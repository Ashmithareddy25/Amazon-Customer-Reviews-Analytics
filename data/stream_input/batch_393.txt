B00005YU98|4.0|This was the first Waterboys album I ever bought, and I remember laying that slab of vinyl on the Dual and being blown away by the full envelope of sound.  This remastered release sounds infinitely better than the original CD release, even if you're not a total audiophile.  The new additions are pretty good, but frankly I find that &quot;bonus tracks&quot; tend to distract from the song cycle that was the original album.  (Can you imagine Abbey Road with bonus tracks?  Seems to cheapen the original effort.)<br />As for the two &quot;restored&quot; songs, however, I do take issue with Mike Scott on those.  &quot;All The Things She Gave Me&quot; does appear to be a slightly longer, more satisfying version.  However, &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; replaces the original vocal track with a much more bluesy/meandering lead vocal which has a very different feel from the original sparse, haunting vocals on this song.  I still have my original CD of this album for that reason: &quot;The Thrill is Gone&quot; here on this re-issue is not just an &quot;unedited&quot; version, as listed on the cover and in the liner notes.  The original is probably my favorite Waterboys songs ever, so hearing it here with an overly self-indulgent vocal track bugs me.  Perhaps you'll like it more, but it put me off.<br />(On a side note, &quot;The Live Adventures of the Waterboys&quot; has the most amazing medly of &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; with &quot;The Healing Has Begun&quot; which is really terrific, as is the &quot;Because the Night/Pan Within&quot; on that same collection.  Wow.  Highly recommended.)<br />Overall, I'd give this re-issue a thumbs up for the excellent sound and most of the bonus tracks, which are fine songs,though it's unclear how they fit into the album concept.  I just wish artists wouldn't use re-issues as a way of tinkering with classic works.  (George Lucas should have kept his hands off the original Star Wars movies as well.)
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|&quot;Waking The Fallen&quot; (4/5): Just an intro, nothing special.<BR>&quot;Unholy Confessions&quot; (3/5): Awesome bass, song does nothing for me.<BR>&quot;Chapter Four&quot; (4/5): A real high point of the album, great tune.<BR>&quot;Remenissions&quot; (3/5): Nothing above average on this track.<BR>&quot;Descecrate Through Reverance&quot; (5/5): My favorite song, period.<BR>&quot;Eternal Rest&quot; (4/5): This tune will keep you jumpin'.<BR>&quot;Second Heartbeat&quot; (4/5): The album doesn't slow down with this one.<BR>&quot;Radiant Eclipse&quot; (3/5): A song that just doesn't do anything for me.<BR>&quot;I Won't See You Tonight 1&quot; (4/5): An awesome rock anthem.<BR>&quot;I Won't See You Tonight 2&quot; (3/5): Too much yelling but nothing to say.<BR>&quot;Clairvoyant Disease&quot; (4/5): Another high point of the album.<BR>&quot;And All Things Will End&quot; (4/5): A great closing track.
B00000J2SO|3.0|Since Dungeons &amp; Dragons singer Ronnie James Dio was gone (one of the best rock singers ever - one of the worst rock lyricists ever!) Blackmore decided to make some money fast (as if he did not have enough of it, apparently...) and went for a totally commercial sound with DOWN TO EARTH. The trouble (or advantage) is that, with a line-up of Bonnet, Blackmore, Glover, Airey and Powell, even a half-baked album has a lot of moments of brilliance, given the amazing skills of these musicians.<br />DOWN TO EARTH is a plesant album to listen, very well produced, but can´t hold a candle to LONG LIVE ROCK´n ROLL, for example. Graham Bonnet´s performance is amazing, man this guy can sing, but the &quot;love lyrics&quot; are utterly boring, and all of a sudden we have in a Rainbow album a song title &quot;Since You Been GOone&quot; (Not a bad song, by the way), &quot;Love Is Not A Friend&quot;, &quot;Making Love&quot;...
B00006BTCA|2.0|&quot;Untitled&quot; (2/5): Nothing thrilling about this opener.<BR>&quot;Obstacle 1&quot; (3/5): This song is average, but nothing more.<BR>&quot;NYC&quot; (2/5): Another song that just doesn't float my boat.<BR>&quot;Pda&quot; (3/5): Finally a song that at least renders about three and a half stars, but still nothing memorable.<BR>&quot;Say Hello To The Angels&quot; (4/5): Probably the highpoint of the album.<BR>&quot;Hands Away&quot; (2/5): A decent song, at best.<BR>&quot;Obstacle 2&quot; (4/5): This song is pretty good, another highpoint.<br />&quot;Stella Was A Diver And Was Always Down&quot; (3/5): This song is decent.<BR>&quot;Roland&quot; (4/5): A cool guitar riff drives this one.<BR>&quot;The New&quot; (3/5): Don't know what to say about this track, but it's average.<BR>&quot;Leif Erikson&quot; (2/5): A less than thrilling finale to a less than thrilling album.<br />Perhaps I have these feelings because I went into listening to this album with very high expectations. All my friends kept telling me that Interpol were the best indie band second only to the Strokes. I, however, did not really find any appealing about this album. Boring and dreary are the words that come to mind when i think about listening to this album. A dissapointing release.<br />Rating: Two stars.
B00005NWM3|1.0|when i look at these guys all i can think of is Nirvana &quot;is that such a bad thing&quot; no it isnt............but the difference between Nirvana and Nikelback is Nikelback sucks major ass they are just mainstream rockers that want to be famous allt he time.......i hate bands like that i mean being on mainstream is cool but to sell out and hear your song on the radio 30 million times is hella annoying i mean damn enough is enough.look at it this way Tool is mainstream rock sorta not really but they dont outplay tool songs because Tool kicks ass thats why yeah thats right Nikelback you loser poser whining pieces of crap learn your lesson and back off that mic you cant sing worth crap and the guitars are just lame the drums are stupid everything about Nikelback sucks and for people who like this are retarded i mean it just sucks there might be like 4 seconds worth of something that is atcually good one one song and thats not saying much crappy band trsut me
B000002UB3|5.0|the lyrics suggest a connection to advanced physics, with the title naming a well-known expert in the field..or this is what was suggested to me many years ago..does anyone concur? when paul and john collaborate, there's usually a higher consciousness achieved! highly underrated song!
B00008OLYN|5.0|This music is emotional, deep, and makes you think....very excellent and i must say one of the best albums of 2003 you can tell that this album is marvelous just from the opening song &quot;Windowpane&quot; which is just awesome and the vocals are beautiful the next song &quot;In My Time Of Need&quot; is very good it is like kick ass and slow at the same time all in all you want a good album get this awesome work i must say.......linkin park is trash compared to bands like this
B00008BRB5|5.0|With Synchronicity, the Police's 1983 swansong, it was clear that they had reached a peak that was also a cul-de-sac, that their style had evolved as far as it could go, but at least it was a triumph that yielded them their only US #1 single.  The Police had a big hit with their previous release with &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot;, so the followup would've yielded a belly flop or a swan dive.  Synchronicity is clearly the latter.<br />Gossamer keyboards, pneumatic drumming forming the backbone, guitar riffs introduce the title track, which weaves scientific and psychological principles with something Carl Jung studied, i.e. synchronicity.  One of their best songs.<br />An open letter to a dinosaur?  Sting discusses the similarities between those &quot;terrible lizards&quot; and man, the lords of the Earth in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras respectively.  Of course, the dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago (that first lyric 50 million years might mean geology wasn't up Sting's alley) due to the asteroid collision.  Are we humans, by having atom bombs, &quot;Walking In Your Footsteps&quot;?  Are we museum-bound too then?<br />Now a complaint to God, set to a brisk bass and keyboards.  &quot;O My God&quot; explores the usual issues of loneliness and asks God to &quot;take the space between us and fill it up some way.&quot;  Oh, Sting takes lyrics from an older song, something he would do a lot on his solo albums.  Here, uses the first verse of &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic.&quot;<br />The straitjacket rhythm and sounds of &quot;Mother&quot; along with Sting's loud demented vocals qualify this as either one of the worst Police songs ever or an eerie and weird novelty penned by Andy Summers, like what &quot;Revolution 9&quot; was to the Beatles.  The Freudian Oedipal complex concept that men tend to marry women that resemble their mothers is key here:  &quot;Well, every girl I go out with becomes my mother in the end.&quot;  Extra padding needed and make sure those straps are tight.<br />Is &quot;Miss Gradenko&quot; experiencing a kind of personal glasnost two years before Gorbachev came into power?  After all, &quot;your uniform doesn't fit/you're much too alive in it.&quot;  The equating of true feelings with anti-communism.<br />&quot;Synchronicity II&quot; is by far the most interesting song, as it takes the frustrations of a factory worker whose unrewarding life at home, work, and on the way back from work may cause him to snap.  Intercut with his story is a brief reference to something crawling out of a dark Scottish lake.  By the time the husband gets back home, it's in front of a cottage.  The monster clearly represents the dark side of his nature.  A wonderful rocker with a pulsing bass.<br />The timelessness of &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; and that opening bass line, the constant rhythm guitar, those relaxing and uplifting keyboards in the midsection makes this one of my favourite songs of all time, although that &quot;I'll be watching you&quot; line does make it a bit on the obsessive side.  It got the Grammy for Record of the Year in 1983, and it spent 8 weeks at Billboard's top spot.  One of my personal favourites.<br />The next single, the Top Five &quot;King Of Pain,&quot; demonstrates the interconnectedness of politico-social consciousness.  Be it the &quot;skeleton choking on a crust of bread&quot;, &quot;a blue whale beached on a springtide's ebb,&quot; that's his soul up there.<br />Another Top Ten single with its organ-like keyboards, the moody &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot; demonstrates the classic reversal between master and servant.  Sting's classics knowledge is apparent, referring to Faust, Scylla and Charybdis from the Odyssey.<br />The curious &quot;Tea In The Sahara&quot; is a languid airy number that foresees Dream Of The Blue Turtles, as does the moody piano jazz of &quot;Murder By Numbers,&quot; a guide to how to become a murderer, with a pointed punchline: &quot;but you can reach the top of your profession/if you become the leader of the land/for murder is the sport of the elected/and you don't need to lift a finger of your hand.&quot;<br />So, from the punk of Outlandos D'Amour, the reggae of Regatta de Blanc, up to Synchronicity, the chapter to the Police closed abruptly, except for the remake of &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me.&quot;nchline: &quot;but you can reach the top of your profession/if you become the leader of the land/for murder is the sport of the elected/and you don't need to lift a finger of your hand.&quot;<br />So, from the punk of Outlandos D'Amour, the reggae of Regatta de Blanc, up to Synchronicity, the chapter to the Police closed abruptly, except for the remake of &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me.&quot;

B0000DIXN7|4.0|If your buying this thinking your going to get a normal R&amp;B/Soul album then you might be a bit dissapointed.<BR>None of the songs on here will have chart success simply due to the fact that the tracks on here are much to mature for today's pop charts.<BR>Amy's Voice is superb. Sounding like a 50's Jazz singer, her voice is hypnotic.<BR>The content of her songs are very real, although very feminine which makes a male listener like myself respect her but at the same time there is a slight annoyance with what she is saying (what is it about men).<br />Track 1 <BR>Intro / Stronger Than Me<BR>A storming start. Stronger than Me is a fantastic song and one of (if not the) best song on the album. This is as much soul as your going to get. The beat is heavy and her words are honest and real. 9<br />Track 2<BR>You Sent Me Flying / Cherry<BR>Another storming track. My favourite in terms of her vocal ability. Its quite a chilled track, and once again her lyrics are very real. Simply about a woman being dumped and being a bit shocked about it. <BR>After this track ends it goes into another track called &quot;Cherry&quot;. Amy shows her funny side. You've got to read the words to this one, fun stuff. 9<br />Track 3<BR>Know You Now<BR>It seems as though Amy is talking about a one night stand here. &quot;I've gotta know you now, we may never meet again&quot;.<BR>Bit more upbeat here and once again her voice is in fine working order. 7<br />Track 4<BR>F**k Me Pumps<BR>Yep thats what it says! Another track with humorus content. Basically her issues turn to women who are just looking for a one night stand and have no life!<BR>Her voice is a tiny bit drony on this one, but the lyrics are clever. 7<br />Track 5<BR>I Heard Love Is Blind<BR>Its only 2 minutes 10 seconds long, but if your thinking about buying this album, just buy it for this! Its hilarious. She is defending herself cheating by saying &quot;he looked like you&quot;. <BR>Unmissible. 9<br />Track 6<BR>Mood's Mood For Love<BR>A reggae style track. Her voice here is what shes about. Soft and has some real soul to it. Amy shows her different style of vocal range and style of music on this one. 7<br />Track 7 <BR>There Is No Greater Love<BR>She really sounds like someone like Nina Simone on this one. Its some deep jazz stuff. Best Song for her voice. 8<br />Track 8 <BR>In My Bed<BR>If you are familar with Rap star 'Nas' then you will notice that the backing track on here is the same backing track on 'Made you Look' from the album 'God's Son' by Nas.<BR>Once again the voice goes a little bit into the annoying catogary. But its still a track that musically i'm feeling. 7<br />Track 9 <BR>Take The Box<BR>Now this is fantastic. The best track on the album by a country mile. The atomosphere surrounding this song is only something you can understand by listening to it. Its cool, calm but she makes her point. Its a very powerful track. 10<br />Track 10<BR>October Song<BR>Bit more upbeat. Which I felt this album need more of. <BR>October song is an average track though. In my opinion a 'filler'. Not the best. 5<br />Track 11<BR>What Is It About men<BR>Another cool track. With the addition of this song it really goes to show that the title of this album is fitting. She is frank and honest. 7<br />Track 12<BR>Help Yourself<BR>I Like this one. Bit more postive in terms of its tune. Catchy chorus, and a nice song to chill out too. 7<br />Track 13<BR>Amy Amy Amy<BR>I can't seem to get into this one. As an r&amp;b/soul boy its difficult for me to say much about this song but its long, and very boring. 4<br />Overall<BR>Shes a talent, and there are tracks on here for lots of music lovers.<BR>As a rnb/soul artist, there are some tracks she does so very well. Others simply are not my thing.<BR>He voice is very different and this album is not the same old thing. Its a very impressive debut although I don't like all the songs. That is testement to the great tracks on here that really are great.<BR>I reccommend you check this out.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's 4th album , to me, is her personal best. She has grown up and still growing and her music and her different melodic ventures displays that. She took me by surprise as I was slightly reluctant to buy this cd because I was some-what disappointed with her last cd \\"Britney.\\" Yet after hearing and grooving  to \\"Me Against the Music\\" and  the addictive song \\"Toxic,\\" I had to purchase her cd and I'm glad I did.<br />Britney explores sounds such as R&B (\\"Outrageous\\" produced & written by R. Kelly), Rap (\\"(I got that) Boom Boom\\" featuring the Ying Yang Twinz) among other sounds which work well with her voice and style. I was surprised that I actually found a cd that I like almost every LAST song. The only songs I dislike are \\"(I got that) Boom Boom.\\" I hate the Ying Yang Twinz (with all that yelling and their annoying voices, ugh, totally unnecessary). They make the song really bad, seriously and the pair up is unbelievable and downright odd. I think she should have done a song with Ludacris or even Chingy, it would have made the song worth listening to. \\"Shadow\\" starts out promising with good lyrical arrangement and a terrific beat but the chorus ruins it for me, kind of cheesy to me, like an 80`s song of some sort. \\"Touch of My Hand\\" is a TMI (Too much information) type song. I mean, what was she thinking when she made that song? (Well, um, actually, I think we ALL know what she was thinking, the question is WHY would she put it on a cd?)<br />Standout songs are tracks: #1, #3, #5, #6, #7, #9, #12<br />Here's a track by track rating of \\"In the Zone\\"<br />1. Me Against the Music 5/5 <BR>(Cool dance song)<br />2. (I got that) Boom Boom 2/5<BR>(YUCK!)<br />3. Showdown 5/5<BR>(Love the beat and local arrangement)<br />4. Breathe On Me 3.5/5<BR>(Eh, ok song. I can take it or leave it. It is sensual though)<br />5. Early mornin' 4/5 <BR>(A well produced sassy song)<br />6. Toxic 5/5 <BR>(YES!! Excellent song)<br />7. Outrageous 5/5 <BR>(Another outstanding song)<br />8. Touch of my hand 3/5 <BR>(Personally, I really don't want to know Britney Spears all like that, but hey, you might *perv* LoL)<br />9. The Hook Up 5/5 <BR>(Fantastic reggae smooth vibe type song! This girl out did herself with this cd!!)<br />10. Shadow 2/5 <BR>(UGH!)<br />11. Brave New Girl 4/5 <BR>(Very sugary pop but I don't mind)<br />12. Everytime 5/5 <BR>(Emotional well put together slow song that is one of my favs)<br />13. Me Against the Music (remix) 4/5<BR>(Good work out/dance song like the original song)<br />Grade: A<br />Recommend it?: Absolutely! (To those over 18 of course. Britney Spears isn't 17 years old singing about, \\"Soda pop/watch it fizz and pop.\\" She's a young adult exploring her sexuality and experiencing adulthood, nothing preteens-young teens could EVER relate to so please don't buy it for your child or any child for that matter. Listen to your kid's music before purchasing it, it makes you a RESPONSIBLE parent. I'm tired of parents getting mad at the artists when YOU'RE the one in charge of what YOUR child listens to, watches, etc. So get a grip.) <br />Anyway, this cd is beyond good and deserves more credit than it is receiving. Buy this cd and you be the judge.

0679411585|5.0|I own 20-30 books written about the Veitnam War.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is such a touching movie. And its soundtrack is \\"two thumbs up\\" as well. I went to see the movie with very high expectations, due to the popular acclaim it has received, and now I think it even surpasses all of that. Actually, I think this unique movie is far beyond any praise or criticism, that doesn't really matter at the end of the day, not even the several Golden Globes it won and its 4 Oscars nominations (it won one), its tremendous and forever lasting things are its humanity, its profound emotions, its platonic desires (so common among us humans), and its immense love for life despite the dislocation, frustration, disappointment, and loneliness of Bob and Charlotte (the main characters in the movie, majestically played by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson). The movie is characterized by a minimalist, eerie, dream-like ambient which is perfectly conveyed by the songs on the soundtrack. More than anything, the movie and its music are an emotional and powerful portrayal of the feelings and views about life of many of us here in this world. The soundtrack has several breathtaking songs, like My Bloody Valentine's \\"Sometimes\\", Death In Vegas' \\"Girls\\", and Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's &quot;Just Like Honey&quot;. Some excellent songs in the soundtrack are sadly too short, this jewel of a movie is not long enough either.   <BR>Obviously, judging by the other reviews here, some people (for whatever reason) are not able to understand the artistry and purpose of the film, that's OK, we are all different. What I find ridiculous, however, is those that easily say the movie is pointless, plotless, senseless, too slow, and so on. It is actually pointless and senseless to say that. Perhaps some people don't have the right state of mind to get the subtle \\"plot\\" of the movie, or are simply not willing to do so. Of course it is entertainment after all, yes, but I wonder if only extra sensible, very emotional, introspective, and also maybe romantic people can fully appreciatethe intent writer and director Sofia Coppola had for this movie, for its soundtrack, and for its two beautiful main characters. An unforgettable piece of art, both visually and sonically, but mostly spiritually.
0385504209|3.0|First, the good points. Brown either did meticulous research or he has a vivid imagination; the fact that I can't decide which or how much of each he used is a virtue of the book, not a flaw. Architecture, art and religion get a better, more thorough (if fictional) treatment than they receive in most popular novels. Either way, the details that form the background and motivation for the story worked very well for me. The story moves quite quickly. For most of the book - save one or two transparent plot twists - the Brown's story kept me turning the pages. This is a excellent basic premise and creative creation.<br />Now the bad news. The hype behind this book has been excessive. This is \\"Indiana Jones in Paris\\", with a melodramatic, frustratingly weak ending, and none of Jones' panache. The characters, especially the male and female leads, are humorless, colorless (readers of the book will detect the bad pun in this comment) and unable to earn my sympathy, interest or affection. Nelson DeMille does a much better job in this genre, with colorful, funny male leads and dashing, daring damsels. Jack Higgins used to write like this before he started to become repetitive. Some of the plot turns seem to be signaled well in advance. Without revealing them, suffice it to say, anyone with a smattering of knowledge about Da Vinci will easily see through one of the clues that sees to baffle our experts.<br />For those who find the book to be demeaning to or libelous of Catholics, Opus Dei or other real or fictional religious sects, all I can say is \\"this is fiction,\\" and leave it at that. Enjoy what you can of the artistic elements but be prepared for disappointment in the end.

B00005JKGK|2.0|I had to read the Book and watch the movie in school and I did not like either of them. I had to also write a movie review for it so im gunna publish it to the whole world to see. Hope this helps anyone who is thinking about watching this movie or buying the book. Also there are a few spoilers in this review so be forwarned but their isnt anything that really ruins the story, wait what am i saying the story is to mixed up to really understand in the first place that it shouldnt make much of a difference. O well here goes nothing:<br />     The \\"Joy Luck Club\\" was just an average film due to its soap opera-like quality and random flashbacks. This made me confused by sending the plot into all different tangents and directions. When a book changes time frames, the reader can go back and re-read sections if need be. In a movie setting, however, the viewer cannot turn back and rewind the lost moments and the time frames quickly occur. The movie features only fine looking Chinese daughters who are part of this \\"Joy Luck Club.\\" I felt that this was an unrealistic portrayal, as in the real world; there are many types of people. The \\"Joy Luck Club\\" is not explained to the audience and assumes that all have read the book prior to this movie. This movie was directed by Wayne Wang and the screen play was written by Amy Tan, who also wrote the book. <br />     This movie begins in San Francisco where a party is being held for Jing-Mei \\"June Woo\\". She has been given money to go to China to see her two lost sisters. Jing-Mei June Woo is played by Ming-Na.  The movie followed closely to the book in some respects by not others.  For instance, during the red candle scene in the movie, there was no mention of the importance of the candle. The chapters in the book were scrambled when they appeared in the movie.<br />     The acting was inconsistent. At the end of the film when she meets her sisters for the first time they do not seem to be reacting to each other. One of the women who is supposed to be the sister, also played the mother of June in a flashback. Andrew McCarthy who played Ted Jordan did a good acting performance and sold the scenes he was in, such as the scene where he told his mother off. Some of the mothers, such as Ying Ying and Lena Saint Clair who were played by France Nuyen and Lauren Tom respectively, made me want to laugh because of some of their unrealistic portrayals of overly broken Chinese accented English.<br />     The plot was sporadic at times and seemed to take away from the original story line to the point that was irritating. The whole movie was a series of flashbacks that each person lived through.  There was originally a party at the beginning of the movie, but then the scenes would quickly shift backwards in time to each person's life. I liked the transition that the director made when June's father talked about her mother's past because he explained what the mother had experienced. The flashback of best quality, however, didn't quite fit into the movie where it had been placed. It seemed to throw the viewer into the scene without hesitation. This movie was also quite choppy with too many events occurring in rapid sequence which began to lose steam while becoming dull and redundant. Three out of the four mothers seem to have lived the same story comprised of a bad marriage followed by a divorce and remarriage with many trials and tribulations along the way.<br />     The themes were spelled out much more in the movie than in the book. The feather that was given to June was explained to her by her father without subtlety. The mother who sacrificed her life for her daughter was also played out and the reasons for it were amply described by the daughter. There was one theme that was explained in the end of \\"Best Quality\\". The scene was not portrayed or shown in the beginning of the flash back scene. <br />     This book, turned movie, would be better for an older audience, such as 40 and up. It is more of a \\"woman's movie\\" with a sappy ending that most men probably wouldn't like, me included. I give this movie a C, but would probably receive a B from a more mature viewer who may be more interested in true life situations as opposed to comedy or action movies that a younger viewer might enjoy. <br />     I would give this 2 1/2 stars but I could only select either 2 or 3 which is why I selected 2. Hope this helps!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I'm not going to fall into the trap of reviewing the reviews here, some of which are utterly mindless. I've watched at least two movies a week for the past thirty years, not counting reruns on TV. That's a lot of movies, well over 3,000, but I still love them even though we do go through periods when everything that comes to the movie-house is garbage. Last year was a good year. One of the best in the past decade. And &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was one of the best movies. (I also thought &quot;Big Fish&quot; was brilliant and Tim Burton's best movie so far.)<br />Watching so many movies I can't tell you how sick I get of coming out of the theater knowing that I've just been treated like a lobotomized dummy by film makers who think all movie goers are thirteen year old boys with too many hormones who like to see things blow up. <br />Sophia Coppola, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson treated me like an adult with enough brain to care about real people making a connection in a strange context. I can hardly praise this movie enough. The low budget does not show, it just serves to make you focus on human details. But then it is always cheaper to make a film about people than about special effects.<br />I'm bored with movies without characters. I love this one because it had characters and I could care about them. And to those who didn't find it funny, you probably wouldn't like Buster Keaton either. Murray's humor is so deadpan it had me cracking up. Not all humor has to be telegraphed. An unforgettable trip to Tokyo in the company of two people who you really hope will find a little happiness in this world.
0316926345|5.0|This is a fairly sizeable novel. It would normally take me about three days with pretty substantial reading time during those days. But there was just something about it, and I made time and read this one pretty much straight through. It is easily one of the most wonderful novels I have ever read.<br />There is so much to like about it. There is sheer joy in reading Waugh's prose as small nuggets of humor and beauty are uncovered throughout. The characters are pretty over-the-top (done on purpose) which makes them entertaining, but the depth of the characters is the truly striking thing. It's usually between the lines, but these characters are changing dramatically throughout, and for the better. I think the theological discussion running throughout the novel is what really makes it rise to true greatness. Waugh's making a compelling argument for a moral universe, and he is revealing what God's grace may look like working in people's lives. <br />Brideshead Revisited is true masterpiece that really cannot be missed by any lover of literature or by any person looking for some meaning out there. It's a joy in every sense of the word. This is one book I'm going to come back to.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|I think Peter Pan is a movie for all ages and is very exciting.  There is action, romance, comedy and much more.  If you want to find out more, you have to watch the movie! I think it is the best movie of all time!
006092988X|5.0|This book was one of the most genuinely touching books I have ever read.  I read it when I was just 13.  Back then, I had many stressers in my life, and this book helped me identify with other people.  I realized that Francie, the main character, was just like me.  I saw myself in her and my father in her father.  It was touching and very interesting- I picked it up and was immediately sucked in.  I finished it in two days!  In conclusion, one cannot possibly live their life without reading this amazingly profound classic.  It has influenced my life and opened my eyes.  Thank you, and good night.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Gangs of New York was the best movie of 2002 and the <BR>best movies of all time!Daniel Day-Lewis should have won <BR>best actor!  This movie was a lot better then Chicago.  Some <BR>people didn't like it because they said it was mostly violence, <BR>but it isn't just a movie where it has all violence and no plot.  <BR>I don't like Leonardo DiCaprio but he did a pretty good job. <BR>If you want to find out about a rarely discussed part of history <BR>or just want to see an amazing movie Gangs of New York is <br />definitely worth seeing!
038572179X|4.0|Unlike some readers, I do think this book was quite predictable.  Certain little nuances in the text intimated what was to come.<BR>That is not the point.<BR>McEwan gives no implication that he wishes to surprise the reader with an unpredictable ending.<BR>His merit is in his ability to create an extremely psychologically challenging book.<BR>Good art makes you question.<BR>McEwan did so.<BR>Having said that, there is an element of the contrived in this novel, and if you are looking for something completely novel, you will be disappointed (excuse the pun).<BR>It should have won the Booker over Vernon God Little.
0141439831|5.0|It is impossible to compare this to any other 19th century English novel, or to compare Thackery with Dickens, or anyone else.  That being said, it's almost as if there was a Mendelian cross between the astute (and gentle) social observations of Jane Austen, and the savage and bitter analysis of human nature of Jonathan Swift. <BR>Regarding the novel's pace, the author presents a complex, rounded view of the numerous characters, major and minor, and this couldn't have been done at a best-seller type pace.  Every character is a mixture of good and evil, of weakness and strength. <BR>This is a work to be savored for its' wisdom - and I believe there is a great deal of wisdom in the novel.  Above all, I don't see how it's not possible to not be fascinated by the two female &quot;heroines,&quot; nor to want to know what theie eventual fates are.  A GREAT, PROFOUND WORK OF IMAGINATION.
0380977788|5.0|In this fantastic book, Gaimon taps into nightmares most people aren't aware they had to create a truly frightening story. Most authors would be uneasy about putting children in such a high-stakes situation, but Gaiman doesn't flinch. A father himself, he knows that children are a lot more resilient that most adults give them credit for--proven by the hundreds of enthusiastic grade-school fans who have written him at his website. Unlike the Lemony Snicket books, the horrifying events portrayed here are told in a low-key, deadpan style which makes them even more effective.<br />Also check out the unabridged audiobook, read very effectively by the author himself. The background music is wonderfully eerie, and the rat choruses are spine-tinglingly creepy.
B00006879E|5.0|When I first heard Maroon 5 I thought, &quot;Great, another pop band.&quot; This thought was immediately followed by intense regret for having thought it. These guys are incredible. A versitile vocalist backed by a straight funk band, mixed with some serious beats. You dont need rap anymore to pound the subs in your car. Awesome.
B000002MX7|5.0|This woman is incredible; She is like a hit machine. She can just hum a song and it seems like it just becomes an instant hit. This is one of the women who put the letter&quot;D&quot; in Diva.<BR>She has such a wonderful voice she can sing and she can remake a song and turn it out. For example, she had did a remake of the Jackson 5 hit &quot;Got to Be There&quot; she did it wonderfully and she also re-done &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; . <br />Also, she was with the group &quot;Rufus&quot; of course. <BR>She had so many hits with Rufus and she left the group and had went solo and did very well on her own and still is today.  This album contains some of her best songs but is is missing a few of her best songs: Got To Be There and Love You all My Lifetime.  This is a great Chaka Khan cd and it is wonderful and has a lot of wonderful songs on here and contains a lot of my solo favorites and I love this whole album and would reccomend anyone who enjoyed the group Rufus/ Chaka Khan to purchase this album because you would definitely enjoy it!!!!!!
0671027387|5.0|I am a fan of Dan Brown and enjoy all of his work (anything he writes is wonderful in my book), but &quot;Decpetion Point,&quot; has got to be one of his best to date!  I was hooked from beginning to end!
0385335482|2.0|I was excited about reading this book, having thoroughly enjoyed Bridget Jones Diary as well as the Edge of Reason.  Around the 3rd chapter of this book, I had already constructed in my mind what would probably happen in this book...and it did. The predictability of the book bored me to tears as well as the characaters lack of any morals or self-control.  Sophie Kinsella could have given the character at least a small amount of intelligence or ambition.  She cared nothing about her career or herself as a person.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I heard a lot of good things about the movie and was very anxious to see it. I rented this movie with high expectations and was sorely disappointed. There was no point to the story as far as I could see. The reviews said this movie was hilarious; I sat through this movie for an hour and didn't find anything funny. It just jumps from one scene to the next with no purpose, this makes for a very boring movie. Although that is not to say that no one will like this movie, as the saying goes &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot;. However, I would not recommend this movie at all.
B00003RQNJ|3.0|I first saw this film in 1971 in the movie theater when I was a kid. I thought it was great. My opinion has changed. It's not so great now that I see it as an adult. I think half of the problem is the very flower/1960's/Carpenter's style music put in by BJ Thomas with \\"Rain Drops Keep Falling On My Head\\". Some of the other music throughout the film is very much unbefitting a western.        The comparison I make it to are the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns that were made in '64 to '67. The music still holds up better than the background music for Butch and Sundance. I would not consider this movie a classic. I think if someone came along to re-score the music it would being it closer to being a classic film.  This film is no \\"Godfather.\\" This film is too much \\"Hollywood\\" western and obviously American filmmakers hadn't learned from the Italian Clint Eastwood westerns from 1964-1967. The film is entertaining, but the music gets in the way too much. The film has a whole aura of 70's attached to it. If the music was re-scored, I think it would fair better. Sorry folks.
0780020693|5.0|A stunning, gorgeous work. The seemingly accidental colliding of scenes, which come and go as memories do, is what makes Fellini's Amarcord (I remember) such a perfect depiction of one's memories of youth. It feels like a collection of moments so bright and vibrant, that it is totally believable that it would be those that the central figure, Titta, would remember. Fellini remembers his own childhood, of course, through Titta in Amarcord, and the help of a lot of fantasy and fiction, which Fellini loves to deploy in order to reach penetrating truth. Rich colours, cinematography, and a beautiful Nino Rota score also help create the dreamlike feel of memory. Fellini had such a sense for movement - both of the camera, and for the arrangement of figures in the frame (also known as mise-en-scene), and though it is nearly impossible to pick a favourite Fellini work, this sense works here just as marvellously and hypnotically as it does in 8 1/2. Amarcord is an enrapturing film - truly a thing to behold
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Personally, I didn't like this movie, don't know why my, sister wanted the DVD. Don't even know why she showed it to me and nevertheless, I'm not a big fan of Julia Roberts. This movie stinks. No other words. In my opinion it sucked. It might be good to someone else. I don't care. But am I not here to talk about the DVD? Yada yada its a great dvd. WHY? Cause I love special features. Ehh... Not really exciting special features though. yawn... Theres still one good reason to get this dvd. Its got kirsten dunst. The girl from spiderman. And any friend of spiderman is a friend of mine. (her acting sucked in this movie) (i'm not a geek or a comic book freak or a dungeons and dragons or chess player)
B00005JMJ4|1.0|oh my god. I just hated this movie. The only good thing about it was the acting, specially Murray's. This movie has no plot, it is way too long (or feels like it), and it is supposed to be a commedy and i barely laughed a couple of times (when they made the japanese people look stupid, which by the way i would feel very offending if i were japanese) When i saw this movie yesterday there were about 15 people in the theater and only 4, counting myself and a friend, went through the whole movie. It was amazingly boring, i don't get how this movie got nominated for best picture and director, and a great movie such as cold mountain was left out. I don't get it, it was stupid, i don't recomend it to anyone. BOOOOOOOOOOORING
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarentino's Kill Bill Vol 1 is the first movie of it's kind I have ever seen.  Although it has very painfully obvious references to Kung Fu movies of the seventies, including, but not exclusive to, the very suit that The Bride wears for most of the end of the movie.  I fully believe that this movie could be labeled under the dark comedy genre, in that many of the jokes involved in the movie range from the fact that The Bride's name is disguised by a censor beep, to her spanking the so-called body guard with her sword, to the Monty Python blood spurt that encites a humorous reaction from the audience.  Yes, I did laugh almost every time someone lost a limb, and the absurd fountain of blood shot out.<BR>Despite how the movie has been either insulted profanely, or praised emphatically, I enjoyed it for every minute the screen was lit.  From the moment the Klingon proverb was projected to the point where Bill asks Sophie . . . oops, I almost said too much.  If you think you might be interested in this movie you will probably love it instead . . . so try it!<BR>Kill Bill; it's not just a movie, it's an assassination!
6304779356|5.0|i didnt grow up in the 80's so i dont know how well this movie did in the box office and stuff but i know its a great movie. the casting was the best. Kiefer sutherland made the best vampire and by the way he was increadibly hott. To end my review its a must see 80s movie for 80s freaks like me. Also it has some of the 80s hottest stars: Kiefer Sutherland, Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, and Jason Patric.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Alright, I don't expect anyone to care about this review that will quickly be lost in the mass of other reviews, but I have nothing better to do so...<br />After hearing a little bit about Lost in Translation, I was all set up to dislike it. What a great surprise it was to find out that this movie is amazing, defenitely one of the best movies of all time. The way I see it, there are two kinds of movies: movies that have cheap thrills to appeal to the masses (American Pie, XxX), and movies that actually have atmosphere and substance that really convey emotion (Saving Private Ryan, Aliens, and plenty of 'foriegn' movies). Lost in Translation falls into the second category. This movie isn't for the masses. It doesn't have sex related comedy, or amazing special effects. It DOES have a unnecessarily long scenes that seem pointless at first.  Then you start to understand that if it was different, the movie would lose its sense of emotion and surreal atmosphere.<br />So what is it about? It's about two people who find each other in a fancy hotel in Tokyo. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) an Charlotte (Scarlet Johannson) both feel as if their lives arent fulfilling any more. They end up bored in Tokyo, then find each other, then fall in love (in more of a 'soul mate' kind of way then a sexual way).<br />Why doesn't Lost in Translation appeal to so many people (most of them living in the US I might add)? This movie uses imagery more then words. It's the kind of movie that gets better with repeated viewings, because there is so much to absorb. Things must be discovered, instead of spoon-fed to the viewer. There is plenty of humor here, but it's 'classy humor' so to speak. The kind that must be thought about, instead of relying on outrageous statements or events.<br />My last point - this movie does NOT portray racist views. It portrays the quirks of a culture that many of us aren't acquainted with. I'm sure many Japanese have stereotypes about other places as well...it's just the waythings are. To call it racism is blowing this subject a bit out of proportion.<br />Soo, while this DvD could have been done better, the movie is defenitely worth owning...if you are a patient person.
B000003JBM|5.0|I remember getting this CD when it first came out in '93.  I remember liking A Tribe Called Quest, who used jazz samples, and I wanted to get into jazz but wasn't sure where to start.  <br />Well, this isn't exactly a good place to start if you want to get into jazz, but it is a great combination if you're interested in hip-hop flavored with jazz.<br />This was the first Guru Jazzmatazz project and is much better than the following two.  The second one was more hip hop and the third newest one is too neo-soul for me.<br />This is a very good cd for late night, chilling, listening.  Very mellow, very relaxed.  If you're a fan of A Tribe Called Quest's classic stuff, or if you're a fan of classic jazz/hiphop, this is a great album.
B00005JN1L|3.0|Perhaps my expectations were to high as Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors.  This movie started out with a great premise and kept you interested... It seemed a bit slow at times, but you were waiting for the \\"thriller moment\\" -- when it came, it was so uninspired and bland that I walked out of the movie wondering why I had paid matinee price to watch this movie. The ending was terrible, the plot was slow but it had potential, and it just could have been so much more than it was. I recommend this as rental when its no longer a new release, or watch it on TV.
0385510438|3.0|Grisham is a pretty good novelist, and I've read some other stuff, but I was a little disappointed with this one. It seems to drag on a bit and the ending is a bit predictable. <BR>wwr@virginia.edu
B0001EBXBK|1.0|SOOOO disappointing.  <br />This one is just trying to cash in on the big Asian movie invasion (read:  that ridiculous supernatural-Matrix-Crouching Tiger jumping and flipping and swordfight eye-rolling-inducing scenes).  And he just puts layer upon layer of the exact same fight scene (um, didn't anybody own a gun?  I would assume that, yes, even in Japan, the present day weapon of choice when you're in a jam is a good, reliable, automatic hand-held weapon of some sort), I can only assume to astonish the likes of fourteen year old boys.  And these scenes go on...and on...and on...  <br />The acting is probably the worst that I have seen of any of his movies, his character choice is so poor, that I can't believe he's the same guy who cast the Pulp Fiction cast (Samuel Jackson versus Lucy Liu??????  Or Darryl Hannah?  Or Vivica Fox?).  Can we say 'Charlie's Angels' anybody?  Charlie's Angels trying too hard, though.  <br />There was way too much dialogue, and the desperation for it to be witty, clever, and ironic actually had an odour.  More of a stench really.<br />Unless he was trying to resurrect the 'Fox Force 5' idea from Pulp Fiction, with Uma playing the blonde knife expert (though she was more of a swordswoman in this flick), I can't see any intelligence in it.  Oh, and when Uma does the 'square' trace in the air in Kill Bill, it may have been a little bit more nostalgic if he had (since I would assume he pasted that into Kill Bill from Pulp Fiction intentionally) insinuated a dotted outline of the trace, as he had in the originating movie.<br />If you're looking for a good samurai fight scene, I hate to admit  it, but The Last Samurai had some good scenes.  And of course, if any sword will do, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was pretty amazing.  If you're looking  for action and comedy, any Jackie Chan would do.  If you're looking for something Japanese in an action flavour (with American overtones) see Black Rain.  There is a good decapitation scene if you'reworried you'll miss out on it.  And if you're looking for  something clever in the inimitable style of Tarantino, re-rent Pulp Fiction.  Or Reservoir Dogs.
0140177396|5.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck remains properly on the reading lists of high school students because of the regional imagery through succinct dialogue. Unlike \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" Steinbeck brings us swiftly into each moment, never letting us linger too long before walking us to the next place.<br /><br />The American Dream has many variations, but always, it is about independence and the pride of being one's own man. Lennie and George want this independence more than most men, but have less than most men to get there. In their case, it isn't a white picket fence, but a farm where they can raise rabbits.<br /><br />Lennie is not a bright man. He desires to care for someone and to be loved, but is unable to think past his own fear. George tries to protect him, but he too, although smarter than Lennie, is managed by his insecurity and foolishness.<br /><br />The story surrounds Lennie and George's efforts to get and retain work on ranch near Soledad, and more so, toward their American Dream. The big picture is always with them, but it is the day-by-day difficulties they have with being outsiders. Their intrinsic inability to be free is sheer tragedy, as they both fail again and again to make the right decision.<br /><br />It's a lonely story about two men who hope more than they can think, who are destined by their misery never to enjoy true companionship and happiness.<br /><br />Few books are as thematically pure as \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" which follows Man's search for self and meaning carefully. It is harsh in language and image, and the abstract ideas might be too much for younger readers to comprehend, but any intelligent teen will gain from it where John Knowles' \\"A Separate Peace\\" and J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" leave off.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
0385512104|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night by Mark Haddon is one of the most unique books I have ever read.  Essentially it is the \\"journal\\" of Christopher John Francis Boone, an autistic 15 year old English schoolboy.  One evening he finds a neighbors dog dead, the poor animal having been impaled by a garden pitchfork.  Initially Christopher is presumed to be the perpetrator of the crime.  It turns out he is, in fact innocent.  Christopher resolves to find the actual perpetrator over the objections of nearly everyone about him-except for his school counselor who urges him to go ahead and keep a journal of his discoveries-the text of this book.<br />To call the book quixotic is an understatement.  It reflects the internal schizoid aspects and contradictions of Christopher's mind.  He is a brilliant mathematician yet ignorant of the most mundane human emotions.  The dissonance extends to even the numbering of the chapters, which are successive prime numbers.<br />This stands as the best window into the aspects of a disease since I read Jonathan Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn (featuring Tourette's Syndrome).  To read this book is in a very real sense to experience autism.  The unique worldview, the idiosyncratic behaviors, the fears, frustrations, misunderstandings of the wider world and withdrawal into the self of the autistic personality are all there.  This is accomplished not just through effective writing but also through unique us of fonts and graphics in some cases.<br />The book also effectively describes the arc of frustration, exhaustion, fear and anguish that goes along with being close to one with autism.  <br />The story is marked by interesting turns and twists that keep one involved. Haddon has a somewhat distanced yet assessable writing style that provides a distinctly-though not overbearing-English voice to the proceedings.<br />This is an ambitious and accomplished novel.  It's amazing that it is the product of a first time author.  It is a fascinating, absorbing, brilliant romp of a book that I appropriate for readers of nearly all ages.<br />Truly a Five Star effort!
B000002JKA|4.0|If you're used to old school Metal bands like Judas Priest, Anthrax, Metallica (in their better days) and Iron Maiden. Or even newer bands like Iced Earth or Blind Guardian... I'm sure you're aware that the sound Dream Theater makes is VERY different. <br />While I personally prefer bands like Iron Maiden (their riffs are more crunching, their vocals are much better and their songs are altogether more energetic and fun), I still liked 'Awake' by Dream Theater quite a bit. The first instrumental track is VERY impressive. So is 'Innocence Faded', which is my second favorite track. <br />I think this heavier style of Dream Theater's is a much better starting point than 'Scene from a Memory' or anything by Opeth for Meal fans such as myself. <br />So if you're new to Progressive Metal, I recomend trying this first.
B0001IN0DA|2.0|First Thing I think people on here have overated WMXX it could have been a whole lot better.<BR>Hulk Hogan should have been there you just cannot have a Wrestlemania without Hogan hes made the last 2 with his matches with McMahon and The Rock the whole night you could just feel that the event needed a dose of HulkaMania!!<BR>Brock Lesnar and Goldberg should not have been put in a match together each man should have been in the main event from there brand fighting for the title up to WMXX they were the biggest guys on each brandand each deserved title matches.<BR>People say the World Title Match was the best of the night well it took three guys to pull it off! And I dont agree that it should be contested between 3 men WM title matches should be 1on1. But fair play to Benoit he deserved it, but the match should have been Benoit v HHH.<BR>Has The Undertaker changed? I didnt think so other than hes grown his hair abit longer, where were the purple gloves and socks and the pale white face? buried alive??? looks like hes been on holiday to me!<BR>However the best match of the night and the only match that deserves credit was the rock n sock vs evolution this had a great WM feel to it largely delivered by legends Rock and Ric Flair they added that bit of magic to the air. COME BACK FULL TIME ROCK!!!<BR>The other stuff isnt worth covering, Eddie is far too small to be in the WWE title main event and I think he should have dropped the belt to Kurt Angle and the others matches were not worthy of WM.<BR>Overall could have been a much much better event, it really missed Hogan and Bret Hart who are the biggest WM names of all time! Oh well theres always next year. Im sure people will ignore my review but I felt really let down by WMXX.<BR>Please go buy WM18 and WM19 they are much much better.
B0000584V3|3.0|Maybe it's because I am new to the whole Progressive Metal scene.   Or maybe it's because I've just never played a guitar in my life.     But \\"Blackwater Park\\" by Opeth doesn't stimulate my mind like many other Heavy Metal bands.     And these are GREAT bands I'm talking about. The likes of Judas Priest, Metallica (old Metallica that is), Antrax, Iron Maiden, and more recently, Blind Guardian and Iced Earth.    These bands produce songs that sound very different from what you'll hear on `Blackwater Park'. Their songs are much shorter and simpler. Their guitar riffs are more crunching, and their vocals far more soaring. Personally, I think their music is more energetic, catchy and much more of a thrill to hear. (anyone here heard of Iron Maiden ?!?!?!?! )      You can't really jump out of your seat with adrenaline and shriek out the chorus with Opeth. The raw energy just isn't there. And I think that makes the music stale. Don't be mistaken -  I do notice the musical intricacies and complex patterns on the album. But unfortunately I'm just not compelled by them. And that's really the most important thing.     Personally, I think Dream Theater is a more successful Progressive Metal band to bridge that towering gap of musical styles. But 'Blackwater Park' is still worth hearing.  In fact, I urge you to try it. Because it certainly may appeal to you as it clearly has to so many.       Maybe someday I'll get into this kind of Metal. And then maybe I'll fall love with it - but `Blackwater Park' failed to seduce me this time.
B000005QH3|5.0|this movie and soundtrack was one of the early seventies best counterculture films. most people were talking about the girl riding around the desert  nude on the motorcycle. whole film and  soundtrack were fantastic and were popular midnight show offerings for those who remember 70s midnite shows at the movies.
B00005JLKB|5.0|What a great series, as a middle aged adult I have grown up with the Superman Legend an have enjoyed this show immensely. The writers and creators have maintained and remained true to that legend. Tom Welling is the perfect Clark Kent (Superman) and I am looking forward to future seasons (can't wait to see him fly!) as every episode tops it's predecessor.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I never buy soundtracks, actually for that matter I don't purchase much music from cd stores anymore. I went and saw this movie twice, and both times it had an impact on me. The music is perfect for the movie. If you have seen the movie, and purchase the cd, you know what I'm talking about when I say the music of this soundtrack stores us with those images from the movie. In addition, it's great music to listen to when you are just relaxing, having a tough time sleeping, lot's on your mind. Overall, I am pleased that I purchased this cd. I must say when I went to buy it, one place was all sold out. Finally I got myself a copy of it. Great movie, and a great soundtrack. Thanks Mr. Gibson!
B00005A46T|1.0|what disgusts me these days is that some of these bands that have no talent whatsoever are getting paid to scream into a microphone and call it music. this is pretty much the story for slipknot. the only talent that slipknot really has is the ability to scream their lungs out without puking. the record companies that give deals to these terrible bands are missing the point of music. there are plenty of good not very well-known bands out there that deserve to be noticed. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! and before anybody tells me that i dont have to listen to them if i dont like them, im just giving people advice so f*ck off
1400049628|1.0|The book was amazingly lame, and boring. <br />I feel ripped off. Infact I have been! Take a look at all the reviews here. They are mostly 5 stars, and written with the same manner, tone, and style. Then there are a group of reviews(real ones) which take the complete opposite view (the book is terrible). The amount of these reviews are around the average amount that an unimportant book like this would receive. Obviously the author has just been compensating for his own incompetence by adding fake reviews.<br />In summary: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|this cd is easily godsmack's best. and what the hell was this sh*t about godsmack being nu-metal? crappy bands like linkin park belong in that category. some of the songs can be repetitive, but that doesnt make them bad. heres how i rate the songs:<br />straight out of line: 4/5: nice guitar work, but really gets stuck your head<BR>faceless: 3.5/5: alright but not one of the best songs<BR>changes: 4/5: lead singer sully really tests his range<BR>make me believe: 5/5: really good song, catchy chorus<BR>i stand alone: 5/5: nice song, they yell some, but it sounds good<BR>realign: 5/5: good song, not too hard on the ears, but still heavy<BR>i f*cking hate you 10/5!!!!!!!: awesome in-your-face song that is never tiresome<BR>releasing the demons: 5/5: pretty cool song, true godsmack<BR>dead and broken: 4/5: not quite as easy to get in to, still good<BR>i am: 5/5: one of my personal favorites, a little more deep.<BR>the awakening: ?: no singing, just some weird african stuff<BR>serenity: 4/5: not one of my favorites, dont really listen to it that much

B00013F38K|4.0|I have admired this show for a long time for its thought-provoking philosophy and dialogue, interesting and endearing characters, and action-packed episodes with a moral.  When I learned that the complete first season was to be made available on DVD, I pre-ordered it right away...with some concern that the widescreen format would not preserve what was originally broadcast.<br />My concern was well-founded:  what is offered here is a &quot;matted&quot; widescreen format that trims the top and bottom portions of the full-screen version.  Although care appears to have been taken to make this look natural, if you compare this version to the full-screen version, you notice things like Caine's hat missing its top.  I haven't had time to view the entire set--I just received it today--but I thought customers should know that what they will be buying will be a cropped version of Kung Fu.  <br />At the present time, the only version I see offered here is this widescreen version.  If this is all that will be made available, then I still recommend buying this set, because the show is incredible, and this is the first time some of these episodes have ever been offered on video (VHS or DVD).  Most of the action occurred center-screen (not at the very top or bottom--sometimes those areas were important, though, during fight sequences), so the cropped picture should not detract too much from the viewing experience...I'll know more later when I have viewed the whole set.  However, if a full-screen version becomes available, that's the one you should buy.  Overall opinion:  5 stars for the show, 3 stars for cropping it, so 4 stars overall.
B0000AI44Q|1.0|If you go to a concert misnamed &quot;Neil Young and Crazy Horse&quot; expect to hear every last cut from this dreary, banal, droning and relentlessly painful exercise in self-indulgence.<BR>The only reason most (former) fans stayed at Radio City last night was the forlorn hope of hearing two or three songs from Neil's creative past.   Fat chance.  Concert goers streamed out the door when it became clear that Neil was determined to inflict every last measure of pain possible on his audience.  If, when the lights went on after the encore, the theatre was 1/3 full, I would be amazed.  Caveat emptor!

0064407667|5.0|I believe Snicket is indeed giving Rowling a run for her money! This book is truly the work of a highly intelligent and highly comical individual.  Far from being evil or dangerous for kids, the book is inventive engaging, and happens to be a real page turner.  The characters are far from flat and invoke sympathy or disgust.  The children are loveable, especially Sunny, the biting baby.  Sprinkled throughout the book are opportunities for children to not only witness an interesting story, but also opportunities to add new words to their vocabularies.  Add to this the fact that the book s are not overly dense and long and you have the receipe for the perfect children's book.  Important: This book can also be emjoyed immensely by adults.

0385504209|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is a polemic against Christianity in general and Roman Catholicism in particular. That said, and except for an annoying tendency to flip-flop between the odysseys of the Langdon/Neveu/Teabing characters on the one hand and the Bishop/Silas characters on the other, the pace of the action--the twists and turns-- leaves the reader breathless. Taken purely as a suspense novel, it's as good as it gets, and if Brown's subject matter had involved,say, a plot to defraud the Depository Bank of Zurich (an institution which plays a role in the plot)i.e. a variation of the traditional crime novel, this work would have rated five stars.<br />What a pity, then, that he chose instead to tilt at Christian windmills; in so doing, he simply subsitutes what he considers one myth (the divinity of Jesus Christ)for another (the &quot;eternal feminine&quot;--whatever that means, the Cult of Mary Magdalen,etc). Although it must be said in fairness that Brown does make reference to this very human cul-de-sac, his focus upon what he considers a male-dominated, testosterone-driven institution obsessed with retaining its power amounts to beating a dead horse. The &quot;power&quot; of The Church is yet another myth. Surely Brown should know that Christianity has been in headlong retreat at least since The Reformation (though some trace it even earlier, to William of Occam and the nominalist controversy).As to the accuracy and historicity of the facts marshalled in support of his worldview, I have my own ideas but will pass in silence except say that Brown knows nothing of the science of astronomy. At the end of the novel, he writes &quot;...but to the east, a single point of light glowed brighter than any other....It was Venus&quot;.<br />On second thought,one need not be an astonomer to know that Venus first appears in the WEST!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie was so so so sad! I cried so much! everyone who has seen it cried, and they know it's true! Great movie, too.
B00018D44U|4.0|I pointed out in one of my guides last year that I was wondering where Norah Jones went, because she was quiet pretty much all the way through 2003. Well, my question was answered as soon as I saw the video for \\"Sunrise\\" in late January on VH1. I had been waiting for Norah to come back, and she did that and then some with her sophomore album Feels Like Home.<br />If there are any songs that are better than the rest, they would have to be -- well, actually, it's hard to say any one song on here is better than another, but I'm gonna have to go with \\"What Am I to You\\", \\"Those Sweet Words\\", and the spiritual \\"Humble Me\\". And as usual, there are a few remakes on here, like Townes Van Zandt's \\"Be Here to Love Me\\", as well as \\"The Long Way Home\\"; the latter was originally done a few years ago by Tom Waits on the Big Bad Love soundtrack (although I never heard of that movie or any of the other artists featured on that soundtrack, either, but maybe that's just me).<br />Another interesting thing about this album is that Norah is now expanding her vocal abilities. She doesn't try to hit any really high notes or anything, but you'll understand what I mean when you listen to songs like \\"Toes\\" and the aforementioned \\"What Am I to You\\".<br />I gave this album four stars for one reason and one reason only: it is very hard to measure up to Come Away With Me. But that aspect doesn't take away any of the greatness of this album. Feels Like Home is right at home in my collection.<br />Anthony Rupert

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Ever tasted caviare? To some people it's one of the best tastes in the world. To others it's just a mouthful of fishy stuff. And it doesn't matter how good or bad the caviare is, it's still always going to be - to them - a mouthful of fishy stuff. How do you know whether you like it? You try it.<br />To those not knowing whether to jump in and try &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; I say look at the five star reviews here, many of them long and in depth, and compare them with the superficiality of the &quot;Duh, it's boring&quot; statements. The only way you will know is by trying it for yourself. <br />No, it isn't a riotous bring down the house comedy. Nor was it meant to be. Nor, as far as I know, did it ever pretend to be. What it is is a soulful examination of ships that do a little more than pass in the night.<br />Hollywood screenwriters like to talk about story based movies, and character based movies. This is a character based movie. No diamonds get stolen. No serial killer walks the streets. Nobody is desperate to lose their virginity in wacky and funny ways. There isn't a car chase. And no asteroid hits the planet.<br />If you can stand all those negatives and settle for a loving look at human beings lost in their lives and in a city and culture that's alien to them, you can love &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; and love it a lot. When fewer things happen you look at the details, and that's what Sofia Coppola asks you to do. And to the person who said it had no soundtrack, it has one of the best soundtracks in recent years. The music by Kevin Shields, Air and others is perfect and worth buying in its own right.
B00005M989|4.0|Prince is the king of pop. He saved music in the 80's. That is all I have to say, buy the CD, or download it. I really reccomend it. Prince is a little strange, with those ass-less pants, but all in all, his music is good.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|...if you're dumb as a rock. <br />Otherwise don't hesitate for a second. It's a long time since we've seen a good movie about real relationships and that's exactly what this is.<br />Coppola is a terrific filmmaker. Johansson and Murray are superb. And a lot of credit should go to cameraman Link Accord who uses low depth of field to isolate the characters and still keep Tokyo glittering in the background.
0739313118|3.0|Although I couldn't put the book down till I'd finished it, I can't quite say that it was all that great. For starters, there's just so many ideas which have blatantly been ripped out of Foucault's Pendulum (and some Baudolino) - the paris museum, templar knights, hidden secret which everyone's searching for... Seems to be somewhat of a toned down Eco for the intellectual proletariat!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Capt. Woodrow F. Call and Capt. Augustus McRae play a thrilling role in the lives of 2 Former Texas Rangers gone cattlemen. They embark on a series of adventures as they set out from the deep southern tip of the United States, Lonesome Dove, Texas, and head towards a new land of oppurtunity and fertile soil. Capt. Call's hardwork and determination make him a blue collar hero as his partner McRae delivers an explosive punch to the big screen in portraying the cowboy we all want to be. With savvy looks, charm, hospitable manners, and a rough country slang, Capt. McRae is definetly every cowgirls dream. As he tags alongside his lifelong friend Woodraw, they roam the great frontier in search of Montana to settle for a new life of ranching. There are many setbacks in their trip including horse thiefs, Indians, and Arkansas lawmen who stand in thier way. It is a story of heartache, love, compassion, and 2 mens way of life that set this movie apart and in my mind make it the best western ever made. This is the only movie that ever brought tears to my eyes. Although an older movie, I am sure an avid western film watcher like myself will not be dissapointed. After all....the older the violin...the sweeter the music. *****
B00018D44U|5.0|For all those &quot;silly reviewers&quot; out there talking mess about Norah. Try looking at the Top 200 Billboard list, and you will see who's the best singer out there! Norah has remained #1 for the last five weeks. So stop writing all those crazy comments about her new CD. Have you listened to it? NO! You're just mad because your favorite singer isn't as hot as Norah. <br />Norah Jones is the best singer to come along in many years. There is NO ONE out there that can touch her!<br />So STOP with all the &quot;cheap&quot; talk!! <br />Norah is #1, it's the facts to face and deal with!
B00004ZAV3|4.0|We need another 27 songs to complete the picture a little better. #1s was a huge hit with a younger generation, so I put together a supplemental compilation of 27 more songs that would likely connect with the same audience. I didn't want to completely overlap the existing 3 compilations from the 70s:  62-66, 67-70 and Rock &amp; Roll Music - which was mostly covers (although McCartney's I Saw Her Standing There ranks with the best of any cover they did). I wanted to instead add some songs that have since become cultural icons like Blackbird, Here There &amp; Everywhere, Birthday, Getting Better and of course the poignant Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End. Pearl Jam did cover I Got A Feeling, but had a bigger hit with Hide Your Love Away from the I Am Sam soundtrack. I also wanted to add at least 3 George tracks. Of course there are omissions, but I restricted myself to the same 27 slots. (Plus, I didn't want to add too many songs from one album. In fact, All My Loving is the only track on either compilation that is from With The Beatles.)  Coincidentally, #1s had 11 songs from 1967 to 1970, and mine has 11 from 1962 to 1966. A nice balance:<BR>1. I Saw Her Standing There<BR>2. Please Please Me<BR>3. All My Loving<BR>4. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away<BR>5. Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)<BR>6. Nowhere Man<BR>7.

B0001HAISG|4.0|This faithful, richly lavish adaptation of J.M. Barrie's classic novel takes on the premise with a more dark and haunting side, as it follows the journey from Edwardian London to Neverland where an on-going war with  Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs, doubling as Mr. Darling) is taking place, along with some bloodthirsty pirates, eerie mermaids, and a clock-ticking crocodile.  It also adds a rich romance between Peter (Jeremy Sumpter) and Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood), which really makes this version a big exception.<br />The film's opening scenes are definitely intriguing and powerful, as the narrator (the honey-voiced Saffron Burrows) introduces us into the story, with fine sights of an Edwardian London neighborhood with a colorful blue-purple-orange-pink starry night sky above it, the Darling house, the nursery where Wendy and her brothers John and Michael (Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell, who are terrific) have their pretend swordfights, the parents Mr. and Mrs. Darling (the lovely, talented Olivia Williams), the nurse dog Nana, Wendy's school, a newly added character Aunt Millicent (Lynn Redgrave) who appraises Wendy for future marriage, and the bank where Mr. Darling works.  But things tend to really bog down when Sumpter--who looks the part but should have shown more emotion in his performance--arrives at the nursery window, with the help of unnecessary, cheap humor touches (particularly the annoying obnoxiousness of Tink, well played by Ludivine Sagnier) often marring the film's compelling enchantment from there to the end.  However, Isaacs shines in his double role of the murderously menacing Captain Hook and the stern father Mr. Darling, and newcomer Hurd-Wood is a treat to watch as a touchingly angelic Wendy Darling, and their effective performances help hold it all together, making it all the more worthwhile and enjoyable.  Excellent special effects, absorbing music score by five-time Oscar nominee James Newton Howard, and authentically gorgeous Neverland sets are total knockouts.  Not to mention, the Lost Boys are the best to date here, as is Smee, played with wonderful humor by Richard Briers.  Most enchanting sequence: Peter and Wendy having a dance by fairy light.
0634022296|1.0|On its website, Hal Leonard shows that this book contains piano notes as well as those for guitar and vocal, with a picture showing what its content should be like. Yet in reality, there is no piano notes at all! They simply decievied customers into buying their books, and they are unwilling to apologize! Until now, that mistake still exists in their website. They argued that this book is a &quot;fake&quot; book that can be used for piano. What an incredible excuse! Shameless enough. I wonder why such a lousy company can exist till now.
0385504209|3.0|This book is an adequate thriller complete with a hero and heroine in peril, racing against the clock, a series of secret plots/societies in the background. What Dan Brown has done differently here is to use religious history and religious organizations as the background for his yarn (as opposed to some secret government or mafia group). This makes his work different and somewhat refreshing. There are some minor shortcomings in the plot and a bit in the pacing (he overdoes historical tie-ins at times). Overall, it was a fun read. If you read thrillers, it is probably worth your time as you will certainly here it discussed.<br />  That brings me to a second point. It is a work of fiction and even though well researched, the research is used to create a fictional background for this tale. If this makes the average reader curious to look into the background all well and good. However, Mr Brown's fiction and fictionization of historical details should not be taken as facts.
B00007JVBI|4.0|Folky good, I've got this in a nice low key playlist with some Ani Defranco, Sun Kil Moon / Mark K. and simialr. Most are easy on the ears folk stylings focusing on Chans vocals, there are a few stand out tracks that break the cycle. &quot;Shaking Paper&quot; is one of those, and its an increadible track, from the opening drone feedback of guitar and entrancing drums with vocals to match all the way through.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|A great example of how the second movie can make money without being so hot.<br />You have good actors trying their best but they can't raise this picture beyond a B movie let alone come close to the first one.<br />Smith is funny but not believable, I think they could played te love interest angle different but that's not his fault. Jones overplays the lost agent, Tony Shaloub is a bright spot in the cast and Rip Torn delivers.<br />The over use of Frank the dog didn't help (he's no K-9) and the worms got old real fast.<br />Its also not clear when he K remembers the solution. That hurt too.<br />Rent this one and buy the first picture
1401300901|5.0|This book so captured my emotions that I didn't want it to end.  What she wrote about the main character losing her husband is exactly what I will go through if and when that ever happens to me.<BR>For a first time novelist she hit it out of the park.<BR>I can't recommend to everyone I know because of the swearing (I know I run in very traditional circles) but to those who can handle it this is a must read.
B00000J2PH|5.0|This was a beautiful album when I first heard it in 1971. It is a beautiful CD when I listen to it today.  Tapestry marked Carole King's transition from remarkable &quot;Tin-Pan Alley' pop song-writer for the likes of Neil Sedaka, the Shirelles (who I think originally recorded Will You Love Me Tomorrow) and others to a singer/performer of the first rank. The album exploded in 1971, no small feat when you consider that 1971 may have seen the culmination in the evolution of the album from a compilation of inidvidual hits into a set-piece that was best served whole. The evolution began with Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds and went on from there.  The growth of FM radio was fueled in part by the ability of those stations to play entire albums at a time.  Similarly, the fact that FM stations would play whole sides of album encouraged musicians to create albums that were more than just a series of unrelated songs. But I digress . . .<br />There is a two-fold beauty gained from listening to Tapestry today. The first is the nostalgic pleasure gained from listening again to beautiful words set perfectly to music.  This pleasure is probably limited to those of us, of a certain age, who cut their musical teeth on the music of the 60s and early 70s.  The second is the pleasure anyone, no matter their age, can get from listening to the combination of lyrics and music that is Tapestry.  <br />If the definition of a classic is a piece of work that survives and propsers over time, then Tapestry is a classic.
0064471837|5.0|A delightful series that will keep you in action from the first page to the last.  (And first book to the last book)  I felt like I was watching some type of movie when reading it.  The world is in danger as evil nacromancers use their own bell powers to bring back the Greater Dead (those who do not pass the 'official' gate).  It's up to the Abhorsen's job to see that these nacromancers are to be stopped and the Dead to return to the \\"river\\" in peace.  Thus, the Abhorsen destined to do so would be Sabriel.  Along the way, she meets up with unusual friends and vicious foes as the fight against the enemy isn't that easy as simply waving a bell.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I recently bought 'Feels Like Home' and 'Come Away with Me', and my question is, what's all the hype about?  I think the arrangements are nice, and both albums set a mood, but they're sterile.  I can't engage with the songs or the singer.  There's nothing wrong with either, per se, but I just can't get involved.  As I said in my other review, I also bought 'I Can;t Be New' by an artist called Susan Werner after listening to it on Amazon.  The difference is amazing, and Susan is nowhere near the name that Norah is.  I'd recommend her album for someone looking for something jazzy, relaxing, fun and intelligent too.  Norah does take a good picture though.
B00006BTCA|3.0|Ah, this album sounds like bygone youth. At least that's what I think whenever I hear it. I takes me back to the sounds of the mid eighties and its cornucopia of wave bands, infusing in me those memories of hyper serious teen confusion, sorrow and ecstasy. The lyrics attempt to convey a emotional legitimacy that I just can't seem to buy into. Their sound is definitely complex and refreshing, even if it is a mash up of once cool 80's formulae.  By most accounts, one of the best albums of its year... for me, its good, but not not my favorite by far. In my play lists as a nice mix with Radiohead, Constantines, Hot Hot Heat, Psychadelic Furs, The Church, and Echo and the Bunnymen. This display of talent has me hoping that the brightest lights are yet to be turned on.
B000002U8G|5.0|This is one of the more consistently pleasant Floyd efforts, making it one of the band's, dare I say it, happiest LP's. The album kicks off with one of the hardest-rocking numbers in the band's catalog, &quot;One of These Days&quot;, which has a mind-numbingly cool delayed-bass solo, which isn't all too surprising in context since the entire song is driven by charging double-tracked bass and motorcycle-revving guitar. It also has Nick Mason's only lead vocal ever, with the single vocal tape sample of the sentence, &quot;One of these days I'm gonna cut you into little pieces&quot;. Next comes &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot;, an impossibly delicate acoustic song that actually shares a couple of things with &quot;One of These Days&quot;: double-tracked bass, trebly organ, and intro blowing winds. This one, though, features a soft David Gilmour vocal and lots of fragile guitars without any attack at all. After that beautiful song, we get a folkish-rock song, again without much of any attack at all, titled &quot;Fearless&quot;. This one has more propulsion than &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot;, due to Nick Mason's gentle drumming and Rick Wright's knolling piano at the end. &quot;San Tropez&quot; shows Floyd branching out into loungey music and having a lot of fun with it (definitely tongue-in-cheek). I've heard this one compared to Jimmy Buffett before, but (rest assured) it's really not like that at all. Waters' sole lead vocal on the record (all the rest are handled by Gilmour) is breathy, but not fake-breathy like John Mayer, and Gilmour has a Hawaiian-influenced slide solo. Rick Wright handles the outro piano solo. &quot;Seamus&quot; is one of the most atypical songs in the band's roster. It's a twelve-bar blues sung by Gilmour and Steve Marriott's dog. During the song, you can hear a harmonica in the background (possibly played by Mason), another dog barking in another studio, and someone saying midway through that &quot;the dog has got to go&quot;. &quot;Echoes&quot; closes and has the distinction of being one of the most worshipped epics that Floyd ever recorded. I can't exactly see why at times, since my top three votes for best Floyd epics go to every one on &quot;Animals&quot;, but I do love it. The &quot;funky&quot; section is very well done, and so is the &quot;whale-chant and feedback guitar&quot; section. Wright's Leslied piano is also unique. Overall, one of my favorite Floyd LP's.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Bublé is 'Primo', as in #1. Incredible voice, incredible singer (and incredibly handsome)<br />To Maybelle &amp; Takita for turning me onto 'Bublé music' thanks!<br />The world needs more Bublé.
B00005JN1L|5.0|I watch movies all the time. I've been watching and studying them for years. People these days just can't seem to make good films like the good old days. But this is a good film. One of the best new movies I've seen in a long time. It kept me on the edge of my seat and the ending was great. But the whole movie was great. There probably wouldn't be a Secret Window if it wasn't for Johnny Depp. He is the perfect guy for this film and I can't imagine any other actor taking his role. Overall, this was a good, entertaining film and was very thrilling and suspensful. If you want to go out and see a good movie, go and see this.
B0001932ZA|1.0|I purchased the Special Edition DVD precisely because I wanted a clean widescreen version of the Running Man for my movie collection.<BR>Imagine my disappointment when playing the Widescreen DVD and seeing the full screen version.

I'll be returning this DVD for a refund.
B00018D44U|3.0|I've also recently purchased Norah's first album, and feel that while the arrangements and instrumentals are beautiful,both albums are just too precise, too measured, and therefore somewhat sterile.  I saw Norah Jones in concert, and the same was true of her live set.  It's almost like she's afraid to make a mistake, so she doesn't allow herself to be really brilliant.  I think she has talent --- but perhaps she needs more time to grow into her ability.<br />When I bought 'Feels like Home', I also bought the new one by Susan Werner (I Can't Be New), and in terms of this type of music, I really like it a lot better.  Surprising, because Norah is a big name, and Susan really isn't.  I'd say skip Norah, check out Susan Werner, and get more sultry vocals, jazzy arrangements and amazing writing for your amazon dollar.<br />I'm a big fan of good songwriting, and unfortunately for Norah, I have to look elsewhere.<br />Norah does have a great voice  though.
B000005JA8|1.0|There have been several reviews that say it better than I could.  I'll just quote one: &quot;for pretentious pseudo-intellectuals who need a life.&quot;  I'm just adding my review to bring the rating back down where it belongs.
0446677450|5.0|Rather than rehash that which has been said in the previous positive reviews, let me just say that this truly is a perspective and life changing book. I would have preferred to read it without the storyline, but I think it helps bring home points and makes it more memorable. It also makes it an easy read for the general public. <br />Overall, The best motivational and financial self help guide book around!
B00005614M|5.0|This cd is one of the COOLEST jams around this is the kind of music everyone should listen to.I love this cd.Miles Davis is the coolest cat ever.GO BUY THIS CD TODAY!!!
B000003S2K|5.0|Nearly everyone who uses a computer is familiar with at least one piece of Eno's work; he wrote the little 3 second Windows booting-up music for Microsoft.<br />This album is a perpetual favorite, one of the New Age genre classics and has held up well over the years, despite many new and wonderful innovative composers in the ambient realm. I still enjoy \\"Music for Airports\\" and it's a go-to album for destressing after work.<br /><br />The album is divided into 4 sections (\\"1/1,\\" \\"2/1,\\" \\"1/2,\\" and \\"2/2\\"), and it soothes the listener with repetitive piano and synthesizer motifs, and adds the color of chimes and vocals. This is the \\"ambient\\" music style, something to play while you need to concentrate, perhaps, or to relax or go to sleep by. I can also recommend the newer \\"Glitters is Gold\\" which also has non-linear music of this type.
B000059ZLH|2.0|I will not say anything about the band's performance, I've seen them live and they are always great however this DVD has a terrible sound mixing and also the master's volume is too low. <BR>Anyway, I think this DVD still a must have for DT fans.<br />Maybe we could watch the DVD with no volume and use the Scenes from a Memory CD to compensate the sound.
B0000039QA|1.0|Fooled you with the title and rating, did'nt I? This is one of the best albums in hip-hop,and definetly one of my favorite albums in general. Cop this (meaning GET it) along with:<br />Project: Funk Da World, Craig Mack<BR>Coral Fang, Distillers<BR>Illmatic, Nas<BR>All Eyez On Me, 2Pac<BR>Master of Puppets, Metallica<BR>and to conclude this, Get Rich Or Die Tryin' 50 Cent
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The quote above was said by Agent Smith at the final confrontation between Neo and Agent Smith. This movie was okay, the beginning was cool where Morpheus and Trinity are searching for Neo who is trapped between the Real World and The Matrix. In the Real World he's sleeping on a hospital bed aboard the Hemmer (at the end of Reloaded the Neb. is destroyed and Morpheus and crew were forced to join another ship). Of corse you've gotta have the ... half-hour long fight scene, I'm getting TIRED of it !! Most of the action takes place in the Real World (which is no where nearly as cool as The Matrix). Probably not worth the ... getting into it, if you can wait and see it for half the price at the second runs theater.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|&quot;Rain Man&quot; is one of those rare films that is equally touching and moving as it is humorous.  A true labor of love for those involved, particularly its producers, director Barry Levinson, and star Dustin Hoffman, it remains an undated and compelling work, since its release sixteen years ago.  By now most know that Hoffman was heavily praised for his dead-on portrayal of an autistic savant, winning an Oscar in the process.  However, it is really Tom Cruise who is the heart and soul of the movie, portraying its true protagonist.  His is a very underrated performance, one that reminds how accomplished an actor he can be when given the right dramatic role.  Equally good is Levinson's direction, smartly exposing the humor on what could normally be viewed as overly sentimental material.  Included is one brief and all to basic featurette with cast and crew interviews of the time.  The one deleted scene featured is redundant of what's already in the movie.  The DVD makes up for all of this however with the inclusion of three audio commentaries to choose from.  In the end, the greatest strength of this package is the movie itself.  Whether it was indeed the best film of 1988 is a point of debate.  Nonetheless, it is likely to satisfy most viewers because its themes of greed, discovery and compassion are not only universal, but in this case, intelligently presented.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|This movie was so bad i think it gave me cancer. I had high hopes but I was just let down. The vampires were too weak they had no powers at all its more like a bunch of english people fighting werewolves. Special effects is all this movie had. I guess there was so much of that they didnt have time for a plot or character development it only has one star because of the back story. I didnt rent or buy it i borrowed it from a friend but i think im gonna charge him for wasting my time. This makes a Jhon Grisham book sound good.
B0000028M7|5.0|The one-star reviews for \\"Dirt\\" are so utterly laughable that one has to ask \\"Are these people for real?\\" Especially is the case with the person calling theirself \\"Fred Durst's Number One Fan.\\" For one thing, Alice In Chains were around way before Puddle of Mudd, Godsmack or any of those other copycat bands even existed. Another thing, I had never thought of Layne Staley's voice ever resembling Cornholio/Beavis or someone who had smashed their finger in a car door, and Layne also did play an instrument (guitar) and also wrote plenty of songs...he and Jerry Cantrell were the creative force behind the band...also, it's the band Godsmack who took the name from Alice In Chains' song, not the other way around. Any way you slice it, this album is a masterpiece.
B00005JLTN|5.0|This movie was like two hours fifteen minutes. They couldh've made it 20 minutes shorter if that fight with the about500 Agent Smiths had been cut down. Also I didn't quite understand the plot(if there was one ):. The plot as I know it is Neo is beginning to understand his powers and his relationship with Trinity is growing (as there is a 20 minute long sex/dancing scene). The good news is it didn't seem like such a computer geek's movie, most of the stunts were real (like the super cool freeway chase). Also many more characters were introduced, the story didn't just center around the Nebachanezzar (I think I spelled that correctly). The super-villian Agent Smith has gotten a lot more mad at Neo and there are several confrentations. Overall a super-cool movie with cool characters and special effects!
0790729970|5.0|jim carrey is one of my fave actors. he is soooo funny in this movie. it's great for family u'll definitely enjoy it!
B000089RVX|3.0|Despite the complaints that Evanescence has brought the much-loved underground goth scene to radio and MTV (which i agree with to an extent), this is not bad music.  I think this kind of music is also a little too sugary for most goth fans, but for those who enjoy jumping on the popular bandwagons of the 21st century, this would definately not be a bad buy.  <br />However, for those mainstreamers who enjoy this cd, and want a more realistic taste of true goth-metal, i suggest you check out the vast quantity that amazon has to offer (try Tristania)
B000002IOW|5.0|Presto is without a doubt the most underrated album in the Rush canon.  It's also the most heartachingly beautiful music the band has ever created.  In fact, the only thing keeping Presto from being my favorite Rush album is the thin, un-textured quality of the recording and production.  It's very noticeable the first couple of times you listen to the album, but you'll forget it very soon, trust me.  Presto is that good.<br />In 1989, Rush was moving away from the synthesizer-dominated sound they had displayed on their previous few albums, which came to a peak with their previous effort, 1987's disappointing Hold Your Fire.  There are plenty of keyboards on Presto as well, but it sounds much more organic and human, and Geddy Lee uses a lot of piano as well, to great effect.<br />Presto was in fact the very last album in their back catalogue I got when I first became a Rush fan, mostly because I was underwhelmed by \\"Show Don't Tell,\\" which is the only song from the album I had heard at the time (it's on the Chronicles collection as well as the Different Stages live album).  I still don't care much for the song, but fortunately, it's the only weak spot on the album (not a good thing, considering it's the opening track and first single!).  \\"Chain Lightning\\" is an upbeat, super-fun song with a great Alex Lifeson guitar riff.  Apparently, the song uses the weather as a metaphor for human relations (only Rush...).  The title track is quite possibly the most emotional, passionate song by Rush.  Geddy Lee just sounds so sincere and lonely in his vocal delivery.  \\"Available Light\\" and \\"Red Tide\\" are both beautiful, piano-based songs, with the latter having one of the few up-front synthesizer moments on the album.  \\"Superconductor\\" (or is that \\"Sleep With The Doctor?\\") rocks hard, while \\"Scars\\" has a very funky feel (you have *got* to hear the live version of this song on a bootleg, it's incredible).<br />And of course, there's \\"The Pass,\\" one of my three or four favorite Rush songs.  It's a heart-wrenching plea against suicide, with some of the most passionate lyrics ever written by Neil Peart.  Musically, it's rather unassuming for a Rush song, with only a simple bassline and drumbeat with subtle acoustic and electric guitar flourishes (Okay, there's a fist-pumping guitar solo in there, too).  Now, I'm normally a rather stoic, unemotional person as far as my outward persona goes, but when I saw Rush play this song live on their 2002 tour, I got tears in my eyes (and it's a good bet some other audience members did as well).  \\"The Pass\\" is purely magical.<br />So is Presto.  Like I said, get past the flat recording quality, and you've got an unforgettable Rush experience.  They've yet to equal it (2002's Vapor Trails came very, very close, though).  It seems like a rather overlooked album, and that's a really bad thing.  Pick up Presto now, you won't be disappointed.Rush songs.

B000000JO3|5.0|I first heard Minor Threat's Out of Step cassette when I was 13, that was 10 years ago and I still love them.  The moment I heard them my life changed, I instantly went from liking crap to wanting to hear any early Dischord release I could get my hands on.  Whether or not Minor Threat started straight-edge, (I do believe Ted Nugent was &quot;straight-edge&quot;) what makes them different is that they don't tell you to be sxe 30 times a song like other sxe bands.  Anyways, this group made me start a hc/punk band which led to many friendships and great times so listen the music, find more of the same, start a band a have fun!
B000002NJS|3.0|This is just an over-hyped album! It might be the best one from madonna's repertoire but if you really wanna hear REAL electronic music go check out Xenakis, muslimgauze, and even diamanda galas' schrei X album.<br />This is just pop electronic.
B000089RVX|3.0|I guess the best thing I can say about Evanescence is that they're good enough to not have to rely on the fact they're fronted by an attractive female (that probably won't stop them though, will it?).<br />Fallen is one of the very few mainstream albums I've ever bought without caring much for what I'd heard of it on the radio.  \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" \\"Going Under,\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" didn't really do it for me, but I was very intrigued by Amy Lee's beautiful voice, their liberal use of piano, and the fact that they seem to be pretty good songwriters, something that's not commonplace in today's rock music market.<br />For the most part, it was a risk that paid off for me.  It's not as if Evanescence doesn't fit into the current crop of faceless modern rock bands, it's just that they're probably the best of the bunch.  And yes, they are good songwriters, even though the guitars are a bit too crunchy at times and Amy Lee's lyrics sometimes seem like they were written by that depressed girl that sat behind me in my 11th grade creative writing class (\\"I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal...\\" Hoo-boy.).<br />In fact, I should mention that there are no mediocre tracks on Fallen, the only exception being the gag-me-with-a-violin-string album version of \\"My Immortal,\\" which is *way* to cheesy for me to take seriously (thankfully, the more enjoyable radio version appears as the unlisted 12th track).  But there's not really any song on here that I can classify as being better than \\"pretty good,\\" either.  I guess the best song on the album would have to be \\"Everybody's Fool,\\" which has a great melody (I don't know if it's a good thing that they just released this song as a single or not).  I've also grown to like \\"Going Under,\\" as well as their breakthrough song \\"Bring Me To Life\\" (despite the bordering-on-hilarious guest appearance of What's His Name from That One Band).  \\"Whisper,\\" which sounds like a good Dream Theater song (a phrase I would've previously thought to be an oxymoron), is heavy and haunting, and even the melodramatic chanting that closes the track (and album proper) doesn't bring it down.<br />It occurs to me now that I've said a lot of not-so-kind things about this album, and only given it backhanded compliments.  I don't want to give the wrong impression- Fallen is indeed a good rock album.  Will the next release by Evanescence be as good or better, or will they just peter out creatively and commercially?  Only time will tell, but I'll be rooting for them.ymoron), is heavy and haunting, and even the melodramatic chanting that closes the track (and album proper) doesn't bring it down.<br />It occurs to me now that I've said a lot of not-so-kind things about this album, and only given it backhanded compliments.

B000127LW2|5.0|As a first time viewer of Star Trek Voyager, I am hooked.<BR>The shows are so interesting.  I just love the way the Captain Janeway character handles her crew - she comes across as a very strong leader.  Her character is inspirational for all females.<BR>We need more shows like Voyager that depict women that are not only beautiful but are also very intelligent.  Yes, women can be beautiful and very smart too.  Kudos to the writers of the Star Trek Voyager series.
B000002UC5|5.0|This is up there with the Beach Boys' Friends album for casual brilliance.  Yes it's not labored over its relaxed and relatively low-fi/off the cuff and its more unselfconsciously experimental than any thing Paul would do subsequently, and all the better for it.  It really stands up and anticipates many of the trends in music of the last 20 years or so.  Favorite tracks: Junk &amp; Singalong Junk, Every Night, Hot as Sun/Glasses, and Valentine Day.  Maybe if he hadn't gotten slammed so hard for it he wouldn't have run out of gas so quickly and straight into schmaltz.  Though Ram and the first Wings album rate as well.
B00004BZ0N|4.0|a work of triumphant genius. i would recommend this tune-packed double album to literally anyone who enjoys any type of music. the title track sets the bar for a record bursting at the seems with instantly accessable songs. trying (but not too hard) to steer clear of one formula, strummer and the lads display their songwriting talents with an aray of differing styles. if you havent got any clash in your collection you should buy this album, if you have... this is better.
B000002UAU|5.0|To the reviever who said this album was so bad Capitol didn't release any singles off it, can i just say that's because this was an identical release to the UK. On most of their eariler albums in the US Capitol mixed UK album cuts with singles to make more albums (and more money). In Britain, nearly all The Beatles albums had no singles on.<BR>That aside, This a great album and once you have heard the likes of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, &quot;A hard Day's night&quot; and &quot;Please Please me&quot; you will enjoy this gem from the musical geninues called &quot;The Beatles&quot;.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|What can I say about this movie ? It was beyond my expectations. Such warm and genial romantical story. It's simply brilliant !
B00005JM02|5.0|I know there must be about 1,000 reviews on this movie already, but I just had to get my say in here. Finding Nemo is an absolutely tremendous movie! It is way too fantastic! My whole family is in love with it.<br />Finding Nemo is about a young clown fish Nemo and his father Marlin. Take that Nemo is the only surviving fish from a barracuda attack that ate the rest of the eggs and his mother and damaged his fin, and add to that that Marlin is very overly protective of Nemo, and you spell TROUBLE.<br />Things take a turn for the worst when Nemo is taken by a scuba diver when he was deliberately disobeying his father because he was tired of being over protected, and is taken to a dentist's aquarium in Sydney, Australia.<br />Marlin is distraught at the loss of his son, and with his new friend, the Absent Minded Dory, battle the entire ocean to find Nemo. Along the way they encounter sharks, jellyfish, surfer turtles, and whales, and many more interesting creatures.<br />Marlin eventually finds Nemo, and they live happily ever after.<br />My family loves this movie so much. It's so funny, and the dialogue is free from dirty language, which my dad appreciates very much.<br />My friend's mom used to be a dental assistance, and when we showed her the scenes of the dentist in Sydney, she laughed. That shows that this film was researched very well.<br />The DVD has a ton of extras, including a documentary, commentary, and a lot of Easter eggs. One of them is an advertisement for the Aqua Scum 2003, which is very funny. I won't tell you where it is, though. You'll have to find that for yourself. &#61514;<br />I know some people say that this movie is awful, terrible, no good, very bad, and all the rest, but I think this movie is wonderful. My advice is to watch it for yourself, then rate it. It won't do you any good to base your opinion on other peoples reviews, even my own. Watch it for yourself, then write a review and let everyone know what you think. I promise you, you won't regret it.ou won't regret it.
0066620996|5.0|For years, in fact perhaps decades, men with their Gillette razors have been shaving towards the grain, and in the same up-down motion. But with the advent of the Mach3, we can now shave against the grain, for a smoother, cleaner shave. Equally important, with this book, men and women everywhere can quickly dispel the ever present myths which advocate a management view of &quot;the next big thing&quot; , technological innovation, or radical corporate fads.<br />Good to Great, isn't about any of those things. It's a plain look at what makes companies transform from mediocre to greatness. Collins and his team argue that good is the enemy of great and the path to great is one which involves no gimmicks, fads or radical changes. Their findings are those of common sense. Great management, great processes, and great products create great companies. <br />Unlike the follow the grain tendencies of the last 20 years, Collins and his team argue that one must shave against the grain and against the buildup of mediocrity to achieve greatness. They profile over a dozen companies that made this jump and they tell each and every one of us how to manage or create a similar jump. <br />Collins and his team are at their best when they take abstract ideas and show how companies like Nucor, Walgreens and Gillette apply those ideas to achieve greatness. A good read to contrast against the ideas of Collins is The Tipping Point by Malcom Gladwell. Good to Great is an essential read for anyone who is looking for a dummie's approach to duty and destiny.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Whilst not as comphensive as the two double albums (&quot;1962-1966&quot; and &quot;1967-70&quot;) this is perfect for music fans on a budget, who want to buy at least one Beatles CD for their collection.

0802136834|5.0|I cannot recommend this book strongly enough to anyone who's even slightly interested in the story of Henry VIII and his six wives.  This is a gorgeous, cohesive book, easy to read and full of historical detail that enriches the story rather than overwhelms it.  There were many times when I forgot I was reading non-fiction, the story was so cleanly presented.<br />This is a far cry from the dry, confusing history lessons I had in high school.  Weir makes these women (and the men around them) come back to life, warts and all.  Normally reading a book like this, I'd need a flow chart to keep track of all the dukes, duchesses, ladies, lords and scheming religious zealots, but I had no trouble at all remembering who was who, even during the period where every woman was apparently named Katherine, Anne or Elizabeth.  It was especially interesting to see how kind history has been to Anne Boleyn, a woman who may actually have been deserving of the executioner's axe.<br />My one miniscule gripe (not enough to drop my review from 5 stars) is that once in a while, Weir puts the story ahead of the timeline and will insert details out of sequence.  One example of that is that during a segment discussing the latter years of the marriage of Henry and Anne Boleyn, there's a short paragraph discussing a gift Anne gave to Henry early on in their relationship.  There really wasn't any reason why that tidbit couldn't have been presented chronologically; the only thing I could think of was that perhaps the author didn't want to interrupt the narrative about the acrimony between Anne and Katherine of Aragon by tossing in the bit about the gift. There are about a half dozen or so instances like this, and while they don't at all disturb the flow of the book, they struck me as a little annoying given the meticulous detail to the timeline in every other instance.<br />This is a truly masterful book; I plan on immediately purchasing Weir's other books in this genre.
B000002HH9|4.0|It tires me hearing/reading about how &quot;bad&quot; WMS is, it really does.  There must be some pretty lonely, depressed, down-an-out Cure fans out there who only want music in which to think about suicide to, it's pretty ridiculous.  Another thing... no one mentions the track &quot;Numb.&quot;  It's a great song, as is &quot;Jupiter Crash&quot; &quot;Want&quot; &quot;Bare&quot;, etc. al.  Just b/c WMS doesn't have the line &quot;Doesn't matter if we all die...&quot; or &quot;the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world&quot;, doesn't make it bad.  Please, grow up and bring your musical tastes with you.
B000002UAX|4.0|Probably the worst Beatles album, but needless to say it's still great. Contains both classic tracks and novelty songs.
B000001FRY|5.0|This record rocks. Mainly because Adam Clayton plays bass like Cliff Williams: that relentless dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh... keeps the album movin' ever forward. That's right, AC/DC!!!! Think I'm kiddin' ? Check it out! It's all over the place. Listen to the segue into \\"Out of Control\\" , the guy can hardly wait to start pluggin away! Ocassionally he'll start a song with some kinda riff, but by the end, it's back to dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh... again. It works! It rules! And it probably saved them a lotta money on studio tricks ' cause unlike later releases, this album is driven by U2's energy.<br />As far as them other 2'ers go: the drums sound smackin' and Lillywhitey. The Edge still has one. Bono's vocals are really good , especially 'cause they're mixed down with the rest of the music! He's merely started a landslide in his ego here, it hasn't yet blossomed into a full-on flag-wavin', marchin'-mullet-headed ego yet. And then there's the BELLS! No one is given credit for playing them. They just appear.....on almost every song. How cool. They give Boy a great starry-night-timey feel none of the other albums have.<br />I saw these dudes live around the time this album came out. They played at Randy's Rodeo in San Antonio , the place where the Pistols played. There were only about 200 people in the audience, but the band were in-flippin'-credible. They definitely had a certain something. Glad I caught'em when I did, 'cause I'm not too crazy about what they later became.More power to y'all who like the later stuff. Must be something there. But this is the one for me. I played it recently for a friend who thought U2 have always totally sucked & he had to admit.............
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I purchased Chariot because of &quot;Follow Through,&quot; a great sappy love song that is the first single off the album.  Most of the songs sounded like &quot;Follow Through,&quot; which makes it a great album, but the pop ballads do get tiring after a while.  &quot;Belief&quot; has some of my favorite lyrics in it, and &quot;Just Friends&quot; and &quot;Nice to Meet You Anyway&quot; are great songs as well.  &quot;Chemical Party&quot; is a fresh, funny song, and &quot;I Don't Wanna Be,&quot; the second single, while tiring after a few listens, is destined for pop success.  The song &quot;Chariot&quot; is great, but seems to blend in with the rest of the album, as does &quot;Overrated&quot;, &quot;Meaning&quot;, and &quot;Crush&quot;, the most forgettable songs on the album.  Although they all may sound similar, the sound is so great that most listeners will enjoy this &quot;Chariot&quot; ride the whole way through.
B00005JN1L|5.0|I really enjoyed Secret Window; it was extremely entertaining. The suspense was just right, it even added some humor from Johnny Depp into the mix, which will always make a movie great. The viewer is thrown head-first into the plot, so you can really get into the movie, and the ending has an interesting twist. I would recommend this movie to all.
B000002UAF|5.0|After the success of their first two albums &quot;Please Please me&quot; and &quot;With The Beatles&quot;(which topped charts all over the world), The Beatles made a film entiled &quot;A Hard Day's night&quot;. This is the soundtrack to that album and is their best album up to that point, repeating the global #1 success of their previous albums. The title cut is excellent and it is uphill from then on with great classics such as &quot;If I fell&quot;, &quot;Things we said today&quot;, etc. If you are one of those very rare people who have been on another musical planet and don't own any Beatles albums and are thinking of checking them out, the best place to start would be with this and the debut album &quot;Please Please me&quot;.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This two CD set is packed full of Metallica's greatest hits plus two new tunes.  But, there is a slight twist. The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra &quot;sits in&quot; with Michael Kamen at the helm.  I wouldn't consider S&amp;M as &quot;heavy&quot; as their previous albums, but I would consider it more fun to listen to all around. Encompassing the intuitive conductorship of Michael Kamen and Metallica's crunchy riffs into one great album, this is worth every penny.  Also, there is a S&amp;M DVD if you'd like to watch the action.
B000002B49|5.0|I am a big Deep Forest fan. Of all of their CDs, this and Music Detected are my favorites. Boheme has a gorgeous earthy sound that is equal parts sensual and comforting. This is one of my &quot;Rainy Day&quot; CDs - music to play when it is dark and stormy outside and all you want to do is read a good book and have some great coffee or tea. The individual songs combine to form a rich blend of foreign elements with familiar notes - Eastern European vocals, chants and instruments combined and enhanced with backbeats and synthisized instrumentation.<br />The sole exception to the calming air of this CD is Cafe Europa, which is a heavier song with a club feel. In classic Deep Forest tradition, this song incorporates chanting with synthesizers and a driving backbeat. The first song, Anasthasia, is deep and rich with industrial elements and an earthy feel of discovery - much like walking through a forest at night to discover a field of wildflowers at sunrise. Also full of of rich emotion and imagery is the three song arc - Bulgarian Melody, Deep Folk Song, and Freedom Cry. Bulgarian Melody starts as a seemingly unfocused piano piece featuring vocals by Marta Sebestyn (also featured on two other tracks on the CD, Marta's Song and Twosome). This builds in intensity and flows into Deep Folk Song, which is a triumphant piece incorporating echoing drums and native cries. This floats directly into Freedom Cry, a passionate, inspirational song which uses native vocals by Hungarian Gypsies. Marta's Song and Twosome are both showcases for Marta Sebestyn's incredible voice. She's like a foreign Karen Carpenter, able to use rich vocals to convey love, loss, regret, hope, and comfort all at once. Gathering and Lament both use synthisizers and native vocals to great effect, Lament as a song rich in loss and regret, Gathering as a song full of warning and portents. Katharina is the most sensual piece on the album, blending synthesized horns and pipes with a slower yet powerful backbeatand soft chanting for a ceremonial feel. Bohemian Ballet is an intense song, with an insistent backbeat, lilting guitars and raw, emotional vocals. The last piece, titled simply Boheme is a pleasant wrap up - you know it's the last piece even if you aren't keeping track. This upbeat song features synthesized horns and hopeful, expectant vocals combined with a backbeat that is not too fast, not too slow - just right. <br />This is an all-around gorgeous CD for anyone with an interest in atmospheric, global music that you don't get to hear on the radio. Because Deep Forest is so artistic, you may recognize pieces of this CD from fashion shows, commercials, television specials - anywhere but popular mainstream radio. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes New Age music with a twist of electronica. You won't regret this CD purchase. =)
B0001CCXY8|5.0|It's quite amazing how cc have evolved in their sound &amp; content specialy after 11 albums not counting the dvds... Cannibal corpse still manages to come up with their 12th most incredible deathmetal release and they haven't yet dissapointed me. Upon every cd they come out with it seems they only get better &amp; better. The only album that i didn't enjoy from cc has to be bloodthirst because i personally found the sound of that album &quot;bloodthirst&quot; to be kinda slow,not heavy, &amp;, very mediocre but 12 out of 1 isn't bad infact its amazing how flawless &amp; brutal cc still remains!Every one always mention Chris barnes but George &quot;corpsegrinder&quot; is doing a much better job if you ask me... Don't get me wrong cc back in the early 90's with Barne's vocals sounded amazing! I have much respect for Chris barnes &amp; i wish much luck with him &amp; whatever he is doing, but, sfu's sound cannot come close to cc's sound. The realy only good album sfu ever had was haunted but that's about it.Well,like i said... Cannibal corpse still manages to bring the deathmetal world an release which has  the most talent musicians &amp; the most brutal sound &amp; they will always remain the godfathers of this genre. Buy it!!
B00004BZ0N|1.0|Perhaps my musical standards are too high, but this such a dissapointing LP words can hardly describe my disgust. The title track is passable but the remainder is a jumbled,ametuerish mess!Joe Strummer and company were crude, sloppy, untalented 'musicians' who couldn't carry a tune with handles and their attempts at incorporating dance, jazz and reggae into this waste of disc space is laughable at best. Why this is heralded as one of the greatest rock/punk albums of all time is truly a mystery to me. I just wasn't impressed or moved at all. My favorite part of &quot;London Calling&quot;? Returning it to the music store for a refund. Don't believe the hype.
3596125723|5.0|Catch 22 is in brief, an execllent novel. It is painfully hilarious, and heartbreakingly sad, often at the same time. It tells the story of a bomber pilot in italy in the second world war, for whom the only way to stay sane in a war full of lunacy and madness is to go crazy. (read it and you'll see what i mean)<BR>A Superb Book
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I kept seeing the previews for this movie and kept on meaning to see it in the theatre. Then when it got Oscar attention I figured I would finally rent it. When I picked it up on the video store one of the customers warned me that he bought it and he hated it.  I figured it was just one person's opinion and plus I wasn't buying it.  Well, I hated it!  The only thing worth seeing on the DVD was the extra footage of the talk show.  This movie had no point and absolutely no plot.  It seems that the only thing the movie tried to do was show how 2 people of substantially different ages can have fun with each other and grow attached to each other without having sex.  I don't understand why this movie got so much acclaim during Oscar time.  I have only seen one other movie directed by Sofia Coppola which was \\"The Virgin Suicides.\\"  I felt that movie was a bit on the bizarre side...not your typical film but it kept me in the story, wanting to know what would happen next, and made me feel for the characters.  The only thing \\"Lost in Translation\\" did for me was to hope I could make it to the end of the movie without kicking myself too hard for not following that customer's advice!
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Underworld is the story of an age old war that's going on between vampires and werewolves. It stars Kate Beckinsale (who also starred in the awful Pearl Harbor) as Selene, a vampire that hunts werewolves. Things get complicated for Selene when she falls for a mortal(the really dull Scott Speadman) who helps her in the begining of the movie, when she starts to fall in love him. To make matters more complicated, he is also the chosen one by the werewolves(I hate when that happens)so they want him too. Selene's fellow vampires aren't too happy either. All they seem to do is sit around the vampire mansion brooding in there goth velvet gowns, while Selene is kicking werewolf(rear-end). I was amazed that Bauhaus wasn't being played over and over at the vampire mansion.<BR>Another thing you'll notice is the considerable amount of rain the city where this film is set in, is getting. They must have terrific drainage, is all I kept thinking. The movie does have some fun fight scenes, I only wish they would have developed the romance part of the story a little better. <BR>I would only recommend Underworld if you're desperate for a vampire film, otherwise skip this one and watch the original From Dusk Till Dawn for a bloody goodtime.
B00012QM8G|1.0|I simply cannot fathom why Spielberg would allow his masterpiece to be given such a shallow exhibition.  E.T. was enshrined compared to this.  The best thing I can say for it is its physically smaller than my version on laserdisc.
B000060P79|5.0|My God.Simple Plan is a Great Band. They play all of their own instruments, write their own songs, and they sound like an actual band(Not to mention how hot they are.) I dont know what people have against them...they never said that they were punk, so if you're gonna call them posers find a good reason. Simple Plan may not be original but i mean which bands really are?..All music starts somewhere and expands. so if u listen to eminem or 50 cent they are not the first people to sing that sort of music either..(if u can call it music) If you dont like simple plan then dont listen to them.. its that simple(no pun intended)
B0001AP12G|4.0|I really like what Kanye West is bringing to the rap game....reminds me of the greats: Mos Def, Common, Talib Kweli, A Tribe Called Quest, etc. Moreover, He actually has something to say.....what a concept for hip hop in 2004. Although there are some hot tracks, there are too many skits, and it could have been better. Still a solid refreashing album, hopefully hip hop will move back in this direction, and away from the bubble-gum boy band rap....
0385510438|4.0|I found this to be another of John Grisham's interesting easy to read books.<br />With the help of a rich relative, Willie Traynor buys the paper where he is employed in Clanton, Mississippi.  From there he observes and participates in the story surrounding   a rape-murder and its aftermath.  This is another story of good versus bad.  The Padgitt family living on a small island near Clanton represent the bad. Their activities over the years included stealing, counterfeiting, moonshining and gunrunning. They have pretty much \\"owned\\" the county sheriff for a number of years and have been left free to pursue their own activities.  Danny Padgitt is charged with rape-murder as the victim has accused him by name just before her death.  He is tried and convicted in Clanton.  He leaves the courtroom with a threat to the convicting jury.  The good is represented by the Ruffin family.  This is a colored family living \\"across the tracks\\" so to speak, in a part of Clanton called Lowtown.  The mother, Callie, was a member of the Danny Padgitt jury.  The Ruffins had seven children and six of them had earned a PhD.  Willie Traynor spends considerable time with Callie and her family and often enjoys her sumptuous southern cooking.<br />After a few years in the state prison Danny Padgitt is released and jurors begin to meet untimely deaths.<br />Through Willie Traynor the author weighs in with opinions on a number of social/moral issues.  These include segregation in Mississippi, prohibition, and the impact of powerful discount stores on businesses of small towns.
B0000YWKHC|5.0|When I first began watching this film, I found myself wondering what all of the hype was about.  It didn't seem like particularly great acting, and the scenes seemed slow.  But by the end of the film, I realized that that was the genius.  I was totally sucked into the dialogue, into the relationships, and into the lives of the two main characters.  The acting was amazing simply because you believe you are watching two regular people - they aren't acting, they ARE these people.  Combined with a superb soundtrack, this film has easily topped my short list of favourite films.
0767827716|4.0|John Carpenter's CHRISTINE (1983) is teenage horror/suspense in the fine tradition of CARRIE. Like the aforementioned (and superior) classic, it involves an introverted teenage outcast who is ruled by an iron fist at home, is bullied endlessly by mean-spirited jerks, and destroys them with supernatural powers that are understood only by the protagonist. In that same tradition, however, our hero loses control over her/his powers and is eventually destroyed by them. That's the basic formula in a nutshell. However, before you can shout, &quot;Ripoff!&quot; let it be known that CHRISTINE gives us a unique treatment of the same basic theme, and ends up being a complete story that is unique, well-paced and suspenseful in its own right. Plus, it also has terrific acting.<br />Keith Gordon, as the nerdy Arnie Cunningham whose personality is transformed by the titular red 1958 Plymouth Fury that he buys in order to help win the attention of Leigh Cabot (the winsome Alexandra Paul), is brilliant and spellbinding in his portrayal of this very fragile character. His slow but steady descent into revenge, cruelty and madness is especially intriguing; he goes from being a very sympathetic character in the first half of the film to a complete raging sociopath by its end. Psychologically, his transition from shy doormat to dangerous monster is perhaps even more frightening than Carrie White's parallel metamorphosis; Carrie lost everybody who was--or whom she thought was--on her side, but Arnie ends up losing his soul.<br />In addition to Keith Gordon's terrific performance, we have John Stockwell as Arnie's best friend Dennis, who unsuccessfully tries to keep Arnie from going off the deep end.  Also in a memorable supporting role is the venerable Robert Prosky, going totally against type to play the grouchy, scruffy, foulmouthed auto-body shop owner Will Darnell.  Although the wonderful veteran character actor Harry Dean Stanton appears in this film, he is very much wasted in the thankless role of Detective Rudolph Junkins, whose only function is to show up every once in a while to ask Arnie some suspicious questions after someone gets offed. (It is of note that the future Mrs. John Travolta herself, Kelly Preston, has a bit part as well.)<br />CHRISTINE may not be the best Horror film ever made, but I do think that it's one of the best.  The story is extremely interesting and really hooks you from the first scene onwards.  In addition to the acting, the editing is first-rate; indeed, it is so good that the premise of a possessed and evil car actually looks believable!  Then there is the music: 50's Rock 'N' Roll makes up the most of the soundtrack, although George Thorogood's early-80's classic &quot;Bad To The Bone&quot; is used to good effect.  The car's radio is practically a character-within-a-character, and is used so effectively that the first sound of it inspires a real sense of danger.  Of course, John Carpenter has to be fully commended for a great job in bringing Stephen King's vision to life on the screen.<br />RECOMMENDED<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR HORROR FANS
B000002KDO|5.0|after releasing Paranoid, Black Sabbath's next album, Master of Reality, would rival Paranoid's greatness. Full of Black Sabbath's heaviest material, Master of Reality is one of their best albums.<br />sweet leaf: 10/10<br />a strange cough and fantastic riff open up this fantastic album. The songs meaning is pretty obvious, especially after listening to it several times. Also included in the song is some really skilled guitar that it very fun to listen to.<br />after forever: 10/10<br />Its pretty funny to be hearing Ozzy singing such pro-christian lyrics in a song, especially considering all the allegories of them being a satanist band. After forever is an okay song when you first hear it, but it really grows on you, and now its one of my favorite songs on the album.<br />embryo: 9/10<br />a very short but fun to listen to song. Its really more of an intro to children of the grave than a song itself, but that doesn't stop me from liking it<br />children of the grave: 10/10<br />my personal favorite song. Very fast and full of energy.<br />Orchid: 10/10<br />very calm and un-sabbath like, but admittedly also a fun song to listen to.<br />lord of this world: 10/10<br />another christian song (well, sort of) but this time its about how satan controls the hateful people of the world, forcing them to do his bidding. <br />solitude: 10/10<br /> similar to the previous two odd numbered songs, solitude is a slow song with tony(I think) on flute. Somebody said Bill Ward sang on this song, but thats just as much of a lie as him singing of planet caravan, both of which Ozzy is the singer. Bill did, however, sing on swinging the chain, but that's about it. In fact, I believe Ozzy sang with a similar voice later on one of his solo albums, but I forget the name.<br />into the void 10/10<br />my second favorite song on this album. Its about fleeing the problems of earth to travel space. The echo effect is very interesting and sounds good on the song.<br />total score:79/80<br />This album had fantastic drums and bass, better than many Black Sabbath albums, and I just wanted to give them credit, since they deserve it. All in all, this is a great Sabbath album I really reccomend to anyone getting into the band.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Here's a movie that is sure to really take your breath away, whether you like musicals or not.  Every so often Hollywood comes out with an ambitious production that is pulled off beautifully by director, cast &amp; crew.  This is one such example of this!<br />The film stars Renee Zelwegger and Catherine Zeta-Jones as two women awaiting trial for murder during the Roaring 20s.  Zelwegger plays Roxie, a somewhat neurotic young woman who dreams of being the &quot;center of attention&quot; on a broadway stage.  Jones plays Velma, a woman who has already experienced such fame.<br />Roxie looks upon everything that happens in her life thru the lens of Vaudeville.  [It's because of this that the film turns out to be a musical].  By the time she gets to prison, Velma is the &quot;celebrity prisoner&quot; who gets all the publicity.<br />Richard Gere plays a fast-talking, suave lawyer who is hoping to get both of the girls off the hook (for a price).  His goal is to manipulate the media, public opinion and the jury in the girl's cases.<br />In the process, Roxie ends up supplanting Velma as the #1 prisoner celebrity.  Ironically, Roxie gets all the attention that she craved all her life, only it's from being a murderess instead of being a star.<br />Lucy Liu has a cameo as a heiress who threatens to usurp the celebrity status from both of them and grab the spotlight for herself.  All 3 women are cute in their 1920s short hairstyles, tho I must say I'm glad those hairstyles are no longer around!<br />One of the most impressive aspects of this film is that all the actors did their own singing and dancing.  There were no body doubles, stand-ins or lip-sinking.  Zelwegger said afterward that this was the most physically demanding movie she'd ever done, and it shows.<br />As a sidenote, it's interesting to note that the film is based on a play that was published in 1930.  The play was written by a journalist of the time and was a satire on women getting off of murder raps.  The film details how the courtroom itself can be turned into a stage for choereographed theatrics as opposed as a venue for finding the facts of a case.<br />While the duet between Jones &amp; Zelwegger is in itself worth the price of this DVD, there is so much more.  This one is a can't-miss film.  It is feel-good in the sense that a talented group of people went out and tried to pull off a near-impossible project.....and they nailed it!The film details how the courtroom itself can be turned into a stage for choereographed theatrics as opposed as a venue for finding the facts of a case.<br />While the duet between Jones &amp; Zelwegger is in itself worth the price of this DVD, there is so much more.

0385504209|1.0|Clearly everyone and his dog has had his or her nose buried in this book for quite some time, but I didn't get to it until it was loaned to me by someone whose opinions I respect, then recommended by another friend in the same category.  Oh my goodness.  I'll acknowledge that I only read three chapters.  The writing was so bad I just couldn't get any further.  Combine that with the assertion, in the third (and my last) chapter that a spring evening in Paris was &quot;winding down&quot; prior to 1 AM (as evidenced by the main, purportedly, character's observation that he had been asleep 20 minutes prior, which time was given as 12:32).  A small detail, yes, but evidence that this author has so little respect for his audience that I would not invest any more of my time when there are actually well-written, non-pandering books out there to read.
B000005JA8|1.0|I say humbug, and ask that anyone who disagrees with it look the word up in the dictionary before they write another stupid 5-star review.  The point is this: you can either believe that it was carefully constructed (in absolute ignorance of the facts), in which case my comments are sour grapes, or you can believe that this album is a hoax, in which case my comments are the only valid response.  Take your pick, but don't shoot the messenger.  This album is humbug in the worst sense of the word.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|I recently watched Party Monster becasue I had once seen a preview somewhere for it and I thought that it looked just so messed up and crazy that I had to see it. My first reaction was laughter at the beginning of the film, because Seth Green's character's attitude towards Mac's character was just funny. The movie, charachters, costumes, set design, story-line and music drew me in and eventually I caught myself thinking about certain parts of the film days after I had watched it. That's what makes a good movie. Even though it was a little out there, I am expecting my copy of the book and an audio cd about the same \\"club kids\\" era any day now from amazon.com. I'm still interested.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|I just finished watching Concert for George on PBS. First time I've seen it. You gotta have this CD and probably also the DVD. The music was exceptional. So many great songs. Wah Wah, Isn't it a Pity, Something, All Things Must Pass. I can't wait to get it and have it blast from my stereo.<br />It's easy to forget the impact George had. It's been so long since I first heard his music. Music is different now. Not nearly as moving. The Concert for George brought it all back for me. It will for you too.
B000007OY0|5.0|You can read a lot of reviews here about how great the movie is.  I agree that this is a SUPER movie and a wonderful story and a GREAT ending. <br />My ONLY problem with the movie was the portrayal of the warden as a christian.  This was terribly insulting considering he was such an evil and corrupt SOB.<br />Get past that and this is a classic.
6305364648|5.0|Next to The Terminator, probably Arnold's best action flick!  Arnold is a &quot;meek&quot; businessman with a quiet family, who is secretly one of the top CIA agents around.  This is a fun movie all around with a super evil main villian, a gorgeous villianess (Tia Carrera), a funny and likeable sidekick (Tom Arnold steals the movie) and the quiet housewife (Jaime Lee Curtis) who craves a life with more &quot;excitement.&quot;<br />Many memorable scenes and super action.  The movie succeeds well when it tries to be funny.  There are also some touching family moments.  This movie has something for everybody!
0385504209|2.0|The anti-christian story line and the woman's down play in christianity is interesting.  All the puritan, christian fundamentalists hate it.  This is not meant to be truth but fiction!!!<br />The plot itself is very simple and unlike Agatha Christie or Sir Conan Doyle, I figured out the ending about half way through and by 2/3 of the book it was confirmed.<br />Ths bits about Paris and London are OK if you have never been there.<br />Overall entertaining but far from the fuss that every one makes of it.  can only be read once.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Some who don't care for Memento give hints on what may or might have happened in this fine movie... watch where you read. It's better to let this movie take you on a backwards path from end to beginning.  It's truly fascinating. If you're not sure whether you'll like it, just look at the stars. You stand around a 90% chance of enjoying this film. From the moment I popped the DVD in, the main menu just blew me away. It's the MUSIC, by composer David Julyan. I watched this a couple months ago and the music stayed in my subconscious. Finally had to play the movie again, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time, even after knowing all the twists and turns.<br />I don't want to rehash what I'm sure most people do in these reviews. Reading them makes you feel sometimes like you're reliving Groundhog Day. One enjoyable thing was the way the DVD was produced. There is actually a dual main menu, and you can access the secondary one by slipping into the audio selections and then returning to the main menu. Even the building of the scene selections is a completely different approach to producing a DVD. More companies should be so innovative in bringing a fresh approach to creating unique menus.<br />This is a great movie for thinking people to watch. It is one of the better- written and edited movies out there. And I know that most movie- goers want a movie that challenges the mind. Lenny (Guy Pearce) does plenty of thinking and I found myself trying to get into HIS mind because, while the story plays backwards, I want to know just where he's going and how he can keep his sanity. If I had the same condition as Lenny, I'd be completely paranoid -- I wouldn't trust anyone. What better way to remember than having information tattooed? But how easy you can be manipulated when you have short term memory loss.<br />I see there is a new limited edition of Memento at about the same cost as the original DVD, and I plan on owning this one. Rent the film and you'll more than likely discover that you'll want to watch it time and again, so you may as well pick up a copy. Listen. Most people voted Memento with a perfect score and less than 10% gave it a &quot;D&quot; or worse grade in a highly- respected movie site with a total of over 67,000 votes. Across the board demographically, the voters gave it at LEAST 8/10, with women 45 or older giving it just under 8. I would have thought that people under 18 might not like it so much, but they are consistent with the overall score. So get it.ely discover that you'll want to watch it time and again, so you may as well pick up a copy. Listen.

B00000DQSV|5.0|Being a D/D fan from way back I'm also astouned at the criticism of the record.  This is simply a great record, one of my all time favorites, almost every song is a repeat listen.  Don't listen to the naysayers as this is a great record.
B000005JA8|1.0|This album is a trick, I'm sorry to say.  It was an experiment to see if people would pretend to like a bunch of bollox if it had enough promotion.  A similar experiment was done at an art exhibition - they showed paintings that were done by affixing a brush to a donkey's tail.  In both cases, people who pretend to like it come off as absolute nitwits.  Don't be hoodwinked; don't even try to pick the red in this album, it's all black.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|One is a good compilation but is still needing work. It's like a half done project. Many songs like &quot;Lucy in the Sky&quot; &quot;With a little help from my friends&quot;, &quot;In my life&quot; etc... is missing.

B000002NJS|1.0|This is supposed to be techno? If that's the case, then 'N Sync must be a hardcore punk band. I've listened to the tracks and there is no bold reinvention, no meaningful lyrics, no substance at all - just a somewhat technologically-advanced version of the adult contemporary pap Madonna has always recorded. She somehow managed to turn what should have been 15 minutes of fame into 15 years, but it wasn't her music or singing that did it. Her voice is still painfully thin and often nasal, the music is nowhere near as entrancing as REAL techno, and the lyrics rehash the same themes.  Take this example: Apparently Madonna has a fleeting interest in becoming a neurosurgeon, as we've concluded from these lyrics - you've got &quot;You're frozen when your heart is not open&quot; from &quot;Frozen&quot;, and &quot;Your heart is not open so I must go&quot; from &quot;The Power Of Goodbye&quot;. Many of the other lyrics also sound like a self-absorbed pat on the back, but that's to be expected from Madonna. Anyway, most techno sounds better without lyrics/vocals unless they add something bold and interesting to the songs (like Underworld and Apollo Four Forty) - that's not the case with the dull and predictable Ray Of Light. Trust me, once you get into some real techno (not some adult contemporary act who's desperately trying to make teenagers think she is cool) you'll forget this ever existed.
B00005JMKI|5.0|I always felt Nicole Kidman was perhaps over-rated, but after seeing \\"Dogville\\" I believe she simply wasn't given the best roles in the past.  Her performance in \\"Dogville\\" is so magnificent that I am stunned that she was overlooked for an Oscar nomination.  This leaves her role in \\"The Hours\\" for dead.<br />\\"Dogville\\" is a film that is not for everyone. Its stage-like presentation will turn many off, but there is a real meaning to this.  The film explores the dark side of us all, and everyone is on 'display'.<br />Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a fugitive who has stumbled into Dogville looking for a place to hide.  The townfolk agree to hide her in return for favours. Sound simple doesn't it ... but it isn't.  <br />The 3 hour duration of the film has been criticised but it is worth holding out for the surprise ending!<br />\\"Dogville\\" will become a classic in years to come.  I've seen nothing at all like it.  When you find a film that you still think about days after ... well, that says something special about the film.
B00000IPAX|1.0|This is one of the most insipid collections of nauseating pop ditties I can think of. Listen to the lyrics of \\"All The Small Things\\" and it becomes clear that they are emulating boy groups, since the subject matter is something groups like NSYNC sing about all the time. When they aren't trying to attract swooning teenyboppers, they display scatological and sexual fixations, which once again shows a lack of intelligence - but what did you expect, it's Blink 182. Several attempts at humor are made throughout the album, which would have left an impact if the lines were actually funny and weren't merely a ploy to get noticed. All of the songs on the album sound very much alike, with the exception of \\"Adam's Song\\", an improvement over the rest of their material which focuses on what goes through the mind of a suicidal teenager. Other than that, and unless you are buying the album to be \\"cool and accepted\\" by your TRL-loving peers, I definitely wouldn't recommend this album, and would instead suggest Bad Religion, Propagandhi and Pennywise for those looking for true punk.
B0000024ZT|3.0|With it's dense-packed lyrics and folky musical feel, Bruce's debut was an album that barely hinted at what was to come.  Caught between the record company's desire to make a singer/songwriter out of him and his own desire to be a flat out rocker, Greetings comes out sounding uneven, but despite this several songs manage to creep out as flat out classics.  Future Manfred Mann fodder Blinded By The Light and For You hinted at his genius, but in my opinion Growin' Up, Spirit In The Night and It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City confirmed that what we were dealing with was the next big thing.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Man oh man, this is bad. It's amazing that millions of people eat this up without realizing for a second that this is pure cheese with no substance whatsoever. To describe the sound of In The Zone, just imagine your little sister banging on a Casio keyboard and singing insipid lyrics in an off-key voice.  Britney Spears should be immensely thankful for modern technology, which covers up all her vocal inadequacies that become all too apparent on stage (hence, the reason why she lip-syncs).<br />After listening to this album you realize that absolutely anyone could be in the place of Britney Spears.  She's just a person with lots of connections and no talent.  <br />As for the subject matter of these songs, it's all about how sexy and amazing Britney Spears thinks she is.  Check out the lyrics to \\"Outrageous\\": \\"Outrageous, when I move my body / Outrageous, when I'm at a party...\\" - the song continues with that pattern and could be one of the worst songs ever.  We haven't even mentioned the cloying, cringe-inducing \\"Everytime\\" or \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" - parents, this song alone should keep you from purchasing any more Britney Spears CDs for your children.<br />As for the rest, you can expect the same synthesized drum programming, cliched lyrics, and of course Spears' studio enhanced voice, which was found on all 3 of her previous albums. Not a lot of time went into making this album, but then again, Spears' fans obviously place image first, music second. I doubt her fans even respect her music, let alone listen to it. How could they? The music is merely a promotional device to sell the image of Spears to teen girls and middle-aged men. This is only popular because the media is repeatedly exposing people to it, but when the hype machine is turned off, this will be completely forgotten. Avoid it like the plague.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I've listened to PINK since her first album, Can't Take Me Home (which I have on tape and should get the CD). First of all, PINK can sing anything!!! She grew up listening to R&amp;B and rock (she was a singer in a band). I really like her voice and versitility (those people who did not like this album did not understand it and are used to her older material). I enjoyed this album, and my favorites are Humble Neighborhoods, Catch Me While I'm Sleeping, Hooker, and Unwind (where she parallels her life to Janis Joplin, who was one of her influences). GO PINK GO!!!!!
B000009ED0|1.0|This CD has to be the most unintentionally hilarious thing I've ever heard. When Kid Rock makes attempts at being humorous (like on &quot;Cowboy&quot; or the title track) I always ask myself it that was supposed to be funny, but when he goes for maudlin sentimentality like on the updated '80s power ballad tripe of &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot;, I burst out laughing. Kid Rock can't sing a lick, which is proven by the fact that he uses a vocoder through the whole song. The lyrics are incessant whining and sound contrived - it is Kid Rock's cry for sympathy though he doesn't need it, nor does he deserve it. Many of the songs on this album sound like a ill-conceived cross between Vanilla Ice and Poison, with the only remotely good song being &quot;I Am The Bullgod&quot;, which rocks harder and has some engaging lyrics. The only reason why it sold so much is because MTV hyped it up as being some fantastic album - now you can find it in cutout bins everywhere. Without merits of its own, it's safe to assume that &quot;Devil Without A Cause&quot; would have languished in obscurity if not for MTV's support.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|First to those who said they didnt like the movie, STOP! If your intellect cannot understand anything that is going on DO NOT blame the movie, blame your mother for giving you a defected brain. If you blieve in God and that He created your brain, Pathetic, obviously my brain from my mother is much better than those created by God.<br />With that said Revolutions is very intense and action packed, I didn't see the movie on premier so I doubted it when some yet-evolved apes said it was dull. It was not, this movie keeps my attention on throughout the movie. I wanted to watch the movie over and over. Yes there are less fights in the Matrix, but the real world battle was intense.<br />On a comparison note to that academic winning four letters movie which also has three series. That movie is nothing comparing to the Matrix, The VFX of Matrix is the best of any movies ever made, and it gets better with each series. The story of Matrix is original and refreshing, unlike some movie copy the RPG game story over (which by the way I can tell you the ending by seeing the first of the series), that's lame. I never fell asleep watching Matrix, but that 3 hours long DULL academic winning movie is what I called \\"counting sheeps\\"
B00013F38K|1.0|OK folks, I'm back to impart some more wisdom on you Grass-hoppas!<br />You say that Carradine is perfect for the role? You say that the show is not racism in action?<br />Well, let me put it in another way so as to finally settle this for those of you who are really slow, like Carradine with his kung-fu, to understand. Lets look at this in an objective way as if we're casting this for the first time:<br />We have 2 candidates and we'll examine their qualifications like a job interview:<br />David Carradine<br />-Kung-fu skills - None to speak of before the show. It looks like he did manage to learn some Tai-chi during the years while he was on the show, but as anyone with a kernel of knowledge about martial arts knows, tai-chi is an exercise NOT a fighting technique. If you ever tried that in real life, you'll get your butt kicked.<br />-Acting skills - Again, not really any to speak of. His on screen presence is about as exciting as watching paint dry. I don't think Carradine had been in a show before Kung-fu? He was in some drive-in flick Boxcar Bertha the same year. Nice sex scene!  But no Kung-Fu there...<br />-Language Skills - Spoke perfect American English even though he tried to speak with an accent on the show.<br />-Pacifism - People mistake his lousy acting to him being able to play a pacifist monk.<br />Bruce Lee<br />-Kung-fu skills - A master at many different styles. In fact he was so good that he was able to adapt the different styles that he's mastered over the years into one that is truly effective in real life situations. That slow-mo Tai-chi that Carradine does on the show would be just a walk in the park for Bruce Lee. He could do it while he's asleep. Guess what the monks at Shaolin practice? Yup, they practice fighting methods, non of that slo-mo garbage although they also know how to do it. The slo-mo stuff's reserved for the old geezers morning exercise in the park .<br />-Acting skills - Has a presence on screen that's like no other. He even wowed viewers with Kato before the Kung-Fu series. A worldwide phenomenon in his subsequent movies which proves his worthiness.<br />-Language Skill - Had a real Chinese American English accent and thus didn't need to fake it.<br />-Pacifism - Bruce Lee knows how to act pacifist if the role calls for it just like certain scenes in the Game of Death. That character was the most quiet and introspective character he's played. He hardly had any lines. But the great thing about it is that when the time calls for it, he can be explosive, like a tiger ready to pounce. Carradine couldn't scare a mouse.<br />So there you have it. Tell me, based on just these few key qualifications which is the more qualified candidate for the job? Now what do you think was the cause for the producers to cast a clearly INFERIOR candidate for the part? One Word, RACISM!<br />And don't give me any of that Ben Kingsley, Peter Sellers non-sense. Everyone knows that the Brits are just about the MOST racist people on the planet. They look down at anyone who's not blue blood. If I were Indian I would be royally pissed at the Brits for making fun of my race. I do however, understand why they cast Kingsley in the Gandhi part. He actually looks like him and he's a really great actor. However, Carradine doesn't even remotely look Chinese nor does he know how to act so why was he cast?ewers with Kato before the Kung-Fu series.

0062515675|1.0|I was recommended this book because I work too much. Every page that I managed to get through was painful. This book is the saddest and most excruciating way to introduce Buddhist philosophy. It is a \\"Fable\\" with a capital \\"F\\". Nothing in the book is true. If something in the book has been based on a true concept it has been so badly distorted by this text that it is no longer even close.  To summarize for those that don't need the rest of the review to know that this is a book to skip here is a banal platitude from the book that forced me to emit an audible groan while I was reading it: \\"Your `I can' is greater than your IQ\\"<BR>It starts out with this absolute fat jackass womanizing alcoholic unscrupulous lawyer, that would essentially be better of dead, and that I personally hated to read about, and would hate to know, and wouldn't talk to except to make rude noises at if I did know him because I was related to him or something. You are then told that he is basically a good person but unless your  \\"I can\\" is greater than your \\"IQ\\" you aren't fooled even for a second. Then he has a heart attack and goes to India and meets a guru, and turn into this soft and supple bi-curious sounding freak that wears long red robes and pours tea all over a former colleagues wife's Persian rug to illustrate concepts that aren't really true. In essence he's an even bigger jerk that is now ultra self-important because he's this transformed guru come back to bring enlightenment to all the normal people that weren't alcoholic womanizing hoodlums to begin with.<BR>I understand that the author is merely creating a construct in order to peddle his psuedo-Buddhist philosophy, but he couldn't have chosen less likable characters, or more stupid illustrations for his concepts. While reading the book you get the feeling he spent a million years trying to come up with analogies for his concepts and then finally gave up and put something that didn't make sense, leaving you to shake your head andgo... \\"Couldn't he have gotten a classroom of second graders to brainstorm something that was at least stupid in an interesting way?\\" Sharma (the author) has to be the least creative man ever to exist. I would be shocked if the book was even his idea. While reading it, I seriously got the feeling that he had watched an infommercial  on how to write a book for fun and profit, and that the idea for this book came in his information packet. <BR>Other than being evisceratingly boring and stupid this book makes a few good points. Actually the book does not specifically make any good points. It makes wild, ridiculous, impractical, idiotic points that may touch upon elements that the reader could formulate a good idea from. However these good points are not particularly profound. It is the same wisdom that has been available to you since grade-school. Maybe if you are such a louse that everyone including yourself hates you, and your family wishes you were dead, it would be good for you to hear them again. <BR>The jerk in this book merely traded one Ferrari for another, he is still an egoist, only now he is some sort of religious padre, begging you to worship his smooth supple skin (referenced on every page of the book). His identity is still his work. Only before he was despicable in a suit, and now he should be selling juicers on late night wearing hooded robes, as he pours smoothie all over the before-people to illustrate that their bodies can't accept anymore nutrients until they give up the nutrients that they already have.

0141439831|5.0|One of the greatest triumphs of the 19th Century / Victorian novel is the way in which it masters the English language, utilizing it with such eloquence that, nearly bordering on indulgent by today's standards, is nothing less than breathtaking.  This combines with the ability to create characters so thoroughly developed that the reader cannot help but be invested in their fate (be it with or without sympathy).  Thackeray's Vanity Fair is, in my opinion, a near perfect example of the greatness of the Victorian novel.  The sheer length of his epic allows him to spare no expense giving the reader every detail of his characters, in addition to a very pointed and often-amusing critique of 19th Century military society.  His novel is as much a satire of social ascendency as it is a love story.  One can be gripped by the trials of Becky and Amelia and amused by his criticisms with equal fervor. He weaves the stories of the characters in such a way that the reader's opinion of them may (and perhaps, should) change several times.  The end (not to reveal one detail) underscores Thackeray's committment to Vanity Fair as a novel of satire.  He provides excellent characterization of every possible sentimental disposition, from the absolutely wicked to the unquestionably benevolent.  While pages of the book may seem tangential to the plot, his 'digressions' are not without merit as examples of satire or his eloquent style.<br />I can say that I am disappointed at the apparent ignorance of this novel by many curricula.  While authors like Austen, Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Dickens and even Trollope are well-known, Thackeray seems to be somewhat unheard-of in general society.  While I am no less a fan of the former writers (I can claim the 19th Century British novel as my favorite genre), I think that Thackeray (and Vanity Fair in particular) is worth at least comparable attention and acclaim.  I recommend Vanity Fair for any fan of 19th Century British literature, pointed social satire, or classic world literature in general.  This epic will appeal to the romantic and cynic with equal depth.<br />Note: I recommend especially the re-issue of the Penguin Classics edition.  While admitting myself as a fan of the series in general, this edition's exclusion of Thackeray's hand-drawings is, as noted by editor John Carey, a likely advantage for the novel's reader.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Here's what puzzles me. As a film marketer, I know that after the first week what sells a movie is word of mouth. <br />&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; has played in some towns here and abroad for weeks, in some cases months. I wish I'd been involved in pushing it. Here's the fact: if a movie has a lot of hype and then doesn't live up to it the marketing pattern is that it drops off very fast after the first few days as everyone tells their friends it sucks. <br />That's why we open some expensive movies we have doubts about (Stargate for example) in as many theaters as possible (sometimes without even letting critics see them first). Then a lot of people will have seen them by the time everyone gets the bad news.<br />You can't keep the momentum on a bad movie going. It is just impossible. In the end, friend telling friend is what sells it. Or what kills it. But then I look at the reviews here and see so much supposedly bad &quot;word of mouth&quot;. I have to tell you as a marketer that it must be far outweighed by the good. It's far from representative.<br />The ongoing marketing success proves it. If everyone told their friends &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was bad it would have died in a few weeks, no matter how many times its director and stars appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.<br />Why am I telling you this? Because this is a great movie. Small, sensitive, funny, romantic in an adult way. I don't know anyone among my friends who isn't very enthusiastic about it.  It's easy to get sick of my job. I know a lot of what I have to sell is awful. The rare movie likes this makes it easy to think it's worthwhile after all. Believe it or not, not all of us in the industry are happy with FX heavy trash.
B0000027DJ|5.0|I dont care what the old school die hard fans of Alice say about this metal era of songs. This album is a great album. I strongly recomend you buy this album with &quot;TRASH&quot; as they really should be a 2 disc album! They both contain some of the greastest hard rockin metal songs i've ever heard. With an all star selection of guest musicions, how could these albums fail? I dont understand why these albums are so cheap to buy? on both those albums you hear a completly amazing onsomble of great musicions &quot;Stef burns - huewy Lewis &amp; The News&quot; &quot;Bon Jovi&quot; &quot;Ozzy Osbourne&quot; &quot;Joe Satriani&quot; &quot;Steve Vai&quot; &quot;Nikki Sixx&quot; and many more.... these albums are absolute metal masterpeices, and if you dont like them, get your head exsamined, if your a rock n roll fan then these albums are a must have! every track, even if you dont like them at first, give them a few listens and they will grow on you till you love them!

B000005JA8|1.0|I finally discovered the origin of that get down, get down expression as it relates to music.  This is as far down as music can possibly go, to the point of not being music at all anymore.  Beefheart was just trying too hard to show us the beef, and not hard enough to show us some heart.  This album stinks.
B000000OSE|5.0|I've heard alot of people say Gunners only have one good album &quot;Apetite for destruction&quot; well there wrong!!!! This album is certinly as great, and IMO better! <br />This album took a few listens to get used to, but after a while it grew on me and became an album i have to have always with me! This is a great album, and if you dont have a gunenrs album , but are looking, then i recomend this one and &quot;AFD&quot;
B000002NE4|5.0|Nick Cave is many different things to many different people. However he is generally only thought of as &quot;The Ausralian Black Prince of Gothic Rock&quot; in the printed media. Regardless of what you want to call him, in The Boatman's Call he has produced a beautiful and amazing masterpiece. More his own personal work, than a Bad Seeds album, Nick Cave produces some of his greatest Lyrics and Tunes that are rich in imagery, allegory and sadness. Such songs as &quot;People Ain't No Good&quot; &quot;Brompton Oratory&quot; &quot;Where Do We Go But Nowhere&quot; &quot;Into My Arms&quot; &quot;Are you the one I Have Been Waiting For&quot; are some of his best recordings in an career that has spanned more than twenty years. Maybe not for everybody, but the music is undeniably beautiful if incredibly sad. A good album to listen to when you are depressed, for Mr Cave will make you feel better in the knowing that there is at least one more tormented soul out there.
B00008WT5E|5.0|Any AC/DC fan will tell you this is one of AC/DCs best!

The song should defnitly have been inculded!
B000084T18|1.0|First off, I would like to say that people giving this album review 3 or more stars don't really know a thing or two about rap. This is the most overrated rapper and album of all time. I heard this album bumped out Snoop Dogg's \\"Doggystyle\\" as the fastest selling debut album with 800,000 copies sold in a week and about 6 million (if I'm not mistaken) copies sold worldwide. Wow. Is this for real? The answer is HELL NO. This is nowhere near Snoop's \\"Doggystyle\\". I don't know why there's so much hype about this idiot. In my opinion, the reasons why this album sold that much is because he was backed up by the legendary Dr. Dre and Eminem. I don't know what happened to Dr. Dre, why he gave this fool a chance. Another reason is that people hear critics about him and this album and they are curious to find out what this fuss is all about, that's why they buy this garbage. I am one of those, the only reason I give this album a try is out of curiosity.  Now that people know what 50 cent is all about, they won't anymore be buying whatever garbage he is throwing on his next albums. I'm willing to bet that 50's next album wouldn't sell half as much as this garbage sold. If he is lucky, maybe his next album will reach platinum because of the idiots who patronizes this kind of trash. 50 cent has to be the most overrated rapper there is along with Gay-z (thank God he's retiring - please don't come back), Ja Rule (Pac wannabee), Nelly (King of Hip-Pop), Chingy (stupid newbie), Ludacris. And what about that stupid beef with Ja Rule. 50 Cent and Ja Rule has got to be  \\"2 of amerikaz most overrated and hated rappers\\". There are so many people who hated Ja Rule (50 cent, DMX, Busta, Eminem, Dr. Dre, Kurupt, Daz and many more). The same can be said about 50 cent ( Ja, Gay-z, Scarface, Beanie Seagel, Lil' Kim and many more). I think they only hype up their stupid beef to boost up their album sales. As what you know, people really like somebody dissin' someone like what happened in the Tupac-Biggie era where the West Coast - East Coast beef was still hotter than Anna Kournikova. That really boost up their album sales, and you can thank Suge Knight for that. I think 50 and Ja wants to re-ignite the heat of the East-West feud to boost up their album sales. But the problem is, they ain't Tupac and Biggie, HELL THEY\\"RE NOBODY. They both suck. They should do the music industry a big favor and follow the footstep of Gay-z that is to hang up their mics immediately. Their music sucks. Speaking of the album, the only one that you can look forward to are the beats because it is mostly handled by Dr. Dre and Eminem. The beats are good but 50 cent is whack. People should wake up and stop buying this kind of crap `rap'. In that way, people like 50 would be out of the rap map for good. There are so many underrated but deserving rappers (Kurupt, Daz, Mobb Deep, Scarface, E-40, to name a few) out there that deserves more attention and appreciation than these fake ass thugs. Let us support these real rappers instead of guys like 50 cent. I got this message for 50 cent. We will never love you like we love Pac because 1. you're music is crap  2. you are a fake ass thug and  3. you are sooo ugly.<BR>[!] PEACE [!]
B000000P17|1.0|Eck. I was wondering why i hadnt heard any of these songs on the radio? I knew it was the last thing they put out, and listning to the other albums and becoming a gunners fan, i bought this album and found out why i had never heard of any of these... this album is terrible. Its a bunch of cover songs and the only one I could stand was \\"hair of the dog\\" a cover of Nazereth... This album was terrible, they didnt sound like they where having any fun making it, and it lacked any GnR spirit...this without doubht the worst GNR album you could ever buy!

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is the best book I have ever read. It is about how people deal with major issues of racism during the segregation period. In the town of Maycomb County, a little family dealt with a lot of these serious issues of being bothered because Atticus Finch, the father of the family, defends black people. Atticus, a lawyer who is considered to do all the dirty jobs no one wants to do, is defending a Negro by the name of Tom Robinson. This wasn't considered a brave thing to do in their town, it was mainly thought of as stupid or a joke. The Cunninghams, another white family of Maycomb accused Tom of abusing and taking advantage of their older daughter, Mayela when he was allowed inside their fence, just to do a few chores. They claim that Tom beat her about the face, and on the arms, and then he got on top of her, just when the dad walked in and caught him.<BR> During this trial, the two Finch kids have struggles with other kids at school, because their dad is defending a Negro. The ending is unpredictable, and leaves you wanting more. If you want a good read, I urge you to get this book as soon as possible. It is one of the greatest books of our time, because it is realistic, and the author writes so well. To Kill a Mockingbird is really well written and it is written so that you have to infer a lot of the time, about some background knowledge of what went on in the past, during that time period. It is a good book that keeps you thinking, and you actually feel like you are there with the characters. i highly recommend this book.
B00006GFAB|1.0|Kiss have completly sold out in my book! Why are they releasing so many greatest hits albums? and not one of them has actually contained the songs that really are there greatest hits! This one lacks &quot;heavens on fire&quot; and &quot;domino&quot;<br />IMO these guys re-united to make more money, theres going to be as many greatest hits coming out every year as there are &quot;reunion tours&quot; ...dont be fooled for there money making scams, there not retired, and they learnt that that last album Cycho Circus went down the toilet as fast as possible....so there just going to keep recycling the same greatest hits all the time??? maybe they should try a double disc? maybe 3? a box set? somthing other then 500000 albums with the same songs on it? calling it a new name, does not mean people will be fooled into thinking its a new album or the first time youve released a GH! dont bother with this one, there will be another greatest hits come out next year, that one might be better then the past 10000!
1400049628|5.0|I have no clue why this book would be shelved alongside humorists like Dave Barry, when the subject matter is anything but funny. The book reads like a very serious guide, no funny pictures, no real jokes to be found (unless you count examples of what NOT to do with zombies as funny). What makes this book so good is that it paints a very realistic picture of zombies and zombie horror; there's no demons, no voodoo or mystic garbage, it's all science. And much of the advice is very well reasoned and insightful.<br />Also, if you plan to write a story about zombies or zombie outbreaks, this book will serve as a definitive guide to making a believable story.

B000000OSG|2.0|UYI2 to me didn't have the same impact as UYI1 or AFD, but its really about personal taste. Some people prefer this album over UYI1, but I suggest if your only into the songs that got radio airplay, you will probably be happier with the \\"greatest hits\\" CD.    Get in the ring, is a personal fav of mine, but the album to me sounds like it has \\"fillers\\" all over it. Unless your a gunners fan, this album may not appeal to you. And i again say, if the tracks you recognize are the ones on the greatest hits, go for that one.
B00008H2LB|5.0|kick a$$ cd....great...da lyrics are awesome...its linkin parks style at its best...
B000002IJA|4.0|Many people mistake this album for beeing a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album and i can assure you it is not! Steve King was making a new movie called &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; and he asked AC/DC if he could use a few of there songs in his movie! And they even wrote a few numbers for the movie , which 2 appear on the album &quot;D.T&quot; &amp; &quot;Chase The Ace&quot; which are intrumentals (no vocals)!<br />AC/DC also wrote a new song for the movie &quot;Who Made Who&quot; which is known as one of there best of the Brian era! <br />So forget people telling you this is a GH album, because it is not! If you already own other AC/DC albums that contain most of the songs on this album, then beware, this album only contains 3 songs! 2 of which have no lyrics! But if you dont own any AC/DC albums, or are looking to complete a collection, its a great album to have. If its WMW in particuler your after, you will like this album! <br />Really, if it was up to me? I'd have added &quot;who made Who&quot; &quot;D.T&quot; and &quot;chase the ace&quot; to the Album Fly On the Wall or &quot;blow up my video&quot;! The re-issue came with a downfall, you would hope they would rectify there mistake... originally the album was to contain a remixed version of Who Made Who and Shake Your Foundations... but only appeared on Australian Lps! youd think they might have included that when re-issuing it? so it drops one star for me for that reason!
B00003CXCT|5.0|OK, first of all, for all you folks who puke on the '97 Special Editions, you're really not gonna like the new DVD versions.  Word has it that the crew at Skywalker Ranch have continued to tweak and improve these classic films.  Meaning that the '97 versions were mearly \\"work in progress\\" releases.  And even after they're released on DVD this September, they'll continue being tweaked for the rumored Ultimate Editions that will come out later in an ultimate 6-movie box set.<br />Now don't get me wrong, I was born 3 years before the original Star Wars film hit theaters in May 1977, and I welcomed the Special Editions in '97 with open arms, because unlike many film purists, I feel I'm the true 'progressive' on these matters and I'm a Republican.  Imagine that!  I have always felt that the original films needed cleaning up and brought up to date with the emergence of computer enhanced effects.  I don't know, call me crazy for not wanting to see flashing \\"blue screen\\" boxes around the TIE Fighters as they streak across the screen.  I feel the one thing that kills realism in the movies is bad blue screen effects.  So I was more than happy that Lucas and ILM cleaned up the blue screen artifacts.<br />I also welcomed the additional CGI shots dispersed through-out the films.  The additional Mos Eisley shots, although they probably need additional work on them to clean them up a bit as the CG work was a bit primitive at the time in ~'96.  However the additional shots of X-Wings 'n stuff from the Battle of Yavin IV were especially cool.<br />But being fair and balanced, I did have a few objections to a few changes, like for instance some dialogue changes and other scenes, but at the same time, I wished they had added more scenes in certain places.<br />But enough about the SE contraversy.  So what about the DVDs?  Well, as I said before, these DVD versions will still yet again be different than the '97 versions.  What has changed?  Well, rumors have it that the light sabre effects have been enhanced.  One thing that always bothered me about ANH was the seemingly \\"white-looking\\" light sabre that Luke used in Obi-wans home and in the Falcon during the remote drone training.  So instead of the white blade, we might be getting a solid glowing blue sabre.<br />Another thing that bothered me was the 'dated' computer screens on the Death Star and on Yavin IV.  I mean they screamed 1977!  Much like the TV screens in the series Babylon 5 that screamed early '90s.  I'd like to see (if possible) new screens that would go along more with established continuity in the Prequal movies.ffects have been enhanced.

B00009MGR6|3.0|Apart from 74'Jailbreak, this is my least fav AC/DC album! Its not that I dont like it, I do , but if you have heard some of the unrleased tracks from this session, you would wonder why they chose to put the tracks on the album they did instead of<br />- Down On The Bordeline<BR>- Snake Eyes<BR>- Borrowed Time<br />which sound much better then alot of what made it onto this album! And if possible, they should have included them on the re-issue ,and i know that would have made the album alot better! <br />The best gems to come off this album is defnitly my fav &quot;Thats the way I wanna Rock'n'Roll&quot; and of coarse, &quot;heatseeker&quot; has had that much radio play here over the years you skip that track right away! none of the songs suck, but if you have heard the unreleased songs from this album... you probably would agree, theres a few youd rather have had replaced then what made it onto the album!<br />Even tho this is one of my least fav AC/DC albums: AC/DC's worst albums, are still better then most bands best albums!
0553573403|5.0|\\"The Song of Fire and Ice\\" series is not for everyone, especially those who cling to the Tolkien model as the only appropriate approach to the genre. Nor will it do much for the Salvatore set, or the frothing hoards of Robert Jordan devotees. Martin takes a very different approach here, one that relies on the reader wanting to be defied and challenged by events and characters and on the reader's indulgence for moral ambiguity.<br />There are very few characters in this book who can be called objectively evil. No evil sorcerers in black towers wringing their hands and enslaving his subjects. No glittering pure heroes destined to triumph. And absolutely no status quo. Characters speak and act like real people, with conflicting motivations and subjective morality, and without the common deux ex machina overtly saving the day.<br />The books are also very heavy on court politics and intruige, very light on outright action. Readers should know that going in. Most of the violence is closely tied to the politics, with large-scale battles ocurring offscreen. Readers who thrive on books that move from battle to battle might be put off.<br />In sum, these are fantasy books like no other. This is not to disparage other pulp fantasy writers, like Salvatore and Jordan, who have great chops and excel at their own version of the craft. I also don't want to draw the usual comparisons to Tolkien, which isn't really accurate at all. Martin and Tolkien have almost nothing in common apart from the fact that they are both writers. Their styles couldn't be more different, and the stories they both tell have almost nothing in common. Middle Earth is a world of absolutes, of identifiable good vs. identifiable evil, whereas Martin's is a place where there are no easily pegged absolutes.<br />That said, Martin is a master stylist, with a firm grip on his characters and a great story to tell. The only downside to jumping on the train is the 2-3 year wait in between books. The quality of the books, however, make the wait worthwhile.books, however, make the wait worthwhile.
B0000028PI|4.0|Tho there are other albums i'd recomend then this one, its still a damn great album. I give it 4 and half stars! Tho unlike the prevoius couple of albums from Alice, this album might not contiain a list of great superstar guest players, he has still managed to deliver a great album... its not quite as hard hitting as Trash or Hey Stoopid, but is still great!
B000005JA8|5.0|...I can tell by reading some of the recent reviews. This is an album that you will either love or hate. You get it or you don't get it. This music was composed and was later played live note for note and even at a quicker pace. This album is not noise, it is music albeit very atonal. This is rootsy Salvador Dali for the ears. <BR>  I have been listening to this disc for about 30 years and I am still amazed to hear some of the angular melodies that permeate from the guitars on this disc. The sections don't last long before they shift gears. A lot of small pieces of this puzzle are very enjoyable while others are very harsh. There is a great sense of humor in Don Vliet's delivery.<BR>  The different parts are played oftentimes in different time signatures which meet every 12th beat. 4/4 on 3/4. If this sounds foreign to you don't buy this CD. I give it 5 stars simple because I love quirky music. To each his own.

B0000026T4|5.0|I dont care what the old school die hard fans of Alice say about this metal era of songs. This album is a great album. I strongly recomend you buy this album with &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot; as they really should be a 2 disc albums! They both contain some of the greastest hard rockin metal songs i've ever heard. With an all star selection of guest musicions, how could these albums fail? I dont understand why these albums are so cheap to buy? on both those albums you hear a completly amazing onsomble of great musicions &quot;Stef burns - huewy Lewis &amp; The News&quot; &quot;Bon Jovi&quot; &quot;Ozzy Osbourne&quot; &quot;Joe Satriani&quot; &quot;Steve Vai&quot; &quot;Nikki Sixx&quot; and many more.... these albums are absolute metal masterpeices, and if you dont like them, get your head exsamined, if your a rock n roll fan then these albums are a must have! every track, even if you dont like them at first, give them a few listens and they will grow on you till you love them!
B00015HVI8|1.0|I was disappointed when I heard that Michael Shanks would be leaving the series after the fifth season but since Jack has always been my favorite character I figured I could deal.   Sure I missed Daniel but I still wanted to watch season six for Jack, Sam and Teal'c. But while I still enjoyed watching them - especially Jack - the season was pretty much ruined for me by the total waste of space called Jonas. I tried really hard to like him.  I WANTED to like him. But I found him so annoying and dull. He sucked the life out of every scene and just didn't seem to have that same spark and chemistry with the rest of the characters that Daniel always had. I found that the episodes I enjoyed most were the ones he wasn't in much.  If only they had gone with a three person team I think I would have enjoyed the season a lot more and would have given it a higher rating.  All I can say is thank God TPTB came to their senses and asked Michael Shanks back and gave Jonas a one-way ticket back to Kewlona.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|If your into this sound of music! Then this is a killer album! This album is a combination of there first 2 albums released in Australia , one called TNT and the other with the same name HighVoltage.... most of the tracks on this are from TNT except for just 2, but this album is a must have!
B00011V8CW|1.0|I happen to be a big fan, but this is some of Bowie's weakest material. Why all the glowing reviews? There are so many other better albums Bowie did. BTWN is a dud!
B00008WT5M|5.0|I keep seeing reviews on this album about how it didnt sound like AC/DC... and they didnt like Bruce Fairbairns producing sound... CRAP! this album rocks! the backing vocals sounded awsome! This album has many great hits, and not just the well known by everyone &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;....this album is great if you ask me. A terrific album that launched AC/DC into the 1990's with great force!<br />Tho, beeing a re-issue it should have had some extra tracks put in, but it doesnt matter.
0425170349|5.0|Rainbow Six is one of the most action-packed books I have ever read.  A new international counter-terror strike team is assembled, and is headed by an experienced CIA field officer named John Clark.  This team, Rainbow, is the best in the world, with team members from all around the globe.  For some mysterious reason, terrorism in the world increases, which keeps Rainbow busy defending its allies when a new threat surfaces, like none the world has ever seen.  Rainbow has to react and the all of humanity is depending on its actions.  If you are into guns and Special Forces, I would definitely recommend this book.  Once you start you won't be able to put it down.  The main reasons that I like this book are that the characters are very believable and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Clancy captivates his readers by evading to something intriguing or dangerous, but then he stops and talks about something else.  This leaves you curious to see what is going to happen next.  Clancy's knowledge of politics is extensive, and he uses this knowledge to create a whole new world of intricate politics to enshroud his readers.  Tom Clancy is an awesome writer and Rainbow Six is an awesome book.  I think that the theme of the book is that human life is the first priority.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|This was the first AC/DC album i brought and if you dont like this album ,get your head checked!<br />This is the ultimate AC/DC live album. Usually your bad reviews come from those fans that wont accept Brian took over from Bon and dont like Brian for it. Or they say it lacks the feel of a live show because a few songs fade out (its only crowed noise)<br />This is the best Live album ive ever heard! not a single song on here that dosent sound great! Make sure you get the 2 disc edition and not the one disc! Its not quite the greatest hits played live, but everyone of them is a great hit! <br />This is a great album , and if you dont have it, BUY IT (...)<br />A commen question that comes up about this album is \\"is the single disc edition, and the double disc edition diffrent tracks? or are they they same? The anser is; There the same! The double edition just comes with more songs, but there all the same songs as the single edition! Theres a rumour that Highway To Hell is diffrent, but its not!<br />My only problem with this re-issue is that they didnt include a track that came with the Japanese edition of this album \\"Hell Aint A Bad Place To Be\\" but its still the best live album out there next to to \\"If you want blood\\"

B00008WT5C|5.0|Some may argue that this is AC/DC best album! And they may be right, its defnitly one of the best and one of the best hard driving great hard rock guitar albums to this date!    This is a 5 star album.....But i only give it 4 and half stars on this reissue!    I'll tell you why?  Because when the album was first released in Australia, it had a track on it called \\"Crabsody In Blue\\" which many beleive is the seaqull to \\"The Jack\\" its a diffrent sounding AC/DC song, almost slide guitar bluesgrass sounding! But the song did not make it onto the version that went world wide because someone thought it was too disqusting? or didnt want to promote a song about having crabs! HAHAHAHA....so it was replaced by a song of the Australian DDDDC album called \\"Problem Child\\" and also an unreleased world wide song \\"Rocker\\" which was on there second album in Australia TNT!    So the only downfall to this re-issue is they did not include \\"Crabsody In Blue\\" it should be there in its rightfull place amongst the rest of the great songs!    Crabsody in blue can be heard if you use the connect thing of this CD and use it to connect to the website. But you can only listen to it, you cant save it and keep it. But with so many people complaining about the errors and problems connecting to all that stuff, it just makes it annoying that they didnt just put the damn tracks on the CD themselves.
B000003N8R|5.0|Having heard \\"Interstellar Space\\" (1967) and \\"Sun Ship\\" (1965) prior to this 1964 album, I was surprised by how down to earth it was. The same goes for the comparison of this with \\"Kulu Se Mama\\" (1965) and \\"Meditations\\" (1966), where two drummers and several percussionists are used at once, and a bigger band gives free improvisation, which in the opinion of many \\"standard jazz lovers\\", sounds chaotic. The classic Coltrane quartet took a dramatic turn (not necessarily for the worse) after \\"A Love Supreme\\" (1965), where a sign of change was already presented.<br />This album gives a side and sound of Coltrane that I don't think can be heard anywhere else - it's a deep and melancholy, yet sweet album with clear sound and excellent stereophony.<br />Between the first 18 and the last 19 minutes of the album is the short and up-lifting up-tempo \\"Bessie's Blues\\", which, with its outstanding \\"persona\\", lifts the album at the right point, and is the reason why this album is complete. The rest of the tunes are performed at 112 bpm and below. \\"Wise One\\" and \\"Lonnie's Lament\\" (both with long rubato introductions and endings) feature some of the most touching piano work I've heard by McCoy Tyner. Jimmy Garrison gives a three-plus minute unaccompanied bass-solo in \\"Lonnie's Lament\\" which adds a chapter in a flavour of its own to the song. \\"The Drum Thing\\" is also something new; a straight-eight tune, predominated by drums and a rhythmic one-note bass line, with a mesmerizing tenor melody (Coltrane doesn't play soprano sax on this album). The rhythm-section's unique co-operation and the sound of Trane's horn are here captured at their best. If you like Coltrane's music in any way, do not leave \\"Crescent\\" out of your collection!

I had to pause before reading another tale.  I was perplexed by the ending, I was astonished, blown away....I wanted to read it all over again as if it were my first time.  I envy you if you are new to this book, I assure you, you will be in for an incredible journey.
B00006IRJU|5.0|Its not hard to understand why this is one of Australis best selling albums of all time! The band put together some great songs here that range from a light rock to southing sounds and relaxing hangover music! And now with the re-issue including the great song &quot;touch the fire&quot; your getting an even better deal then the original release!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I do NOT understand the fascination with the movie OR Bill Murray's performance.  I didn't think the movie should even get a nod from the Academy.  Bill Murray's performance was &quot;just Bill Murray&quot;.<BR>Maybe there is something to this movie I didn't get?  Yeah, so the two characters were &quot;lost&quot; people....And???  Jokes?  Not in this movie!<BR>Doesn't deserve a rating in my book.
B00007BK2N|5.0|This was an especially fun movie for me to watch. These were my favorite bands in 1980, and it is fun to see them relived. There weren't many photos back then, and Factory Records had few, if any, liner notes.<BR>The film has great cameos, such as Howard Devoto, and Marky Smith.  I think it was well made, and anyone would enjoy it.

B00005JLRT|1.0|I personally think that &quot;Nemesis&quot; is the weakest StarTrek movie ever.<BR>Although the story is not at all bad and sometimes has some admirable subtlety to it, its realization is just too way off the usual StarTrek design and character plots. I believe this is due to the new director Stuart Baird, famous for his work as editor in &quot;Die Hard&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; and &quot;Superman - The Movie&quot;. But as this StarTrek movie clearly shows, a good editor isn't necessarily a good director - Jonathan Frakes might have been a better choice in this case as previous StarTrek films have demonstrated.<BR>Especially the wedding scene comes across just weird and inappropriate - not only could makeup made Diana (and the others for that matter) look a lot better than the old women she is in the film, but the whole wedding dialog is so embarrassing with Picard cracking jokes noone can laugh about and him playing the entertainer instead of conveying the usual authoritative distinctiveness that suits him and his role so well. <BR>Speaking of emotions: the whole movie is drenched with melancholy and pessimism. Where is the optimistic StarTrek view on the world, where are the ever puzzling technical inventions and ingenuities of Geordi and the irrefutable logic of Data, who this time just sit there contributing nothing constructive to the plot (except his ultimate and utterly destructive sacrifice - the sacrifice of a character to make the film finally interesting).<BR>The film's dark and sinister atmosphere conveys a permanent feeling of hopelessness and bears a striking resemblance to the latest &quot;Enterprise&quot; TV episodes.<BR>All in all, this movie, maybe because of his mission being named the &quot;Nemesis&quot;, the End of the World, gradually dismantles the shining Roddenberry StarTrek vision and forgets about all the creative potential it once had to offer. Just like the recent &quot;Enterprise&quot; TV episodes, it makes a once colorful, mysterious and idealistic fantasy StarTrek universe - although technically advanced - degrade to yet another everyday world just as the one we already have on our doorstep.<BR>Roddenberry died years ago, and now did his vision.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I love this movie, but everybody, just wait until they bring out Kill Bill 1 and 2 together on DVD, uncut... waste of money to buy this one or the 2nd one seperate. Common sense, people.
B000001EL7|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, this is the last great Kiss album, and you should stop here.  I know that hardcore Kiss fans as opposed to casual ones like myself, get everything in the Kiss discography(and then some), but I'm directing this review at the curious ones.  This album, and all previous ones are Kiss in their prime before the image came before the music.  At the time this came out, Kiss were already on top of the world.  Sure, it's a bit poppier than the early albums, but it's still classic Kiss.  It's full of that hard rock sound we've come to expect from them, as well as those thought-provoking, deep, philosophical lyrics like, \\"You pull the trigger on my Love Gun\\".  The cover's cool too.  The band looks Conan-esque, like something off of the cover of a Robert E. Howard novel.  If you're a newcomer, you're not required to start here, but definitely stop here.......unless you become real hardcore.
B00000IPAX|4.0|It's, for lack of a better word, amusing how people only tend to focus on whether a group has allegedly &quot;OMGZ SOLD OUT&quot; or &quot;GoNe NoN-PuNk!!!111&quot; on most of their CD reviews.  My first question to you is, do you know Blink 182?  Do you know Good Charlotte?  Do you know Avril Lavigne?  I didn't think so.  Moving on to my album review (after all, that is what these are supposed to be).<br />Enema of the State has been a frequently played album in my collection for over three years.  I'll say it loud and proud, I like Blink 182.  They have a mass appeal.  To say they're intended only for &quot;immature, pimply, confused prepubescent junior high kids&quot; couldn't be any further from the truth.  I'm a 17-year-old high school senior that could very well be the antonym of the aforementioned adjectives.  <br />Like I've said about 'Take Off Your Pants And Jacket' and other Blink CDs: There really is no boring moment.  The songs, although at times too short (that's why I docked off a star), are awesome!  Highlights include &quot;Don't Leave Me&quot;, &quot;Going Away To College&quot; (which I find to be sad), &quot;Adam's Song&quot; and &quot;Anthem&quot;.  Check out &quot;Anthem Part II&quot; on the 'Take Off Your Pants and Jacket' album.  <br />My best advice to you regarding Blink 182 is to listen with an open mind.  Forget any stereotypes that you may have of them being an immature band intended only for junior high kids.  All jaded 'poser' issues asside, and hey - you may be pleasantly surprised by the things you hear.
B000089CJI|5.0|I love all types of music with grunge alternative topping the list. With all of the garbage out there right now, this CD was a relief. I first heard District Sleeps Alone at Night on launch. I was at work and it popped up and it sounded good so I made it a favorite. I then heard another couple of songs by them and decided to go ahead and order. This CD is an excellent mix of electronica/techno. It's tunes make me feel like I'm floating in the sky. It makes me want stop what I'm doing and just get up and move my body while my eyes are closed so that I can just get lost in the euphoria of it's sound. It makes me forget everything else and just enjoy the moment. It's not too loud, not too soft. Mellow, yet makes you want to get up and dance. I suggest this CD to everyone. Especially those liking Electronica, techno, or industry music.
B0001932ZA|5.0|For those of you wondering about this DVD...this is a good transfer of a good Arnold film. But what  needs to be brought to everyone's attention is one of the two documentaries that are included in this DVD set. It is entitled &quot;Lockdown On Main Street&quot;. It's a 30 minute documentary that examines in full detail the loss of civil rights within the U.S. post 9/11. It literally breaks down both the Patriot Act and the Patriot Act 2 and fully illustrates how it has utterly diminished the 4th Amendment. I'm sure, for many people, this will be the first real education they've ever had on these two Acts that supposedly &quot;save us&quot; from terrorism. It is of great merit that the producers of this DVD had the courage to include this documentary in the new release. So, whether you like this film or not, I highly reccomend either buying it or renting it just for this passionate and educational feature, no matter how disturbing it may be to watch. I'd also try watching it as soon as you can. Big Brother and the Firefighters might see to it that the distribution of this DVD is stopped once they realize how powerful &quot;Lockdown On Main Street&quot; really is.
B0000797IO|4.0|That's the problem. Once you've watched an actress in a weekly show for 10 years (and then watched it a zillion times after that!) you find they can no longer play any other character. The only differences between Rachel & Justine, is that one has a sometimes tedious southern/Texas drawl (can't decide which it wants to be), and the other is very posh! OK, maybe Rachel isn't that posh.<br />Jennifer Aniston also performed her first sex scene in this movie. OK, it's hardly a lot - you can't see anything, and Brad apparently told her to \\"go easy\\" on Jake Gyllenhaal! It does come across as the awkward first time sex with someone, and that does come across well.<br />Justine does come across as quite a selfish character in the movie. She drops Holden in it at the end of the movie, and when her 'friend' Gwen goes into hospital, instead of staying with her, she goes to meet Holden. In the movie, it never came across as Gwen & Justine being that great friends, they were work colleagues, nothing more. Of course you're gonna go off with a cute guy if you're gagging for it! If it was your best, best friend, then maybe you'd stay at the hospital. This is all put into perspective when Justine discovers Gwen has died. She starts pulling away from Holden at this point, and almost seems to resent him because she died.<br />I didn't really like Jake's character, Holden in this. He was nice enough at the start, and actually looked quite cute! He played a very similar character to Donnie in Donnie Darko. But halfway through, at the same point as when Gwen died (and perhaps even before then) he becomes extremely clingy and possessive of Justine. She comes across as his first true love, but the OTT possessiveness is enough to make any girl back off!<br />This film is always described as being hilarious, and a comedy. Am I the only one who didn't find that? I found it more of a drama than anything. It was extremely powerful, thought-provoking, and very sad. The finale was a bit disappointing, but I was rooting for them to stay together. I always do! I suppose every relationship goes a bit stale after a while, as Justine's and her husband's has, so the same probably would have happened with Justine & Holden.<br />I also noticed in one scene, when Bubba and Phil are sitting watching TV, they are actually watching the sickest cartoon ever, Happy Tree Friends.ointing, but I was rooting for them to stay together. I always do! I suppose every relationship goes a bit stale after a while, as Justine's and her husband's has, so the same probably would have happened with Justine & Holden. <br />I also noticed in one scene, when Bubba and Phil are sitting watching TV, they are actually watching the sickest cartoon ever, Happy Tree Friends.
B000002BQK|5.0|I don't think there has ever been an album that I've come across in my entire life that has effected me quite like Mariah's 'Butterfly'.  This album shaped who I became.  It helped me out in my life while I was going through a difficult time.  I was a young teenager when this album was released and it MADE me.  The title track 'Butterfly' is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and it is one of those songs that has changed my life.  The single 'Honey' is a fast paced song featuring Puff Daddy and Mase.  There are 2 outstanding tracks near the end of this album as well, 'Close My Eyes' and 'Outside'.  They show Mariah's vocal capability very well and showcase her song writing ability.  This is a nice mix of classic Mariah and the more &quot;flavourable&quot; Mariah.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Mariah or her voice.<br />Best Ballads:  My All, Butterfly<BR>Best Songs:  Breakdown, Outside, The Roof
B0000089A1|4.0|Most of the album &quot;Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround&quot; deals the cynicism of the music-business; as always there is a good portion of humour in Ray Davies` lyrics.<br />My favourites on this album though, are amongs the songs that do not directly refer to the music business.<br />&quot;Get Back in the Line&quot; is outstanding - I`ll never forget my delight when the band played the song in Viborg ( Denmark ) back in 1974. Other favourites are &quot;This Time Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;A Long Way From Home&quot; and Dave`s &quot;Strangers&quot;.<br />And of course the two hits &quot;Lola&quot; and &quot;Apeman&quot;<br />Unfortunately there are only 3 bonus-tracks here. The single versions of &quot;Lola&quot; and &quot;Apeman&quot; ( rougher Danish single release) are logic additions, but it would have been nice if there had been some previously unreleased tracks, or some from &quot;The Great Lost Kinks Album&quot;.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I don't care what the critics or reviewers say:  this is a good album.  Sarah sounds great and her lyrics are touching as always.  Highlights include: World On Fire, Stupid and Train Wreck.  All the songs have their own unique Sarah touch to it and I think any Sarah fan will thoroughly enjoy it.
B00007J36V|4.0|As Ashley Hutchings says in the notes, this 3rd Fairport album contains various different styles that somehow, by luck?, hang very well together.<br />It`s an album that ends the beginning era of the band. With the following album &quot;Liege and Leaf&quot;, also released in 1969, Fairport Convention established themselves as pioneers of English folk rock.<br />On the this album there are still clear influences from American country, pop and rock`n roll. Songs like &quot;Cajun Woman&quot; and &quot;Million Dollar Bash&quot; would not have fitted later Fairport releases.<br />This is an album of transition. The last to feature drummer Martin Lamble, who sadly was killed in a car-accident, and singer Ian Matthews.<br />Longtime member Dave Swarbrick appears here for the first time, though only as studio musician on four songs. But his influence cannot be overrated; check out &quot;A Sailor`s Life&quot; . New drummer Dave Mattacks also appears for the first time, though only on one of the bonus tracks, which is actually an outtake from &quot;Liege and Leaf&quot;<br />Sandy Denny contributes classics like &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes&quot; and &quot;Autopsy&quot;.<br />Richard Thompson`s best song here is &quot;Genesis Hall&quot;.<br />My favourite is Dylan`s &quot;Percy Song&quot; with it`s beautiful vocals and great building up!<br />The band`s only hit record &quot;Si Tu Dois Partir&quot; is also there. It?s a free-and-easy cover of Dylan`s &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot;<br />Both bonus tracks a good, fit the rest of the album fine!
B000000WCA|5.0|I don't care what anyone says:  this album is FUN.  It was one of the first CDs I ever bought and it still remains to be one of my favourites.  It's so fun to play it and think back at all the fun memories of my earlier days.  Great, fun pop music that pop these days does NOT deliver.
0385334206|1.0|This may sound like the kind of frothing review written by somebody who never read the book, but who dislikes the author and gives a bad review on principle; this isn't the case. I liked Vonnegut when I picked up this novel, on account of the much better Cat's Cradle and Mother Night, but after reading Breakfast I began to change my mind. <br />I don't think people should be able to get away with writing books like this.<br />It's self-indulgent. It's heavy-handed, smug, obnoxious and fatuous; even if I agreed with Vonnegut completley, I don't think I would be able to stomach it. His philosophy is presented as a matter of fact, in short, self-satisfied bursts of introspection, while characters from his other novels blunder around pointlessly - but what separates this novel from some existentialist or surrealist masterpiece is the disgusting, homespun sentimentality evident on every single page. It's a grand combination of nonsense and mawkishness, peppered, just for the heck of it apparently, with the tons of 'cute' sexual references and the occasional obscene drawing. Because Vonnegut himself is such an overbearing presence in the novel, I found myself hating him personally when I had finished it. Please, please don't buy this book; bury the abberation, don't let other authors think that this is what the novel has become.
B000000WFF|4.0|Spice Girls are one of those groups that even if you're a hardcore rocker you HAVE to love it.  I enjoyed this album very much.  It's fun to listen to.  Spice Girls never fail to produce wonderful pop/dance music to listen to when you want to just relax in your room or with a couple of friends.  A GREAT cd to do karoake to as well.  Favourites- 'Denying', 'Viva Forever', 'Too Much' and 'Do It'
B000084T18|5.0|I read some of the reviews on this website and I did not agree with them at all, even though I do respect other people's opinions. This CD is one of the best that I have heard in a while. Most artists release really good singles, so you buy the CD and realize the only reason those singles that made you bounce were the only ones released is because the rest of the CD is GARBAGE!. I like every song on the CD. My favorite is What Up Gangsta. The beats are incredible and not sampled from the 70's like other artists do. The main song that sticks out in my mind is Many Men. The song lets you know that the &quot;Thug Life&quot; is real. I also like Back Down cause he seriously puts Ja Rule on blast. I love 50, he's one of the coldest out there, hell he's being compared to 2Pac. To anyone that reads this, GO COP THE CD NOW!!!!!!!!!!
B00008J4P5|1.0|I'm so glad I only borrowed this CD - It really sucks. I heard the track Seven Nation Army and thought it was okay but then I heard the rest of the CD and its a load of codwallaping CRAP!!!!!!!! <BR>       They are so untalented and I can't believe this album ever hit the shop shelf. If you're thinking of buying it do yourself a favour and don't - it's a waste of money and time.<BR>       Jack White has an anger problem and I'm glad he got sentenced to anger management - he really deserved it!
B000088E6D|5.0|We saw Michael Buble in concert last night in Palm Springs and fell in love with him. You know the old story - friends convinced us to go, and are we glad we did.<BR>He sang many of the songs on this cd, and some I would love to hear on his next one. We also want the new DVD expected out any day.<BR>If I was now asked to describe what Buble does, I'd have to say   ' mood  music  ' specialist. Why? Look at all our grins this morning, you'll know why.<BR>He is a Love Messenger who knows how to do send the right message!!!!<br />How often to you buy a cd and don't recognize the performer live? Buble is as good live as he is recorded. The cd is excellent, and Buble better!<BR>Couldn't choose one 'best' from the 13 tracks, but Sway and The Way You Look Tonight are worth their weight in gold.
0062502182|5.0|After reading The Alchemist several years ago, I recently reread it, and found that it is one of those few books that has the power to change your life every time you read it. What I find so marvelous about this book is that it can be read on many different levels: younger readers could enjoy the fairy-tale adventure of Santiago as he seeks out his treasure, whereas older readers pick up on the extended allegory woven into the novel. Every page is rich with symbolism and hidden threads of meaning.<BR>       What is so very brilliant about this book is that it has the ability to take one of its messages and connect it macrocosmically with the very structure of the novel. One of Coelho's main ideas is that omens and signs about one's destiny are scattered throughout life in order to be found, and in the actual novel, Coelho has scattered his own foreshadowing and metaphors in a way that mimics an inherent truth about life. The effect is that the reader learns to have trust in life, and it helps them to believe that when they follow their own Personal Legends, the universe truly does \\"conspire to help them\\" in their endeavors.<BR>       I recently read another novel that seems to reinforce the uplifting theme of pursuing one's destiny where it lies. Sands of the Desert, by Stacy Chudwin, follows the journey of the princess Serepta as she escapes betrothal to her wicked cousin. She journeys through many mysterious lands, and this journey, as I interepreted it, is an intricate allegory as well. Each part of the book (\\"Up a Mountain,\\" \\"Down a Stream,\\" \\"To the Pyramid\\") all seem to represent the successive stages in a person's life. Like Coelho's fable, it also can be read on many levels, which proved to be true when my daughter in eighth grade enjoyed just it as much as I did. The quick paced story held her attention, as did the fact that the author, Chudwin, is only 16 years old! Both The Alchemist and Sands of the Desert seem to have the ability to take universal themesabout destiny and truth and deliver them with a rich, imaginative plot. I would highly recommend them both.
B000089RVX|3.0|This band is ok at best. The lead singer can really sing and she is very attractive too. &quot;Going Under&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; are pretty decent songs. &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; would have been a better song if that male rapper wasn't in it. It makes the song sound like a bad Linkin Park rip-off. I suggest picking this up if mainstream music is your thing.<br />Oh yeah, I heard the guitarist left to play for Avril Lavigne. What a jerk-off.
B000002KGT|5.0|Well here we are. It's 2004. Sounds weird doesn't it? I thought long and hard about what should be the first classic cut of 2004. Many came to mind... I mean think of how many classic albums there are out there. <br />But it was Fleetwood Mac's Rumours I decided upon.... one of the many reasons being that the holidays and new year are often a time of turmoil for many wondering just what to do.... buying gifts etc.. and no album in my mind came out better with so much turmoil going on. Drugs are often in the picture with just about any band that was interesting enough for Behind The Music. With Fleetwood Mac however drugs are only part of the story. Inter-band breakups were going on with members of the band, sleeping around.... I mean the band wasn't even talking to each other. <BR>And look at the album we got from them all of these things aside. &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; and &quot;Don't Stop&quot; especially have become rock and pop classics. The impeccable musicianship and production on this album makes me think about how sorely lacking some of today's bands are. Sure many of today's band's albums have highly polished, huge sounding albums  but... you strip it down and there is nothing there. I am more inclined to give their producers credit in that kind of situation. What I'm talking about is passion and pure talent .... things that Fleetwood Mac had in abundance.  <br />Many of you likely remember Hole's cover of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; that came out a few years back from the The Crow: City Of Angels Soundtrack... well think about the similarities between Courtney Love and Stevie Nicks..... coincidence I think not. Fleetwood Mac's influence is certainly underrated. Anyhow toss on Rumours and rock and roll baby.

B000001IPL|5.0|Along with Green Day's Dookie, The Offspring's Smash helped bring punk back into the mainstream by blurring the lines between punk,rock and pop. Dookie and Smash have more in common than many realize. Sonically there are similarities obviously but let's face it Dexter Holland and Billie Joe Armstrong sound nothing alike. Both bands used a sense of humour to great advantage. Alot of the subject matter was similar.Both Green Day's &quot;Basketcase&quot; and The Offspring's &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; were anthems for the paraniod. The self depreciating &quot;Self Esteem&quot; and Green Day's &quot;Longview&quot; are probably two of the nineties most related-to songs ....both which are essential inclusions on any nineties best of mix. <BR>  <BR>But all things considered there were a few differences between the two aswell.The Offspring were certainly more diverse.With everything from ska rockers (&quot;What Happened To You&quot;) to riff rock (&quot;Come Out And Play&quot;) Smash seems to push the envelope a little more .Besides who could forget the hardcore cuss up of &quot;Bad Habit&quot;. That song alone probably had thousands of parents screaming at their kids &quot;what in the hell are you listening to?&quot;. Although The Offspring never really did duplicate the success of Smash they did have a few other hit singles (&quot;Pretty Fly For A White Guy&quot;,&quot;Why Don't You Get A Job&quot; and more recently &quot;Hit That&quot;.... and with their sense of humour intact no less.
0385504209|5.0|I have heard many friends rave about this book but honestly didn't think that I would find it interesting, not my type of book. Or so I thought, I started it at 4 o'clock pm and couldn't put it down until I finished it at ten thirty that night. A fantastic read that I suggest to any who like to have their intelligence tweaked! Also love how he weaves truth of our very real world into his books. Have to respect the amount of research he must have done to write the book. Bravo to Dan Brown!!!
B000000OQF|5.0|I wish I could say that the new Guns N Roses album is out but sadly I cannot. So I felt I would talk about the album that started it all for the guns in Appetite For Destruction. The new Guns N Roses album has been ten years in the making. <br />TEN LONG YEARS!!!! So as we continue to wait for the new album I figured I would slam back a couple beers and reflect on the now sixteen year old Appetite For Destruction. That's right. SIXTEEN YEARS OLD!!!!  <br />I'd have to say that Appetite For Destruction is my absolute favorite rock album of all time. I love alot of albums... but Appetite is dearest to my heart. Appetite is everything a great rock and roll album should be. Kick ass rock and roll tunes from beginning to end delivered with dangerous authenticity and conviction. Every song is a classic on Appetite.No song has ever opened an album and summed up the band so well as &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot;. Guns N Roses are the poster boys for a rebellious, bad ass rock band and &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot; was their first message to the world. <br />Then there is &quot;Paradise City&quot; one of the greatest rock anthems of all time and ofcourse the song that really launched the band into the mainstream &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot;. This is only the beggining. There is also the swaggering heroin anthem &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot;, the venomous &quot;It's So Easy&quot;, and the locomotive like rock of &quot;Nightrain&quot;. Add in every other song on the album kicking just as much ass. GNR had it all. Axl Rose's unmistakable sandpapery rasp, Slash and Izzy's Rolling Stones on steroids riffs. Duff Mckagan's thundering bass work and the forceful drumming of Steven Adler. I love Lies, Use Your Illusion 1&amp;2, and even The Spaghetti Incident? But Appetite For Destruction remains a high water point for hard rock that has yet to be topped in my opinion.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|i finally saw alicia keys live during the ladies first tour with beyonce, and i LOVED her.  out of all 4 acts, she was definitely the best.  her voice is beautiful and her piano playing talent is remarkable. she has it all. i didn't have any of alicia keys cd's (although i did like &quot;fallin'&quot; off her first cd) but the day following the concert i went out and bought &quot;Diary of Alicia Keys&quot;. I have never seen such talent....she was definitely the best act and i think that says a lot when you're performing with artrists like Beyonce, Missy Elliott, and Tamia.  She's one of a kind!
B000003TA4|5.0|Grab a pint, toss in Nirvana's Nevermind and read on.  <br />If there is one album in the last fifteen years that has had a huge impact on music and is regarded as a classic it would have to be Nirvana's Nevermind. As of this writing the album is twelve years old. <br />Propelled by the massive success of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" Nevermind took the world by storm. Nirvana and the other so called grunge rockers put an end to hair metal pretty quickly. Instead of sexually or fantasy driven lyrics Nirvana used cryptic poetry. Instead of leather jackets they wore flannel.Instead of guitar solos they used feedback. Yes, Nirvana had solos but none that would be compared to the over the top fretboard acrobatics of the shedders they left in their dust.  <br />If anyone still wonders why Nirvana was so successful let me clear it up for you. Not only did Kurt Cobain write some of the greatest,catchiest and melodic songs of well ...ever ...he possesed a powerfully emotive voice and sang every word with conviction. Even if you didn't know what he was saying you understood the feeling he was conveying. <br />Some people didn't believe that Nirvana were good musicians. I believe it takes alot of talent to write a great song.While they may not play guitar like Eddie Van Halen or bang the drums like John Bonham yet they've probably had just as much influence on modern music as either one. Infact no album since Van Halen and Led Zepplin in my eyes has influenced more people to pick up an instrument. <br />Sometimes less is more.
B0000024LN|5.0|I bought this cd, put it in, and listen to the whold thing without stopping for a second. This is the only cd I can listen to without skipping any tracks. Redman is sick, his lyrics are dope, amazing how he puts them all together. To all you other whack rappers out there listen to Red &quot;you remind me of school on a Sunday...no class!&quot;
B000006TRV|5.0|How could one write a column on classic albums and not include Pink Floyd? Responsible for not only The Wall but Dark Side Of The Moon, Animals and Wish You Were Here..... <br />I'd have to be a COMPLETE moron to not write about Pink Floyd in Classic Cuts. <BR>  <BR>The Wall was released in 1979.It was a concept album about the tortured life of a rock star named Pink Floyd. Along with The Who's Tommy, The Wall is one of the most popular concept albums of all time. More people probably dropped acid to Pink Floyd than just about anybody this side of Jimi Hendrix... but acid or not just about everybody loved this album. It doesn't take a hot of acid to recognize the anthemic quality of &quot;Another Brick In The Wall (part 2)&quot; or the masterful songwriting of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. <BR>  <BR>Everyone from Guns N Roses to Kittie to Tom Morello of Audioslave / Rage Against The Machine and Layne Staley of Alice In Chains have performed songs from this album. What would a rock station be without &quot;Hey You&quot;, &quot;Another Brick In The Wall (Part 2)&quot;, &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;? It's nice to be able to throw on an album and listen to it from start to finish ....something that was once commonplace but could be painful today. These days it's surprising to hear three good songs on a record. <BR>  <BR>It's sad really... but the industry has changed.It's obviously less about substance and music and more about marketing and good looks. Chances are if Pink Floyd had formed even in the nineties they never would have been signed.But lucky for us it hasn't always been that way. <BR>  <BR>So throw on The Wall and enjoy all of those old memories... but be careful ....those acid flashbacks are a doozy.
B000007R0S|5.0|This Album sounded awesome on DVD - which until recently was only way you could enjoy enjoy this CD in 5.1 surround.  The DTS CD mix transfers the majority of the songs from the DVD to the audio CD format perfectly perserving the 5.1 arrangements of each song.  Also included is a bonus 5.1 version of Seven Bridges Road in which each vocalist in the band is given a speaker (assuming you have a DTS decoder) and the vocals wrap around the listener.  This is as close as you can get to seeing the Eagles in concert without leaving your favorite chair.<br />If you do not have a DTS decoder, you can always purchase the standard version of the album, which contains most of the same songs in stereo.  Once key difference is that the stereo version on the album lacks Seven Bridges Road.  Also, where as the DTS Surround version is completely recorded live from beginning to end, the stereo version features studio version of several songs.
B000002INR|4.0|I'm sure some of you out there are asking ...has Kasey lost his mind? ...a hair metal band with a classic cut?  <br />But truth be told here people Skid Row's debut album represents everything that was good about eighties rock. From the bulletproof voice of lead vocalist Sebastian Bach to the lightning fast guitar solos of guitarists Dave &quot;Snake&quot; Sabo and Scotti Hill, Skid Row proved from the get go that they meant business. <BR>  <BR>Kicked off with the rowdy one two punch of &quot;Big Guns&quot; and &quot;Sweet Little Sister&quot; Skid Row's debut was easily one of the best and in my eyes most genuine albums of the eighties rock genre. Lead Vocalist Sebastian Bach could not only sing circles around just about anyone... he had the x factor in conviction because the material was lived in... which much music of the time lacked.You believed that Bach and the boys were the &quot;Youth Gone Wild&quot; because plain and simple they were. Even on  power ballads  &quot;I Remember You&quot; and the &quot;guns don't kill people f**ked up  teenagers kill people&quot; anthem &quot;18&amp;Life&quot; Skid Row had an authenticity that few could touch... with the exception of maybe Guns N Roses and Motley Crue. <BR>  <BR>Unfortunatly for Skid Row the band would only release one more album of original material with Sebastian Bach on lead vocals. It really is a shame because altough Skid Row had a good run... it could have been longer and we needed them more than ever in the late nineties. Now Sebastian is singing on broadway while Skid Row is continuing on with a new singer.Rumour had it that Sebastian was one of the singers  considered for Velvet Revolver ....the  band that contains three former member of Guns N Roses ....now that would have been a rock band.
B00008AWOD|3.0|It feels a bit weird writing a review for this album, prely because it was this album that turned me off of Placebo.<br />well...<br />It's not a *bad* album perse... it's just not good.  Background info: I've been a Placebo fan since 1998, swept up in the \\"Without You I'm Nothing\\" haze and the common 13-year-old \\"ooo... pretty boy!\\" mindset.  And it wasn't unjustified.  Mr. Molko was in his make-up drenched, long-haired heyday, writing quirky pop songs with the subtle dementia and histrionic ambivalence characteristic of many great post-punk bands (as well as many great bands of all kinds).  The first album is essentially bursting out of the seems; energetic and defiant pop music with a camp edge, which was a breath of fresh air amongst the earnest drone of some many bands of the era.  The music was fresh and alive... it had a life all its own and embodied a world of drugs, sex, and an acute existential awareness and expressiveness as affected by drugs and sex, all filtered thru the corpse of camp rock n' roll.  Then came Without You I'm Nothing.  A wonderful album.  Probably their best.  Much darker and slightly ethereal - strangely imperminent, as if the same thoughts in the brilliant minds giving us the first album were twisted and contorted in fun-house mirrors and dizzied by the fumes of black nail varnish.  A beautiful and evokative album by all accounts (I still think \\"your smile would make me sneeze/ when we were Siamese\\" is one of the best lines ever).<br />That was the end of an era.  Black Market Music followed suit, bringing them tons of new fans, but showing an \\"aging\\" (for lack of a better term, though seems akward considering most of the music I listen to is courtesy old or dead people) Placebo.  The artistic and intellectual vision and intensity of the previous two albums was lacking, but it was (and is... why the hell am I using past tense?  oh well) still a wonderful album, despite its often confessional nature.  But there was still a spark, a certain intangible something, and the album seemed to create a life (albeit a slightly more boring life).<br />So along comes Sleeping With Ghosts.  When news of the album hit the internet, I was thrilled... just the title of the album is genius... it sums up so much of what I feel (see the old/dead musicians comment above) and what I felt Placebo's early music possessed.  So, I bought the album expecting MY Placebo to be back.  So wrong.  The album is drenched in mundane filler, as if, in the process of aging, their souls died or decayed or something.  The album possesses no soul, no spark, nothing... no expression or life, only a trail of sad confessions and \\"used to be\\"s.  The lyrics are vapid and one dimensional (\\"this happened to me... it was bad... be sad\\" sums up most of the songs) in meaning, not to mention the almost complete lack of word play and logic twists that once defined Placebo.  The music is also bland alterna-rock BS... very few of the awkward rhythms and interplay of yore, much more straight-forward, well, alterna-rock.  <br />And no, I don't dislike the album because they changed... Many bands change and do it well (they manage to change their style while maintaining a universal spark of some sort), and even Without You I'm Nothing is quite different from the self-titled.  I dislike this album not because the style is different, but because there's nothing there to define Placebo... nothing to give the album life.  That being said, \\"This Picture', \\"Sleeping With Ghosts', and \\"Special Needs\\" ARE great songs.  The only problem is, they're the only great songs on the album, and only 2 or 3 other songs are even good (to be honest, half the album is unlistenable garbage... what the hell is \\"Plasticine\\"?).<br />I'm giving the album 3 stars just because I can't bear to give them lower... they were once one of my favorite bands, and may be again.  We'll see what happens with the next album.
B000002H97|4.0|With the release of \\"St.Anger\\", the brand new album from Metallica, I felt that this time around I would take the time to talk about the album that made Metallica superstars.<BR> <BR>Referred to by most as \\"the black album\\" for it's ultra-noir cover Metallica's self titled album is one of the absolute best albums to come out of the nineties and is going to live on as an all time classic for generations to come. It's hard to believe this album is over 12 years old now. I mean when this album came out hardly anyone outside of Seattle and the surrounding areas had heard of Kurt Cobain and his band Nirvana, saying someone was grungy was thought to be an insult and Guns N' Roses was the biggest band on the planet. <BR>The album spawned many mega hits that have become staples of rock radio including the monsterous \\"Enter Sandman\\"and the headbanging riff rocker \\"Sad But True\\". But to the surprise of many the band also churned out two power ballad hits in \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" and \\"The Unforgiven\\". This is one of those albums you can throw on at a party and whether the person likes Eminem or Willie Nelson they'll go \\"I love this song\\". What I mean is this album is universal ....it applies to people of all walks of life. With good reason I might add...every song on this record is pure gold. <br />Bob Rock's production is some of the best in recent memory. Having worked with Bon Jovi and Motley Crue, Rock helped Metallica get the massive sound that in my opinion was lacking on earlier albums. To be honest I wish Bob Rock had produced \\"Kill Em All\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Ride The Lightning\\" and also \\"And Justice For All\\" because all of those albums have some amazing material and are classics in their own right but lack the masterful production that Rock brought to \\"the black album\\". <br />Throw this one in and remind yourself how much you love it.
B0001932ZA|1.0|Better luck Artisan Entertainment.   Please remaster this title again.   This has got to be the worst widescreen transfer on DVD.  The print used for this SE looks like it was the same one used on the bare bones edition DVD.   There is alot of pronounced grain and muddyness throughout.   I think the  person who had the two pan and scan discs had a defective version.  There is a anamorphi widescreen version.  But it is a really bad print.  Also, Artisan, Please go back and put the DTS audio on this disc.   There is no DTS there.   When I selected the DTS option, there was no DTS trailer at the beginning of the feature.   Having the DTS trailer there is a hallmark of quaility.  Instead my player played the sound in Dolby SR stereo.   This DVD falls below the DVD's you have put out in the past.  This is a tranfer that falls short of expectations.   This disc needs to be recalled.  I fully intend to return this disc and get a refund.
B000002A6O|5.0|You've waited. You've begged. You've pleaded. Have no fear Classic Cut is  here! I think it's safe to say Bat Out Of Hell is the best album ever made by a man who took his stage name from a food product. I know what your thinking ...and Eminem doesn't count.... ( M&amp;M, get it? )<br />If there is one word to describe the sound of Meat Loaf I think epic would be it. Three of the album's tracks run over eight minutes in length so I think it is particularly apt. But length aside epic would be the word. Meatloaf's (or would it be Meat Loaves?) over the top voice and Jim Steinman's orchestral like arrangements sound huge even by todays standards .... no small feat considering the album was released in 1977 ....thats right Bat Out Of Hell is over twenty five years old.  <BR>  <BR>It's hard to resist the grandiose title track &quot;Bat Out Of Hell&quot; or the bouncy &quot;Paradise By The Dashboard Light&quot;(how much fun is it to have All Star shortstop and commentator Phil Rizzuto commentating the dashboard escapades&quot;?). The same is true for the ever popular half full ballad &quot;Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad&quot; and the other classics that compose this album. Bat Out Of Hell is just such an extravagant, ambitious album it's mind boggling. Meatloaf's voice is so powerful I envision a glass breaking everytime I hear him sing. I cannot think of any album that sounds as monsterous arrangement wise as Bat Out Of Hell. Not only was Meat Loaf much more fun that many of their competitors they were often much more musical. <br />Bat Out Of Hell is a brilliant record from beginning to end brimming with artistic genius and incredible musicianship. Props must be given to Todd Rundgren for his stunning production aswell. Maybe not quite as influential as some of the other classic cuts, I believe Bat Out Of Hell is still quite an underrated album. Many may acknowledge it as a classic but there should be many more. Sometimes .... ok ...alot of times I just don't understand themusic industry. Britney Spears gets props and not Meatloaf ....what's wrong with this picture.  Oh well, I suppose we can all take comfort in the fact that Britney Spear's will never have an album featured in Classic Cuts ..... that I promise you.
0385504209|3.0|The puzzle: easy.  The writing: not too bad.  The premise: old news.<br />However, if you've never encountered the actual history of the Catholic Church or noticed the extreme anti-woman ideology of Christianity, this book might lead you to further questioning and research of your own.  Independent thought is frightening and difficult (witness the wailing and gnashing of teeth in many of the &quot;reviews&quot; so far); if this mediocre book encourages even one person to Google something new, then more power to it.
B000002MP2|4.0|To date Green Day's Dookie is the newest album to become a classic cut... and with good reason. Released in 1994, Dookie was just one of those albums that just about everybody seemed to like.Fans of Salt and Pepa and TLC were headbanging along with fans of Nirvana and The Sex Pistols. It takes one hell of an album to unite these two tribes so let's take a look. <BR>  <BR>I think plain and simple these songs are just too damn catchy for anyone to deny.I  mean \\"Basketcase\\" and \\"Welcome To Paradise\\" are .... like most Green Day songs just pure fun. Every teenager could relate to \\"Longview\\". Even soccer mom's liked \\"When I Come Around\\". Although it can be dangerous for mom's and kids to like the same music... for some reason in this case it worked.Dookie is a great example of simple, catchy songs that get straight to the point. Regardless of what anyone says I believe Billie Joe Armstong is one of the best songwriters of the nineties ....I mean this guy knows how to write a hook. Just about every beginning guitarist would learn Green Day as one of their first songs for years to come ....a sign of a truely great guitar record no matter how basic. <BR>  <BR>Dookie is one of the most essential albums of the nineties without a doubt. I'd have to say it is one of the albums that most defines the sound of the nineties aswell. Obviously less so than Nirvana's Nevermind or Pearl Jam's Ten ... and probably any Alice In Chains album but think about it ...would there have been a Blink 182 or a Sum 41 without Green Day. Even newer bands like  Simple Plan and Good Charlotte owe a whole helluva lot to Green Day.Of course Green Day owes alot to The Sex Pistols and The Buzzcocks but hey everybody has to have roots.With \\"Longview\\" I think the band may have written one of the catchiest bass lines in the history of mankind.  <BR>  <BR>It's not like Green Day dropped off the face of the planet after this album either like so many from the same time period.Their next album Insomniac spawnedthe hits \\"Geek Stink Breath\\", \\"Brainstew\\" and \\"Walking Contradiction\\". Their album Nimrod would have hits with \\"Hitchin' a Ride\\" \\"Nice Guys Finish Last\\" and probably their biggest hit \\"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life). The train kept a rollin with their album Warning in which the band had hits with the title track and \\"Minority\\". The band followed Warning with International  Superhits their greatest hits album.... wow isn't too many bands from the nineties that have one of those now is there?
B00005JLIU|5.0|When I was very young, I saw this movie on television when it was aired very late at night. It was way past my bedtime and had missed the beginning, but I was drawn in by the campiness of this movie and had to watch the whole thing. The next morning I had to go to school (college) and I was remarking to a classmate of mine about this really funny film that was so sixties about the twenties. He made an audible gasp, this was before the phrase &quot;Drama Queen,&quot; which he was and still is, and asked me about certain parts of the film. He hadn't seen it in years and told me the title. Well, at that point I had to find this movie on tape, I'm embarrased to say laser disc hadn't been invented yet. I found a used vhs copy and played the thing to death. I recieved the laser disc copy as a birthday gift, the transfer isn't much to brag about but the introduction and intermission had been restored as it is still.  I bought the dvd version not too long ago and the picture is cleaner but like a reviwer stated before me, the picture seems a bit grainy, this is due to the dvd's higher resolution. I think this print is as good as it's gonna get, this movie is 35 plus years old now and for it's age, it's not bad. The slapstick, the silent-movie cards placed at Julie Andrews thoughts, my favorite is her complaining about her full fronts ruining the line of her beads, and the overall sixties interpreting the twenties. Look at the makeup and hairstyles of the extras. Mary Tyler Moore as an airhead and virgin is a delightful step out of character and Carol Channing looking like she had a ball. The great Beatrice Lilly and her henchmen Jack Soo and Pat Morita spewing fake Chinese &quot;Oh, Pook!&quot; Opium Dens and fireworks, it's all here beautifully choreographed and scored, fun!!!
B000002J09|5.0|Here we are.A lmost Christmas and I haven't even started my shopping yet. I'll probably get around to it on Christmas Eve ( or shop online here at Amazon ) when you have to duke it out to some other procrastinator for even the worst of gifts. But here is a gift to all of you ...Led Zeppelin's IV. <br />Often referred to as Zoso, Led Zeppelin's fourth album is often regrded as their masterpiece. If you ask me every Led Zeppelin album is a masterpiece and worthy of classic cut status. I understand this however. I mean this is the album that contains the most played fm rock song of all time (&quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;) ....not to mention some of Led Zeppelin's most well known classics (&quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;). <BR>This album ...even more so than other Zeppelin albums seems to have struck a chord with every generation. Every kid that gets into guitar and anyone that has raided their parents record collections have fallen in love with Zeppelin because of this album ....and anybody else who has gotten ahold of this piece of greatness really.  <br />Honestly ....what would the world be without &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;.T hink about it how many graduations and parties has this song made an appearance at? &quot;Stairway&quot; alone has affected and touched so many people it is mind boggling. But &quot;Stairway&quot; aside ...this album is unbelievably good. <br />Zoso is a virtual school of riffs and a bible of great songwriting and musicianship. <br />Listen again...and relieve the experience.
B00012QM8G|2.0|As others have observed, the packaging for this movie is abominable. Furthermore, the extras are nowhere near what is expected of such a monumental work of cinema. No commentary, no trailers; Finding Nemo had better extras than this DVD. I really enjoy this film, but it deserved better than this.
0452282152|4.0|After reading some of the &quot;negative&quot; reviews, let me just re-state the title - &quot;it's fiction&quot;.  If you don't like character studies, a genre in literature many of us learn about in high school, you will not like this book.  Most of Chevalier's books are character studies with mediocre developed plots. She is interested in the psychology of the characters, not necessarily the total historical accuracy of say, Dutch art history.  That is not her focus. I like her books mainly because she is so good at developing characters to the point that reviews state that Griet is &quot;immature&quot; or a &quot;practical tramp&quot;.  This is not a masterpiece of literature, but it is a very good book and an enjoyable read with some umph to it. In comparison, I know many people who enjoyed the DaVinci Code for its action sequences and esoteric presence, but I would not necessarily rate it better or worse than this book for historical accuracy, if that is your pet peeve.  These are not classic works of literature.  Read for enjoyment and use a book like this to spark enough interest to pursue increasing your knowledge-base about Vermeer and Dutch life in the 17th-18th century, if that is what you want to do.<br />I would also recommend the movie, but only as a visually stimulating work, again not &quot;quintessential&quot; film making, but enjoyable from the perspective of framing it like a Vemeer painting (in the eyes of this amateur anyway).
B0000714BP|5.0|Nothing but praise for this great flick! Let's face it, while it may not be a movie that George Bush would ever watch (mind you if he did he could learn a thing or two about love and acceptance). I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to watch a great movie. Even after seeing it over five times I still laugh out loud and get a kick out of all three &quot;ladies&quot;! Robin Williams is hilarious and RuPaul makes a surprise visit! Rent it today and you will be glad you did!
0064407667|4.0|The Bad Beginning<BR>By: Lemony Snicket<BR>Reviewed by: A. Chin<BR>Period 5<br />The Bad Beginning is about three siblings, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire.  The story starts off with the three siblings being at the beach.  While they are there, Mr. Poe, their caretaker, comes and tells them that their parents have just died while their house was on fire.  Violet, Klaus, and Sunny cannot believe this.  They don't seem to believe how it had happened so fast.  The three of them were at the beach, and the next thing they knew was their parents have been died.  Mr. Poe then tells them that they must live in is house for a couple of days until he can find a suitable home for them.  Violet, Klaus, and Sunny soon find themselves living in Count Olaf's home.  The three children hate their new home.  The house is covered with pictures of eyes and everything is dark and gloomy.  Not only that, the three children have to share a tiny room with only one bed in it.  Violet and Klaus take turns sleeping on the bed while Sunny sleeps on a pile of window curtains.  The only great thing about Count Olaf's neighborhood is their next-door neighbor, Justice Strauss.  The children see her as a kind and caring person.  They soon find out that Count Olaf is after the Baudelaires' fortune.  One day, Count Olaf tells Violet that she must marry him or else Sunny will be dropped from the thirty-foot high tower.  Violet has no choice at all but to marry him.  If Violet marries him he will inherit the Baudelaire fortune.  To prevent this from happening, Violet and Klaus must quickly figure out a way to stop Violet from marrying Count Olaf.  On the day of the wedding, Violet is dressed in a dull wedding gown.  When the time comes for her to sign her name on the wedding paper with her own hand, she uses her left hand because she is right-handed.  This means that she did not verify her wedding with Count Olaf legal.  Count Olaf is furious with this and before they know it the lights are turnedoff and the room is pitch-black.  Everyone walks blindly and chaos happens everywhere.  When Violet turns on the lights again Count Olaf and his henchmen are gone.  They have all escaped.  Although Count Olaf and his henchmen have escaped, they will be back to try to steal the Baudelaire fortune once again.  As for now, the Baudelaires' are safe with Mr. Poe. <BR> <BR>I liked this book because it has a nice story plot.  I like it how the story is about these three miserable children.  Although it is sad, it is very interesting.  I like it how the author describes the life of these Baudelaires' and what's going on in their lives.  The author describes how they feel in a very sad way.  One way of showing this is when he wrote, \\"Klaus felt an icy chill go through him as the horrible man spoke.  He had never been so terrified in all his life.  He found that his arms and legs were shaking uncontrollably, as if he were having some sort of fit.  His mouth was making strange sounds, like Sunny always did, as he struggled to find something to say.\\"  This is my first reason of why I like this book. <br />I also liked this book because of the characters and their characteristics.  For example, Violet loves to invent things and Klaus loves to read tons of books.  Sunny likes to bite things as well.  One quote proving this is, \\"Violet had a real knack for inventing and building strange devices, so her brain was often filled with images of pulleys, levers, and gears, and she never wanted to be distracted by something as trivial as her hair.\\"  This is my second reason of why I like this book.<br />My favorite part in the book was when Count Olaf tries to marry Violet.  This is my favorite part because there is a lot of action going on.  During this part, many things are going on at the same time.  For example, when Violet tells Count Olaf that she did not sign with her \\"own hand\\", Count Olaf becomes furious.  Right after he finds out he tells the hook-handed man to drop Sunny from the thirty-foot tower, the hook-handed man has already brought her out from her cage.  Right after that, one of Count Olaf's henchmen turn off the lights of the auditorium.  The entire room is pitch-black.  Nobody can see and everything turns into chaos.  People are running frantically in every direction there is to go.  Violet then is able to find the light switch and turn the lights back on.  When she does, Count Olaf and his henchmen have escaped.  There is a lot of action during this part in the book.  This is why this is my favorite part of the book.
B00005TT77|5.0|Remakes are often a very good change from the original song, but not if you are crazy about the Beatles(think they are the only half good group out there like some people I know...)  There are really good remakes in this CD, all of original beatles songs, and anyone who LIKES the Beatles would enjoy it alot.  If you've seen the movie(it's good too)and liked it you would enjoy this.  And if you like remakes of oldies.  Uh...that's it.
0767817664|5.0|This is a great film and wasn't over done.  It is one of those teen 80's vampire flicks, and is very enjoyable no matter how old you are.  Buy saying no matter how old you are I don't mean let your kids watch it cause it's not for your kids at all.  Chris Sarandon (star of Child's PLay) is great as Charlie.  He maked the movie very enjoyable.  I was a bit younger when I watched this film.  I don't mean like 9 or 10 I was about 23 when this came out and now I'm 42.  The special affects are great and the camera tricks are dazzling and great.  Lot's of nudity in this vampire flick and this one was way better than it's horrible and depressing sequel.  So, just take my word for it, don't go near the sequel.  Anyway, the acting in this gets a 5/5 and the plot gets a 5/5.  Even by looking at the front cover of this movie you can tell that it is a cool and exicting film.  This is the best vampire movie I've seen really, and trust me, I've seen a batch of vampire movies.  Let's say this film hits number 1 because of these three reasons, <BR>1. There is tons of gore<BR>2. It isn't fake looking like alot of other vampire movies<BR>3. It has a great and interesting plot<BR>What more do you need to know that this movie is great and well worth your money no matter what the price is.  SO go ahead and get this movie, take my word for it, you won't regret it.  Not at all.<BR>9/10<BR>Rated R for graphic violence, nudity, coarse language, and some gore.
B00006JKON|5.0|WarChild has kind of a charming offhandedness after the grim Passion Play, but shares many themes (Job considers Calvinism or something like that).  There was no need to stitch the songs together into some overarching narrative like the previous few records so the songs stand on their own merits.  The instrumentation tends toward the cartoonish but the melodies are strong and it all holds up 30 years later.  I enjoy just about everything the &quot;real&quot; Jethro fans hate about this record.  Accordions, silly sax &amp; synth &amp; strings, just a lovely goofy job all the way through, biting lyrics notwithstanding.  Except that awful little tune &quot;Solitaire&quot;, a real lapse of judgment that seems aimed at one the group's print detractors.  There are occasional jarring volume changes and some questionable resort to engineering gee whiz but generally this nutty record hits the bullseye.  Think it got to #2 in the U.S. and there was even a hit single!
B00004XMS0|5.0|This is a great movie and I recomened it too anyone who has ever liked Tim Burton, Batman, or action movies.  So you should think about getting this set.  Some of these films can be dark sometimes but they will always remain entertaining.  Michael Keaton is the best actor for Batman.  George Clooney is a great actor but he wasn't too good as Batman and Val Kilmer was almost as good Michael.  If they ever did make a 5th Batman movie, they should use Michael Keaton, even thou he is getting quite old.  But who the hell cares.  These are great films that you could watch with your kids, just don't let kids under 5 watch the second one.  It is a bit too dark for younger viewers.  But I'm sure you can let your kids under 5 watch the other ones.<br />Batman-This is the best one of the series of coarse and has the best bad guy, The Joker played by, who else but Jack Nicholson.  He's the only one who could have done the Joker.  This film isn't as dark as the others and is a great action film.<br />10/10<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence, mild graphic violence, stylized action and some language.<br />Batman Returns-This is a great film and was one dark dark movie.  Danny DeVito was great as the Penguin and made it an enjoyable bad guy, not like alot of bad guys out there today.<BR>Michael Keaton is Batman for the last time in this one.<BR>8/10<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence, dark humor, language, and stylized action.<br />Batman Forever-Val Kilmer should have been Batman is Batman and Robin.  He is almost as good as Keaton is.  This time the bad guys are The Riddler played by the one and only Jim Carrey, and Two Face as the great Tommy Lee Jones.  The thrid time around is great for most third sequels never really work out.<BR>9/10<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence, dark humor, and stylized action.<br />Batman and Robin-This is an ok entry in the Batman series but could have been much better.  I think Joel rushed through it to get it out as quick as possible.  George Clooney puts up an ok jobas Batman and Arnold is awsome as Mr. Freeze.  And that's my opinian.<BR>7/10<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence and stylized action.<br />So all in all I would have to give this set a 9/10 and is well worth your money.
B00004S6GL|5.0|An impressive suite of perfect gestures, 15 remarkably meticulous and dazzling aerian ballets of 3 minutes each. 15 songs straight from heaven. Elliott Smith was simply the best songwriter of his generation in the US.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This album transcends all the labels.  Johnny Cash was a great American original and this album is one of his best.  You certainly don't have to be a fan of country music to appriciate the music on this disc.  It's just great music.  It begins with a classic, ends with a song written by an inmate and never falters in between.<br />If you're not a fan of country music (I'm certainly not!) but you've heard about this record, believe me, you won't be disappointed in the least.  It's fantastic.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Wow. I bought this album the day it was released the minute the store opened. I was waiting for this album for so long. Cannibal Corpse are phenomenal. They are buy far the best in the business and keep on getting better. While I don't think they will ever have songs as good as &quot;Sentenced to Burn&quot; or &quot;Stripped, Raped, and Strangled&quot;, their albums overall continue to get better. Plus, the bonus DVD on this album is excellent. I unfortunately live where Cannibal Corpse will never come play, so any chance to see them play/jam/rehearse via DVD is great. Plus, seeing them chillin' and stuff is great. Every death metal fan should have this.
B000001FS3|5.0|How can you ever match the poetry of 'The Joshua Tree'? I think this album surpasses others on the sheer genius and emotion of its compositions. Listening to this album is soulful, though-provoking, and utterly enjoyable, even if it be the hundreth or thousandth time it has graced your ears.<br />In terms of poetry, &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot; contains some of my favorite.  It's inspired.<br />If you, like a friend of mine (who's even living in IRELAND!), think you are a U2 fan but do not have this album, GET IT TODAY!
B00018D3RI|5.0|It was fun watching the episodes of Starsky and Hutch.  The chemistry between Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul is wonderful.  I did not see all of the original episodes in the past so it was fun to see episodes that I recognized and those that were &quot;new&quot; to me.  I hope that they will release the other seasons on DVD in the near future.
5550155184|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is an enjoyable read, complex and creative, for a page-turner.<br /><br />The characters do not lead normal lives (eat, sleep, experience emotional conflict etc.) The author has a police cryptographer and a symbolist pursuing a murder, chasing grail clues and being chased, by an albino, by the police and, in turn, by the murderer. They take planes, trains, armoured trucks and various automobiles, which are magically at their disposal whenever they hit a dead end.<br /><br />At any rate, the book is flawed and full of misinformation about Leonardo Da Vinci, Mary Magdalene, the Catholic Church and related splinter groups. I don't know how anyone could be seriously offended by such a superficial treatment of art interpretation and religious history.<br /><br />That aside, it was fun to try to solve the codes and clues left along the way and see which path the author chose to take for the next episode.
B00005QDW1|5.0|never has anyone seen such a band quite as unique as no doubt, ever since their debut for &quot;trapped in a box&quot;...and their music gets better and better! rock steady is a kick ass album with many good tunes like &quot;hey baby&quot;, &quot;underneath it all&quot;, &quot;waiting room&quot; and &quot;hella good&quot;. its not just all ska or rock, there is a bit of a mix of everything which makes this album unique and worth listening to. this is the type of album that i'll listen to when i'm feeling down cuz the beat will put you in a good mood! i also find it perfect to play at a party. i'm really looking forward to more great no doubt albums to come!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye has made one of the best albums ever.  It is honestly one of those rare CDs where every song is good.  Just hit play and kick back because every song on here is amazing.  If you buy this are disappointed you need help!
B000089RVX|4.0|honestly, where i live, evanescence is pretty big, and when everyone was crazy over them when &quot;bring me to life&quot; hit the radio stations, i thought it was just another overrated band. But once i heard &quot;going under&quot; and &quot;my immortal&quot;, i just knew i had to check this cd out...and now i'm a fan! the songs are dark, brooding, and even a bit morbid, but amy lee has such a beautiful voice and most of the songs really rock! my personal faves are &quot;going under&quot;, and the soft &quot;hello&quot;, a beautiful, song accompanied with just piano playing and amy lee's voice. if you're a fan of pretty much any type of rock, and love rock bands with female lead singers, pick this up...i don't think you'll regret it!
B00008H2LE|3.0|3.5 stars. Meteora has some great tracks, but as said before, it's a carbon copy of Hybrid Theory. If you didn't know which was which you couldn't tell what tracks were from which album. Every track has an equal opposite omitting the 13 second intro 'Foreward'. And once again, weak lyrics. Hey Chester, pick up a dictionary or thesarus for christ's sake. The only one who has gained any talent between Theory and Meteora is Joseph Hahn. If you're looking for something relatively fresh, I reccomend Reanimation.
B00004SAAX|5.0|This is an important album. Of course everyone knows Toccata and Fugue for organ in D minor, but Bach wrote so much more organ music! Most do not come up to the pinnacles of the Toccata and Fugue, but there are many gems in their own rights. Walcha interprets them beautifully, and a kind of magic speads in the room when I listen. The album is not expensive for what you get. It also seems to be the most respected collection of Bach complete organ works.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This movie is very good, if i had it right now i would watch it over and over and over again. It is a very good movie for litlle ones and even older people. It is an execellent movie and i think everybody should see it!!!!
0142000663|5.0|This is the fifth Steinbeck novel I've read, and I'm deeply impressed by him.  The fact that there are currently some 445 other Amazon reviews out there (almost all ravingly positive) attests to the universal power of this novel.  So, I'll just submit my humble little offering to this Grapes of Wrath shrine with 5 stars, and a caveat:<br />The Grapes of Wrath is long-winded, and slightly &quot;boring&quot;.  However, that said, don't be put off, it's actually hard to put down and reads relatively quickly.  The style of writing matches the content perfectly, and if you read it at long stretches you'll find yourself rhythmically attached to the story.  The long, drawn out narrative is meant to coincide very neatly with the long, depressing hardships the Joads face on their journey to California.  What happens to them along the way, and how Steinbeck chronicles different aspects of 1930's America in alternating chapters is what makes Steinbeck an artist here.  I don't think Steinbeck had quite reached the artistic capacity to create as vividly unique characters as he later does in Cannery Row &amp; Sweet Thursday, but again, The Grapes of Wrath is larger than specific characters, and Tom Joad isn't simply some displaced Oakie, but rather, he is a &quot;spirit&quot; that thankfully, refuses to die.  This novel is as much history as it is a good story.<br />At times you will feel indignant over how our country treated these people, and over the thoughtlessness of it's economic policies during the depression era.  And you will probably find just as ugly parallels today in the arenas of civil rights, education, social welfare, tax reform, and so on.  Thus, Steinbeck has created for posterity an American &quot;ghost&quot; which continues to haunt us.  An American classic, on the &quot;dark side&quot;.<br />If you're so inclined, Steinbeck kept a journal during the writing of this novel, titled, &quot;Working Days&quot; which I highly recommend for further insight into this masterpiece.masterpiece.

However, wheter it was or wasn't accurate to their artistic liking, I must give credit to Mr. Brown for his fantastic imagination and the journey he took us on. As for the Opus Dei, they do exist.
B000089RVX|4.0|THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ROCK CDS FROM LAST YEAR. IT'S COOL HOW AMY LEE'S AMAZING VOCALS ARE APPLIED TO COOL SONGS LIKE ''BRING ME TO LIFE'', ''GOING UNDER'', ''EVERYBODY'S FOOL'', ''TOURNIQUET'', AND ''MY LAST BREATH''. SURE, EVANESCENCE IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BEST ROCK GROUPS TO HAVE HIT THE SCENE RECENTLY. THIS BAND RECENTLY WON A GRAMMY FOR BEST NEW ARTIST. AND THE ALBUM ALSO WON A GRAMMY FOR BEST HARD ROCK PERFORMANCE [''BRING ME TO LIFE''] AND WAS NOMINATED FOR SEVERAL OTHER GRAMMYS, INCLUDING ALBUM OF THE YEAR.

1400034779|5.0|Having spent considerable time in Botswana (most of it living with host families), I find this series to be very endearing and an accurate (if slightly sterotypical) potrayal of life in Botswana.<br />I just want to defend it a bit against accusations of \\"sexism\\" on the part of the protagionist.  You really really have to realize that much of Africa, especially the southern bits, is very \\"macho\\" and man-centered and rather misogynistic.  The protagionist is not saying bad things about ALL men (especially not American men) but of Batswana men, many of whom really can be \\"that bad\\".<br />Sure, it could offend Western sensibilities but you must read in the spirit of cultural relativism and realize that other cultures aren't quite as liberal on the gender-role thing as we are here.<br />Anyway, these books are truely wonderful and capture the spirit and heart of this great country perfectly.
0375713751|3.0|My mother bought this book for me and although I don't have any children, I thought that it might be worth a read since it was hyped as such a best-seller.  In the end, I thought it wasn't bad - certainly there was really never a dull moment - but the characters aren't believable enough, and it's actually really stressful to read!!  You find yourself being strung out on the daily panic of the main character as she struggles to be all things to all people, letting her family fall apart while ignoring the obvious choice which only she can make - to chill out!!<br />Entertaining enough, but definitely not a way to unwind at the end of the day!
0804106304|4.0|The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan, is a mesmerizing novel that leads the reader on a journey to remember. The novel interweaves the stories of four mothers and their daughters. Each chapter brings a new life to learn about, touching the heart in a different way every time. The author wants to leave the reader with a new outlook on the hardship one had to take to come to America. The relationship between mothers and daughters is also a strong theme in the novel. Although the changing of narrators may become a bit confusing, the novel still captures the reader with its entertaining characters and stories that lift the soul.<BR> <BR> The novel is set in America in the present, but many of the stories are told about years past. Several of the stories talk about a time during the war between China and Japan and the people that fled their homes and country. Once in America they began new and better lives with their families. The daughters that grew up in America do not appreciate what their parents, especially their mothers, did for them. This generation gap between them causes frustration and anger for both the mothers and daughters throughout the novel.<br /> The story begins with the character Jing-Mei Woo, whose mother recently passed away. She now has been asked to take her mother's place in the Joy Luck Club, a group of four women who bonded after leaving China, each for their own reason. Jing-Mei Woo describes the group, \\"They are young girls again, dreaming of good times in the past and good times yet to come\\" (41). Each new story is told by either a mother or a daughter about something important that has either already happened or is happening in their life. One of the mothers, Lindo Jong, tells the story of how she escaped her planned marriage and fled China to come to America. She explains how she felt after becoming free, \\"How nice it is to be that girl again, to take off my scarf, to see what is underneath\\"(66). One of the daughters, Lena St. Clair, tells the story of how her brother drowned when she was young. The stories continue, each more excellent than the last, until the end. The last story is told, once again, by Jing-Mei Woo about how she granted a special wish to her deceased mother.<br /> The Joy Luck Club was a pure joy to read because of its entertaining characters, heart touching stories, and the special theme of mother-daughter relationships. Each chapter introduced a new life to learn about, which kept the novel enjoyable to read at all times. This changing of narrators did become a bit confusing; having to look back and remember which character is which. Other than that, each new person brought their own personality and story to tell, making the reader feel as if he/she were meeting a whole new group of friends. By the end of the book, the reader knows each character intimately. The book achieves its goal of having the reader learn about the heroic ordeal of immigration, through the detailed stories the women tell about leaving China to make better lives for their families. Several of the stories open the reader's mind to the heartache and turmoil the women had to go through to come to America. The work the mothers did so their daughters would have lives is not appreciated however. A large generation gap between the mothers from China and their American daughters is very evident in the novel. Since the reader hears from both the mothers and their daughters, he/she can see both of their views and opinions. The gap between generations is very easy to relate to, since many parents and their offspring see the world very differently, even today. The Chinese customs that are introduced in the book help give it culture. The game of mah jong is talked about, along with many other Chinese eating habits and celebrations. These simple touches give the reader a sense of China's interesting way of life and highlights how the daughters may see the world a little differently than their mothers.<br /> The intertwined tales of four mothers and their daughters brings the reader on a journey from years ago in China to America in the present.  Through all of the characters' individual stories about life, relationships, and Chinese culture, a single beautiful novel emerges that opens the mind and captures the heart.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|If britney was not yet a woman on her last album, she has certainly advanced and become one on her latest album. I cannot find one song similar to any featued on her first 2 albums, and i am very grateful for this. Her music styles seem to advance at the same time as mine, and this album contains a mixture of hip-hop, trace and dance songs, with some amazing ballads. The highlights of this album are toxic, her next single \\"everytime\\", showdown and the very sexy breathe on me.<BR>this version of the album features to bonus tracks, \\"the answer\\" was produced by P.Diddy and is not one of my favourite songs, but \\"don't hang up\\" is great. similar to some of the songs on \\"brintey\\"<BR>i highly recommend this cd.
B00000J6AG|4.0|Just ask anyone across the pond.  In 1999-2002, DJ's from all over were still making remixes from cuts on this album.  I wasn't the biggest Moby fan but admit that this certainly pushed him up a peg in my book.  No need for an introduction of him or his label - most know who he is!<br />Simply put, this is an essential cd for anyone that's into collecting work from DJ's or interested in the originals behind the many great remixes that spawned from this album.  From trance facelifts to &quot;Natural Blues&quot; on the Euphoria series to the chillout ambience of &quot;My Weakness&quot;... also on the Euphoria chill series, it's just a sound album.  Probably the most mainstream of the cuts here is &quot;South Side&quot;, a good tune that crept into main-stream with Gwen Stefani.  And if you remember when the Lincoln LS debuted a few years ago (well, maybe it was several!), there was a big deal about &quot;Porcelain&quot; being used in the innovative commercial and advertising.  Another notable track that made loads and loads of playlists was &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad&quot;.<br />The verdict?  I would certainly recommend it.  But if you're a fan of what you've heard on the radio - i.e., the Gwen Stefani track then you would understandably be disappointed with this.  Also, not all of the tracks here grabbed me.  I think 2002 was the year that &quot;18&quot; came out - I don't think it's as strong as this one but it is certainly similar.  And since then he has released an album titled &quot;Baby Monkey&quot; under the monker &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;.  It's an electronic sound and much different than this.  But if you're a die-hard Moby fan, you'll want it and 18.  And certainly check out his live shows if you can!
B000002LK1|5.0|This may be the greatest album ever created. Every song feels like the ol' boys spent some time on it. &quot;World in my Eyes&quot; pretty much sums up how this album is gonna be, one HELL of a trip! I love how all these people listen to &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and declare DM Christian lovers. You don't get more anti-religion than PJ. Of course this album wouldn't be the masterpiece that it is without the number 1 single of the decade, &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;. I still believe that if they made &quot;Blue Dress&quot; a single, it would be just as big as EtS. &quot;Clean&quot; ends Violator with an omen which would haunt DM a few years later. <BR>Violator blows other great albums such as The White Album, Dark Side of the Moon, Joshua Tree or anything else you can think of out of the water.

B00009Z574|5.0|Another fantastic Yes album remastered!  Really, outside of the stupid album title I don't really find any complaints with Tormato.  I guess since I was a youngin when I got into these guys in 95 or so (16yrs old) I didn't know the stigma hanging over this album.  Thankfully, without the bias, I grew to love this album as much as anything they'd ever done.  Solid song writing with some true Yes classics.  Rick's keyboard work is awesome and some of the jagged edges of the previous few albums have been rounded off.  Regardless, this album deserves the median rating of 3 at worst.  No Yes fan could ever rightly call this album a piece of crap.  As for me, I can't really point to a song that doesn't kick ass.  Great stuff!  Also, with this being the last disc with Jon and Rick for a bit, the bonus tracks are great.  Same thing with Drama as that has the Paris sessions before Jon and Rick took off.  Awesome to hear the multitude of extras.
B00012QM8G|1.0|An excellent and long-waited movie finally released on DVD by Universal Pictures.<br />Movie itself - 5 stars,<BR>disc and case - 1 star: flipper disc (probably has the historical value), crappy paper case (obviously made using the gluestick and scissors), missing title list or booklet, poor list of extras.<br />I bought my DVD disc from Amazon.com hence there`s no need to think that I received some kind of the Estonian DVD version. <br />Yeah, nice work Universal, putting the movie on the flipper disc. It`s really pleasant that we don`t have to buy the movie in the two separate cases released in different months. Or even years.<br />P.S. Maybe the look of the package is intentional? I mean - to make it look like it´s handmade by the survivors of the concentration camps? If so, please keep the buyers informed, just to make sure that they`ve not been cheated.
0689859368|4.0|This is very good book written by two little known people. Tony Diterlizi and Holly Black worked together to create these fantasy stories about faries that seem real. This is the start to a fantastic series. The books are short but good enough to read over and over again. The authors wrote about three average children who move with their mother into their crazy aunts house. This is where the story begins.<br />   Not long after the three grace children move into their aunt's house, Jared, Mallory, and Simon find a nest in the walls and many other weird things. Jared finds a book written by his missing great uncle Authur Spiderwick. With the Field Guide the siblings find the house brownie and  realize their life is like a book, and they're only at the begining.
B00005JKJA|4.0|My son contacted me after watching \\"Mulholland Drive\\" and demanded that I explain the last ten minutes of this film.  I tried to provide the simple explanation--to wit, this 2001 film is written and directed by David Lynch--but that was not enough of an explanation.  Part of the problem, if you consider it to be such, is that \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is more style than substance, with Lynch creating his more surrealistic film yet.  There might be those who think that this is some sort of film noir because there is a scene where a couple of hard-boiled cops show up and spout film noir type dialogue.  But there are bits and pieces of different film genres throughout the film, which is another clue to the tapestry of Lynch's tale.<br /><br />I lucked out when I started watching \\"Mulholland Drive\\" because the beginning, in which Rita (Laura Elena Harring) barely survives being murdered because of a car accident, strongly reminded me of the beginning of the cult classic horror film \\"Carnival of Souls\\" (the original and not the ghastly remake).  The connection was a shot in the dark, but it had me thinking that everything was not what it seems right from the start in this film.  However, when the second main character in the drama, Betty (Naomi Watts), gets off the plane in Hollywood ready to pursue her quest to become a star, it never dawned on me that there was more to the kindly old couple that wishes her well and drive off in a limosine.  Betty moves into an apartment, only to discover Rita, who has apparently suffered amnesia after her near death experiences, taking a shower.  Betty is from Canada, so she opts for helping Rita rather than calling the police.  The two become friends and more than friends in a couple of the best sex scenes seen in a movie in the last decade (they also serve to underscore how unsexy most sex scenes are in movies today).<br /><br />There are other characters and plots in this film where the bits and pieces do not always fit nicely together.  The film that many viewers will think of when they watch \\"Mulholland Drive\\" would be \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" first because there is a scene where two characters have a strange and intense conversation in a family restaurant but also because there are all these plots lines and intersects in various ways.  For example, there is a movie director (Justin Therous) who is told he will be killed if does not cast a particular actress in his movie and a dwarf in a wheelchair (Michael J. Anderson from Lynch's \\"Twin Peaks) who issues orders on his cell phone.  But the key narrative thread is Betty trying to become a star and find love in Hollywood.  However, it soon becomes clear that we are seeing that played out in multiple ways.<br /><br />\\"Mulholland Drive\\" is a movie about Hollywood, or more appropriately the dream of Hollywood.  It means something that Rita, who does remember her real name, pulls the one she uses from a movie poster for \\"Gilda.\\"  Betty is the plucky young kids from the sticks who wants to be a star.  The unwritten rule about such people is that they would do anything to achieve their dream and in a sense Lynch's film just flips the dream over and looks at the nightmare side of the equation.  However, I have no problem with the idea that for many of those who watch this film that \\"Muholland Drive\\" will not come close to making sense to them until the second time they see it and that many of those people are not going to make the effort.  For those of us who have seen Lynch's other films, most notably \\"Eraserhead\\" and \\"Blue Velvet,\\" we knew going in that was probably going to be necessary.  I mean, come on.  This is David Lynch people.

B00006IK1C|5.0|Bruce Dickinson, lead singer of Iron Maiden, has had several solo releases, but I liked this one - his first - the best. When I bought this release back in 1990 I wore out the cassette. I was a huge Iron Maiden fan at the time and automatically bought &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot; when it was released.<br />I was surpised how different it was from Iron Maiden, but it was a solid album and one I still enjoy listening to today, 14 years later. &quot;Tattooed Millionaire,&quot; &quot;Born in '58&quot; and the remake of &quot;All The Young Dudes&quot; were my favorites, but most of the songs are solid. It was straight foward album rock at its best.<br />I admit listening to this album brings back good memories for me. I was 19 at the time and it's amazing how much my life has changed since 1990. Ah, the good old days....<br />Several of Dickinson's other solo releases such received more positive reviews from magazines such as &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot; but I will always believe &quot;Tattooed Millionare&quot; tops them all.<br />A great CD to have in your metal collection.
B00003CX8V|4.0|This is Jack Lemmon at his best. I think this movie was funny, witty and had everything most storylines in today's films lack......depth.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's album is being overlooked by many mainly because for one reason: it is BY Britney Spears. Half these &quot;one star&quot; reviews have even heard the content of this album besides the overplayed 2 singles &quot;Toxic&quot; and &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;.<br />Britney's voice isn't great, I think everybody got this the first time we heard her back in the Baby One More Time Days. Don't judge the ALBUM based on her voice. Britney is NOT getting her career boosted because of her &quot;amazing voice&quot; - we all know it. It's old. She is clearly an entertainer with amazing beats, good dance moves, and an artistic piece of mind. Not everybody can make an album like this. Try it and rejudge your bad reviews. It would be better if you even picked up the album before jumping to conclusions.
B00009V7RF|4.0|This is a really great album! I put it on when I'm going to the club or out with my friends. It really gets you moving and ready to party! A couple songs I could have done without...such as the Apl. Song and Latin Girls, which lacked any real depth, but overall a good dance album.
B00000JRTX|1.0|Deliriously unfunny flick about Dysfunctional British White Trash Set starring that English guy with sticky big tooth grin who can't stop \\"acting\\" as if were 14 years old (O.K. 8 years old). McDowell's set in granite smile even more putrid as was her ameba like portrayal of worthless All American tramp. <BR>It goes without saying that only the two homosexuals would be portrayed as being half way decent and not altogether mindless. <br />Film pinned a phony Valentine on characters at the tail end, can't say why other than to relieve viewers suffering. Actually, couldn't take more than 40 minutes of it. Didn't matter because if you only see the first 20 min. that will be sufficient (they didn't title this one Four Wedding for nothing). Reappeared during the last five to see dumb resolution. Didn't buy a word of it. Doesn't matter because NOTHING about these characters mattered. Sickening making. Typical European yuck and snot. <BR>No surprise that it went over big in America.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Underworld is a fantastic movie and I absolutely love the DVD.<br />Kate Beckinsale's character Selen is the new Ripley, she is taking over where Sigorney Weaver left off in the Alien series with a tough, beautiful, strong character. The incredible storyline of intertwining Vampires and Werewolfs is incredibly well done. This movie was beautifully shot in a dark tone with a gothic city as its backdrop. I have watched it about 4 times now and everytime I pick up something new.<br />The special features on the dvd bring a lot of interesting things to mind as well. I totally agree with director Len Wiseman, CGI has become too un-realistic, and way over used in movies. Using real people as the creatures make them that much scarier. Rent it, buy it....whatever, you won't be dissapointed.<br />I just read that Kate has signed on for the sequel, and that the script is almost finished!!

B0000714B5|1.0|As a Buddhist and a fan of the book this film not only offended me as a follower of the Buddha but as a fan of Mr. Hesse's novel.  This film has nothing in common with the reality of either.  The sound is not very good either.  If this film were made of the story of Christ with the same liberty, the filmmaker would have been dragged through the streets.  Fortunately, Buddhists just sigh and turn away.

B00000IPAX|4.0|Ok, I'm not much of a fan of punk, but this album was pretty damn good. The guitar parts, though simple, do show depth of melody, and the vocals, band does wonders with harmony. People say Travis is only good because he's fast, but that's only partially true, and even so, he's still easily on of the best punk drummers out there. As a fan of more talented bands like Tool, I can accuse this band of shallow song structure and lyrics, but sometimes that's life. What I wanna know is, why do people have so much beef with the band just because of these petty little details? Melody is the most important thing, and if you've got that down, your already a good band. Again, I've got &quot;sophisticated&quot; tastes, so don't accuse me not knowing a thing about music. Give this CD a listen, it'll be worth it.

I don't mind stereotypes and ham acting (see, I keep thinking about his books as movies) but I want some thrill and suspense to compensate. I have no use for flat characters in an amateur kid psychology novel. Halfway through the book I decided to quickly read ahead and see how it finished and I'm glad I didn't waste more time on it.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|It's interesting to see one of the negative reviews that says go look at people in a bar because if you enjoy looking at people in bars you might enjoy this movie. He's right. This movie IS for people who like looking at the human beings around them. <br />It's for people who like human beings in general. And not for people who are uninterested in people but need something to explode to grab their attention.<br />Personally I enjoy movies about real people. I enjoy movies where I can see individuals who I might actually meet and care about. I thought this one was very good.<br />Perhaps much of the bad comment comes because some have been suckered into seeing a movie that's just not their cup of Java. More fool them. There are a lot of gentle, subtle, sensitive films like this that are loved by people who do not love standard lowbrow movies. Most of them come from Europe or Japan. Their usual audiences would not write such stupid comments. (Notice the general level of writing in most of the one star reviews?) <br />One thing I am happy about with the success of this film is it sends a message to Hollywood producers who like to feed us cr*p like &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; - maybe one of the worst movies ever made.<br />And that message is: &quot;Hollywood we are not ALL stupid.&quot; There are not enough movies like this. Give us more.
0385504209|5.0|Hey folks...It's a NOVEL, meaning it's FICTION! Lighten up! I loved the book. Very well researched, then artistic license taken AS IT SHOULD BE. IT'S FICTION! Besides, religion is for those who can't cope with death and refuse to accept the fact that when you die, worms eat you and nothing more. Does God really need money, or a church? Mankind wrote the Bible, not God. Get a life people, and read this book. It really is excellent.

0060392886|4.0|I'm about halfway through as I write this...previous reviews are correct in that you simply can't put this book down, mainly because every time you think the band has sunk to the deepest depths of depravity, they surprise you by going further. This is a story of how four people who lived like utter pigs and treated themselves and those around them with utter disdain made millions of dollars with very little talent.<br />The book makes me angry because I hate to see people with no values and minimal talent retire before age 30 with more money than they'll hope to spend in a lifetime. Still, the book is a bona fide page-turner, and I'll likely read it again and again with the fascination of watching a car crash.

B000001ESP|5.0|This rightfully deserves its reputation as a top Rush album, if not the best effort in a sizeable catalogue.<br />Moving Pictures falls square in between the hard, progressive rock of their 70s concept albums and their later alternative sound with its embrace of synthesizers.  There are synths, but they're worked in to accent the music here.  With Signals, the 1982 followup, Rush would take on a more layered, synth-heavy sound where Alex Lifeson's guitar would serve more as color work, or even disappear into the mix later in the decade.<br />This album is concise, and the vinyl was programmed perfectly.  With only seven tracks, there is no weakness here, and the first side features one famed piece after another.  Side one opens with perhaps the band's most famous single, Tom Sawyer.  The synth sound accents the hard riffs in this cynical ode to rebellion and individualism.  Red Barchetta is a total fan favorite and live staple about a young man's weekly tradition of racing his uncle's old hot rod.  YYZ is a funky instrumental that is also a live staple and instantly recognizable with its ride cymbal opening.  Then Limelight brings it home with its deep, fat riffs in a song about the concept of fame (hence the title.)<br />The old second side is more cerebral, I think.  Camera Eye is an 10+ minute epic, the last of its kind for the band.  The music is phenomenol--this doesn't feel as long as it really is.  Part of that is due to the structure of the song--it's split into two considerations of 'the city'.  First it's New York, then London, talking about the hustle and bustle and the lives people have in these crowded spaces.  The track is contemplative rock, highlighted by warm synths and excellent riffing.  Then comes Witch Hunt, a superb track.  It opens dark and menacing, the sounds of a colonial witch hunt (locals ranting and raving with imagery of pitchforks and torches) over an eerie synth.  The song is monstrous--it opens up with Geddy's wailing and more synths, and Neil Peart's ridiculous fills.  The whole album comes to a close with the tense but controlled Vital Signs, featuring more effective synth work, more contemplative lyrics.<br />Rush has always been a thinking man's rock group, going beyond the call of duty of rock to provide something of substance in a mass market field.  They don't churn out tired love songs or whining odes to the misery of life.  And how many groups can get away with lines like `faces are twisted and grotesque'?  Rush never makes the top of the charts, they don't make many videos, they don't live like decadent rock stars (though the guitarist had a particularly rock-star New Year's Eve incident turn ugly), they don't create controversy to mask a lack of talent, they don't resort to tricks or gimmicks.<br />The Rush remasters are very welcome, though the more valuable releases are the earlier ones that were recorded in analog.  (Rush actually started going to digital recording pretty early.)  It's interesting to listen to the new and then the old, and compare how the mix has changed.  The traditionally crisp sound of the band is enhanced with the remasters and is clearer than ever.  You can usually find them a bit cheaper than most new retail discs, though you may want to pick and choose your favorite Rush albums to upgrade.ths, and Neil Peart's ridiculous fills.

B00012QM8G|1.0|Stephen Spielberg's sugar-coated holocaust story, carefully calculated to be an Oscar© contender in the same year as his big popcorn hit &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; arrives in a cheap non-sealing cardboard flip-case and a two-sided disc with no significant extras.
0345452577|4.0|In my opinion, Johnathan Kellerman's previous character, Alex Deleware, had gotten a little stale.  This book is a refreshing introduction of a new character.  The action is lively, the plot moves along, and the plot's concept is entertaining.  A worthy read.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|The best thing about the digital version of SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE is the exceptional commentary with Jack Nicholson and filmmaker Nancy Meyers. I know of no other record of Nicholson speaking so openly about his acting choices. There are tantalizing references to deleted scenes not included as extras on this disc.  A fun and funny mature romantic comedy that will satisfy and delight.
0385510438|5.0|A fantastic read!  Grisham deviates from the &quot;greedy lawyer&quot; genre he helped to popularize (tho the book contains several characters who are attorneys), and he does what he does best- storytelling of the people in the deep South.  Woven into the main plot- a murder and trial- is a fully fleshed corps of characters, some likeable and others not, and as the book proceeds, I found myself truly interested in most of them and the outcome of the plot.  This is by far his best written novel.
B00001OH7G|5.0|Back in the 70's I saw Rory play at the legendary 'My Father's Place' in Roslyn Long Island where he played every song on the CD so it brings back indelible memories. Rory and the band played with such power and energy I recall thinking they were undermining the structural integrity of the building. The technical excellence of Rory's blues guitar and vocals were transcended by the personal connection he made with the audience.<BR>He was more than a performer: he tore off a piece of his soul giving everyone a share. Unreal. But let the music speak for the Man. That night the audience were euphoric. Though I have seen many great performers over the years nothing tops that night.<BR>This CD brings it all back. In two hundred years people will still be enjoying this classic. &quot;Nice one, Rory. Nice one, Son. Nice one Rory, let's have another one.&quot;
B0000025DV|5.0|You know those desert island discs people talk about? Those top 10 lists? This CD is one of those for me.<br />In 1977, I was a teenager, just graduated from high school, working the lightweight job. ELO's previous album \\"A New World Record\\" was in the 8-track deck in the Pinto a lot. I adored everything about that project and like a lot of ELO fans anxiously awaited the next release. When I heard it was going to be a double album I was prepared for the worst. After all, how many double album packages were great? OK, the Beatles white album was pretty good but I was afraid Jeff Lynne would produce a mess like the John Lennon \\"Number 9\\" thing at the end of the white album. (OK, you can direct the hate mail to me.)<br />But I was not prepared when I went to the record store in 1977 and plopped down almost four hours wages at the time to buy the 8 track on the day of release. I didn't open it up then, I went immediately home and relaxed a bit, put on the headphones and listened. Holy moley! I listened again. And again. I remember I listened to it 6 times that night. I couldn't get over the fact that there was nothing wrong with this album. Starting off with the single \\"Turn To Stone\\" and ending with the fantasy \\"Wild West Hero\\" I couldn't find fault. I instantly thought \\"Sweet Talkin' Woman\\" was one of the finest singles ever. \\"Jungle\\" a song about ALL the world and its inhabitants having one big party, the four song \\"concerto\\", \\"The Whale\\" one of the finest songs with whales singing the lead. <br />Each song evokes a different emotion and strong memories for me. This IS Jeff Lynne's masterpiece. I'd recommend buying a greatest hits package if you want ELO's biggies, but if you want to dig a bit deeper and get a sense of what a great composer and producer Jeff Lynne is (hey, he wasn't a \\"Traveling Wilbury\\" for nothing), then this 4 sided record on 1 CD is the to buy. Since that initial 8 track, I bought it on LP and now on CD, where it sounds as bright and crisp as theLP and of course 100 times better than the ol' 8 track. Where is that thing anyway?
B00005OAIE|5.0|I don't see how people cannot like John Mayer, if they are into the kind of music he does. He has a wonderful voice, and excellent lyrics. I write songs myself and only wish I could write songs that have the same feel as his. This CD is excellent and I am sorry for myself, that I didn't become a fan of John Mayer a long time ago when he first started. He is almost the most underrated singer I know. Well this CD is awesome, every song on it is the best, it hasn't left my CD player since I got it, and neither has Heavier Things. I definately recommend buying this CD, if you are a fan of this type of music and know good talent, you won't regret it.
B0000AUHPG|3.0|what great potential the DVD format has, a full and complete film could well have fitted nicely on a DVD, great music and all. The cuts made to the DVD are obvious, to suddenly jump from the train scene to a cave in some rocks is without meaning, a clean shaven Bronson suddenly gets a scar, why. A non-Directors cut version would be marvelous as I suspect that whoever had the scizzors in this version was not sober. The music of Morricone is wonderful.  Frank Just.NZ.

B00003CXSM|1.0|I love romantic comedies so I sat down to watch this one waiting to fall in love.  Was I in for a disappointment!  <br />Jennifer Lopez is a terrible actress and there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Matthew McConaughey (who is adorable in How to Lose a Guy).  Further more the movie celebrates a guy who is about to be married flirting and drooling and making goo-goo eyes at a perfect stranger.  And the ending!  I won't give it away, let's just say that there are NO surprises here, you can see this one coming from a mile away!<br />If you want to sit down with a blanket, some comfort food, and a great chick flick check out Bridget Jones, Return to Me, When Harry Met Sally or French Kiss.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Wonderful. It's so good to finally see Bill Murray in something good again. Many people dubbed this 'A great film about nothing' and I would say they hit the nail on the head.<BR>Most films, great as they are, never seem to escape the realm of 'Film' while I'm watching them. All the time I'm depicting  the details, questioning the script, reflecting on the camerawork etc.<BR>This film is different though. You will quite literally just sink in to it and forget about script and everything else for the few hours in which it lasts. <BR>Overall it's just a truly lovely film and anyone who likes anything should like it!
0385504209|5.0|I picked up this book with a little bit of skepticism because of all the hoopla surrounding the book. Two days later I was glad I read it. It is a well written and researched book. It grabs the readers from the very beginning takes them on a wonderful journey. A well designed balance of historical facts propels the book and never lets up. The ending is well thought out and worth the effort to get there. I really enjoyed this book and now understand why others do too.
6305308659|5.0|This is a question that ran through my mind while watching Pleasantville starring Reese Witherspoon as Jennifer/Mary Sue Parker, and Tobey Maguire as David/Bud Parker.<br />Pleasantville follows two teenage siblings as they are transported to a world that is \\"pleasant\\" every moment of every day.  Being thrust into another reality wherein which the norm is \\"perfection,\\" Jennifer and David must pose as Bud and Mary Sue, children in a black and white television series set in a small town, until David can contact the television repair man, played by Don Knotts, who is responsible for their nether world experience.<br />As they realize they are captive until contact can be reestablished, they begin interacting with members of the town in an effort to not throw off their \\"entire existence,\\" in effect acting out the episodes David has memorized.  However, given that Jennifer is not pleased by having to be held hostage by such a boring place, she chooses to engage in a little paradigm shifting/deviant behavior.<br />Interactions by David and Jennifer with the citizens cause them to begin seeing the world in very different terms; namely that of color. The result being a blossoming red rose, the first color in Pleasantville, symbolizing the awakening/unfolding consciousness of the community; and a pink bubblegum bubble, which symbolizes an expanding of consciousness.  As this awakening occurs, the yearning for knowledge produces an infectious need to consume mass amounts of information among the newly colored.  For instance, in one scene, upon discovering the joy of reading, the children and young-adults begin visiting the local library to absorb information on a consistent basis.<br />As the town's \\"colored\\" residents move beyond the bonds of social control, their appetite for information re: what else is \\"out there\\" becomes the most important endeavor.  When this newfound information and freedom are incorporated into their daily lives, there begins the need to find balance in this \\"brave new world.\\"  Yet, before this level can be attained in Pleasantville, the residents must undergo many tense moments in an effort to understand what is happening in their little town.<br />In a meeting being held in the Town Hall, the Mayor says, \\"we have to separate out the things that are pleasant from the things that are unpleasant.\\" With that, he and his staff institute a Code of conduct.  According to these \\"codes\\" which simultaneously focus on social control and \\"reintegrative shaming,\\" a concept by Braithwaite, we see how the town's leaders seek to regain control over and in their Pleasantville.  Of their codes, three stand out for me:<br />1.) The area commonly known as Lovers Lane as well as the Pleasantville Public Library shall be closed until further notice.<br />2.) The only permissible paint colors shall be black, white, or gray, despite the recent availability of certain alternatives.<br />3.) All elementary and high school curriculums shall teach the non-changes view of history emphasizing continuity over alteration.<br />The above samples of the \\"Codes of Conduct\\" are an instance of direct social control by the town's leaders.  As one would expect, they also hold the potential of creating a sub-culture, which only serves to compound \\"deviant behavior.\\"<br />In other subtle, but equally poignant, moments/scenes the element of shame/deviance is also revealed.  For instance, when Bud and Mary Sue's mother discovers the joy of phalangeal and labial interaction, she becomes \\"colored,\\" which suggests she has done something impure to become so.  Due to the stigma attached to her \\"deviant behavior\\" which produced the coloring, she sought to hide her shame from not only her husband, but the larger community as well.  It is not until she encounters Bill Johnson, artist and soda fountain owner, played by Jeff Daniels, that she reveals her color without shame.<br />In an effort to illustrate that being different is not inherently a bad thing, Bud/David engages in a little demonstration to prove to the Mayor that all have the potential to be different or \\"deviant\\" and hence also possess the ability to move beyond their accepted reality in constructing a new reality that incorporates and legitimates newfound experiences.  Once made valid in the new social structure, the potential to evolve beyond recent revelations once thought to be a hindrance are not only probable, but are duly beneficial.  His point crystallized, the town emerges into a new world with possibilities unbounded.<br />Concluding Thoughts<br />Everyone is on a journey to find enlightenment and balance in their reality, social control notwithstanding; a reality that encompasses and celebrates diversity as an asset as opposed to being a liability.  Given that the potential to realize immeasurable possibilities lie within the core of our being, it is imperative that we begin embracing new thoughts of not only ourselves, but others as well.  Upon comprehending the methods involved in the creation of a new and different reality, based on an awareness of a collective sub-conscious resting just below the level of conscious activity, a new reality will emerge; one rooted in the incontrovertible fact that the only constant is consistent change.  Given so, I must say Pleasantville is a wonderful movie that provokes thought beyond being mere entertainment, for it reaches into the ever-illusive realm of edutainment, but with lots of laughs.  Great movie!<br />Note: the above is part of a work presented in a course on Deviant Behavior and Social Control.Bud/David engages in a little demonstration to prove to the Mayor that all have the potential to be different or \\"deviant\\" and hence also possess the ability to move beyond their accepted reality in constructing a new reality that incorporates and legitimates newfound experiences.

Susie was lured into an underground den and brutally raped and murdered. <BR>Alice Sebold's novel, The Lovely Bones is a traumatic, humorous, suspenseful, and touching novel. I love the way she expresses all of the emotions through her characters. It allowed me to be more in touch with them as I was watching. Each sentence flowed so beautifully that I wanted to continue to read and not close the book. I loved how Sebold had Susie narrate her story from heaven! It gave it a whole new feel for me. It was very interesting, and it fit in well with the story. <BR>The Lovely Bones is a novel that will make you cry, laugh, be angry, but also make you appreciate what you have and the nature around you; such as sunshine, life, family, and friends. Sebold narrates this concept beautifully throughout the book! It has a great finish and almost everyone gets what they want.
6305313687|5.0|American History X, Starring Edward Norton (as Derek Vinyard) and Edward Furlong (as Daniel \\"Danny\\" Vinyard), is one of the greatest silver screen efforts to bring to the fore a discussion regarding the construct of race and one of its many manifestations: hate both of others and yourself.  The movie delicately balances the topic in terms of thematic coloring, i.e. black and white for reflection and color for the present.  Not only is this technique, effective in reflection, it also serves as a symbol to encompass and discuss the antagonistic positions held between \\"Blacks and Whites\\" in the film as well.  However, more important than style, this movie has the potential to become a classic among all types of viewers, for it is a catalyst for discussions of change for all parties involved.<br />American History X portrays the rise of a white supremacist organization and its impact on one Venice Beach family.  Told from the perspective of Danny, younger brother of Derek, who is a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Cameron Alexander, played by Stacy Keach, founder of the D.O.C., it also delves into the genesis of hate as it relates to the Vineyard family. Given that it is told from a perspective not widely portrayed in American media: from that of a member of a professed \\"hate group,\\" it captures the attention and imagination of the viewer with its charged storyline and reflective camera work.<br />After meeting with Danny's History teacher regarding the inflammatory nature of an assignment, Sweeney, brilliantly played by Avery Brooks, says to Danny, \\"so, here's the drill.  I'm your history teacher from now on.  We will discuss current events.  We will call this class American History X.  We meet once a day.  Your first assignment is to prepare for me a new paper, due tomorrow.  I want you to analyze and interpret all the events surrounding Derek's incarceration.  How these events helped shape your present perspective concerning life in contemporary America.\\"  Danny reluctantly agrees and sets out on a journey that will be both painful and enlightening.<br />There are several poignant moments in the film; the first being when Derek takes one of the car thieves, and in killing him provides a tongue-across-the-teeth moment not soon forgotten.  Also, when Sweeney says, \\"I am not disputing the fact that the child is confused. And he harbors some sick ideas.  But I'm not ready to give up on him yet.\\"  He goes on to say, \\"this racist propaganda, this Mein Kampf psychobabble; he learned this nonsense Murray, and he can unlearn it too.  I will not give up on this child yet.\\"  Such a moment illustrates that as humans and social beings, our behavior is learned and acted out and the level of belief.<br />Shot in past and present-time, American history X provides the viewer with many profound moments for consideration.  In one such instance, upon Derek's incarceration, one of his initial teachable moments comes in the form of fellow inmate Lamont, masterfully played by Guy Torry.  In an attempted dialogue, Lamont, after Derek is reluctant to talk, reminds him that his position, while incarcerated, is not one of privilege.  This appeared to be a sobering moment as to not only the reality of his situation, but of the rhetoric voiced by his mentor Cameron Alexander.<br />As Derek begins to come to the realization of what white supremacy really is, via the action/inaction of his compatriots, his fellow inmates turn on him.  Having been dehumanized, Derek receives a visit from Sweeney.  During this visit, Sweeney asks him perhaps the most important question of his life; \\"has anything you've done made your life better?\\"  With that question raging in his head, Derek begins a journey of self-discovery that eventually leads him away from the ideological rhetoric of his mentor, Cameron Alexander and the D.O.C., to the asking of weightier questions about what he has done not only to himself, but his family.<br />With Sweeney's assistance, Derek begins to understand the construct of race and how he fell into the trap laid by Alexander.  Upon his release, Derek decides to confront Alexander and lay to rest the demons that haunted him during the three years of his incarceration.<br />After the confrontation with Alexander and in a conversation with Danny, Derek begins to explain what he encountered in prison.  He discusses how angry he felt at the world and states \\"nothing I ever did took that feeling away.\\"  Also, he explains how the rhetoric of white supremacy never helped him or the family, but only caused immense amounts of pain.  With this newfound understanding, he chose to leave it all behind.<br />Another emotional moment occurs when Derek and Danny began removing the paraphernalia from Danny's room (note the voiceover of Danny's paper for Sweeney).  Such a moment not only brought them closer together, it also serves, symbolically, as another turning point in not only their respective lives, but the life of their family as well.<br />American History X is a wonderful movie replete with thought-provoking subject matter.  As I viewed the movie, the constant question in my mind was \\"how did this movie bypass the larger movie going public?\\"  Perhaps this observation/oversight is cause for an iteration on what the movie going public really wants to see; maybe next time.<br />Note: the above is part of a work presented in a course on Deviant Behavior and Social Control.construct of race and how he fell into the trap laid by Alexander.

B00005KHJM|5.0|What a film! I first saw it as a young boy, and, without even following it that closely, was horrified. The transformation, as if through time as well as space, of the very human, responsible, modern policeman, to this alien community where virtually nothing can be safely relied upon and the entire community seems to be of one insular and sinister mind, is a powerful one.<br />Watched it again this week for the first time in almost 30 years, and it still lives up to expectations. This film was MADE for Christopher Lee, while Edward Woodward's performance, as what inexorably becomes a bumbling and hapless character, is superb. Britt Ekland and Diane Cilento are real beauties; the other performances and the thread of the storyline are convincingly gripping, and the filming locations together with the 'otherworldly' music augment the film with its essential, mystic qualities.<br />As an enthusiast of Celtic music and customs, I accord that most of the pagan references of the film had some source in what is known, or has been researched, of ancient beliefs and practices amongst these people's pre-Christian ancestors. This brings it closer in some ways to the hypothetical scenario of a community sealed off from Christian and other enlightening influences, but somehow not completely cut off from 20th Century customs. The pagan customs and rituals shown are more evocative of what might have been seen in 'pagan revivals' in more southerly parts of the British Isles, in post-Christian times, and at odds with the spirit and outlook of even the most 'insulated' parts of Highland Scotland, where people were amongst the first to embrace Christianity, and are still guided by its values today. Also, the names of people and places, plus the style of the music, are patently not Gaelic, which the Highlands fundamentally are, while the 'Scottishness' of some of the acting is far from authentic!<br />That said, the film really works, and in many ways it's the bizarreness, almost clumsiness, of these aspects, that make 'Summerisle' so sinister. Compulsive viewing!

But tragedy strikes and his wife and four hundred eggs are wiped out leaving him with only one egg.<br />Marlin is now overly cautious and highly protective of his only child, Nemo.  But when the first day of school arrives Nemo is caught by divers and taken away.<br />With no thought of danger to himself, Marlin leaves the reef and enters the ocean in pursuit of his son.

But the action never stops.<br />This is a very intense movie and my daughter was upset by it (I skipped the opening barracuda scene) as she hates seeing family members separated.  But other kids I know younger than her (4 ½) enjoy the move and are not scared at all.  I recommend parents watch this one first before deciding if it is appropriate for their children.
B000002H33|4.0|..I was eating a beef sandwich. Yes, I was particulatly manly on the day that I first heard this pummeling raucous riot. Tucking into the flesh of a cow, I was, when my ears were blessed, and cursed, with the sounds of the first song on this cd (I don't remember the name).<br />And I was drinking beer.<br />In fact, I'm not sure if the songs were actually good or if beef and beer made them sound tough to me. I felt tough. The music made me want to pick a fight. I went to the local bar and picked a fight, still feeling mighty after the heavy music. He was a tall man with a muscular build. And I lost. And it's the fault of this music.<br />I recommend such local bands as Lynyrd Skynyrd for a kick-back, a relax, and not such a heightened testosteronal state. I lost a tooth!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is considered one of the best (If not the best) Anime' films ever made and its cinematic storytelling at its finest. Not since \\"Akira\\" has an animated film made the impact like this. This was created by the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki who is considered a god in terms of Anime' and its his wonderful stories and imagination that makes him so special. This is the story of a ten year old girl named Chihiro who is traveling with her parents to their new home and she is sad that they have to move. Her father takes what seems like a wrong turn and they come across a structure with a tunnel in the middle. They all get out and walk through to the other side and Chihiro's father recognizes it as an old park that has gone under over the years. They come across another structure with food set out and Chihiro's parents waste no time in helping themselves to as much food as they can eat. Chihiro discovers to her horror that her mother and father have turned into pigs and she runs off to try and find help. She encounters a boy named Haku that takes her into the strange world where spirits and witches habitat and he tells her to find someone named Kamaji and ask for a job. She is looked down on as a human but she manages to find Kamaji who has eight legs like a spider and he gets her a job. Chihiro works with Lin who is an older female and she shows her what to do and where to sleep. Chihiro helps out cleaning and delivering but at night she sneaks out to talk with Haku who is helping her get her parents back and to be able to go home.<br />Miyazaki has such a broad sense of imagination and this is reflected in his other films like \\"Princess Mononoke\\" and \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" and this film is probably even greater than those two. This film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and it certainly deserved it. One of the joys of watching Miyazaki's films is that you have no idea what so ever has to what will happen next. The characters and events take the viewer on a strange and fantastic voyage that has never been seen before. Yubaba the witch has a giant baby named Boh, Haku turns into a flying dragon and Kamaji has these dustball/spider things carry lumps of coal to a furnace that heats everything. One of the big highlights of this film is the \\"Stink Spirit\\" that is this giant glob of river mud and Chihiro helps it get clean. While she does this she helps pull out all the junk (Bicycles, assorted metal, etc..) until we see what this spirit really looks like. This is the type of animated feature that children should view and this is not to knock American animated films but the Japanese concern themselves more with the stories. Children should view films that will enhance they're imagination but unfortunately most of the crap they are forced to watch is usually something that they can guess as to what will happen next. Miyazaki had no plans to make another film but happily he is working on another one! This is a great animated film and it should be recommended viewing for children although adults will love this also.
B000002U82|5.0|This album I would rate as one of the two greatest albums of all time. In my lifetime I have never heard anything that is on the level of perfect as Dark Side of the Moon and Miles Davis' Kind of Blue. This is something to pick up.
B000002J6F|4.0|Great to have this recording on CD. For me it's very close to being a classic 70's recording, and if you like Stills' songwriting, voice, and guitar work, this is a great collection. <BR>In fact it's the best work Stills ever did. I have a feeling that Chris Hillman deserves more credit than is ever given him for the more successful moments throughout. It is Stills' show, but the band is topnotch. At times the instrumentation is overdone (trying to keep 7 players busy I guess), and the intonation of the vocals sounds a little flat a few times, but there are some great songs here, superb guitar playing, and the band sounds alive and spirited throughout (a treat to hear in the era of digital sound).
B0000DD7LB|1.0|So, I listened to the clips on this site. Then, I went to her web site and checked out THOSE clips, and THEN I decided to borrow the CD from a friend and listen to it.<br />Personally, I don't like her style, her dancing, much less how she approaches things. She DOES have an okay voice though... The songs DID get stuck in my head, but it REALLY got annoying after a while. And, the songs were written in a good mannor, needs to improvise on the lyrics but that's pretty much it. I congradulate the person who sat there and wrote all of this, because BS (and BELIVE me BS DOESN'T stand for Britney Spears) definatlly didn't write it.<br />She needs to get up and get some style, because she's a bore. I don't know how she stuck around for SO long, but she did. \\"Her music\\" is better than before (minus most of the lyrics) when she was also COMPLETELY stupid, now she's only semi-idiotic. <br />The main flop in this album? Her voice seemed to be changed around WAY too much! She sounded like a computer almost all of the time.<br />To put it plainly, BS sux. But whoever wrote the stuff knows how to make a melody... <br />-_-And that stupid kiss with Madonna did nothing for her. It just gave me even MORE of a reason to think of her as a complete slut. Loosing her virginity to Justin?! My ass...
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is an extremely talented rapper and producer.  Another reviewer uses the word refreshing, and that's exactly what this album is.  The beats are great and Kanye's lyrics are very, very clever with many witty references to pop culture. When I first bought the album I figured that Through the Wire was probably going to be the sole bright spot, not so. It seems like every track on here is my favorite, I can listen to the entire album without skipping any tracks (ok occasionally I will skip the short skits :P) and I have been listening to this album repeatedly in my car, at home, on the job. It never gets old, it's that good. Pick this album up, this is one rapper that definitely deserves your dollars.
B00012QM8G|2.0|This is a wonderful movie, one of the best made, but the DVD has some problems.  This first copy I bought froze up towards the end of chapter 16.  I returned this copy and received another one which happens to freeze in the exact same spot.  Neither copy had any surface scratches.  Has anyone else noticed this problem?
B00005JMNA|5.0|this movie was incredible...my mother being of american descent and my father, a cuban native who lived there during the time when this movie is set to take place, i felt a certain closeness with this movie.  i could completely relate, and i was at the edge of my seat trying to hold back the urge in me that wanted to get up and dance.  i had bought the soundtrack even before i saw the movie because i knew it had to be good, and i wasn't the least bit dissappointed with the soundtrack, or the movie.  i recommend it for anyone who wants to see the total power and passion of love and life...and of course, cuba!
0800139151|5.0|The Quick And The Dead is my favourite film of all time. It is a classic film, with an amazing narrative and an incredible cast. Sharon Stone is fantastic in it.
B00008XEOI|5.0|This is an excellent DVD with plenty of special features. I just wanted to point out that despite how the wording sounds on the Collector's DVD Gift Set, the NINE sketches that you get are only lithograph prints of sketches. I found this out months after getting my DVD the day it was released.<BR>Still, the extra cost of this set did seem a tad low to have original sketches anyway. You get 9 wonderful prints that are 5x7&quot; each, plus an excellent 160 page HARDBACK booklet. You get your money's worth, no doubt about it. I currently have the sketches in a landscape frame behind my desk in my bedroom/office and they look really nice.
0684833395|5.0|A novel that can make you laugh at one moment and make you cry at another is a true work of genius.  Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22, is renown for being one of the greatest satirical war novels of all time.  Heller's novel possesses great depth.  The book is obviously anti-war but it also attacks many other problems that lie within our society.  Heller attacks bureaucracies, capitalistic corporations, and other organizations that use individuals to benefit themselves.  Heller's novel is directed to anyone who is fed up with being used as a tool of success for another person.  The book is directed to anyone who is against war.  Catch-22 is also directed to anyone who wants a laugh.  In his novel, Catch-22, Joseph Heller successfully portrays an anti-war masterpiece using humor, corruption, and hope. <br />In order for someone to fully understand Catch-22, he or she must understand the context of the novel.  This novel was written in the 1950's.  This was a time where many Americans viewed World War II as a heroic success.  Those involved in the combat had differing views on the subject.  Joseph Heller was a bombardier for the Air Force during World War II.  Catch-22 is based largely on Heller's experiences in the war.  Through his novel, Heller is expressing his detest for war.  An element that one must take into account when reading Heller's novel is that he wrote Catch-22 using extreme satire.  The reader must not take everything written seriously or he or she will not grasp the message Heller is trying to convey.<br />Heller's novel Catch-22 revolves primarily around the actions and feelings of the protagonist, Yossarian.  Yossarian desperately wants to be grounded.  He can't be grounded though because he asked to be.  Since he asked to be grounded that proved that he was indeed sane.  If a man was insane he would want to fly more missions, therefore he could be grounded.  Even if a man were insane and decided to ask to be grounded he could not be since he askedto be grounded therefore proving that he is actually sane.  The preceding passage describes Catch-22.  \\"Doc Daneeka replied, `Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy\\" (55).  Yossarian spends most of the novel faking illnesses and finding other ways to get out of flying.  It is near the end of the novel when Yossarian takes a walk through the eternal city of Rome.  Yossarian is in Nately's whore's apartment with all of the girls (prostitutes) missing except for one old lady.  This lady explains another aspect of Catch-22. \\"Catch-22 says they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing\\" (417). The woman is referring to how the soldiers came and took all of the girls from the apartment.  Once the woman says this to Yossarian he realizes that Catch-22 doesn't truly exist.  It is an inexistent rule used to control people.  After Yossarian realizes this he retreats to the city where he sees all of the horrors of the world.  It is in Rome where he is arrested for being in the city without a pass.  After he is arrested, Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn gave Yossarian a proposal.  They will send him back to the States if he pretends to promote the war. \\"Be our pal. Say nice thing about us here and back in the States. Become one of the boys. Now, that isn't asking too much, is it?\\" (436).  Yossarian accepts the proposal but breaks it.  He cannot promote the war effort.  Instead Yossarian decides to run away to Sweden.  Yossarian runs because he can no longer be controlled and is ready to live a life of freedom.<br />There is no doubt to whether Heller successfully executed his goals in writing this novel.  It is evident through his writing that Heller truly detested the war and everything about it.  He successfully uses humor in discussing a controversial issue.  Catch-22 suggests many problems within the United States Militia.  One of these problems is the traumatic affect of combat on soldiers.  This idea is present through Yossarian and Snowden.  Snowden was a young bombardier who died in Yossarian's arms.  In result, Yossarian is always having flashbacks to the moment of Snowden's death.  Although Heller's novel covered many issues it didn't touch on many common themes within war novels.  One idea that is not present in Heller's writing in patriotism.  None of the men in the novel act like they are fighting for their country. They don't show pride in what they do.  This can be expected though since it is an anti-war novel.  Heller distinguishes himself from other anti- war novelists in the sense of style.  Unlike others, Heller uses satire to express his feelings on war.  <br />Although Heller's novel is entertaining and comical I don't entirely agree with his stance on issues regarding war.  Through his writing Heller seems to find everything about war to be wrong.  I personally feel that war is indeed wrong but is essential at crucial times.  It seems as though Heller feels war is the worse thing on the face of the earth.<br />In his novel, Catch-22, Joseph Heller successfully displays his beliefs on war.  He touches on ideas such as corruption, deception, and violence in his novel.  Heller was one of the first people to write an anti-war novel and did so even though he was a former member of the Air Force.  Heller uses satire magnificently to illuminate on certain idiotic aspects of war.  Catch-22 is a masterpiece of literature and everyone owes it to themselves to read it.
0385504209|5.0|It's still an edge of the seat novel.  That's why you buy a mystery like this.  The interesting thing is that everyone wants to talk about whether it is or isn't Mary Magdalene in the Last Supper, but they don't want to talk about the Catholic Church burning over 5 million women at the stake over 3 centuries during the Inquisition.  And why does the person in a picture controversy drag the book down to a single star?  What a bunch of idiots.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Everything about this album is ingenius. This is he reason why i love Opeth. <br />&quot;Wreath&quot; is my least favorite track, mainly because of it's intense drums and its relentlessness<br />&quot;Deliverance&quot; is classic Opeth, opening up to intensity, and with slow beauty in the middle, and ending with a part that may seem repetative, but it really grows on me because of the background guitar.<br />&quot;A Fair Judgement&quot; is one of my favorite opeth track since orchid. It can even be likable by non-metalheads. here is no gutteral voice, just Mikael doing what I think he does best, his beautiful softer voice, but..not to be outshined by the guitar that is amazing in this song.<br />&quot;For Absent Friends&quot; is the intermission of the CD, but not to be taken as such, beause it is a master of work and so beautiful in every way.<br />&quot;Masters Apprentice&quot; is insane as hell at the beginning, i love it. I believe that the softer part is the best, because of its jolt into electricity when Mikael turns into the monster. This is Beautiful. My Favorite with the gutteral voice.<br />&quot;By The Pain I See In Others&quot; is just as intense as the prior songs, but..somehow more catchy than any other opeth. The end gets weird and back to the presumptuousness of opeth, that is well deserved. Ihope to god that Opeth proves themselves to be actual gods, and never die.
B000002UAR|5.0|Best Beatles album period. But you don't need to read the extraordinarily long diatribes below to figure that out. Just listen and love!
B00009RDGA|5.0|ive read a few people comment on how tatum isnt a great actress but you have to keep in mind that tatum oneal was very young in this movie.  <BR>in all this movies been one of my top 3 movies since i was a small child.  if your a big fan of Paper Moon id suggest seeing matchstick men.  it just came out..
B0000BXGCN|5.0|This CD will captivate your heart in so many ways. The songs are stripped to the core and re-invented making them sound fresh and ambient. The CD is basically Lara, the piano along with a string quartet. I might add the pianist, Pierre, is unbelievable. You can feel the emotion pouring through on this record. A must buy!
B000002JSJ|5.0|Presence is an increadible expression of Led Zeppelin's pure talent and experience as musicians. This album contains several tight, experimental tracks such as: Royal Orleans, Candy Store Rock, and the classic Nobody's Fault But Mine. Tea For One is one of the least recognized Led Zeppelin songs, and it must be heard by any fan of spacey, hard rock. However, none of the songs embody the &quot;presence&quot; of this album better than Achilles Last Stand. Achilles Last Stand is an amazing ten and a half minutes of pure kick-ass rock! It is definately the highest point of the album and my personal favorite Zeppelin track of all time.
0385510438|2.0|Not your typical Grisham novel.  It lacked quite a bit of the detail you normally expect from him.  He spent quite a bit of time weaving characters and events into the story that never really added anything.  It just seems to meander.  I'll buy his next book and hope he wakes up in time before he becomes another James Patterson.
B000000OAN|5.0|This is definetely one of the best Queen albums ever. I would pick these earlier Queen albums (Queen, Queen II, Sheer Heart Attack or A.N.A.T.O.) over any of the later ones anyday.<br />This one, of course, contains the infamous Bohemian Rhapsody. However, other songs on this CD are just as good, maybe even better.<br />Starting off with Death on Two Legs, a song with very nice arrangements and a very angry, hard-hitting feel. Very nice melodies in this song too. Going on to Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon... well... it's hilarious! It's the campiest, and most ludicrous song ever. It's great, though, and the harmonized solo at the end is amazing. <br />&quot;I'm In Love with my Car&quot; is a great song, but I must admit, my least favourite of CD. It's good, it just doesn't have that depth that the rest of the album does, but it's still a great rock song. <br />&quot;You're my Best Friend&quot; - Great follow up hit to Bohemian Rhapsody, nice song by John Deacon. I love the melodies and harmony parts.<br />&quot; '39 &quot; - Great skiffle (folk) song. I love the melody, and Brian's singing. For those who didn't know, Brian (the guitarist) sings instead of Freddie and his voice suits this song so well. Very sad song, but another contender for best song off this CD<br />&quot;Sweet Lady&quot; - Pretty much the same deal as &quot;I'm in love with my Car&quot;. It just doesn't do much for me, but again, a good rock song.<br />&quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot; - A lovely song, again very &quot;silly&quot; if you will, but amazing melody and story-telling feel. Got to love those kazoos. <br />&quot;Prophet's Song&quot; - Wow. That's all I could say. It's just as impressive as Bohemian Rhapsody in my eyes and often too overlooked. It's a great song, amazing vocals. Especially in that vocal break. I'm blown away over and over again by this song. <br />&quot;Love of My Life&quot; - Great, sad yet happy song. Again melody and harmony's there. Freddie outdid himself here. Great song. <br />&quot;Good Company&quot; - A good partner with Seaside Rendezvous, but this one was written by Brian May... great arrangements again, nice song... <br />Bohemian Rhapsody - One could go on and on about this song. Everyone's heard it. Amazingly complex arrangements and amazing melodies. Impressive vocals, great guitar playing. I wont' dwell too long, everyone knows this song is great. <br />God Save the Queen - Nice outro song, wonderful harmonized guitar arrangements of the British Nat'l Anthem. <br />Bottom Line: Go buy this CD. It will blow you away. And look into some earlier Queen CD's too. I've said this before: If you like Queen, but you don't like older Queen, then you don't like Queen. If that makes any sense... Buy IT!!!
0385510438|4.0|Not familiar with Grisham's work other than the fact that he seems suspiciously prolific, I wasn't expecting anything particularly special.  Therefore, I was very plesantly surprised by how well written, compelling and seemingly personal this very entertaining story turned out to be.<br />Great for that long plane ride or to take along on vacation, this smartly written story which says quite a bit about the author's sensitive impressions of the world around him, will keep you interested every chapter of the way.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Tomb Raider really is a good cross between a video game &amp; a movie.  It has the titillation, the roller coaster rides, the wonderful stretches into serious fantasy, etc.  I personally also really like the &quot;wire work&quot; which looks like wire work - the movie doesn't try to give the impression that stuff is real.  It's a fun flic to watch, if you accept it for with it is (&amp; sit back &amp; enjoy the ride as the phrase goes, in a mellow non-serious way).  I give it 4.5 stars (and I really don't like the 2nd movie - they lost touch with what made the 1st movie kind of special)
B000009EUM|5.0|been a fan on the band since 1985.  when i heard scoundrel days was out I had to have it.  I was amazed at how it varied on theme from the frist and it was vastly more intense.  the flow of the album is just incredible and Morton's voice, as always, gives you chills listening.  Scoundrel Days is a superb album and great to listen to at night.  If you are just looking into the band after their amazing &quot;Take on Me&quot; hit, this is the next album ..... BUY IT. (then start getting each one in release order)
B0000584V3|5.0|This is my very first Opeth album, and I have to say, at first I was a little wary of the label &quot;progressive death metal.&quot;  But having overcome that stigma (what's in a name, after all?) I picked up this disc from the local Best Buy, took it home, popped it in and fell in love immediately!  The guitar riffs are high-energy, and make you want to jump out of your seat at times.  The acoustic riffs I find highly to my liking, as they compose a sort of cold, lonely feeling.  After all, music, like art, is meant to embody emotion, isn't it?  And this album does it perfectly!  I remember listening to &quot;Harvest&quot; for the first time and finding myself at the verge of tears when confronted with the cold, lonely feeling it brought forth.  In short, this disc is highly recommended!  Now I have to work on getting all the other albums.
B00008PC2O|1.0|Im really disapoined to see that a new format supported by Artisan and Microsoft have a downloadble Trailer that can run here in Brazil and the Extreme DVD cannot.. Why that?

0141301155|4.0|This story begins with a poor boy named Charlie. He loves chocolates but can only afford one per year. One day, his grandpa, Grandpa Joe, tell him of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Willy Wonka made many inventions in that factory of his. But for years, the factory has never been activated. It was then when there was an announcement. There were five hidden gold tickets in five candy bars from all over the entire world. Charlie and his Grandpa buy one with their money but doesn't find it at all. A few days have gone by and time was running out. One day, Charlie was looking down at the snow and saw some paper. He picked it up and found out that it was one whole dollar! He went to a candy store and bought a candy bar. He bought one more and a gold light hit his face. Could it be? It Was! He found the fifth golden ticket! Then the next day, he went to the chocolate factory. He saw many magical stuff in this factory. Then, when he came home, he had a lifetime supply of chocolate bars.<BR>     There was a few things that i enjoyed about this book. First of all, Charlie never got mad when he didn't get the golden ticket. He just laughed a good laugh about it. This was one of the good parts because it shows that the main character is kind hearted. Second of all, all the things that happened were very creative. Charlie finds a dollar miraculously and has permission to go into the chocolate factory.Many things happen to him in this factory and he finds many interesting of Willy Wonka.<BR>     I also enjoyed this book because the main character was poor. If he was rich, there would really be no point because he can just buy chocolate bars with no problem at all. But when you're poor, it would take a miracle just to be able to buy 3. This is what made me interested. Also, it has many interesting inventions. For example, gum that never loses its flavor, ice cream that never melts, etc. This book is very interesting and once you read it, you'll wish there was a sequel to it.
B00006BTCA|5.0|When a friend first played the 1st 35 seconds of the album, I was hooked. I kid you not. Never before has an an album intrigued me and captivated me before such as Interpol has done with their debut album. Although compared to bands and era's before them, I still feel they are in  a league of their own. The album has a dark, meloncholy feel to it yet also has an upbeat vibe that keeps you listening to each song over and over. I am pretty picky about music these days yet Interpol has blown my mind with each track and I am anxiously awaiting their next album.
B000084T18|5.0|This is a great album it Is 50 Cent's BEST. It has alot of hits like 21 Questions, In Da Club, and WANKSTA. This whole album is great.
B00006879E|5.0|&quot;Harder To Breathe&quot; (the first single) was what drew me to this group! The lead singer had such a unique voice, I really like it! I heard the second single &quot;This Love&quot; and liked that as well. So, I purchased the CD. I was very impressed! There is not one single song on here that I do not like or that I skip over when I listen to it through. Very good songs all the way through!
B0000029GA|5.0|This is A AWESOME ALBUM. It is a CLASSIC. 10 stars for the RHYMES 10 Stars for the LYRICS, 10 FOR THE GUESTS Makes It A 5 STAR Album
B0000019PA|5.0|I once tried to describe this album to a friend and after floundering for awhile abjectly failed to do so. It is a recording that is very difficult to categorize, and that is one of the many things I love about it, especially given the pigeonholing of artists that seems to be the norm in music these days. There are certainly elements of indie pop here, as well as acoustic folk, and what sounds like strangely warped marching band music, and underpinning it all is Jeff Mangum's intense vocal performance. I get shivers listening to his voice cracking over the high notes of &quot;Two-Headed Boy&quot; - you can just feel him putting all the lung-bursting intensity he can muster into the song. &quot;Oh Comely&quot; is an epic masterpiece containing some of the best lyrics I've ever heard. The whole album is chock full of melodic hooks and seems to flow effortlessly from one song to the next. It's rare to find an album without at least one throwaway track, but this is one of them. Yes, it sounds a little strange at first, but after listening a couple of times one realizes it only adds to the allure. Fantastic stuff.

0151003084|5.0|Edward Gorey's dark subversion of children's alphabet books is a tiny book guaranteed to bring a sinister smile to the face of every one with a twisted sense of humor.  Opening with &#34;A is for Amy who fell down the stairs&#34; and running all the way to &#34;Z is for Zilla who drank too much gin,&#34; the simple but inspired rhymes combine with Gorey's pseudo-Victorian Gothic crosshatch illustrations to wickedly funny effect.<br /><br />Although his disaster-specific illustrations (such as &#34;R is Rhoda consumed by a fire&#34;) are macabrely witty, Gorey is really at his best when he leaves the most to your imagination.  Consequently, it is really his illustrations of impending doom (&#34;P is for Prue trampled flat in a brawl&#34;) or the shocking aftermath of an unknown circumstance (&#34;K is for Kate who was struck with an ax&#34;) that are most likely to inspire a mischievous grin.<br /><br />Although you might not want to give this to your anxiety-prone niece or your traumatized stepson as a Christmas stocking stuffer unless you wish to make them worry about your intent, older children will likely find it every bit as comical as adults--but adults are the real audience here, much more likely to catch the drop-dead humor involved.

076781326X|5.0|\\"Oliver!\\" is the first musical I ever came to love, to learn the words to, and to want to see again. When people think of this wonderful adaptation of Charles Dickens' dark and occasionally hopeful \\"Oliver Twist,\\" the music might come first to mind. Why wouldn't it? The songs are remarkable, and worth ever acclaim. Take away the music (and I hope you never would), and there is left a strong story with a strong message played by strong actors, all well-produced.<br /><br />The younger viewers will see the trials and tribulations of Oliver Twist. Older viewers will connect with Nancy or Bill Sikes, or look deep into the tyranny of poverty and those who would profit from the vulnerable poor.<br /><br />Ron Moody is the star as Fagin, but a not often talked about enough performance of Jack Wild's Artful Dodger. He has an insightfulness and an almost innocent prying likeability that infects audiences. He's a thief, working for the top thief, and trying to involve young and lonely Oliver, but only so to protect him and befriend him.<br /><br />Peggy Mount is endearing as Mrs. Bumble, with a personality not unlike Mrs. Butterworth of pancake syrup fame.<br /><br />The tone is ironically whimsical, demonstrating a contrast in the tenor of the rich and poor, of those singing and those in need.<br /><br />The settings are impressively realistic, keeping in mind the time this was produced. Not as big budget as epics like \\"The Ten Commandments,\\" it still can carry the audience into believing they were really there. We see the humanity behind the poor culture of London. We see the tragedies of lives that could have been beautiful, and grimace with the fates of some.<br /><br />Even though the music is fun and memorable, so is the not as happy message. Across England, homeless children were being abused and put into near-slavery in a black-market pickpocket scheme. Dickens took what he saw around him and developed one of the English's most compelling literary social statements.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Oliver!\\" To balance out your classic Victorian England DVD musical collection, try \\"My Fair Lady,\\" with Audrey Hepburn.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comr classic Victorian England DVD musical collection, try \\"My Fair Lady,\\" with Audrey Hepburn.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is like passing a horrible car accident. You don't want to look, but yu do. This film is one of the most outstandig films I have ever seen! Ellen Burnstyn shuld have won the Academy Award. And the supporting cast is just as gripping! The film centers around a group of people who's lives are literally destroyed by drugs, both illegal and precribed.Seeing ths type of life first-hand through my brother and also friends, this films nails the truth behind drug addiction and the lives it can destroy! SO much has been said in all these reviews, so all I can say is BUY THIS FILM!
6305784116|3.0|I like &quot;The Aristocats.&quot;  Granted, it isn't a great film nor does it have &quot;cutting edge&quot; animation that today's generation has come to take for granted, but it is a good story with some fun songs in it that make it worth watching.<br />It was created back when Disney movies were made for the sake of being made.  It wasn't made to gross millions of dollars in profit.  It wasn't a vehicle for a new Disney Channel series.  It didn't try to teach you some great moral lesson.  It was simply made to entertain, and that is what it does.<br />Younger children will definitely love this film.  The songs are fun to sing and there is enough silly action to hold any two-year old's attention.  Adults, especially between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, may grow a little tired of this movie because they may not be used to a film that isn't tied in with some type of toy line or ride at Disneyworld.  Older adults will probably like it for the simple fact that it provides nostalgia.<br />Don't pass this one by.  Get it and enjoy it with your family.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is the best heavy Metal record ever period!
B000002672|4.0|When I first heard Accept, I thought who in the world could listen to this guy (Udo) sing for any period of time without going crazy. Udo sounds like a mix of Bon Scott, Brian Johnson and an evil troll. But somehow his voice grows on you and you can't imagine anyone else fronting Accept. (They tried with an album called Eat the Heat and it fails miserably)Russian Roulette is a really good album, with catchy riffs and ominous backing vocals. The guitar work and the flow of the songs on this album remind me a good deal of early 80's Judas Priest. I really like Balls to the Wall, and this album is just as strong. It's interesting listening to Heaven is Hell post 9-11, and right when Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ is going strong in theaters. I believe the stand-out track on this album has to be either Stand Tight or Walking in the Shadows. If you are a fan of heavier 80's metal, along the lines of Judas Priest's Defenders of the Faith, or Iron Maiden's Powerslave, then you should like Russian Roulette as well. Take some time to listen to this under-rated band and give Udo's vocals a chance to work thier magic and you'll soon be an Accept fan too.

As solan said, \\"Her thought process in making valid reasons why she is a compulsive shopper were humourous in the beginning but half way through the book, I was getting tired of having the same old point drilled to me that Rebecca buys things to compensate for self worth.  Confessions is unrealistic...\\"  I disagreed with everything this person said, except that the thought process was humorous.  Still, I thought it was humorous throughout, since Becky had a different excuse each time.  When she was on a money-saving campaign, she used the techniques, such as taking coffee to work in a thermos, as excuses to shop.  In this case, she decided that she needed a nice-looking thermos (preferably from Gucci) to take to work and ends up buying an expensive one.  Also, solan says that Rebecca shops to boost her self-esteem.  I completely disagree.  First of all, I don't think the novel goes that deep.  It's a quick read about a woman who loves to shop.  Personally, I thought she was very comfortable with herself.  She was just very materialistic; her need to buy didn't come from some deep, empty void within her!  It was just a funny twist to a problem many people have: love of material items.  Finally, while I agree that Confessions of a Shopaholic is unrealistic in some regards, I think Kinsella does a nice job of making it sound real.  Becky always has a made-up excuse that ends up sinking her deeper in money troubles.<BR> On the other hand, I did read a review about the plot with which I completely agreed.  \\"It's not the pinnacle of literary achievement; however, I don't believe it was trying to be.  It's exactly what it should be--a fun diversion.  Although I couldn't quite identify with Becky's spending habits, I thought they were hilarious.  But the best thing of this book is that Becky does grow up--not leaps and bounds, but a couple realistic steps towards being a better person.\\"  This person, who calls him or herself steelebjm, is like me in not searching for symbolism in a novel with a bright pink cover and a made-up word in the title.  It was exactly a fun diversion; I read it on the side as I was also reading Les Miserables by Victor Hugo at the same time.  I am a frugal spender, so I couldn't identify directly with Becky's vigorous spending, either, but I could identify with her human characteristics such as procrastination and finding loopholes.  Her shopping was hilarious, and just when I was about to get frustrated with her because I thought she'd never grow as a person, she made a few steps forward in the end.
B0001BKAEE|4.0|This movie I had to see more than once.....only because like some posted earlier I went into the first week expecting too damn much.  Thrown off by a diffent Oracle, and the pace of the movie because of how the last movie to its beginning with a fight scene and Neo flying away.  It then ended with you hanging and saying to yourself \\"Damn this next installment is going to be good\\"!!!  So............thats how I went into it.  After dying my own hype down and others who gave not so good reviews of the movie I watched one and two and then three again and I have to admit.  Everything that has a beginning may not have an end but this left the door wide open.  It was good the movie was \\"attainable and explainable\\" maybe except for the sunrise (which you will see but I wont tell the movie like somebody I wont name who posted earlier).<br />I say give the DVD a chance if you seen it and did not like it in the box office try watching all three at home.
0060512806|4.0|This book was good but I want to write about something else....the reviewers here. Hey you intellectual-elitest morons; stop talking down to everyone that isn't you. It is possible that some of us are just as intellectual and genius as you are (even if we didn't buy the Star Trek: The Next Generation compendium).<BR>Its a book guys. Crypto is not a lifestyle, its not some fun game people play, its crypto. Please go throw yourselves at the next intellectual fad that gets posted on some announcement board at Cal-Berkley.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Man, I remember '93 like it was yesterday (well maybe not).  But I do remember being 13 years old and my mom finding me listening to this tape (yes tape, not CD).  Needless to say I never saw the tape again, but my older cousin gave me a copy of his.  My mom found that tape too, but that's another story.  Even though I really wasn't into hip-hop like that during this time, I remember saying how dope this album was.  Snoop undoubtedly changed the game, as he was the biggest rap star out at this time.  Even in 2004, it still gets played in reg. rotation.  This is straight up Snoop at his best.  This was when he had the best flow in the game with the top record label backing him.  If you've never heard this CD, you must have been born after 1993.  Peace.
B0000027RL|5.0|Albums like these change peoples lives, they are more than the bubble gum, marketed, comemrcial crap on the radio today.  Ed and the gang, show how powerful music can be.  This album is a classic, it changed my life, its a soundtrack to my childhood, Unbelievable, excellent, wonderful, if you dont have this album, run, dont walk, to your nearest cd store

0385335482|4.0|Many people also expect all authors to write similarly, using metaphors, figurative language, and vocabulary words from freshman year reading enrichment classes.  Jamie Feldhusen from San Diego, is one of these such people.  \\"This book is slow, stupid, and unimaginative.  The only people who might like this book are other shopaholics looking for some lame excuse to waste their money.\\"  I completely disagree.  Unimaginative, she says.  One question I would like to ask Jamie is this:  how many authors does she know who write about a grown woman who spirals into debt because she makes up stories, excuses, and clever schemes that eventually keep her away from financial security?  Also, if she was looking for a book that could be read in other ways besides literally, she could read Animal Farm by George Orwell or Lord of the Flies by William Gerald Golding.  Finally, her last argument doesn't even make sense.  Why would people who want to waste their money even care about reading the book, much less liking it?<BR> Nevertheless, there are many people who agree with me.  I think that it should be a light, easy read; it's the type of book you buy at an airplane newsstand to distract you from the smelly, snoring man sitting next to you.  Among the people who agree with me are Saima Huq and kathy11375.  Kathy says, \\"This book is fast-paced, light-hearted, and laugh-out-loud funny.\\"  Saima agrees with all of these comments, as do I.
B0001611DI|5.0|This film is a heavily satiric followup to the 1968 Romero cult film NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD that more than satisfies those hungry for more zombie fun.  While the plot is simply a survival story inside a shopping mall involving 4 hapless national guardsmen, the subtext is a sharp dose of fun-poking at the mindless, consumer-driven &quot;zombies&quot; that populate our nation's malls ad nauseam.  In addition, there is a LOT of gore, violence, cannibalism, and general bad taste (lovingly done though by Savini et al) but it is all accomplished with great flair and deftness.  Another thing - it's more funny than scary, but it works.
6304076517|5.0|I first saw this movie several years ago when I was a sophmore in high school.  I didn't like it at first; I found the scene where Prospero summons the tempest tedious.  And later, when all the nudity began I was mortified (I was watching it with my family and it was just about the first R rated movie I'd ever seen).  But then you forget about the nudity because everyone's nude, even those who wear clothes only do so for ornamentation.  It all seems natural.<BR>As the movie continued I slowly fell in love with it.  The intoxicating music, the imagery.  &quot;How lush and lusty the grass looks.&quot; and it does.  I felt transported to the isle and I felt real regret when Prospero threw away his books at the end.<BR>I can't convey how entranced this movie made me and yet with such a simple joyful plot (which isn't at all hard to get I don't understand what the other reviewers are talking about).  I've watched it more times than any other movie except maybe the Wizard of Oz and Return to Oz as a kid.  And when I'm not watching it I'm listening to the soundtrack.
0385504209|2.0|Artfully written thriller, intelligent and lucid fiction based on... History?! It is the best possible comment to the book &quot;History:Fiction or Science?&quot; that proves consensual History itself to be a complete FICTION!! I enjoyed the reading, but the ideas behind the &quot;Da Vinci-Code&quot; are erroneous and misleading. Why should we allow to be made a fool of?

I love 'feelin way too damn good', and 'because of you', although they are all good.  Anyone who likes their more famous songs, will love this album.
0679879269|3.0|I'll be the first to admit Pullman's trilogy is fantastic, but more on the merits of the first two books than the resolution in this disappointing novel. <br />Obviously, if you're hooked on the first two, it's a must read, but Pullman set too many goals, established too many expectations which fall flat. A similiar problem occurs in his Sally Lockhart trilogy--he is adept at creating such peril, such need in a reader, that it is impossible to create an ending that can satisfy.<br />The problem here is that most of the promises made are either forgotten or diminished *SPOILER ALERT!* Mary is said to be the tempter, the means of luring Lyra to do that which the church fears (becoming a sort of \\"Eve\\")...but Mary does nothing that influences them, and even the Amber Spyglass does nothing that affects the outcome of the story. Mary's entire journey is ultimately pointless, and wastes valuable time. Lyra too is supposed to be an \\"Eve\\" but nothing happens. Characters come and go and are forgotten. Issues are started and, when Pullman realizes they're going nowhere, left to fall flat. So many questions are left unanswered.<br />Instead of meeting those urgent emotional needs created by the first two books, The Amber Spyglass loses its focus, becomes a preachy diatribe of an agnostic's dislike of organized religion, and, in the end, nothing is really changed from the beginning.<br />A letdown, but not enough to avoid reading the book. I hope Pullman visits this world again and, perhaps, allow his editor to help out a little more next time.
B00006690G|5.0|Time and time again, I find these Amazon CD review pages ridden with angry hate messages about the artist's character or factor not at all involving their album or their music. Odawg (the last person who reviewed before me) is a prime example as he gives this album 1 star because the artist is white and &quot;doesn't live in the ghetto.&quot; Great reasoning, but do you realize that not everyone lives in Compton and that music can come from all people of all races and walks of life??? <br />Back to the album (what this page is supposed to be about), this is a great CD by anyone's standards except for Eminem's. This would be an amazing accomplishment for anyone, but for Em its just aight. His debut Slim Shady LP was by far his best work, and Marshall Mathers was excellent but a step down. This is yet another notch lower -- but still very good!
0142000663|5.0|If you give the book a chance it will change you in ways you never before dreamed of.  The Grapes of Wrath stacks up in its theme and scope to the greatest world novels, such as Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, Of Human Bondage, War and Peace.  Its scope and theme are universal.  Its ultimate message: Human dignity and suffering.  If the Grapes of Wrath doesn't stir and shake you, check your pulse.  A powerful and arresting masterpiece that should be required reading for anyone who considers themselves a member of the human race, and who has ever suffered deeply and wishes to be healed by the power of humanity.  Read it and treasure it.
0440234743|5.0|In the testament, John Grisham cleverly combines legal thrill with an adventure into the jungles of Brazil and with an special touch of religious teachings. (How can the title &quot;The Testament&quot; be more appropriate?)<br />Troy Phelan left a holographic will that bewildered his offspring, leaving them with nothing out of the eleven billion.  With an exception, Rachel Lane his illegitimate daughter; who is serving as a missionary deep in the jungle of Brazil was given the fortune.  <br />Nate - a down-and-out lawyer who has been in and out of rehab several times was tasked with the arduous task and adventure to look for Rachel.  This adventure gave him an opportunity to reflect deeply and finally with the help of Rachel found his renewed strength and self.<br />This book probably received a lower rating as the mid-section was filled more with Nate's adventure in the waters of Brazil. There is not much suspense to the books as compared to the others, but the ending came quite as a surprise which nicely concluded the book.<br />If you like an adventure, do pick this title.  It's worth a read!
B00006L83N|5.0|You have to rate this as 5 stars, unless you're a musician in a signed progressive rock band---and you think you can do better.  The musicianship here is stellar, with plenty of hard edge.  The recording quality is excellent.  I don't prefer these kinds of lyics (mythology, fantasy)----however the vocals are great, and perhaps these lyrics are meant as a metaphor that I haven't caught on to yet.  If you like Dream Theater, you'll like Symphony X.

B00009V7RF|2.0|This album is real, real bad... the summer hit &quot;Where is the Love&quot; especially. It sounds like a bunch of cliche catch phrases that were collected and rapped out onto the track. It sounds completely insincere and ridiculous to me. I actually can't help laughing everytime I hear it when I'm driving... &quot;People killing, people dying, children hurt, can you hear them crying, can you practice what you preach, and turn the other cheek&quot; -- I need to stop before I start cracking up again...
B00003JRCQ|5.0|The beauty and innocence of the romance of Anne and Wentworth is captured so wonderfully. The acting is absolutely superb- the subtleties are delightful- and best of all, so faithful to Jane Austen's novel. The music interspersed throughout is so fitting, and the cinemetography breathtaking. Interesting camera work as well. All in all, a completely lovely, witty and enveloping film. I highly recommend it!!
B000089RVX|4.0|I usually don't like these hardcore bands that play on MTV these days, but confess I was surprised when I listened to this &quot;Fallen&quot; CD. The production is awesome and there are lots of intrincate arrangements with choral and keyboards a la Queensryche that enhance the atmosphere created by the voice of Amy Lee, who alternates moments of sweetness and darkness. The lyrics talk about depression and despair. Together with the choral arrangements, this reminds me of late 80's goth bands such as The Cult, The Sisters of Mercy, The Mission and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Of course, these bands sound very old when compared to Evanescence, but the spirit is the same: lyrics about morbid feelings and the alternance of sweet and heavy moments. If the guitar player were a little bit better as a musician and did not interfere in the vocals (what is that in the song &quot;Bring me to Life&quot;?), the band would be perfect.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I've been playng rock guitar for 15 years now.  The bass player in my band always recommended that I give DT a listen---but just listening to one song &quot;in passing&quot; never really grabbed my interest.  I could appreciate their musicianship, but the music sounded too busy and without a readily identifiable pattern.  Finally, I sat down and watched this DVD----and it completely changed the way I write music.  We have shifted from being an &quot;alternative&quot; rock band with alot of 80's feel---to being a &quot;budding&quot; progressive rock band----thanks to this DVD (the Queensryche Mindcrime DVD had something to do with it too).  Each member in Dream Theater is a master at his instrument (including James' voice)-----and this DVD showcases just how much effort goes into the DT sound.  By the way, this DVD compelled me to see DT in concert two times last summer (along with Queensryche and Fates Warning).  SO, if you're ready to be influenced---this is the DVD to get.

B000002B5L|5.0|I just started listening to this album recently after it had been gathering dust for years in my CD collection. STILL such a great album...&quot;Ready or Not&quot; (my favorite track) still sounds just as fresh and enjoyable as it did when I first heard it. And of course Killing Me Softly is a great R&amp;B/hip-hop fused remake. At their prime, the Fugees were the biggest thing in hip-hop, and I think that if they were around today they still would be.
B000060P79|1.0|Please, someone tell me they're kidding me!!!  I'm begging you!!! The song &quot;Perfect&quot; is the absolute most vile piece of bile my unfortunate ears have ever been subjected to.

Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, SAVE ME!!!&quot;  Get over it.  Kids, the &quot;new punk&quot; is READING.  Try that if you want to be subversive.  Try liking a band that ISN'T prepackeged for sale on MTV and the mall record store.  That's subversive.  If you like this band, you are a cog in the wheel.  <BR>Someday you will grow up and realize how incredibly lame you were for liking this band.

0446677450|3.0|I am totally new to investing and I found this book to be a good start and an excellent motivator.  It is filled with many good ideas.  However, I found a lot of repetition that seemed to me unnecessary.  Books don't have to be thick in order to be good.  The author could have stated the valuable messages in only a few chapters.  Nonetheless, though it is repetetive, I found this book very useful.
B00003CXWV|5.0|\\"Blow\\" is based on the true story of George Jung (Johnny Depp in one of his best roles), the loving son of a struggling businessman (Ray Liotta) who, as a child, upon seeing his family struggle to make ends meet and witnessing his mother's (Rachel Griffiths) resentment for his father because of their low income, vows to never be poor.  Thus ensues Jung's descent into the world of drugs.  He begins his three-decade rise and abrupt fall as a drug lord smuggling pot into the US in his early 20's during the pot-crazed 60's, which garners him an enormous amount of cash.  After landing a lengthy jail sentence, he meets Diego Delgado (Jordi Mollà) in jail who introduces George to the far more profitable world of cocaine dealing.  He soon shoots to the top of the game and his biggest problem becomes where to put all of his cash.  It is said that if you used cocaine during the 70's and 80's, there's an 85% chance it came from Jung.  <br />Over the years he struggles with a crack-addicted wife (Penélope Cruz as you've never seen her before), the relationship with his young daughter, and maintaining his relationship with the only person who truly cares for him in the world, his father.  Additionally, Jung is portrayed in a sympathetic light as a nice guy who just makes some bad decisions.  Usually I disagree with this type of \\"glamorization\\" of criminals, but I feel that in Jung's case it is truly deserved.<br />\\"Blow\\" is not only the fascinating, pulse-pounding, and historically informative chronicle of the rise and fall of one of America's most influential drug lords; it also the exploration of some very deep personal connections, such as very deep father/son connection between George and his father.  In addition, George's love for his daughter, who ends up being the single thing motivating him to stay alive throughout his jail sentences, delivers a powerful emotional impact in the film's final scenes.  I also appreciated how director Ted Demme delicately showed us the parallels between George's mother's resentment for his father and George's wife's resentment for him after he loses most of his money as well as George's struggle to be a good father just as his own father did. <br />The final scenes of \\"Blow\\" are surprisingly moving, which ultimately distinguishes it from all of the other crime films out there.
B000005JA8|1.0|1. marked by avoidance of traditional musical tonality; especially : organized without reference to key or tonal center and using the tones of the chromatic scale impartially. <br />The problem arises, in my opinion, when you begin to grasp that beefheart wasn't arriving at this incarnation of &quot;music&quot; via creativity, he was SPECIFICALLY AVOIDING traditional musical tonality.  This means that it's entirely contrived, and not even close to an inspired piece of art.
0446310786|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird<BR>By Harper Lee<BR>Reviewed by: B. Khau<BR>P. 5<br /> Scout Finch is the main character of the book. She lives with Jem and Atticus, her brother and father. She has no mother because her mother died. Scout meets a boy named Dill and they become friends. Scout, her brother, and Dill act out stories together. Dill hears about a house on their street called the Radley Place. One day they find mysterious presents left for them. The children guess that it is from Boo, who is Mr. Nathan Radley's brother. Then one day, the three children sneak into the Radley Place and lots of trouble awaits them there. They get shot at by Nathan Radley, and try to escape. After they escape, a fire breaks and a blanket is slipped onto Scout's shoulders. She thinks that it was Boo and she tells her father about it. After that, Atticus gets involved a trial involved Tom Robinson. Tom was accused of raping a white woman.<BR> I liked this book because there were many surprises in it. One part that surprised me was when the children snuck in the Radley Place and heard a gunshot. \\"Halfway through the collards I tripped; as I tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered the neighborhood.\\" This sentence was from the book and it was described well. It told exactly what happened with good details without confusing the readers. I was getting a little bored because there was not much going on. It didn't have much war and fighting like some of the books I read before. The book had more complicated situations, and was about how some white people could be racist.<BR> Most of the book was interesting although I disliked the fact that this book was pretty long. I had to rush through the book and finish it in time to write this review. I also don't like the way the book has a lot of parts where there is nothing much but conversations and I get bored. An example of this is near the very beginning. \\"We stared at him until he spoke:\\" After that sentence was when I started to get bored. However, there are some parts in the book that you read and suddenly jump up and get really interested.<BR> My favorite part was near the end when Boo saved the kids. It showed how the evil and prejudice in this world can be stopped. Boo stabs Ewell, but he does not get arrested. The sheriff tries to protect Boo and lies that Ewell tripped over a root and stabbed himself.
0395689961|5.0|Cathleen Schine's beguiling voice makes a delightful comedy of manners out of a middle-aged woman's seduction of a college boy.<br />The story opens on a radiant morning in June, the day the letter arrives. Helen MacFarquhar, owner of a small bookstore in seaside Pequot, is pleased with her life, &quot;even with her daughter away at camp and her ex-husband making so much money.&quot; Conscious of her contentment, she regards her pile of mail as &quot;a group of strangers with only one thing in common, and that one thing was Helen MacFarquhar.&quot;<br />Among the letters, bills and solicitations is a note from her daughter, Emily, sent before her departure, beginning, &quot;I bet I miss you already! Smiling, Helen disposes of her mail piece by piece and only then notices an oddly folded sheet. Beginning &quot;Dear Goat,&quot; and signed &quot;Ram,&quot; it's a love letter, typed, undated, anonymous. &quot;A sudden warmth pressed upon her, unfamiliar, a tenderness, someone else's tenderness.&quot;<br />Initially certain the letter was sent to another, she is as quickly uncertain. Helen, a flirt, has many admirers. &quot;They were a kind of hobby, better even than gardening, which she also enjoyed.&quot; She locks the letter in a drawer, takes it out, rereads it, takes it home with her. Soon she has it memorized.<br />Johnny, 20, three weeks into his summer job at Helen's store, watches her when he can get away with it. He's watching as she locks the letter away. &quot;He was not surprised when she caught his eye, and said 'Yes?' in a poisonous voice.&quot; He finds Helen mercurial, dictatorial and fascinating. She often speaks to embarrass him, &quot;to keep him in his place, which seemed to be the same as everyone's place - at her feet.&quot;<br />On a whim - Johnny's parents are away - Helen makes a project of him, invites him to dinner, attempts to set him up with one of her other student employees. Johnny, who has watched her turn on the high wattage charm for her customers and just as quickly switch it off, is flattered, then infuriated when she does it to him. He comes across the letter (accidentally?) and he too is infected by it.<br />Then one day, in her helpful mode, Helen comes upon him in his backyard, wakes him, and in a vulnerable moment he grabs her. Startled, Helen responds. She initiates their love affair which soon consumes them both.<br />Meanwhile, Helen's mother, Lilian, and grandmother, arrive. Lilian, a cosmopolitan charmer who hates small-town Pequot, has come for  an extended visit, perhaps to live. Harried and baffled, Helen scarcely notices her mother's odd comings and goings, too absorbed in snatching moments with Johnny. But it's not merely self-absorption which blinds Helen - her mother's secret is not one easily penetrated by a daughter.<br />Helen agonizes over Johnny. It will end when Emily comes home from camp. It will end when Johnny goes back to school.

And her secondary characters - the librarian Miss Skattergoods, with her eccentric habits and her underlying melancholy, Helen's friend Lucy with her distant manner and her incisive tongue, Helen's grandmother who won't part with her unreliable Jaguar and won't drive it either - each of them is lovingly defined.<br />&quot;The Love Letter&quot; is even finer than &quot;Rameau's Niece&quot;. Dealing with some of the same themes, specifically imagination's role in erotocism, it is more of a whole and has none of the previous novel's occasional heavy-handedness.
0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is definitely now one of my favorite literature novels that I have read in English class.  This book was one that I could actually picture in my head and imagine what was really happening in the story.  I found myself not wanting to put it down until I finished reading it completely.  George and Lenny, otherwise known as John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, were great characters and each perfect for the part that they contributed in the story.  These two characters had a remarkable relationship and the way Steinbeck portrayed it told me a lot.  They shared good times, bad times, and sad times together, but no matter what, there was still a connection between them.  Though I was required to read it I am now very thankful that I did.  It was a great novel and I would honestly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good piece of literature.
0783227434|4.0|Proving you can't keep a good deadite slayer down, Army of Darkness marks the return of Ash in the third film of the highly popular Evil Dead trilogy. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is no longer confined to the isolated cabin in the woods, now that he's been transported to the 14th century (don't ask), apparently somewhere in England. He's seen as an enemy by the local Lord Arthur, but quickly becomes hero and savior to the people when he kills a couple of deadites. Consequently, and in order to return to his time, he's sent on a quest to retrieve the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead. What should be a simple task results in the creation of the army of darkness, which Ash must battle to keep evil from spreading throughout the land.<br />Army of Darkness' plot is pure nonsense, sort of a mix of Monty Python and just about every fantasy movie you may have seen. The entire movie's success is based on humor, and it delivers with consistent comic ingenuity. All traces of horror its predecessors had is all but gone here, those expecting to experience terror with their mirth will be sorely disappointed. Army of Darkness is a silly comedy from beginning to end, and it revels in its silliness.<br />Easily the movie's anchor and probably the only reason I couldn't stop giggling for all 81 minutes is cult fave and comic genius Bruce Campbell. Roles of this kind are perfectly suited for him, and he doesn't disappoint. Whether it's his sharp one-liners, priceless facial reactions, or general good-nature about making a complete fool of himself, Campbell is hilarious as Ash. This is undoubtedly my favorite performance of his, period.<br />Director Sam Raimi shows off his usual kinetic style, delivering plenty of zooms and swirling camera movements. Most of the action sequences (and there are a LOT of them) are played equally for laughs and thrills, but probably succeed at the former slightly more successfully than the latter. The only movie I can think of that managed to keep its action completely thrilling while consistently mingled with silly physical humor is Stephen Sommers' The Mummy (which obviously gained inspiration from this movie)(Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade also accomplished the task, but boasted better and less silly physical gags).  <br />As much as I enjoyed Army of Darkness, it's not as if though the movie couldn't have been improved. Some jokes fall flat and the concept of Ash fighting his evil twin hardly lives up to its full potential. While the intentionally cheesy and fun special effects and make-up effects are perfectly suited for the film, I would have preferred more sets. Most of the movie is based around one castle (albeit a very large one), without even a small village surrounding it; kind of gives off that low-budget vibe (though it's easily the most expensive of the Evil Dead series).<br />The director's cut attaches another fifteen minutes to the movie, most of which neither hampers the movie nor enhances its enjoyment. In fact, I would have welcomed this 96-minute cut if not for the alternate ending, which may be more in tone with the trilogy, but doesn't measure up to the hilarious S-Mart finale of the theatrical cut. As far as comparison with its predecessors, it's different enough in tone to not warrant any comparisons, but what the hell, I'll give one, anyway. Army of Darkness is more consistently enjoyable than Evil Dead 2 (which wasn't scary and only sporadically funny), but not up to par with the original The Evil Dead (which remains one of the most frightening films I've ever seen).
B000002J27|5.0|Ill be the first to admit that I really  wasn't  aware of Genesis music until I first heard   Follow Me Follow You   when it first hit  the American Airwaves  but a few years back I finally discovered there albums before, And Then There Were Three and even though this was there first album without Peter Gabriel its  considered my favorite Genesis Album of All Time with my favorites  like Mad Man Moon , Entangled, Ripples & A  Trick of the Tail !!!! Little did we know that Phil Collins ( although many thought Phil was just a temporary Lead Vocalist until one was  found)  that he would take us into a new phase of Genesis !!!

B000063Y8F|5.0|This impressive piece of hardware feels like anything but a kitchen tool - more like surgical or scientific equipment.<br />I've owned several cheaper garlic presses and rarely used them.  The amount of time saved in the kitchen was lost when trying to clean the gadget.<br />By contract; The Rosle press works flawlessly and cleans easily.  This is the only Rosle tool I own - most of the rest seem either over-engineered or impractical.  <br />The genius lies in the flip-up press plate that allows you to instantly clear the plate and load another clove.<br />Bottom line:  This is a tool that will get used, since it works flawlessly and stays clean easily.
B000067G3C|5.0|Keanu Reeves is a rarity: he's a second-rate actor (at least compared to other big movie stars like Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford) who has kept his career afloat courtesy of a critically and commercially successful film every now and then. These films usually have the tendency to keep his big-screen acting career going steady for another four to five years, by which then he somehow latches on to another big hit. I hear he's going to be starring in the period epic Tripoli, so expect his career to extend to at least 2011.<br />Speed is one such film, his second after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure), but it's one of those much-hyped blockbusters that's actually worth of all the acclaim it's received and then some. Bringing together a highly unlikely cast (Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, and a then unknown Sandra Bullock) and first-time director Jan De Bont, it must have spelled a recipe for disaster. <br />But by miracle or just pure filmmaking bravado (more the latter than the former, though if the film had been made yeseterday, I might be more inclined to agree with the former), they pulled off a great action film, one of the best ever. <br />After beginning with what must be one of the most intense opening credits sequences, the plot quickly gets underway. Mad bomber Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) has just rigged explosives to drop an elevator and its apparently wealthy occupants down quite a few floors to their deaths. But his plan to extort $3.7 million is foiled by quick-thinking LAPD cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his partner (Jeff Daniels, in pretty much the thankless role that really doesn't go anywhere).<br />Out for revenge, Payne raises the stakes further in his ransom demands by rigging a bomb under a city bus. Once the vehicle goes over 50 mph, the bomb will be activated, and once the bus goes below 50, it'll be detonated. Traven makes a mad dash for the bus, arriving after it's already passed 50 mph, but able to keep the bus from going below. Unfortunately, the driver is shot in a mishap, leaving spunky passenger Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) to take the wheel. To make matters worse, they're in the middle of morning rush hour; staying about 50 mph will be almost an impossible task.<br />Speed is divided into essentially three acts and setpieces: the opening elevator sequence, the centerpiece with the bus, and finally a climactic (or post-climactic as some may see it) resolution which I won't divulge here. The bus sequence is easily the movie's highlight, quite possibly the longest action scene I've ever seen. The whole setpiece lasts just a little over fifty minutes and throws in every imaginably plausible hindrance there is to keeping a bus over 50 mph. <br />The stark simplicity of the premise is what fuels the film. There's probably no greater compliment I can pay the movie than to say that I can't imagine the premise being pulled off better. Every strand related to story and script is merely a means to keep the action and suspense going; I've rarely seen a film maintain such a high level of intensity and pure thrilling, crowdpleasing fun for such a lengthy period of time.<br />Director Jan de Bont's work here is probably among the best feature film debuts out there (only Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead comes to mind as an equally terrific debut, but was that even released in theaters in the U.S.?); he keeps the editing super-tight and the pacing frantic, but still puts the action together with crystal-clear comprehensibility. That's a fantastic accomplishment. Whatever happened to the de Bont who knew how to deliver such kinetic thrills? Each of his successive films have been progressively worse, and he's even gone as low as making a Tomb Raider sequel. Mr. de Bont, you're better than that.<br />The acting and dialogue are adequate enough that they don't distract from any of the action or thrills. Limited as his talent may be, Keanu Reeves is just one of those actors who I can't help but like. His performance here is still fraught with obvious moments of poor acting, but he's overall better than usual and occasionally even quite good, and he's a pretty damn easy hero to root for. <br />Sandra Bullock is perhaps the real standout of the picture. As feisty and sexy in a girl-next-door way as any heroine, Bullock is appealingly down to earth and entirely convincing as just a normal bystander caught in an unbelievable situation; this is as natural as acting gets. She also has damn good chemistry with Reeves, one of the vital elements missing in the sequel. Dennis Hopper is fine as the villain, this isn't really anything we haven't already seen from him in one form or another but his schtick was still amusing at the time. Cast directors must also be applauded for all (well, most of, a couple of the extras in the bus are pretty bad) the extras and character actors they used to play the bus passengers; there's a genuine sense of teamwork and solid chemistry at hand.<br />At no point does Speed ever crumble; its perfectly lean storytelling ensures that it never strays from the thrills on hand and it's so exciting only the biggest hard-hearted churl would try to nitpick the implausibilities. The last few minutes might seem a little excessive when one considers how exhausted we already are from all the non-stop action. That said, the third act is still very exciting, just not as inventive as the action that came before it.<br />Speed was inevitably followed by a sequel, which wasn't entirely unenjoyable in its own right, but misses a lot of the spark that's evident in this picture. Hell, I'd even say it needed Keanu Reeves, but by that magical Keanu rule of blockbuster hits, he wisely passed reprising the role of Traven and went on to star in The Matrix. Yup, I don't see his career extinguishing any time soon.
0811729117|3.0|Carius does a good job of conveying the tactical realities of tank warfare from the German side. He is very typical of those surviving Panzer writers, whose writing often resembles that of Civil War generals, particularly Confederate ones: \\"If only...\\", when the essential problem was that the initiation of the war in Europe by Germany, coupled by the declaration of war against the United States, meant that Germany was inevitably doomed. Tactical brilliance would eventually be overwhelmed by the massive production capability of the Allies. And even the tactical brilliance arguments wear thin when one realizes that much of the German success lay in the incredible inferiority of the equipment of the Western Allies (see \\"Death Traps\\" by Belton Cooper and the tragic example of the Sherman tank). Though Germany faced France with inferior equipment and invaded Russia with nothing on tracks that matched the T34, excellent tactical handling, especially the recognition of the antitank capability of the FLAK 88mm antiaircraft gun, and air supremacy, gave the Germans a temporary edge and time to accelerate the development of new armor, most notably the Panther and the Tiger. However much either tank was \\"over engineered\\" and needlessly difficult to maintain, the reality was nothing on the Western Front could stand up to them until the arrival of the M26 Pershing. Even so, they could not have won, something Carius finds difficult to truly comprehend. He disparages enemy soldiers, especially Americans, while failing to recognize that these amateurs at war, armed with often inferior equipment, nonetheless kept coming at him and Germany until by sheer weight of blood, steel, and ferocity, they destroyed the nation that twice in the 20th Century plunged Europe into war and visited a level of depravity upon the helpless not matched until Cambodia and Bosnia.
B000003T9B|5.0|I bought Taking Over first, back when that album first came out, but Feel the Fire is by far my favorite of their albums, and if I was ranking their albums, I would actually rank them in the order of release (for at least their first 4 albums).  Part of the appeal of this album is the over-the-top (almost comical) satanic lyrics that define the thrash scene of the mid-80s.  There are no weak tracks on this album, and the greatness is in the great choruses during many of the songs.  The only drawback is the weak mixing and mastering job, this is an album that improves greatly when the &quot;loudness&quot; button is used on the stereo to boost the bass.
078062999X|1.0|This movie royally sucked.  It's too effing long and I was bored of it and kenneth branagh is the worst actor I have evr seen in my life... this movie made me wanna kill myself and hamlet and shakespeare. Don't buy it, do me a favor and don't buy it.  This movie is royal trash at it's best.
B00005NWM3|5.0|As soon as I popped this CD in the player, I KNEW it was one band that sounded like nothing I have ever heard before. I am a HUGE music fan, I have over 700 CD's and this cd sounds nothing like anything I have in my collection. Strait ahead rock and roll with a great vocal sound. Chad and the boys are tight and very good at what they do. You guys that say they suck probably listen to Morbid Angel and Kind Diamond!!!!!! Get a life, and a new sence or talent while your at it. If you like kick ass, tight, driving, strong music, buy this CD, trust me.
B00006879E|5.0|As good as this album is, check out Kara's Flowers &quot;Fourth World&quot; if you can find it.  &quot;Soap Disco&quot; still ranks as one of my favorite 90s tunes.  Out of print, it's fetching at least $25 on ebay.  <br />Bonus:  Do a search here on amazon (Kara's Flowers) and read some comments by the band's guitarist.<br />Majorly talented band.
B000174LVQ|5.0|Paco's previous album LUZIA is all time favorite album of mine and is a beautiful communication of pain, loss, anguish and mortality. A masterpiece of flamenco new, old or however it's percieved. It's been about 5 or 6 years now since the release of Luzia, so what would be the result of Paco's next release? Luzia part two? Well, not really.<br />I didn't buy Cositas Buenas the first time I saw it in the store. I was concerned about the \\"neuvo flamenco\\" sticker on the packaging.  Curiousity was gnawing at me and I drove back to the store later that night to buy it. I'm very appreciative of Paco's works from his earliest recordings on, so I knew I'd have to hear it eventualy. While it's not quite the solo guitar showcase that many of his other albums are I find it to be nonetheless captivating and purposeful. On first few minutes of listening I thought to myself \\"awe, too bad, it's not the same strain and fervor as Luzia\\", but the more I listened the more it I understood and felt from it. I listened to it in it's entirety twice that night and a least a little bit everyday since then. <BR>Thankfully, it's free of the jazziness or modernisisms that the \\"Neuvo Flamenco\\" sticker would've led me to believe. While it's not quite gritty and raw enough to be tagged as Flamenco Puro it is unquestionably Flamenco(!) My only beef with this release is the overuse of studio compressors in the recording process. While this may result in a strong, punchy recording it also sadly restricts some of the openess and reduces the dynamic range. But this has to do with the production, not the performances themselves. <br />The music here communicates (to me) not quite tranquility, peace or joy but instead, acceptence that perhaps he (as all of us) is not getting any younger and there's no need to prove otherwise. <BR>Nearly any and all of Paco's past recordings seem to be a deep and painstaking process to create due to his artistic integrity. This album sounds much less strenuous and toiling then his albums of the past but still teems with all the integrity of an artist doing exactly what he wants.  <BR>The music is beautiful and positive without actualy sounding celebratory of festive. The guitar is a little softer in tone and in the mix compared to Paco's previous recordings, but I relate this to being a reflection of Paco's own relaxed mental and physical state... like a man and his art aging gracefuly with the aim of creating as he wishes at his own leisure/decision. The guitar playing is (still)absolutly world class just without the need-for-speed of a youngman with something to prove.  The vocals (and handclaps and percussion) result in a beautiful blend. <BR>Cositas Buenas is a gorgeous, fresh and new ablum from a master. It stands out as somewhat different in feel and form from anything he has released in the past. This is what we should expect and look forward to from an artist, is it not?<BR>Paco is perhaps a little more at ease and accepting in his life now and this recording translates that well. <br />Luzia:  a masterpiece of loss and sorrow.<br />Cositas Buenas: a masterpiece of acceptence and contentment.<br />With this new release, Cositas Buenas, Senor de Lucia has given us yet another aural viewpoint of the rich and infinite garden of Flamenco and beyond.
B000000OSG|2.0|I absolutely did not enjoy the Use Your Illusion II album by Guns N' Roses.  Except for the songs 'Civil War' and 'You Could Be Mine'. In my opinion, the album is just bad and somewhat silly.  Use Your Illusion I is clearly the better album of the two.  Don't get me wrong, I love Guns N' Roses, but Use Your Illusion II and The Sphagetti Incident, I think are GNR's worst albums. By the way, Geffen records has just released GNR's Greatest Hits album, inspight of Axl's objection. Anyway, the best songs from Use Your Illusion II are going to be on this greatist hits album.  So don't even bother getting Use Your Illusion II.
1891252089|5.0|A thoughtful organization and presentation of Ashtanga Yoga. The focus of the book is the postures and, to a lesser extent, bandhas. You can get a feel for the author's experience by his detailed instructions and observations, including 'Drishthi' or the point of internal focus to be maintained while performing an asana. Of course, the picture-perfect photographs the author himself is in, stands as an example of his dedication to the practice. Hats off to a true yoga teacher for presenting the book keeping the practitioner-student in mind. For a long time, I struggled with having to keep a Yoga book open while reading and practicing from it! <br />Aptly and humbly, the author starts with illustrating who a Yogi (or more precisely how a Yogi looks) is by referring to people in and around his life, like his teacher - K. Pattabhi Jois of Mysore, India - and parents, who achieved Yoga through service. One doesn't become a Yogi by perfecting one's physical body. <BR>The presentation and discussion is very traditional. Sanskrit names are used to refer to the postures, but you will find the translation alongside. Apart from the asanas, a brief discussion of the other 8 limbs of Ashtanga yoga is presented. <br />A true practice manual as intended. The layout of the photographs for the different series - primary, intermediate, et al help one to briefly glance and continue practice. The author has taken liberty, as he explains, in presenting a shorter series of asanas for the time-contstrained. Props don't play a big role in the practice. If you are familiar with Yoga and wish to stay inspired about your practice, this book will help you very much. Just don't try to practice in all those risky places the Author has pictured himself in!
B00008WG3U|5.0|War on Errorism is truly an excellent album. &quot;Seperation of church &amp; skate&quot; and &quot;Franco Un-american&quot; were my favorite songs. Nofx's albums never get boring!!
B0000AQVCL|3.0|Falls into the catagory of the White Stripes, The Strokes ect. except with a little more edge. The Album as a whole, doesn't quite have enough additude for my taste, but Cold Hard B**** is a very good song.  Too bad they didn't follow its lead with the rest of the album.  <br />From a objective viewpoint, this is a very good album for those into the sound.
B000000OSE|3.0|In my opinion, I strongly think that Use Your Illusion I album is much better than the Use Your Illusion II album.  The compilation of these two albums that Geffen released, titled Use Your Illusion, has quite a few good songs missing. The Use Your Illusion I album does have many filler songs on it that are just simply terrible, but there are quite a few great songs on it that make it a pretty good damn album.
0790734850|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe play two officers who are used to L.A.'s corrupt police force and even take advantage of the system.  It is both the noble, moralistic attitude of a rookie (Guy Pearce) and the death of a fellow cop that make them remember why they joined the force in the first place.  A great noir film filled with dry wit and superb acting by Crowe, Spacey and Pearce.  Unfortunately, it was never properly publicized or awarded on account of the showboat arrival of the overhyped epic \\"Titanic.\\"  Please give this film its due acknowledgment!
B000002UB6|4.0|After a ton of media frenzy, the much - heralded &quot;Let It Be&quot; was finally released in 1970. For their final album, many fans were hoping that their idols would leave them with someting to remember them by. Well, they did. The problem is, it's remembered as a pretty weak effort, to say the least.<br />Not that &quot;Let It Be&quot; is bad. It's very good, but flawed. Gone from this album is the crisp production of George Martin, whose original recordings saturated with the fat of Phil Spector's orchestral arrangements, which drags down even the most enduring songs &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot;. The only songs safe from the Spector touch are &quot;One After 909&quot; (originally written in 1962), &quot;Get Back&quot;,&quot;From Me To You, &quot;Dig It&quot;, the fragment &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;. Great songs like &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, &quot;Across The Universe&quot; and &quot;Two Of Us&quot; have been drenched sugary pablum thanks to Spector. You also have to remeber that &quot;Let It Be&quot; was not the last Beatles album made. &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was, but it got released before &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Plus, Ringo Starr does not get any coverage whatsoever as far as vocals go. He and George don't even play on &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot;.<br />&quot;Let It Be&quot; is probably the most debatable Beatles album ever. Many people think it's great, and others hate it. I think it's just good.
B00002E233|4.0|Renny Harlin, the director has really out done himself on this movie production.  Thomas Jane staring as Carter Blake is a control guard on this gigantic version of `Alcatraz' but set in the middle of the ocean. Saffron Burrows, Dr. Susan McCallister has been assigned to enlarge 3 Great White sharks' brains to make their brain capacity much larger.  This all goes shockingly wrong when the sharks start to think for themselves.  The sharks can't break down the fence because it is made out of re-enforced titanium.<BR>The acting is was truly magnificent because if you understand the movie then you start to care for the actors. I thought the best actor was Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), his expression was dead on time to make the movie feel like it was a real event happening at that exact second.<BR>This film is a very good but if you liked the movie `Jaws' then you will like this even more.
B000005JA8|1.0|I think that my ears are ruined from listening to this terrible noise.
6302787300|2.0|Okay, kids, let's forget all about the \\"Columbus was a bad dead white male\\" business and get to the real reason why this film had \\"lackluster\\" performance at the box office.<br />\\"1492\\" is loaded with gratuitous and gruesome violence.  It was clear from the first reviewers a decade ago that the images of burning at the stake, garotting, the beheaded sailor with the harelip, and the guy leaping to his death and having his bones poke through the skin (what's up with that?) were not easy to forget.  What was easy to forget was the rest of the movie, because much of it is boring (oh, almost neglected to mention the Spaniard with the bloody urine...sorry).  Forget about the use of Spanish in the film, most of it is in \\"furry English\\", courtesy of Depardieu and his Euro cinema pals.<br />Cool, 15th century adventure stories are not well served by hangups with \\"a more brutal time\\", or politically correct references to the Carib indians or \\"the Moors\\".  If you want to have them in furry English, you may as well have them speak Spanish and Italian (and Carib?) and just use subtitles.<br />Better luck with the movie version on the 600th anniversary of the Columbus voyage?  Don't hold your breath.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Like most people growing up in the 1960s', The Beatles changed my entire life. Songs like &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, right on up to &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot;, they changed my whole view of music and life. So imagine my joy when this album came out. And despite the fact that a few key tracks like &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; (perhaps the most striking ommision) and &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;, one could hardly deny that this cd delivers what it promises.<br />The first half is from 1962 - 1966. Some people are so fixated on their later &quot;experimental&quot; period, that they often overlook the fact they also created incredible 3 - minute pop songs like &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;From Me To You&quot;. But, the second half (1967 - 1970) is still their best period. One could hardly deny that Something&quot;, &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;, and the immortal &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, among others, are some of the greatest songs ever written. Even humorus numbers like &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; and the grossly underrated &quot;The Ballad Of John And Yoko&quot; have frequent sheds of brilliant thanks their rather abstract lyrics.<br />&quot;Beatles 1&quot; is really a classic album. Every song here stays true the concept of the album, and started a tremd of &quot;greatest hits&quot; albums followed by Elvis Presley, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, The Beach Boys, The Eagles, and The Supremes. But The Beatles will always be number one.
B000005JA8|1.0|Uggh.  Come, now - surely they can't expect us to think that they MEANT for it to turn out this way.  Beefheart was a notorious prankster, but an exceptionally untalented musician.  There isn't a single song here that couldn't have been written in 25 seconds of tootling.  Beefheart plays two saxophones at once on some of these songs.  Mate, that's just nonsense.  A colossal joke on everyone who believes in music.
6305313687|5.0|This is an amazing movie from many views.  Most people who i have spoken to have said that this movie was nothing but a bunch of \\"Skin Heads\\" Rippin on Blacks and Jews.  I Belive this movie caught my attention for the simple fact it made you racist.  This movie was so empowering That it took you and turns against everything you have ever been taught indifrence.  The views in this movie were to strong and too supported that it makes you have to turn in to that.  I know being only 16 that many parents censor movies to there children and that if the parent is offended typically the never even attempt to watch it again, Well this movie offended them immensly yet they still watched the whole thing.  Many Whites dont want to admit to there racism because society rejects it but watching this movie can almost change your view. I guarentee that you will be moved by this movie...
0684801558|4.0|The Beautiful and Damned, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a tragic tale of a man named Anthony, struggling with several issues.  It begins with his own laziness and social anxiety, only to continue with an effort to achieve the love of a beautiful, yet seemingly unattainable, woman.  War, alcohol and other women also play a large role in the struggles Anthony encounters throughout the novel.  Ultimately, this book portrays the life of a man whose lackadaisical attitude about life, eventually leads to his own downfall and inevitable insanity.<BR>Fitzgerald wrote this piece in order to analyze the time in which it was written.  Throughout the entire novel, there is a specific reference to prohibition and how alcohol was used not only for pleasure, but also as an escape.  Throughout the story, as Anthony's life becomes more troubling and hard for him to handle, the reader is able to see he resorts to alcohol more and more and it eventually ends up consuming his life.  His addiction and lack of purpose in life eventually leads to his downfall.  By the end, Anthony is unable to go one day, let alone a few hours, with out getting drunk and spends the little money he and his wife have to obtain more alcohol.  This drunken scene only continues to grow worse after he enters the war scene.<BR>Another significant event perceived by the author through this piece is the war.  Fitzgerald was in the army, following his senior year at Princeton, and due to this, many of the details of the war in the novel may have been significant memories to Fitzgerald in which he wished to reveal to those who were uninformed. The war played a large role in this novel as a whole.  While things were growing dull in Anthony and Gloria's marriage, issues in the world were elevating.  When Anthony goes to enlist, their marriage is given time to breathe and recuperate while they are apart.  Yet, Anthony's faithfulness is questioned once he has been away from Gloria for a while and he begins to forget his life back at home.  While providing an escape for Anthony and Gloria's' marriage, the war changed their relationship.  It seemed to be a turning point at first with Anthony's return, yet after the first week they were reunited, the couple was once again back to their fighting, drinking and partying away what little patience and money they still obtained.<BR>Much like Anthony's character in the book, Fitzgerald's involvement in the war efforts had a large impact on his life.  This greatly influenced the details of the war and Anthony's romantic love affair in the novel.  While Fitzgerald was at one of his army posts, he met a girl named Zelda Sayre, who may have been represented by Dorothy's character in the novel.  Yet in the novel, Anthony's affair with Dot was what eventually ate away at his pride and confidence.  He had worked so long and hard to achieve Gloria's companionship.  He had fought so hard to obtain what he thought to be unattainable, a beautiful, young, and full of life, woman.  Yet, in the end, he allowed this relationship to disintegrate, and found himself in the arms of another.  His guilt eventually became so great that he was unable to deal with it.  This guilt lead him to eventually push away all of Dots' affections and do the only thing he knew how to do, drink her out of his memory.  In the end, when Dot reappeared at his apartment door, begging for his love, no matter what the circumstance, Anthony's guilt, insanity and drunken state gave way to his need for her extinction.  Following this instance, Anthony had nothing left to look forward to, and retreated into his mind, to a place in his childhood where he found comfort.  There he stayed, no longer caring whether or not his grandfather's money was obtained or anything else, except his small stamp collection, living content only through his memories of the past.<br />Another conflict of society at this time in which Fitzgerald attempted to portray was the carelessness of the upper class and their inevitable downfall.  The Patch couple is a prime example of such social standings.  Both came from relatively well off  families, yet instead of taking responsibility for their lives and their future life together, they depended solely on the possibility of wealth from Adam's grandfather throughout their entire marriage.  In any attempt to find a job to support themselves, they were easily distracted.  Although eventually they won the lawsuit and the money Anthony's grandfather had unintentionally left, by this time it was pointless.  It took five years to gain the money they had been waiting for, for so long.  Ironically, it was not until Anthony had given up both physically and psychologically, that the money was obtained.  This symbolized how hard and long someone can work for something, eventually driving themselves to insanity before the goal is reached and once it's actually achieved, one is too exhausted both physically and mentally to care anymore.<BR>In this novel, the author accurately portrayed life during this time, and showed his feelings on issues such as war, love, money, social standing and sanity.  The author's indication of how these issues correspond with and affect each other as well as the outcome of the combination of such issues is revealed through this novel.  This allows the reader to get an accurate sense of life during this time, both of the prosperous and those who struggled.  The war had a great affect on the sanity, monetary situation, and relationships of many men at this time allowing for the creation of such characters as in The Beautiful and Damned.   Yet Fitzgerald took it one-step further and created a dramatic and eventually tragic love story that grips the reader until the last line of the story with Anthony saying, \\"I showed them...It was a hard fight, but I didn't give up and I came through!\\" (449).
B000002UAC|5.0|Though they did release one album before this, this was the first album The Fab Four released in America, and what a debut. While not as groundbreaking or influential as later albums like &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; or &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, it is still a great album, with a very cool (not to mention often  - parodied) album cover.<br />&quot;With The Beatles&quot; begins on fire with &quot;It Won't Be Long&quot;, before things slow down a bit with the sweet &quot;All I've Got To Do&quot;. Things pick up with &quot;All My Loving&quot;, a sparse, acoustic guitar - driven rocker that also was one of their early hits. &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; features a good George vocal, followed by the raucous &quot;Little Child&quot;, followed by their classic cover of &quot;Til There Was You&quot;, then a stupendous cover of &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;, the first Motown number one in 1961. &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; is a great cover of the Chuck Berry classic, and &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; is a sweet little ditty. &quot;You've Really Got A Hold On Me&quot; is another great Motown cover, while &quot;Devil In The Heart&quot; is a nice cha - cha. &quot;Not A Second Time&quot; and a cover of &quot;Money&quot; close the album.<br />&quot;With The Beatles&quot; is the album that gave birth to a phenomenon that is still alive 40 years later. I hope everyone will soon be a Beatles fan and make the world a better place to live in.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Yes, like many people have admitted in their reviews, I too mistook Shakira as a Britney wannabe at first.  But &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; was just catchy enough that I eventually was compelled to give her a chance.  And am I glad I did, because Laundry Service is a fantastic pop album.  First off, Shakira has a great voice, powerful and emotive.  And unlike most teen idols, Shakira made this her album, writing and producing it in its entirety.  And she shows her talents extend beyond her amazing vocal ability, crafting some great, energetic music you can't sit still through, like &quot;Whenever, Wherever,&quot; &quot;Te Dejo Madrid,&quot; and &quot;Objection (Tango),&quot; both of which are here in English and Spanish verisons.  She also shows herself just as talented crafting ballads like &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; and &quot;The One.&quot;  Even the tracks that didn't quite work for me are still interesting; I might not really like &quot;Eyes Like Yours,&quot; but I still respect her for blending Persian influences into Rock and Roll so seamlessly.  This is a great album, and I look forward to exploring the rest of Shakira's catalog.
0694524441|3.0|The main character, named Santiago, goes on a journey where he discovers how to be one with the world.  He finds his purpose in life, with the help of an old man, and he follows through with his course of action, no matter what happens.  The only problem I had with this book was its applicability.  I liked the story, and I think Coelho makes a good point to look out for signs in life.  But as far as how I felt after I finished the book, I was wishing that I had not read it.  I am easily inspired, and this book can be inspiring.  But to do what?  Drop everything in your life to pursue your dreams?  That is what I would like to do, but I have a common problem that is called obligations.  The book made me feel like if I didn't drop everything and do something now, I would be eternally unhappy.  However, if you are not easily inspired, the story will leave you with happy memories.  I recommend it.
B000002UAR|5.0|After &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; broke the envelope as far as rock music creativity goes, &quot;Revolver&quot; continued the string of classic albums that The Beatles scored. It was also a great precursor to the next album. Maybe you've heard of it, it's called &quot;Sergaent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. You did? I thought so.<br />&quot;Revolver&quot; begins with the witty &quot;Taxman&quot;, an acid - tinged George Harrison composition. Next comes a Beatles classic, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, which still sounds as fresh and original as it did 38 years ago, from the first chord to the last note. &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; is an odd track about (you guessed it) sleeping. &quot;Love You To&quot; is George's envoy into physcadellia, and &quot;Here, There And Everywhere&quot; is a finely crafted Paul ballad. &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; is another classic. Feturing innovative sound effects and arguably Ringo's best lead vocal, it should've been number one. It remained lodged at number two, unable to unseat &quot;You Can't Hurry Love&quot; by The Supremes. &quot;She Said, She Said&quot; is another witty number, while &quot;Good Day, Sunshine&quot; is a bright and cheery pop song. &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; is a nice rocker, and the scalding ache of &quot;For No One&quot; is just electrifying. &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; is okay to say the least. &quot;I Want To Tell You&quot; is a trippy George Harrison composition. &quot;Go To Get You Into My Life&quot; is a classic, and it became a top ten hit when Earth, Wind And Fire took it to number nine. Closing the album is John's mystifying &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, a great track.<br />&quot;Revolver&quot; is one of The Beatles' best album.
0156013983|5.0|I have read TPP in Spanish, as a child; in English and now in French. The French is 100 times better than any translation. If you have been raised in a romance language, you know that the charm and sonority of French or Spanish is completely lost, even in a good translation. If you have read TPP in translation before, read it in French. It is easy to understand and a great book for those, like me, who want to develop reading skills.<br />Regarding the story, it is indisputable that TPP is a classic full of wisdom.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I went to see this movie for 4 times. It's such a great fantasy movie I have ever seen before. Casting and custuming are excellent and screen-playing is so smooth. And the kids,Jeremy, his friends and the girl are so cute. Don't ever miss this great phenomenon!

0930289234|5.0|Why does Amazon release graphic novels late?  Comic shops get them on time.  Retail outlets like Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble get them 1-2 weeks after the shops.  Is this because some book merchants mistakenly still look down on comics?<br />Get your act together Amazon!  People who read graphic novels deserve the same respect as people who read mainstream novels, which ship on time I might add!<br />If you're reading this and you want to get your graphic novels shipped on time and not one month late then tell Amazon so!  If enough people demand it their distributors will comply!
B00004WLXZ|3.0|Do we really need a special edition of this film that glorifies fascism and hate?  Perhaps for the neo-nazi we do, but certainly the general public doesn't need this, the original edition is the same and will do.  Its upsetting to see how much people spend to revive things like this, almost as if they dream that the 1000 Year reich will return.  A chilling film, very real, a document of the nazi years.<br />Seth J. Frantzman
B00000J7SS|5.0|For whatever reasons that compelled Miles Davis to create this album, and there are many reviewers quite happy to elaborate on events that were documented and rumoured to have taken place around the creation of this; it is one hell of an electrically charged set of jams. Funky, wild, dark, mysterious, it is not easy listening, thank god. It is a powerful cathartic masterpiece. And these remasters are so much clearer, the difference is striking. <BR>Yes, I was not captivated on my first listen, like many of my favourite albums, it took awhile for it's secrets to reveal themselves. Certainly not for everyone. <BR>If I might romanticise a little, it is like praying to a storm, 'give me your worst', then being swept up in the arms of the storm and carried effortlessly into the magic and sometimes violent energy of natures forces.<BR>Well, anyway thanks to whoever did the remaster, nice work.
630469797X|5.0|Dawn of the Dead (George Romero, 1979)<br />I can't believe I haven't already written a review of this, given the number of times I've seen it. But I watched it again last night since the remake is coming out soon, so...<br />Dawn of the Dead begins an unspecified time after the closing of Night of the Living Dead. The zombies have reached at least as far east as Philadelphia, where two workers at a TV station decide to steal the weather chopper and head for Canada. They're taking a friend along with them, who brings another guy. The four of them are the core of the movie, aborting the Canada idea when they run out of fuel, stopping on the outskirts of Pittsburgh to take up residence in a shopping mall.<br />There are simply not enough good things to be said about this movie. While it didn't completely redefine the genre the way Night of the Living Dead did, Romero pushed the American envelope (as he is so fond of doing), incorporating giallo-style violence that Americans were completely unfamiliar with at the time while all the while pursuing the same sociopolitical commentary that makes Night of the Living Dead so rewatchable even thirty-five years later. Romero is a master at getting his point across without being too preachy about it; ninety-nine percent of the movie's hundred twenty-eight minutes (in the American version) keeps the commentary below the radar (all save one brief scene that's a little on the heavy-handed side).<br />For an ultra-low-budget flick, the acting is tremendous. All four main characters do their jobs capably, and they're surrounded with a supporting cast whose lack of acting resumes since is criminal. Special note should be given to Richard France, a member of the Romero \\"inner circle\\" since There's Always Vanilla, as an overly pragmatic television commentator who's just a joy to watch every time he comes onscreen.<br />The pacing is excellent, the effects not completely overdone (though, honestly, they did get better in Day of the Dead), the mix of humor and disgust perfect. There is very little to be said wrong about this brilliant movie. Don't expect to be scared, but expect to enjoy yourself tremendously. **** ½), the mix of humor and disgust perfect. There is very little to be said wrong about this brilliant movie. Don't expect to be scared, but expect to enjoy yourself tremendously. **** ½
B000002KHB|5.0|As a devoted listener of Classic Rock, Deep Purple is one of my favourite bands. I have not listened everything recorded by them but I have listened to great albums like &quot;In Rock&quot;, &quot;Fireball&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, and &quot;Machine Head&quot;. I have also listened to their latest offering &quot;Bananas&quot; which cannot be categorized as great but still a very good effort. &quot;Machine Head&quot; gets my vote as the best among the lot with some competition from &quot;Fireball&quot; and &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. Everybody knows that &quot;Machine Head&quot; has &quot;Highway Star&quot;, &quot;Smoke On The Water&quot; and &quot;Space Tracking&quot;. The first two are celebrated for Blackmore's riffing and the third one has one of the most ferocious drumming put into record (courtsey Ian Paice). The other tracks are almost equally good as the known three. Noteably &quot;Never Again&quot; was band's choice for first single from the album. <br />The album is very consistent, energetic and fun. Any Hard Rock Lover should already own this masterpiece. In case you do not have it get it as soon as possible. Tell me if you are able to listen it without shaking your head or without air-drumming or air-guitarring. The sound quality makes it more worthwhile. A classic.

B00003CWL6|5.0|This deserved Best Picture in my oppinion.This was one of the greatest films i've ever seen.It's funny,heartbreaking,controversial,and perverted,yet it somehow along the way makes you love it.Kevin Spacey,Anette Bening,<BR>Chris Cooper,Mena Suvari,Thora Birch,and Wes Bentley were all great in this film about love and loss.Spacey plays Lester Burnham,a man who hates his life.His job,his marriage,everything.<BR>But one day while watching his daughter Jane (Birch) at cheerleading he sees a girl Angela (Suvari) dancing and falls in love with the young girl and finally decides to take charge of his stupid pitiful little life.Bening plays his wife Carol,who also hates her marriage and begins to take charge.Another sub plot is the next door neighbors Colonel Frank Fitts (Cooper),<BR>his wife (Allison Janey),and his camera happy son (Bentley) who falls in love with Jane.This movie was awesome,flat out incredible.It has some of the funniest lines in movie history including:<br />CAROL:Whose car is that out front?<br />LESTER:Mine.1970 Pontiac Firebird,the car i've always wanted,and now I have it.I rule.<br />A for the movie.Enjoy!!!
B00018D3RI|5.0|As someone who was ten when &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; premiered in September of '75, I was very excited to get my hands on this brand new DVD first season set in honor of one of my favorite shows of the 70's. (The other being &quot;Emergency!&quot;). Looking at these episodes so crisply re-mastered, brings back a lot of memories of sighing longingly while gazing at Paul Michael Glaser (&quot;Starsky&quot;)..as my older sister pined for the dreamy David Soul (&quot;Hutch&quot;). I remember the excitement as a young child of waiting for &quot;my&quot; show to come on every Wednesday evening and discovering what &quot;messes&quot; my heroes were going to get into. Even back then, I appreciated the humor, loyal friendship and camaraderie of the two leads; two men who were never afraid to show or express their deep love and affection for each other. It is that element that has kept me a fan to this day.<br />As always, my favorite episodes involved angst or &quot;hurt/comfort&quot;..and I eagerly awaited fan favorites such as, &quot;The Fix&quot;, &quot;The Shootout&quot;, and &quot;A Coffin for Starsky&quot;; anything that expressed the heartfelt devotion and concern these two men had for each other. I know that in today's age, such overt displays of affection would be frowned upon amongst men..and certainly back then it was unique, unusual and different..but it is this very uniquely displayed vulnerability and CHEMISTRY amongst the gritty reality of their daily lives that made the show a winner for me, and still makes it so to this day. There has been, nor will there EVER be, a cop show to match the heart that this show had: two undercover cops whose priority to their jobs was surpassed only by their deep love and affection for each other. Their motto: &quot;Me and Thee&quot; sums up in a nutshell what this series was all about-friendship first. It warms my heart, also, to know that both Paul and David were and still are just as close offscreen. It makes watchingthese episodes all the more touching.<br />A VERY BIG thank you to Amazon for sending out my replacement DVD's within a two-day period. You guys ROCK!!!
B00005JLXE|3.0|there are a lot worse ways to spend a few hours than watching daredevil. fine cast, cool characters, memorable moments, good dvd extras, and great soundtrack. not quite up there with other recent comic movies since daredevil is an odd hero and comic, but a cool way to spend time in front of the t.v. from time to time.
630428540X|5.0|Normally I am the type that would ignore a film with John Travolta and Kyra Sedgewick;  I would assume it was too mainstream, not original, etc.  I'm not sure how then I did come to see this film, but I must say I am glad I did.<br />This is a gem of a movie, about life, death, regret, etc.  It is just so poignant.  I've now seen the film a few times, and every time, I get a lump in my throat at the end.  (I especially also liked the &quot;apple scene&quot;!)  The music really works in this film as well.
B00005JN1L|2.0|Fine, and somewhat scary film that has a another good performance from Johnny Depp but is very predicable in certain scenes, and the ending is much to be deserved. If you see it, see it for Depp's performance but I suggest you wait for video instead.
B0000024TT|5.0|I listened to Leonard Cohen when I was in my teens and early twenties.  I loved Suzanne, Bird on the Wire and other Cohen songs with some level of appreciation.  Thirty years later, after hearing In My Secret Life on The L Word on Showtime, I was drawn back to Leonard Cohen.  I bought this cd and found on it songs that have weathered better than I have.  After sailing life's seas, I found them like a lot more wise and rich than I did earlier.  Listening to this compilation is like biting into a great deli sandwich piled high with rich tasty ingredients--a feast for the mind and heart, worthy of playing over and over again long after the sandwich wrapping is gone.
B00000IL26|5.0|This a desert island jazz disc. Any true jazz fan either has or had this disc in their collection and with good reason. The title track is the seminal jazz formula rooted in hard bop that was progressing into the formation of a free wheeling post bop generation of new players to carry on  the torch. The brilliant then young, now long gone trumpeter Lee Morgan assembled a tight group of musicians to record his original compositons. This disc demonstrates the talent Lee Morgan had as a composer and soloist, unfortunately his time amongst us was short. The cast of musicians was outstanding with extra props going out to bassist Bob Cranshaw and veteran tenor sax man Joe Henderson. The rhythmic and harmonic structure of these songs played on this session are exceptional examples of a cohesive jazz unit playing as one whole. The duet by Henderson and Morgan is a rare beautiful interchange by a lead and sideman on &quot;Totem Pole&quot; as each plays in harmony, in unison as one instrument then suddenly gives way for the other to add a solo within the framework and continuing the pattern hitting all registrars and shattering perception of what notes can do. Certain discs that have been resurrected from the archives sound better with a sonic cleansing and this is one of those. The music is hot jazz played with a cool demeanor, it is simply one of the best  in it's genre. It is about as tight a recording session as you'll ever hear. Originally recorded in the sixties this disc is the perfect backdrop as you  make your way through a  day in the concrete urban jungle. This is music to put your top down and cruise with the wind blowing through your hair as you leave the golden triangle and head up  the coast to your hideaway.  If you don't have this in your collection check it out and file it under perenially hip and classic right next to Miles Davis. Highly recommended for straight-ahead jazz aficionados.

0784011176|2.0|I just got my copy from Amazon and what a disappointment. The Piano is one of my favorite films and living in Quebec I had a hard time finding the widescreen version of the film. Imagine my joy to find it, finally, here on Amazon. However, having got it, and looked at it, I realize that the picture is a scan from one of the theatrical copies - it is full of dust (black specks that appear all over the image. In a day and age where even the cheapest DVD's are cleaned in post-production it is an outrage to see such a beautiful film with dust all over it. I wish they'd do another transfer from the original negative. Furthermore the widescreen - although considered wide is actually a 3:4 image letterboxed - it is not a real 16:9 widescreen transfer - meaning that you will have a lot fewer lines of image than you would have if it had been transferred anamorphic - For DVD lovers this is really a disappointment - and only 2.0 surround. If you love the film enough to live with these disappointments - I actually do - get the film. If you prefer pristine images and great sound - you'll be disappointed.
0064407667|5.0|Title: The Bad Beginning<BR>By: Lemony Snicket<BR>Reviewed by: B. Arihara<BR>Period: P.1<br />     The Baudelaire children Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are all wondering the beach when they receive terrible news that their parents have died in a fire which began in their house. Mr. Poe, the person to give them the news took care of the children until they were taken to their new father, Count Olaf. Count Olaf is a horrible evil man who is just interested in trying to get the Baudelaire fortune. He thinks of a scheme to receive the money, which can only be used by Violet when she is old enough to inherit it. Klaus eventually figures out Count Olaf's plan and tries to stop him, but instead gets them into more trouble. Olaf is going to have a play where he is the groom and Violet is the Bride. Justice Strauss, a neighbor who happens to be a judge, is the one who performed the wedding ceremony.  Once they both say their \\"I do's\\" and sign a piece of paper in front of a real judge, they will be officially married, which everyone thinks is just part of the play. Once they are married, Count Olaf will be able to take the Baudelaire money and dispose of the children. Unfortunately, everything has gone as planned and Violet and Count Olaf officially married as Olaf had thought. When Violet signed the piece of paper, she signed it with her left hand when she was right-handed, which means the document is invalid and they are not married. Justice Struaff arrested Count Olaf along with his assistants, and the Baudelaire children were taken away after saying their good-byes and thank-you's.<br />     One of the reasons why I liked this book was because the author explained, as he went along, the difficult words to understand. He saved some time for me by telling me what the words mean, so i don't have to take time and look them up in the dictionary. \\"The word nuptial means relating to marriage\\" is an example of his unique type of writing and so is \\"The word standoffish here means reluctant to associate with others.\\" Also i like how Sunny always says those baby words like \\"yeeka\\" or \\"odo yow.\\"<br />     I disliked this book because there was constantly bad things happening again and again. One after another terrible things happened to the Baudelaire children. They always got into trouble and when they thought of a plan, it was always ruined by Count Olaf or his assistants. Sometimes too many unpleasant happenings make a book not very enjoyable to read. There should be a little more happiness throughout the book.<BR>     <br />     My favorite part of the book is in the very beginning when Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are walking along the beach shore. The way the author described it made me remember all the fun times I had at the beach. I remember running in the shallow water looking for sea-shells and playing in the water trying to catch small fish with my hands or a net. The beach is probably my favorite place to go in the world. Whenever i think of the beach i think of happiness, joy, fun, and good times.

0452282152|5.0|Set in the mid sixteen hundreds in Delft Holland, Girl With a Pearl Earring is an excellent novel for any reader.  This book was a New York Times Bestseller, and also the winner of the Barnes and Noble Discover Great New Authors Award.  The author, Tracy Chevalier, does a wonderful job telling the story of Griet, a young girl growing up in Delft as a maid for the well to do family of a famous painter.<BR>     Griet's family comes upon financial hardship after her father has an accident, and is no longer able to work.  She is forced to go to work at the young age of sixteen.  Griet goes to live with Vermeer, a well know painter and his wealthy family to work as their maid.   Griet does not have it easy at the Vermeer house, and she is forced to work long and hard days.  She also has to contend with problems of the Vermeer's many children.  Fascinated by her master's paintings, she develops a strange relationship with the painter.  Eventually she becomes his assistant, helping him with his work.  Vermeer grows fond of the girl and values her opinion about his paintings, this makes things difficult for Griet with the painter's wife and the rest of the women in the household.  Griet not only has to contend with Vermeer's jealous wife, mischievous children, and powerful mother-in-law, but also his wealthy male friends and their unwanted advances.  Griet is torn between her love and fascination for the painter and his work, and the butcher's son Peter who tries to win her hand in marriage.  Griet knows that Peter's family business would be very beneficial to her impoverished family.  Girl With A Pearl Earring is a captivating story of love, art, the importance of family, and the changes that young Griet goes through as she becomes a young woman.<BR>     After finishing Girl With A Pearl Earring, I felt as if I knew Griet, Vermeer, and the other characters in the novel.  Chevalier's character development is exceptional.  She makes it possible for the reader to relate to each one of the characters on a different level and for different reasons.  Whether you liked a character in the novel, or not, Chevalier made it possible for the reader to understand why they behaved as they did.  As a reader you could sympathize with each character, and relate to them. <BR>     Another aspect of this novel which made it interesting was all the different themes that the novel represented.  The author had a focus on love, religion, deceit, money, social status, family, and art.  This made the novel very interesting.<BR>     Girl With A Pearl Earring was based on the life of Vermeer, who was a real Dutch painter in the sixteen hundreds.  This story was based on him, and the events of his life.  The Girl With the Pearl Earring was an actual famous painting of Vermeer's.  Tale has it that he was inspired by one of his maids, such as Griet, to paint the portrait.   Chevalier told the story simply and clearly making it very interesting and easy to follow.<BR>     The Author of Girl With A Pearl Earring, Tracy Chevalier, was born in Washington D.C., and she holds a graduate degree in creative writing from the University of East Anglia.  Chevalier currently resides in London with her son and husband.<BR>     I would definitely recommend Girl With A Pearl Earring to anyone.  I am sure you will find it a interesting, intriguing, and a somewhat  sad at times,  tale of life, love, family, social status, deceit, and art.  Chevalier leaves the reader with an expectation of things to come throughout the novel, which makes it difficult to put this book down.  The reader will fall in love with Griet and everything she goes through as a young maid.  Tracy Chevalier is a new author who made a place for herself as an author I would definately recommend.
B0000032LS|5.0|I first saw RHPS on December 12, 2002 when I bought it on VHS.  I've been a huge fan since then.  Not too long after, I bought the soundtrack, which I never seem to stop listening to.<br />Science Fiction/Double Feature-5 out of 5-A wonderful opening song.  It seems to tell you right away what this movie is: a spoof on all of the past Science Fiction movies.  Richard O'Brien is great singing this one. ;)<br />Dammit, Janet-5 out of 5-Great singing by Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon(B.B. and S.S. =P).<br />Over at the Frankenstein Place-5 out of 5-Great song.  I really love singing back-up and Riff-Raff's verse in this song.<br />Time Warp-5 out of 5-I love Patricia Quinn as Magenta.  I always sing her parts in this song.  Also, the dance is so much fun to do.<br />Sweet Transvestite-5 out of 5-Noone could ever pull off the role of Frank N. Furter like Tim Curry.  Tim has the look and the voice.<br />I Can Make You A Man-5 out of 5-Great song.  Tim really sounds great here.<br />Hot Patootie, Bless My Soul-5 out of 5-One of my favorites from this album.  Meatloaf, I believe was the best choice as Eddie.<br />I Can Make You A Man(reprise)-Great finish.  I really like Mendelssohn's wedding march re-done with a rock sound.<br />Touch-a Touch-a Touch Me-5 out of 5-Susan Sarandon is great as Janet.  This is a great song.<br />Eddie-5 out of 5-Jonathan Adams is great as Dr. Everett von Scott.  This is a great 60's style rock song.  Very fun to dance around and sing to.<br />The Floor Show-100 out of 5-The best song on the album!  My favorite part to it is &quot;Wild and Untamed Thing&quot;.<br />I'm Going Home-5 out of 5-The saddest song on the album.  I always get sad during this song in the movie because I know Frank's murder is coming up.  =(<br />Super Heroes-5 out of 5-It's sad because what Brad and Janet were singing about, summed up, is that they had a taste of a seedy life and it was abruptly taken away from them and they feel the repercussions of their actions.<br />Science Fiction/Double Feature-5 out of 5-A re-telling of the movie, in song form! =D<br />This movie isn't for everyone.  You'd have to have a very open mind to be able to sit through it.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Sure, the cute little Disney version of Peter Pan is nice, but as far as sticking close to the wonderfully written original story, Disney's Peter Pan is terrible! This Peter Pan, starring Jason Issacs and Jeremy Sumpter, is the only Peter Pan movie I have seen that really sticks close to the book. Sure, there are some parts that are different and some that are left out, but as far as sticking to litarature, this movie comes pretty close. Not to mention, its great! The special effects are awesome and It's a great movie to watch with any one! I highly recommentd it
B000066AXE|5.0|This film is one of the best I have seen. John Nash (Russel Crowe) is the main character, who is odd, yet you want to figure out who he is and what he's like. That draws you into the movie. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but let me tell you something. Most movies that are &quot;sad&quot; usually don't do anything to me to make me believe that they are indeed sad. This movie is one of the select few that reach the top of my charts. In fact, I can only think of five that make it to my standards: Saving Private Ryan, Gods and Generals, Road To Perdition, John Q, and now A Beautiful Mind. It really got me saddened when I learned that these cool people that I and John had known throughout the movie were not real. Wouldn't that suck if the coolest, nicest people you knew weren't real? The only problem like these kind of movies is that the shock factor isn't there after the first time you watch it. You get used to the storyline and know what to expect. However, the first time you see a movie such as this one, it really leaves an impression.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|I had a similar experience as many of these other reviewers. My husband came home one day and told me he heard the coolest song on the radio -  somebody was sampling Hall &amp; Oates! (whom we love). So we looked it up and saw that it was Simply Red, who of course we remembered from the 80's. So after watching the video on the web (verrry cool -check it out), I loved it too and we bought the CD.<BR>I hadn't bought a CD in a while, but I loved this one. It'so refreshing to have soulful, listenable music, all the way thru the CD. I got my co-workers hooked on it too. I'm definitely buying a copy for the office. Sunrise is the coooolest song!!!
B000002B49|5.0|I was absolutely amazed with Deep Forests debut album. It was and still is one of the most groundbreaking world music albums of all time and it's a huge crime that it isn't carried by retailers. It is still an amazing CD to this very day. It blended Pygmy voices with modern dance and the result was a masterpiece. This follow-up to that album entitled \\"Boheme\\" raises the bar even higher by having Deep Forest travel from the remoteness of Sub-Saharan Africa, to the forests of Bulgaria and Eastern Europe and the result is beyond what I could give out and \\"Boheme\\" is in my opinion, Deep Forest's best album to date although \\"Music Detected\\" may offer competition. The album has a much darker and more dramatic undertone than their debut album does but I love it.<br /> \\"Anasthasia\\" starts the album on a dark, eerie, and slightly ominous note with a very tribal sound with haunting flutes and a haunting ambience that gives the song a feel of like drifting through the forests of the Alps with nearby storms. Eventually the song gets more and more intense until it suddenly ends at just less than two minutes length. The echoes of \\"Anashthasia\\" perfect blend into the drama of my favorite track on this album \\"Bohemian Ballet\\". This is one of their best `studio' album tracks that they've ever created. At first, the clanging dance sound effects would imply a Latin folk track but it becomes a very intense, dramatic, and dark song. Things get even better when it becomes a vibrant and energetic dance song with haunting and bizarrely amplified Eastern European voices backed by the intense melody. This song is my favorite song on this entire album. \\"Marta's Song\\" is sheer beauty. After the dramatic darkness of \\"Bohemian Ballet\\", we emerge into the sunniness of \\"Marta's Song\\" which is another one of the highlights of this album. The song has a really excellent and exotic rhythm and the same is said about the haunting Bulgarian chants as well. Add that to a really warm and energetic melody and you have a really uplifting classic for the coming ages. \\"Gathering\\" is a much darker and more ominous track with a very futuristic production yet it also blends in ancient chorus and a really dark but never forboding atmosphere to create another intriguing and amazing classic. \\"Lament\\" is a really heartbreaking yet joyous song with a very strange electronic voice effect and bizarrely amplified voice effects. The melody is really awesome as well and the result is another highlight on this album. \\"Bulgarian Melody\\" is the strangest track on this CD. Although it starts with a dark and very eerie note and growing more and more dramatic, it calms down and becomes a very odd piano ballad with Bulgarian vocals amidst sweet and beautiful background piano in the background which almost gives the song a slight 1940s tone to it. While I totally disagree with a reviewer saying that this song is god-awful, it does feel sort of out of place against the other songs on this album but nonetheless it is a really great song. As it reverts back to the eerie sound that was present at the beginning, it morphs into a sweeter melody which becomes the track \\"Deep Folk Song\\" which is just a one minute interlude track but has a really vibrant French accordion style to it. In a way it's more of like an interlude intro into the vibrant classic \\"Freedom Cry\\". This is a really fun and actually a very bright, sunny and really happy song without being cheesy and is actually a very sophisticated song with an edgy and funky beat and a French accordion sound to it that gives the idea of a dance in an open paved plaza in Paris right after a storm moves out. A really amazing song it is. The song gracefully transitions into the next song \\"Twosome\\" which is another highlight on this album. This song has a rather slightly ominous melody but also a very joyous and exotic dance club sound. The Eastern Indian chanting gives the song a really colorful sound. It's hard to really explain this track but it'sa really awesome song that needs a listen. \\"Caf&eacute; Europa\\" is a really strange track with a stormy vibe and Asian exotic instruments. The song becomes a very club-oriented dance song that surely would make for excellent dance club music. While it's a very good song, it doesn't stack up as high as the other songs on this album. Still, it's a great song. The live version is incredible! \\"Kathrina\\" is a very spooky track. It begins with a very misty sharp-sounding flute or other wind instrument and becomes a very dark and haunting track with African beats and strange ominous melody. This is the darkest track on this album and it's a good one at that! The album closes with what I can safely say is the best track on this album which is the title track to this CD. While much of the album is dark and somewhat stormy in nature, the closing title track has a very happy and absolutely uplifting vibe and has a funky and exotic rhythm and colorful vocal effects. To me, this is like the sun shining bright after a major storm moving away into the east. This song brings an already phenomenal album to a glorious finish.<br /> Their debut album may have been what brought them into the spotlight but the way I look at it, \\"Boheme\\" was where they reached their peak although \\"Music Detected\\" may offer competition but these two albums have enormously different styles that it's impossible to compare them but they both showed that Deep Forest were unafraid to go into uncharted territory with their music. \\"Boheme\\" to me, built on the greatness of their debut and the result is what I consider to possibly be their best album that they've ever put out to date. I strongly suggest that you get a hold of a copy of this album. I don't know how much I can recommend it but I cannot do this album justice with this review.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|I watched Lost in Translation for the first time last night.  I find myself walking around today almost in a daze.  I liked it.  I'm not gushing about it but it feels right and good and real.  I don't think it was racist.  It was portraying what a real person would feel thrust into a place very different from his/her home.  I think that Coppola emphasized the cultural differences because she wanted the viewer to feel what the characters were feeling.  Culture shock!  Traveling to a country where you don't speak the language always feels like you're on another planet.  To a certain degree, every traveler brings with them a bit of racism, to be nice we call it ethnocentrism, but that doesn't make them a racist.     SPOILER AHEAD..............I also wanted to make a quick note about the ending that I know others have made as well.  The whole time that I was watching the movie, with the knowledge that it is rated R for some sexual content, I was concerned that I would have to see the pair take their relationship to a physical level.  I was so glad I was proved wrong.  The ending was absolutely perfect!  I love Bill Murray and I'm glad that he is finally getting recognition for his work.  Sometimes the look in his eyes in this movie made me feel exactly what his was trying to convey and thats rare in an actor.  I never knew what all the hype about Scarlett Johannsen was about and I never thought that I would like her, but she was incredible.  I saw parts of myself in her and completely identified with her.  I especially loved the shots of her wandering around sightseeing by herself.  I could almost see myself doing the same thing.  She has the ability to be normal and gorgeous at the same time.      Overall, this movie is not a grand, sweeping epic nor is it plot driven.  It is a beautiful, funny and thoughtful film that really showcases the talent of everyone involved.
B000006NUW|5.0|This is a very good compilation showing the glorious history of this classic label between 59-71. Be warned these are all MONO mixes, if you want the modernised stereo versions get the 3 CD set entitled 'Capital Gold - Motown Classics'. However if you want the real thing this compilation is the one, although I do agree that they should go for it and issue a mammoth box set in the vein of the Stax-Volt 28 CD issue that would cover every base.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|man this event was overly-hyped. a few matches were good but some were ... . BRock vs. Goldberg, the two big boys of RAW and SMACKDOWN!, that matched ... . It was kool to hear the crowd chanting \\"BORING!!\\" though ha. Undertaker's return ws cool though. I wont buy the dvd though.
B000002A3T|4.0|After purchasing dark side of the moon and listening to a lot of Pink Floyd music, I got interested in their most recent album, the division bell. While purchasing it, several questions emerged. Could it compare to pink floyd's earlier music? Would the band sound any different without Roger Waters? Will this rash ever go away? Well, as it turns out, Division bell is a good album. Not fantastic, but good. So let's rate this album!<br />1. Cluster One 10/10<br />a slow, calm song that makes a great opener to the album. The keyboard, guitar, and slow feel are all reminiscent of several of Pink Floyd's dark side of the moon songs.<br />2. What do you want from me 9/10<br />a nice, bluesy song thats good for a listen.<br />3. Poles apart 10/10<br />a very good song, featuring some nice acoustic guitar and with interesting lyrics.<br />4. marooned 10/10<br />another one of my favorites on the album, a nice instrumental piece that shows Pink Floyd can definatley still play<br />5. A great day for freedom 7/10<br />typical depresing Pink Floyd music, accompinied by piano and not much else. Its sort of a boring song, and not really one I like that much<br />6. Wearing the inside out 8/10<br />an okay song,good to listen to but nothing that special<br />7. take it back 7/10<br />8. Coming back to life 9/10<br />an improvment from the previous songs, and the following songs will only get better<br />9. keep talking 10/10<br />Finally, a really good song after some rather mediocre stuff in the middle. It makes me glad that a band thats been playing for so long can still play.<br />10. Lost for words 10/10<br />a very catchy song, really fun and interesting. Its kind of a song of hope, but also sort of negative at the same time. Its hard to explain.<br />11. High hopes 10/10<br />Another really good song, a great way to bring the album to a close. Also pretty catchy lyrics and piano, and the bells are in interesting addition to the song, albiet(I don't think I spelled that right) cliche.<br />total score: 99/110<br />I have some mixed opinions of the album. Part the album is not really that great. I don't really think filler is the right word, but I expect better from Pink Floyd. Its not the best, looking at Pink Floyds albums as a whole, but its not bad at all. Infact, I really thing I'm being too hard on the album. Its really not that bad, infact, I reccomend buying it if you like pink floyd. I just noticed several things about the album. The guitar is not as frequent as on most Floyd albums, and there's more acoustic than electric. Then again, I like acoustic guitar, and it does sound nice on this album as well. The lyrics are pretty depressing at times, but Pink Floyd does have a depressing side, and I don't really mind. Overall, it is a good album, though, and I hope you like it.
B00005JM02|1.0|This movie had to be one of the stupidest I've ever seen.  Unlike the previous Disney/Pixar efforts, this one isn't even remotely interesting.  The writers, from the looks of it, probably spent too much time working on the plot, and as a result it feels MUCH lacking, even moreso than A Bugs Life.  Not to mention that the film could have been ended a LOT earlier had they cut some of the uneeded parts out.  The jokes just aren't funny, and it's not for kids, as some parts will more than likely make them cry.  The visuals are decent, I guess, they're typical of what Pixar's been doing, no more, no less.  Overall, this is a very bad Disney film, and a disappointing Pixar film.  If you really need a Pixar movie, I suggest the Toy Story movies or even Monsters Inc, or if you just need a CGI movie, Shrek 1.
0385504209|1.0|I'm referring, of course, not to the plot but to this book's huge success. It has made very little impact here in the UK but is now being marketed very aggressively so no doubt will be a best-seller here, too. I found it poorly written and pretty boring, full of implausabilities. The story keeps stopping while the author shoehorns in huge chunks of information and clunky descriptions of Paris. So why are you all buying this book?
B0000CC5CS|3.0|Robots taking over the world thanks to an evil supercomputer. The way technology is going, I could see this very possibly happening. The only problem is, what would the robots do with the world after they take it over and kill all humans?<BR>This was the 1st terminator movie that I have seen that was in the theatres. My only other terminator experience was T2: 3D that's at the Universal theme parks, but the movie didn't have the most complex storyline, and I knew the basics, so I figured out most of it. How was the movie? The special effects were great. Industrial Light and Magic did it again. Besides from that, the dialogue was weak, the story was very predictable, and they told you what would happen next in the movie constantly so there were no suprizes. It also seemed like Arnold wrote himself out of the series if they do make a next one by killing his robot self and the world was basically destroyed at the end of the movie.
0140277447|5.0|Hey if you think that the author is lying then I believe you can ask any people from Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Philipines, Vietnam, Burma, Indonesia, Cambodia, Manchuria, Taiwan who had experienced the war. Or you can even ask old Japanese soldiers, who have human conscience, about what REALLY happened there. It may be easy to make one or two or even a group of people to lie. But I think it's impossible to make the entire world to lie. Also to all those japaese who think the rape of Nanking is a lie: if you have any common sense or you are not completely brain-dead you should ask WHY YOUR HISTORY TEXTBOOK ON WW2 IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD?!
B00005JN1L|4.0|Not being a horror/slasher movie fan, I was hesitant to see this movie.  I admire Johnny Depp's acting so I decided to see the movie.  I was pleasantly surprised. This is not a horror movie, it's a psychological study.  Depp's performance was wonderful, easing the seriousness of the script with his brand of humor. Unlike other reviews I've read, I was surprised at the ending, not what I was expecting.

B000002G87|5.0|On the surface this album looks like not much more than an extended drug-inspired jam session by five strung-out session musicians.  But delving further into the content, you quickly realize the story and the inspiration behind this masterpiece.  Be forewarned, this is not a feel good album.. The themes of intense pain, loss, desperation and utter hopelessness come through on virtually every track.  This is Clapton baring his soul for all to see - behind the guise of Derek and the Dominos.    In case you were born yesterday, this album is the cover for Clapton's then-obsession with Pattie Boyd (a.k.a. Layla) who was married to George Harrison at the time.  The album chronicles Clapton's love affair with Pattie and the depression and drug addiction that ensued as a result.  Out of all of this came surely the greatest 77 minutes of his career and some of the absolute greatest guitar work of all time.  After the 'Layla Sessions', Clapton spiraled downward into a serious, three-year depression and heroin addiction which nearly ended his life.    Enter Duane Allman.  In his short career, this man became the quintessential slide guitar player with a style that 30+ years later has not been matched.  His contributions to this album are enormous.  He only lived one full year after this album was released, but his impact on Derek on the Dominos was enormous.  The title track 'Layla' contains some of the most haunting slide and lead guitar harmonies EVER recorded.  Allman's slide harmonies literally 'cried' the pain that Clapton was living through in this song. They literally sound like a chorus of violins wailing during the Layla coda.  It can be tearful to listen how Duane captured Eric's pain so intensely.  Credit must also be given to the producer/engineer. Tom Dowd captured the exponential magic of these five musicians so flawlessly - especially in 'Layla'.  The album would be worth five starts on that one song alone.    But there is so much more.  Most of the songs in one way or another explore the hopelessness that Clapton faced in his obsession with Pattie.  'I looked Away' is a formidable opener to the set - perhaps Clapton realizing his lost opportunity to have her.  'I Am Yours' and 'Anyday' are touching ballads with acoustic and electric harmonies that blend perfectly.  Perhaps most interesting though is Clapton's classic remake of Hendrix's 'Little Wing'.  In 'Little Wing', he places Layla on the immortal pedestal that becomes his own undoing.  The wash of guitars heard through slide power chords and swirling harmonies really outdoes Hendrix.  He would have wanted this to be his own version.  'Thorn Tree in the Garden' (written by Bobby Whitlock for Clapton) is the bittersweet farewell to the love that he knows he cannot have.  It's like a eulogy for her - knowing she is gone.  \\"And if I never see her face again, I never hold her hand.  And if she's in somebody's arms, I know I'll understand...  But I miss that girl. I still miss that girl.  Maybe someday soon, somewhere.\\"    Sadly, Clapton's darkest days produced his finest work.  Listen to this album and you will understand.
0385504209|4.0|First off, as a story this book was wonderful.  It is one of those books that you really do not want to have to put down.  As far as a fictitious story is concerned it is a good read.<br />I did not like the fact that there was not good explanation and no support of all the claims in the book.  The author brings up ideas but never completes them.  I thought the book was susposed to be focused on a view of Jesus, but I was left with some strange sexual worship of Mary.  I walked away from the book wondering if the author was trying to proof anything or just write a good story.  He did the later of the two.<br />I would not recommend this book to younger readers.  There is language and explicit sexuality.<br />If you read this book, you might want to look into reading Breaking the Da Vinci Code which gives another viewpoint on the issues.
078324228X|2.0|Like Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK,&quot; this film raises the issue of whether to judge a movie by historical accuracy or simply by the standard of if it is an entertaining and well-crafted effort.  Anyone taking time to look at the evidence produced at the trials, will have to reach the conclusion that Carter, if not the gunman, was closely connected to the commission of the crime.  But should this matter to a movie-goer, who is looking for an enjoyable movie experience?  That being said, this is an okay effort, with plenty of drama for someone not familar with the story.  It has generated more interest, however, in the ensuing debate about the accuracy of the story as told in the film.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Yeah. Superb is just the word to describe this CD. From the start to the finish, take it from me, you will be ENTERTAINED! And I'm talking about people who're interested in some real good pop and rnb and dance kinda stuff. Do not judge this album by her previous albums. I assure you, this is different and much better. There are some great fast numbers as well as a couple of slow nice tracks. Over all, I'd give this album a ten on ten. People who should stay from this are Norah Jones fans, rock fans and music fans who are below 14. <BR>But if these restriction do not apply to you, you must get this right away. I'm very sure you will not be disppointed.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|Combining an alluringly smoky voice with sparky lyrics that hit their target every time, Fiona Apple has plenty of evident talent, and _When the Pawn_ showcases it brilliantly. Backed by musical arrangements ranging from smooth to catchy to quirky, Apple gives us here a collection of songs filled with dry, self-deprecating wit, spot-on observations and a striking emotional honesty. There's a precisely-worded insight into human weaknesses that's reminiscent of a less self-conscious (and self-consciously political) Ani Difranco. And in 'Limp' she provides the best Angry Young Woman song ever, both stirring and bitingly funny. Fabulous.
B000005JA8|1.0|What an out of tune bunch of nonsense!  This must be the bearded lady of music.  If you like this sort of thing, knock yourself out.  I like craziness as much as the next guy, but I'm never going to go home and swallow any swords (nor listen to this album again).
B000089RVX|1.0|The first time I listened to the CD, I loved it. After that, it went down hill. All the songs gets old really quickly. Along with radio play and TV play, it just gets very boring. All the song sound the same and it just doesn't cut it as a good CD at all.
B00005JN1L|2.0|I was disappointed.  It was too predictable toward the end. Johnny Depp was good.  But the show had violence that wasn't necessary and wasn't really scary. Too predictable.
B0001AP12G|1.0|His attempt at establishing himself as a hip-hop artist fails miserably much like the classes he must have taken in school. College is not for everyone, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Don't hate. It's obvious he does not have anything worth while to say. If he did, he would not have recorded that juvenille \\"Slow Jamz\\" If you want to know what lyrics are, what music is, then get Cee-lo's Soulmachine instead of this crap. Kids, don't believe the hype. Get an education or else you will turn out sounding as ignorant as Mr. West.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Jet is an amazing band. Finally some real rock n roll. No more of that depressing grunge or rap metal. Finally this album takes the origings from The Who and AC/DC. I love Jet. I met them, and went to their show. They are definitly becoming one of my favorite bands of all time. Everyone who loves rock n roll should buy this album. Cam Muncey has the best guitar riffs and the best music. I love Jet and get born. Cam is my guitar god!
B0001AP12G|1.0|This album sucks. Mr. West is a cliche. His music is a cliche. What he says has been said before.This CD is only for the shallow minded. He needs to finish his degree because once people find out he has hoodwinked them, his career will be over. He is the poster child for the staement &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;
0385504209|1.0|A little warmed over pseudohistory from the Discovery Channel, cardboard characters, and writing so amateurish it is painful to read: this is The Da Vinci Code. I hated this book. I only finished it because it was a Christmas present.<br />About halfway through I began to skim. I finished the last 100 pages in a half hour. That's about as much time as I think it's worth. Oh well, it was on sale and I can probably sell it to somebody else. I picked up another of Dan Brown's book, read the first page, and it was as badly written as this one was. That's all for me! I can bear no more.
B0001ENY6M|3.0|It was okay. The music seemed a lot better in the film than on CD. The CD is too quiet and calm for my tastes. I enjoy a couple of the tracks, but a majority of them are just so-so.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is an absolute disgrace.  Most will not understand my comments about this movie, but that would be due to a lack of knowledge on their part.  It made me so sad for the Veterans of Pearl Harbor, because they had to witness the ignorance of the individuals who said this was a good film.  I am disgusted by the Director, and every actor who participated in this travesty.<br />Shame on those who had something to do with this film.  Men died at Pearl Harbor.  For some one to take an event as sobering as this, and turn it into a joke, such as this movie, is sickening.  But, those who took part in this film sure got paid.  Blood money!!  Shame on all of you, and shame on who ever purchases this movie.  You should be thrown out of America!!<br />Go ask a WWII Vet and ask him what he thinks.  Most of those guys are pretty humble, so they won't state it like I have, but if you are not a fool you will see it in their eyes.  It is a shame what this country is coming to.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I love this soundtrack, it's one of the best I have. However it is too short, only about 45 minutes. And themes from the Gladiator soundtrack seemed to creep in a bit. Other that it's wonderfully done.
B00018TI5E|5.0|i've always been a fairly big fan of rhcp, but i always just kind of looked at john as the finest guitarist of the chili peppers. i never bothered to go as far as to look into any solo work he had done. but i'm glad i am now, shadows collide is awesome. i didnt realize john was such a good lyracist and vocalist, he pours his soul into all these songs. the guitar work for obvious reasons has some similarities to rhcp, but john experiments a little more with ambient sounds and such, most songs have very nice backing vocals as well. i can't even pick a favorite, they're all truly great songs. fans of the chili peppers won't be dissapointed. this is easily the best album of 2004 to date.
B00004RD54|5.0|I don't agree with the reviewer!  I enjoy this album as much as I did in 1973 or 1974, when I first heard it.  The intro to Sweet Jane is by far one of the best examples of rock and roll I've ever heard.  I know plenty of folks who feel the same way.   I'm a lot older and ... well older, but I still want to jump up and play air-guitar on this one.   Lou Reed is an acquired taste that  a lot of people  just don't acquire.  But if you like him, this is a great example of one part of the musical journey this crazed artist has been on.  <br />DON'T pass it by because of the opinion of some Lester Bangs type.
B000089RVX|5.0|Ok i'm not a crazed fan of evanescence...I don't have posters or ane thing and i don't obsess over them as much as other ppl. Evanescence is a great band with kool sonz. The only reason i bought the CD was to listen to &quot;Bring Me To Life.&quot; I wasn't expecting to actually like the whole CD. I can relate to every song surprizingly. This is a great band as i've said, and with Amy Lees talented voice..they will go far...
B00003CXDD|5.0|I am watching this movie again for an uncountable time, fastfowarding through the commercials from some long ago Christmas taping.  <BR>I think the time has come to buy an actual, commercial free copy.  It is lots of fun to watch.
B00005JMNA|5.0|i love the movie! the music and the dancing ia amazing! i love diego luna or javier in the movie! i fell in love with hem and the movie. if you have not seen it you  need to its the best movie ever.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin Degraw is an amazing artist!!!!. I wish I could give him 10 stars. He is the type that does not come around very often. He writes his own lyrics...that are not just &quot;catchy but true to life. From his song about the beauty of life called Chariot to the comical Chemical Party. He is a great musician, who is great live. His performances capture the whole crowd. He has over 200 reviews on amazon alone and the critics have to admit he is a freash face in music. People pick up and listen to his cd....by the time you finish you will be a Gavin Degraw fan for life :-)
B000001EL3|5.0|This album is a huge classic and will never be forgotten!!! All of the songs on here are KISS classics!! Beth there first top ten hit is the song that would transform KISS into superstars!! It was a filler for the album and the band didn't think it would be noticed, but they were wrong. There were 6 hits on this album, Detroit Rock City, King of the night time World, God Of Thunder, Do you love me, Shout it out loud, and Beth!!!
B00005MNP7|5.0|For years bands have had a hard time following up a hugely successful and often groundbreaking CD with a worthy followup, Blondie pulled it off here. Dreaming, The hardest part and Union City blue and Shayla are pop masterpieces. My three favorites are Living in the real world, Accidents never happen and Eat to the beat as they harkened back to Blondie's punky side (very Rip her to shreds like). This CD shows off many musical styles and showcases how good musically the band was. This should have been a bigger hit than it was.
B000089RVX|1.0|The person who said this is goth-rock, and whatever the name of the singer is is a goth singer, mainstream cannot be classified as gothic music. If you want something that CAN be classified as gothic, listen to Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, etc. This is mainstream crap. If I saw Cradle of Filth on MTV I would lose all respect for them, because they would be sellouts. And if you think you are hardcore because you are listening to this album, go listen to Cradle Of Filth's Damnation and a Day and prepare to be blown away. The best girl singer with a gothic-rock band is the girl from Cradle of Filth in some of their songs. This album is vehement. Down with this appaling cd. I'll say it again, if you want to become gothic, listen to Cradle of Filth, or any black-metal. Tell me if any of the lyrics on this cd can compare to: I shall bow no more to the dogs of the lord tearing at my carcass heart. I shall fall to my knees only at the keyholes of virtue slipping into bondage masks. Freewill made me better to reign in hell. NO. Nothing can compare to that. This is for posers, and little girls who think it makes them cool to listen to this. It doesnt.
B00005MNP8|5.0|If I could only bring 10 CD's to a desert island, this is one of them. Totally pop with an edge to it. 11:59, One way or another, Hanging on the telephone are some of the highlights on this, but each song is different than the other. This is a masterpiece plain and simple.
0385504209|5.0|I found this book to be an excellent read and a very suspenseful thriller.  Dan Brown is an amazing author and I know that I will be reading his books until the very last one.<br />The book starts out with a Harvard symbologist named Robert Langdon is staying in Paris for a while.  He was suppose to have a drink with a man by the name of Jacques Sauniere who is the curator of the Louvre, the museum that is home to the classic and beautiful Mona Lisa.  But later that evening, Langdon received a very rude awakening from the French police force saying that Sauniere had been murdered.  Since Langdon was suppose to be the last to have seen Sauniere, he was a prime suspect to the murder.  Sauniere had left a message on the floor with a pen that only shows up in a black light and Langdon's name was in it.  This made him very nervous.  This is when a young and beautiful young lady named Sophie Neveu entered the story.  She worked for the Police as a cryptologist and was the granddaughter to the late Sauniere.  Sophie new that Langdon was innocent and would stop at nothing to prove it to the police.  That included breaking the law and turning them both in to fleeing fugitives.  Also in the words left on the floor by the curator was a code that lead the two new fugitives to a key that opened a safety deposit box in a very private bank.  This lead the two explorers into a great journey for what they would soon find to be the Holy Grail itself, or rather, her self.<br />This book points out things about religion and the Holy Grail that are very fascinating and intrigued me to the point of continuing research on the subject.  The Da Vinci Code is a book that grabs your attention from the very beginning and doesn't let go at any given moment.  It was very well written and very well researched.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves thrillers and mysteries.
B00018TI5E|5.0|In a age of hype I can only write as a music lover discussing my own feelings about this album. I have been waiting for this album for a long time, and I'm truly satisfied. I feel John takes more chances than most artists. I think It takes Guts to be who you are to make an album like this.<br />I've read some reviews saying if you like the chili Peppers this isn't the album for you. I know what they mean by that. because I used to say the same thing. Even when I think I'm open minded, I realise how narrow minded I can be. I came to the understanding, that He's in the Chili's because he likes them. and Actually anyone who is a Chili Fan Should buy this album. people who are used to main stream music should be more exposed to this type of music.<br />There are all kinds of music, Real music that touches the nerve, give you a chill, and affects every emotion. An album like this should truly be promoted without hype.<br />So therefore I recomend this album to anyone looking for really good music.
B00009Y3L4|1.0|CABARET is one of the greatest movie musicals ever. I adore it. It is flawless, IMHO.<br />Why, then am I giving it one star? Because, as others have said, Warners should be ashamed of themselves. This is not the first, but the SECOND release of this movie in a non-anamorphic transfer. I bought the original and was mighty p****ed because it was non-anamorphic. I thought they would have honored this magnificent film in the &quot;anniversary&quot; release. But no. It is, as stated by another reviewer, the same disc as before, in terms of picture quality.<br />On a small TV you won't notice. But if you care about these things, then believe me, this release sucks big time. As did the first one.<br />I'm angry, not at being ripped off (I sent this one back for a refund) but because a wonderful work of art has been abused by a greedy, careless film company. And I have been robbed of the chance to see the film in its glory.<br />Having said that, nothing could improve the truly dreadful sound quality - which was terrible from day one.<br />I don't suppose there ever will be another release of this movie. What a terrible shame.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; original score is great music for the powerful and controversial film that has been receiving rave reviews.  Its theme for every song blends perfectly with the movie scene theme.  Its beautiful music alone captures listeners' hearts.  Every song forces listeners to feel the characters' emotions and the events in the individual scene.  Even those who are not religious will feel it.  According to its impact, composer John Debney obviously felt passionate about the film.  This may be one of many characteristics that makes this score this brilliant.  The performances from the musicians are beautiful: the orchestra, the chambers, the choir, etc.  They express every music note emotionally, which adds more power.  The soul is never lost for a second in one song.  This album offers its own journey through the film.  Such musical quality makes &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; original score an unforgettable experience.  This will surely please many listeners.  Those pleased with this album should also watch the film if they haven't already.
B00005JN1L|5.0|When I went to see the film The Secret Window I all ready knew how it would end (thanks to someone who, in their online reveiw, wrote out the ending of the movie without writing SPOILER at the top...i mean, really, is it so much to ask that you at least warn me befor giving away the ending???) <br />The point I am trying to make about this movie is that it EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THE ENDING, there were so many exciting twists and turns that I still found the movie both highly entertaining and suspenceful. Wich, I think, goes to show you how great the movie is.
0446677450|2.0|Many people disagree with me on this one as well!!  All I can say is if you choose to buy this book, read it - then set it aside.  Pick it up again in 6 months and see if it changed your life or bank account.  If it did - Good for you!  If not, resell it along with everybody else that bought it.   After reading this book I am led to believe making money is more emotionally challenging than intellectually difficult.  Mr. Kiyosaki is part cheerleader, part salesman/coach.  The following are the three things you will get out of this book: the importance of  being able to read an Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and understand the importance of Cash Flow.  However, my 16 years of schooling, 12 years of work as well as the 20 different jobs I have taken since the age of 12 has taught me that there is more to making money then Mr Kiyosaki leads you to believe.  It is a nice story and easy to read.  I am glad HE is successful, however I am left with many questions.  It seemed to me to be incomplete. In the end, I believe that the book fails to present any original or innovative thinking
B00005JLO2|5.0|i found this movie to be great with nothing wrong with it.<BR>can't believe the low ratings given.  i rented it on a whim,<BR>and found another movie to add to my collection.
0767817478|3.0|When I watched Godzilla in the theater it was several weeks after the initial panning reviews came out. I felt then that a lot of the criticism was unwarranted. Watching the movie this time around on DVD, I concede that not all the criticism was off base and the movie is certainly a lot less fun. Some of that is the filmmakers' fault (it's too long, Godzilla's size and weight seem inconsistent, assorted plot holes), but some has to do with things that have happened since the movie was made. In a post-9/11 world, watching New York City come crashing down is a lot less enjoyable. And since Gene Siskel's passing, the parody of him and Ebert feels cheap and mean-spirited (granted, it was likely heartfelt at the time, but as a legacy piece it just grates me).  <br />There are some decent extras on the DVD, though. The commentary by members of the F/X team is good, as is the video, \\"Heroes,\\" by The Wallflowers. The movie trailers are well done, and took me back to the time when I anticipated great things from the film. The featurette is above-average, mainly because of Harry Shearer's narrative skills.<br />This isn't a great film (neither were the originals), but the effects are nice to look at. I've found it enjoyable to have playing in the background while I'm doing other things. I can watch a scene or two, then go do other things, and come back later for another few. Taken in one sitting, though, it's just too long and over time my interest wanes.<br />If you like effects-laden movies, this one has some scenes that are real doozies. How well it retains your attention - or whether or not it wears you out with the non-stop chase sequences - will, of course, vary from one viewer to the next. As a low-priced DVD it's not a bad purchase, even if you only watch it once in a great while.
B00009P1O0|5.0|...is my jaw dropping. Thank you Neil Young for finally getting &quot;On the Beach&quot; out on CD. The remastering is amazing--you can hear everything so clearly. After 6 months of listening to it, this has joined &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; as my favorite NY album(s).<br />There really isn't a bad song. &quot;Vampire Blues&quot; is a bit shallow, both musically and lyrically, but I can't seem to get it out of my head either. &quot;See the Sky about to Rain&quot; is touching. &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; is a great rocker, both in spirit and sound. &quot;On the Beach&quot; is cathartic. &quot;Motion Pictures&quot; knocks me out. &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; is Neil Young's &quot;Desolation Row.&quot; I'm not sure why it's a transcendent song, but it is.<br />You'll notice that three songs are name 'blues,' but only one of them (vampire) actually qualifies as a blues song. My take on it is that the whole album is actually a blues album. It's just a new type of blues. Like the ocean on the cover, it's a *sky blue*. Neil Young is channeling music to address his and the world's problems. He emerges better than we could have expected.
B00009RDG9|4.0|Give this film a second chance, a lot of people thinks it sucks!<BR>This is a raw bare to the bone action film with two quality actors. Benicico Del Toro is chilling as an unhinged military specialist;with his deadly uses of knifes. The first twenty minutes show this in spectacular fashion. Tommy Lee Jones may have played his hunter act one time too many, but he is really effective. <BR>People may accuse William Friedkin of being a director for hire in his later work, he still has a few tricks up his sleeve.<BR>For example The last knife fight at the end of the film is grossly effective.
B00005JKDR|5.0|If any of you have kids out there, GET THIS MOVIE. My two absolutely love this one. I do too. Everytime they watch this movie, they (we) are glued to the set. It doesn't scare them at all. Pixar made a beautiful looking &amp; sounding with a great story line. I can't say enough how much I love this movie!
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is a great and funny movie and one of the best that the Python team came up with! And the 2 disc edition here is great, but i recomend you get a good price! The bonus features are packed into 2 discs but there not somthing you would watch over and over again! The movie is worth it mostly just for the classic film, and the people who have seen and loved the film will enjoy the bonus materials, espechelly the return to locations where it was filmed, and seeing what it looked like when they did the documentry in 2000 or whenever?
B000053VAZ|4.0|for anyone who just loves a really great, really cute, not so based in reality, movie.  No, it's not all that deep and is a little on the make believe side, but it's a wonderful love story that makes you say &quot;Aaahhhhhh!&quot;  Johnny is wonderful and shows just how versatile he is as an actor.  The entire cast is good.  The film has a timeless feel to it, which adds to its appeal.  It may not have been a blockbuster hit or go down in history as the best movie of all time, but a great movie to watch if your in the mood for Johnny Depp and a pick-me-up romance.
B000060K4P|5.0|Ghostbusters has always been one of my favs! And this DVD release has a been difitally remastered and includes a few newly done scenes! There not brand new scenes or redone completly, the scene is still there, it just has a bit of addition to the end battle with Goza and shows the building a bit more! You wont notcie it really!<br />Ghostbusters 1 is a great comedy that changed the way people looked at ghosts and ghost effects! These days the FX might look a bit dodgy compared to what they can do these days, but remember they didnt have the tech we have now back then, and this was breaking FX when these movies came out, and they defnitly did a great job with it!<br />On the first disc you get a few bonus features of trailers , deleted scenes, and a few extras, and of coarse your usualy auiod commentry! <br />The disapointing bit was I never heard the story of how Ghostbusters came about! Dan Akroyds brother really is an actualy Ghostbuster! They dont catch ghosts or do anything like in this film, but his brother is a paranormal investigator and thats were the idea for this movie began!<br />Part 2 is a movie that wasnt too bad. but it was not as good as the first! Far from it! But at least the same cast returned and there are far worse movies out there to say it was a bad movie! It may not contain any bonus features on that disc, but its still good to have the collection of both films!<br />Its a shame when in 1998 the go ahead for Ghostbusters 3 was cancelled. Bill Murry did not want to take place in it, at least they know that a sequll wont work without the original cast! <br />But these 2 movies are worth getting for your collection if you enjoy paronormal comedies!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Was at Best Buy the other day looking for DVDs and it was on sale for 7.50.<br />Brought it home with absolutely no expectation of it being a good movie and turned out I really enjoyed it.  If you have not seen it you should definitely pick up a copy and watch it.  It is still on my mind a few days after seeing it.
B00000G3PL|5.0|What I consider to be not just the best Mel Gibson or Danny Glover films, but also there not many movies made that you can say that the sequlls are not just as good as the original, or maybe even better!<br />Starting from part one you have Mel Gibson and Danny glover, and then in part 2 the action continues and introduces a new charactor &quot;Leo Getz&quot;(Joe Pesci) who adds a new twist to the great L.A Cop duo! Then part 3 introduces &quot;Rene Russo&quot; (Launa) who brings a kick arse action figure for women! Then Part 4 brings in the martial arts star &quot;Jet Li&quot; and funny man &quot;Chris Rock&quot;!<br />So as the movies progress, the story just gets better and better and the cast get bigger and bigger! all 4 of these movies are great and you wont be disapointed in this purchase! <br />I'm reveiwing the regoin 4 discs that the first 3 films are &quot;Directers cut&quot; editions and part 4 contains English Subtitles and Danny Glovers hosting into the behind the scenes of the leathel weopen movies, with the cut scenes, deleted scenes, outtakes and more great features! This pack is worth the money if your into highly packed great action adventure with that comic spirit but yet beleivable touch to it!
0385504209|1.0|A bit too James Bondy for me.<br />While the historic accuracy is debatable, I did however enjoy the mockeries Leonardo DaVinci placed within his paintings.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This is a great movie that Speilberg and Donnar have made here! A town under threat of beeing bought out by a company who want to make it a golf coarse seem to have lost the battle and are about to pack up, untill a group of kids who call them selves gooneis find a tresure map and go hunting for pirate gold!<br />Along the way they meet some bad guys and recruit some members of various ages and is filled with comedy, suspence and wont leave your bored out of your brain!<br />The bonus features are pretty good, tho mind you, i'm not a fan of Cindy Laupher, and her video clip seems to go forever filled with not just the actors of the movie, but a bunch of 80's pro wrestlers as well! IF you have never seen this movie before, then i recomend buying it! If you have seen it and dont have it on DVD, you wont regret buying it if you liked it!<br />It would be nice to have a directoers cut that showed the deleted scenes within vewing of the movie like on some TV showing of the film, but there still there as a bonus feature on there own!
B00018TI5E|5.0|This is by far the best solo effort by John Frusciante.  His music really comes together beautifully on this CD.  Even if you haven't been a fan of his previous solo efforts, this is well worth the money.  Much more polished, beautiful melodies, a definite for John fans and Red Hot Chili Pepper fans who have enjoyed their last two CDs - By The Way &amp; Californication.  This will be in my top 5 favorite CDs!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie is for anyone who likes unconventional, un-hollywood romantic comedies.  Sure, the laughs aren't one-liners given with a sly, knowing wink every two minutes, but the subtlty of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson's performances are brilliant.  Their's is a love story, but an unconventional one that's more realistic and more honest than any other romantic movie out there.  The movie is sweet, soft, quietly funny, subtle and wholly original.  If you like unconventional characters in an unconventional place with an unconvntional story, then this is for you.  If you want a trite, by-the-book, mass-produced hollywood &quot;romantic comedy&quot; where every character is a cookie-cutter and every story is the same, then this probably isn't for you.
B000002WPI|1.0|I love rap. But Wut Tang is garbage. With high expectations I heard this album, and im like WTF is this. its trash, pure trash. the beats are horrible, and the lyrics are too. <BR> <BR> W U T A N G S T I N K S B A D L Y.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|First off I would like to state i am by no means a die hard dream theater fan.I do very much so enjoy thier music tremendously and have great respect for the musicians,I play bass myself.Well all the reviewers seem too either love or hate this album and a few find it to be a mix bag.Well I suppose I am one of those few.The cd opens up with the mainstream sounding \\"as I am\\" but i find it to be very catchy and well written.The next song \\"this dying soul\\" is a huge let down from as i am.It sounds completley uninspired. The same goes for the next two tracks and with a rap in a Dream Theater song it just doesnt work.\\"Vacant\\" is a nice little song a huge relief from the past three tracks.Now comes \\"stream of consciousness\\".All I can say is wow what a great song,one of the best ive heard from dream theater.The last song \\"in the name of god\\" is a trying to have same sound as \\"this dying soul\\" and such but is written so much better.It seems Dream Theaters \\"Train of Thought\\" is an attempt to win new fans(yes those nu metal fans).Hopefully Dream Theaters next album will be only artisticly driven.
B00005JN1L|5.0|This past weekend, my family and I decided to catch the new Johnny Depp movie. When I first saw the trailers for Secret Window, I thought it was going to be just another insane, slaying movie without a plot and without any real acting talent in it. Boy was I wrong!!! The movie is based on the Stephan King novels, Secret Window and Secret Garden, and knowing this, I knew this movie was going to be a suspenseful thriller. Johnny Depp plays a well-known writer who lately is having an extreme case of writer's block. Now he just sits around in his worn, old bathrobe and talks to his dog, mostly because his wife left him about six months ago for another man. To add to his problems, a stranger from Mississippi comes knocking on his door one day and accuses Mort (Johnny Depp), of stealing his story, Secret Window. Mort becomes fed up with the stranger who calls himself Shooter (John Turturro), and ignores his accusations. But now strange things begin to happen; to Mort, and his family. Mort soon discovers that Shooter is the one reeking havoc on his life. Shooter demands that Mort fix the ending of Secret Window to the way it \\"should be\\" and to re-publish it under Shooter's name. He wants the new ending to be that the character kills his wife and buries her in the garden, under the attic's secret window. Mort still refuses to listen to Shooter, and the deadly \\"accidents\\" keep on happening. Eventually Mort understands the real reason why Shooter is stalking him, and why the ending of Secret Window needs to be changed. I'm not going to give away the ending because I must say it is one of the MOST unexpected and thrilling finales I have ever witnessed! The repeated saying , \\"the only thing that matters is the ending\\", is a major element throughout this movie. <BR>  What really made this movie so believable and terrifying was the acting. Johnny Depp's character makes us all jump whenever he opens a closet to discover something or wakes up from his daily nap to find terror rightin front of him. And also John Turturro's \\"Shooter\\" make's us all think twice before opening the door. This horror film gets an A+ from my family and me! Secret Window will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time and will leave you breathless with an ending to 'die' for!
B00005KHJM|2.0|The rave reviews are puzzling. At best, this film is one of the great might-have-beens of cinema history. It has a good idea, a good basic story, a decent clash between natural and revealed religion, fertility and self-denial, and at least two competent performances: Woodward and Cilento could have carried the theme. It has occasional flashes of inspiration. The location is good. The wicker man image is uniquely memorable. But it is so uneven it positively bumps; liking riding over giant cobbles on a bike with two punctures. Presumably it's the fault of having a director with no experience, and nil sense of mood or pacing. Britt Ekland is dreadful, and Christopher Lee (tremendous when in type) is totally physically unsuited to his part. I couldn't take my eyes off his frightful wig, aside from which he's about a foot taller than everyone else, has no earthly rhythm at all, and it shows. Perfect for Dracula of course. The extras include an unwatchable interview with an American who seems to have been promised 100 bucks for every time he coughs up another puff. This is the clumsiest promotion of its type I have ever seen. Shaffer is his normal unbearable self; but the featurette explaining some of the difficulties of making the film, and its wierdly occult survival against all odds and everything the suits could throw at it, as well as its growth as a cult, is pretty interesting. Ingrid Pitt has a realistic take on the thing. Like I said, I thought the Shaffer-generated plot was ingenious: in fact I was quite mystified for about 2/3rds of the way. I was well fooled by the weather cover-up, and wouldn't have known May was being filmed in November. The tropical plants were an oddly effective exotic touch. In the hands of a subtle and sensitive director the whole thing could have been as terrific as the fans seem to want it to be. As it is, it's just bits and pieces of an unfinished jigsaw. A Midsummer Night's Nightmare it isn't.
0425170349|5.0|This is Clancy at his best.  There are costs to everything.  On the far right, there is the side-effects and pitfalls of a military war on drugs (Clear and Present Danger).  On the far left, there is radical environmentalists (who consider humans a parasite on planet Earth who should be destroyed).  <br />What Clancy really writes about is the costs involved in any kind of political change, and the dangers of extremists.  Clancy always takes very real political situations one step further.  Is it right for radical Muslims to promote nuclear war (The Sum or All Fears).  Is it right for radical enviormentalists to commit genocide (Rainbow Six). Plus, what would happen if an honest, non-political man found himself in the position of George Washington - faced with rebuilding the government from the ground up - but with a press who was so used to lies and political posturing they didn't know how to deal with an honest man who was doing his best (Executive Orders).  <br />What I would believe is somebody who admits there are no easy answers.  The far left would undermine national security; the far right would eliminate privacy rights.  Clancy solutions are often poetic justice (the wacko enviromentalists being forced to live in the jungle without ANY technology from a knife to clothing - all that was part of technology, not nature, plus a drug lord, which the US decided they had no legal right to keep, being delivered to his opposition in Columbia).
B00004RJ74|5.0|I've found it sadly amusing that so many people who reviewed this film have NO IDEA what they're talking about. First off, (and I'll be directing the rest of these towards reviewer &quot;G-Money&quot;), this isn't a Quentin Tarantino film. This movie was directed by Robert Rodriguez. Quentin merely wrote the screenplay. <br />Since when was Tarantino dialogue senseless? He's renouned in the industry for having the most cutting dialogue around.<br />So, because he wrote the screenplay to a violent movie, he's murderer at heart? Then I suppose Scorsese and Hithcock are murderers too...wait...so by your logic everyone that enjoyed this film must be a sadist? That's wonderful. Plenty of people enjoy this movie, and even more (I would wager the vast majority of serious film fans) enjoy his masterpieces: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. These people are not sadists, and anyone with a head upon their shoulders should realize this. Anyone who appreciates film should be able to appreciate Quentin for the brilliant filmmaker he is (sans From Dusk Till Dawn, which isn't even HIS FILM!). Now, you may not fit into said categories, or maybe you just haven't seen any of Quentin's real films (as you seem to be confused as to who he is). The latter is perfectly forgiveable...although it seems, (from your review) that you have. In which case, you are truly missing out, and you have my sympathy. They are among the greatest cinema has to offer.<br />Maybe I'm asking too much of you...you don't seem to be the kind of person that takes film seriously. I mean, just glancing of the films you've given four and even five stars, I find generic and trendy titles (all of the following being sub-par to TERRIBLE) such as: Rush Hour 2, Bad Boys 2, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, Anger Management, They, The remake of Rollerball, Ghost Ship, The Transporter, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, Batman and Robin, etc...you can see a trend. This is truly a sad thing, that someone can have such a distorted perception of film...such as Quentin Tarantino being a sick hack, and Batman and Robin being brilliant, worthy of 5 stars. I assume you're really young and you haven't yet matured in terms of film taste. I hope you will. <br />I wish you a better movie going future, and I pray you get a greater respect for the great, BRILLIANT Quentin Tarantino, as well as film in general.
B000002MUQ|5.0|This is an example of REAL musicians writing excellent pop songs. Songs like &quot;Take Me Back(Deja Vu)&quot;, &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, &quot;Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, &quot;Not Enough&quot; and last but not least &quot;Feelin&quot; are written with such talent that you can hardly stop listening to it.  The istrumentals are fun as well.  The &quot;Seventh Seal&quot; is not my favorite but it is still a good Sammy-era song.  It was an excellent last(?) album for the Red Rocker. Hopefully, the band can come to it's senses and get back with one of the best rock singers of all time.  Nobody can match his vocal skills.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Madonna has always amazed me, from the things she says and the things she does, but no matter how wild she used to be and has continued to be (hence Britney French Kiss) Madonna can say she has the talent to back all those crazy antics up. This is the Greatest Hits-the second half. I do beleive it covered it's basic ground but if you are a semi-die hard fan (like me) or a real die-hard fan (like a friend of mine) you were probably a little bit dissapointed at some of the song selections which is most of everyone's gripes on this review page. I fully agree with some of you. <BR>Madonna, must have been beaten down by the so-called &quot;badness&quot; of her 1992 effort &quot;Erotica&quot; and just tack on two songs from the &quot;risque&quot; album, when we all know full well that &quot;Rain&quot; (my all-time favorite Madonna song-a true piece of poetry), &quot;Bad Girl&quot; and the upbeat, jiving Peggy Lee remake &quot;Fever&quot; were so criminally missing. Also from that year from Madonna's movie &quot;A League Of Their Own&quot;- &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot; was a miss and so was another stellar slow jam, &quot;I'll Remember&quot; from the movie &quot;With Honors&quot;. Where were these? Hmm...also I wondered where &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;I Want You&quot; were? Like they didn't even exsist or something! <BR>Still I gave it five stars due to the mature take Madonna has turned too, and it's evident through this album. &quot;Deeper And Deeper&quot; is a glorious dance track that just jams. &quot;Erotica&quot; which we all know with it's hip-hop jungle beat (one that got my mom to raise an eyebrow). The cool vibe of &quot;Human Nature&quot; backed with the guitar strumming laid back vibe of &quot;Secret&quot; (which was produced by Dallas Austin whom has helped one of my fave groups, TLC). &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; is just too weird for my taste and &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; showcases Madonna giving her all in a lush but forcefulballad from her highly acclaimed movie &quot;Evita&quot;. &quot;The Power Of Goodbye&quot; is another favorite of mine with it's lush techno backing and it has wonderful lyrics! A masterpiece! &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; from Austin Powers, is not my cup of tea, but &quot;Frozen&quot; sure was, which was a song that kinda grew on me, plus the lyrics are pretty good. &quot;Take A Bow&quot; is glorious, while &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; makes me wanna get in my car and drive &quot;faster than the speed of light&quot;. The rooting-tooting pop fun of &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is next followed by the oh-so true girl power of &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;. &quot;Drowned World/Subsitute For Love&quot; starts out slow and calming and then climaxes to a roaring climb. Then &quot;Music&quot; ends with it's techno, pop and hip-hop vibe that makes you wanna spin a record and jam with Madonna on the dance floor, like in the video. <BR>Yeah, yeah, so it wasn't the correct versions from the albums, and yeah, yeah she was missing some essential stuff but all in all this album showcases the works of a musicial genius during a turning point in her career, with this stuff she went from being the Material Girl to the Mature Goddess.

B000099T2L|2.0|Like most people who bought this record I loved the Crazy In Love single. It's funky as hell, it's polyrhythmic, it's sassy, it's got a cool keyboard hook, some curious and quite syncopated vocal lines, and it sticks in your brain like sellotape to fingers.<br />PURELY on the strength of this (... ah, ok, and the video) I thought - that Beyonce Knowles, she's one talented lady - I have to buy this record.<br />I bet I wasn't the only one.<br />So imagine my surprise & alarm when, as opening track Crazy In Love fades out, the clever production, the aforesaid great funky beats and honkin' attitude evaporates into thin air and you're left with an album of indescribably dull R+B schmaltz? Actually, I should have picked it by looking at the track listing: The Luther Vandross duet ought to be a dead giveaway, if you think about it.<br />It's the oldest trick in the book - lure the customer into the store with well-wrapped (...ahem) package - well, you can hardly deny Beyonce Knowles is an attractive package, can you - and then sell 'em the full set of encyclopaedias before they know what they've done.<br />Shame on you, Sony!<br />Olly Buxton
B00018D44U|5.0|With &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot; and &quot;Carnival Town&quot; Jones ushers in more gentle sauntering and jazz-sweet reflection, but this time the understated dirt-track atmospheres don't just conjure pretty twilight moods; they convey a beauty and a powerful emotional cache that lingers. Likewise, &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; murmurs with tender sadness while the low-slung swagger of &quot;In the Morning&quot; broods with so much lip-curling passion it's almost seedy. However, the proof of just how far Jones has come lies in &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot;. A humbling end-of-the-affair lullaby built around the two-in-the-morning piano of Duke Ellington's instrumental &quot;Melancholia&quot;, it's as moving as it is brave.
B00007JVBI|5.0|Chan Marshall has finally managed to combine the soft coziness of 'Moon Pix' with the raw emotion of 'What Will The Community Think', & the result is unbelievable lovely.<br />'You Are Free' is crafty, melodic, layered, painful, beautiful & inspired.  Its' quiet spaces give way to angry lamentations that manage to flow together seamlessly.<br />If you're into early PJ Harvey (esp. her demo work) the Cowboy Junkies 'Whites Off Earth Now' album, Edith Frost, or Patty Griffin's first album- then this is an absolute must!<br />Anyone who can sing, \\"turn out the lights, set yourself on fire, say goodnight,\\" & make it sound sexy & like a piece of freedom, deserves attention.<br />Highly, Highly recommended!

B000000OAA|5.0|Though they're not labelled as such, I think Queen are the true definition of &quot;progressive rock&quot;.  Even bands that fall under that label like Yes and Genesis, though they are progressive, seem to follow a similar formula most of the time.  Queen tends to jerk you around like the Scrambler ride at your local county fair.  I guess you could say that they do have a formula-the fact that they always try something different.  Queen change music styles and subject matter like my wife does clothing, but always maintain their signature sound.  There is just absolutely nobody like Queen-never has been and never will be.  Sheer Heart Attack is a fantastic place to start, and if you like Queen and don't have it, shame on you!  Don't go buying some Greatest Hits compilation and think you have all the Queen that matters.  You're not even close!  Although Queen II remains my favorite, this album is fan-frickin-tastic.  You get a bunch of songs of all different styles, none of them bad.  After hearing &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, you can safely credit Queen with writing the first speed metal song.  Even Black Sabbath weren't advanced enough to pull this off.  In fact, the riff for Sabbath's &quot;Symptom Of The Universe&quot; sounds very similar to &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;.  So, basically what it boils down to is if you like Queen, there's no reason why you shouldn't have this.
0440237688|5.0|This is the best book ever! My English teacher was doing a sci-fi unit and to finish it up, we read The Giver. At first I was like ugh! I hate science fiction books, but then one day I had to stay home from school because I felt aweful. We were reading chapter 3 in class that day, so I decided it would be a good idea to read it. But after chapter 3, I went on to chapter 4, then 5, and then I couldn't stop. I read the whole book in 2 hours. If I were you, I would buy this book asap!
B00004RFFS|3.0|This wasn't that interesting to me as the other Vampire Chronicles, but still good. It was told from Louis' point of view, so lestat seemed rather...&quot;bad.&quot; I didn't liek Claudia all too much either.
B000001EGE|5.0|&quot;Honky Chateau&quot; has always been my favorite Elton John album, with &quot;Don't Shoot Me ...&quot; a close second.  If these two had been released together as a double album, I think they would be even better than &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;.  As great as they were, the three albums prior to &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; (&quot;Elton John&quot;, &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;, and &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot;) just hinted at what was to come.  Although Elton had always used great musicians (Caleb Quaye, Roger Pope, etc.) this is the first album where Davey Johnstone, Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson play on the entire record.  For whatever reason, this combo just clicked when it came to playing good old fashioned straight-ahead rock &amp; roll.  Add a few Frenchmen on horns and the great fusion jazz player, Jean-Luc Ponty, on electric violin and you wind up with one hell of a rockin' record.  If you haven't already done so, check out &quot;Susie&quot; - one of my all-time favorite Elton songs - which just exudes funk.  Ponty's electric violin solo on &quot;Mellow&quot; is also something you don't want to miss. Finally, &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; and &quot;Don't Shoot Me&quot; are the only two records I've had on vinyl, 8-track, cassette, and CD.  What better recommendation could I give?
0345409671|5.0|Good book, Anne Rice told her views of what Heavan and Hell is, it convinced me, except the whole Memnoch trying to get Lestat on his side. But the rest of it could be true. Although, I dont really understand the end, was Memnoch just trying to get Lestat to bring Veronica's Veil to Earth so everyone would see it and witness a miracle? I don't know... For some reason it reminded me of The Passion of the Christ movie(that one part anyway). Hm...The beginning and end was good, the middle went by slowly.
B000099T2L|1.0|I am suffering from a SEVERE case of insomnia, so I decided to write a review.  I give this cd 1 star in order to represent the ONE song that I like.  And in order to give you an even clearer idea of what I think about this cd, I saved it to my Real Player on my laptop and ended up deleting the majority of the songs!!! I gave a &quot;soapbox&quot; review of Beyonce a while back, but now I am ready to say what I think of the cd. <br />1.Crazy In Love - (featuring Jay-Z)---most ANNOYING song of the summer!!!  Gosh, hearing this song on the radio while driving is NOT a good thing.  Wasn't feeling the Bonnie &amp; Clyde song, so it's no surprise to me that I feel the same way about this one.  And if I see ONE more person do that rumpshakin' dance...This song doesn't get as much airplay, but when that rare occasion rears it's ugly head, it is not a good thing. <br />2.Naughty Girl---I have NO clue as to what this song sounds like<br />3.Baby Boy - (featuring Sean Paul)---another overplayed song.  Granted, I do like this better than Crazy in Love, but it still isn't hot.  Just an example of taking a concept that's hot at the moment (Sean Paul) and running it into the ground. <br />4.Hip Hop Star - (featuring Big Boi/Sleepy Brown)---the first time I heard this song, I was in my friend's car and I promise  you  I couldn't even hear the words.  All I was thinking was &quot;what is this annoying crap ?(cuz I don't curse, lol)&quot; This song drags on and on<br />5.Be With You--Is this the one that sounds like that Bow Wow song?<br />6.Me, Myself And I--I liked this song when it first came out, but then it fell victim to too much airplay.   And then it died a painful death with me with the video!!  That video COMPLETELY ruined this song for me.  If it is on Midnight Love, I cannot face the tv.  Yes, in order to appreciate the song, I have to not be looking at Beyonce flailing about with a bad wig and that awful green dress and black dress beating up that guy (which is SO obviously assault). <br />7.Yes---THIS IS THE ONLY SONG ON THE CD I LIKE!!!!  Yes is an ok song.  Not really sure what she said &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; too, but I guess it can mean a variety of things.  The lyrics are ok, but typical.  Again, the only song I like. <br />8.Signs - (featuring Missy Elliott)--filler..that whole speaking in tongues thing is horrible<br />9.Speechless--can't listen to this<br />10.That's How You Like It - (featuring Jay-Z)---&quot;That's how you like it, huh?&quot;  Do they even say anything else in this song?<br />11.Closer I Get To You, The - (with Luther Vandross)--She's way too young to be singing this song with Luther.  I don't hear any vocal chemistry between the two of them. That is my opinion, and I am sticking to it.  Listening to this song leaves me very uneasy. <br />12.Dangerously In Love 2--This song was ok until my friend informed me that this is a DC song that she took and didn't even really remake.  This song is obviously filler. <br />13.Beyonce Interlude--never listened to it. <br />14.Gift From Virgo---never listened to it. <br />15.Daddy - (hidden track)---CREEPS ME THE HECK OUT!!!<br />OK, this is my review.  I actually got this cd over Christmas.  I burned a copy from my best friend's BURNED copy, LOL.  This cd is easily forgettable and I don't expect her sophomore effort to be any better (worse?).  Don't believe The Hype.  If you do fall victim to The Hype, get &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys.&quot;<br />Which brings me to my final point:  How in the HEEZY is a tour with B, A Keys, and Missy E gonna work?  3 different artists.  I know, me personally, I would only go to see Alicia.  And even then, I probably wouldn't buy a ticket b/c I don't want to see Missy and B.  Beyonce's cd is full of filler slow songs that all sound alike, so I'm wondering what her stage show will be like. I wouldn't be surprised if she sang a bunch of DC songs.  <br />OK OK OK, last point: Did anybody really expect her to NOT win at theGrammy's?  The Grammy's are a joke, and this is proven by the sheer fact that that ignoramus 50 Cent was even nominated.  <br />OK, I'm done.  Either skip this cd or burn it!!!

B000003CMC|5.0|Much of Eat a Peach was recorded after the death of Duane Allman and the rest were the recordings of sessions taped just before his death. Part tribute, listening to Eat a Peach thirty years later it's amazing to hear what a fantastic band this original line-up of the Allman Brothers was.<br />Like most of the early albums, Eat a Peach transcends the &quot;Southern Rock&quot; label and can be appreciated for what it is: great music played by an excellent group of musicians. Dickey Betts is surprisingly great, stepping up to the plate with almost effortless playing. Great songs abound here. Even Mountain Jam [which at 33 minutes might have been a tedious affair] flies by with ease, containing a number of unforgettable instrumental solos.<br />Eat a Peach belongs with every rock lover's collection. A great album that serves to highlight just how much we lost when Duane Allman passed away.
B00007ELEL|5.0|This movie is by far the funniest movie I have ever seen next to the classic hockey movie &quot;Slap Shot&quot;.THIS MOVIE DEFFINATLY NEEDS A SEQUEL!!I heard the Cohen Bros. once said they don't do sequels but I highly pray they reconsider on this one. This movie had all the chemistry and acting one could ask for in a comedy. The Cohen Brothers with John Goodman &amp; Jeff Bridges have created a movie comedy that blows away anything Cheech &amp; Chong could have ever dreamed of making.The enitire pace of this movie is perfect in everyway. The story, the acting, especially the characters, the non stop comedy, the brilliant filming and soundtrack makes this movie my favorite of all time.I cannot think of a better constructed brilliantly acted &amp; casted movie for everything this movie portrays. The classic one liners in this movie make it unforgetable.In my opinion the Cohens have created a classic. The Choens should highly think about a sequel to this one. Not a huge success at the box office and not admired as much by critics of &quot;Fargo&quot;, this one was truley the Cohens best by far and a classic missed by many.THE DVD FEATURES on this one are great. The picture quality is top notch and the surround sound is great for the soundtrack.I highly reccommend this movie to anyone besides old ladys that don't like movies  with alot (what I'll call) &quot;properly placed&quot; foul language that fits the movie in every way.I am not a fan of continuous foul language but this movie atleast uses it constructively and uses it properly to fit the scenes and comic mood and pace.Of I had to decscibe this movie I would call it a Cheech &amp; Chong meets Sienfeld. The Seinfeld part because in all reality this moive is about nothing. Not taking away from the other excellent reviewer that said the story was about The Dude (Jeff Bridges) who is put into a situation to become a Phillip Marlow/Chong detective. There is story in this perfect comedy movie. The characters and actingoutshine in everyway! Their story is ironic and much about nothing. This is what makes it so funny and entertaining in my opinion.You &quot;Leboswski&quot;fans out there that have seen this movie, deffinatly go rent or buy the classic Paul Newman movie &quot;Slap Shot&quot; for the same entertainment.Those that are fans of &quot;Slap Shot&quot;, and even fans of Cheech &amp; Chong, then you MUST SEE BIG LEBOWSKI!!!~The Dude Abides
B00000DGSN|5.0|Live in Japan is the album of a band at the height of its powers in the early '70s. Blackmore's guitar and Lord's keyboard dominate the album, which was recorede as part of their support for the then newly released \\"Machine Head\\" LP. One thing to notice is the \\"politeness\\" of the Japanese crowd. Unlike American or European audiences, they hesitate to cheer during the quieter interludes after instrumental solos. Perhaps the only drawbacks are the weak bass line in the remastered version and the overlong drum solo which is really reflective of the era it was recorded.<br />Rhino has done a great job (as usual) with its remastering. The instruments are crisp and overall sound is a stunner. From the opening notes of \\"Highway Star\\" to \\"Space Truckin'\\" the band was smokin' during their Japanese tour. The bonus cd is a great extra.<br />This important and influential album should be in any serious rock music lover's collection. Get the Rhino remastered if you can. Highly recommeded!
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I was very pleased with how this movie turned out (except the whole Bill situation could have been taken out. it didn't really match her ideals really..). When I saw previews for it, I knew at once I wanted to see it but was afraid Hollywood would ruin it. On the contrary, I was very moved.<br />I was really impressed how they addressed what is expected from all women, but also how all women are DIFFERENT. On one hand, there is Katherine Watson who believes women should not simply get married and have children, that there is \\"more to life\\" than motherhood.  On the other hand, there is the university and most of its faculty and students who believe the opposite. And then there are the very few (or maybe one) in between who believe in possibilities... Though the character Katherine Watson has a noble agenda to change the rigid motherly ideals of the school, she has simply fled to the opposite extreme with rigid academic ideals.<br />Though this movie takes place in the 1950's, these themes are NOT irrelevent. Take it from a college girl herself (and many of my friends) - many of these expectations and pressures still exist in different forms. Replace Katherine with your high school, your peers, and your parents, and replace the Wellesley of the 1950s with your grandmothers, your aunts, your friends and you have MY life with a seemingly opposite but very similar struggle.<br />Therefore, I give this movie 5 stars. It realistically depicts the struggle that can still be seen in many women's lives today, but does not provide a cop-out answer for the masses. Like the analogy in the film of the paint-by-number sets, women are not cookie cutter shapes!<br />All the actresses in this movie did a wonderful job. Julia Stiles, Julia Roberts, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and more.. I was easily able to relate to these characters, and their development is exceptionally interesting. This film holds much significance to those of us women who have lived it out in one way or another.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|Peter Gabriel's new 2-Disc compilation, simply titled &quot;Hit,&quot; is certainly a better picture of Gabriel's career than was his previous collection, &quot;Shaking the Tree.&quot;  &quot;Hit&quot; contains more of what I would consider to be essential Gabriel songs, including one that was previously left out, the popular &quot;In Your Eyes.&quot;  I was glad to see that song on this collection.<br />Many of Gabriel's standard pop hits are to be found on the first CD of the collection. Many of these are songs the made Gabriel famous as a &quot;solo&quot; musician, including &quot;Solsbury Hill,&quot; &quot;Sledgehammer,&quot; &quot;Shock the Monkey,&quot; and &quot;Digging in the Dirt.&quot;  Disc 1, also subtitled &quot;Hit,&quot; is where you'll hear the songs that you probably already know and love. It finishes with one of my favorite Gabriel songs, &quot;Here Comes the Flood.&quot;<br />Disc 2, subtitled &quot;Miss,&quot; contains some of the lesser-known Gabriel material (though &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; is included here, and seems a bit out of place). It includes &quot;The Rhythm of the Heat,&quot; &quot;I Greive&quot; (which was first heard on the &quot;City of Angels&quot; soundtrack), &quot;Lovetown&quot; (first heard on the soundtrack for &quot;Philadelphia&quot;), and &quot;Family Snapshot.&quot;  The real gem on this CD, however, is the live recording of &quot;Downside Up&quot; in which Gabriel sings accompanying his daughter, Melanie. This track, near the end of Disc 2, was a wonderful surprise. It's almost worth the price of the collection all by itself, though the rest of songs found on the two CD's are excellent as well.<br />Sound reproduction on both discs is crystal clear -- I really couldn't ask for a better-produced recording than this. In some cases (&quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; for example), I had grown so used to hearing the somewhat muddy original recordings that hearing them remastered and sharp was like hearing them for the first time again.<br />This is a collection, of course, and the nature of the beast will be to leave out some peoples' favorite songs. Especially when you consider that Gabriel has so many good songs available to choose from, it becomes hard to imagine a collection which could include all of them. I am no exception to this rule, and in my case I would have loved to hear two of my other favorite Gabriel songs, &quot;Secret World&quot; and &quot;Mercy Street,&quot; also included on this collection. Sadly, they are absent, but the collection doesn't suffer for it.<br />Also missing are any tracks from what may be Gabriel's masterpiece, &quot;Passion,&quot; his score for Martin Scorsese's &quot;Last Temptation of Christ.&quot; I can see the rationale behind not including these, especially since &quot;Passion&quot; is strongest as a whole piece. Putting individual tracks from &quot;Passion&quot; onto &quot;Hit&quot; would have done little to show listeners the power of that album as a whole. Better, I think, to let listeners experience &quot;Passion&quot; as it is meant to be experienced: as a whole piece in its entirety.<br />Overall, &quot;Hit&quot; is a more complete collection than &quot;Shaking the Tree,&quot; and it is a better-produced one as well. &quot;Hit&quot; really highlights many of the best points in Gabriel's career, both from the standpoint of popular success and creative achievement. It shows why Gabriel is still considered one of the most talented and groundbreaking artists still working in the field of popular music.<br />If you're going to own a Peter Gabriel collection, this is the one to own.n.<br />This is a collection, of course, and the nature of the beast will be to leave out some peoples' favorite songs.

B00004W52U|5.0|This is a great CD indeed, if you like this check out Last Wave Rockers by Common Rider, Jesse Michael's newest band. It has less punk, more ska, but I think its even better than this.<br />However ill talk a bit more about this CD, I agree the recording isnt the BEST but its not bad and it gives a great raw feelings to it, thats a good thing! Keep in mind they were only 18/19 years old when they made this, Jesse was a true musical genius back then and even more so now!<br />Bottom line: If you are a rancid fan or any ska or punk fan you NEED this CD!!

The story is wonderfully good and the characters are superb.     To anyone out there who has never read Science Fiction and is thinking about it. Enders Game is where you should start.
B00009L1UP|4.0|The first time I heard this cd, I seriously wanted to puke all over it, and chuck it out the window. And im not exaggerating.<BR>But after listening to it a few times, I can safely say that this is a solid disc, packed with great songs. <BR>The opening few songs are a bit rough (IMO) but it gets really good around song 3. <br />The bonus songs are nice, I really liek Last Time In Paris.<br />Anyway, Id give it a 5/5 if it wasnt for the opening songs.<BR>Still, go out and check this out, though it might take a few listens to really get into.
0385510438|1.0|This is the by far the worst book I have ever purchased.  I would love to have my money back.  What was John Grisham thinking about, when he wrote this?   Obviously, he wasn't thinking.  I have read everyone of his books, and if the rest of them are going to be like this, I will have to pass.  I am an avid reader of John's; I am the one that can't wait until his next book comes out.  I will have to wait next time, because I won't ever read another one like this!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000005IU2|5.0|First of all I'd like to say that there is no such thing as good music and there is no such thing as bad music.  There is simply music one likes and music one dislikes.  Some of us who have had our anti-mainstream noses in the air too long fail to realize what music is really about.<BR>That being said, I'd like to say that Fun House is what really got me back into the Stooges after I was bitterly disappointed with the eardrum shredding second half of Raw Power, which was my first Stooges album.<br />As soon as Down on the Street came blasting out of my speakers I knew I had picked up something special.  It was primitive.  It was funky. It was rock and roll. The next two tracks didn't disappoint me either.  Loose reminds me of a sped up Smoke on the Water for some reason, but I still love it.  And then of course, there is the snarling riff of TV Eye, a song that I think I would use to introduce rock music to someone who had never heard it before.<BR>My personal favorite is Dirt though.  The Stooges go all psychedelic and even whip out the wah pedals for a bit.  The end result is a really beautiful piece of music that sounds like Iggy Pop assassinated Janis Joplin so he could sing for Big Brother and the Holding Company.<BR>I consider &quot;Dirt&quot; the climax of the record, but it doesn't mean I don't appreciate the last three songs.  The saxophone keeps the album from getting boring (not that it would otherwise) and the groovy beats keep coming.  LA Blues sounds to me like the ending of a song stretched out for five minutes, but I still listen to it when I don't have a headache.<BR>Critics seem to like to call this album &quot;dumb&quot; but I never got that impression.  It just seemed like good ol' fun rock and roll to me.
B000002L3P|1.0|Ever heard of a band called Pearl Jam.......they have a song called &quot;yellow ledbetter&quot; in which kenny wayne shepherd ripped off and called &quot;while we cry&quot;...and then starts the song by saying its an instrumental HE wrote.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|First off, I'll start out with the obligitory fair warning: You'll hear Franz compared to almost every band that has had some success in the past 2 years...everyone from The Strokes to Interpol and beyond.<BR>Truth is, although Franz Ferdinand pays an agreeable nod to a few bands that have come before them, they have developed their own unique sound and comparisons will undoubtedly fall short. The best way to judge would be for you to see what kinds of music I really like. If you like these bands too, you'll thank me for suggesting Franz Ferdinand.<BR>I'm kind of bummed that the album finally came out in the states...I imported a copy after hearing a download from the bands website a few months back. Here's to hoping that the band doesn't attract so much attention that their reputation preceeds their musical prowess.<BR>I love the Smiths, first and foremost...I think they're one of the best bands that ever came together to record music. I like The Cure. I like Gang of Four, Neutral Milk Hotel and My Bloody Valentine. In recent years, I like Interpol. And I like The Rapture and even Hot Hot Heat. <BR>The boys from FF hail from Glasgow, a town that has brought us the creative and musical genius that is Belle and Sebastian. I don't know what's in the water over there, but I'm considering importing some of it.<BR>Franz Ferdinand come out on their debut album as  a group of artists formed not for the sole purpose of creating music, but creating an atmosphere and a feeling. Fortunately for us, the guys just happen to be top-notch musicians and they've put together some of the best songs to come out in the past 6 years. Poppy? Some of it, yes...but not questionably so. Amazing bass lines, great high hat attacks and solid rhythm guitar lay down the backdrop for a painting that could only be completed by a soulfull, solid voice.<BR>There will be the inevitible comparisons to Pulp, Interpol, Joy Division, etc. but none of them really fit the bill. This album has an overall feeling of coming from The Smiths' era, but not necessarliy a retro feel. Just as everything adds up to be more than the simple sum of its' parts, Franz Ferdinand is a unique combination of artists and musicians that seem to have come together for the perfect approach to inspired, clever lyrics and an original sound. That's right..I said it: orginal. Every band is influenced by other bands...it's how they take that inspiration and use it to their own advantage that sets bands miles apart. These guys are for real...and if you're a fan of good music that entirely eclipses what you hear on the radio in this day and age, pick it up and then email me for an address so that you can send me a Thank You card. Pick it up now before they end up on the cover of Rolling Stone as the band slated to save Rock and Roll. Then you can laugh at people who start to listen to them in July and say, 'My boys from Glasgow! I've been listening to them for like, forever!' Either way, get it now, get it later....just pick it up and decide for yourself whether art influences music or if it's the othe way around.
B000002H97|5.0|Once upon a time there was a band called Metallica, and they were the best band.<br />Before the debacles Load and Re-Load, there was an album with no name, and it was the best album.<br />This album marks the point in time when Metallica struck the perfect chord between garage band rock, and refined art.  Cleaner than \\"... And Justice For All\\" and \\"Kill 'em All\\" but not as over-refined as \\"Load\\" and \\"Re-Load\\", the Black Album was the pinnacle of the greatest rock band ever.  This album perfectly encapsulates the despair and anger of the classic rock band.  The sounds are amazing, especially now when music, amazingly, has evolved into an industry of sex appeal rather than audial satisfaction.<br />Once upon a time, before MTV raped the music industry, musicians made music.  And this was the best music.
B0001611DI|4.0|This film was one of those movies that, when your really young screws up your mind and haunts you for a long time (in my case, my whole childhood!)It's almost impossible to get that with a horror movie today..not even the new &quot;DAWN OF THE DEAD&quot; playing in theatres now, which is good but in no way as creepy as the original.<br />This film has all the elements of a great horror flick; great direction, great acting, great makeup, and a creepy soundtrack.<br />Of course, younger audiences will probably not enjoy this movie because of the all the films out there these days with their special effects and big name actors, and huge budgets but if you wanna go &quot;old school horror&quot;..check this out!<br />I mean, this film has to be good..they made a remake!
B00006V9A0|5.0|A collection of the greatest hits from a great band.  Best if you buy all their CDs instead, buy this CD if nothing else though.  Almost every track is a classic, what a shame Kurt died and left his wife to run around naked on late night talk shows and getting arrested and more importantly leaving the music industry to other such bimbos and talentless sex symbols.<br />I dream of a time when music was about . . . the music.
B0000027RL|5.0|In school, there are certain &quot;required readings&quot; that the education system enforces on children because we all know that otherwise kids will grow up reading brainless novels.<br />Well, our kids are growing up listening to brainless trash that I will not even give the dignity of calling music.  Therefore, it's time to teach these dumb high schoolers that, like in literature, the greatest music has to offer is by far the crap that your friends are listening to.  The horrendously swift rise of the punk-pop genre, marked by the decline and transformation of Blink 182 into a band for high school girls needs to be stemmed, and this album can do it.<br />If only the world knew that once upon a time, we listened to music that was . . . good.<br />The best album from the best band to survive the 90s.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Manson should impress anyone with this solid album.  It shows great growth in Manson's music and lyrically, it's Manson's best.  If only people would look past his exterior and look into his music, it's changed my life.  One of the best performers/vocalists and lyricist of the 90s and he's still putting out CDs.  The title track 'Mechanical Animals' is brilliant with lines such as 'I was a hand grenade that never stopped exploding'.  'I Don't Like The Drugs (But The Drugs Like Me)' is almost anthem like.  A MUST for any hard rock fan and I recommend people look deeper into Manson's music before judging him.  It's truly an album for the decade.
B000000HRP|5.0|i command you again to get this album NOW!!!!!!!
B000000WF0|5.0|This was a great cd! It made me want to listen to it everyday!
B000000OU0|5.0|The Eagles almost full length live album is pure brilliance.  The four first tracks are new and 'Get Over It' is a fast paced masterpiece.  My favourite song on this album would have to be 'New York Minute' but the Eagles prove they KNOW how to put on a live show.  Their live versions of 'Tequila Sunrise', 'Hotel California', 'Take It Easy' and 'In The City' are fantastic.  One of the best albums ever to grace my CD collection.
630280082X|4.0|I very much enjoyed this movie. I love anything about the guitar. I wouldn't call this movie a cinematic triumph, but I would say that guitar fans and blues fans would find it it enjoyable. The scenes with Steve Vai I amazing. I think regardless of the genre you play on the guitar, Steve Vai is an icon to any guitarist. My only complaint was that we didn't get to see as much classical guitar. I myself am a classical guitar admirer and was a bit dissappointed that we didn't get to hear as much of William Kanengiser's beautiful playing. Bill Kanengiser is the guitarist who played the classical guitar for Ralph Macchio. I consider him to be one of the best classical guitarists today. Ry Cooder's slide playing is brilliant also. This movie may not impress those apathetic to the guitar or music in general, but guitarists and admirers of the guitar will find this movie to be worth while
B00005JMCW|5.0|This movie was completely hilarious and a total shock to me.  I wasn't going to give it a chance because I don't usually like &quot;teen&quot; movies but Lindsay Lohan has proven to me that she is a genuine actress.  The reason I watched it because I love Jamie Lee Curtis but it was Lindsay who stole the show for me (though Curtis played a very significant, funny role).  Most of you know the storyline, the two get switched and have to play in each other's lives for a day.  It's actually really funny, don't throw the opportunity away like I was going to.  Lohan is one of the only teen actresses who stands a chance because she can actually act and she's gorgeous as hell.  'Freaky Friday' is a must see for anybody.
0694518018|5.0|This is a must read for any person serious about investing (ie not gambling) in the stock market. The book is rather easy to read. Graham was an investor but also a teacher (at Columbia). He has a good balance between technical yet simple explanation. If you know absolutely nothing about the stock market and financials, you may still find it a bit obscure at time, but you should probably not invest directly anyway (at least not right away). For everyone else, read it.<BR>Yes the latest edition was written in 1972. It is amusing at time to see the evolution. But actually this evolution is also part of what you learn by reading the book. You do see that some things never change (like valuing a company!), and others do change quite a bit. it gives you a nice perspective. Now  the intersting part of the book is to understand the logic of Graham, less its conclusions. The conclusions date a bit. Graham used to work at a time when most corporations where industrial companies, when nowadays services are dominant for example. So take graham conclucions with a grain of salt. But do read in depth and try to understand his logic.<BR>Value investing won't make you rich overnight. But reasonnably well done, it will avoid having you lose money, and can even open you the doors of year by year over-performance in the market. Warren Buffett and several other successfull investors have followed the approach of Graham. But as they all say, when you first read about value investing, you either understand it right away, or you never will. But trust my 15 year of investing on the stock market, you're better of understanding the value of value investing. And this book is the key to it.
B000002MY3|5.0|This album is an anthem to female rockers everywhere.  Alanis' poetic mind and creative sound mixing is incredible.  Angry, honest and unapologetic, I think Alanis deserves two giant thumbs up.  This is the album of the 90s and I am glad I've had the pleasure of listening to her music for all these years.
0920668372|1.0|My initial reaction to reading this book, the night of my baby shower, is 'what were they THINKING???' -- both the author and my girlfriend who gave this to me.  There are other ways to show your love as a mother to your grown child rather than driving across town, using a LADDER no less to then SNEAK into your grown son's window to then rock him and sing to him.  I'm sorry folks, but those of you who say this is okay are fooling yourselves.  This is inappropriate, to say the very least, and doesn't belong in a children's book.  The concept could have easily been presented in another manner and the book's message remain intact.  Additionally, I dare to say that the issue of a parent's death is definitely not one I'd like to present to my daughter before bedtime.  I disliked this book so much it went into the trash.  There's too many wonderful children's books out there that present parents' unconditional love for their children without this weirdness.
B000002AZ8|5.0|I absolutely adore this album.  It's easy to say why: it's Pearl Jam, Eddie Vedder is a musical genius, guitar work is great and the lyrics are some of Pearl Jam's best yet.  'Vitalogy' was Pearl Jam's step into experiementing.  The album features many slow songs including 'Nothingman', 'Better Man' and 'Immortality' and songs with meaningful lyrics, 'Corduroy', 'Whipping' and 'Tremor Christ'.  I don't know how any rock fan could not like this album.  Though this album contains a lot of useless songs such as 'Pry To', 'Bugs', 'Aye Davanita' and 'Hey Foxymop...' (which by the way is Pearl Jam's worst song), they are overshadowed by the brilliance of the other songs.  If it weren't for those &quot;experiemental&quot; songs, this would be my favourite Pearl Jam cd.  Nobody compares to Pearl Jam and this is them at their best.
B000002UB3|5.0|What more can I say? The Beatles in my own opinion are the greatest group of all time. And this album. Oh my gosh. It's wonderful<br />&quot;Come Together&quot;- Most people don't understand this song. It's about this LSD seller that John and Yoko met who was going to run for office with the campaign &quot;Come Together&quot;. Lots view these lyrics as nonsense when they do all mean something. They all decribe him. (these are just a few obvious examples)<BR>&quot;..he one holy roller&quot;-He's very highly religious.<BR>&quot;..he one spinal cracker&quot;-Employees used to call there bosses &quot;spinal crackers&quot; :bending them backyard to do something<BR>&quot;...he one roller coaster&quot;Up and downs /Manic depression<BR>&quot;..he got early warning&quot;-Bad breath<BR>&quot;...he got muddy water&quot;-Mixed emotions<BR>see?<br />&quot;Something&quot; Such a sweet melody. I especially like middlish part &quot;your asking me will my love grow&quot; Harrison sings this song very well and captures hearts. It changes subtley throughout the song<br />&quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; - This song always makes me giggle everytime I hear it. It's satire at it's best. It makes murder humble and amusing. Especially when Paul misses a note and laughs. Quite an excellent song<br />&quot;Oh! Darling&quot;- A sing along song. A pleading song. Very nice to listen to when you don't really want a lot of rocking noise<br />&quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;-Oh ringo. Such a clever catchy song that reminds me of when I was younger. It's nonsense and it's fabulous.<br />&quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot;- Most people don't like this song because it's got so few lyrics. I think it's brilliant. I mean there are plenty of songs out there with 120 different lines that are all meaningless. The Beatles took 3 lines and made them mean everything. Thats why they were so great<br />&quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;- I always liked this song. It's a wholesome favorite but lately I have heard it so much that it's rather the same. But it's the Beatles in there Zenish happy little mode. Wonderful<br />&quot;Because&quot;-Such good harmony and meldoy. The synthezire(sp?) is very dark a deep but the song stays true to love. People may wonder about the lyrics. Don't. John Lennon said &quot;there actaully as they say. nothing else&quot;<br />&quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;- This is such a pretty song in the begining and then turns into a steady upbeat classic. It makes me want to sing out loud. Quite a masterpiece.<br />&quot;Sun King&quot;- I especially like the beat and bass in this. Creative lyrics. I really thing it's a very enjoyable song<br />&quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;-This is one GREAT song. it makes me want to get up and dance and it sounds like NOTHING the Beatles have ever made. MMm classic.<br />&quot;Polythene Pam&quot; - Funny, catchy, and a great continuing version of Mean mr. Mustard.<br />&quot;She Came In Through The Bathroom Window&quot;-This is one of my favorite Beatles songs. I actually like it better without all the riff raff in the background like it is on the Anthology. Goodness<br />&quot;Golden Slumbers/Carry that Weight&quot;- I knwo these are two different songs but through my whole life I just remeber/hear them as one. It's such a great song with beatuiful lyrics and a lullaby beat. I first heard it when I was 3 on a tape my dad made me (or so he tells me). So I guess I've always liked it's pure genius<br />&quot;The End&quot;- I really do like this song, many don't but that's their opinion and I hope it's not yours. It's a great wrap up song.<br />&quot;Her Majesty&quot;-I think it's an odd/short song, but it's typical Beatles. I can't really say much about it since there isn't buch to it. I like it though. I like it a lot.<br />-Hope that helped. Beatles. Forever-<br />Lindsay
B0000B3FCX|1.0|If you want to blow chucks for over 60 minutes, get this album.  Crappy modern-rock with a cocky lead singer who can't sing if he had to save his life.  This is an insult to rock music.  I shudder at the thought that this is not their first album ... ugh, and we all though Creed was bad...this is by far the worst rock band ever.  Save your money and buy a CD worth while like Pearl Jam's 'Ten' or Soundgarden's 'Superunknown' because this is garbage.
B00005JMGC|1.0|I went to a women's college in New England in the 1950s. Any resemblance between that reality and the portrayal in the movie appears to be purely accidental. The movie makers showed little knowledge of the period, apparently confusing the 1950s with the 1920s, and no knowledge of young women, women's education, or women's colleges at that time. The film is a collection of wall-to-wall, highly erroneous cliches and stereotypes (these colleges as finishing schools, which they definitely were not, intellectually impoverished, authoritarian--I could go on and on). <br />OUCH!!!
0812550706|5.0|I am not into Science Fiction myself but I was able to read this book and I am sorry that that book is over.  What I liked about the book the most is the developing of the characters.  You get really attaced to the people in this book and caught into what is happening to Ender.  You must read it if you are a Science Fiction fan but if you are not you should pick it up and give it a try.
0060931671|4.0|Pynchon lets the threads dandle in this oblique satire of suburban sprawl, conspiracy theories, and sixties hipness.  Oedipa Maas, wife of Mucho, sleuths her way to uncertainty.  She's cold on the trail of a shadowy organization called the Tristero that competes for the postal trade and uses a muted trumpet as its symbol.  Who knew that Miles Davis was part of a worldwide mail delivery feud?  A cat with no shortage of curiosity, Oedipa fumbles into some memorable, slightly perverse encounters.  She flees the clutches of a randy esoteric, witnesses the breakdown of her psychiatrist, and meets The Paranoids, faux mop tops who write songs about frugging.  The more Oedipa learns about the Tristero the less she knows; further, she cannot dismiss the possibility that she's the victim of an elaborate practical joke.<br />In one overly long stretch of this short post-modernist novel Pynchon indulges in some sanguinary Jacobean drama.  More satisfying is his description of southern California: several decades before Orange County morphs into a diorama of the body snatched, Pynchon anticipates the dislocating effect of exit ramps, strip malls, and those fathomless planned communities that are everywhere and nowhere.  The search for order and meaning, the novel implies, ultimately leads to frustration, to some realization that the universe is chaotic, even random.  Pynchon is all head, no heart.  His other novels are maddeningly inaccessible, which of course makes them a kind of template for the current crop of young wise-acre American writers who favor clever gimmicks and shun human feeling.
0451529065|5.0|Besides natural selection, Darwin in this book laid the groundwork for ecology (doesn't use that term), and the scientific study of animal behavior. One other point which often gets overlooked is that if you can get past the Victorian prose style you will see a nearly flawless model of how to patiently build a complex argument out of a mass of raw data. The way Darwin himself brings up objections to his ideas, treats them carefully and respectfully, and then disposes of them is an example to everyone who has to deal in complex, controversial ideas. This book is one of the high water marks of the human mind.
B00005JN02|4.0|I heartily recommend \\"Good Bye Lenin\\". It has been a \\"major\\" movie in Germany. It has ushered in an era of \\"Ostologie\\" or nostalgia for the old days before the wall fell - when life was simpler than in the capitalistic west.<br />On a superficial level the movie could also be viewed as a yearning for the \\"good old days\\" of communism. I see a deeper, more important message in the film. It has do do with truth and how communism is an enemy of truth.<br />Communist rulers always believed that they knew better than the common people. They felt it was their duty to shape the actions of the common people toward more worthwhile goals. They felt so strongly about it that they were willing to distort the truth, and even use threats of and actual physical violence to get their way.<br />The main character, Alex, was raised under this system. He is a very loving son. But has he unconsciously picked up these same communist beliefs?<br />Alex's behavior in trying to \\"protect\\" his mother from the truth is very similar to the actions of communist/totalitarian governments which control the media in order to propagandize the citizens and \\"protect\\" them from what the ruling elites decide is not good for them.<br />At the dacha Alex's mother confesses that she has lied to her children for all those years, again to \\"protect\\" them from the truth. But in her confession she admits that this has been a great dis-service to them. She did it because of her own weakness and FEAR of retribution from the government. Somehow Alex never seems to get this message. Is it because his communist upbringing has blinded him to the importance of truth? Does he think that truth is only relative? Is he acting toward his mother like the communist state acted towards its citizens?<br />Isn't this movie fundamentally about truth? And the importance of truth?
B00006G8G1|5.0|Ok so the camera angles are fast but this is IRON MAIDEN it creates a quick atmosphere fitted nicely with steve harris bass lines.

B000089RVX|3.0|Alright, let me begin by saying that if I had written this review a year ago or so, when I actually bought the CD, my review would have been very different. I would have praised the song writing and production and would have probably given it at least 4 stars. Now as time has passed I realize this CD is good, but could have been so much better.<br />Like most people, I first heard of this band through Bring Me to Life. I thought it was a decent song, but after listening to a couple of other songs (Hello and Haunted), I realized that the &quot;hit&quot; and the rest of the CD were very different. I started reading about the band and found out about Origin (their first CD) and some of their even earlier stuff. After downloading Origin (talk to their old record label about removing the record from print and selling the copies on ebay for 100s of dollars), I found out what this band was really about. They weren't some loud hard-rock band, but were a varied band that wrote beautiful, Christian mustic. As an aside, anyone who denies that this is &quot;Christian Rock&quot; needs to listen to Hello, &quot;I'm the light living for you...&quot; come on. It's fine that they're Christian, but at least have the guts to admit it.<br />Anyways, back to my review. As I listened to the old stuff, and then listened to the remakes on Fallen, I thought, why? My Immortal has NOTHING added to it by adding strings, and if I didn't know better I'd say that the vocal track and piano line are exact copies of the Origin version. The only song that has really improved is Whisper, which sounds like a brand new song. Granted the CD is massively over-produced, but that isn't necessarily a &quot;bad&quot; thing. The end of Haunted is outstanding, and the bridge in Whisper is a classic. <br />So after all this, we come back to the fact that this band has very much changed, but not for the better (especially with Ben now gone, but that's another story). I wish I could go back a couple of years and hear them play Exodus, or Understanding, or Lies live, but I can't, so this CD will have to do. So I give this three stars, not for what it is, but for what it could have been.
1576751988|5.0|Yes. The Muppet's Kermit the Frog sang one song titled &quot;It's not easy being green&quot;. After reading Brian Tracy's book, you'll be singing &quot;It's not easy to continue being a procrastinator now&quot;!<br />This book contains 21 wonderful chapters. Each chapter is like a different store in a Mall called the &quot;Action Now Mall&quot;. Some days you need something from a store. Some other day you need something from some other store. Well. Same thing happens with Mr. Tracy's book. Just keep it near yor personal workspace. And use it like that. Consult it and put it away. As many times as you need it. As many times as you would go to the Mall.<br />So, don't pay attention to other reviewers saying this book is a waste of money. This book is NOT a novel. It's not even intended to be read from start to finish in a single night. This books is like a reference text or a manual or an instruction booklet. YOU NEED THIS BOOK IF YOU REALLY REALLY WANT TO STOP PROCRASTINATING NOW. <br />Carlos Sicilia, Caracas, Venezuela
B00000DLV1|3.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I own this DVD and it one of the most beautiful concerts I've ever heard. Since Portishead is probably done, at least we have this CD to document their live shows. However, the glaring omission is the outstanding version of Roads on the DVD. It is the only song that gets a standing ovation, and is just breathtaking. Instead we get a version with a bunch of idiots clapping. I almost compare it to Street Spirit from Radiohead, Thom Yorke once said he couldn't believe people sang along and were happy when the song was played live, because it is such a melancholy song. Same goes here, great concert, poor choice of CDs. Do yourself a favor and buy the DVD.
B00005ASOC|3.0|The story is so played -- a ghetto genius is discovered, quite by accident, and is guided by a rough-around-the-edges genius-in-his-own-right mentor. You have seen this in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; or &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; among others.<br />Fortunately, Finding Forrester does have a somewhat different hue, and unlike the mawkish sentimentality of movies like Patch Adams or Bruce Almighty, it includes decent and well-contained drama.<br />It unfolds smoothly. So smoothly in fact that you don't really realize how many cardboard characters are smooshed in -- a spent-up reclusive J.D. Salinger type writer (Sean Connery), a failed writer with a grudge (the professor), a rich WASP student in a rich WASP school (the love interest of the black boy that never really takes off)..etc.<br />Besides, the movie's main premise hinges on a rather implausible chance meeting between a bunch of kids playing basketball and a Pulitzer winning writer who purportedly lives a hermit's life.<br />Yet, the script makes all the difference, it overshadows these minor quibbles. Very well written movie, tinged with modernistic poetry spoken and actuated with the least accents and efforts, more than enough to keep the spirit going.<br />Recommended rental.
B00008H2LB|3.0|this is a pretty good cd, but its over before it starts, 90% percent of the songs are in the 2 minute range, if they put more time into this it would be alot better
6305428352|2.0|Most of the reviewers on Amazon seemed to have loved this movie. They've said it made them cry, and think. This movie didn't provoke a tear from me.<br />I am not sure I'd attend classes that begin with rhetoric like 'What is music?' but Dreyfuss does a decent job of a quasi-inspiring teacher. Although this band master could be a little less mean when returning assignments.<br />The acting overall in the film is pretty plain though, and the somewhat interesting premise gets old real quick.<br />Some scenes are even borderline idiotic. First, our supposedly great teacher expects kids who don't know how to play their instruments to be playing Mozart after one day.<br />Then, there is a scene where he is teaching a girl how to play her clarinet. She has been playing the thing for 3 years but still can't get out a note. He tells her to think of the sunset, and suddenly she can play perfectly.<br />Corny. Very corny.  Dreyfuss is pretty much the only thing going for this one-time rental.
0385121679|5.0|I have to start this off by saying I am not a big Stephen King fan. That said, this book is nothing short of a masterpiece. The character of Jack Torrance is brilliantly revealed and expanded throughout the novel. Most of the people who gave this book a low rating probably wouldn't know a good book-or great one, for that matter-if it jumped up and bit them on the a$$. Most likely they see John Grisham(who i actually like) on the same level as Charles Dickens. What King does so wonderfully in this book is make his characters seem so real that you are able to connect with the emotional and physical pain they are put through. I recommend this book to anyone who says horror novels are not \\"real\\" literature.
0790729393|4.0|Making a movie of such a controversial account that is told in the stunning book (with the same name) must have been a daunting task, especially when you fill it with A-list movie stars, some of which are not known for their sentimental sides.<br />However, Levinson has created a masterpiece, and a film that everyone should watch. Sleepers might've not been the most eloquent courtroom drama, and the tactics used might be unrefined, but I absolutely loved it. It showed the consequences of prison guards' sadism, which affected the boys for the rest of their lives.<br />All the actors give mindblowing performances, with no conceivable weak link. This includes the four child actors, who dominate half of the movie, but obviously don't receive as much press as their older counterparts. These four kids were outstanding in roles that must have been truly harrowing to play, especially the young boy who played John. Even Brad Pitt shows that under the right direction he can be more than a candy face.<br />Add to this a great score from John Williams, and you will come back to this film time and time again. The DVD has great features too so in all a very worthy purchase.
0156421178|4.0|One of George Orwell's lesser known works, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is however, equally deserving of recognition as any other of his fine, fine writings. Shorter in length than most of his books (the memoir itself is approximately 190 pages long, with appendices taking up the remainder of the pages), it nonetheless paints a vivid picture of Orwell's experiences as a militiaman during the Spanish Civil War. Fighting against Franco's Fascists, Orwell left England to enlist in the radical and populist Republican militia. Unlike many in his militia unit, Orwell was not tied to any particular political persuasion in Spain, When asked why he had made the journey to Spain he replied simply \\"to fight Fascism\\", and when asked what he was fighting for he merely replied \\"common decency\\". Orwell left for Spain under the auspices of the ILP (Independent Labour Party), and as such, found himself among the ranks of the POUM militia. In actual fact, a point that Orwell appears to be at pains to repeat to his reader is his attempt at impartiality in his final assessment of his experiences. He denounces for example, the blatant lies and distortions of the Communist and pro-Communist press works just as he attacks the Fascist press with equal criticism (although he does exempt the Manchester Guardian from his wrath, which he commends for it's \\"honsest reporting\\"). Throughout the book, one gets a sense of Orwell's commitment to honesty.<br />Orwell's vivid, journalistic prose is perfect for capturing the human side of warfare and how the human spirit reacts to the immense stresses brought about by armed combat. Orwell himself however, did not experience combat on a regular basis, and a great deal of his observances of life at the front are filled with descriptions of conditions in the trenches, the attitudes of his fellow soldiers and the occasional peek above the trench in the hope of spotting a Fascist! The book is as much social commentary as it is war correspondance.<br />By far the most intriguing section of the book is Orwell's depiction of the cynical betrayal of the Republican militia by the Spanish Communist Party and it's agents. Having arrived in Spain, Orwell witnessed a Barcelona in a state of social revolution. Upon his return to the city after a stint at the front, he was witness to something very different. Under the order of the Spanish Communist Party (who in turn reported directly to Moscow, the Kremlin and Josef Stalin), Barcelona was the centerpiece of a dictatorial state within a state. Police and agents of the Communist Party turned their sights on members of all non-Communist militia units, be they radicals, populists or anarchists. Waves of arrests were followed in many cases by murders within the confines of Barcelona's frightful prsion cells (including that of Orwell's commander, Kopp, a Belgian). One can very easily see the beginnings of his later works of \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\" in these pages, where he denounces all Communist Parties as agents of Moscow and condemns their propaganda offensives against opponents of all kinds. It was Orwell's experiences in Spain that resulted in him making this now poignant statement:<br />\\"Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism as I understand it.\\"<br />In conclusion, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" should be read by any fan of Orwell, and as a prelude to \\"Anmal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\". My only criticism is that Orwell's use of abbreviations to describe the many political factions can leave the reader in a slight state of confusion. However, this should not detract from the merits of this book.
0380713802|4.0|I love Bill Bryson. I've read almost all his books, and each time I finish another one, I get a little sad thinking there are now fewer left for me to get to. He is that good.<br />&quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; is classic Bryson. This guy could write about paint drying and still make the funniest, smartest observations ever. Although all the giddy excitement of traveling to new places shines through in this memoir, most of the time Bryson talks about his experiences on trains, railway stations, police stations, waiting rooms, or hotel rooms by himself. Here is were his true talent shines through and he illuminates the absolutely wacky in the mundane.<br />I could have done without some of the misguided political commentaries he let slip in this book, but it is still a wonderful treat to see Europe through this mild-mannered madman's eyes. If you really want to laugh and laugh, go pick up this book--and all his other ones, too!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This show is wonderful! I love the relationship between Rory and Lorelai. And the idea of a small town (Stars Hollow, where they live) where everybody knows you, have a diner where you can eat at everyday, adn basically find a place where you can settle down in. I recommend watching the show and reading the books. (On Ft. Lewis it's on Tuesday at 8:00 PM on the WB, you might wanna check your TV guide for other times). When this DVD boxed set comes out, i promise it will be well- spent!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first heard about [i]Firefly[/i], I was doubtful. A western in space? What were they thinking? It didn't help that I wasn't a fan of Joss Whedon's previous shows, Buffy and Angel.<br />I wasn't immediately hooked, either, due to Fox's messing with the airing order. I liked it well enough to stick with it, but that was all.<br />I am very glad that I did; once I became acclimated to Whedon's nonstandard take on the future, I came to truely love the show. The characters are fantastic, the dialog crisp, and the acting is natural and true. Firefly is, quite simply, the best show of the new millenium so far, despite its short run.<br />There's a kind of critical mass to Firefly. Once you've seen a certain amount, even the episodes you weren't previously impressed with take on new dimensions, and you find new enjoyment in them. Therefore, I would encourage everyone to purchase this DVD, even if you weren't thrilled with the show while it was on. There's a good chance you'll love it anyway. (And even if you don't, you can give it to that relative whom you don't like very much, but are obligated to buy a present for!)
B000031X7T|5.0|This album just blew me away. Play it loud!! All the music comes through clear as a bell!! The vocals were excellent. The Piano was awsome, it was like I was there. The music was staged perfectly from the drums to the keyboards to the guitars and vocals.<br />I have the Jap remix and this album blows it out of the water.<br />I have a fairly 'hi-end' system which I'm sure helps.<br />Anyways I loved this one far better than the rest.<br />The book is great, a true keeper.<br />Buzz
B00006879E|3.0|I am a real record producer. My review of this:<br />Am I crazy or has this been done before and better by Jamiraquoi?<br />Maroon 5 are decent musicians, but its a total cop of Jamiraquoi!<br />Do yourself a favor, If you like this funk pop rock stuff, buy the Jamiraquoi records, they are better!
0380789019|2.0|Richard is an ordinary, do gooder who loves his comfortable life where nothing unexpected, unplanned, or unpleasant occurs.  But once he helps a girl from London below (another world that literally exists below the London Richard lives in) Richard finds that he is pulled in and no longer exists to anyone from his previous world.  Making it back is going to be hard, but surviving the trip is going to be nearly impossible.  And unfortunately he has teamed up with a group of people who each have their own agendas.  One wants revenge, one wants to kill a savage beast, and one wants to fufill a long standing debt.<BR>Gailman does get tremendous points for originality and imagination.  But for me anyway, that is all he gets.  I was disappointed with Neverwhere.  Gailman is supposedly close to Jonathan Carroll in his writings, but if you are going to read this book hoping for someone like Carroll, don't bother. <BR>I think the main problem with this book is that its premise is so fantastic, outrageous, and vivid that the characters and Gailman's writing style simply cannot measure up.  All of this is happening so fast to them and it is so fantastc that they cannot keep up.  <BR>And so the result is flat characters, flat dialogue, and a pretty flat writing style.  Gailman does not flow very well, and he is nowhere near the literary style of Jonathan Carroll.  The plot just seems to be forced on the characters, like they are just going through the motions and doing what Gailman wants them to do.  <BR>    The only redeeming thing about this book is Gailman's fantastic imagination.  The whole concept of this book and the effort it took to conjure up some of the outrageous images hints at his talent.  But that's about it.  It's a good concept, but as a writer Gailman cannot carry it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I believe the only people who are fortunate enough to 'get' this film are those who can identify with the characters.       I'm very fortunate. It's the best film I have ever seen.
B00003CXA4|5.0|There is nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said by previous reviewers - beyond excellence -<br />except<br />Gandhi said &quot;my life is my message&quot; - and the message of this film can change lives  - not many films can make that claim!
0061020680|5.0|&quot;Mort&quot; is Terry Pratchett's first truly great novel.  The gimmick, of course, is that Death is a main character in this book.  Growing tired of his job, he takes on a young boy named Mort as an apprentice.  The arrangement isn't perfect, however, as Mort still experiences emotions that are entirely foreign to Death.  This leads Death on a quest to gain understanding of the human concept of fun, while Mort runs into certain problems during his first attempt at the job.  The situations looks to be spiraling out of control, but everything comes together in an absolutely brilliant climax.<br />Like many folks, I've spent years listening to friends and critics hail Pratchett's genius nonstop.  I finally bowed to peer pressure and dove into his body of work, starting with &quot;The Color of Magic&quot;, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, and &quot;Equal Rites&quot;.  Now those are all fine books with lots of big laughs, but they didn't quite justify the endless claims of Pratchett being one of the great fantasy authors of all time.  &quot;Mort&quot; does.  The first two Discworld novels were straight-up farce, and &quot;Equal Rites&quot; seemed a bit uncomfortable with its serious themes.  &quot;Mort&quot;, however, shifts solidly into character-driven humor.  The jokes come not entirely from ludicrous diversions, but rather from watching the personalities in the story bounce off each other.  And through it all, Pratchett never forgets the subject matter that he's dealing with.  He makes good use of the concept of Death.<br />With that said, &quot;Mort&quot; is just plain hilarious.  I've remarked before how Pratchett has an almost unique gift for choosing words and sentences for maximum effect.  In this respect, he just gets better and better with each book.  One example from &quot;Mort&quot; that sticks out in my mind is a scene where Mort encounters three thugs in the streets of Ankh-Morpork.  First, the author is aware of and plays with formula fantasy conventions.  But more importantly, the way that he cuts between different perspectives while telling the story and constructs each sentence with care brings out maximum comic effect.  It's so brilliant, I could read twenty more of these novels.  Matter of fact, I think I will.
B0001AP12G|4.0|This Cd could've gotten the classic five stars, but I'm sorry, the interludes have got to go, On first listen I would've gave this cd a 3.

0783243499|5.0|Hello, I wanted to buy a movie for me and my husband to watch just for scares, so we did. We got three. The first one wasn't really entertaining nor was the second, but this one was. &quot;Americian Psycho&quot; was repeatedly rewinded over and over again, it was basically the best movie out there.<BR>     A rich man Patrick Baitman, in New York is a psycho killer because of these pills tat he takes, noone suspects that it's him because he has such a great reputation so he kills prostitutes, coworkers and some homeless people. His rich friends include, Timothy Bryce ( Justin Theroux ) and other co workers.<BR>     Him and his fiance are both having an affair with other people and they thik that the other doesn't know about it. Patrick never really proposed but his fiance has bought an engagment ring and is planning the weddin.g Patrick doesn't want to get married but doesn't leave his fiance until the end of the movie.<BR>     Patrick and his friends go clubbing, do drugs such as cocaine and steriods, but keeping in mind this movie is taking place in the 80's so they don't know about all the bad stuff yet.<BR>      I recommend this movie to everyone over the age of 21. Because this movie can be offensive to the younger viewers.
B000002LBH|5.0|I just bought this cd yesterday at a local music store and i have listened to the whole thing twice already. This is a classic. If you have ever read &quot;The Perks Of Being a Wallflower&quot; he mentions the song asleep, which is also my favorite song. Thats how i found out about the smiths anyways. In my opinion they are their own genre and i havent heard a band like them.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Earmarking a more experimental phase, Station to Station provides a more angular take on dance rhythms (most obvious on this album through the sublime funk bass of George Murray).  Preference herein was for a more chilly alienated mood, percolated through Bowie's heavily stylised vocals and increased use of electronica.<br />Bowie adopts a new persona, the Thin White Duke. This cold New European, forever restless, introduces the whole album on the title song. Station to Station is about the strains of the three-day train journey from New York to Los Angeles - all condensed into ten minutes of music. It begins with the sound of a train moving from speaker to speaker and ends as an all-out rocker. &quot;It's not the side effects of the cocaine - I'm thinking that it must be love&quot;, he tells us. Only the song's coldness and desperation prevents it from being as commercial as, say, Modern Love from his 1983 Let's Dance album. <br />The next song, Golden Years, was the album's only hit single. A melodic but restrained disco song with strong lyrics, it became the follow-up to to his US chart-topping song Fame. Legend has it that Bowie originally wrote the song for Elvis Presley, he reportedly rejected it. <br />Word On A Wing on the other hand, is a ballad about Bowie's restless searching - this time for God. Perhaps inspired by The Man Who Fell To Earth, refuge is found in the Lord and prayer. The song is literally heavenly with is choir-of-angels effect.<BR>  <BR>TVC 15, a bizarre, raunchy song inspired by a (supposedly drug-inspired) story Iggy Pop told Bowie - about how Iggy's girlfriend was swallowed by his TV set! <br />Stay is a smooth effort from the master. Running breathless on a funk groove, it continues on the &quot;it's too late...&quot; theme (&quot;Stay . . . or do something...&quot;). Carlos Alomar and Earl Slick get a chance to reveal their talent in the final (instrumental) two minutes of the song. <br />Wild Is The Wind is a cover of a song writtenfor a 1957 western starring Anna Magnani. The romantic mood of the song seems to have inspired Bowie, his singing is brittle and vulnerable. <br />This cd is a must for any genuine music lover.
B000002J1U|5.0|when people think of led zeppelin cds usually this one doesnt come up in their minds first. its either the hits of IV or the nice jams of II or the newbie fury of I or even houses of the holy. but after listening to some of their albums and deciding for myself, i find this album to be my favorite. and the reason i love this the most is simply because it is in between the jams of II and all of their hits in IV. it was right in the middle of those two cds and thats why i like it so much.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|There isn't a single note of any song on this record that I dont like. I disagree entirely with some of the other people that have written reviews for this saying things like, &quot;worst album EVER!&quot; You can't say that because this is only the SECOND album they have put out. The songs on this cd are all low-level relaxing kind of songs. My personal favorite is the song, &quot;vanishing,&quot; because it sends you into sort of a trance and almost can get you high listening to the song. There are songs on it that are faster paced so I believe there is a little something for everyone. If you like Mer De Noms, you will love this one. I think APC has refined their style from that album and what results? One of the BEST cd's I've ever heard. GET IT
B00000J7JO|4.0|so most people who bought this album saw scar tissue or californication on tv. thats why i bought it. i already had BSSM but i wasnt sure if this was going to be different. After listening to the cd i was shocked at how good this band really were i mean a lot of people had to be dissapointed because not every track had the pop hooks of parallel universe or californication but every track was unique in itself. I think this was a great frusciante comeback the blues was incredible. plus i really like the jams, they are the best part of the cd (end of savior). im willing to keep getting their albums
B00008AWOD|5.0|Only recently, have I discovered Placebo, and already thier music has taken me over. When I listened to the c.d the first time, it was only really \\"Protect Me From What I Want\\" that struck a chord, but when I repeatedly played the album, I sank deeper into the music. <br />I find \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" album, the best c.d I have purchased for a long time, musically and lyrically. I have now started listening to their earlier albums also, though they haven't quite caught my grip as well as this has.<br />My favourites would have to be \\"Protect Me...\\", \\"English Summer Rain\\", \\"Special Needs\\" and the incredible title track \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\".<br />Placebo's music has changed my life, and I just hope that they will continue to spread their music, so more people can be aware of such an incredible band.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I don`t care too much about this band, I like rap-metal but this is not a good way to recognize it. Korn`s nu metal was an innovation, and it inspired some good bands like Limp Bizkit and System of a Down, but this one seems to be something like POP. Hybrid Theory was OK, but this one is not heavy metal...
B0000DZEE3|5.0|It starts off with a powerful, soulful jam which leads into Anthony, along with 80,000 people, singing  the opening lines to By The Way.  The Chili Peppers are one of the greatest live bands ever.  You will be dumbfounded when you hear how perfect everything sounds.  The jams between the songs just showcase how incredible Flea John and Chad are.  John is probebly the most well-rounded guitarists playing today and it shows.  No one can strings chords together like he can.  Flea is GOD.  he is as fast as a metal guitarist with the soul of a funk  singer.  Chad is the second coming of John Bonham.  And Anthony's vocals are flawless.  This DVD is a must for any fan.  It shows the band where they really excede musically , on the stage.
0786869143|2.0|The book disappointed me. There is no definition of what luck is or how it can be measured. Luck in this book doesn't have anything to do with chance events. People who think they are happy, self satisified, and consider themselves lucky, are lucky. They answer some questionaires about themselves in the same way. Unlucky people have common answers too and get lower scores. But Dr. Wiseman doesn't give his tests to random people and check how well the test measure luck in the general sense (for example does indebtedness correlate well with high scores). You get to rate yourself against his pool of data to see if you're lucky or unlucky. Finally, there are some exercises you can do that will help you improve your lot in life, and thereby your luck or is it the other way around. The advice is quite sensible and easy to follow, but it's not going to help you draw to an inside straight the next time you need to.
B000094DUP|5.0|This has got to be the best cd released in the last decade, it blows fellow pop-princesses Cd's right out of the water. Delta stuck number one with born to try after people fell in love with her off Neighbours, so in that sence it appears she was following the footsteps of Kylie Minogue &amp; Holly Valance, but Delta broke new ground by writing her own songs for her album and proving she can sing and play the piano. This talented artist has gone 14 x platnium in australia.<BR>this album is worth purchasing just for the singles, but the other tracks are easily worth the money too. If you think Delta only sings ballads, you obviously haven't heard her latest single the 2 x platnium number one single &quot;predictable&quot;. other examples of up tempo songs on &quot;innocent eyes&quot; are &quot;throw it away&quot;, &quot;running away&quot; and &quot;longer&quot;. personal favourites of mine are &quot;innocent eyes&quot;, &quot;predictable&quot;, &quot;will you fall for me&quot; and &quot;in my own time&quot;<BR>definately worth the money!! best cd in ages and i can't wait for the follow up
B00013F35I|1.0|If I were the engineer or editor, I will be too embarassed to have my name down on the cover of the DVD. It is so badly mixed you can hardly hear performance, making it worse by the unrelentless noise from the overly enthusiatic crowd. At one point, Bruce have to hush them before playing his harmonica in Thunder Road. <br />Bruce does not deserve such a shoddy production. Unless you need a momento for your attendance at the concert, this is not fit for viewing
B00008J2DQ|1.0|You know what really makes me mad? When I find someone who is a Godsmack fan and they have no idea who Alice in Chains even is. This CD is terrible. I never thought I could find more things they ripped off AIC than their band name but I did. The music is so trying to be like AIC's music but they suck really bad at trying. Why can't they give up and just be themselves? Seriously, they're not even creative enough to think of their own band name or anything! And how dare anyone compare this to Metallica. Metallica inspires people, this crap is just for people who have never seen the world beyond MTV. I don't know what to say that has not already been said. The least they can do is just be a cover band of Alice in Chains and not try to actually BE Alice in Chains. Alice in Chains is perfect and priceless, this crap is not worth a cent.
B0001AP12G|5.0|this album is bring back what reality trully is, this album is unlike anything ive ever heard before.

His album covers the whole spectrum anybody who normally doesn't listen to him can trully appreciate this albu, greatly
B00006DEF9|5.0|Delightful movie that not only showcases Gene Kelly's wonderful talents, but that of Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds as well. This movie has a great sense of humor, poking fun at the early talkies in Hollywood, as Kelly and O'Connor team up to put on a new musical.  Debbie Reynolds is not content to supply the voice for the screechy voiced Jean Hagen, who is the reigning star of Hollywood.  Hagen gets her come-uppance in the end in a riotous closing sequence.  But, the signature piece remains the scene where Kelly quite literally dances in the rain after being smitten by the lovely Debbie Reynolds, who seems so fresh and fair in this movie, like an April flower.  The three lead actors play so beautifully off each other, making this one of the most memorable musicals of that era.
B00013PHGS|4.0|French duo Air returns to top form with the excellent &quot;Talkie Walkie,&quot; a charming collection of cool, soft electropop. Air fans won't be disappointed by the combination of the strong points of past releases. It sounds fresh and new, but not TOO new. Air stays connected to what it's done in the past.<br />&quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; is a solid collection of pop (the haunting &quot;Run&quot; and beautiful &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot;), psychedelica (catchy, futuristic-sounding &quot;Surfing on a Rocket&quot;) and beautiful instrumentals (the sweeping acoustic-based &quot;Mike Mills&quot;). As an additional bonus, the CD comes with a bonus DVD of behind-the-scenes footage, musical clips and live footage.<br />Don't expect the second chapter of &quot;Moon Safari.&quot; The latest Air release has a more experimental sound, as if they're trying to make everything balance out. And their attempt is pretty much successful. The dreamy, slightly vulnerable songwriting blends perfectly with a mix of acoustic and electronic music.<br />At times, &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; sags slightly with a riff that doesn't belong or a song that could have been shorter. Most of the time, though, it boasts some pretty impressive instruments -- piano, strings, electric drums, bells and smooth soundscapes. Lyrics are simple, especially in the sweet love song &quot;Venus&quot; (&quot;If you walk in the sun/I will be your shadow&quot;).<br />Smooth, cool and otherworldly, &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; is a beautifully-made release by a talented band. This elegant album is a must-have for music fans.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble blew us all away with their blues debut, Texas Flood. Blues-rock was never any better- not when the Rolling Stones had their glory years or even when Led Zeppelin released their amazing debut. This is an essential blues-rock album, and the key to enjoying it is the guitar. Stevie rips through each song with a long solo or addictive riff while howling into the mike. The best song would be Texas Flood, a song that was amazing on stage. The entire album is his most consistent with not a single mediocre song, and blistering instrumentals, including the soulful Lenny that will turn your heart blue. This is blues rock done better than ever. If this doesn't convince you that Stevie Ray Vaughan is, next to Jimi Hendrix, the greatest guitarist ever, nothing will. If you have a thirst for Texas blues rock buy this right NOW!
B0000BWVCM|2.0|A new war between humans and mutants begins after a attempted murder in the White House against the president of the United States. Now, all the mutants need to fight together against an enemy in common: General William Stryker, who is planning to destroy them all. He uses radical methods to get some information from Magneto, and plans an attack to Prof. Xavier's mutant school when there is only Wolverine and the young students.  By not seeing the first one, I really had no idea what was going on.  The CGI was nicely done but that was about it.  I'm not a fan of Sci-fi

I felt what he felt and saw what he saw. The book was so honest, gripping, brutal, descriptive and beautifully written. I was pulling for James throughout the entire story.<BR>Best and most unforgettable book I have or ever will read!
B0001ADAVK|5.0|Can two actors command a film?  In this creation, Julia Roberts and Kirsten Dunst prove it can be done.  Strong will personalities are portrayed by these two wonderfully convincing ladies.  From the beginning, we are all introduced to Julia Roberts as Katherine Watson, a woman who plans on challenging the way life is at Wellesley, an all female school.  Life is about education, ettiquette, and preparing for marriage.  Katherine wants to change their outlook, their frame of minds, and their goals.  In her quest in this, she sees that her goals will not be easy to come by.<br />Then there is Kirsten Dunst as Betty who strongly believes in what she was taught in Wellesley, and overall is set against Katherine Watson.  These actors' exchange is convincing and it draws you into their worlds and their two different beliefs in what women should do.<br />There are other plots that are connected to the other characters, but overall, Julia Roberts and Kirsten Dunst carries the film with superb acting.<br />The scenes are refreshing, showing campus life set amoung sweeping rivers, rustic landscape, wonderful skies and changing seasons.  Even inside the buildings you were captured by the set up and some of the art.<br />In conclusion, Julia Roberts was excellent, and Kirsten Dunst was amazing.  They were very convincing and strong.  I really enjoyed it.  Maybe, you will, too.<br />Joy.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|The future is in the stock market, says French executive Jean-Charles Perrin to young Xavier, and that with a MA in economics, he can get Xavier a job in his company, as Perrin is a friend of Xavier's father.  To that end, the young man enrolls in the Erasmus, named after Reformation-era scholar Desiderius Erasmus, foreign student programme and goes to Barcelona to finish his degree.<br />Once there, he finds a flat with a group of students from other countries, including Isabelle from Belgium, Lars from Denmark, the clean freak Wendy from Britain, and Alessandro from Italy, a chronic mess-maker whom I tried to find a picture of Oscar from The Odd Couple, but it was probably buried under his mess.  Yes, six, later seven students living together in a cramped apartment does make quite a monkey cage.  He is also befriended by a French couple, the brain specialist Jean-Michel and his wife Anne-Sophie, who put him up for a while pending new living arrangements.<br />The title apartment, with the various students represents a miniaturized European Union, represented by Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and France.  The students are here to mold their future into careers, and their encounters with several students from other parts of the world symbolizes the globalization that's become ever more apparent in the 1990's and the naughts.  Yet one of the effects of that is a meshing of cultures to the point that one goes from being French to being European, soaking in the culture and psyche of his/her fellow students.  One thus learns what it's like to be a foreigner and also to show proper respect to people from other cultures.  The importance of this is demonstrated by Isabelle and some other students, who have learned Castilian, to soberly discover that one professor teaches his courses speaking Catalan, the dominant language in Barcelona.  Another is when Wendy's visiting brother William, who apart from being a nuisance to the students trying to study, unwittingly offends some of them with his ignorance.  Call him the British version of a redneck, someone unaware of the cultural melding taking place.<br />Compare that to Martine, Xavier's girlfriend, played by Amelie's Audrey Tautou.  Despite having less than a combined ten minutes screen-time, there is a scene where we learn she was named after the character in a children's book who fed the farm animals.  She thinks it's sexist that the women had to do all the work, yet Martine also represents a simpler, rural life that's in danger of vanishing in today's globalized world.  Think of the careers post-industrial women have today.  With Xavier gone to Barcelona and his miniature EC, the strain between them represents traditional simplicity versus globalization.<br />Xavier's studies is also a journey to find himself in this multicultural environment, but it becomes an adventure.  He becomes more attuned to his surroundings, and his taking out the slightly shy, un-hip Anne-Sophie on outings, sanctioned by her absentee husband, leads to an affair.<br />Historically, it's interesting and apropos that this story takes place in Spain, which spearheaded the first post-Roman empire in Western Civilization, empires leading to globalism.  Ditto for the name of the student programme, as Erasmus left Paris, like Xavier, and found an affinity towards humanist scholars such as Thomas More in England.<br />The students are well-cast, as they are like any bunch of university students I met in my time at NMSU, with Kelly Reilly (Wendy) and Cecile De France (Isabelle) pulling standout and very likeable performances.  And the location shooting, be it the streets or the coloured frameworks of buildings under construction, brings in a fresh ambience.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Since Britney Spears announced a six-month retirement as 2002 closed and she prayed for more privacy, the media coverage of the global superstar has escalated. From flings with Colin Farrell to Fred Durst, and losing her virginity to posing almost-nude on the cover of Rolling Stone and Esquire, shocking the world by locking lips with Madonna at this year's VMA's and reactions to her former-lover Justin Timberlake's \\"Cry Me A River\\" video, it's safe to say that Britney's time 'out' of the spotlight was not an achievable feat. However, Britney doesn't have to pretend to be a virgin anymore, and the results show on her fourth and latest album \\"In The Zone.\\"<br />Since she first broke five years ago Britney Spears has gone from a teen pop sensation to a global icon, shifting almost 60 million albums along the way. Whipping up controversy and grabbing headlines around the world has become somewhat of a regular occurrence for the former Mickey Mouse Club star. She's criticised everyday and lives her life in a fish bowl, while many forget that she is only a young 22 year old girl experiencing life for the very first time. A downturn in record sales seems perfectly aligned with her rise in media interest, but In The Zone will change all that. 610,000 copies were snapped up in America in its first week of general release, planting Spears firmly atop the US Billboard charts. She also became the first female artist to crash her first four albums straight into the top slot in the week they were released, but what this album tells us more than anything is that Britney Spears is far from over.<br />Lead single \\"Me Against The Music\\" is now already somewhat of a classic pop track. Duetting with Madonna, the two icons display girl power in the most media-hungry way possible. Both artists are helping each other boost their so-called flagging careers, and it really is working. The slick beats and immaculate production are what you can expect from most of the album, which serves as a convincing distraction over Spears' less than average vocals. Britney knows what she wants on this album, and furthermore there's no ambiguity over what zone she's in: be it suggestive lyrics or dirty giggling, she definitely does it in style. After all, sex sells - and no one knows this better than Britney herself. Even though some lines on songs such as \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" - which sees Britney 'getting crunk' in a club with the Ying Yang twins - seem a little out of place, there's no denying the hit-factor.<br />\\"Showdown\\" is a funky slice of R'n'B with the most zesty vocal arrangement heard from Spears to date, while \\"Breathe On Me\\" might just be her greatest song to date - yes, even surpassing that one where she's dressed as a school girl in the video. What was it called again? It's a Kylie-esque dance anthem with infectious beats and saucy lyrics, and it will go down a storm in the clubs. \\"Early Mornin'\\" has a beat that simply sways with a wave of strings, so hot that you'll actually see your speakers melt - I'm serious, check it out. Production nerd Moby is on hand and it shows.<br />The infectious \\"Toxic\\" sees Britney euphoric with carnal delight in a song that sounds totally original to anything she has ever done beforehand. With lyrics such as \\"I'm addicted to you, don't ya know that you're toxic,\\" it's hard to realise what the song is actually about - and that's where the genius lies; as with many Britney songs, you can't differentiate what she's singing about. Here it could be about a guy, drugs, cigarettes or alcohol. The song went to No.1 in the UK and became Britney's first Billboard Top 10 Hit for years.<br />\\"Outrageous\\" is an R Kelly produced number that has a hot club feel to it, with an odd melody that will stay in your head for hours after. \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" is Spears' most overtly-sexual song to date. Bubbling beats lie underneath a belly of boiling hot lyrics, that sizzle and explode halfway through in a glorious display of independence and female sexuality. \\"The Hook Up\\" sees Britney influenced by the recent dance hall craze that has captured acts such as Beyonce, Lumidee and - most notably - Sean Paul. It's a fair attempt, but doesn't really fit with Britney's new style and image. \\"Shadow\\" is a great ballad and actually gives me something interesting to listen to while I'm depressed. However, the song seems out of place on this album.<br />\\"Brave New Girl\\" is the most explicit declaration of independence on the album, as Britney raps on a pure pop bubblegum track that seems born to be on a Legally Blonde soundtrack. The other ballad on the album comes in the form of \\"Everytime,\\" and is rather emotional as many say it's Britney's reply to Justin's comments on her. A drippy piano and just Britney's tearful voice fill the song with a tale of heartbreak that will bring a tear to the eyes of Britney's hardcore fans. It actually comes from the bottom of her heart, and her voice doesn't sound half bad either.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />Britney Spears is an entertainer, pure and simple. She hasn't got an incredible voice like Christina Aguilera, but that's because Christina is a singer and nothing more. Britney has the stage presence to blow anyone away - that's why she steals the show at almost every awards show she performs on. Whether it be cavorting with a snake or ripping off black suits, she does it incredibly well. She knows how to work the masses, and Madonna has recently realised this. I won't lie, I'm a big fan of Britney, and I'm probably be off to see her in concert in May with my more-embarassed mates as I dance in the aisles, hoping my idol will see me trying to attract her attention. In The Zone is a successful evolution in Britney's Madonna-sized blonde ambition, which reinforces her as one of the most intriguing and fascinating stars in the world.nd female sexuality. \\"The Hook Up\\" sees Britney influenced by the recent dance hall craze that has captured acts such as Beyonce, Lumidee and - most notably - Sean Paul.

B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I think it's now safe to say that Bjork ranks alongside Kurt Cobain and Madonna as the artist whom I have most respect for in the music industry. Her ability to consistently produce groundbreaking, fresh and atmospheric music is a natural wonder to me. The way she proves people wrong by not making music in a sense, but making something completely different. An art form. Undiscovered. Until she creates it. That's why she's a genius, and that's why she will always succeed in making a fantastic record. In 1997 Bjork released &quot;Homogenic,&quot; her third solo studio album to date. After listening to this masterpiece, you begin to think Bjork can't do much else in terms of creativity, yet she proved us all wrong in 2000 when she starred in the musical masterpiece &quot;Dancer In The Dark.&quot;<br />Not content with having a leading role in a high-production musical, she also wrote and produced the entire soundtrack, &quot;Selmasongs.&quot; The soundtrack is simply one of the best soundtracks that money can buy and ranks alongside Homogenic and Vespertine as Bjork's greatest work to date. Lush sweeping arrangements of orchestral bliss infuse the album with a wonderfully atmospheric and aesthetically-pleasing back drop of sounds, layered on top of each other. The production and composition is first-class and Bjork is, as ever, 100% original in her approach.<br />&quot;Overture&quot; opens the album. A deep flow of subdued and slightly anticipated instruments introduces the song, and it gradually builds up to a point of almost heart-aching passion at 2:29, and the song gains momentum and flows especially into the first proper song. It's a wonderful instrumental, incredibly dramatic and sets the tone for the soundtrack. &quot;Cvalda&quot; is one of my favourite songs from the album and one of Bjork's best in my opinion. The song starts off with a very interesting beat from an industrial factory. The machines clattering away at work, creating the beat. This then builds up into a gleeful and joyous musical number as Bjork sings so sweetly, &quot;Clatter, crash, clack! Racket, bang, thump!&quot; By the second minute it's an all-out schizophrenia of musical madness. Overall it's a marvellous song that starts off with an expected sense of disappointment but winds up being a mad musical masterpiece.<br />&quot;I've Seen It All&quot; is up next and a fantastic duet between Bjork and the genius Thom Yorke of Radiohead. The song starts off with a train on a track as its beat, before starting off slowly and in a swaying mood. The song gradually builds into a typical Bjork-esque masterpiece (Yeah, most of her songs are masterpieces!) where she sonically opens up the landscapes of the song by adding depth. It's just a pleasure to listen to such wonderful music, and the verbal-fencing style banter between the two is most humorous. &quot;Scatterheart&quot; is said to be the best song on the album by many who have reviewed this soundtrack. For me this is definitely not the case. There is much better on offer here, yet this is still a good song of somewhat lengthy proportions.<br />&quot;In The Musicals&quot; makes hardly any sense at all, but then again, it pays homage to musicals, so it's not really meant to! Here Bjork just appears to have picked up any objects she finds and makes a beat out of them, from a basketball at the start to many other various things towards the end. A superb string section works in complete harmony with a percussion section. Superb, as usual. &quot;107 Steps&quot; starts off incredibly close to the ear with a woman whispering &quot;Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...&quot; and so on, with footsteps in time with the counting. This builds up perfectly to an awesome entrance from Bjork as she sings random numbers. The beat is incredibly catchy and the lush string section that builds up after around 45 seconds is just awe-inspiring. &quot;New World&quot; is the seventh and final song on this brief soundtrack. It startsoff subdued and quiet with the sweeping orchestral beat that opened the record. A trippy electronica beat is added in the background, dancing around to Bjork's soaring vocals. She sings with such passion, such amazement and exploration to the things around her, and a general appreciation for life and love.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />All in all, I cannot recommend this soundtrack enough. I haven't actually seen Dancer In The Dark yet, but I do plan on doing so. I have, admittedly, been trying to pick this album for any possible flaws. I can, as always with masterpieces by Bjork, find none at all, except one - it's a little bit too short. At just over thirty minutes, it's a short and brief soundtrack, but it really is worth paying top money for it because you're sure to get years of musical enjoyment out of this. Selmasongs was the fourth album by Bjork that I bought (around a month ago), and I haven't looked back. Rumour has it she's got a new album out this year, and I am so buying it! But whilst I wait, I know I can revel in the madness and musical beauty that is Selmasongs. Buy it now and treasure it forever.s off subdued and quiet with the sweeping orchestral beat that opened the record.

0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" is, on the surface, about a young boy who is the lone survivor of a shipwreck and ends up on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a tiger.  Pretty soon, all that's left is Pi and Richard Parker, the tiger, and thus begins a journey not just of survival, but also of faith, common sense, and a delicate balance of man-animal interactions.<br />Pi's background as a zookeeper's son allows for interesting perspectives on the lives of animals.  Present in the novel is a defense of zoos and short anecdotes on the anthropomorphism of animals.  Furthermore, Pi asserts that animals are largely creatures of habit in that they unremittingly follow the social caste of their herd and confine themselves within the boundaries of their marked territories.  These two assertions are the main and key pieces of knowledge that Pi uses to survive being at sea for 227 days with a Bengal tiger.  It makes for a truly unique read to see Pi act out accordingly to assert himself as the Alpha male over Richard Parker.<br />The beginning of the novel offers unique and entertaining glimpses into Pi's first encounters with Christianity and Islam and, wishing to simply worship and love his idea of God, Pi practices those two religions in addition to Hinduism.  The beginning of the novel is where most of the religious themes seem to lie.  One notices, however, that it is not simply Pi's religious beliefs that allow him to endure his ordeal, but also the strange and strained companionship of a Bengal tiger in such close proximity.  The novel stresses through Pi's experience of living on a lifeboat with Richard Parker that companionship, no matter how tense or bizarre, is key to surviving a traumatic ordeal.<br />Many people would claim that \\"Life of Pi\\" is a religious novel.  \\"Religious?\\" one might say.  Aye, but Pi does not pray his way across the Pacific Ocean, and, furthermore, it appears that religion is only a springboard from which Pi finds strength to survive being lost at sea.  In this case, common sense and reason prevail.  At the end of the novel, however, Pi assures Japanese investigators that reason, though key to his survival, cannot help one understand everything.  It seems that the biggest and perhaps most religious theme of the entire novel is that reason, based upon one's narrow and limited experiences, fails as a vehicle upon which one might understand and discern the world and stories and experiences of others.<br />\\"Life of Pi,\\" is highly recommended if you're looking for a quick, entertaining, and thought provoking read.

B000099T2L|3.0|We all know better. Calling this her first solo album would be lying to ourselves; she has been carrying the Destiny's Child banner since the inception,though she gave up some vocal duties(probably begrudgingly) to Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. She has had the spotight focused on her since the beginning; now she should be happy since this go around she truly doesn't have to push anybody into the background. There are some great moments on the album of her maturing as a vocalist and as a producer and songwriter; &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot;,featuring her &quot;friend&quot; Jay-Z, is HOT(though I can't stand Jay-Z),the remake<BR>of &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot; with the man himself, Luther Vandross, will score her points with the older music listening community,as will the Chaka Khan-like &quot;Work It Out&quot;, produced be the Neptunes. The problem with this album is one only a mouse should have: TOO MUCH CHEESE!! She's not 16 anymore, in mind, body, or demeanor. She could be one of the greats; she as growing to do, at least musically. But bad news for DC fans; since she has had solo sucess, expect her in this format rather than joined(or should I say, backed) by other singers.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's game is a work of genius, and you cannot say otherwise unless you fully read and understand the book. set on a futuristic earth, Card doesnt go on and on about new inventions and years and junk, but subtly lets you know its way in the future by simply mentioning the invasions and advanced conputer desks the children use in school, and the two children rule, in which you soon understand that the world is over populated. Card never writes anything that people wont read, no boring historys or pages of details (and one would think SciFi would need lotsa detail) Its and easy read, with real depth, into human minds and emotions. and its not only about ender, but his siblings, Peter and Valentine, whome i see are rarly mentioned, three genius children who change the world, willingly or not, despite their ages. Its truely sad and deep, but to enjoy it you need to think, Card tells you the story, but you cant just chew it, enjoy it and spit it out, you have to digest it to get the full meaning and understand the stresses of ender, and his limits.
B0000DBJDM|1.0|I am a Pink Floyd fan. There are at least three phases to PF's evolution. This DVD focuses mostly on the earliest phase and my least favorite. I enjoy the latter two phases and the tail-end of the first phase. This DVD is not &quot;live&quot; in the sense of live music -- some of it is recorded outdoors and &quot;live&quot;, but a real stretch of the term. If you are used to productions like PULSE, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you are used to watching some poor VHS transfers of concerts, this is an improvement. To make it look better, though, many &quot;modern day&quot; items are mixed in. Having listened to PF albums hundreds of times, I was really disappointed with this.

B00006AW2P|5.0|First, a response to a very negative reviewer who said this album made his ears hurt:  It's called Rock & Roll, Junior!!!!  It's supposed to sound raw and impassioned.  Were you expecting something in the vein of Phil Collins or Seals & Crofts?  Yes, the Beatles were definitely the most innovative, prolific, and musically brilliant rock band to ever come from the United Kingdom, I'm certainly not debating that.  But as to which group ROCKED harder, longer, and with the most hip-swinging, soul-swaggering pathos, it's The Stones, hands down!!!  The Stones were NOT a duplicate of the Beatles, they are a total original.  I'd rather hear the Stones in '62 than the Beatles in the same year, when they were mostly doing bubblegum ditties and merseybeat ballads.  If it were the Beatles of \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", maybe it'd be a (slightly) harder decision.  This isn't to say that I don't love the Beatles, but they adapted to a rock style much later than the Stones, whose humble working-class upbringings in the dreary industrial sector of England gave them the hard-bitten cynicism and youthful angst to make hard-rock sentiments come as second-nature.  Having said that, I can not even begin to extoll this deliciously furious, infectiously catchy album enough.  This first album chronicles their love affair with 50's and 60's soul and R&B, and they pull it off in spades.  Even the Beatles could never do the music of early bluesmen and black rockers like Chuck Berry this much justice.  The Stones take music that was already brilliant, and make it even BETTER!  Could you ask for a more rollicking interpretation of \\"Can I Get a Witness?\\", or \\"Walkin' the Dog\\"?  This is the Stones at their roughest, most raw-edged, musically unbridled beginnings, and this album of covers, to me at least, is just as satisfying and revolutionary as the Stones' original work (which is an outstanding, enduringly phenomenal and still-growing ouvre in and of itself).  In closing, yes, these are covers, and yes, they are RAW as they come.  But that's Rock & Roll, baby!!!  So kick up the stereo and enjoy!!!

B00013RC8O|5.0|My favorite road movie of all time. I think this is a better film than Easy Rider. Barry Newman's subtle non-machismo performance is the perfect contrast to the awesome muscle car which carries him to his vanishing point. I just listened to the dvd commentary track by director Richard C Sarafian, where he claims his choice for Newman's role was Gene Hackman. I don't think Hackman could have done a better job, in fact the balance of the car and the driver would not have been the same. Gene Hackman is an incredible actor, but Barry Newman was, in my opinion, ideal for this film. A work of great beauty, and the haunting loss of a freer epoch. Incredible handheld cinematography by the late great John A Alonzo, married to an uplifting and deeply poignant soundtrack. This film can be viewed on many different levels from an exciting car chase movie to a true American existential classic. I never get tired of works of art and Vanishing Point is such a work. I can't understand why 20th Century Fox failed to put out a soundtrack album. &quot;Another Soul Goes Free&quot;
B00008BXJF|5.0|This is not only the greatest King Crimson record, but also may be one of the greatest records in modern music period, IMHO.  It is a concept album and the music challenge the listners.  My friend who is a classical music fan was blown away by listening experience of this album.  If you are looking for top 40 hits, catchy hooks, or simple three chords ditty, this album or King Crimson may not be for you.  But anyone who says &quot;I love music,&quot; needs to listen to this album.  It will be an experience.<BR>Some listening advice; Do not play this album as a background music, or do not try to dace to it at parties.  The best way to appreciate it is sit down in front of your CD player/speakers, make sure there is no distraction, and play the album.  Actively listen, concentrate, study it, play the air drums (if you can keep up with the beasty Pat Mastelotto that is!), and do not stop or leave in the middle of the music or CD but listen to the entire album, from start to finish.  After that go to your computer and check the website discipline global mobile(record label of King Crimson and other cool artists established by Robert Fripp, [...] ) and learn more.

It's definitely not the kind of movie you want to watch more than once.  Plus, Coppola apparently has a personal bias against attractive blondes.  The only people she portrays completely negatively in the movie seem to be blonde American women  -  first w/Kelly (Anna Faris) and then with the woman near the end who approaches Bob (Murray) in the hotel lobby as he's leaving to say she admires him and is immediately brushed off by him when he spots Charlotte (Johannson).  Coppola's intent here seems to be to reinforce the old stereotype of dumb blondes, and this is definitely a turn-off.
B00008MLSH|5.0|Wow. The very first song from Mozart's &quot;Idomeneo&quot; caught me! She has obviously absolutely mastered Mozart. Such an open, liberating voice for such a young woman. I love it! She says that she has taken quite a liking to the French repertoire, and it shows in &quot;Manon&quot; and &quot;Benvenuto Cellini.&quot; She has been quoted as stating that she likes roles &quot;with a little danger,&quot; not just the lighter Mozart roles (which get boring really fast), which I am exstatic to hear, because I would love to see her in as dramatic a role as Tosca someday. I would even settle for Boheme's Mimi right now! I am desperate to see this woman do some Puccini verismo... and quick, before she turns haggard, like most of the other divas!   hehehe
B00000099Y|3.0|...but strangely enticing if you're in the mood - or you're a juvenile deliquent.  Either way, like all of Tool's work, this album hardly differs from its predecessors in the elaborately constructed shock value that's demonstated through dark and troubling lyrics.  Shall we say Keenan has issues?  One glance at this and previous albums can answer that question.  However, it's interesting to note that with each successive release the central message seems to be getting increasingly lighter and even a bit positive.  Has Keenan found the light?  Not with this album.  Try Lateralus for evidence of that.
B0001ENY6M|4.0|When I watched the film &quot;The passion of the Christ&quot; I felt as I didn't see an American movie,<BR>And this made the film original and special, the actors and the environment were chosen very cleverly .After all it was great pleasure to me to hear Armenian music in the film , which was played also by an Armenian instrument &quot;duduk&quot; ,especially in the scene where &quot;a woman giving water to Jesus &quot; .This music is adapted from a famous old Armenian folksong &quot;Deli yaman&quot;<BR>I know that John Debney didn't mentioned it but it's not necessary, you can check this in the &quot;Djivan Gasparian&quot; cedes ,who  composed with  Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard in the score &quot;Gladiator&quot;, and he also have played duduk in that score.<BR>However Mel Gibson have done a great job and thanks him to give back the looking of Jesus in the films to his region <BR>Middle East  from where I am .Linda Chamichian
B0000C6E4D|2.0|I don't enjoy writing bad reviews of the works of talented artists, but I can't lie.  This album is a total letdown.  The lyrics are good and perhaps more personal and darker than ever, but the music is pure fluff.  This is Sarah pandering to the mainstream, Britney Spears-loving, musically mindless masses.  Most of the songs sound the same and except for the lyrics are quite boring.  I do, however, enjoy her single &quot;Fallen.&quot;  This song retains some of her former grace and originality, but I wouldn't waste my money on this album if I were you.  It's nothing new.  Her previous albums are much more superior, especially Surfacing.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I am not surprised at the number of people who did not like this movie. More often than not, unsophisticated viewers need every little twist and turn explained and explicitedly shown to them for them to understand it. What these people enjoy is a Hollywood cookie-cutter picture with an obvious start, an obvious climax, and an obvious ending. Without these three parts, a movie just doesn't seem complete to them. They have no ability to read between the lines.<br />An example of such people... A critic at Amazon said she was so bored, she felt she would summarize the movie to save us from having to watch it. She goes on to state that Bob Harris is a washed up comedy actor. WRONG! He's a washed up actor, true, but likely an action film star, a James Bond type actor. She also goes on to say that Charlotte's hubby is a travelling musician. Hellooooo? Did she miss the part where he's packing his CAMERA GEAR and where Kelly says that he's &quot;ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE PHOTOGRAPHER&quot;? Subtlety is lost on stupid people.<br />Fine. This movie isn't for you. Go rent Rambo.
B000069AUI|5.0|It took a while for this one to grow on me, but now it's one of my favorites.  I love &quot;In My Place&quot; and &quot;Amsterdam,&quot; which gets better as it goes along.  And it is good driving music - very relaxing and uplifting.  I would place it up there with Beck's Seachange and Dave Matthews Band's Remember Two Things for being a very therapeutic kind of album.  I can't quite put my finger on why it's so soothing, but it must have something to do w/the vibe and energy that's put into this work that shines through.  There aren't too many albums that I like to listen to all the way through, but this is definitely one of them.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|&quot;Last Chance&quot; (3/5): A decent song, not a great opener though.<BR>&quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl?&quot; (5/5): The lead single, a great tune that you can't help but sing along to.<BR>&quot;Rollover D.J.&quot; (4/5): This song always makes me wanna move.<BR>&quot;Look What You've Done&quot; (4/5): A great ballad.<BR>&quot;Get What You Need&quot; (3/5): An average song, but nothing more.<BR>&quot;Move On&quot; (3/5): A good ballad, kinda Pink Floyd-ish.<BR>&quot;Radio Song&quot; (3/5): Not a bad tune, just not great.<BR>&quot;Get Me Outta Here&quot; (4/5): This up-tempo track is a winner.<BR>&quot;Cold Hard B***h&quot; (4/5): The second single that should prove that the band isn't a one hit wonder.<BR>&quot;Come Around Again&quot; (4/5): Another killer ballad.<BR>&quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot; (4/5): Yet again, Jet proves they're the kings of the fast paced tracks.<BR>&quot;Lazy Gun&quot; (3/5): A decent song, but nothing memorable.<BR>&quot;Timothy&quot; (3/5): A less than thrilling conclusion to a thrilling album.<br />&quot;Get Born&quot;, the debut from Aussie rockers Jet is music to my ears. Though some of the ballads can become tiresome, every fast paced song on this record is a winner. Definately worth checking out, especially if you're into the garage rock scene.<br />Rating: Three and a half stars.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|In all fairness, I too was disappointed in this film the first time I saw it.  The opening seemed to drag on and on.  It seemed overblown, overbudgeted, and far from what the Matrix series was originally intended to be.<br />However, after I watched it again (and many more times since), this is the one installment of the trilogy that always mesmerizes me.  Sure it's more of a standard sci-fi action movie than the original Matrix, but despite this feel, it is actually far more complex and intelligent than the original Matrix ever was.  (or than Revolutions could possibly have been, since it was essentially just a long &quot;final battle&quot; sequence)<br />The level of philosophical symbolism is incredible in this film.  From the obvious continuation of symbolic names (Soren, the Logos, etc...) to the more powerful concepts that the film offers about Sci-Fi, action epics, and human nature itself.  Pay close attention to the first half of the film.  Find the places in which it appears to reference Star Wars, Star Trek, and Religious Epics, and other films in history.  Pay attention to where these echoes of past films are inserted and what they mean.<br />For example, Morpheus' overblown preaching in the cave.  Do you let it simply irritate you?  Or do you examine why the filmmaker's chose to turn Morpheus into an apocalyptic preacher?<br />Or another example, what does it mean that almost every human in a position of power in the film turns out to be some form of religious extremist?  From Morpheus' messianic rantings to the anti-religious rationality of Zion's Military Commander.  And how are we to interpret the fact that in the end every one of them is wrong...<br />I won't answer those questions.  As the cliche goes, art means whatever it means to you.  This film is so open and so intellectual that it can make you think about truly profound religious issues.  If you're willing to give it that level of thought.<br />On repeated viewing, this is one of the most challenging Hollywood films in recent memory.  Despite its many flaws, the intellectual depth of this film keeps it far above most films that have been released in the past 10 years.<br />The power of the Matrix series was never in its ability to entertain.  Its most important feature was always its ability to make us think, and in that regard, the Matrix sequels succeed spectacularly.
B00005AQGH|5.0|&quot;All Eyez On Me&quot; was the best 2Pac album ever, but his second best is none other than &quot;The 7 Day Theory.&quot;  Recorded under the alias Makaveli, 2Pac created one of the best rap cd's of all time.  His Makaveli style is more fierce than on his earlier albums, where his lyrics weren't exactly nice either, but you really can feel the anger in his songs.  This album was recorded and put together before he died, so it has that special touch that was only present in his releases before he passed away in late 1996.  (Unlike some his cd's after deah that are so poorly put together.)  It is easy to just sit back and listen to this whole album, without skipping once, and really relate to 2Pac.  The highlights include &quot;Hail Mary,&quot; &quot;To Live &amp; Die In L.A.,&quot; and &quot;Krazy,&quot; though every song is good on this album.  The intro/song to this cd is very good and &quot;Against All Odds&quot; is another diss track hurled at the East Coast rappers (primarily at Nas and Puffy).  The tracks' beats and Makaveli's rhymes make for a dark mood on this album, with the exception of &quot;Toss It Up,&quot; which is more of a party track.  &quot;Me and My Girlfriend,&quot; a very good song on here, will sound very familar to &quot;03 Bonnie and Clyde,&quot; in which Jay-Z did a horrible remake to this classic. It is hard to chose which 2Pac album I like more, &quot;Me Against The World&quot; or &quot;The 7 Day Theory,&quot; but I have to give it to this one due to the great beats and lyrics.  The Outlawz are not overused on this album, which makes for a pleasant flow throughout all 12 songs.  To wrap this up, this is a great album by the greatest rapper to ever live, and this album needs to be in your collection.  You will not be dissapointed. <br />R.I.P. Tupac Amaru Shakur
B0001ENY6M|5.0|A master craftsman, Debney really nailed this score.  I was moved by the crux of the last act, with the relentless pounding of symphonic verve.  Debney's handling of variations of tempo really hammered the emotional points home.
0156029065|2.0|Page after page of Eco spinning his wheels, never really saying anything.  Every sentence pokes fun at something.  Baudolino reminds me of Catch-22; both make you laugh, and after 500 hundred pages of the same jokes over and over you get tired.  I started putting it down for a week every once in a while, and I never missed it.  When I picked it back up again it was always amusing for the first day, then I would get bored again.  <br />The novel is tedious.  Zero stars for readability.<br />You do learn a little about the history of language, and Eco does an excellent job of making you feel like you relate to, humans living in the 12th-13th century.  2 pity stars.<br />Read Calvino if you are looking for a contemporary Italian novelist with fascinating prose and something to say.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|Before director Paul Verhoeven gave us the ultra gory and special effects laden &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; in the 1990s, he lensed the gritty 1987 movie &quot;Robocop.&quot; Verhoeven, of course, never limited himself to producing science fiction gorefests; he also made the controversial &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; and, more importantly, carries most of the blame for &quot;Showgirls.&quot; The latter film would have permanently ended a lesser director's career, but not Verhoeven. He's still gamely making interesting pictures. &quot;Robocop&quot; may have been his first real success story; fans love the first film, many critics adored it when it came out, and no less of a company than Criterion decided to give it a spectacular release on DVD. Sadly, I did not get a chance to view the Criterion disc; I had to settle instead for the lesser MGM treatment. If you want to see &quot;Robocop&quot; with all the trimmings, seek out the Criterion Collection DVD. It has tons of extras including most of the footage originally cut from the theatrical release in order to avoid the notorious 'X' rating for violence. Still, if you cannot find a Criterion disc, go ahead and check out the MGM one anyway. &quot;Robocop&quot; is such a fun movie, such a hilarious social satire about the greed of the 1980s, that even watching it on television is preferable to not seeing it at all.<br />Verhoeven sets his film in a disturbing near future Detroit where corporations have assumed most of the functions of civil society. Big business runs, for example, city police departments. The suits on the top floors fund crime prevention measures at the same time they market new products. One corporation in Detroit called OCP, sick of rampant crime and looking for a way to level a large part of the city in order to build a huge complex of buildings, starts researching new and innovative weapons to battle the anarchy rapidly taking over the city. One way to accomplish this feat is to remove human beings from patrol duty. Who wants to explain why dozens of cops die every week in violent shootouts with criminal gangs? Who needs the bad PR from such unseemly events? Not OCP. If the company can develop a robot to do the dirty work, costs will drop, profits will go up, and everyone will bask in the glow of a job well done. There is one big problem with the new programs--they don't work. Try as they might, the company keeps coming up with one expensive failure after another. After the latest model turns one of the corporation's executives into swiss cheese in the boardroom, an up and coming suit gets his big break from the boss. Fortunately for this greedy little runt, Officer Alex Murphy happens to die in the line of duty while trying to bring down one of the biggest crime bosses in the city.<br />&quot;Robocop&quot; takes off from this point, as the corporation turns Murphy into a mean looking cyborg, an armor plated automaton capable of blowing off the bad guys' heads as easily as he can create good PR for the company by making televised appearances at local schools. Heck, this huge mechanized cop can even drive a car, speak to people, and survive withering gunfire. Problems emerge when Robocop starts to regain memories of his former life, recollections of his wife and child, his female partner, and the bad guys who blew him away. When the cyborg launches a campaign to bring his killers to justice, the corporation that created him turns ugly. It seems a few suits have a several nasty secrets better left hidden, and Robocop's quest for justice threatens to bring to light things that could ruin careers. Soon the cops and the criminals are gunning for the confused cyborg in a series of chases and shootouts loaded with over the top violence and extreme gore. Will Robocop get his man in the end? Will he reconcile his human memories with his robotic exterior? Who knows, but finding out is a lot of fun.<br />One thing you might notice about &quot;Robocop&quot; is Verhoeven'svision about corporation politics. His take on big business in the 1980s is uniformly cynical as he constructs a world where the boardroom is no better than the conflicts taking place outside on the mean streets. The top floors of OCP seethe with violent conflicts as department heads jockey for position with the boss in order to promote their own agendas. Murder, conspiracy, drug use, and a host of other anti-social behaviors inform the daily activities of the company's managing elite. Is &quot;Robocop&quot; Verhoeven's way of taking a slap at the lack of business ethics in the 1980s? Of course! If a commentary on how to run an evil corporation leaves you cold, however, you can always enjoy the great performances. Miguel Ferrar conveys sleazy here like no one else in the movie world. Ronny Cox, when summoned to play a baddie, rarely fails to deliver a memorable turn. Peter Weller does Murphy/Robocop in a way that draws real emotion. Nancy Allen takes her role as Murphy's caring partner seriously even though the film doesn't really do much with her. One of my favorites, Kurtwood Smith, plays the slimy crime boss Clarence Boddicker with enthusiastic gusto.<br />I hate to harp, but you really should try to find the Criterion DVD version of this film. That disc has a commentary from Verhoeven and a bunch of other interesting stuff. The MGM release pales in comparison, as anyone who has ever viewed a MGM disc knows anyway. Still, you do get most of the super gory scenes--Murphy's death sequence, the toxic sludge bath, and the arterial puncture scene--in their partial glory. If you liked &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and you haven't watched &quot;Robocop&quot; yet, now is the time to get moving.vision about corporation politics.

Great pop from the 80's for sure...Don't wait any longer to purchase this item this soundtrack is a classic.

0385504209|1.0|Come on, people. &quot;Stupid&quot; doesn't necessarily equate &quot;Fun&quot;.<br />Aside from the fact that the credibility of this book has been consistently trashed by scholars, the writing is poor to the point that it would be laughed out of a high school English class.<br />I'm wondering if there should be a required &quot;What was the last book you read?&quot; question, for amazon reviewers. I have a hunch the majority of these five star ratings would also include a lot of Danielle Steele and Stephen King.
B00008977N|5.0|This is more than a concert; it is a show, a drama.  The musicians fit perfectly for Gabriel's sound.  Paula Cole adds so much with her voice to the feeling of the songs that I would say at times this is a concert of Gabriel/Cole.  The song selection is excellent.  The stage design which changes all the time according to the theme of the song is inspiring.  Every action of the musicians adds so much to the concert.  I write this much, and yet at this moment I am frustrated, cause I know, my words are not describing sufficiently how I am touched by this concert.  I have Gabriel's last DVD as well, simply because I bought this one first.  Had I bought the other one first, would I buy this one?  Maybe not, and that would be a terrible mistake.

I thought at first i wouldn't like it because it looked like a very farfetched story-line, but once i started reading it I was facinated.<br />Card has mastered the science fiction story by adding believable characters and seemingly real-life problems they face.<br />Although it is kind of complex and has some adult themes (just one accidental murder, but no nudity or anything) it was very interesting<br />I loved it so much i went out and got ender's shadow which was another great buy<br />i would recomend this to ages 14 and up<br />it is a great easy read
B000094HMU|5.0|The stage looks just fabulous.  <BR>The orchestra sounds great under the direction of James Levine.  Eva Marton is perfect for this role.  Her voice so powerful yet with soft qualities.  Domingo does very well here, but his &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; is pretty weak...  he's not Pavarotti.  Over all, this is a must get DVD.  I just bought it recently and you'll not be disappointed.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|The Radio City concert was an amazing experience - at the end of the Greendale performance a full house was on its feet cheering for two-three minutes. Yes, in the beginning I saw a few people leave but it was an honor to hear the work of a talented songwriter and performer who obviously believes in the importance of growing and changing as life goes on. Open your mind to Greendale and you are in for a treat. It's a courageous, original and brilliant work. I highly recommend the CD.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|Definitely the worst matrix movie.  It was a disappointing and stupid ending. It's as if the director(s) had just said \\"oh, bugger this,\\" and neglected the salvagable story.  I bet I could have written something better than this.  There was definitely lots of balls-to-the-wall action in Zion(hence the 2-star rating), but the Neo/Smith battle was kind of cheesy.  Get the Return of the King instead.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The concert event had the chance to be sappy and morose.  Thank God, it isn't. Instead, it's a lot of George's friends covering his songs, having fun doing it, and otherwise doing what they've always been doing.<br />Summary: Great guests, superior musicianship. Buy This DVD. Now.<br />The show opens with a few words from Clapton, who introduces Ravi Shankar and his daughter.  They play a fair amount of Indian music.  It's pretty good, I have to admit, though not my cup of tea.  One word - Ravi Shankar's daughter is quite the sitar player... She plays a piece and violates at least 2 rules of physics. Amazing.<br />Then the Western band forms up. They play a number of songs, with luminaries being introduces and added to the band over the course of the evening.<br />Highlights, in no particular order:<BR>1) Ringo :-)  During &quot;Honey Don't&quot;  Look for Albert Lee. His solo is blistering though short.<BR>2a) Clapton on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;<BR>2b) Clapton having the class to not play all the solos thereby making it the &quot;Eric Clapton Show.&quot;  Instead most of the real guitar work is being done by someone I don't know. I think it's Clapton's long-time guitarist.  My son and I call him &quot;THE Guy&quot;.<BR>2c) Clapton in general<BR>3) Watch Tom Petty's guitar player get OWNED by George on &quot;Taxman&quot;.  Tom does this song kinda weird, it's probably the weakest track.<BR>4) Sam Brown. What a voice!<BR>5) Waa Waa. Amazing.<BR>6) Something by Paul, via uke.<BR>7) Ravi's daughter and her sitar. Your eyebrows will fly up!<BR>8) Dhani has George's spooky eyebrow thing going on.<BR>9) Jeff Lynne is there, and takes an active part doing what he does best.  Bob Dylan is notably absent.<br />Every track is worthwhile and many are superb.  And while a lot of similar productions are muddy and horrid, this isn't.  Eric is running the show, and keeps it moving and clean.  <br />The only dings I give this production are<BR>1) The &quot;behind the scenes&quot; footage is too sparse. I know there had to me more...<BR>2) The band isn't introduced well enough.  I expected a close up of every performer, with a hello, and a name.  See 2b) above.

Note that on &quot;Don't&quot;, Gilmour is playing what I believe to be the oldest known Fender Telecaster (Broadcaster?) You know he's liking THAT!<br />Anyway, this is a no-brainer. Buy.<br />-=-=-=-<BR>Keep in mind that this isn't Pink Floyd. It's David Gilmour. Not the same thing.  If you're expecting Pink Floyd, move on.
0156027321|5.0|This is a story of survival. As is any life; yours or mine. Our lives are filled with undulating waves of joy and pain and we simply cope, but never give up, we just keep swimming. We try to make sense of whatever we're dealing with by comparing it to something else we think we actually understand. <br />A little kid shipwrecked tries to survive in the middle of the Pacific ocean...with a wild murderous tiger...alone in a boat. What metaphor can this little boy possibly draw upon to survive such a problem? Or is it a solution?<br />Read the book.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|Okay, no more movies with stupid dead kids that communicate to the living.  No more stupid thrillers that have these bad endings (i.e. Identity).  No more remaking classic rock songs (the who's \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\") for the soundtrack by no talent hacks by pseudo bands like 'limp bizkit'.  The movie looked alright, had the normally unwatchable bad actress Penelope Cruz, prepostorous story and Halle Berry.  SKIP IT.
0385504209|1.0|My only reason for writing this &quot;review&quot; is to make known my disgust, as a black woman, the views and comments made by a &quot;reviewer&quot; named Minerva.<br />Minerva, don't you even dare to preface your bigotted outlook by claiming you are not a racist. Darling, you are a typical middle class white woman who holds women of color in contempt and jealousy.<br />Us black women don't have time to worry about such flighty notions such as &quot;patriarchy&quot; (that is the way to correctly spell it sweety). Black women in this country, unlike most comfortable middle class white women, are naturally strong -in mind, body and spirit- and have no need for crutches like &quot;goddesses&quot; and all such fairy tales. We struggle with very real, very dangerous aspects of life everyday 24/7. We don't have the time to whine about some novel. We black women are trying to make a better life for ourselves and our children, sadly often alone without our men to assist us. How dare you even question our strength when unlike most white women we keep our jobs, our families, our lives going day-to-day without the security and comfort of a man! You white women can indulge yourselves in specious and frivolous causes while waiting for that paycheck from your white husbands! Most of you have nothing better to worry about!<br />As for &quot;getting hair and nails done&quot;...Honey, you white women monopolized over 200 years in this country of enjoying the pedestal your White Man placed you upon. Nobody can ever hope to outdo you white women in the vanity stakes! You were prettifying yourselves when my female ancestors were working in your fields, your kitchens and taking care of your children and servicing your men all the while pampering your every whim. Too bad the whole world no longer beats a beaten path to the emaciated, pale feet of the white women anymore. It's so sad for you. Now perhaps you'll learn true feminine strength. One that cannot afford the luxury fantasies of man-hating, baby-killing, lesbian playing and goddess worshipping.-hating, baby-killing, lesbian playing and goddess worshipping.
B000002GJ7|5.0|Yes, 5 stars.  Even after all the years this CD has been out and after all the CDs that have come and gone, Pornograffitti remains in my top 5 CDs of all time (and I am a huge music fan).  No words describe the genius of Nuno Bettencourt, he and the rest of Extreme never got the attention or respect they deserved from the &quot;main stream&quot; music community - but there are plenty of fans like me who recognize their brilliance.  Okay, you may think I'm overdoing it, but I promise, I'm not.  Just turn up the guitar riff on Suzi to full volume, sit in front of the speakers, and behold the genius.  Do not hesitate one second in buying this CD - it will be the best purchase you ever made.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|The &quot;Wasteland&quot; in the title of this review simply being the state of the current music industry as a whole...<br />Buy this album... Simple isn't it?<br />If you've logged onto this review area you must have taste, especially to review an album that is ranked only at 3700-something.<br />For Neal, though I don't know him, rankings don't matter. This CD is such a great example of just being one's self and shouting out loud, &quot;This is me!&quot;-- love me or leave me...<br />After one listen, you won't be leaving. My personal guarantee (binding from one music lover to another).<br />Buy this album... <br />No need to go into the musical meat and potatoes. Already been done to death by previous reviews...<br />Buy this album and never be the same again.<br />Sincerely,<br />A friend
630522577X|5.0|The restoration of this popular movie and it's placement on DVD is absolutly astounding.  Watch the movie first and then watch it again with the directors commentary and all will be explained.<br />The sheer sharpness of the colour and sets are still relevant today as they were 40 years ago... Of course Audrey Hepburn's Eliza verses Rex Harrison's Higgins is what this movie's all about.
B000075BFK|5.0|Tupac Shakur is one of the most influential rap artists of all time. He is also one of the few music artists that have transcended his genre. Even after his untimely death in 1996, Tupac Shakur has released more albums now than he ever did alive. The greatest thing about Shakur's music is that it is eternally relevant unlike a good portion of music, espicially rap, that fades into obscurity. Tupac didn't rap about passing fads; he rapped about issues that would forever be inextricable with mankind.<br />Released closely near his movie and soundtrack, Tupac Resurrection, I will tell you upfront that this CD eclipses the Resurrection soundtrack. Not only is it longer, but it is more of Tupac's style. The album begins with an amazing introduction where a reporter is on the scene of Better Dayz's release night. In the background, a crowd is chanting for the record, creating a &quot;pumped up&quot; feeling that you may experience before going into a sport game. After the introduction, it merges into the first track, &quot;Still Ballin.&quot; Still Ballin is the second part of the &quot;Straight (or Str8) Ballin&quot; track (you can find this on the Resurrection CD). Still Ballin is an excellent track with an amazing beat and quality rapping. It's one of the album's best tracks, fast paced and intense.<br />The next track, a change of pace, is a slower but more hostile track. &quot;When We Ride On Our Enemies&quot; is a diss to &quot;Da Brat,&quot; &quot;Mobb Deep&quot; and &quot;The Fugees.&quot; The Fugees feud began when the Fugees evidently dissed Tupac, causing him to retaliate. Furthermore, The Fugees were continually calling gangsta rap too &quot;heavy.&quot; Tupac just derails Mobb Deep, and even though it is belligerent, it is a great song with excellent quality. Other memorable tracks include &quot;F*** 'Em All,&quot; dissing Bad Boy Entertainment, specifically The Notorious B.I.G., &quot;Late Night.&quot; Late Night is one of the album's best tracks; it is a mellow, laid back song you can just sit back and chill too. Then there is the unforgettable &quot;Thugz Mansion.&quot; Both versions (the Nas Acoustic and the original) are included on the album.<br />The juxtaposition of both discs yields about the same quality. I listened to Disc 1 avidly for a week, and then listened to Disc 2. Both house some of the best Tupac songs ever created. The best part about &quot;Better Dayz&quot; is the enthrallment of the discs. Even though the disc touches some highly African-American/&quot;Ghetto&quot; issues, the disc creates an atmosphere where you don't feel disconnected. Even as a white male, I felt a strong relation with issues I have never even experienced. Furthermore, I'd like to point out one of the album's most amazing aspects. Most of these songs were written over eight years ago yet you can easily find an affinity towards the tracks. In this time of global instability and rapid change, we all are truley looking for the &quot;better dayz.&quot; It's amazing that, in a future that no one could foresee, Tupac's music holds up.<br />Fans of rap music in general, or even spectators on the edge of the genre will definetly want to pick &quot;Better Dayz&quot; up. It is one of Tupac's finest achievements as an artist and activist. The album is of exceptional quality, dwarfing it's sister album &quot;Resurrection.&quot; It pays equal homage to the more serious issues Tupac writes about, as well as his strong African-American roots and experiences. While listening to the issue, you are transported from the realms of &quot;white&quot; or &quot;black&quot; and simply enter an impartial state where everything seems relevant and important.
B00005JN02|5.0|I am originally from East Germany. I lived there in 1989. I saw the demonstrations happen in my hometown (not Berlin), I felt the tension, but also the excitement and insecurity of the days following the fall of the wall.<br />I watched the movie last year in Germany, watched in in December again when it was released on DVD in Germany and am planning to show it to my students in a politics class. That is how much I love this movie. I love it because he shows something very simple ... the things a person wants to go through for the love of his mother. But also because it quite adequately portrays the time of 1989 and 1990. It shows how excited people became if they already got their car after waiting \\"only 3 years\\" when it was normal to wait 10+ years. It shows also how proud East Germans were about some of their achievements, how attached they were to the system and I know how hard it was and still is for some to deal with the demise of the GDR. It gives a bit of an insight in the problems and ways of thinking from that time.<br />The movie is fascinating on many levels and entertaining and humorous on so many others. Katrin Sass, an actress from East Germany, and Daniel Bruehl who plays her son, make a great cast for the movie. Katrin Sass, because she can portray the die-heart communist with such credibility, not overdone nor distorted, and Daniel Bruehl because he plays this young man so well. The movie comes with high recommendation from me.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|If I live to be a 100 years old I will never understand what some people see in movies like this one. It is a very very boring movie. My girlfriend and I both agreed on this one. Bill Murray has made some good movies (not this one) One review said if you are dumb as a rock you wouldn't like this one. I guess we are just a couple of stones in among the millions and millons who think the same way.<br /> This movie will probably be in the discount pile of your local rental store in a very short period. So if you want to buy it just wait and get a bargain.
B00003CXB2|4.0|Being an epic of awesome proportions, the DVD edition can only be seen on widescreen above 40 inch proportions.  Needing two discs, half-time is appropriate.  Full of information and directors commentarys, you will not go wrong placing this DVD set in your library.
B000084T18|1.0|What a bunch of record company, packaged crap.  This guy makes Mike Tyson look like a flipping rocket scientist.  He can't sing.  He can't dance.  He can't speak english.  At least Emimem has a sense of humor.  Listen kids, if you deal crack, you too can end up looking like a materialistic, ho-mongering thug.  Gee, maybe if we're lucky, Saddam will come out with a CD rapping about how he survived nine bombing raids.  Hey I think I might be on to something.

B00004Y6NP|5.0|A long, long time ago in a PA city called Williamsport, I won one of the very first Sony Discman players in a radio essay contest. It was sponsored by Sony and came with ten CBS discs. Frankly there weren't too many other CD's on the market at the time. So I went out and bought a few. \\"Brothers In Arms\\" was one of them, since I was already a Dire Straits fan and the disc had just come out. Then the disc player arrived. It wasn't very big (although compared to the ones out now, it was huge), about the size of small shoe box. In fact, my initial response was, \\"this is it?\\" Feeling a little disappointed, I plugged it in and decided to test it with \\"Brothers In Arms.\\"<br /><br />I soon had several friends on the phone, telling them that they had to come over to my apartment RIGHT NOW and listen to \\"Money For Nothing\\" on this little device. I had a pretty decent stereo at the time and nothing, and I do mean absolutely nothing, sounded like the way this CD did coming from my speakers. The way the room filled with pure, crystal clear sound, and a very broad \\"soundstage\\" that was unlike any other 12 inch record I owned. \\"Brothers In Arms\\" became, along with Donald Fagen's \\"The Nightfly\\" and Billy Joel's \\"Innocent Man,\\" the disc I used to show off the joys of the new CD format.<br /><br />Of course, technology has since caught up and most CD's sound pretty good overall, and I wore that little Discman out. But \\"Brothers In Arms\\" has kept a special place in my library because -- even prior to the upgrade -- it remains a sonic marvel. Considering its age (the album first came out in 1985), the best thing about this Dire Straits disc is that the songs still manage to impress. There's so much variety here, from \\"So Far Away,\\" with the signature dobro slide, to the four song suite that originally comprised the album's side two. Those four songs were an almost folkish anti-war piece, in particular the stunning \\"The Man's Too Strong.\\" Knopfler's very dry humor also at its peak here with the band's best known hit, \\"Money For Nothing.\\"<br /><br />\\"Brothers In Arms\\" doesn't have my favorite Dire Straits' song on it (that would go to \\"Telegraph Road\\"), but it is their best album in a career of great ones. And it STILL makes a great listener experience CD.best known hit, \\"Money For Nothing.\\"     \\"Brothers In Arms\\" doesn't have my favorite Dire Straits' song on it (that would go to \\"Telegraph Road\\"), but it is their best album in a career of great ones.

0767802470|5.0|The father of all Submarine movies.<br />Wolfgang Petersen's movie version of his epic mini-series, Das Boot, is brought out of the depths of the sea by DVD.  <br />The epic tale of the U Boat commander (Jurgen Prochnow)and his motley crew fighting for the fatherland is shown in all it's filthy glory.  The hardships indured during thr Battle of the Atlantic in 1941 shows the Germans still had the upperhand although the arrival of ASDEC radar soon sees a duel with a British destroyer.  <br />As this is the movie version, alot of cutting out was done but not to the detriment of the storyline.<br />The six years needed to make this film would probibly take three years with todays technology and with the benefit of CGI, the model ships and sets could be expended. This would really enhance this movie's appeal.<br />Naturally you get to choose the language you wish to hear dialogue, and although the whole cast came back in 1990 to re-read in English, setting the option of German with english subtitles is the only way to view this masterpiece.  The sound will still blow you away...U571, I don't think so!
B000005S6B|5.0|This is the grand-daddy of them all: Flogging Molly, Dropkick Murphys, Tossers, Black 47, etc. etc. I especially encourage younger listeners to pick up a copy of this disc. The collection of tunes represents The Pogues at their musical and creative peak in my opinion. From the title track till the end, you are served a great meal of pseudo-punk and traditional celtic influenced music.<br />Buy this disc. Pour a Guinness. Strap yourself into your recliner. Turn on this CD and save your soul.
B00006690G|3.0|Eminem is okay. If he wasn't white he wouldn't be famous, case closed. It's a fact. But the Eminem Show is my favorite Eminem album. That said, it isn't amazing. This doesn't touch Illmatic, Ready To Die, All of Tupac's albums..etc. Yeah Em is one of the better MCs out now (that's because most of them suck), but he's not the greatest, and this album doesn't deserve all the hype it got. It's good, but not great. <br />There's some good tracks:<BR>- Cleaning out my Closet (best song on the album)<BR>- Business <BR>- My Dad's Gone Crazy (Only b/c the hook is nice)<BR>- Sing for the Moment<br />There's some bad tracks:<BR>- Without Me (terrible!)<BR>- Drips<BR>- Hailie's Song<BR>- White America<br />So I'd say half the CD is good, half is bad. If you are white, need anger management, hate pretty much everyone you know, like to make fun of people, hate Mariah, Ja Rule, or Benzino, you'll like this album &amp; you will be able to relate to it. <br />I'd buy the good songs off itunes or download it off kazaa because it's not worth 15 dollars.
B000002LCI|4.0|I always thought this was, cover art and title-wise, the most cleverly artistic of all the Depeche Mode albums. Consider, after all, the thought of Emergency Warning Sirens as the creator of Music For The Masses; when they played, everyone listened. They \\"danced\\" in a peculiar dark way as well, if you'd consider the mass hustle to a shelter a motion of mass dancing. But in just that one picture and image, Depeche Mode caught their essence perfectly. Sounds that could attract attention and instill dread, curiosity and moving bodies.<br />\\"Music For The Masses\\" was a step more poppish than \\"Black Celebration,\\" but then, how could it not be? \\"Black Celebration\\" is DM's darkest hour, and the rejuvenated focus on dance beats lifted the sound of \\"Masses.\\" On the other hand, the songs of sexual dominance and submission (\\"Strangelove\\" and \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\"), sexual confusion (\\"Little 15\\" and \\"Behind The Wheel\\") and religion (\\"Sacred\\" and \\"To Have and to Hold\\") are just as strong as any the band has previously explored, even if they are more hooky and you can find yourself singing along.<br />I must also say I've always been put off by the CD's \\"Bonus tracks.\\" I've always viewed them as a distraction from my original album version (Yes, I had this on a long player once!) \\"Agent Orange\\" and the remix of \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" are the kind of annoyances that you don't mind on a CD single, but aren't the kind of material that stands the test of time in an album format. Perhaps someday when Rhino gives us the inevitable remastered reissues, they will treat DM like they did Elvis Costello and relegate the singles and B's to a second disc. One can hope.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|The main complaint people seem to have about Master and Commander is that, in effect, there aren't enough explosions.  Indeed, if you're looking for a hands-down action movie with flying wood and bullets every which way and a battle every five minutes, you'll probably be disappointed with M&C.  But it's that very lack of brainless violence and \\"cool action\\" that makes this movie stand out.  <br />It's rare to see an action movie with such fully developed characters, and Peter Weir could well have limited the characters in favor of more action, which would no doubt have boosted the box office.  But the characters are what do it for this movie: the attention spent on the nuances in the friendship between Aubrey and Maturin, the way even children must develop to the \\"grown-up\\" conditions of naval life, the way the seamen react to their captain's executive decisions, sometimes leading to the deaths of their companions.  If this film was more concerned with an intricate and action-filled plot, not only would it be untrue to the books on which it's based, but it would sacrifice what Weir and Patrick O'Brien himself believed to be most important.<br />In short, if you go into this movie expecting \\"Braveheart\\" or \\"Horation Hornblower,\\" you probably won't like it.  But if your expectations for character development are high, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
0671027344|5.0|This book is amazing. It is my favorite book for about a year, mainly because I haven't read anything that can top it yet. <BR>I heard about this book through the internet. My friends always went on about it and I was always seeing quotes and pictures from it.. etc. I was again, searching for something to read that would hold my interest, and I just happened to think of this. I ordered it on Amazon.com, got it a week later, and finished it that night. I couldn't believe how great it was. <br />In a way, I guess you could say that the book changed my outlook on life. I don't know the exact reason how or why.. but it did. I started thinking differently and doing things differently, getting into different things (writing, music.. etc.) and spending more time with my friends. Before all this I was as antisocial as they come. I hated leaving the house and I didn't WANT any friends. I guess after reading about Charlie and Patrick and Sam, and participating.. I decided to value my friends more, (or work to find a friendship like Charlie's and Patrick's and Sam's) and try to participate. And I guess it worked. But that's not the point.<br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a great book. Maybe it will change YOUR life. You won't know until you read it. Thanks to the guy who suggested that other book, The Losers Club by Richard Perez, another enjoyable little novel that got under my skin.
0671027344|1.0|This book is pure garbage. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is for all of the dumb, rich, suburban kids who think the worst pain in the world is being dumped by a crush. Do not think you are intelligent if you read this book. I also am disgusted by the people who say this book is a classic, the classics are Catch-22, Brave New World, any book that send an important social message. So burn this wretched book and actually go expand your horizen of knowledge.<br />P.S. Some people say this book is for liberals, well I'm a liberal my self (and I mean true liberal, not Democratic party liberal) and even though it writes about liberal topics, it does not mean it is going to appeal to liberals. In fact, from the people I see reading it, it seems to mostly appeal to conservatives, who know very little on the subjects.
6304935811|5.0|While there are many historical inaccuracies in this movie, it does a fabulous job of portraying both Gen Patton and WWII.   I saw this movie when I was fourteen and have never seen a movie that could surpass it.  Patton was a very complicated person and the movie does not portray what a complex person he was, it was simply impossible in three hours. The best theatrical performance of all time!
0553582453|5.0|A middle book?!  A boring book?!  These things I have read in others' reviews of this book, and have left me flabbergasted!<br />I have never read a Robin Hobb book before, nor have I had much luck before with reading fantasy novels.  But this book, I could not put it down!  For two nights, I got little to no sleep...  It is a rare thing to find in fantasy novels: such intrigue and deceit that could compare to castle courts of the Renaissance and Middle Ages, yet such an imaginative and fanciful twist to it as well.  This book is written with a rich historical flair, but you can expect to find dragons and magic coursing through these pages.  The characters come to life, and you'll find yourself reading each chapter with fear and eager anticipation as you sympathize with these people you have come to know and love so well!  <br />Character development, yes...  If you are one of those people who need daring fights and bloody, smoking battlefields to be &quot;action&quot; enough for you, you might miss the mind-tangling subtlety of court intrigue.  Everyone is caught in a spiderweb, all the threads interconnecting and leading everywhere.  This book is definitely addictive, and definitely going to leave you running in circles, rethinking things over again and again!  A fantastic worth-while read!
0316666343|5.0|This book is really like no other book I've ever read. If you enjoy reading true crime, you might enjoy this novel. If you are a person who doesn't like reading grisly murder details, this book isn't for you. As a writer, I'd also recommend this book to other writers because of its uniqueness. Due to the graphic scenes of Susie's rape and murder, I recommend this book for ages 16 and up. There is also some light swearing here and there. <br />I put this book off for two years because of the hype that surrounded it. I did the same thing with the Harry Potter books and to this day I'm still on the third book because I'm taking my time and enjoying them. If you are like me and haven't read The Lovely Bones because of the buzz, don't wait much longer. The story is sad; but Susie Salmon's story is urgent. Alice Sebold does a wonderful job of telling a heartbreaking story not only of a death but also about a young life that touched many others. The Lovely Bones is a wonderful book! Another book I'd like to recommend is The Losers Club by Richard Perez, a short little personal novel that got under my skin.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Thanks to my dad I've always liked Pink Floyd growing up, but I've never payed attention until now.  This disc alone inspired me to revamp my HT system to support it's awesome sound.  The clarity and richness of each channel deserves more than the standard theatre-in-a-box solution.  Guthrie did an amazing job crafting a premier example of the power of multichannel SACD.  I would suggest everyone who hasn't heard this updated masterpiece to venture on down to their local Hi-Fi retailer for a listen.  I have no doubt you'll be hooked.
B0001932ZA|4.0|Of all Arnold's mid-'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man. A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently, Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one isn't more controversial as the last, it's a dud. How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man? How long before we have 'court-appointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the Justice Department? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows.<br />The biggest message of all is 'You are being lied to'. It's no secret that the Government and the media work in cahoots. And the masses believe what the media tells them to believe. It's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the Running Man in the near future. It's no secret that Reality TV is not very realistic. It's edited and reshaped before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see. Usually it's far from the real truth.<br />Although rather different than Stephen King's book (the ending is completely changed) the script does conform to the typical Arnie formula. Yes, he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say 'I'll be back' (which he never REALLY said that often anyway, when you think about it) in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren would have been (these two were considered BEFORE Arnie believe it or not).<br />The director is none other than Dave Starsky himself (Paul Michael Glaser). It may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look. Andrew Davis (not a director I particularly like) was attached before Glaser, though no matter who directs, the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel.<br />First of all, Harold Faltermeyer's score (remember him?) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity. And the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future. Apart from the dated feel, the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.<br />This new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release. Gone is the horrid letterbox picture. In its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing. There constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. Definitely one of the best re-masters I've seen so far. Two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a 'Meet the Stalkers' gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look.

B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is amazing!!! With all this pop and punk out there, completely soiling the airwaves, Audioslave is exactly what we need. Tom Morello of Rage still has his it in him. His riffs sound sort of clasic rock. His solos are creative and interesting, not just the classic shred-notes-as-fast-as-possible solos. And of course, Chris Cornell is still a god of rock. His voice is as good as it ever was in the soundgarden days although calmed down a little. Not quite as much of the top-of-the-lungs screaming, although there is still a little of that.<br />Do yourself a HUGE favor and pick this album up. I love it and have never met a person who doesn't like it. Rock and roll, it will survive!!!!!!!!!!
0451169514|5.0|This was one of the most frightening books I have read.  There were nights I went to sleep with my door open so light could pour in.  From the beginning the horror and suspense build.  After some passages I would put down the book and think about what I had just read.  The thought was, &quot;This is some scary stuff.&quot;  Most of the scenes with Pennywise are just mind boggling.  When Ben is back in the library after the reunion, that was incredible.  Even the beginning with George, the whole book was great.<br />This novel is about some power or supernatural being that dwells in Derry.  This being is evil and feeds on humans, mainly children, and then it sleeps.  A group of friends hurt It 27 years ago, but It has returned.  They must find a way to hurt or kill It again.  But the magic of a group of children has been lost, and It is prepared for them.<br />The way Stephen King writes characters is amazing.  He brings you into the mind of Beverly's husband Tom, and he recreates the minds of children better than anyone else I have read.  Maybe it is the way he writes characters that makes It so good, but whatever he did in making this novel, it is amazing.

B00015YVDG|1.0|While I think the movie is great, I thought everyone should be warned that this is the exact same non-anamorphic transfer as the previous release. Amazon's technical details are in error. The back is absent of any 16x9 markings. Popping the movie in confirmed this. Stay away if you're looking to upgrade from the first disc.
B000000OF6|4.0|It is so hard to imagine Greatest Hits records these days. They all seem to be anticipated very well at first, but they all seem to lack a lot of great songs in the process. It just never ends. Even some of the greatest Rock N' Roll bands also have that problem. That comes with the case of Queen. Although Freddie Mercury died several years ago, his feeling for what Pop music is in the industry, was more imaginitive and creative than anything that has ever come out. Still, there are a whole amount of people who want to cash in on Queen. Recently, Britney Spears, Pink, and Beyonce Knowles conjured their version of We Will Rock You for a Pepsi commercial, which was the worst remake ever, considering they don't have what Queen had, a legacy.<br />Queen Greatest Hits 1 & 2, released in 1994, was a combination plate of the first two Queen hits collections. The songs that Roger Taylor, Freddie Mercury, John Deacon, and Roger Taylor created were all their own. The legacy Queen made is truly felt right here. The first disc contained hits from their days in the 70's and early 80's. The songs include a wide amount of hits including operatic classics Bohemian Rhapsody, Bicycle Race, and Somebody To Love, as well as classic Rock anthems like We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions. The songs range here so well by Queen from Rock, R&B, Dance, Opera, and much more.<br />The second disc is where their popularity failed in the U.S. during the 80's, but still recieved massive airplay in Europe. The songs here are also widely recieved including Radio Ga Ga, The upbeat Invisible Man, Under Pressure with David Bowie, the dramatic Innuendo, and one of their most covered classics The Show Must Go On. The only dissapointment with this collection, is that a vast amount of songs here could've been added, including live performances, and songs like Tie Your Mother Down. Largely considering, the first disc was much shorther than the second one in the process.<br />Considering with this collection, a lot of fans might be torn into 2 different directions. In 2002, the colection was reissued with the Greatest Hits Volume 3. Another factor is that both collections are about the same price too. If you can't find this collection, get The Platinum Collection instead. It is one of the best Greatest Hits collections out there.ction, a lot of fans might be torn into 2 different directions.

B000003C5C|5.0|This album is amazing. It came out when I was a senior in high school back in 1988-89. It left my jaw hitting the floor and it still does to this day. The songs are all memorable and catchy with great riffs and killer leads from both Chuck and whammy bar master Rick. If you don't own this album you must buy it. You will not be disappointed. Death was and is one of the greatest death metal bands of all times. Chuck you are missed. You were an inspiration to all of us. LONG LIVE DEATH !!!!!!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|all the songs from this album is really interesting and somehow touches me. All songs are brilliant. i love almost all of the songs that includes in this superb album. I read the review from the rolling stone and i exactly not satisfied and not agreeing that this album is so depressive. The songs from this album has its own unique blending of great music, lyrics are fine and the tunes and melodies is definitely awesome. i recommend this album very much. For me this album definitely a must cd.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is a very subtle movie and gets better each time it is viewed as Jane Austins books become so as they are reread. The actors are incredible. Emma Thompson's sister plays Mary. She is a wonder.All the acting is engaging and I recommend this movie be watched at least twice to catch all the levels and details.
B00005JLTN|5.0|I was surprised to see the amount of negative feedback this film recieved. This is personally the best movie out of the three. &quot;Reloaded&quot; offers a whole new perspective on the Matrix world. It shows that there is so much more to the Matrix then just a program to keep humans in check. &quot;Reloaded&quot; presents rogue programs that use the Matrix to their own personal pleasures (The &quot;French man&quot;), and also builds on other characters such as a virus the is spreading to every other program (Agent Smith), not the mention the Oracle, Seriph, and a host of others. <BR> <BR> I come to learn that people that hate his movie, don't understand it. I'm not talking about understanding the plot, I'm talking about understanding the vision of the creators. I used dislike this movie as well, that's becuase at first I did not understand what the creators wanted, but after repeated viewing I've come to love this film. If you expect answers from any of the movies, your wrong becuase the movies only bring up more questions. I see this as an opprotunity instead of a downfall in the movies. <br />The directors left the viewers with the abilty to make their own threories up. None of them can be called right or wrong, just different. Most people are upset becuase the Matrix movies didn't solve any of the questions, but that is understandable. The directors invented a completely original fantasy world in the Matrix movies and they left us the viewers to make all the decisions on what happened. The mystery surrounding these movies are what make them so appealing.<br /> I'll be objective here, this movie isn't perfect. Yes some scenes are too long and irrelevent, like the whole Zion dance scene. But how many movies out there have overlogged scenes that seem rather irrelevent? Almost every movie I have seen has atleast one scene that seems irrelevent and too long. I'm not going to give this movie 1 or 2 stars just cause of 1 bad scene. Also, the Twins were 2 great characters which were killed off to early, and too easily considering the awsome powers they possessed. The acting was subpar yes, but what do u expect with Reeves playing the lead role, I didn't watch his movie for the acting.<br />But what this movie lacks it more the makes up with the army of Smiths fight scene, the best car chase scene in the history of movies, and the killer &quot;Chateau&quot; fight scene. The characters still look bad-ass as hell, and the music perfectly compliments this film.<br /> You CAN NOT turn off your brain for this movie. This movie required thought because it doesn't answer any questions, you have to do it yourself. When you watch this movie, you have to be open to every posibilty. Most people are used to being force-feed the plot like a little infant, Matrix offers a mature audience the opprotunity to expand their minds by creating their own decisions on the characters.<br /> If you are ready for this movie, you'll give it 5 stars. If you aren't ready for this movie, or are just too ignorant to understand it, you'll give it 1 or 2 stars.<BR> <BR> Don't watch this movie expecting Oscar quality acting because that's not what the creaters were striving for. Don't watch this movie expecting everything to fall in place at the end. Above all, don't watch this film with a closed mind.<br />I applaud the Wachowski brothers for creating a truely great and original series of movies. Too much work, time, and effort went into this movie to say it was made to bring in more money. The Wachowski brothers creating something special here that most people just do not understand.

0553296981|5.0|Before I read Anne Frank's famous diary of her experiences in 1942-1944 as a Jewish teenager hiding in Amsterdam, I wondered if it was so well-known because it was well-written, or because it served as a compelling historical document of a difficult time and place. After reading it I can say that, for me at least, it is both.<br />Anne's story has so many elements. It is largely the story of herself, a developing, maturing teenager, and the people she interacts with on a daily basis. But as the Nazis take over and she is forced to go into hiding with her family, there is a sharp feeling of change. It is still her story, a very personal story. And yet, permeating her story at every point is this sense of something very dangerous all around, constantly threatening to encroach. We already know most or all of what the Nazis did as they occupied much of Europe, but Anne's diary is a historical document in the sense that it provides a unique, deeply personal perspective on how that time effected a very few people. Some people wil say that history is mainly told in the big events, but I disagree. History means little if we can't see how it effects even the most unlikely, otherwise unknown people. In reading Anne's diary, I could see history's effect on the individual more clearly than ever before.<br />And yet her writing itself is quite good as well. It's fairly good when the diary begins, with her at age 13. It is even better when it ends, shortly after she turns 15. She had a talent for description and an eye for detail that is rare in any writer, and she was very honest in her feelings, opinions, and experiences. We get her impressions of the Germans and the occupation, of course, but we also get the stories of her squabbles with her family and with the other members of the \\"Secret Annex.\\" We get the stories of arrests and raids, but also the story of Anne's impending menstruation and developing sense of sexuality. We hear about food shortages, but also about what she learned during her stay in the Annex, academically and otherwise.<br />In the end, reading Anne's diary feels wrong in a way, because it is the very personal thoughts of a young girl who is struggling to express herself, and confiding in a receiver who was never meant to be a real person. And yet, now millions have read her thoughts. It is -- I can't stress this enough -- a story of a maturing teenager. In a sense, it could be the story of my babysitter, or even eventually of my own daughters a few years down the road. However, it is also a story told under circumstances that would make most teenagers (and adults) cower in fear. The fact that Anne had the presence of mind and the strength and the courage to write down this document makes this one of the most important diaries ever written.<br />I won't soon forget it.learned during her stay in the Annex, academically and otherwise.<br />In the end, reading Anne's diary feels wrong in a way, because it is the very personal thoughts of a young girl who is struggling to express herself, and confiding in a receiver who was never meant to be a real person.

B000002UYZ|5.0|This may not mean anything to anyone outside the U.K, but when Alan Patridge named his favorite beatles album he said &quot;The Best of the Beatles&quot; and this is just that, or as close as we have to it as you can't fit all The Beatles best on one (or two) cd's.<BR>Firsty, I see people are moaning this is 2 CD's when it can be fitted onto one. Why do people bother? Do people really think EMI will charge less for this set if it was only on one cd? Of course they wouldn't. They'd still have to pay the same publshing costs and other royalties. All this would do would have them a dime (about 6p to us English) for the cost of the [plastic/metal used to make the 2nd CD.... so you'd be paying the same anyway!<BR>Now this is a little pricey but if you don't own any Beatles albums and don't want to fork out for all their CD's, this, along with &quot;1967-70&quot; (the one with the Blue cover) is for you.<BR>This set, titled &quot;1962-66&quot; is the best of &quot;The Early Beatles&quot; and contains all their fabulous singles from that time as well as some great albums cuts!
0446530891|4.0|I briefly scanned the 90 reviews and what I found was either 1) readers loved this book or 2) they hated it because they couldn't remember the characters involved.  I'll try not to be to harsh to the latter group, but I was able to follow along and thought that Baldacci did a great job keeping me from accurately guessing who the bad guys were.  Enjoy the book!!

B0001611DI|4.0|The 1978 &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; should have been left alone.  If they wanted new audiences to see it, they should have re-released it in theaters instead of re-make it.  The 2004 &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; just doesn't cut it.  It starts really promising and goes downhill after about thirty minutes into the movie.  First, whether the film wants to be or not, it is a continuation after &quot;Night&quot;, but doesn't really acknowledge that.  In the opening scenes characters are talking about getting the weekend off from work as if they are completely oblivious to the massive epidemic effecting the entire world.  Basically, it should have started like the original -- right in your face.  But nonetheless its opening scenes are still solid, but not realistic at all in the sense of the situation.  I don't think I'd give a crap if I get the weekend off from work because the harsh reality of the situation is if such an epidemic was actually occuring the enitire world would be aware in a few short hours.  Second, you only get one brief glimpse of a zombie eating a victim during the early scenes when they are in the mall.  That's all you get.  All the other zombie attack scenes are them biting their victims to death.  You might be led to believe that is all the zombies do -- bite you until you die and join them, not eat you.  You have to survive the bite to be one of them and die later from the infection.  Zombies don't care if you join them or not, but they do want to eat you.  Third, in &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; it was established that the zombies will eat animals.  The scene where the dog carries food across the parking lot unmolested contradicts that.  Fourth, the main character's (I forget her name) husband dies at the beginning of the movie and attacks her immediately.  Later on we see her tending to the wound of a bite victim who dies.  She gets way too close as if she completely forgot what happened to her husband.  The movie tries to cover this flaw by covering it with a scene later on where the charcter is asked if she's sure bite wounds are incurable and if the victim will join the undead.  It's a good try, but still the character just looks stupid getting that close because she should already have that information.  Fifth, the zombies run damn fast.  Zombies don't run -- this isn't one of those stupid &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot; movies, but that one flaw alone cuts it too close.  I realize in a remake they have to change things otherwise there is no point of remaking it.  But what this movie ultimately turns out to be is a re-make of the recent &quot;28 Days Later&quot;.  That's really all it is.  This movie shouldn't have even been billed as a &quot;Dawn&quot; remake.  All they'd have to do is lose the shopping mall, don't barricade themselves in a farm house, and don't hide underground and volia! there you have it, a much better &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and that is all I can give this movie credit for -- a better &quot;28 Days Later&quot;.  So the remake gets ** while the recent &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; DVD re-release gets ****.  An extra * would have been given if there was a behind the scenes featurette, but sadly there isn't.

B0000VAFO0|1.0|If I can think of one movie that I HATE, it is &quot;Underworld&quot;.  I was so excited to see the battle of the vampires &amp; werewolves, and laughed through this whole movie.  I HATED HATED HATED this movie.  The costumes were apparently borrowed from the Warner Bros vault when &quot;The Matrix&quot; was through with them.  I didn't know vampires suddenly have reflections in mirrors (one female is looking in a mirror deciding which dress to wear and has a reflection!).   Who is paying for the online account and cellphones that the vamps use????  Do they send the bill to the LAIR BELOW THE STREETS!!!?????  What's up with that????  Dark, dreary, depressing, horrible acting, horrible script, clothes from a better movie, sets from &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentleman&quot;.  Skip it.  Send it back to the Underworld and get it out of ours.
1582432678|5.0|I originally decided to read this book because I have found myself morbidly fascinated by the violent behavior growing exponentially among the young people of this country.  I have raised two children, now adults, who managed to grow up as loving, compassionate young women.  This book appealed to me because it appeared to address what makes these violent youth tick.  Make no mistake - this is not some remake of &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;, although Kevin, the young man who commits unspeakable violence, seems to fit that description.  The book's style is so unique, written as letters from Kevin's mother Eva to her ex-husband Franklin, in journal form, allowing the reader to view her innermost thoughts and feelings.  It gives this book a deeply personal feel to it.  The story is about an unremarkable upper-middle class couple who, after agonizing over the issue, finally decide to have a child.  From the very beginning, Eva has a difficult time connecting with Kevin, while Franklin sees him as his little man who can do no wrong.  As he grows older, Kevin becomes more and more strange and frightening, and the horrible events that unfold are inevitable.  The temptation is to think that Kevin's behavior and almost evil personality is exaggerated for literary effect.  But one only needs to read a basic primer on the psychopathic personality to know that, whether we like or not, people like Kevin DO exist, and they often come from normal and happy families. They don't have horns on their heads or a sign on their foreheads that says &quot;I am going to kill someone&quot;. Certainly Eva does not present herself or Franklin as perfect parents, but rather is brutally honest about their shortcomings.  Still, one would never assume that they would raise a rage-filled, violent child. Kevin scares us so much because his upbringing is, if not perfect, at least very normal.  His behavior comes from beyond external influences. I firmly believe that some people are evil from conception.Studies have shown differences in brain chemistry among psychopaths.  Although this book is fiction, it is based in fact, and although it is society's habit to heap blame on parents for the bad acts of their children, it is blame placed unfairly. This book will frighten and disturb, but it is blade-sharp in its brutal honesty and accuracy.  No one wants to believe in &quot;bad seeds&quot;, but they are there, and this book makes this fact impossible to ignore. I couldn't put it down, and I doubt most readers will be able to either.
B000002J03|5.0|In 1969 Zeppelin got the ball running with the release of their first album in January. 9 months later Led Zep released their second album Led Zeppelin II. From the opening cough of Whole Lotta Love to the ending harmonica on Bring It On Home this album is great, one of zep's best. This album showcases each member of the band at their best. Led Zeppelin II is best identified as electric blues rock to a lesser extent than on their first album. Due to the fact they were on tour while they were recording this album the overall sound is more raw and less bluesy than Led Zeppelin I. Whole Lotta love is the biggest hit off the album, reaching #4 on the charts in Oct. 69. It is one of the heaviest rcoking songs on the album with a dark, experimental middle section with Jimmy Page screeching his theremin to create the sound of an audio orgasm. What Is and What Should Never Be is a slow paced song and then explodes at the end. Its got good slide guitar from Page. Ramble On is a Lord Of The Rings oriented song with more of an acoustic edge than some of the other songs on the album. The Lemon Song showcases Robert Plant's vocal talents as he shrieks and screeches. Possibly one of the heaviest, if not the heaviest song on the album is Heartbreaker. With pounding drums from John Bonham, relentless riffs form Page and great vocals from Plants you literally get the definintion of a rock and roll song. Halfway through it Page breaks out one of his best solos, which builds up power until the song turns into a loud, raunchy jam. Heartbreaker flows right into Livin Lovin Maid, which is a short catchy pop song. If you think this album is just electric blues then you are sadly mistaken. Thank You is a soft yet powerful ballad which Robert dedicates to his wife Maureen. It showcases how zep can be loud and heavy as well as ballad like, quiet, and very diverse. John Bonham gets his dues on Moby Dick, which showcases him using his talent and unique drumming abilities. At one point he putsdown his sticks and starts playing with his hands across the tom toms. This version is 4:21 minutes long but when played live this song could go up to a half hour in length! Last but not least is Bring It On Home. It starts out as a quiet blues song and then explodes into a fast paced electric jam. At the end of the song it becomes quiet again and stops with the signiture harmonica end to a blues song. Blues obviously dominates this album less than Led Zeppelin I and in 1970 Zeppelin switch into a more acoustic, folk based direction. Led Zeppelin II is a good place to start if you want to get into Zep's music as well as understand their roots.
B000088E6D|4.0|Michael Buble has a beautiful voice, and is the kind of talented singer you can listen to with complete confidence that he will never not hit a note and make you cringe. That said, this album is nice, but I feel lacking a certain &quot;oomph&quot; in each arrangement. Everything's a little too gentle and Michael's not packing a punch. There really is not one cover that I prefer to its original, particularly &quot;You'll Never Find,&quot; &quot;Summer Wind,&quot; and &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart.&quot; My overview, then, is that this is a nice compilation to have playing sort of in the background; nothing is offensive, and it's pleasant. But it does leave me with that feeling you might get when out on a date with a perfectly nice, attractive person with whom you have no chemistry. There is absolutely nothing wrong technically speaking, it's just lacking that certain spark. I'd like to hear more passion.
B00006JKOL|5.0|Minstrel in the Gallery is Jethro Tull's finest work, although it is unfortunately also one of the most underrated and underappreciated of their albums.  In my opinion, there is not one weak song on this album- every work here is a masterpiece, and a uniquely beautiful blend of English folk/acoustic styles with progressive and hard rock.  On no other album is this musical essence of Tull more apparent, although I definitely would recommend the following other great Tull albums as well: Songs From the Wood, Heavy Horses, Bursting Out (Live), Aqualung, Too Old To Rock and Roll, and This Was.  But you MUST check out Minstrel in the Gallery, and please ignore all the critics who somehow miss all the incredible musical brilliance that exists on this record.
B000002BBY|1.0|Oasis's \\"Brit-pop\\" sound that was a major part of Australian radio during the 1990s was then considered to be a different form of alternative rock from the American grunge that took over the music world very suddenly with the arrival of [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]] in 1991.<br /><br />Whilst there is a lot to be said against the pompous hair-metal of the 1980s, this does not excuse the total lack of melody and resultant bluntness of grunge.<br /><br />As for Oasis, they gave themselves a different image to grunge, yes, but there is no means by which one can say they failed to dissociate themselves from grunge. For the most part, the songs on \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\" use grunge distortion patterns that are copied with only the faintest of disguises, as on the last part of the otherwise pleasant pop tune \\"Champagne Supernova\\", which sounds nothing like 60s music as many say it does. Rather, it sound like a soppy version of grunge that retains all the horrible noise. The string-laden ballad \\"Wonderwall\\" copied this noisy character from early 1990s grunge in exactly the same way: the embellishments give no disguise.<br /><br />On the rockers, the band is even less tuneful: \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" really sounded like a half-hearted attempt to imitate My Bloody Valentine - there were traces of that dense melody - but was muffled and awful as a song. The rest of the album moved along a similar, totally slushy, mid-tempo vein that showed Oasis simply were a soggy version of (awful) 1990s grunge.<br /><br />If you think you will get something different from American alternative rock of the 1990s, you will be utterly disappointed by \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\". For fans, at most.

0385504209|4.0|I just finished the book and have to say it was a real page-turner.  That being said, I also kept getting the sense that I was reading the script for a movie.  The suspense is definitely there but reality was really being stretched as the story unfolded.  Some of it also tended to be predictable.  I figured out the text under the rose on the box immediately and ran to my bathroom mirror to decipher it before reading on.  Brown definitely has done a lot of research on the subjects of the Holy Grail, Mary Magdalen, Opus Dei, and the Vatican and has used the information well to write this fast-paced book.  But it seems too incredible to believe that all of this story and all the coincidences could fall successfully into place in a 24-hour period.  Would I recommend the book? Yes, absolutely.  If for no other reason than to pique your interest into finding out more about the Holy Grail, Mary Magdalen, Opus Dei, etc.  The Truth is Out There....
0380002930|5.0|It is heartwarming (in the extreme for me) to see so many glowing and informative reviews about this incredible book.<br />I read Watership Down when I was in junior high and remembered liking it very much.  Then life got busy and I pretty much forgot about it.  But occasionally I'd see it on the bookshelves at my local library or bookstore and an itch would start in the back of my mind, telling me that I should revisit its magical pages.  So this Winter, I did . . .<br />How wonderful it is to visit such a fully realized world created by the human mind, but set in an anthropomorphic background (and foreground, too!).<br />The story is about a band of rabbits---Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, Dandelion, and Bluebell---who set off from their comfy holes to find a new rabbit warren on the plains of Watership Down.  They leave their original warren because Fiver (a small, brooding rabbit with 'The Sight') has a vision of it being destroyed.  Not surprisingly, soon after they leave, they find out that the warren HAD been destroyed by big hrududil (tractors) that dug up the ground and killed all those who remained behind.<br />The trials and tribulations of Hazel and his band of rogue rabbits carries the story along at a leisurely pace, not rushing to get the story out, giving rabbit history and mythology a few well-deserved pages, too.<br />After Hazel and his fellow bunnies set up their new warren on Watership Down, though, they find that they have a serious problem: no does (females)!  Without does, their new warren is doomed to failure, so they set about trying to locate some breeding stock.  But what they encounter is a terrible warren known as Efrafa run by the overbearing and callous General Woundwort.  The battle between Watership Down and Efrafa is terrible and exciting reading, even for adults.<br />One other thing that struck me about reading this book (even years later) is that there are so many things discussed in it  of an adult nature; rabbit miscarriages, battles, sexual connotations, death and dying, all are covered within these simple pages.  And it's done so effortlessly (thank you Mr. Adams), the story's flow is NEVER interrupted.<br />This book was first published in 1972 (a limited release no less) in England; the publisher wasn't sure if it would be well received since it really wasn't a children's tale, nor adult literature.  Thank GOD they took a chance on it.  If they hadn't, we would surely have been denied a true literary classic.<br />A+ rating.attles, sexual connotations, death and dying, all are covered within these simple pages.

B00005YU1O|5.0|It is not like anything I have ever seen. Very witty.<BR>Very original both in content and form -great graphic work.<BR>Still I recognize that this is very peculiar. Hate it or love it kind of thing.<BR>If you are bored of all these movies that look the same, if you like to think, to wonder, if you are fascinated by day/nightdreaming...you'll probably love it.<BR>But if you want a movie with a clearly structured and foreseable plot, if you want to laugh or cry or enjoy a movie without thinking -which is fine here and there-don't buy this.<BR>To undergo the intented brain revolution you need to watch this movie carefully, not just sit in front of a screen .
B00005K3O4|3.0|I really don't know how to rate this movie, as it is an odd mix of cheesy, dorky stupidity and wild, demented genius.  As you no doubt already know, it chronicles the invasion of a small town by sinister clown-like creatures from another planet. Local teens try to warn the authorities, but the mean police chief won't listen....  as one of the Chiodo brothers says in a commentary, the storyline borrows heavily from that 1958 classic, &quot;The Blob.&quot;<br />But that barely begins to describe &quot;Killer Klowns.&quot;  Clearly, it's a parody of 1950s sci-fi/horror movies, but it's more than that.  It's ...  well, it's Killer Klowns from Outer Space. A one-of-a-kind effort that defies easy categorization.<br />The acting ranges from good to awful (John Vernon steals the show as Officer Mooney) and the sets are often no better than you'd see in a community theatre production. Photography is surprisingly good. The soundtrack is fun, in a 1980s way.<br />I really enjoyed this movie, but I can't give it more than 3 stars because it's so cheaply produced, and the acting is just AWFUL in  places. Buy or rent a copy, get together with some friends, some pizza, and beer and enjoy it for what it is: a wild, weird exercise in goofy humor.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I am not a \\"Holy-Roller\\" like many people may think you are after buying this CD.  Since the movie was so powerful, I needed to get the soundtrack so I could listen to it whenever I wanted without having to sit in one spot.  This is an amazing CD that makes you remember how truly awesome the movie was.  It makes you feel good to think that a CD like this can change the way you feel when you listen to it and that feeling carries with you throughout the day.  I think everyone who has seem the movie and was moved by it, should get this CD, because it will do the same.  This is not the music of today, which is a VERY good thing.  This is the most amazing collaboration I own,and I don't buy this genre of music - ever!  I love it and am positive you will too.
B00008S7ZW|5.0|Saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out and i thought it was great... jennifer did a outstanding performance... seems simpleton minds like Monkeytot are the only twit's here... he can't seem to tell between fantasy and reality like the character in Catcher in the Rye... let me tell you a little secret Monkeytot about this movie and most movies in general... Jennifer didnt write the script nor that line you mentioned... she didnt make up the line neither it was someone else's work... not everyone in the U.S. much less the world has read Catcher in the Rye and thats what they were showing in that scene with Justine.. that she is a simple girl from a small town who was never into reading till she met Holden (if your going to call anyone a twit wouldnt it be someone who names himself after a character in a book?)... so maybe you should watch the movie again Monkeytwit and &quot;think&quot; for once.. as for the movie to everyone else.. i give it 5 stars... and recommend it to anyone..
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I bought this after seeing the film a third time. This CD is a must-have for anyone who enjoyed the film The Passion of the Christ.<br />Each of the tracks are powerful experiences, but some key tracks include: &quot;Mary Goes To Jesus&quot;, &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, &quot;Raising the Cross&quot;, and &quot;Ressurection&quot;.<br />Overall, the CD is excellent and wonderous to behold.
6303407188|4.0|This is Tim Burton saying that no matter how many people don't care about B-horror pictures, he does, and showing us that there can be poetry in them. \\"Ed Wood\\" is a bio-pic of real-life B-hollywood director Edward D Wood Jr, done in the style of one of his pictures - unexplained framing devices, like Criswell's introduction, noirish lighting for no apparent reason, and incidental performances by actors who look like they've just shown up and not been told what part they're supposed to be playing. These last, like the doctor in Lugosi's hospital, are provided for colour, but are an example of the balance struck in this picture. It has the expression of a comedy - yes, we're asked to laugh at Wood's haphazard way of making pictures, and we can laugh about how terrible the pictures are, but beneath the comedy a great truth is found, and a message Tim Burton is passionate about is expressed. The heart of Ed Wood is really in the character of \\"washed-up\\" Dracula star Bela Lugosi (played to a tee and rewarded with an Oscar, by Martin Landau).<br />Twenty years after Dracula, Lugosi's career was over. Nobody cared about him. It was like, as is Hollywood lore, you're only as good as the last thing you've done. And whatever classic roles or films you may have done, it all counts for nothing if you do a bad picture. This theme of the cruel way Hollywood forgets its greatest talents is also why the name Orson Welles keeps cropping up. Its not because Welles made pictures like Ed Wood's, its because, like with Lugosi, Welles's having made what is considered to be the greatest picture of all time, Citizen Kane, counted for nothing in Hollywood. If your pictures didn't make money, you were useless - so Hollywood did everything it could to keep him from working - RKO sabotaged his Ambersons, and eventually he could not get backing for many great pictures in Hollywood that, and here there is another analogy with Ed Wood, he raised money for himself and made independently. It is this determination to succeed, and persist in your work no matter what others think of it that makes Ed Wood (thanks to a terrific fun performance from Johnny Depp) such an important and admirable character. You can't help liking Ed, for his irrepressible spirit and optimism. It was Ed Wood who gave Lugosi another chance, the content of which Burton romanticises and focuses on in his film. Ed Wood cared about Lugosi's work - Wood didn't care about popular opinion which said Lugosi was \\"washed up,\\" whatever that meant. Wood had seen Dracula, and Lugosi was a legend, and that was all that mattered. Wood gave him the chance to be in pictures again, symbolising the appreciation of great works, not recent moneymakers. Burton and Martin Landau give the legend of Bela Lugosi his last great performance, turning him into the tragic figure to end all tragic figures. His performance of his \\"I have no home speech\\" set to stirring, haunting music, on the steps of the hospital - his performance of the infamous flower-smelling scene from Plan Nine from Outer Space, the last footage Lugosi ever shot - all have the tone of appreciating a legend, giving Lugosi his due, saying who gives a [woop] if Hollywood doesn't remember, we remember.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Just wished to say that being a bit into perverse likings lets hear it for agent Smifff!  Especially where there are more of him.<br />I reckon he is hilarious and that there ought to be a run off t.v. series like Stargate.  With Him losing all the time of course. I just love the cricking of the neck after or during a fight.  Seriously he is a great actor and in my opinion outshone Keenu Reeves who'es general expression (with the glasses off) seemed perpetually surprised and I'm only here for the beer?
6305075492|4.0|I just saw Caligari. I thoroughly recommend it!<br />Timothy Brock's score is the best score for a silent movie i've heard so far! Its such an authentic orchestral accompaniment that you can actually hear the breathing of the string players! Truly wonderful compared to the old organ or set classical or jazz music pieces which run alongside the movie instead of help tell its story. <br />And what an incredible movie. One of my favourite silents so far! An eye-opening experience. If you haven't seen much silent cinema, you'll be shocked at how involving a silent can be. Caligari takes you to another place. The world of Caligari has a feel all its own, where houses are wonky, doorways triangular, people ghoulish, and everything like something out of a nightmare. One of the best pieces of what they call german expressionism. See it!
B00018TI5E|5.0|John has come back very strong.  This, like all Frusciante albums, is aimed at his fans, not at RHCP fans or pop music fans.  That being said, if you come in with an open mind, you will be blown away.  His artistry is evident; the guitar continues to be masterful, and it's incredibly soulful music.
B000059XUO|4.0|The Crow opens with a voiceover reading this myth: &quot;People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it, and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back, to put the wrong things right.&quot;<br />The Crow is mythmaking at its best. Eric Draven (Lee) is brought back from the dead to avenge the rape and murder of his wife and his own murder. While filming the scene where his character is shot dead at the beginning of The Crow, in order to return to life as an immortal Jesus figure, the cap from the blank hit him and lodged in his spine, and Brandon Lee died. The way Lee's death on set at that particular moment fit into the myth of the movie is just as much to do with the cult status of this picture, as its fantastic gothic landscape, exciting story, gorgeous score and irresistable central figure.<br />Brandon Lee, being interviewed about The Crow, was asked about death and his character in the film. He said this:<br />&quot;Because we do not know when we will die we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. And yet everything happens only a certain number of times. And a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood. An afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it. Perhaps four or five times or more. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.&quot;<br />He died not long after. This was his last interview.
0385510438|4.0|I just finished reading this book and I cant understand why so many people gave it bad reviews. I thought it was an excellent book. Willie was great and all the characters of Ford county were interesting to say the least. Grisham once again shows how talented of a story teller he is. Who couldnt like Baggy, Harry Rex, Miss Callie and her huge family and everyone else. I felt this book to be just as good as Grishams other novels that I have read (The Brethren, The partner, The Last Testament, King of Torts, ect.). Once again Grisham delivers with your not so typical lawyer book, and does a great job. A small town feel with lots of drama I recommend this book to any Grisham fan.
B00005NB8K|4.0|Utterly absorbing bio-pic of Jim Morrison. The name Val Kilmer is, or should be, synonymous with incredible acting that is not merely natural or convincing, but immensely fun and commanding. You may have noticed while watching his recent Wonderland - Val has the ability to make a picture. Here, he IS The Doors: The Movie. There, he WAS Wonderland. I am exaggerating, i suppose. For Oliver Stone has crafted a marvellous film which makes you feel like you've experienced what the sixties were like. Through using The Doors actual music (what was missing from the recent Sylvia, the art of the subject itself - her poetry) to help tell its story and colour its scenes, and filmic techniques to create the drug-induced world vision of Jim Morrison, Stone really takes you into the world of his movie, and the world of the sixties.<br />This movie made me appreciate what an exciting experience The Doors were, and has actually cultivated love in me for their music. I didn't realise they had more than one classic: Light my Fire, The End, People are Strange, Love her Madly, Break on Through to the Other Side, Riders on the Storm, Touch Me, Roadhouse Blues (Let it roll, baby roll) and probably more i'm yet to discover.<br />For a better recreation of what Andy Warhol's factory actually felt like, see I Shot Andy Warhol. Crispin Glover actually looks more like Andy than the guy who plays him in &quot;I Shot,&quot; but the guy in I Shot much better captured Andy's vagueness and almost unconsciousness while in conversation. This, however, is but three minutes in the movie and has no effect on it as a whole.<br />Oliver Stone has an amusing cameo: a young film student, Jim Morrison, shows his short film to his class, who are uncouth and disparaging about it, after which camera pans to reveal Oliver Stone standing at the lecturn, (obviously, playing the film professor), who says: &quot;Why don't we ask the author what he thinks?&quot;
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in translation is a great piece of work depicting a simple plot layered over Japan. Two Americans find each other and create a friendship, although it may not have lasted long, it stays with them forever. For a lot of people this movie is either a hit or a miss, some people hate Japan, some people hate love stories but I loved it for its simplicity in expressing the sometimes miss understood emotion of love. Sofia Coppola well deserved the Oscar for best original screen play and personally, and Bill Murray should have won the Oscar for best actor. I urge you to see this movie even if you don't like romances, it gives you a new perspective on how frail but beautiful relationships should and can be.
B00004XPPB|4.0|First rate mafia drama connects on a deeper level than most. Its cinematography may not have the moody, noirish atmosphere that makes The Godfather so appealing, but despite its slick Hollywood look, it seems to attain such penetrating truth (this, perhaps, has a little to do with its being based on a book by the real life main character). The central situation of the aging mafia man taking under his confidence and vouching for an undercover FBI agent, and that a bond forms between the two men is a great one. The performances are absolutely superb. Particularly the two men who the story centres on, Joe Pistone, a.k.a Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp, going for realism in this role, is incredible. It begins and ends with a closeup of his eyes - this movie would be nothing without him) and mafia man &quot;Lefty&quot; (Pacino, who gives us one of his finest characterisations - best bit, his close-up after Donnie is asked to shake hands by a certain character on a certain boat). The vividness of the characters in this movie seems to owe a great deal to the superb screenplay (again, credit to the real-life source material). Recurring catch-phrases make it easy for us to get to know characters, a wonderful little touches give the story such a resonance, and make it ring true: like Lefty's smoking inside the car when driving with Brasco and accusing Brasco of trying to kill him with the draft when he opens a window to let some smoke out, and the portrait of Lefty, the opposite of how we imagine a mafia veteran, as a vulnerable, often emotional man.<br />Deserves at least four stars. Recommended to anyone (except, obviously kids, for a few scenes unsuitable to them).
B00005LMBK|5.0|I picked up this album as a bit of a joke, since I liked the &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; song.  I was surprised to find the entire album remarkably innovative and enjoyable. After dozens of listens, I have yet to grow weary of the tunes!  They are refreshing in their originality, and have a way of getting into your head.  I give it my highest recommendation, especially for those tired of the formula trash in the top 40.
B00005QCVY|5.0|A beautiful, moving movie. It takes you on the journey again every time you see it. Every scene is a classic. Jimmy Stewart is quite incredible in this movie. If you ever thought classical actors couldn't rival method actors, see how genuine Stewart's performance is. Two special moments: Stewart's tears as he sits in martinis, and the scene where Mary and George both listen to the same telephone receiver. Its such a magical scene - one of the best scenes of all time. Neither of them listen to what Sam Wainwright is saying on the phone, because all of a sudden the two of them realise they are standing the closest they've been together in twenty or so years. He can smell her hair and she can smell his aftershave. The scene is played out in expressions and movements, and you can read their thoughts on their faces. A joy.<br />This movie does a difficult thing, something we love to be reminded of each christmas, it makes you appreciate the important things in life. Its about falling back in love with life. Frank Capra was a master director. Not only are his movies brilliantly realised, perfectly shot and constructed, but they contain just enough awfulness to ensure that the endings do not seem corny - their positive messages do not seem contrived - they are a joy and a relief. Frank Capra doesn't pretend the world is a perfect place, but he does something many filmmakers can't - he actually provides answers as to how best to deal with the world's imperfect nature. If you're ever feeling sad and low, or too concerned with trivial things, watch Its a Wonderful Life.
0671027387|5.0|Dan brown is an excellent author.  DaVinci Code is one of my all-time favorite books.  Having said this, Deception Point is a very very close second.  Dan Brown's research is unmatched and as a result, his novels are almost as educational as they are fun to read!  And, just when you think you have this book figured out-surprise!  Buy this book along with one other book because you will probably finish Deception Point in a few days.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is an instant classic for all to enjoy. I have viewed this movie at least 10 times with my son and enjoy it every time. The digital remastering of this movie is also wonderful and I have friends who say the sound is amazing if you have a surround sound setup (which I dont have yet) If you are a Disney Collector or just looking for a great family movie, this is the one to get!
B00000JLWW|5.0|I love this movie. The special effects are stunning and the acting is awsome (espically Kate Winslet, Katy Bates, and Billy Zane). This movie will be forever a classic. I hope that a special edition DVD comes out because the DVD that is out has no special features! Highly Reccommended...

If he just stayed him self he might get mo' respect - stop hatin' on Jarule - cause he got sum mad skills you could neva have!!!    If Jarule was on AFterMath he would sell just as many records as 50 and Eminem - due to Dre's beats!!!     Tha 'in da club' beat is a classic!!!    Dont judge by tha image, judge tha music!  PEACE
B000003C4K|5.0|this is a thrash classic and it is what i call thrash metal,i once bought this along with testaments new order and overkils years of decay(i had a gift certificate if your wondering how couldve i afford it even when im always broke).the h-team is always has brilliant guitar playing and is brutally fast too,all songs i give are 5/5 except for metal command which is 4/5,the best song in the album is a lesson in violence.i heard that some people doesnt like pual baloffs vocals,yeah well those people are posers and trust me on that he sounds angry in this album.if paul baloff was still alive right now there would've been more music like this,but now that zetro has been back in the band are their new album tempo of the damned about come out soon.but when the album come out i know theres gonna be psycho,insane,kick... music in there.but bonded by blood is one of exoduses greatest albums yet to offer so all i can say is you should buy this or you can just die (sorry,i was under a lot of stress while i wrote this).
B000088E6D|5.0|****WOW!**** <br />Stunning and sexy. Bublé means smooth as satin songs! Those would be my news headlines!<br />This is an elaborate work of musical art that features the VOICE of the Future. Introduced to the Mike Bublé cd by way of the Juno 2004 compilation cd (which I thought was impressive in itself - Canadian talent is worldclass) I made my purchase after hearing Bublés Fever, and then taking a look and listen to the Bublé website.<br />My only disappointment with this cd is that there weren't another 10 (or 20 or 500) songs - I could listen to the Bublé velvet voice forever. Can't miss with this cd.

B0000TB01Y|3.0|After a summer of  great expectations, the dust has settled and Broadway's Fall/Winter 03-04 is definitely an example of the glass half-full.  Even if the projects seemed less than sum of their expensive and talented parts, several performances shone through with considerable power. Among them are the audacious puppets of AVENUE Q, the triple threat known as Hugh Jackman in THE BOY FROM OZ, the unforgettable Donna Murphy in a WONDERFUL TOWN and the dynamic duo of Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth in WICKED.<br />When the production made its tryout stop in San Francisco, I jumped at the chance to see such a major new work make its way East.  I will admit, I am not a fan of Gregory Maguire's book, which is a densely written experience that stopped me cold, despite its central conceit of being a revisionist Oz tale.  While I found much to enjoy in WICKED's musical book, the show does play like the novel's greatest hits, streamlining the narrative into a mainstream tale of girl power, friendship, careful social commentary and human comedy.  Writer Winnie Holtzman does a capable job, even if it lapses into shades of &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; angst.<br />The bigger admission is that I am not fond of Stephen Schwartz's musical canon, which I feel rests comfortably in the school of bad Disney ballads.  Also, for show that is often introspective and laden with darkly personal themes, the songs do little to illuminate the characters' journeys.<br />Nope, the real selling point are its leads and they are worth the visit and the purchase of this disc.<br />Menzel and Chenoweth elevate the show to the sky with a pair of performances that are truly breathaking.  Even their being handicapped by such pedestrian material like &quot;The Wizard and I,&quot; &quot;Popular&quot; and &quot;I'm Not that Girl&quot; still makes you want to listen the CD again.  Their combined vocal prowess makes the soon-to-be-sung at high schools forever finale &quot;For Good&quot; into one of the most touching ballads.  And Menzel gives plenty of defiant fire to the vocal defying &quot;Defying Gravity.&quot;<br />Menzel's performance as Elphaba (the future Wicked Witch of the West) comes across the strongest on disc given her share of power ballads, which she tears into with relish.  The sunnily comic flourish of  Chenoweth's stellar Galinda nee Glinda does suffer slightly without some of her fun speeches and timing.  But, she's in wonderful voice and both women preserve their roles with gusto and style.<br />You can't help but wish the musical as a whole was better -- but to view these women in action, as well as Joe Mantello's eye-popping production -- will make for a rousing evening of theater.<br />Fans of the show will consider this disc a wonderful souvenir.  Fans of musical theater beware, however.  Sight unseen, you may find this WICKED less than enchanting.  But once you take a listen to Menzel and Chenoweth,  you may just start planning your next trip to NYC and see why its lead stars have transformed WICKED into the only real hit musical of the year.he most touching ballads.

B00005Y23E|5.0|Legend (Deluxe Edition) is absolutely worth every penny. It is the #1 reggae album of all time because it was written and performed by Marley and the Wailers, who are all extremely talented. The same way that Miles Davis &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is a jazz album that even jazz haters enjoy, those of you familiar with reggae, even those of you with negative feelings about reggae, give it a try. My personal favorite song on the whole album is the extended version of &quot;One Love&quot;. Go for it, your music collection is dying for some Jamaica.
0689815816|5.0|If you're going to buy one book this year for a young child, you'd better make sure it's this one. `We're Going On A Bear Hunt' by Michael Rosen, is a children's adventure story that's guaranteed to leave you wondering at the end. What's the bear really like? Is it a good idea to go on a bear hunt? Maybe it's safer to stay at home in bed. If you did, maybe you wouldn't have such an exciting adventure!<BR> This story is about an optimistic family and their dog who are determined to search for a bear, despite the obstacles in their way. What happens when they finally meet the bear? You'll have to read it to find out!<BR> I recommend this brilliant story to parents and teachers of young children because, as well as being a fantastic read, it's a great book for teaching them about adjectives and prepositions: \\"A swirling whirling snowstorm. We can't go over it. We can't go under it. Oh no! We've got to go through it!\\" I also really like the illustrations by Helen Oxenbury because they help to tell the story and bring the characters to life. This is also one of my daughter's favourite bed-time stories. She's not scared...........<br />How about you?<br />Do you dare to find the bear?
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is a great album. It is still has the &quot;A Perfect Cirlce&quot; sound, yet it has still progressed from &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;. The album is very emotional and atmospheric. Some songs have the heavy hard rock sound, such as &quot;Pet&quot;, and others are soft, such as &quot;Gravity&quot;; it is through this range of heaviness and feeling that pulls you further into the differents moods and environment of this album.<br />In addition, the album includes a cool cover of the Failure's &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me.&quot;
B00006LLNU|3.0|The &quot;two Sausages kissing remark is inane&quot;, Mike. Grow out of your 20-year-old, hipper-then-thou smarminess and try to play an instrument for a decade or two then try and get a record produced and distributed for a fan base that does not seek to rule the world with banal quips and Saturday night pedantry.<br />The album is not great. 70s prog rock is musician-music. White Stripes suck. Go back to the tavern for another thought-provoking session of Guiness, mate, and leave the music reviews to people a little less insipid.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I don't get how people can post so many mean reviews about such a fun CD. I got it about two months ago, almost as soon as toxic was out and I still can't get bored of it. Unlike Britney's previous albums, In the Zone does not have any fillers. I love each song on this CD and I do not see why a true music fan  should not like this. If you have never liked Britney's music, you might now because In the Zone is possibly the most different thing from the stuff she had in her teeny bopper days. <br />Yes, some of the lyrics are definately not for under 14 year olds and like someone here said, she isn't a role model for kids but did she ever say she was during realease of her CD? I don't think she has ever mentioned that since the beginning of her career. <BR>In the Zone is a collection of great fun dance pop rnb kinda stuff and I don't see why you shouldn't get it if you like fun pop.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|as I wrote in the title for the review, this is a movie about culture shock. There are two people who find themselves completely lost in a culture they don't understand. This is NOT a movie about stereotypes. It has to do with a natural, yet distorted, view of an unfamiliar reality. ANYONE who has lived abroad knows what I am talking about.<br /><br />Any foreign culture looks odd when you don't speak the language and don't want to be THERE, where ever THERE may be. Japan. Italy. USA. France. Switzerland. Greece. Canada. And so on.<br /><br />I love this movie, needless to say.

055357342X|3.0|This books owes more to TV soaps &amp; dramas like &quot;All My Children&quot; &amp; &quot;Dallas&quot; than it does to written works like Tolkien's &quot;Rings&quot;.<BR> That's not to say it's a &quot;bad&quot; book, far from it.  The story lines are well written and despite the 900 plus pages, it is a very enjoyable fast paced read.  The short chapters focusing on an individual character at a time keep the book flowing and moving forward quickly.  And, like TV soaps, the plotting, scheming and backstabbing (literally in this case) are first rate!  However, if you enjoy reading  books (a trilogy in this case) that come to a conclusion, ending or finale, best look elsewhere.  After 3 books and almost 2500 pages, you would think the &quot;R.R.&quot; could have finished what he started, not.  The book ends with more unanswered questions than answered ones.  Most of the storylines woven throughout the book are left hanging with no closure.  I guess the reader will have to wait for the next installment of the series to find out &quot;who shot J.R.&quot;.  Personally, I am looking forward to the next book; but,  I still can't decide if Martin's choice of the initials &quot;R.R.&quot; is blasphemy.
6304698526|5.0|A movie that was made in 1968, that features:<BR>Color, WideScreen, Surround Sound<br />I enjoyed watching this movie, and happy<BR>to have it part of my dvd collection !!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie was stupid plan and simple. This movie started off slow and ended slower. Its a about a guy who has a small amount of fame from movies in the 60's who goes to Japan to do photo shots about liqure. He meets a woman who is married to a guy who seems loving and faithful, and turns around and cheats on him with a guy who is old and bitter and who is also married. I recommend that you rent or buy a DVD that is better then this. You have been warned, it sucks.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie, and happy<BR>to have it part of my dvd collection !!!
B00018TI5E|5.0|great vocals, great guitars, great songs, great spacey interludes, great lyrics. quirky but solid production, and an overall excellent album flow (so rare)... all of it 100% authentic. to me, that's what completely separates this from any recent RHCP album. where a. keidis sings(for me it's all blah blah blah from the hollywood monkeyboy), j frusciate emotes pure passionate soul.   <BR>i could let this album loop in my car hi-fi for days. it completely satisfies on all levels.
0142004235|5.0|When I first picked up East of Eden, I was not sure that I would enjoy it.  The first 40 or so pages did not hold my attention, but it seems that once I turned to page 41, I was HOOKED and could not put the large novel down until it was done.  <br />The stories of the Hamiltons and Trasks intersect so beautifully and Lee's character is one that I will probably remember forever.  So many of his observations about Americans and California are ones that were true in the 1900s and continue to ring true a century later.  I highlighted many passages in this book as ones that I won't forget and would recommend this book to anyone.
B000002LJW|4.0|I know this isnt Slowhand or From The Cradle but Journeyman is a really good album. None of the songs are really bad so I dont see why anyone could not like it. Journeyman is the best Eric Clapton album of the 1980's. Its not a very forceful album, its more laid back but its still great.<br />The album starts of with one of its best songs 'Pretending' this song sounds like an old blues through back and it has an amzing guitar solo, as always. 'Bad Love' is the biggest hit off the album and the best song on the album too. 'Bad Love' is one of Eric Claptons best songs, once you get past the keyboards. 'Hound Dog' is a great cover, but not one of his better covers. 'No Alibies' is another great song and probly the second best on Journeyman and the solo is just plan amazing! The album ends with 'Before You Accuse Me' and its a cover song and a great way to end the album. 'Before You Accuse Me' is one of the best cover songs Eric Clapton ever recorded.<br />Journeyman may not be as good a From The Cradle and it may not be his most powerful album but this is certainly one of his better albums, this may even be better then slowhand now that I think about it....
B000002LQR|5.0|This is easily the Red Hot Chili Pepper's best album. Every cut featured is awesome. I can't say enough about this album, everything just fits perfectly and Frusciante's guitar playing is excellent, get this CD.
B0000640VO|1.0|This movie should never be watched by anyone. It is just that bad. This movie is to a straight man as a high pitched shrill siren is to an eardrum.<br />Unless sending it to a mortal enemy, don't. Just don't. Buying this only encourages people who make crap like this.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|Matches include:<BR>Cena v Big Show. Passable however the 2 FUs were impressive and the crowd way hot for Cena. Great rap at the beginning of the match to get the crowd to jump start.<br />RVD and Booker v Dudleys v Jindrak and Cade v La Resistance. Terrible match and should have not been on the card. RVD and Booker look put together, Dudleys are stale as hell while the two other are not over in the slightest.<br />Jericho v Christian. A decent match with a shocking ending!. Trish as a heel will be interesting. This feus will contiue after Mania and will transform Jericho as a super-over face again.<br />Cruserweight Open, If given over 15 mins. would have been awesome considering the talent involved, they did the best they could in the limited time. Funny moment, Ultimo Dragon slipping in his entrance.<br />Rock and Foley v Evolution. Decent match, great exchanges between Rock and Flair. Rock is simply the most charismatic man in the histiry of wrestling and show why in the match. Flair can still go on occasion, and this was one of the occasion.<br />Goldberg v Lesnar. Dissapointing match, wrestlers did not care about the match and man the New York crowd let them know about it. However the negative crowd reactions made the match amusing. Good Bye Brock and Goldberg, judging by the reactions, wrestling fans won`t miss you!. These two ego maniacs legitimately passionate wrestlers like Benoit and Guerrero who appreciate being able to perform.<br />Torrie and Sable v Stacy and Jackie, terrible match, should only be featured assegemnt on the pre-show. Wrestling show should have wrestling matches, how do you think Lance Storm and Matt Hardy felt seeing this match. The two easily one of the most gifter wrestlers on the Rw brand and can`t find a space on the card.<br />Guerrero v Angle, technically good match. Mixed reaction for Angle made more entertaining. Two of the best technical wrestlers in the world will produce a great match, no doubt. Innovative ending to the match made it more special.<br />Victoria v Molly, only the ending is mildly ending. A nothing match.<br />Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty v APA v Bashams v WGTT, one excellent tag team + two god awful teams = disaster!. WGTT deserve better then this.<br />Undertaker v Kane, all the hype for the Undertaker to return in his old clothes with a hat. Extremely dissapointed with his return, not been Paul Bearer could make it entertaining. I was expecting the old outfit not the same outfit + a hat and overcoat. Once the bell rang, showed everyone why he should retire immediately.<br />Triple H v Michaels v Benoit, a phenomenal match, awesome crowd reaction for Benoit, one of the greatest Wrestlemania matches of all time. Triple H was looking leaner and therefore was in better cardiovascular condition in the match. All three put there heart and soul in the match and will be remembered as a Wrestlemania moment in years to come.<br />Overall: The matches expected to rock did and the matches expected to suck did too. However, the matches that did rule makes up for the matches that did suck. Crowd reaction in MSG was  dissapointing apart from the negative reaction for the Brock-Goldberg match and postive reaction for Triple Threat Match. Still a great Wrestlemania because of Jericho/Christian, Rock-Foley/Evolution, Guerrero/Angle, Triple H/HBK/Benoit and the disqust of the crowd for the Goldberg/Brock match.
0060922583|1.0|I normally have quite an open mind. But this book is a great example of concepts that give New Age a bad name.<br />This book is at the top of the crackpot list with Immanual Velikovsky's &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot;.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is THE best film EVER! I walked out of the ciemia and was like \\"woah!\\". Did I just watch that?  Was I really there? The CG effects were perfect. They were real enough to believe but still had that \\"fantasy\\" look. eg. pink clouds. <BR>When I found out that Rachel Hurd-Wood (Who plays Wendy) had never done acting before. I said \\"yeh whatever!\\" She obvisously has a natural talent for acting.<BR>Jeremy Sumptor even tnhough he was 14 during filming, he had this cheeky \\"impish\\" smile and personallity which I think was pefect for the roll of Peter Pan.<BR>Jason Issacs. What can I say he was born to be bad. And he was born for the part of Captain Hook (and Mr Darling)indefinatley.<BR>In coinclusion,I just want to say that while this movie may not be for everyone, Im sure YOU could connect to the storeyline in some way. :)
B0000E2FLC|5.0|The word going around on the AC/DC forum at Elektra when this first hit the market was that some of the tracks on this DVD had been over dubbed. Meaning that its not the original sound found on the VHS version! And no one knows why as of yet? But that dosent stop this show from beeing worth buying, only the hardcore AC/DC fan will notcie a few slight changes! Its nothing to worry about, the sound is absolutly fantastic!<br />AC/DC's greatest show is now on DVD. Which is great because I, like many others had the shoddy VHS version that Angus's guitar was not hearable, so I never even knew what the original solos sounded like, the only thing i could tell a diffrence on was TNT it seemed to have been more the &quot;oi oi oi&quot; of the LIVE SE albums chant on TNT ...but again, its nothing to worry about!<br />The extras are a few alternate camera angles! but there a bonus feature, there not one of those ones where you can press your remotes &quot;camera angle&quot; feature, there seprate all together! Theres not one for every song, or is there any two angles for the same song! Most of them are Angus and Brian, one or two for Cliff and Malcolm, and i'm not even sure if Chris Slade got one or not? There is a short Audio Commentry with Angus and Malcolm and they give you some info about some intresting things! And there is a discography of pretty much all the world released AC/DC albums, with Angus and Malcolm putting some Audio Commentry over the top of them if youd like some info about those albums!!!!<br />apart from the new dubbing. This DVD isgreat, and will be the video to make all you non AC/DC fans eyes pop open and hear a sound unlike no other! and the enormous crowd headbanging along to the worlds greatest Rock N Roll band thats sure to make you see this band in a whole new light if you know nothing of the worlds most electrifieing band. This DVD is no disapoinment, and features more footage then released on the VHS! for egsample, the VHS did not come with &quot;High Voltage&quot; and tho its seen as to why it was cut because of some malfunctions with Angus's guitar, its there now for you to enjoy!<br />- this reveiw was done again by me because the damn thing wont save my edit i made to my previous review when i didnt own this DVD yet!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I am still figuring out what the heck the cowboy is doing in this movie among other things.  And I think you've hit it on the head.  I guess you can't take this movie too seriously, and you can't drive yourself nuts trying to figure it all out.  It's a film noir with lots of style and yes, I agree with less substance.  I think Naomi Watts and Luara Harring (if I am not mistaken, she was a Miss America/Universe in her early twenties) did an excellent job portraying their respective characters.  It also helped that they are both very pretty because the camera is right on their faces a lot.  It was pretty brave of them to show off a lot without showing any skitishness or hesitation, that's why a fellow reviewer went as far as describing their sex scenes as one of the sexiest.  Most of the scenes were explicit to the point that you can actually tell, that these girls are all naturelle.  However I think this is just a sidebar and a distraction from one's task as a viewer, which is trying to make sense of it all and David Lynch's talent is making you care and keeping you facinated.  I like this movie a lot because it keeps you entertained and begs you to watch it several more times to make you really understand the premise.<br />The DVD itself gets ZERO STARS.  It has no extras, it doesn't allow you to skip, it has no scene index.  It would have been nice if Mr. Lynch spend a few minutes and perhaps shed some light on his thinking and methods in making the film.  This is my only complaint about this DVD!
B00018D44U|2.0|She doesn't have a great voice, the songs are boring and the lyrics very  poor. I can't understand Norah's success. I bought the CD because the duet with Dolly Parton, the only acceptable track...just because Dolly'sa voice is still amazing. Is not jazz, is not pop, is not country, is not Good.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|surely dont listen to the retard who gave it 1 star i wount say his name ,but i think u know what his name is, DONT TREAT LEGENDS LIKE THAT YOU A!....and that is how you will feel by listening to this album CRAZY, FUN AND WILD!! good for a party actually very good for a party..i REALLY recommend this album(just so you know they are in the top ten Best albums of all time, which they are in number 8 in rolling stone magazine)SO PICK IT UP!!
B0000W3YIS|3.0|When i first bought this album i had a quick listen and didnt find the tracks capured me as instantly or as much as those on her previous albums,however the more i listen to it the more they seem to be growing on me.The songs on this album are definately not as instantly likable and the vocals are a lot weaker than those on her albums prior to this one but they are definately less cheesy(whether thats a good or a bad thing i dont know?),have more of a grown up feel and are moving with the times.I have really got to like this album particularly the track 'Me against the music' but its not good enough for me to put away my old britney albums i am still guilty of dancing around my bed room to 'Baby one more time','Stronger','Over protected' and the like.<BR>I have to buy all her albums as i do a Britney tribute on stage and have to learn all the songs but must admit i would have bought it anyway as im a Britney fan and suggest if you are a Britney fan you buy it too as its nice to listen to and you have to be a loyal fan dont you?<BR>Please visit my website at [...] and give me some support too.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil really does it for me. It really hits the spot. I like that it's a double disc set with lots of good extras too. Affleck is different than I was used to seeing. He's vulnerable, but a fighter. He's a complex guy, but not too hard to relate too and that's interesting from a super guy. Jen Garner is beautiful as always and there are groovy villians. I really enjoyed the baddies here more than any villians since Nicholson's Joker. It's a great pairing of two different types of evil putting together the insane and wild Bullseye and the imposing yet cool Kingpin. I loved a ton of stuff in this movie. The old lady on the plane cracked me up and Ben's dental scene...!! The subway part knocked my socks off and the lead up to the rooftop meeting of Bullseye, Elektra, and Daredevil was tense and exciting. I could go on and on! I'm not sure what the people that hated this wanted, but this hits the spot when I've got a jones for an action movie.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I don't think this is good in any way.  I want less Limp Biz in my life.
B00006L6YH|1.0|If you're a major Diana Krall fan, like I am, don't waste your money on this commercial sellout. Bland orchestral arrangements, zombie-like singing on many of the tracks - this is muzak. A couple of the songs have some personality - it's like Diana suddenly woke up for a few minutes. Not worth the price of admission.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Here's a tip for all you 5-star ballot stuffers like Yoshi Gaiden:  If you are going to engage in ballot stuffing, then it might be a good idea to change your name and location on each vote.  Oh, and maybe wait more than a second or two after your first vote before you submit the next one.  Yeesh...<br />Anyway, this movie stunk, even for something that was supposed to be a quirky, subtle, slow character study, in the indie-film vein.  Forget trying to pick up on the &quot;subtleties&quot; of it, because there are none worth picking up on.  It's just a whole lot of mostly nothing.  Good for insomniacs, though.
B00018D44U|5.0|Chanteuse is a term that may be tempting to use for Ms. Norah Jones. But 'a woman who is a concert or nightclub singer' does terrible injustice to what she really is. She is a unique talent with an out-of-this-world voice and style of singing that is hard to put a genre-label. In Feels like Home, she proves this sentiment even further than what her first album suggested. Her voice and breathy singing style has matured and the selection of songs, both covers and originals have gotten better.<br />This album has a more breezier feel to it and at the same time keeping the strengths of her hugely successful first album. It has more variety but manages to keep the art tasteful and timeless. Growth is exhibited in her mature lyrics added to the timeless Duke Elligton masterpiece and spine-tingling execution of the song. A brave effort indeed and she has the goods to back it up.<br />On the whole, an excellent second effort and in many ways a better album showing incremental growth. I  recommend this album <BR>and give it the highest rating.
B000001ELR|5.0|There is not a filler on here!!! and it is one of the best quality KISS albums I have ever listened to!!! The Highlights are: Creatures of the Night, Saint and Sinner, I Love it Loud, I Still Love You, and War Machine witch are all great strait ahead rock songs!!! Every track on here is a classic in my opinion!! I recomened KISS, Hotter than Hell, Dressed to Kill, Alive!, Destroyer, Rock and roll over, Love Gun, Alive II, Double Platinum, Dynasty, Creatures of the night, and Revenge if you are looking for great KISS albums!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|To &quot;A music fan from somerville, MA United States&quot;, just to make the obviouos explicit, Norah is not everyone's cup of tea. So let us set that aside. May be you are at a point in life, you are looking for more upbeat sound. But regarding the hype you mention, the facts are that there is 'no hype'. People talk about Norah mainly because her CD sold 18 million copies worldwide without much hype. The talk of 'no hype' creats its own hype and that is probably what you were hearing.<br />Anyway, just to relate the story of someone who is touched by her music everytime I listen to her, there is something in her voice, her way of singing, the breathy technique, whatever... that gets directly into your system without you really processing it in any rational way. That is why it is hard to describe 'Why' her music is so captivating. Don't know why :-). Yes, there is talent, musical schooling etc. but then thousands of others have that. That is what great art is. If it is easily explainable rationally, then it becomes too scientific and less as an art form.<br />I sort of smile at myself when lots of critics try to rationalize her music, put her in genre pigeonholes, compare her with other great female singers. Individually that all makes sense but what is inexplicable is the real effect of her music is lot more than the sum of those individual parts.<br />The common reaction millions of people have when they hear her for the first time is 'Who is that? What kind of music is that?&quot;<br />That shows there is a magical and unique quality to her.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|If I wanted to hear a squealing, howling b!tch I'd skin a poodle!
B0000009SI|5.0|Well this is without a doubt one of FZ's greatest studio accomplishments . The album really has no low points or filler songs (I could have done without all the percussion and insanity of \\"St. Alfonso's Pancake Breakfast\\" and \\"Father Oblivion\\" ...but thats just me) . Aside from that you get number of songs featuring Frank doing the virtuoso AND satire thing ,and of course the amazing instrumental title track (listen for former Cream bassist Jack Bruce playing the buzzing and distorted bass line) . <br />Now lyrics wise the first half of Apostrophe is about a eskimo named Nanook. Which yes does make this somewhat of a concept al bum ( Frank's answer to the \\"rock opera\\" ?). My advice here is keep yourself from looking at the \\"meaning of this \\" or the \\"deeper message\\". Too many people ruin Zappa's music when they do this, just sit back have a laugh, and enjoy.<br />If you dont own any Zappa or if you know someone who is curious about Zappas music then this is a good place to start . Because if you dont like this album or get bored with it then you're just never gonna like FZ. Not to mention that there is something to like on here, fan or not.
B00000AFWW|5.0|This, Hole's third CD, has more emphasis on accessible, pop music songs than does their second CD, previous to this one,Live Through This. Instead of the screaming grunge of Live Through This, most of the songs on this CD although they display lyrics as complex as ever are musically a world away from the band's prior work. All but a few of the songs on this CD I like and since these and all the rest of the songs are good it is hard to choose my favorite. My favorite song though would probably be ''Boys on the radio'' this loud and noisy but melodic song of melancholy ambiguity could be about any number of things, which is certainly the hallmark of any good song. Another favorite song of mine is the quiet gentle ''Dying'' with the hypnotic whisper of Courtney Love at the begining of the track ''I've had it all forever, I've had enough''. The title song  ''Celebrity Skin'' about fading ''somewhere in Hollywood'' has powerful lyrics that stay with you and catchy music. Another song I like is the more grunge ''Playing your song'' about naive appreciation after the fact ''You trusted everything-they sold you out''. ''Northern Star'' is a bleak powerful song which is generally interpreted to refer at least a little to Kurt Cobain. The complex ornate ''Petals'' and the lovely very grunge, ''Use once and destroy'' are both standout songs. If you like this kind of music, this is a CD that you can listen to again and again and still find new meaning in.
B00005JMEW|4.0|At first i didn't like how the movie sounded until i actually watched it. It was cool, And WAY BLOODY. A female assasin almost killed by her \\"So called friends\\". Who now wants revenge. She wants to \\"Kill bill\\".I really like the anime parts(The Japanese cartoons in the movie). Those were one of the best anime drawings i've seen. The music sometimes is a little classical, and strange at times (Like the asian band singing oo woot woot oot!) If you like the songs i highly suggest you getting the sound track also.But the ending kindof just cut off, Well thats because theres gonna be more Kill bill volumes. The movie is pretty long, more than 2 hours. <BR>If you like action, horror, Lots of blood, A girl dressed as a nurse(Which some of you may like) and Anime. This movie is good for you. But don't let kids see it. Unless there mature enough.<BR>Oh and if you like lucy liu, she's in it!
B000002LPD|5.0|Many did not like Van Hagar because of the fact that things slowed down and love songs were brought in.  But on this album, Van Halen Mark II were one cohiesive unit.  No Love Songs here.  The only real ballad on here was &quot;Right Now&quot;, which along with &quot;Dreams&quot; is one of their best ballads.  The rest of the album is pretty hard rocking, except for 316, a slow instrumental dedicated to Eddie's son, Wolfgang, born March 16.<br />My Rundown:<br />Poundcake-One of the hardest rocking openers.  It makes me want to get up and jump and bang my head.<br />Judgment Day-The bottom heavy sound comes through on this track.  A song telling people to leave each other alone, it is a mantra for me.<br />Spanked-The sleazy midnight feel.  It has a great groove and continues the bottom heavy sound.<br />Runaround-Another song like Poundcake.  It rocks hard as it deals with the woes of dealing with women.<br />Pleasure Dome-This was the most progressive song VH ever did.  It was pretty cool, the way it just continued to build from beginning to end.<br />In 'N Out-Another great track that talks about money and the effect on peoples' lives.<br />Man on A Mission-This was a really fun track.  Deals once again with lust and has a good groove.<br />The Dream is Over-This track encompasses my mood when I am down.  I enjoy it a lot because I went through a situation which I felt the same way as this song conveys.<br />Right Now-One of VH's best ballads. It talks about taking the initiative.  It also has some great guitar and keyboard work courtesy of Eddie.<br />316-Great instrumental<br />Top of the World-Great closer to a great album.  <br />In short, if you are a classic VH fan, but are not sure about Van Hagar because it does not rock as hard, and has too many love songs, give this album a second look, seriously.  This is an album that even people who dislike Van Hagar should own.
0679879269|5.0|Similar to books such as Harry Potter, Phillip Pullman has pulled another extraordinary book. With adventures of Lyra and Will through the worlds and expditing issues we have in this world, I highly recommend you to read this book. =].
B00005QZWI|5.0|Wow. This is good, this is very good. I've never heard a score so intense or so wide ranging. There is so much to love on this cd that 17 bucks seems way too low, but I'll take it. Shore has managed to take dissonance and dischord and turn it into powerful, groundbreaking music. The opening track really set the stage with some intriguing, dark and intense themes pounded out by the London Philharmonic (Not the the New Zealand Shymphony Orchestra as amazon says). The second track is a folk tune piece for the Shire featuring a solo fiddle and solo pan flute over strings and hammer dulcimer. This theme shows the beauty of the hobbits' home and the simple and comfortable life they lead. The music then moves on to darker matters, as we are introduced to the intense theme of the black riders and of Mordor. These themes feature pounding percussion, screaming brass and chorus. Int he fourth track we are first treated to the fellowship theme as Sam Frodo and Gandalf have already formed a fellowship. In track nine, many meetings where everyone meets up at Rivendell, we hear a fully developed hobbit theme with a countermelody below it, which is incredibly beautiful. While I'm not a fan of Enya, her contributions to the score are admirable and she does a fine job with the love songs for Aragorn and Arwen. It is in track 11, the Rings Goes South, that we first hear the fellowship theme in it's full glory, it is heard at the end of track 10 as well, but only for a short time. The Bridge of Khazad-Dum is pure action and features a Maori choir chanting out heavy lines as the Balrog closes in on them, near the end we hear a mourning for Gandalf. The score's most interesting track is featured next, Lothlorien, as there are several unique instruments used that lend a very eastern quality to the piece. Over this, Elizabeth Fraser sings in very ethereal voice, the main theme for Lothlorien, which we will hear in march form in the two towers battle. The most beatiful writing I've ever heard for a motion picture comes in track 17, the breaking of the fellowship which is beyond description, the same theme is used in the end of the two towers as well as all the forces of evil are beaten back. The score then ends with some beautiful music and some good singing by Enya in &quot;May it Be.&quot; This score will definitely go down in the history books, there are very few scores by anyone that can even come close, Harry Potter and Jurassic Park are the only ones that come to mind. The work by Shore and Peter Jackson has been so incredible and so passionate you can definitely appreciate it beyond any other in film history. Middle Earth came alive in me again after hearing this soundtrack, even before I saw the film. Highest Recommendation.
0385504209|1.0|I READ THIS BOOK SIMPLY BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT. AS A FEMALE, I ALMOST BECAME INTRIGUED WITH DAN BROWN'S THEME REGARDING THE RELIGIOUS, HISTORICAL TREATMENT OF WOMEN.HOWEVER, SOMETHING RAISED THE RED FLAGS IN MY MIND. THE ONLY THING I CAN REALLY POINT AT IS MR. BROWN'S TERRIBLE WRITING STYLE. IT IS SO ANNOYINGLY POOR, I DEFINITELY WILL NOT READ MORE OF HIS WORK. AND, I BELIEVE IF A AUTHOR CANNOT REASONABLY WRITE WELL, IT FOLLOWS THAT HIS INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY INTERPRET HISTORY. I KNOW MR. BROWN IS MAKING MERRY TRIPS TO THE BANK AND HIS LAUGHTER IS OK WITH ME. I HAVE LAUGHINGLY ENJOYED READING ALL THE REVIEWS ON THIS INSIGNIFICENT BOOK. THESE DAYS I APPRECIATE HUMOR WHERE EVER I CAN FIND IT. READ THIS BOOK IF YOU MUST AND WANT TO BE FULLY ENGAGED IN CONTEMPORARY LIFE ALA ALL THE OTHER POPULAR FANTASIES OUT THERE.<br />PS: MINERVA, I AM ON YOUR SIDE BUT GIRL, YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SPELL SO PEOPLE WILL RESPECT YOUR OPINION. PEACE.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Every once in a while there is a soundtrack that has nothing but great inspired music in every track. This is one of those scores. Howard Shore has managed to take his incredible Fellowship soundtrack and build upon it to make this wonderful score. Several of the first film's themes re-appear along side some moving new themes. Also in this score, we see Shore experiment with some interesting instrumentations, with great success. In the treebeard track we hear some large wooden percussion and slow, lumbering beats which will re-create the first time you saw Treebeard. You hear the age, the wisdom, and the anger that is part of the Ents. The Rohan theme works even better. For the main theme, which is presented in the third and sixth tracks, Shore chose a Norwegian fiddle, called a Hardinger. The music for Rohan is very heroic especially in the third track where it shows how much of a nation Rohan once was, but is no longer. But at the same time, it seems to have some despair to it as the fiddle starts to be weaker and less powerful in the sixth track. The hobbit theme is used many times throughout the score, most notably in the beginning as the film opens up on Frodo and Sam venturing through the rocky pass. The fellowship theme is presented very powerfully in the fifth track where the chase for the orcs is on. However, the most powerful moment in the film comes in the end of the battle of Helm's Deep where Gandalf arrives and the orcs are chased out. The theme used here which is a modification of the Rohan theme, is one of pure power and emotional release. The music for the end of the Ents' battle and the release of Frodo and Sam is the same as it was at the end of the first film, but it was too good not to put in both. The final song is the only track that I have a problem with. Don't get me wrong, the music is wonderful and the orchestrations are great, but Torrini's voice just doesn't do it for me. This track, known as Gollum's song would've been great with anybody else's voice, except her's. I can see why they used her, in a sense, because she has a very childish and innocent voice, showing how Gollum is actually very childish in thought and action, corrupted, but childish. But her voice is hard to listen to after hearing the rest of the score. However, you may like it, I don't know, what I DO know is that you will absolutely adore the rest of the score and will have a hard time putting it away. The music for the Lord of the Rings is absolutlely incredible and should not be missed by any fan of any type of music. Highest Recommendation.
0783230702|5.0|When approaching a subject such as time travel one has to decide which school of thought they attend. First School; Time is linear and will be altered by any outside interference. Easy way to think of it, Time is a single string, if you jump from the end of the string to the middle time in a way reorders itself and all reprecussions of your actions (from the middle of the string) play through the string to alter the end of the string. Or Time is non linear and/or branching: basically all choices you can make are played out through multiple strings of reality becoming a criss crossed spider web. This movie takes the first opinion and hints at the idea that time abhors being altered and will \\"right\\" itself any way it can. Theory: Hitler dies at birth, but is replaced by time with a new personality with the same agenda. Meaning Time has to be hammered/altered repeatedly like a piece of hot steel to force it to hold the shape you wish of it. That being said i will only say i thought the movie was a truly well thought out and intelligent take on time theory far better than most. 1 Note to those who review: dont pan something simply because you dont bother to take all possiblities into account. 2 If you have to watch a movie 2 to 3 times to understand the concept of the story or the twist ending, dont bother buying this without renting it first. Just go rent Navy Seals and drool to your hearts content. OoOOoOO Navy Seals!
0385504209|1.0|As a matter of fact I was attempted to the book because of the press hurray, and, actually thrilling at the beginning the book ends much lame. Maybe the author should have read something more profoundly than the usual popular bogus. Especially the claims about Leonardo are twisted and they are also misleading the general reader, as a matter of fact, unfortunately we have a lot of self-proclaimed Da Vinci experts here in Turkey right now because of it. About the religious claims: In a society where the Christian faith and practice is not well known, this book made some interesting effect and now everyone awaits the much hyped Gibson's movie. What a coincidence :-) I'll have to read Eco again; as a &quot;real scholar&quot; he writes better &quot;fiction&quot; than this.
B00009TB5G|5.0|although, in my opinion, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is my third favourite in the triology, do not assume that it means is bad. far beyond the truth! indeed, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is the essential &quot;Middle Film&quot; as they call it, literally the following scene from the end of the &quot;Fellowship&quot;, and is a perfect way to get you trully urging for the &quot;Return&quot;. In saying that I must warn anyone now: DO NOT SEE THIS WITHOUT HAVING SEEN THE FIRST and ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SEE THE THIRD WITHOUT SEEING THIS or i promise you, you will be totally, utterly confused. HEHE!<br />The fellowship is broken. now the story breaks again into three superbly moulded adventures, Merry and Pippin's entrapment in fangorn forest, aragorn and co prepare for the battle of helm's deep with repaired kingdom rohan, and of course, our dear frodo and sam continue their quest towards the never-sleeping mordor, accompanied by their guide Gollum to destroy the One Ring, which of course is tragically beginning to take power over frodo.<br />the battle of helm's deep is an absolutley wonderful scene. epic battles and superb stunts really give it a finishing kick. They really are fantastic! And the ancient Ent, Treebeard who befriends Merry and Pippin is a startling special effect. Of course the most impressive addition in this movie is the creature Gollum, totally moulded from a human actor (Andy Serkis) into a revolutionary computer animated delight!<br />This film probably was my thrid favourite, because there is alot of the story focussing on the men, which of course is perfectly fine as that is how it is like in the book. my favourite character is frodo, and i would have loved to see him included a bit more in the epic. But not to worry - because the closing scenes are magnificent and emotional (a snippet to whats in store for the third!) when frodo and sam, who have had their friendship tested on their journey, trully strengthen their bond. It's extremely moving!<br />This film is amazing! It's a perfect &quot;Middle Film&quot; for what has become the greatest triology ever brought to the big screen. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is an honest adaption of Tolkein's masterpiece, mixed with beautiful cinematography, inspiring music, extraordinary special effects, epic battle scenes and amazing acting by elijah wood (frodo) and sean astin (sam) in particular!<br />Following on from the magic of the &quot;Fellowship&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; locks you in for the most astonishing finale you could ever imagine! beautiful beyond words

0385504209|4.0|I liked this book.  It was interesting, fast-paced, and fun.  On the downside, the book attempts to &quot;teach&quot; you the entire time, which gets a little patronizing and annoying towards the end.  Still, the information provided is interesting.
B000089RVX|5.0|One of a few albums where I liked all the songs in it. Amy Lee's voice clearly stands out in all the songs. If you like alternative rock, this is the cd you want to have in your collection.
B00005AQGH|5.0|This last album by Tupac represents all the anger and hatred exhibited by Tupac in his final years with us. If you're looking for an album that packs a punch, look no further: this is Tupac's most aggresive work, targeted directly at exhibiting his hatred for more commercial rappers, we all know who, but also intended to show the limits of his tolerance. Many excellent tracks, most notably &quot;Hail Mary&quot; and &quot;Hold ya head&quot; are a testament to Tupac's lyrical genius. When you listen to this album, you dont necessarily remember the beats such as in Dr. Dre's albums or even in previous Pac records such as in All Eyez on Me, but the fire behind his message. This album, more than any other rapper's until this point, displays both the anger towards his ennemies, some of which he suspected were responsible for the attempted murder in New York, as well as the turn of a man no longer using his gift for financial rewards but rather to send a warning. Unfortunately, Tupac never lived long enough to see the effects of this powerful work.
B000069HZP|1.0|Put your imagination on hold, place your intellect on the shelf, and maybe, just maybe, you might enjoy this movie. lt is perhaps the most contrived shlock film with the most ludicrous plot and the most impossible events and occurrences of any film l've ever seen in the past 60 years. lf you don't shake your head in despair by the middle of this muddle, you are probably not a film buff. And if you don't burst out laughing at the incredulous conclusion, you qualify for the &quot;Edd Wood Award For Puerility&quot;. Shame on the writer, producer, director &amp; studio!
0385504209|5.0|I'm in the process of reading this book (at page 300 now). It is a breathtaking BOOK. I am writing BOOK in capitals, because that is what it is...<br />It is funny to see how a book like this triggers as much reactions as it does. Did you notice the 5 stars and 1 stars? There is no in between...<br />It IS a book that is breathtaking, full of speed, and - if you are really UNBIASED with respect to christianic faith (I am atheist...) opens up NEW perspectives.<br />Quite possibly, we will never find out the truth of the historicy Jesus Christ. But, as is rightfully stated in this book: the bible itself was written by men...<br />So...any story could be the truth...<br />Have you ever noticed that any arguments that reason against religious reasoning refer to the holy books of the religion itself?<br />That is in contrast to the famous Goedel paradigm: no truth can ever be established from within (this is a free form expression...).<br />Oh, just read the book as it is: a thrilling experience...

The Clash are a life-changing kind of band.<br /> Highlights include: White Riot, Complete Control, Clash City Rockers, White Man in Hammersmith Palais, Bankrobber, The Call Up, and Rock the Casbah.
630196697X|5.0|The camera angles, the emotion, the violent outbursts of its characters and the suspense can be sensed in every frame of this film. Sam Fuller did create a masterpiece and it won him the Best Film Award at the Venice Film Festival in 1954 - deservedly!<br />The acting: Widmark is at his best. His Skip is a bomb threatening to explode any time. This is probably Jean Peters's best acting job in a movie. This actress has a lot of fire in her that she seems to keep under control, but - like Widmark - you can sense it can explode any time. Thelma Ritter (who was nominated for an Oscar for her performance) is tops as well and so is Richard Killey. These four actors in fact should have all been nominated for awards and certainly the film should have been - but that was Hollydwood in the 50's - the film was controversial, a film noir at that and Cinemascope and spectacles had entered the picture and sweeping all the awards then selected by fools enchanted with special effects, color and big screens. <BR>This film is a jewel and it should be given more attention, more credit, and you should see it!!!
0140277447|1.0|A reader from CA, USA may not know the American history textbook on WW2 is different from the rest of the world. Also this person may not know every nation's history textbook is different from the rest of the world and Japanese history textbook on WW2 is very similar to American's because America had overwritten Japanese history and censored every media. Even private letters had been censored.<br />How can we know what we believe is the truth is really truth? Freedom of speech requires skepticism and criticism for keeping ourselves from being deceived.

B00001OH7T|1.0|It's ironic that David Bowie refers to this album as his version of American soul.  Like most of David Bowie's &quot;innovations&quot;, this work is based upon the previous works of other artists.  In this case, David derived his inspiration from the great British soul band, Hot Chocolate.<br />Bowie emulates Errol Brown on all of the successful tracks.  The fact that Brown was later accused of being influenced by David Bowie's vocal style - is nearly as ridiculous as Bowie frequently being credited for influencing rock innovator, Alice Cooper.  Even Bowie's Spider band members admit that Alice Cooper was the prime influence on their music / presentation.<br />With the possible exception(s) of Sting and Madonna, David Bowie is the most highly overrated performer of the past 40 years.  To paraphrase Mark Twain, his works are both good and original; but the original parts aren't good - and the good parts aren't original.
B000050XEI|4.0|Although I don't actually own this album, I have listened to it in it's entirety before. I own Enya's 'Only Time' box set and most of my favorite songs from that are on this album. <br />Enya's soothing voice and the music that backs her fit perfectly, like two puzzle pieces. I think it is an amazing feat that she writes all the music, plays all the synths, and dubs all the voices herself. That is probably why her CD releases are so few and far between. <br />There are so many good songs on here, like 'Only Time', which was used for the September 11 coverage. It's beauty and simplicity soothed a wounded nation after that tragic day. I also love 'Wild Child'. The song reminds us to stop and take time to enjoy our surroundings, to stop and smell the roses. 'Tempus Vernom' is quite different from the rest of the album, and works wonderfully here to give some more upbeatness to the album.<br />The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, which it most definitely deserves, is because of the short length. It seemed to me that as soon as the album started, it was over. <br />All Enya fans need this album, in my humble opinion, her best yet.
B00005ASGG|5.0|&quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; is for my money the most profound and deeply felt work of art in John Ford's filmography. Lacking the scenic values of &quot;The Searchers&quot; or even &quot;Stagecoach,&quot; the movie zeroes in on what may be the most complex and fascinating group of characters in any Western. James Stewart plays Ransom Stoddard, newly credentialed lawyer and greenhorn in the rough frontier town of Shinbone; John Wayne is Tom Doniphon, longtime town resident famous for settling disputes with his fists and his six-gun. Their differing ways of dealing with Liberty Valance, one of the lowest, meanest, most sadistic outlaws in Western movie history (played by Lee Marvin in perhaps the best bad-guy turn of his career) sets up the central conflict from which emanate all the themes of this uncommonly rich, satisfying film. Here in one two-hour film is the entire story of how the Western frontier gave way to civilization, and what precisely was gained and lost in the taming of the West. There are scenes of palm-sweating suspense here--particularly the central showdown with Valance--as well as performances as brilliant as Ford ever coaxed from an ensemble cast. Stewart, Wayne and Marvin at least equal their career bests here, as do such estimable veterans as Edmond O'Brien, Vera Miles, Woody Strode, Andy Devine, John Qualen, Jeanette Nolan and John Carradine. The final, breathtakingly ironic line of dialogue will stay with you for a long, long time.
0380807343|5.0|Gaiman does it again, reaching now for a different and seemingly lost genre, the dark fairy tale.  This book is certainly the most chilling children's book I have ever read.  I shivered as Coraline turned each dark corner to uncover another unfortunate misadventure.<br />Gaiman's love for dark fairy tales that he was told as a child bleeds through in this story.  Coraline is a modern day Alice, unlocking a forbidden door rather than falling down a rabbit hole.  And her white rabbit is simply her own childish curiosity.  The book is also typical horror as Coraline constantly ignores the plea, \\"Don't go in there.\\"<br />The defining moment in the book is when Coraline is talking with a black cat, reflecting on an incident in which her and her father stumbled on a swarm of wasps and her father protected her, taking 39 stings of his own, Coraline only suffering one.  In the commotion, her father had dropped his glasses.  He decided later to return for them.  \\"He said he wasn't scared when he was standing there and there were wasps stinging him and hurting him... Because he knew he had to give me enough time to run.  And he said that wasn't brave of him...  It wasn't brave because he wasn't scared:  it was the only thing he could do.  But going back again to get his glasses, when he knew the wasps were there, when he was really scared.  That was brave.\\" (58-59)<br />This memory parallels Coraline's decision to rescue her parents from the terrible \\"other mother\\" (whose frightening disposition and macabre intentions send chills up even this adult reader's spine), regardless of her own knowledge of how dangerous a quest it would be.<br />Though I would not read this book to my 3 year old, it is super scary storytelling for young adults and a dark fantasy to be enjoyed by adults, as well.  Gaiman is great!
B000002UA5|4.0|This was one of the most difficult Pink Floyd albums to assign a rating to, because in spite of its several difficulties, I can't help but love it.  The studio disk, an experiment in which each band member did his own composition without any help from the others (including lyrics and playing of *all* instruments) somehow manages to prove at the same time just how much each member, even in early days, was capable of on his own and just how much they needed each other in order to create that distinctive Pink Floyd sound.  The live disk, on the other hand, is for the most part positively stunning in terms of *performance* quality--except the *recording* quality leaves much to be desired.<br />Here is what, in my personal opinion, each solo composition reveals.  The album opens with Richard Wright's &quot;Sysyphus&quot;, a very strange exploration including everything from classical piano to complete chaos, and some *very* eerie wordless vocals from Mr. Wright (if you think THAT'S strange, try slowing down the part with all the clanking noises and high-pitched laughter to half-speed to hear what the vocals sounded like in original form!).  While imperfect, &quot;Sysyphus&quot; more than any other piece on Ummagumma has a clearly planned structure from beginning to end; his talent for long compositions clearly had emerged early.  David Gilmour's &quot;The Narrow Way&quot; is also a largely pleasant listen, basically an exploration of various guitar stylings.  It's also Mr. Gilmour's first lyrical outing, and while what I can *hear* sounds decent--his vocals are *woefully* undermixed, and there isn't a lyrics sheet in the liner notes of the CD.  A pity, really.<br />Roger Waters' &quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot; is interesting in a far more simplistic fashion--idyllic lyrics and a meandering acoustic guitar and soft vocals far from the angry shrieking of &quot;In the Flesh&quot; are nice, but it feels rather like a demo.  This song is much better in live versions.  Of course, he doesn't let you get too comfortable; he makes sure to wreck the delicate moment with a rude surprise.  Then comes &quot;Several Species&quot;, the alternately amusing and annoying experiment with tape effects, one of the album's weaker spots.  The weakest spot is Nick Mason's &quot;Grand Vizier's Garden Party&quot;, which although like &quot;Sysyphus&quot; supposedly has a structure, it has none of the flow.  Aside from a nice drum solo at one point, it's too much for me to wade through in the end.  I can't say what he'd do given the chance in 2004, but I can see that in 1969, his talents were less in composing and more in performing.<br />Mixing problems plague the live side as well--I have heard bootlegs from the time period that sound much better in technical terms.  One cannot even distinguish the voices of the band members from each other without serious effort, and the overall sound is severely muddied.  However, that said, if you can hear *through* all that, what lies underneath is an *excellent* performance, with the exception of Mr. Gilmour's vocals on &quot;Celestial Voices&quot;, which are, as usual in live perfomrances, a bit dodgy.  Overall, I feel that Ummagumma is well worth the purchase for its live side, as well as for the insight into the individual Floyd members--but don't be deceived; it's far from perfect.  (P.S.: It doesn't hurt that it's quite well priced for a double-album set.)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had my doubts about the wisdom of blending western (a genre I don't particularly fancy) with sci-fi, but as this show had Joss Whedon (of Toy Story, Angel and Buffy fame) at the helm I had to check it out - and I'm almost sorry I did. You get drawn into this series incredibly fast, it's over far too soon and you're left with an insatiable hunger for more. And not just me - this is one show (the only, I think) my husband and I are equally fascinated by.<br />There are too many aspects I love about this show to list them all, but let me highlight a few:<br />The Setting<BR>Firefly is a small space ship, smuggling and doing odd jobs under the radar of the Alliance, the rulers of this fulture world. That's how the Firefly crew get to meet high and low in the different worlds. But most of the time, the ship is just travelling in the empty space between worlds, just a tiny fleck in the void. This solitude yet beauty of space is conveyed better here than in any other sci-fi series where the usual impression is that you can't turn your ship in a new direction without bumping into other space crafts or inhabited planets. It also puts the focus solidly on the interaction between the characters, which brings me to the next point.<br />The Characterisation<BR>The people aboard Firefly are real people, with their strong and weak points, hopes and fears, world views and difficult decisions. Instead of self-important archetypes in colourful suits trying to save humanity from extinction, you get complex and realistic characters with very present and understandable issues.  The way they're disclosed to the viewer through their reactions to the different worlds Firefly visits, the problems they face and even more to each other is the show's strongest attraction, puntuated by the sparkling dialogue. This is really what makes you weep for Fox's foolish decision to kill this beauty before it was fully matured. I miss the people! <br />The Look<BR>Firefly's world spans from the high tech you expect from a science fiction to the grit you know from a western and both are equally engaging and real to the watcher. The judicious use of handheld camera draws you into the world, but doesn't distract. Colours are used to great effect to signal the different worlds the crew move in - the yellow of the high noon prairie, the blue of high tech facilities and the deep empty blackness of space.<br />Firefly is an awesome show. I can't wait to see the movie, and my dearest hope is that the movie will spawn a series. Firefly is a thoroughly adult show with all the best things from Whedon's other shows - Buffy and Angel: The witty yet poignant dialogue, the way the characters' inner life is brought out in the main plot, the unexpected twists and turns of a great story arc. Get it at your own risk - you'll be sorry when it's over!
B00005JN02|5.0|Just saw the film.  Very, very good portrayal of life in the former DDR.  Visited there in 1976.  Really a very touching story of a young mans love for his dying Mother and the bizarre things he would do to maintain a charade.  Quirky, screwball, black humor.  A must see!!
B000089RVX|5.0|Before I heard Evanescence, i was &quot;Going Under&quot;, but when I saw DAREDEVIL THE MOVIE, i was blown away by the songs that were actually Evanescence.

They are truly amazing, and this Album will blow you away, I garuantee.
B00003CXRP|4.0|It's hard to think of a movie in which the hero ponders a metaphorical crossroads in his life while standing at a literal crossroads. Insipid or inspired? The problem with Robert Zemeckis's visually and viscerally eye-punching Robinson Crusoe ins that you can't say for sure. Could the movie really be as thematically trite as an insprirational office poster? Or is it an admirably stripped- down examination of the ancestral essence of being human?<br />Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) doesn't worry about such big questions. He's airlifted into Moscow and other emerging capital hot-spots when local operations are absolutely, positivly running from that tireless hunter: time. (It's alerrgorical! Get it?) Summoned on Christmas to make an emergency run, Chuck leaves his fiencee Kelly (Helen Hunt) with the promise that he'll return New Year's Eve. Cue from a &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;: Chuck and the FedEx jet crew lose radio contact and crash into the Pacific Ocean in a truly harrowing, you-are-there disaster sequence. This is no film for the squeamish, particularly after Chuck and a few FedEx packages wash up on an unnamed, utterly uninhabited island (Fiji's Monukiri and Mana, actually).<br />Almost everything, from what Chuck's forced to eat to his horror at consequences of a desert-island toothache, is accompanied by all the blood and guts left over from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.<br />Add in Chuck's deteriorating hold on sanity---evinced by the inspired conceit of his relationship with a volleyball on which he has drawn a face---and you have a long middle section of bravura filmaking.<br />But once Chuck get home, the film turns anticlimatic and emotionally nil, and there's a startling lack of chemistry between Hanks and an unimpressive Hunt.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost In Translation is not a typical movie because it is essentially a foreign film driven by characters and not by plot or action.  This of course causes the massive negative reviews by most Americans who only like to see big explosions, fights, and naked women in films.<br />Bill Murray does a wonderful job with his character, almost underplaying it with subtle grace and humour.  The backsetting of Tokyo creates a surreal setting in which the viewer doesn't know what is going on.  The glimpses of a foreign culture with all of its oddities to us helps develop the character's motivations and problems.  Both of the principle performers really portray their characters' flaws which helps the viewer identify with them.  The ending was not quite what was expected, but it seemed very realistic.
0446677450|5.0|It appears as though more than 1/2 dozen five star reviews have been deleted from the Rich Dad Poor Dad thread alone. Then even more on Cash Flow Quadrant, Rich Dad's Guide to Investing as well as other books like The Millionaire Next Door, The Millionaire Mind, The Purpose Driven Life, Wall Street Money Machine, More Wealth Without Risk and 9 Steps to Financial Freedom so far.<br />So what's up with t hat Amazon? Why are certain reviews and reviewers being deleted. Certaintly it can't be a quality issue (just take a look at the one star reviews)<br />It appears to some of us that only a certain self publishing author can get posts on here that stay. And wht's up with blocking helpful or unhelpful votes on certain books. And what's up with why it took so long to get that ridiculous gambling book reliminated as a favorite book along with Rich Dad Poor Dad. I don't know of a single person who ascribes to the concepts and principles that Kiyosaki or his real Rich Dad taught him who believe in gambling. So why did it take so long to remove and how did it get on th ere to  begin with? Does Amazon have any control over their employees who man the controls or is it really that easy to get in and hack into Amazon? So much for encryption! Yeah, I bet I'll leave my credit card or otherf personal information here again.<br />The point is, either Amazon better get it together or Amazon can look forward to continue to lose more and more customers to their rivals.<br />As for Rich Dad Poor Dad and other books by Kiyosaki, I can sum his material up in one word--OUTSTANDING! But only if you are perceptive enough to see it.<br />Some people obviously would rather participate in sending out spam, sell email addresses, gamble, write inferior books via self publishing or whatever.<br />Some of us prefer to do things ethically like Kiyosaki teaches. Which brings me to another point. Look at all of the reviews (1 stars) that have been placed since Friday and usually every weekend. Do youreally think that successful people are posting those reviews? I mean there are exceptions like myself who post in disgust to the crap that takes place here, but on the whole, how many really successful people would camp on this or any website expecially on weekends which is typically the time to refresh yourself, spend time with family, friends, church etc.<br />Amazon, hope you get it together or you will continue to see your stock drop by unhappy shareholders and lose customers by people disgusted witht he actions of some of the people on this board. You may want to start by dropping this review board. It serves no real purpose and I am sure that my review (if posted) will be buried under a melee of senseless 1 star reviews.<br />You guys had a novel idea. What happened???
B00003CXPJ|5.0|how can i even start on one of the funniest movies i have ever seen, I went to go watch this one with a couple of friends when it was released in theaters, and after it was done we were all pretty dissapointed,I wasnt quite sure what to think but i knew that i didnt enjoy what i has just payed for and watched. Then it came out on dvd, and the funny thing was that i would think about some of the things that happened in the film and i would laugh, it was strange because after time it was just funny to me, so i picked up the dvd, 1st i borrowed it and now i own it, I dont know how i didnt like it the 1st time!! this movie is so funny, that i can prob watch it all the time(which i have) and i know baisically every line in the movie, Will Ferrell is amazing as usual,ben stiller and owen wilson are perfect as 2 stupid male models, ALot of classic moments in this film, i would reccomend it to anyone who wants to have a good laugh, PLus the dvd has many cool extras check it out!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|In a time when rap/hip-hop is ruled by music that has no real meaning; Kanye produces an album that not only hits you with beats that make your head sway, but also have meaningful lyrics that hit your soul. <br />I have no problem giving this album 5 stars because it deserves it. I feel that Kanye has put his heart and soul into this album and it shows. I believe that the quote, &quot;This album will become a classic&quot; is no way short of the truth. <br />This album is worth buying. If anyone says it is not, then they do not know music.
B00005JMQ0|5.0|I get a bit of chuckle seeing the way 'Fog of War' gets listed on amazon.com...\\"Starring: Fidel Castro, John F. Kennedy, et al.\\".  Ignore that.  This movie is all about Robert S. McNamara, and - to an even greater extent - the vision of brilliant documentary specialist Errol Morris and his capable crew.<br />To get an appreciation of Morris' skill, I suggest you check out \\"Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary.\\"  Great story, but - for the most part - the impact of it is diluted by a botched production.  In 'Fog,' you get the complete package: a compelling subject (love him or loathe him, McNamara (...) compelling viewing); seamless editing; pitch-perfect historical images to match the stories; Morris' wonderful 'falling domino' imagery; and (especially) Phillip Glass' extraordinary soundtrack.  Morris and his team have thrown the equivalent of a perfect game here.<br />One image that sticks with me (others have noted it here as well): a heavy-lidded JFK is about to give the nation a briefing on the Cuban Missile Crisis.  He stares blankly into the camera.  For a second I thought Morris had frozen the image.  Suddenly, the frozen Kennedy blinks.  Morris stays with the image longer.  Glass' eerie music builds in the background.  Kennedy slowly blinks again.<br />A great cinematic moment by a great filmmaker.  'Fog of War' is filled with moments like these.
B00005MM67|5.0|This movie changed my life (is that a bit over the top?!)!<br />The story is loosely based on the first American ascent of K2. This is the second highest mountain on earth and arguably the most difficult to conquer. It clearly has been one of the most dangerous of all the earth's great peaks. By the end of the last century, fully 13% of all who summitted died during the descent--that's compared to only 3% on Everest and almost double that of any other 8000+ meter peak (there are 14 total). In addition, there is only one instance of a climber having reached the summit more than once, whereas Everest had seen 299 repeats by the end of 1999.<br />The movie's main characters are a lawyer (Taylor) and his not as technically adept (but very close) climbing buddy who's a biophysicist (&quot;H&quot;--for Harold). Taylor and H have the most extraordinary friendship that withstands little spats, but connects on a deep level. Though H is not as talented a climber, he's every bit as sharp, making important contributions in various ways. However, he's never been in the &quot;death zone&quot; (approx. 25,000+ feet) before, and Taylor has...<br />While the climbing sequences aren't necessarily technically precise, they are certainly among the very best that have ever been filmed for a &quot;hollywood&quot;-style movie. It's a shame that (according to other reviews) this is not letterbox--I don't know how the movie could survive without some of the incredible scenes of panorama and expanse, from the initial big wall climbing to the ridge camp with sprawling glacier below to the summit moments. I saw this movie 5+ times on the big screen and--wow!<br />Two scenes in particular are powerful. In one, H has to &quot;sell&quot; his wife on his taking another trip, after making a promise to spend time at home with her and their toddler son. During this scene he finds himself making another promise anew--that he'll come back--for she knows of the mountain's deadly nature. The tension in making a promise after having broken others really spills onto the screen, but you believe that he's sincere. It is this scene where he tries with inadequate and searching though profound words, to describe what it means to him to be able to stand on the top of a mountain that has challenged him to give all that he's got. Amazing!<br />The other scene of note occurs high on the mountain in a tragic moment of realization for the two friends. I can't imagine a more poignant moment in all of film history--faced with consequences of actions set in motion in a distant place seemingly removed from time, and helpless to change their outcome; a soul-searching sorrowing and lamenting, and in the same moment the most altruistic and lofty of sentiments--it rips a soul apart, if one is open to it's deeper message.<br />On the basis of this movie, I started actively climbing; not to do what they did, nor to find some extreme way to express myself physically. I somehow related to the ideas presented, that solace and the development of inner strength through exposure to the challenges and sublimity of the mountains would yield in me a better soul--one that could soar in this world of limitations.<br />One final note. I spoke with the author of &quot;The Last Step&quot;, Rick Ridgeway--one of the first four Americans to summit in 1978 (the expedition upon which this movie was based). He was making a presentation at an REI flagship store in Denver and afterwards I asked him about this movie. He laughed, and said that he had been at the premier with the Japanese investors who underwrote the movie. He did mention that a scene where four climbers are lined up side by side on an ice wall with picks and crampons stabbing and crunching, and Pink Floyd-like rock music in the background beating, was &quot;not like it is at all!&quot; I guess Hollywood will always need to take some license...
B00009ATIX|3.0|i felt a certain amusement watching this movie. i think the director couldn't really understand the original film by andrei tarkovsky made years ago. i truly recommend watching the original film - a real world cinema treasure - first.
B00012QM8G|1.0|Read the reviews here about the no so desirable packaging and faulty disc. Remind me of the Back To The Future trilogy boo-boo. Boy! I ordered the Collector's Giftset and am worried now.
B000006NPY|5.0|How do you follow up the best-selling double album of recent times? Go the opposite way.<br />It's a shame that \\"Adore\\" didn't hold a firm place in the minds of critics and fans alike, because this was an album that contained more positives than negatives. Some see it as the album that took a new direction which propelled the Smashing Pumpkins' downfall. I see it as a showcase piece for the Smashing Pumpkins' musical versitality and visionary consistency. \\"Adore\\" was a new work in a new style, a kind of album that was a gutsy move from an always evolving band. However, not many bands are willing to reverse their signature sound that coincided in having to follow up a large success. This makes \\"Adore\\" even more historically interesting.<br />There's some kind of an intriguing phenomenon that surrounds this album. Gone is the angsty \\"Generation X\\" sound that plagued a lot of alt music in the 90's. Gone are the bloated excesses of the Mellon Collie/Aeroplane era. The album art does not contain any colors other than shades: black, white, and gray. It's new and innovative, melding together acoustic, electronic, piano, and lo-fi guitar to create a sound that is mature, organic, dreamy, dismal, and even nostalgic. It feels like a soundtrack to a 1930's art film. Billy's voice compliments the music instead of clashing with it, and contributes to the album's intimate mood. The songs such as \\"Ava Adore\\", \\"Behold! The Night Mare\\", and \\"For Martha\\" are all sonic pleasures for moments of solitude.<br />This is an overlooked masterwork that should've had its presence known. Those who only look for sweeping monster rockers will think \\"Adore\\" is a passive collection of songs. Those who think otherwise will realize the unique characteristics of this album and what the Smashing Pumpkins tried to contribute to a genre that was fading away from originality. 5 Stars.
0385504209|1.0|I was really excited to read this book, and was really dissapointed to find that it did not live up to the hype.  Dan Brown obviously did a lot of research to write the book and about the only thing that I found interesting was the art history.  The storyline is weak and somewhat boring.  The cliffhanger chapters get tiring after a while, and the end is unbelieveable and far-fetched.  It is extremely overrated and is probably one of the worst books I have ever read.
B00018D44U|5.0|Out of all the CD's ive gotten in a while this was a great one. And I mean a great one. This one deserves a grammy, no doubt about it. One great song on this CD is Sunrise. No matter how much i hear and home much radio play it gets, this song will not get old. Toes is also a very good song. Its got a good message and a great...well everything. <br />In other words buy this CD. Its worth it.
B00004NHCC|5.0|From the opening intro you know you are in for something accesible and new at the same time with this one.  I have listened sporadically to jazz since I was fifteen, I saw aging Gillespie and Basie live, and Ella and Joe Pass.  I got hooked on a label that focused on Ella, and never listened to much Sarah Vaughan.  I just have to say that this early stuff rocks(or Jazzes, I guess).  The aforementioned first cut just cruises along is such a heartstoppingly beautiful way...for me, no music does this to me like Jazz.  I listen to a lot of stuff(though I hate when people blow their own horn about how eclectic their musical tastes are...yeah yeah, get over yourself) I can think of no other music that creates these time stopping moments for me like jazz does.  The first cut, lullaby of Birdland does this several times...it creates absloutely breathtaking moments, the opening intro, the absolutely spare backup, allowing total support for master vocals....the scatting, and then this great point where Sarah sings in front of a rythmic arrangement...it is magical for me.<br />Oh yes, there is the rest of the music, which wails and ballads it's way into every nook and cranny of ones romantic soul.  When Sarah sings Embraceable You, you want to come to mama(that is a lyric..) (oh that great moment is coming up..........don't you love it)<br />Gotta figure it out for yourself...but chances are you will want to embrace someone yourself when you listen to it...<br />or want to go to birdland, or experience Paris<br />it's an emotional travelogue of the map of the jazzy heart.
B00018D3RI|5.0|The quality of the restoration goes without saying, these episodes and our beloved cop team never looked so goood!<BR>For anyone who never had the pleasure of experiencing this show the first time around, you'll love it!   The other reviewers have covered all the usual comments, so read those for more on the episodes, etc... My husband and I are big fans from back in the day, but the pleasant surprise is our 8 year old son, who has been hooked for the last 3 years on episodes aired by TNT on occasion.  This DVD is a fun family nite for us all!   <BR> I would like to focus on the AMAZING packaging job on this collection!  It's a wonderful surprise, and I don't want to spoil it !  I'll just say the graphics and subject matter could not be better, as we all know there's a third star in this show....<br />I can only hope Season Two is next on the list!
B00018TI5E|5.0|When I was thinking of purchasing this album, I had read that this was really nothing like any of the Red Hot Chili Peppers music. The Chili Peppers are one of my favorite groups currently, but as I listen to Shadows now, I realise that this is something completely different. It is stunning, and possibly groundbreaking, but it's John Frusciante at his best. Definitely worth all five stars.
B0001UZZWW|5.0|If this movie is released in field sequential 3d than this gets 5 stars, if they release Field Sequential 3D and Color Code 3D in a combo pack then this will be better than gold. Field Sequential 3D has a slight flicker if you have glasses with a lite tint, best on the computer but very awesome on the tv. Color Code is kind of new, it is patented so not to many people use it yet, the glasses are amber and dark blue, these work great as well, colors due look a little funny though still VERY watchable. Hard to describe but it doesn't have the bad effect that the analglyph glasses due (red and cyan or red and green) I can't even sit 5 minutes with those on- just aweful! If this movie is released with the red and blue or the black and clear glasses then don't buy it and don't give it any stars! Write them to make it in a field sequential/Color Code combo, the cool thing is all animated films can be turned into these formats they just need to know you want it!

B000002UJQ|5.0|There are some Albums that can change your outlook on music, life, and move you so much to the point where you cannot stop listening to that album. While there are few albums that very great, I would have to say this is one of those albums. <br />First off, I was into a lot of electronica, and also loved most Rock music when I first listened to this album. If you like either of those genres you should give this album a try deffinatly, if you like one but not the other, you should still try it. Radiohead is not a band for everyone, there are deep metiphorical meanings in the lyrics, and strange vocals and music. <br />I am a big Radiohead fan, and I would say this is there most well rounded album, if your new to Radiohead, I would suggest checking this one out first. <br />Every single song is genious. Once I started listening I couldnt stop. I dont think words can fully tell what this album is really like. Usually its either a hit or miss if you like Radiohead or not, you love them or hate them. I personally love them, and would suggest giving the album a try. It takes a bunch of listens for fully comprehend what the album really is, so don't expect to love it the first time, it grows on you. <br />One of my favorite CD's to date.
0385507755|5.0|Kelly Krisler, a graduate student,<BR>Simply put, I really liked \\"A Million Little Pieces.\\" I agree with the review comparisons to \\"Nightmares Echo,\\" \\"Running With Scissors,\\" and of course \\"My Fractured Life.\\" I also would include \\"Less Than Zero\\" among the favorable comparisons. Although a fiction novel in comparison to \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" being a memoir, \\"Less Than Zero\\" deals with the same situations of poor little rich boy becoming an addict not because of life on the mean streets, but simply because he has the money to waste. In terms of impact though, it is hard to top \\"Nightmares Echo\\" or \\"Basketball Diaries.\\" Whereas, it in terms of an addictive reading experience it is hard to top \\"My Fractured Life\\" and \\"Running With Scissors\\". In all cases, \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" deserving belongs among all the aforementioned. It is graphic and impacting and at the same time addictive to read. A gripping journey that will put knots in your stomach.
B000005ALP|5.0|I heard of (E) through watching the movie Levity. I liked the style of his playing and singing, so I thought I would check him out. I got Beautiful Freak and I am currently listening to it through the first time, and already love it.<br />The music and the styles are very diverse, which I love, yet the whole album does maintain a laid back feel. I'm all about experimentation so that was a big plus for me. <br />The lyrics are another amazing aspect. They are very sarcastic, strait to the point, and even laugh out loud funny sometimes. I love his ability to write something so &quot;real&quot;, listen for yourself to truely understand what I am saying. The vocal style is also very nice, very Beck. <br />While this CD is awesome, I would say it would not appeal to everyone. If your not into experimental stuff, then you should probably look elsewhere, but if you enjoy something original, this is a treat for ears to listen to.
B00018D3RI|5.0|What an incredible journey back to the most magical time in the history of buddy shows! Recapture the very essence of everything that this show stood for, beautiful friendship, caring, love, laughter, honor and trust...<br /> The action and adventure is still there, but most of all, the relationship that rocked Hollywood with its beauty and its warmth. It's all here in the first season.<br /> Tip your hats to Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul for having the courage and the heart to give the spirit of humanity to these characters!
B00003003R|5.0|This album reminds us of the band that made 80s rock! &quot;when they were good&quot;, this album shows highlights from from all of there albums and it really does make it hard to imagine a band this good can fall apart SLASH shines on this cd axls vocals are dodgy in places but great keyboards by dizzy reed. Also check out Its alright, originally written by black sabbath guns n roses do a good job here. Its worth the 20 quid, best of the best!
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown has written a fine little book here. He broaches alot of interesting ideas that encourage people to go out and read more, and I am ALL ABOUT getting people to read more! Now, that said, some of the ideas in the book he puts forward as fact and are not and then some of the ideas that are factual are misrepresented in the book. I guess we'll just have to call it creative license. So when you read the book, don't just swallow it all hook, line, and sinker! REMEMBER: It is fiction.<br />Dan Brown's writing was good, not amazing, not breathtaking, not extraordinary, just good. There was nothing impressive about his structure either, pretty formulaic, the plot flowed pretty well and even and the pages kept turning as the interest built. The worst I can say about his style is that he keeps alluding to the mysteries behind the characters way too much. Like Sophie has a dark secret. He doesnt mention it just once or twice, at least 20 or 30 times you read something like &quot;..and sophie again thinks on that terrible dark secret.&quot; And i just feel like strangling the author, &quot;Tell me or shut the hell up!&quot; he does eventually tell you, but you'll have it figured out way prior.<br />Altogether, though, a good read, a good conversation type book that could be a gateway to interests you never knew you had!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Although this series has been way too often advertised as simply a &quot;Western-SF&quot; it is so much more than that.<BR>It's honestly the best television I have seen in forever, it has such great writing, acting, effects and just such a great overall feel to it, it's simply amazing. It's also very refreshing to see a &quot;sience fiction&quot;, wich doesn't revolve around sience and aliens and the like, but just about the people. This makes the series probably more a drama than anything else, only in a just so much more creative setting.<BR>Really even if you don't like SF at all, there is a very good chance that you'll get hooked only halveway trough the pilot.<br />The DVD set itself is very complete, 50% of all the episodes have commentaries (wich are very nice), and there are quite a few other intresting extra's (just Joss Whedon singing the (by the way briliant) theme song, and Adam Baldwin's verson of &quot;the Hero of Canton&quot; make this DVD set worth the purcase). <BR>And although there are only 14 episodes this set will over you ages of viewing pleasure, every episode deserves to be watch dozens of time, you'll be amazed at how many detals you keep discovering.<br />Thereare only two bad thing about this series:<BR>1 - It's way to short, this 'verse' coulda gone on for ever, and by the time you'll seen all the episodes, it leaves you very sad and angry that there aren't anymore (so you'll just continu to watch them over and over agian)<BR>2 - It will make (almost) every other television series look cheap, uninventive and boring.<br />Now you could go on and read all the other 700+ reviews, of wich 99.9% are positive or you could just order this set, and enjoy it, untill the movie is released (yup,for those of you who don't know yet, there'll be a movie about this series in 2005 called Serenity)
B00008EY7H|5.0|We recently watched La Nouba at Orlando, FL.  It was our first live - Cirque du Soleil.  We watched a documentary on PBS and it wasn't that impressive.  However, from many people's recommendation, we watched the live show and it was just breath taking!  Cirque du Soleil has very talented people doing very unique tricks, and with very artistic classy presentations and costumes.  So we bought Alegria DVD, because of their extra documentary (it was good with performers).  The DVD Alegria show was so much more than what we expected.  The camera did a very excellent job.  They did rock concerts so they were experienced and know how to present this show well on TV.  It wasn't same as live, but it was still amazing at a good price.  Also, I liked the different view from the camera (i.e. from the top view).  Vocal and music were great, with a pair of good speakers.  This DVD is worth to keep if you like these kind of stuff.
B000000OXH|5.0|While the debut album was brilliant, it had a real clunker of a song (One Step Closer) which sounded like Steve Howe (a great guitarist, but at best a background singer) tried to sing it, but was overdubbed by John Wetton. ALPHA is more consistent. Every song is a keeper. The best tracks are: Midnight Sun, My Own Time, The Heat Goes On and best of all, Open Your Eyes - an art-rock tear-jerker that would make Justin Hayward proud!<br />While the opening track (Don't Cry) is an upbeat pop-song the album becomes angrier and sadder with each song except for Midnight Sun. <br />What's even sadder is the fact that just a few months after ALPHA was released, singer/ bassist John Wetton was fired from the group by manager Brian Lane. Apparently, guitarist Steve Howe (like Lane, a YES-man) resented the fact that while Asia was at first considered Howe's band, it was John Wetton who was the star of the show: Wetton, not Howe was invited to host on MTV, radio interviews, etc. Even when Wetton returned in 1984 (and repaid Howe by sacking him), the magic was gone. A textbook example of &quot;Jumping the shark&quot;.
B000002H70|5.0|I would put 'Disintegration' by the Cure, in my top 5 favorite albums of all time, but not just that... in the top 5 musically greatest albums ever made...<br />There isnt one bad song on the album... &amp; most of the songs are long - This album is a high contender for the most depressing album ever... but dont let that discourage you, theres tremendous strength behind the depression in this album, an urge to &quot;fight back&quot; against how horrible the world can feel at times... <br />I cant even count in my head by now the number of times ive walked around at night listening to the song 'Disintegration' (the best song on the album) with my headphones on, getting encouragement from the 9 minuteish long song, with fantastic lyrics, building in intensity along the way to the point where youll either cry or come close to passing out<br />If i had to rate every song on this album on a scale between 1-10... most of the songs would be 9-10, &amp; the rest would be 7-8... No average songs on this album, just an amazing display of emotion, &amp; the power that comes from suffering &amp; wisdom in isolation<br />Robert Smith has given something to music lovers thats priceless , timeless, &amp; immortal
6304779356|5.0|For those who are &quot;traumatized&quot; and find this movie &quot;horrible,&quot; please step back for a second and realize this was released in 1987. I don't think this was actually meant to stand up to todays vampire movies. Back then, it had a great cast. Kiefer Sutherland (Always a favorite), Jamie Gertz (Gotta love Stars outfits), Jason Patric (pulls off the part well), and The Coreys (Nothing needs to be said about The Coreys. Pure 80's magic.) I didn't and still don't expect this movie to be some cinematic wonder, so for what 'The Lost Boys' is, it's a great movie. I would recommend it to anyone who fell in love with movies from the middle 80's and early 90's. For all you people who expect something like, &quot;Blade&quot; or &quot;Interview with a Vampire,&quot; please take a moment to think about how the times and special effects have changed. I will always love this movie and it will hold a special place in my life forever.
0441009425|1.0|I really, really wanted to like it.  I love hard sci fi, and Reynolds is a PhD.  And I love time-spanning past/future space yarns.<br />But this was a pale imitation of Benford's superior &quot;Galactic Center&quot; six-book series -- it pretty much told the same story of a cocky explorer and how his discovery of an odd set of alien artifacts led to a major threat to human civilization and a solution to the riddle of why there is so little other intelligent life in the galaxy.  I'll leave it at that to avoid giving it all away.<br />Also, the writing was odd and, at times, poor.  I can accept cool sci fi stories that aren't Hemingway -- Steven Baxter, for example, tells tales as good as Benford's, just with clumsier writing.  But Reynolds has some strange and flat-out incorrct habits, like using semicolons where he should be using commas.<br />In short, stick to Benford, Baxter, or Greg Bear for your space and hard sci fi needs.  It's one thing for a prolific author to eventually/occasionally produce something derivatve, but when your first book is pretty darned uncreative, that's a bad sign for your writing career.  At least he has a PhD to fall back on.

They once stood as one of the most amazing, phenominal, emotional acts around, but now have resorted to pop based androgonous rock.<br />Stockholm Sydnrome stands as a testament to TRUE muse, with Apocalypse please following almost. However songs such as Thoughst of a dying athiest &amp; hysteria stray from the godly emotion withheld in Matthew Bellamy, and with Sing for absolution, it virtually destroys the album.<br />Very dissapointing.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Was a great movie, slow but serene. Give viewers a good intro into what travellers can expect when one goes to Tokyo; a disco, the way to KaraOK, the video game outlet, topless bar and typical night life a traveller could get.  In subtle ways it unravel a romantic hotel stay in real life situation.  Good movie.
B000000OQF|5.0|One of the greatest albums of all time.<br />Urgent, Fierce, Dangerous, and Transcendent, like the \\"Who\\" two decades before, and the reason this album is still sound-scanning 5,000 copies a month almost 18 years after it was recorded!<br />...<br />GnR is simply the truth!
B00008H2LB|1.0|Lets take a look at the past 10 or so years in heavy metal shall we?  In the early 90s, Korn puts out their first album, which is admittedly pretty damn good.  Was it really necessary to milk the concept of no guitar riffs, unimaginative and totally childish lyrics, total lack of talent to such a degree that we end of with Meterora from Linkin Park?  This is the downfall right here folks, kids are praying for it more than anyone apparently.  Linkin Park is just terrible, how can you not see that kids.  And the fact they tour with Metallica, well theres another review in itself.  I give up and will need to find some other kind of music to listen to.
6305603847|5.0|I am a big Floyd fan, and this movie (along with the CD) was something else. It tells the story of a man called PINK who has had such an awful childhood and life that he has built up walls (not real ones, mental ones) between him and the real world. Even though this movie is good, I didn't understand one single part of it. My favorite scene was the Another Brick in the Wall part 2 sequence, where the children destroy the school. (...) I totally wanna do that to my school!\\" The animated sequences are brilliant too. let me just warn you, this movie is violent, gruesom, frightening, (...)but all in all. I give it A+, two thumbs up, and a scratch on my head because I have no idea what the hell is going on.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|A young teacher, with a boyfriend comes to a prestigious school to teach.  She is intimated the first day when she meets her classmates.  A bunch of girls with enormous IQ's sit in the room, dictating word for word from books.  <br />Mona teaches Art 101 and makes plans to show the girls that art is more than reading a book or seeing it just once.  She takes them to look at different pieces of art detailing the masterpiece. <br />In the day, the girls were infatuated with finding a husband so they could get married.  Betty was so excited she was married, and her studying habits got worse.  Betty thought she was in love, but obviously wasn't.  <br />Mona shows the girls there is more to life than just getting married.  She hands an application to a girl to try to get her into Yale school of law.  She applies, is accepted, but decides to get married and live her dream.  <br />The movie is inspirational and shows that women can do anything that they dream of.  We are not meant to just &quot;clean the house or wash dishes&quot;.  We have brains of our own that can exceed outer limits and change the world forever.  This movie gave me that feeling.
B0001932ZA|4.0|Running Man was a story originally written by Stephen King (under the pen name Richard Bachman).  The book focuses on a man who lives in an impoverished society who participates in a manhunt reality show to get money to care for his ill child.  The story takes place over a variety of locations.  The movie on the otherhand is somewhat different.  It takes place in a closed location as a reality gameshow like Dog Eat Dog or Fear Factor.  The main character is a helicopter pilot for the military who was wrongfully accused.<br />Even though the book has more of a suspense drama feel to it than the action-based film, the film is not without its merits.  It is almost a Nostradamus premonition to what we are seeing today.  We are in the grip of reality.  The reality show is now the bread and butter to TV.  The best part about the film is that grip is there when you watch it.  I recommend this film, its fun, its entertaining, and the best part is that it is not REAL.<br />The new DVD version has great features on it and two feature length commentaries.  The only thing I did not like is the documentary on privacy after 9/11.  It was extremely politically biased.  It was almost a propaganda film in my opinion.  I myself see no problem in surveillance after 9/11, and I believe those who do see a problem probably have something to hide......
B000089RVX|1.0|You heard me all you wannabe goths, this is stupid crap. The singer sounds like some chick that is on her . plus the guitarist and drummer can't play if their life depended on it. It is simply illogical as to wht you people listen to this garbage, it sucks! Some Nu-Metal bands are good, but this is not one of them.<br />Send me hate mail, my e-mail is Auragorn@aol.com hahaha.
0792833201|5.0|When I saw this film when is was about 20, it scared the guts out of me, now 24 years later, it isn't as scary but still keeps me thrilled.  I watch this movie so many times and I never get scared of it.  Alot of people out there like it too, only a few think it isn't that great.  Everyone asks me why is this movie PG and I have 2 things to say to that<BR>1. Back in 1982 PG-13 wasn't a rating<BR>2. It couldn't have been R because it has no frontal nudity and rarley and swears.<BR>So, I hope that answers your question.  Anyway, this film even thou PG is not for kids.  It may be a bit to scary and intense for younger viewers.  A part that still scares the heck out of me is when the clown pops up and another part that scares me is when the guy is in the bathroom and he's ripping of all his skin.  It may look a little fake, but what do you expect, it was made 22 years ago.  This movie should be in any movie collectors shelf, even if your not a big fan of horror films cause this movie is for movie likers of the age 9 and up.  So, go ahead and get this movie, it's worth every penny and will remain a gem in any one's shelf.<BR>10/10<BR>Rated PG for strong graphic violence, language, brief nudity and mild gore.
B00005221M|1.0|I agree with the reviewers above.  The so-called &quot;Directors Expanded Edition&quot; is an absolute disgrace.  Mann has managed to destroy a perfectly good film.  If you can find the theatrical release on DVD or VHS, I suggest that you purchase it while you still can!  Good Luck (you'll need it)!
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic is unquestionably Nasty Nas' best album.  Not It Was Written, Stillmatic, nor God's Son.  Nas released this album at the age of 21.  It featured production from the legendary DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Large Professor, and L.E.S.  Now into the review.<br />The album starts off with a short intro called &quot;The Genesis&quot;.  Then it proceeds into &quot;NY State of Mind&quot;.  This song in my opinion, is lyrically Nas' best song ever.  Just check out the first couple of bars of the first verse.  Nas' internal rhyme scheme rivals that of Rakim himself.  DJ Premier provides a rugged beat that goes perfectly with Nas' lyrics.  Next is &quot;Life's a B***h&quot; featuring AZ.  The production on this track is just marvelous.  AZ and Nas also come correct.  AZ's flow and lyrics are just perfect on this song, Nas' are good too but AZ ends up stealing the show.  This song is followed by &quot;The World is Yours&quot;.  Production by my favorite producer of all time Pete Rock.  Nas' lyrics on this song are meant to inspire young and poor people in the NY area.  One of my favorite songs on the LP.  &quot;Halftime&quot; is just amazing.  The beat is addictive and Nas' lyrics come off strong as usual.  &quot;Memory Lane&quot; is my favorite song on the entire album.  The production on this song is flawless and it's just a track you can vibe to.  This is one that you could put on repeat and just relax.  On &quot;One Love&quot; Nas raps about those who are in prison.  He gives a shout out to many, including future arch rival Cormega.  Q-Tip does the hook for this song.  The next song, &quot;One Time 4 Your Mind&quot; is my least favorite on the album.  The production is kind of on the weak side and Nas' lyrics are good but his flow is off a bit.  This is the track that I sometimes skip.  &quot;Represent&quot; was a street anthem.  The uptempo beat by DJ Premier makes this one a favorite of those who need to get hyped.  &quot;It Ain't Hard to Tell&quot; is the final trackon the album.  Lyrically, this song is only surpassed by &quot;NY State of Mind&quot;.  You can hear the sample of Michael Jackson's &quot;Human Nature&quot; built into the song.  Lines like &quot;From the spliff that I lift and inhale&quot; makes this one a true gem.  I remember seeing this video on TV back when BET used to play good music.<br />Illmatic is a true classic and a must have for any hip-hop fan.  Even if you don't like Nas you should have this album.  There are only a few shortcomings on the LP.  It's on the short side,  only about 40 minutes total.  I personally like longer albums better just so long as they don't have any filler tracks.  You won't find any truly wack songs on Illmatic.  One Time 4 Your Mind isn't as strong as the other songs but it's not completely wack either.  Everyone, I recommend you buy this album.
B00012FXB8|3.0|I find Alien 3 a lot more watchable than Alien Ressurrection. The bad thing about it is that it kills off all the interesting characters of the first 2 movies. Carrie Heine as Newt was adorable and her and Sigourney Weaver had great chemestry. Michael Biehn (Terminator) was great as a soldier named Hicks and Lance Henrikson was very good as an android. So what does Alien 3 do ? It kills them all off. Ripley arrives on a prison planet as the only survivor on her ship. An alien was also on board of course and guess what ? Ripley has one inside her. Another alien comes out of a dog to cause some havoc. There's no guns on the planet so they have to figure out how to kill it....and it takes them the whole movie to figure that out. If it wasn't for the cool set designs, good direction and good performances by Weaver and Charles Dutton the movie would've been a total waste. Hell it's still 100 times better than the last one though.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a beautiful movie about communication. How the differing history and mindset of people make it hard to understand and relate to eachother. Also, without a good way to communicate, people distance eachother and make caricatures of their environment. This is why the movie in the beginning emphasizes the problems the japanese director and Bob have without a proper interpreter. Why the young girl and Bob connected was because they were both in the same situation in life. The age difference didnt matter because they could communicate and understood eachother. I dont think the movie is boarderline racist. Coppola presents the asian people like that because that are our own prejudices. Illustrating the point even more. This is not a movie for everybody. If you are in for an emotional and thoughtful movie I would very much recommend it. It was one of the top 5 movies last year.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I pesonaly like Ghibli studio movies because they are out of ordinary or make ordinary look unordinary. Like &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; or original &quot;Naussica&quot;(pardon if spelled wrong)anyway this 1 is a great follower because it is very good like animation extras on dvd and story itself.<br />I am sure u read all the story from other reviews but just to refresh ur memory its about a little 10 year old girl who exidentaly ends up in spirit world tough luck kiddo. Her parents were turned in pigs for certain reasons and herself she starts to work for the spirit hotel in order not to be a pig herself as far as apropriance for kidds i dont think its anything bad to see.<BR>And the plot is well i dont realy know cause i am not much in plot stuff its basicly a selfish and stuborn girl goes through changes in charachter. What i mean is she goes from saying &quot;NOT FAIR&quot; to &quot;Thank you very much&quot;. Over all movie is almost perfect and i see no flaws cause i am not picky 5 stars babe!<BR>P.S.<br />Realy although movie is good without a question just rent and find out save some money if not like the movie in outcome.
0440238609|5.0|This is an extraordinarily subtle and complex exploration of the journey from childhood to adult.  The themes of the modern world (science run amok, put to evil ends, environmentalism, religious fanaticism etc.) are skilfully interwoven with stories as old as the Illiad (the journey, the search for home, the loss of innocence, the meaning of death).<br />Yes it is anti-religious, or at least anti the formal human interpretation of religion: Pope John Calvin, indeed ;-).  But it is also a profoundly spiritual book about the great journeys we make in life: from innocence to knowledge, from life to death, to a recognition that we are all mixes of good and evil.  It's about first love, and losing first love.<br />The background is Milton's 'Paradise Lost'.  <br />It resonates with all of us because this is the journey each of us took to go from childhood to adolescence to adulthood: learning that people change, that good people can do bad things, that sometimes we are those good people doing bad things, learning the wonders (and perils) of making love, that we gain lovers, and lose them, that people will love very much will be lost to us through death.<br />It is a wonderful book for a teenager, struggling with all that stuff, and for us, as adults, who have made that journey and are probably still a little confused by it.<br />Probably of all the 'children's' fiction I have read, only Lord of the Rings had the same sense of wonder and also the same taste of the bittersweet.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Here's a question. Why can those who write negative reviews not use the word &quot;art&quot; without turning it into &quot;artsy-fartsy&quot;. <br />Surely a movie needs no apology for being art. Far from it. I am sick and disgusted with movies that make no attempt at art whatsoever and just aim at being bulk-fodder for the lowest common denominator.<br />As far as I'm concerned, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a great movie. Maybe it does show &quot;art&quot; in its making. If that's a good thing to you I'll doubt you'll be put off by it. For those who can see it holds many treasures. For those who can't, well &quot;you can lead a horse to water....&quot;
B00005V9HH|1.0|when i rented this movie i thought that it would be something that was at least watchable.  but it wasn't.  i can now honestly say that i fell asleep during a movie.  go ahead say this was a terrible review im just writing this to lower it's ratings so somebody doesn't waste their money buying or even renting it before they see it.  this movie was boring, stupid, a waste of talent, poor directing, bad storyline, and a pointless plot.  if you want to see a good movie see Fight Club or something, don't waste your money or even time on this piece of trash.
B000063DFN|5.0|&quot;Powerslave&quot; by Iron Maiden is one of the best cds of all time. Each song is absoulutely top-notch.

Wait, that is the whole cd! That is just my point. Go buy this now!
B0000035E7|1.0|Admit it: There were hundreds of of creative bands out there before, after, and during Nirana's nearly 13-year-and-counting stranglehold on the music world. They're still popular ten years after Cobain gave himself a shotgun facelift because kids these days are too lazy to go out and re-discover the amazing music of the past that they missed while in their mother's womb. Nirvana was never creative or experimental. I've heard every single one of their albums, the 1987 KAOS show, and their first show they ever played in March of 1987 in Raymond, WA. Simply put, the band blows dog. Same goes for their 1/23/88 gig they did after their Endino session. And do you know what Kurt opened the show with? He said to the audience, &quot;I have a big white di_k&quot;. Nice opener for such an &quot;artist&quot; who was against macho posturing, huh? If you ever get to hear the Raymond 1987 show, it'll turn any Nirvana fan into a non-fan, as will 1/23/88. The playing is so bad that it's interesting--interesting to see that Nirvana (or Throat Oyster, or Ted Ed Fred, or Pen Cap Chew, or Brown Cow) was always so ammature. Nirvana never were as good as Nevermind portrays them to be, and the actual extent of their playing ability is found on the crapfest that is Bleach. Mumbling lines like &quot;Smell the smell&quot; and &quot;Pee-pee pressed against my lips&quot; do not get my creative juices flowing, nor do they inspire me to do anything besides crush the damn Bleach record, which I did. It p*sses me off to no end that Kurt Cobain is still wrongfully hailed a genius, while thousands of amazing songs have went under the radar due to the fact he wrongly overshadows the music industry with his music that nobody can relate to. Kurt Cobain wrote music for himself and nobody else. Nobody (not even a fan) can relate to someone like Kurt who didn't want to be related with. You may say you an relate to him, but since he would never reciprocate that adoration, you can't relate to him. He didn'twant admiration; he just wanted to sit in the corner like he did a his own Nevermind release party and distance himself from everyone. He wanted to be forgotton, so just let the curmudgeon stay to himself in hell. Ever heard of They Might Be Giants, Bow Wow Wow, PIL, Talking Heads, The B-52's, The Fixx, Missing Persons, or Concrete Blond? Didn't think so.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I was going to write my normal format of review, and then realized there isn't much can be reviewed. The story is very simple, like many early Chinese kung-fu movie. There is only one theme: revenge. Uma Thurman is set out revenge for her being shot and her lost baby. Uma Thurman is going to kill Bill-her former boss and the one who sent her into a coma; and she is going to kill him and everyone who is standing between her and him. You kill me, and I will kill you. Just like that.<br />And since there isn't much of story, the whole movie is a showcase of how to tell a story. Or rather, see how Uma kill. You will get a mixed of fist fighting, knife fighting, kung-fu fighting, and samurai sword fighting. The whole movie is placed in a totally different world from ours. For example, I doubt you will see people carrying their big samurai sword onto an airplane. <br />Anyways, this is a highly stylized movie, you will see black and white, Hong Kong wired works, Japanese anime, yakuza showdown...all Asian influences. The movie is simply outrageous-action film in its simplest, purest form. And all is exciting.<br />You will see when people bleed, they don't just bleed. Their blood shoot out like a jet; the blood will shoot up to the ceiling and coming down like rain. People will bath in blood, literally. <br />And the final showdown at a snow-falling Japanese garden, two beautiful women (Uma & Lucy) waving big samurai swords, fighting with flamingo music is just too erotic. <br />It is not a movie that will win awards, or to be discussed afterwards over a coffee. But it is fun and exciting to watch. The audience not only cheered for Uma, but gave a round of applauds after. That is pretty rare if you considering this is a \\"B\\" movie. <br />Go see Uma kill Bill.<br />(...)
0671027387|3.0|I loved The DaVinci Code, although I had trouble with one big twist near the end.  While the latter issue did frustrate me, there was unquestionably magic in that book.  The DaVinci Code made you feel like you were learning a miraculous secret, and it was just credible enough (whether it really is true or not) to be very satisfying.<br />Notwithstanding its NASA theme, Deception Point, on the other hand, is squarely grounded on earth.  Mr. Brown's signature detail is less impressive when it's about weapons and oceanography, as compared to ancient, religious \\"secrets.\\"  Tom Clancy has taught us more than we need to know about aircraft parts and Jacque Cousteau has left indelible images of plankton on our minds.  As a result, Dan's long \\"factual\\" passages just don't deliver this time.<br />The action will make for good movie preview highlights some day (a la Will Smith's \\"Independence Day\\" exterior White House scene), but whether the \\"baddie\\" in Deception Point could ever be that bad, on American soil, requires a modern day cynicism that I just couldn't muster.  The notion that American special forces would gleefully follow some of these orders was just too far-fetched to be fun.<br />On the upside, I thought Dan Brown captured nicely the tension between Senator Sexton (running for President) and his daughter, the heroine and heart-throb of the book.  Those characters were very nicely developed, and I enjoyed all of their scenes very much.  Same for the Senator and his beautiful chief aid.  Rachel's love-interest theme was a bit two-dimensional, but I liked the way it was wrapped up in a very human, understated way.<br />Overall, Deception Point doesn't get far off the ground, but it has some very enjoyable moments on earth.
B00000K29E|5.0|In response to &quot;A Music Fan&quot;...first, I'm sitting here looking at the original vinyl release of Big Brother and the Holding Company (Columbia Special Products Division)...and it is entitled &quot;Big Brother and the Holding Company featuring Janis Joplin&quot;...so the re-issue is in fact true to the original release.  Second, although the reviewer is correct in pointing out that the &quot;bonus tracks&quot; were on the original release (in the order that &quot;A Music Fan&quot; indicated), they were not listed on the album jacket!!  &quot;Coo Coo&quot; appears on side one, track 6 but is not listed on the outer jacket...it was a psychedelic precursor to the &quot;bonus track&quot;...same with &quot;The Last Time,&quot; it appears on side two, track 6 but is not listed on the album jacket.<BR>     Nevertheless, a great record that reveals a developing young talent on the threshold of stardom...
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is definitely one of the best hip-hop CDs to hit the streets in years. It's amazing how relevant a song like &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; is when you consider the success of &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot; Kanye must have known something that we didn't. <br />This album has soul, and most rap CDs can't claim that. \\"College Dropout\\" is really a mixture of hip-hop and R&amp;B that is blended to perfection. Kanye pulled of a modern-day miracle when he decided to record this album. The perfect example is \\"Through the Wire.\\" I mean, how do you make a David Foster classic better? You don't! But he did. And very few could have succeeded at the level that he does. That song in the wrong hands could have been a disaster. And this illustrates my point exactly. Kanye had the talent to pull this off.<br />I haven't seen this much effort put into a recording in awhile. He set the bar for himself pretty high. The raps are borderline prose or prose poetry. This is impressive. Each song is like a short story instead of a poem. If anyone deserves a Grammy nom for Album of the Year, it's Kanye West.
0671027387|4.0|AS in the DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons the action takes place in one long day. The good news about this is there really is little time to develop characters.  The books are a wild ride in every available method of transportation.<br />It is natural to compare this effort to the two mentioned above.  It is a weak third.  The style is the same, a long day with the unknown person until the end driving the action.  The problem with this book is the escapes were even more hard to believe, the scenarion was less believable, the escapes were outlandish  and the ending was more contrived. Having said all of that I must admit it was fun to read.
0425180638|2.0|I waited for a while to say this.  Every author can have a bad book or two.  The transitional focus change from what might be seen as a bit more action to a reflective deeper character frankly flopped.  I don't care not because the character isn't worth it but because the author doesn't carry it off.<br />After reading the following books I wondered if this wasn't the first attempt to save something the author had grown bored with and serial characters can become boring.  Other authors have started this transition leading to Best Sellers with only a few grunts of &quot;no&quot; from a few die hard fans of the other version of the writing.  Branching off into other works is also a trait.  The following books were way below standard for her.  So far below I don't bother to even look to see if anything new is coming out nor do I buy them used when they do.<br />Read this? Yes.  It might be Kay's real farewell to us all.
0385510438|4.0|The Last Juror seems to show Grisham's change as an author.  In his early works he wrote suspense stories.  In The Last Juror the suspense which is secondary to the development of wonderful characters.  Miss Callie is a wonderful woman who shows how a powerful force for good can make her whole family better.  It is worth reading this book just to meet her.  <br />The rest of the small town characters such as Harry Rex and Baggy as well as Will himself and his grandmother are wonderfully drawn.   <br />Some reviewers have commented that the book lacked suspense.  It seems that Grisham is moving in his work.  Rather than a fast moving book such as Angels and Demons with little character development, Grisham is now writing slower moving books with wonderful characters.  The Testament and the King of Torts are examples.   I think that the new Grisham is every bit as enjoyable as the early Grisham but just a little different.
B000002JS8|5.0|AC/DC at their best! I have seen them live, but never like this.... a DVD all AC/DC fans should own.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Wow, this movie was very boring.  The whole movie was nothing but scenes put together of two boring people doing nothing in Japan.  There was a scene that was about 3 or 4 minutes long that showed nothing but Bill Murray's character trying to golf.  It wasn't funny, and had nothing to do with the movie.  Also, this movie makes the Japanese look like they're stupid, which is definitely not true.  It also portrays Japan as a boring, terrible place, which it is not.  My whole family hated this movie, and said that it was one of the most boring ones that they had ever seen.  I don't get why this movie was rated so high with critics, and why it got any nominations at all at any of the award shows.  It was boring, unfunny, overhyped, and was lost in stupid scene after scene.

McCartney did a good job with his efforts except for the queer \\"Martha My Dear\\" and  \\"Why Dont We Do It In The Road\\"....that song is just stupid. They threw their usual bone to Ringo per album with 2 tracks..\\"Good Night\\" and the Ringo Starr written \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" which aren't bad.  John Lennon's contribution to this album is a big disappointment...I DO like \\"Dear Prudence\\" \\"Glass Onion\\" \\"I'm So Tired\\" and \\"Julia\\" .....but \\"Yer Blues\\" is badly written and awful guitar by Lennon. \\"Revolution 9\\" is just noise. \\"Bungalow Bill\\" is annoying as hell. The slow version of \\"Revolution\\" was a bad choice...shoo be do wop???? \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey\\" has a good rockin groove to it...but the lyrics are lame and the the song title is a little long and stupid. \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" is OK but not great...........George Harrison clearly OUTSHINES Lennon and McCartney on The White Album....\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" \\"Savoy Truffle\\" \\"Piggies\\" \\"Long,Long,Long\\" are Harrison classics. He came a long way from the lame 1963 clunker \\"Don't Bother Me\\" (he was only 19 or 20 when he wrote that). He leaves off from  his strong songwriting from Revolver (he was equally as good as John and Paul on that album). His only  contribution to Sgt Pepper \\"Within You, Without You\\" is very good while being sitar drenched and heavily Indian influenced. \\"Blue Jay Way\\" from Magical Mystery Tour was NOT his best... His stuff on the goofy Yellow Submarine album  was GREAT! \\"Only a Northern Song\\" \\"It's All Too Much\\" are Harrison gems..........The White Album would have been great if they ditched the Honey Pie's ,the lame Lennon stuff, and \\"Martha My Dear\\"......  Basically the \\"White Album\\" is half good and half bad. ....The reason the Beatles made it a double album and named it \\"The Beatles\\" is because at the time they thought it was going to be their last album.... Thank God they made the wonderful Abbey Road and Let It Be.
B000197LR0|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever recorded. I didn't know what to expect after hearing the &quot;King of Fools&quot; EP. But rest assured, this is Edguy's at its best. The songs are ten times heavier than in the past, and still catchy like a dangerously contagious cold. By the second time you listen to any of the songs, you'll already be singing along. The production is excellent, the lyrics are thoughtful and poetic, and the music: well, they added a full orchestra for this CD! Prepare to hear violins beautifully interwoven with guitars. The song &quot;The Spirit Will Remain&quot; is a complete surprise! It has incredibly epic music accompanied by Tobias's soaring vocals. I only wish that &quot;New Age Messiah&quot; was on his CD instead of &quot;King of Fools.&quot;  This album makes albums by other metal bands seem horrible in comparison.

B00013AXEE|5.0|I read this book - my first by Stephen King - after noticing a lot of favorable reviews, and I really liked it. This book has been highly recommended in many different forums for young, aspiring writers, and I can see the reason why.<br />While the first half of the book is autobiographical, dealing with events that made Stephen King the type of writer he is; the second half deals almost exclusively with King's insights and suggestions on the craft of writing - from vocabulary, grammar, editing, etc., to the nuances of dialogue, description, and narration. Unlike many books dealing with the art of writing, this book has a friendlier, almost intimate approach, and King uses numerous examples from his own work and that of other writers to illustrate his points. Two of the best pieces of advice in this book are: \\"Write with your door closed, re-write with your door open\\", and \\"If you don't have the time to read, you don't have the time or the tools to write\\".<br />This is a very inspiring and motivating book for anyone interested in writing. King himself never stopped writing, no matter what the circumstances - the abject poverty of the early part of his life, or the excruciating pain as a result of the life threatening accident - and that is the biggest lesson in this book for writers.
B00008J4P5|5.0|2003 was the rock year for the White Stripes. They were the band, not Evanescence. The release of their \\"White Blood Cells\\" album had made Jack and Meg White rock idols for a generation and pushed them to the forefront of modern rock. So it was with the release of their latest album, \\"Elephant,\\" that they downplayed its release as much as possible. Typically, things didn't quite go their way...<br />Elephant was released in March 2003 amongst a wave of rave reviews and critical acclaim and grabbed the No.1 spot in the UK. The album was an international bestseller and sold millions worldwide bringing in a completely new fanbase. The distinctive White Stripes sound is ever-present here. They haven't tampered with what made they critically adored and that's the way it should be.<br />The now anthemic \\"Seven Nation Army\\" starts off the album in grand style, and was one of 2003's best songs. It was the song that sparked major interest from myself in this 'cool' band, because the bass is not only so damn catchy, but it just wedges itself into your brain until you'll be humming it for weeks on end. Don't even get me started on the video - nothing short of a masterpiece. \\"Black Math\\" opens with a manic bass that completely assaults your ears. Screaming vocals and a catchy beat make this song superb, along with the kind of lyrics that look ridiculous written on paper but then sound as cool as hell when heard. \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" is a song that people seem to dislike quite a lot, but I'm quite fond of it. A clear homage to Queen paves the way with a blaringingly blinding chorus and contrasting, subdued verses with the cruel, albeit amusing, lyrics, \\"I'd like to think that all this constant interaction is just the kind to make you drive yourself away. Each simple gesture done by me is counteracted and leaves me standing here with nothing else to say.\\" How cool is that? I think very!<br />\\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" was the second single from the album and had a hot video to counter it! Jack takes this Burt Bacharach composition and makes it completely retro. He means what he's singing, almost in a stalker-ish way. With \\"In The Cold, Cold Night,\\" Meg responds to this - yeah, she's saying you're a complete nut job, but she's gonna love you anyway. \\"I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart\\" sees Jack madly in love and willing to do anything to capture her attention, while \\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\" sees him display a very cute and inexperienced vocal technique, which stutters at the very end. \\"Ball And Biscuit\\" is the album's masterpiece at over seven minutes long. He redefines sex and rock and roll with this brilliant piece as he slurs lasciviously, \\"Let's have a ball and a biscuit sugar.\\"<br />\\"The Hardest Button To Button\\" starts off with a fantastic beat and some really brilliant lyrics. The beat continues all the way through and the chorus is just inspirational. And the video? You'll be seeing drum kits in your sleep! \\"Little Acorns\\" begins with a stereotypical American radio broadcaster (Mort Crim) talking about squirrels and a woman as a corny intro plays in the background. The song then starts with a brilliant beat and some [poor] lyrics, \\"Take all your problems and rip 'em apart.\\" Fantastic track. \\"Hypnotize\\" starts off very much like Black Math with a raging mass of sound and some screechy vocals. Jack wants to hypnotize us, baby, on the telephone. Sounds dumb. It isn't. He sings with confidence, yet with a sense of apprehension, \\"I want to hold your little hand, if I can be so bold.\\"<br />It doesn't even last two minutes before the next track, \\"The Air Near My Fingers,\\" comes blaring in. The lyrics are genius and I love his attitude on this track. The beat sways and his voice is particularly interesting. My favourite line is, \\"Don't you remember? You told me in December that a boy is not a man until he makes a stand. Well, I'm not a genius but maybe you'll remember this, I never said I everwanted to be a man!\\" Up next is \\"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine,\\" one of my favourites on the album. The beat is storming and I love Jack's screechy vocals. The chorus is totally catchy in its glorious splendour. I love the verses, where the beat stops and he sings with such gusto things like, \\"Well strip the bark right off a tree and just hand it this way. Don't even need a drink of water to make the headache go away. Give me a sugar pill and watch me just rattle down the street.\\" Love it man! The album closes with \\"Well It's True That We Love One Another,\\" a fantastic and very funny vocal threesome between brother, sister and Miss Holly Golightly. The song has such a British 60's feel and is a perfect way to end the album.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />I don't want to sound like one of those cling-ons that goes along with whatever is going down a storm and considered cool at the time, but if something's causing the feathers to ruffle amongst music industry critics, why not investigate? This is what I did with the White Stripes, and there's no denying that Elephant is a masterpiece of gargantuan proportions. At first I wasn't so sure, but you have to take a deeper listen and put yourself back in time about forty years to experience this in its glory. The bold statement at the back on the inlay \\"No computers were used during the writing, recording, mixing or mastering of this record\\" is a testament to this. I look forward to see what the White Stripes have to offer in future. Give this a go, it's worth it in the end.r wanted to be a man!\\" Up next is \\"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine,\\" one of my favourites on the album.

B00003CXXP|5.0|From what I've seen, people have a love-hate relationship with this movie.  Some people hate it and say it was the biggest waste of time they ever sat through.  Others say it was almost a spiritual experience.  I am among those who absolutely loved the movie.  I almost say it was the best movie I've ever seen.  The pure emotional and spiritual power behind the movie, culminating in the unbeleiveable ending left me in tears, and I'm a dude.  I don't cry at movies.  But I didn't cry because it was sad - I cried because the movie moves you in a way you don't yet understand.  I recomend this movie to anyone and everyone.
B000002H33|5.0|This is THE best Metal album in existence without question. It is one of those extremely rare albums where everysong is totally kick-ass. From the Raunchy yet artfully distorted Orion to the violent screaming and unmatchible guitar solos of the title track, there is no better album of its kind. YOu don't buy 2 good songs and the rest is filler like with most CDs. Totally worth $14.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I am very pleased with this movie,  I own it on vhs and was not disappointed with the picture quality on dvd.  This is the complete 6 hr miniseries, (minus the networks commercials that made it 8 hours).  The bonuses are great!
B00005YU1O|5.0|This film is so incredible that I can barely believe that it even exists. If you are sick of the predictable, crappy pap that theatres are full of, buy 10 copies of this movie, because you will want to give a copy to all of your friends.<br />However if you are the type of person who can't keep your eyes off of the soap operas, If you don't know the meaning of words like fecund or psychical or if you have every episode of the Dukes of Hazard on tape, then this is probably not the film for you.
B00012QM8G|1.0|I've gone through two DVD's already of the 2 sided release of this movie and both DVD's start skipping around chapter 15.  Don't buy this DVD until they come out with a fixed release.
B000002KIK|1.0|I am sort of going through a revision of BS albums, that I had on tapes and/or vynil long time ago. This one is not among my favorites. There is just too much Ozzy here, and not enough of everybody else. The title track is unremarkable; then the music goes up a bit on tracks 2 and 3, but then it slows down, and until the last track the sound is as boring as if it's Greatful Dead or something. The only thing that's cool about this album is its cover. I am at complete loss, why in most shops this CD is sold for higher price than other BS stuff.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This is the kind of movie that Hollywood feels compelled to go all fuzzy over to prove it can still make adult films. Yet the more serious this film takes itself, the more adolescent it becomes. If I had to sit through one more shot of the female lead, Scarlett Johansson, gazing wistfully out of a window - or one more shot meant to demonstrate a character's feeling of ennui at being in a foreign culture - I was in real danger of barfing on my shoes. These are the kind of moments that really fill the young with melancholy, but when you get a little older, the emotional power of these kinds of long, obvious shots sort of loose their whoomp. <br />I was frankly bored to tears, but I imagine I would have felt different about it at twenty or even thirty. I'm pushing fifty now, and a story filled with the emotional angst of a spoiled, bright girl holds as much interest as a flat Coke. <br />Bill Murray, however, is what makes the picture worth the effort not to fall asleep. He is, as he always is, a mesmerizing comic actor. His portrayal of an aging, nearing burned-out actor had some real strength to it.<br />But, all in all, it was not enough. This is a film made by a young person in love with her own sadness and imagined depth. In the adult world, real melancholy and dissatisfaction with life is not romantic and attractive. It is, instead, scary and hurtful and not something that would look nearly this pretty on the screen. -- Mykal Banta
B0000AXE8I|1.0|The question is how bad is the Matrix Reloaded?  Some where in the world, children are crying out in pain and anguish.  In another corner, a religious sect has been formed with the intent of never speaking the word 'Wachowski' again.  Because of this movie, world peace cannot be accomplished and the movie industry has been set back ten years.  If the Wachowski brothers had stopped after the first one, the world would be a better place. This movie is so incredibly shallow.  There are a few primary reasons for this.  Firstly, in this movie the action is primary to the plot as opposed to the first Matrix where the action was secondary.  The action IS the plot in this one.  The first movie smoothly integrated each action scene into the plot.  Secondly, Keanu talks too much.  One of the reasons for the great success of the first movie was the lack of dialogue for Keanu.  Anything more than 'Ok' or 'Because I belive' and the whole thing just comes off as cheesee.  The supposedly 'heavy' dialogue is all just BS.  It doesn't make any sense.  In one scene, a mysterious character even admits that what he will say will not make any sense, but not to worry.  Of course, he goes onto say it anyway.  I challenge someone to submit an actual transcript of the dialogue to an English teacher.  The teacher will instantly die of cardiac arrest.  &quot;Gah! Too... many... sentance... fragments!&quot;  Well it could have been worse.  Will Smith was originally asked to play the part of Neo (no joke).
B00000JLWW|1.0|This movie is horrible. That's right, horrible. ... The movie hardly describes the event correctly, and it does not honor the hundreds who died that night. All it focuses on is sexual relationships between a criminal and a woman who would be a criminal if it weren't for the fact she came from an upper-class family. And let's not forget the adultery it potrays. There's only tradgedy, and it's not the one it should be: crimal dies, adulterer cries. Horrible movie. What a waste of money.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I was lost in a vortex searching for new music to listen to.... in a world where untalented sugary pop stars dominate our society this CD is INCREDIBLE.

B0000024JA|5.0|This is the type au album where u can just sit and listen. Nufin else just sit and listen. well all you really need to listen to this album is about an 1/8. Its trippy mad noises with fat pumpin beats along with the genius raps of mef himself make this one of the best if not the best album to blaze up a fatty (or 6) to.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This show had a remarkable season.All 21 eps are great. The characters of Rory( Alexis Bledel) and Lorali (Lauren Gram) share a great dynamic. They bring you into there lives and make it impossible not to love them and impossible not to stay glued to you tv awaiting what will happen next. I love GG! And I have watched it from the very beginning. I cannot wait for the second and third season to be released also.
B00006690G|1.0|After hearing all the hype about this album, I had to experience it for myself. Why are people so obsessed about a guy that sings so fast no one can understand him? People actually think he can sing? He can't! I'd rather listen to fingernails against the blackboard instead of listening him &quot;trying&quot; to sing. <br />In his song &quot;without Me,&quot; why dis a bunch of people he doesn't like? Does he have to be that childish to toilet talk them in a song? Please, who ever thinks this is music, seriously needs to have their head examined.
B000007S5B|4.0|The Doors came bolting out of the gates with two LPs in 1967.  Waiting for the Sun appeared in mid-68, and it's clear there were already some problems with the band.<br />The album is very disjointed, and indeed it's known that this was supposed to include the full Celebration of the Lizard.  Instead, only one track survives--Not To Touch The Earth, which is excellent but is surrounded here by the happy go lucky tracks Love Street and Summer's Almost Gone.  The former is an ode to Patricia Morrison and is completely pleasant.  The latter is actually a holdover from their demo days.  It should have been on an earlier album.<br />Hello, I Love You is one of their poppiest tunes, and the riff is of course recognizable from the Kinks.  Spanish Caravan and The Unknown Soldier are known hits and are actually pretty dark.  This album ushers in the Moog full force, with a big, fat, warm fuzz sound.  Five to One is another track full of menace, another live favorite.<br />My Wild Love is different, no instruments, just voice and hand clapping.  But it reeks of improvisation in the face of ill preparation.  And indeed, the song Waiting for the Sun would not even appear on this album, but would wait until Morrison Hotel two years later.<br />The songs are good, but the album as a whole is not cohesive and is all over the place.  They probably should have waited to make the album they wanted to make.  But back in the old days, you were releasing an album a year, though with the vinyl LP you only had to supply around 30-40 minutes of music as opposed to CD capacity.<br />This is recommended for Doors fans, as are all six of their albums.  If you're interested in The Doors, it's best to skip the fifteen or so Greatest Hits or Best ofs or whatever shameless repackaging they come up with next for the same material.  Invest in the albums and you'll always find other gems and gain a better appreciation of the band.
0553278223|5.0|Regardless of what other reviewers have written, I believe this book to be a haunting work of art. Bradbury manages, through dozens of short vignettes, to tell the story of how mankind came to inhabit the Martian landscape. The idea that Bradbury imparted his own social agenda on this book is claptrap: He wrote with the beauty and elegance that is exclusive to him, and wove together a story from many different threads. He tells of the first voyages to Mars - and their subsequent failures - to the extinction of the Martian people.<br />While the book's premise - and even summary - comes across as nothing more than formulaic science fiction, Bradbury manages to stretch it to much more than that. This book is evenly paced and well-written. It is imperative that one recognises that this book is meant to transcend the circumstance at hand: Bradbury arguably wrote this book to represent the tie that mankind to Earth, rather than to just express the ventures of humanity to the stars.<br />Contrary to what many reviewers seem to have said, I don't see this book as being misanthropic or critical of humanity. Rather, it seems that Bradbury portrays humanity positively: He shows that mankind is always striving for something more, to go farther, to be better, faster, stronger, and more attune to their surroundings. And, he also shows how no matter things may change for mankind, we have a primative, yearning nature to return to the place that bore us: The Earth.<br />Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite books of all-time. I still find it to be crafted in a way which rings true of the Golden age of science fiction: It doesn't get bogged down in misanthropy or cynicism. Rather, it finds the silver lining - a sort of resounding feeling of hope eminates from this book. Wholeheartedly, I applaud not only the story, but Bradbury's magnificant ability to tell a story, an ability which seems to have been lost in most contemporary writing.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|After seeing Lost in Translation, my previous opinion that Bill Murray is the funniest man alive was supported.  He has been in some of my favorite movies...including this one.
B000060P79|4.0|People are reading way too much into the lyrics and stuff as far as this CD goes.  The bottom line is that this is a good album.  This is not because it symbolizes how I feel as a teen, but because it is just plain fun to listen to.  The first song is very catchy, and the rest of the CD makes you want to sing along.  It doesn't matter if it is \\"real punk\\" or not, it's just something to play when you hang around with friends.  I am tired of people knocking this album when it is better than a lot of crap out there.  <br />The fact remains that the majority of the people who listen to this CD are teenagers, and they really don't give a crap what punk was like back in the beginning, when people were actually finding meaning in the songs.  Most of these kids have never even heard of The Sex Pistols or The Clash, but you know what?  They are comfortable with that.  So don't waste your time trying to convince teens that this music is crap and they are stupid for listening to it.    <br />My point is that you shouldn't insult people just because they have different perspectives on music.  Everyone has different tastes, and we should be able to accept that.  It doesn't matter if you are looking for meaning in a song (which I respect, don't get me wrong) or if you are just trying to rock out.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Really solid performance - especially if you consider the fact that these guys are really old.  I mean, I'm 35 and was listening to them in their prime back when I was 14.  I don't expect them to sound exactly like they did back then, and wouldn't like it if they did.  Nice work.
B000001FTD|5.0|Now this is the album that comes to my mind when i think of speed-metal or thrash. Most people will probably think of Metallica, Slayer or Megadeth, though this is truly the closest any record has ever gotten to Thrash. ITS THAT FAST!!! Oh, and not only are they fast but they are also quite creative just listen to the beggining of the title track &quot;Among The Living&quot; or better yet listen to the drums at the beginning of &quot;Caught In A Mosh. Believe the hype, not only is this the best Anthrax ever got, its also truly one of my favourite Thrash albums next to Machine Heads &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot; and Fear Factory's &quot;Demanufacture&quot;. The only downside i have about this album is probably just the vocalist, like those shouty chorus's, though the stunning solo's and the side splitting humor in some of the songs make up for that. I recomenmd this album to those who don't mind singing in thrash, those who felt 80's thrash was all the same and especially to those who like fast and i mean FAST!!!!! music. Hope this helped
B0000C1733|1.0|This is a joke of an albulm to be called \\"Greatest Hits\\" because every single albulm in its entirety is greater than this cd up to Blood Sugar Sex Magik.

I for one do not like this sad Coldplay influenced, boring formula new bands seem to be going for these days .... these guys used to define \\"funk\\" but have lost there intensity.

B00005YUPO|2.0|This one bores my son (4 mos.), which is no mean feat considering a lightbulb can occupy his attention for half an hour.   Maybe these folks can come up with a Baby Lightbulb series; it would take as much craft as the video in question, which is mostly static camera shots of toys and home-video-esque \\"ain't she a darling?\\" shots of the filmmakers' kids.
0152438203|3.0|This is just a note to say beware of the new translation if you've previously read and enjoyed the Katherine Woods version.  Mr. Howard makes the argument in his \\"translator's note\\" that the language has changed since the 1940's and that a new translation is needed.  I couldn't disagree more.  And I [do] speak with some experience on this subject:  I read this title at school in the original French language for three different classes, as well as numerous times in English (the Woods version).  Katherine Woods beautifully captured the feel of the French original.  The new, Howard translation is in a more modern English which mostly succeeds at removing the poetry that previously existed and little else that I can find.  It does not make the story any more clear or nuanced than it previously was, rather less so.  I find the arguments for a new translation indefencible.<br />Three stars is not a review of the book, but of the translation.  This title is beyond excellent, but you might do yourself a favor and find a used copy with the Woods translation (there are many copies out there).  Enjoy!
B00008CLOA|5.0|Thanks to my dad I've always liked Pink Floyd growing up, but I've never payed attention until now.  This disc alone inspired me to revamp my HT system to support it's awesome sound.  The clarity and richness of each channel deserves more than the standard theatre-in-a-box solution.  Guthrie did an amazing job crafting a premier example of the power of multichannel SACD.  I would suggest everyone who hasn't heard this updated masterpiece to venture on down to their local Hi-Fi retailer for a listen.  I have no doubt you'll be hooked.
B000002UB3|5.0|Fact - The Beatles are the Greatest band ever, Fact - this is their best album ever.  Also, I am very biased as this is the very first LP I ever owned, got it for Christmas in 1969 from my parents when we got our first record player.  By the time the Beatles made this album they were at their absolute peak of musicianship, the sound quality was the best of any of their albums and Abbey Road gets back to feelings of their first albums but with far more creativity than ever before.  I love the difference in the two sides (thinking in terms of when it was an vinyl LP), with fully developed songs first and then some of the most memorable short tunes all run together and blended so beautifully.  Like a fireworks displays the Beatles ended that part of their lives with the greatest display ever and the best of all four.  A must have album.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I used to live in South Carolina...and there was a college radio station that played alternative country music on Sunday afternoons.  I first heard Wilco on that station (90.5...one of the best stations in America).  I went and bought Wilco and have never regretted it!  Wilco's music &quot;comes from the heart&quot;.  I feel that alternative country does not get the attention it needs, especially Wilco!  This album is a perfect example of what many people in America are missing!
0385504209|1.0|A &quot;cut and paste&quot; replay of the author's &quot;Angels and Demons&quot;. Badly written, not a trace of humour, stuffed with boring non-information. I stopped reading when I reached 2/3 of the book. What is the sense of this all? I have still no idea.<br />People who dare to compare this inane scribbling with e.g. Umberto Eco's work should be flogged on the spot.<br />Incomprehensible that these nonsense should be on top of  bestseller lists, which proves the craziness of the booksellers world.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is way better than the theatrical version of 'The Two Towers' the characters are more fleshed out, there is more action and most importantly more Gollum. This is the best DVD I have I was disappointed by the extended 'Fellowship of the Ring' I thought it dragged on way too long. With this one I wasn't bored for a second. A must buy for everyone.
0312955006|1.0|I'm sorry to go against the average opinion on this book but I found it extremely boring, at least till page 200 or so! Everytime I'd open it and try to read it I got sleepy eyes.<BR>What's up with all the street names of LA?? Who cares about every single street every single carachter takes on his way to anywhere??<BR>Unless you're from LA this becomes utterly boring! Delete all the references to streets, avenues, boulevards and whathaveyou and you will end up with a 20 pages book even a child could write.<BR>Very repetitive (too much so) descriptions and thoughts and quite predictable.<BR>Again, if so many people consider this book to be the best among those Connelly has written thus far I can say this is my first and LAST.
0452282152|4.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring is a wonderful and pleasant read. Not too challenging or thought-provoking, but an imaginative story that I think most people will enjoy. Tracy Chevalier has come up with an interesting concept. She takes an enigmatic Vermeer painting -- The Girl with a Pearl Earring -- and weaves an interesting and well-written story about it. Griet is a young woman whose family's financial luck has changed after an accident leaves her artisan father blind. She is hired as a teenage girl to work in Johannes Vermeer's household as a maid. But her own artistic gifts and sensibilities get the artist's attention. Griet soon begins to secretly assist him with his work. Griet ultimately models for the painter, and doing so creates conflict in her life...<br /><br />I found this an interesting read, perfect for a lukewarm spring day when you are searching for something substantial to read. I had a difficult time getting into this novel at first, but I soon warmed up to it. I love the historical references and Chevalier's lyrical writing style. I hope the film version has done this wonderful novel justice. I recommend The Girl with the Pearl Earring.
0060930187|5.0|Annotation:   The Bell Jar details the life of Esther Greenwood, who is very successful, intelligent, and beautiful. For no explained reason, Esther begins to go crazy. Sylvia Plath takes you into Esther's mind, and you slowly fall into her insanity right along with her. You will experience a cynical yet reasonable outlook on life.<br />Author Bio:   Sylvia Plath was born in 1932. She was raised in a middle-class home, and attended Smith College. During her junior year in college, she suffered a mental breakdown. This is chronicled in The Bell Jar, which is largely autobiographical. She recovered well enough to finish her senior year, receiving various awards and graduating summa cum laude. She won a Fulbright scholarship and went to Cambridge University for two years. There, she met Ted Hughes, a British poet whom she married and moved to England with. With him, she had two children. She committed suicide at age 30, and her macabre poetry was collected afterwards in three books.<br />Evaluation:   The reason I bought this book was because the name sounded familiar, and the back told me that I would be following the crack-up of Esther Greenwood. It sounded interesting, but little did I know just how closely I would witness Esther's insanity! What really stands out in my mind about The Bell Jar is how immersed I was in Esther's world, thoughts, and feelings. I felt like I was right there with her, and I could almost feel her emotions. At many points, I had to stop reading because I was beginning to feel as depressed as she was! Sylvia Plath does an excellent job of bringing the reader into Esther's mind. Her cynical views seemed very normal and feasible. Ideas and phrases are well articulated, so you can understand exactly what Sylvia/Esther is talking about. Plath's thoughts are very well expressed. It's incredibly interesting to read about somebody who is going insane, especially since the story is largely autobiographical - so you know that Esther's outlook on life and her downward spiral were actually experienced by Sylvia Plath. I love how nothing in the book is sugarcoated. It's great to read something that has the ability to take you from your normal, healthy mind into the psychology of someone going crazy. Finally, I loved the metaphor about the bell jar, from which the book got its title. So while the story can be depressing and a bit much at times, it's very well worth it in the end. To sum it up, this book is extremely interesting, realistic, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read that's a little bit out of the ordinary.
0385510438|5.0|This is not your typical Grisham novel. No powerful villains stalk these pages, and no tangled legal conspiracy reveals itself at the end. Instead unfolds a chronicle of life in a small Mississippi town as seen from the perspective of a once  aimless twenty three year named Will Traynor. In the first pages, young Will borrows a little money from his Memphis aunt so he can buy and become the editor of a dying weekly paper, The Ford County Times. His new job leads him into a long and wondeful friendship with the book's title character. She's Calia Ruffin, an insightful, religious black matron who's raised a very unusual crop of kids. For Will it's the beginning of his long overdue &quot;coming of age&quot;. This tale is filled with quirky characters and colorful anecdotes that felt authentic. I kept wanting to tell myself that this kind of material couldn't be made up. No, this novel does not meander. Yes, there is a murder trial and a secret. Would it be a Grisham novel without both? But here, the answers lie not in some insidious plot but instead in characters and flaws of ordinary people. Grisham applies his usual narrative skill but adds the self-deprecating humor I witnessed a one of his lunch speaches. I strongly recomend this novel.
B00008PW2D|1.0|I pretty like the whole series. I own all the previous seasons, but I will be very reluctant to buy the 5th seacon just because of the unreasonable high price. HBO charges $49.99 for only 2-disc. Is it greedy? I even heard that HBO will split the 6th season into two parts. So we need to pay $100 for only one season. Is HBO too smart?
B0000C8AQM|5.0|I was asking about a song, but I figured out it was &quot;The Wait&quot; by Metallica.  This is an awesome song and it should have been on the soundtrack!
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm not big on alternative rock (don't think I'm a pop or hip hop follower though--I'm a classic rocker, thank you very much), so my view on Evanescence shouldn't matter to some. Hopefully someone will read this that doesn't listen to a lot of this kind of stuff. But I CAN tell this album was definatley made with some refreshing emotion behind it, not acts that seem to plague a lot of music lately. Okay, maybe the whole goth angle is kind of forced, but hey at least its not overkill, nor does it seem like goth-light or anything. Actually its rather refreshing to me too. See, there is pop-ish copying of styles, and theres blend styles to make an artist's signature, unique sound. THAT'S how I would describe Evanescence. They aren't copying goth just to be cool, it is a part of their sound, albiet not the ONLY part. Maybe its just because I seem to have a taste for liking groups that are hard to classify, but I'm like their stuff quite a bit. Just because other less mainstream groups have more morbid lyrics doesn't always make it better. The goth factor is actually quite balanced in my opinoin. Yes, the lyrics are pretty basic, to put it nicely, in a few spots and the record doesn't have enough variation--enough so that its not numbing, just moderately disappointing. I've heard some say they're LB ripoffs, and others music snobs say \\"yeah right!\\" To me, a layman: perhaps somewhat, but they're not ripoffs, no. And you've going to sound like SOMEONE anyways (you should respect your peers and elders, right?). But then we can nickpic anything and make it much less than it should be. Anyway, back to the album. There's a handfull of great songs, the rest are above average (my estimation of them is increasing all the time), and of course the pretty \\"My Immortal\\" which you've almost bound to have heard by now, even if you hate MTV. To any who are a bit caution of buying something to dark for their taste and are somewhat put off by other reviews of describe it as a \\"downer,\\" I'll just say that I don't care much for real dark stuff, but this isn't even coming close to my limits. It's quite enjoyable actually.<BR>Geez nobody's going to read this wordy review, better finish it up...So if you are still wondering whether to see what's behind the hype, I'd give it a thumbs up. Not life changing by any strech, but pretty good. I hope they won't be one more group that can't get out of their premier's shadow and die trying, but for now lets hope they're just warming up... 'cause it seems I'm getting close to becoming a fan. Yeah, this CD got much better with repeat listenings for me.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Okay Maynard, we get.  Some record company/exec has done you wrong.  But do we have to hear about in every record?  Resolve the situation already and stop writing songs about it.  Like &quot;The Package&quot;.<br />The music in this new CD shows promise but is lacking any real appeal.  The previous 'A Perfect Circle' CD showed much more promise with songs like &quot;Judith&quot; and &quot;3 Libras&quot;, although the latter smacked of the resentment that I spoke of earlier.  Still, its an excellent song.<br />Nearly every song on 'Mer de Nom' is a winner, yet 'Thirteenth Step' seems to lack any passion or dare I say effort.<br />I know it's very difficult to create as you do, so I wish you much success on your next CD.<br />It tears my heart out to be so critical of this band because I loved the last CD as well as nearly everything by the band &quot;TOOL&quot; !!!<br />I own every-single-thing that &quot;TOOL&quot; has on the market and I hope that there will be a new one soon!<br />Best of luck guys...
B00005JM1F|3.0|From what I've read in reviews and stuff, and from the press, I was so thinking that I was going to be offended by this film, or some such other utter nonsense. That's why I thought it would be good to review - so I could give a really bitchy long review, and go on about how it's a total guy films, cos all the chicks get their kit off, and none of the guys do.<br />After being warned by the person watching it with me, that I was going to be offended, I couldn't see how I was supposed to be. I was expecting right from the start to be a sort of American Pie etc film - lots of nudity, crude jokes etc. It wasn't. There are a few funny bits, but they're few &amp; far between - I think there's something wrong me, I don't laugh at films/TV anymore, unless it's the little bird in Looney Tunes: Back In Action! The nudity is also hardly there - a guy running through the streets naked, and two girls, who take off their tops, and 'surprise' an old guy. (You can see that bit coming!)<br />Otherwise, I was quite disappointed with this movie. I was wanting to write a really long review and really complain about this film, but unfortunately, I can't. I will say one thing, it's not that much of a guy movie it's made out to be.
B000084T18|1.0|50 cent is the biggest joke in the rap business these days. I could rap too if I made up my own words, and &quot;would you hug me if I smelled?&quot;, or &quot;You're a wanksta betchu aint even got none&quot; are just a couple of examples of his horrible rhyme making,AND THOSE ARE HIS SINGLES!!! I thought Eminem was bad when he came out, but at least he can rhyme without making up words. Please, for the love of god, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ALBUM!!!!!
B00018D44U|1.0|Since most people reading these reviews aren't shopping for elevator music, I can't recommend this.  &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; makes Norah Jones' debut CD (which I was disappointed with beyond words) sound energetic.  Hoping to hear vast improvement, I purchased this and basically saw the opposite.  Never in my life have I heard anything so boring, and I listen to incredibly quiet and slow music.  There is no soul whatsoever anywhere on this CD.  The performances are as lackluster as possible.  Norah Jones is a mediocre singer with no personality.  I just can't, for the life of me, figure out how this is so popular.  It's truly sad that she's selling so many CDs when there are extremely talented musicians working two dayjobs to make ends meet.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|Jeff Shannon above gave a bad editorial review, but I think this movie was great. But, then, not everyone can like a movie.<BR>The settings, and actor performances are amazing. <BR>Jeff was right about one thing. It is obvious who the killer is from the start, but the movie is not about the obvious. Who is to say that there is only one killer, and who is to say that those people we consider to be crazy are actually crazy. Maybe they see a little further than \\"normal\\" people can.<BR>Give it a try.
0060528737|5.0|If you haven't read these books, start right now. Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen are three of the most amazing books I have ever read. They are set in a world so much like our own, but yet so different and will have you entranced all the way through.<br />I hope that maybe Garth Nix will start a new trilogy that is set in the same world as these three, so I can read more of the Abhorsen stories, or perhaps, stories from the Clayr or royal family.
B000002U82|5.0|All the songs on this CD are excellent. The ones that I really enjoy are &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;. These two have such amazing beats and incredible sound effects. In &quot;Time&quot;, there are clocks donging in the beginning, which really set up the song as a great one. In &quot;Money&quot;, there are cash register sound running throughout the whole song, which really had a magnificent effect on the greatness of the song. My other favorite song on this album is &quot;Brain Damage&quot;. I'm surprised this did not make it to the Echoes CD. &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot; does not have any words in it. But man, does it have a cool beat!<br />This CD drew me into my little musical world the moment I popped it into my CD player. If you're new to Pink Floyd, this is a great place to start with their music.
B00006L7XQ|3.0|I read some reviews and I think people are over-rating this one. It's got some very good performances on it, especially the title track, but the album as a whole didn't win me over.<BR>But on the other hand all credit to someone who can re-record an old chestnut like 'The first time I ever saw your face' and make it worth listening to! And it is worthwhile getting hold of the album just to hear the timbre of Cash's voice.

0553212621|3.0|Published in 1928, Lady Chatterley's Lover was D. H. Lawrence's last novel--it was also his most daring and blatantly erotic work. Even by today's standards, it's erotica, or &quot;erotic romance.&quot; Like two of his previous novels, it was banned on publication, a ban which lasted until 1960. But an uncensored edition of the book was privately printed in Italy and copies were smuggled all over Europe and America. <br />The storyline is quite simple--a bored wife out in the country married to a rich, feeble, annoying husband in a wheelchair falls in love (and lust) with the robust and exciting gamekeeper employed by her husband. Sooner or later things are bound to go wrong, and this can't end happily.<br />This isn't Lawrence's best-written novel, but it is his most groundbreaking work, as it created decades of discussion and debate about what could/should and couldn't/shouldn't be published. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of Love and Madness
B0001Q4CXE|5.0|This documentary is the latest in a series of works that seek to lay bare the mind of LBJ's Secretary of Defense, architect of the Vietnam War. Virtually the entire film is a closeup of McNamara staring into the camera and talking...expurgating his innermost thoughts and emotions about not only his role in executing the Vietnam War, but also the demons he harbors as a result of his part in the burning to death of thousands of Japanes civilians during World War II bombing raids. (He goes so far as to volunteer that, had the Allies lost the war, he, LeMay and others would have been tried as war criminals.) Because the camera lense is mounted on the monitor into which McNamara is looking at his interviewer, his gaze points straight ahead at us, creating an intensely personal experience. His eyes and expression reveal as much as his words. That is to say, volumns.<br />This film is a must-see for anyone seeking to better his or her understanding of the Vietnam era. It is also an intimate look inside the psyche of a haunted and guilt-wracked man, a man whom God has seen fit to sentence to a long life contemplating his actions from so many years ago.
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah Jones' latest is quite a departure from her debut album.  The expressive piano is still here as is the soft and smokey voice, but many of the tunes are more playful and complex.  It's an interesting change of direction - and portends well for her continued growth.<br />Why 4 stars?  She's young and still developing her artistic voice. I'll reserve the 5th star (and judgement) for her next effort. <br />By the way, to the reviewer who slammed Ms Jones and recommended Kylie Minouge . . . Well, I guess if 15 year old techno-pop melodies, simple lyrics (Come on and dance with me, yeah, slow. . .) and a voice reminiscent of a mature Brittany Spears is your thing, go for it!

B000092Q4U|5.0|I seen them at the metal&amp;hardcore fest--which was pretty amazing... I own new american gospel &amp; i also thought that it self an amazing album! Im ussualy turn on by much more as i said in the hatebreed review i quess  more insane &amp; crazy music then with gore lirycs but i mean i love  real metal &amp; lamb of god plays nothing the purest form of metal you can find! Tho, difirent from their debut n.a.g.  &quot;as the palace burns&quot; still souunds pretty brutal &amp; it has an excellent production---overall its worth the try! If you into extreme metal  buy it! Keep real metal alive!!!
B00009V7P8|4.0|this cd came very highly recommended by the raving reviews from a respected friend/critic.  i was extremely disappointed at first.  the cd seemed slow and uninventive in terms of melody.  i gave it about four more half-a** listens.  nothing happened.  I finally sat down with nothing else to do and cranked up the volume.  with focused attention, i finally caught the nuances of his songs and THEN (ONLY then) did the cd start to grow on me.  now it doesn't leave my cd player.  for me, this is not the traditionally catchy love-at-first listen deal.  Definitely worth giving it a try though.
B00008J4P5|5.0|after finding the white stripes and listening to all three of their albums at the time they auickly became one of my fav bands of all time.  At the time white blood cells was my fav, but when elephant came out i loved it just as much if not more.  de stijl is awesome too, their debut album isnt so hot in my opinion.<br />...my fav tracks...<br />1.seven nation army- totally played out but for a good reason.<br />3.no home for you here- awesome. long section of jack getting sick on his guitar, all the diff vocal effects r tight also, Queen inspired n u can hear it.<br />4.i just dont know what to...- starts of softer, then gets hard and sick.  when it gets hard they almost sound like a diff band for a moment, but quickly throw in some screechin vocals and some halting guitar and drums.<br />7.you've got her in your pocket- softer and slower. the lyrics really click with me as they always do.  they continue to find new and creative melodies for their lyrics and vocals.<br />9. the hardest button to button- sounds like classic rock from start to finish. from the opening bass and riff, to the concluding chanting of &quot;the hardest button to button&quot; built up and set off by megs drums. awesome.<br />12.the air near my fingers- awesome lyrics sick guitar and drums, add piano for tight chorus.<br />14.its true that we love one another- awesome, creative melody, playful lyrics.  as with white blood cells, an awesome concluding track.<br />starts with a bang, and ends as such. another classic by a band i now consider to be epic.  im hard pressed to think of another rock band responsible for so many tracks in my daily listening.  their minimal, raw, creative power should impress most educated listeners.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've been listening to DT on and off for the past several years starting with &quot;Images And Words&quot; back in '92. Since then, I've gravitated more towards the heavier side of metal. DT has always dabbled in this, but never to the degree that this album has.<br />They've somehow managed to take the best of what's driving metal today and infused it with their own signature sound creating a modern day metal classic.<br />For those unfamiliar (or unimpressed) with Dream Theatre, imagine Megadeth's &quot;Rust In Peace&quot; in a head on collision with Alice In Chains &quot;Dirt&quot;.<br />If you're a metalhead that's heard about DT, THIS is the album to get.<br />Absolutely pummeling.
0743455967|5.0|I was really impressed by the insight into the writing process that Stephen King shares in this book. The book is fairly evenly split into two parts. The first half of the book is mostly autobiographical but very inspiring as you learn from King's own struggle to gain success as a writer and how he paid the bills in the interim.<br />Before the remainder of the book begins, there is a thirty-page section called \\"Toolbox\\" in which King discusses the must-have tools you'll need like grammar, vocabulary, and others. It's here that King begins to relate his hatred for adverbs, something I found very interesting. \\"Adverbs, like the passive voice, seem to be created with the timid writer in mind... With adverbs, the writer usually tells us he or she is afraid he/she isn't expressing himself/herself clearly, that he or she is not getting or the picture across.\\"<br />The second half of the book is where King really gets into the \\"meat\\" of good writing skills. He talks about how important it is to read A LOT in order to be a good writer. (An appendix in the back has a listing of all the books King read while working on this one, a very long list.) He talks about the environment that you need when you sit down to write. Then he talks about core writing topics like similes and metaphors, dialogue (good and bad), theme, plot, revising your draft, and more.<br />I can easily say that I will definitely re-read parts of this book in the future in order to re-familiarize myself with King's insight. By my definition, that is the requirement of a \\"5 star\\" book ranking.<br />\\"Words create sentences; sentences create paragraphs; sometimes paragraphs quicken and begin to breathe.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched this series while it was briefly on television but heard some buzz about the DVD on the web so I bought it.  It is well-cast, well-written, adult-oriented, and compelling. I found it better than most anything I have seen on television.  My girlfriend, who hates science fiction, started watching the premire episode with me and was hooked as well.   You can tell that, for creator Joss Whedon, this was a labor of love.  I am simply amazed that Fox didn't even let the series complete its first season.   Rumor has it that Firefly has been green-lighted as a movie now as well so hopefully someone will pick it up and the series will fly again.  The promising, and chilling, story-arcs started in these 14 episodes need to be completed.   Great storytelling!
0385504209|2.0|This book is a hoot from start to finish. Having researched Opus Dei, the Knights Templar, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, and the facts known about Mary of Magdala, I thought it proposterous from start to finish, but very clever. I bought copies for friends so they could laugh at it. That anybody would ever take it seriously never occurred to me. To write something like this, you have to take egregious liberties with historical facts, and have utter disregard for the reputations of people living and dead. A laughable story. That it would be so widely successful never occurred to me. Dan Brown, enjoy it while it lasts. Any time an author scores like this, the rest of us have to be happy for you! You have pulled off an incredible joke on everybody! Anne Rice, 1239 First Street, New Orleans Louisiana, 70130
0385510438|1.0|I was disappointed with Grisham's latest book, The Last Juror.  The book slowly plodded along with no real direction.  Not much a story: 25-year-old Willie buys a small-town newspaper and writes about the townsfolk.  A man, Padgitt, kills and rapes a woman.  Man is not sentenced to death penalty because of a hung jury.  Newspaper sales go up.  Willie befriends an older black woman, writes about her family, has lunch with her every Thursday.  10 years later, Padgitt is released from jail.  Willie sells the newspaper.  Black woman dies of heart attack.  The end.  Come on!!!  This book was awful.<br />Like most readers, I read for fun.  This book was not fun.  What happened to the Grisham who wrote simple-minded, super-fast reads such as The Rainmaker, The Client and The Firm?
B0001AP12G|5.0|All I can say is that I love the cd. There are very few albums that I can listen to from beginning to end. This is one of them. Kanye's lyrics are actually talking about 'something'. Not just a bunch of booty shaking and profanity. Don't get me wrong, I'll jam a Ying Yang Twinz booty song in a minute, but I also like to hear songs that have substance and thats what I found on this album. It was different from all the other same songs you hear on the radio. This is a definite 'must-have'! Its worth the $$.
B00005JLXE|1.0|I can't write an completely spoiler free review, so be warned:<br />A *defense* lawyer, in the second scene in this film is prosecuting a rapist. Deciding that vigilante justice is needed, he kills the man for date raping a woman he doesn't know. Rough justice, but it's a movie, right? So why does his character refuse to kill the man who murdered *his own father*? Because, Afflect says, &quot;He's the hero.&quot;<br />Skip this movie. They don't get any worse.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Not much to say, it was a terrible movie,. I waited and waited  for something to happen. Like Bill Murrey had a stupid look on his face the whole movie, which might of meant, you dummy, you paid over 7 bucks to view this crap???? I think it made the Japanese look like nitwits.
B00013F35I|4.0|Even though I'm not into buying concert DVDs, I bought this because I've always wanted to see Springsteen in concert but never have. There are a lot of great moments on this, especially &quot;Empty Sky&quot;(about the world trade center disaster), the emotion he shows on that one song alone makes this DVD worth watching. A very somber moment in the show definitely. Another is the what I call the follow-the-leader moment in &quot;Ramrod&quot; where the band follows him marching along the front of the stage inches away from the fans. There's no doubt he loves to play for audiences around the world. It was also amusing to watch him forget the words to &quot;Spirit In The Night&quot; while on the piano and grinning and saying &quot;uno momento.&quot; The sound is not too good on some songs but I wouldn't let that stop me from buying this DVD.  Could've used more bonus features.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'd never heard of this show until I noticed the customer reviews while browsing through Amazon.com ... The response was so overwhelming that I HAD to check it out. It is without a doubt the best series I've ever seen. I was completely absorbed by the stories and characters, and watched the entire series in one sitting - I just couldn't stop. I hope another station picks up on this great show and carries it forward!! (and I can hardly wait to see the movie!!!)
B00003CXA3|3.0|This movie was good, but it wasn't THAT good.<br />The ending itself is a HUGE left-off-hanging disappointment.<br />It doesn't really stand out from a lot of other cop movies that received far less attention.
B00012QKSI|5.0|If you love the movie, you will love the CD! One of the movie's lifelines is the soundtrack, complementing the love stories. Beautiful renditions by Joni Mitchell, Eva Cassidy and Girls Around will make you dance, laugh, and cry. This CD gives the movie a more loving feeling. The CD is simply great!
B00000JR2A|2.0|Except for the Year of the knife, and Sowing the Seeds of Love, this album is at best mediocure. Extremely disappointing when considering how good Songs from the Big Chair is.
B00009V7RF|3.0|They were better off without Fergie. She just makes them more mainstream &amp; sucky, but oh well. She's a good singer (listen to any Wild Orchid CD...), so i can't complain. Anyway, this CD pretty good. It's nothing Grammy Worthy (except maybe Where is the Love...only because of its social message), but its fun. Fergie has a really strong voice, and she adds to the group for the most part, except when she's randomly ad-libbing &amp; making a good song suck. <br />* The best song on the CD is &quot;Hey Mama&quot; - the dance hall rhythym is great. But imagine my surprise when they BUTCHER the song on the video. It's a completely different song &amp; it sucks. The album version is way better. Everytime i hear it, i want to dance. It's a fun song.<br />* Other Highlights: &quot;Shut Up&quot; (my 2nd favorite) - Fergie really sounds good on this one, and &quot;Hands Up&quot;. <br />* Everything else is mediocre or worse - ESPECIALLY &quot;Anxiety&quot; &amp; &quot;Where is the love&quot;. Those 2 songs are WEAK. I think people got the wrong idea about BEP from listening to Where is the Love. It was a bad single to release.<br />This CD is definitely for middle &amp; high schoolers - it's not very complex, but if you're older - &amp; you just want to have fun, buy this album. It's fun.
B00008ADPF|5.0|As soon as I put in this new disc I knew they had changed their style up. Many reveiw writers don't seem to like when an artist or group changes their artistical veiws and styles. But Nickelback has grown in the past few years. Chad Kroeger's voice booms with a new confidence, and the lyrical style is more orginized. In previous albums the lyrics would jump from topic to topic, in just one song. I'm not one for band politics like some people here, I just love the music they produce. Others tend to judge a groups music on the group themself, so their opinions are completely biased on the people performing, instead of the music they play on this album.<br />So, forget what the band politics are just listen to this CD and I bet you'll love it. It's one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. My favourite song has to be 'Feelin' Too Damn Good'.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Although this series has been way too often advertised as simply a &quot;Western-SF&quot; it is so much more than that.<BR>It's honestly the best television I have seen in forever, it has such great writing, acting, effects (Emmy remeber) and just such a great overall feel to it, it's simply amazing. It's also very refreshing to see a &quot;sience fiction&quot;, wich doesn't revolve around sience and aliens and the like, but just about the people. This makes the series probably more a drama than anything else, only in a just so much more creative setting.<BR>Really even if you don't like SF at all, there is a very good chance that you'll get hooked only halveway trough the pilot.<br />The DVD set itself is very complete, 50% of all the episodes have commentaries (wich are very nice), and there are quite a few other intresting extra's (just Joss Whedon singing the (by the way briliant) theme song, and Adam Baldwin's verson of &quot;the Hero of Canton&quot; make this DVD set worth the purcase). <BR>And although there are only 14 episodes this set will over you ages of viewing pleasure, every episode deserves to be watch dozens of time, you'll be amazed at how many detals you keep discovering.<br />Thereare only two bad thing about this series:<BR>1 - It's way to short, this 'verse' coulda gone on for ever, and by the time you'll seen all the episodes, it leaves you very sad and angry that there aren't anymore (so you'll just continu to watch them over and over agian)<BR>2 - It will make (almost) every other television series look cheap, uninventive and boring.<br />Now you could go on and read all the other 700+ reviews, of wich 99.9% are positive or you could just order this set, and enjoy it, untill the movie is released (yup,for those of you who don't know yet, there'll be a movie about this series in 2005 called Serenity)
B0000AI44Q|5.0|This review is my response to a recent show of Neil's I attended in Camden, NJ. Everytime I spin this disc, it brings me back to sec. 102 row &quot;Y&quot; in the theatre and to Greendale, a very human place much like any in America; therefore my review of this CD is the same as the show. Although in addition, I will comment here on the sound quality/fidelity of the disc - very very good. Also, the CD does not contain explicit tracks down memory lane; I have those discs when the urge/need hit. Now, on to the review:<br />I can't tell you how taken I was with Neil's show last week. It was everything I ever wanted from the man live; short of an intimate solo acoustic show. For me, Greendale is a home run and brilliant. It is as I have read, simple yet powerful. All of the storytelling in-between songs and the less-than-Broadway (but very effective)theatrics are essential to the work as a whole. God bless him for ignoring the nay sayers and taking this more than worthy piece back on the road again. It was very clear, to me, in his playing that this work means a great deal to him.<br />He touched on so many themes within this piece of work called Greendale that have been mainstays of his sensibilities throughout his career. All of these themes were woven into nine or so songs so subtly that you had know idea of the full scope of this project as each song unfolded, then exploded - So reserved and subtley into an incredibly touching, soulful power that was as raw and beautiful as any human's soul. The elements of history - we all have one before we arrive. Our town, our people, our family, our community, our nation, the media, the government, the environment, personal responsibility, the power of action and love - I was blown away!<br />Then came the old favorites. I appreciated that he appeased the fans stuck in time, although I would have been just fine to forgo memory lane, I think it ultimately detracted from the brilliant current piece of work that was just laid downbefore us. Also, I was simply to tired and had heard those songs that way before - LOUD!<br />Greendale is an arrow from Neil's soul to your's, and one of the clearest windows into this man's creative mind. Thank you Neil.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|When I first learnt about MR, I didn't want to see it. I thought it was something else and I don't like durty movies. but then, when it came on DVD, I borrowed it and saw it. It was so amazing how my opinion can change for something. I was tottaly charmed by the songs, the talent the actors had, and the atmosphere of the film. It began with happiness, fun and laugh, but then, the part of the tragedy came... When you first see the begging, you think \\"It will be more fun than I thought\\". But when the tragedy comes, then you don't have to think anything cauze everything is on the screen. It is one of the greatest musicals ever, in my opinion. It will teach you lot's of things and some of them will stay in your heart for ever...If you really want to know the true meaning of the film, then you must not lose a sentence from it. Every word has a different meaning. <BR>I think even you don't like most of musicals, you might like this one. I don't like so much musicals and when I saw MR, I got obsessed with everything in it. It has something different for all the other films, something you will manage to find yourself. It is a sad romantic film and it can describe love. <BR>Another thing that touched me was the music. The words, the phrases...they all have something they hide. And of course the wonderful tango Roxanne, one of people's favourite scene...<BR>You must see it.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|Excellent CD, simply put. <br />As stated previously, it is not understood why there is such a galactic amount of hate for this album. Calling this album &quot;outstanding&quot; would even be an injustice. <BR>Dream Theater is different... and intriguing. Anyone who knows anything about music will not even attempt to deny that these musicians have some serious skill.<br />If you don't like this, you're in the wrong genre of music.<br />5 out of 5, and I would give more if I could.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I can't remember the last movie I could not actually finish before this one, but i turned it off after about 30 minutes.  I wasn't even vaguely interested in either of the main characters.  I hope Bill Murray returns to what he is good at; Good Movies.
B000000WGL|5.0|Keith Richards is musical down to the marrow of his splendid bones, and this album (as well as his next one, Main Offender) illustrates that backwards, forwards, sideways and upside down. <br />What that man gets out of a guitar (and vice versa) is legendary, of course, so I'm not going to struggle to find words for it - just hear and be blown away. How Keith takes that beautifully ragged instrument of a voice he's blessed with to show us the beauty of the melodies he's hearing is a marvel and a joy. <br />The X-Pensive Winos are another fine and valiant band for the master to rock with - may they all rock on and on.  The album's a gem, and Keith's a treasure.
B000000I02|5.0|I have to say after 30 years of listening,<BR>Hatfield and the North are still my band<BR>of choice. Maybe they will reband some day.

B0000AOV85|2.0|While this is a very interesting documentary I must admit that it wasn't what I was looking for.  Ever since the advent of DVD I've been hoping to replace my Dark Side VHS concert tape with a DVD version (as you might imagine, the VHS is worn out!).  I was so counting on this to be that DVD.  I agree with many others that this was a disappointing disc in that regard.  The sleeve really is cryptic and while it says &quot;An in-depth look at...&quot; I think we are all just conditioned now to believe these in-depth looks are extras, not the main course.  I'm sure I'll watch this again and I'll share it with some friends (so they don't fall victim as I did) but how hard would it have been (or be) to put the concert footage on along with the documentary?   I'm not sure how much longer my tape is going to last.  I'm growing sad.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|For those who are already deep into Dream Theater and for those who are welcome newcomers, I think, it is worth acknowledging that one among very typical lines of discussion and reflection regarding their work is the assesment of whether a certain album/period/song, etc is more &quot;progressive-leaning&quot; or &quot;metal-leaning&quot;. If we opt to resort to that framework the new &quot;Train of thought&quot; would have to be undoubtedly classified as the most &quot;metal-leaning&quot; DT album since &quot;Awake&quot;. However true that comment may be, there is, I think an ongoing &quot;complication&quot;: as Dream Theater evolves it looks as if it goes further in a very interesting process of synthesizing the best out of the musical legacy from the last decades of rock. By the time of the &quot;Scenes from a memory&quot; they had already managed to &quot;merge&quot; the rich tradition from the 1970s with the valuable developments of the 1980s (&quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; heavy metal, etc.). Then &quot;Six degrees of inner turbulence&quot; saw the band's first serious incursion into the 1990s trends drawing basically from some grungish styles. And with the &quot;Train of thought&quot; they go full-fledged on that same direction but now with more emphasis on strands from the oddly-called &quot;new metal&quot;. Seemingly, however, such a turn has not won the hearts of many fans, as can be witnessed in other reviews. It can be regarded as an understandable matter of tastes: some may find odd to listen to the privileged La Brie rapping, for instance. In any case, I should stress that the &quot;Train of thought&quot; can be said of having earned his place on Dream Theater's history, at least, as a firm, convincing step forward along this awesome and innovative musical synthesis project. Now, is it a good album? I think it certainly is, yet some tracks outperform the others. &quot;Endless sacrifice&quot; is an example worth bringing to bear to that respect. Ametal chorus resembling &quot;Blind faith&quot; with the other lyric parts much more melodic and showing a magnificent interlude. The sixth track is also a masterpiece: a sort of skilful Liquid Tension exercise. The rest of the tracks are of course remarkable as well and worthy praising. Nevertheless, in &quot;relative&quot; terms, the &quot;Train of thought&quot; is not, according to my opinion, the best Dream Theater we have enjoyed so far. It confirms the ever improving character of Dream Theater's musical interpretation, but the compositions in, say, the &quot;Images and words&quot;, &quot;Scenes from a memory&quot; and &quot;Six degrees of inner turbulence&quot; albums are all much more compellingly beautiful. The &quot;Train of thought&quot; is certainly enjoyable, but we all are waiting for Dream Theater to return with more of that majesty, of those wonderful, superb pieces of art, always coupled with virtuous technique, which captured our hearts in the first place and rendered us with the conviction that Dream Theater is one of the best prog-rock bands of the world.
B000002NCW|5.0|VOYAGER IS A MASTERPIECE born of musical genius. Rarely will you find an album that just gets better, and better, and better... the first time I gave Voyager a listen, I realized half way through that Mike had created something very special here. Voyager continues to sound as good, or better, to my ears every time I listen to it... and I've been playing Voyager for years. Over and over...<br />Particularly outstanding are &quot;The Song of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot;, &quot;Celtic Rain&quot;, &quot;Dark Island&quot;, &quot;Women of Ireland&quot;(Super Seductive!) and ... get the picture? It's great from beginning to end! The pieces never fail to elicit a powerful emotional response.<br />I often play this album for friends, dates, etc., and most comment on the mystical, dream-like quality of the music, as well as it's seductive power!<br />If you've never bought any of Mike Oldfield's music, Voyager is the perfect place to start --  but be forewarned, you might very well feel compelled by an irresistable force -- to aquire all of Mike's music.
B000069CWE|4.0|When I first got this albumn I hated it. After listening to Linkin Park's other stuff I found I liked it better. Now, after having owned it for about a year and a half I have come to the conclusion that I love this CD. Certainly Hybrid Theory is great and over all I like it better. However, this is their most creative albumn. This is not a remix no matter what people say. This is a new CD with lyrics that sound similar. It can't be compared to their other work since the goal of it is to reach out and experiment.<BR>If you thought that their other albumns were pretty negative (honestly they're not but some people seem to think they are) than this is down right depressing. This is Hybrid Theory in a dark, hellish, electronic world. The music is there but it leaves you alone with your thoughts and than throws in some electronic styling to remind you what its all about.<BR>Given that some people have been complaining about this I'll just say: the reason for the mech on the cover is that this is a reinterpretation of Hybrid Theory. Look at the mech on this, then look at Hybrid Theory's cover. The mech is an evolution of the soldier picture.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|My little adventure with the new and \\"improved\\" Britney Spears began when, after a friend listened to my mini album by Luca Turilli (who by the way is absolutely brilliant), she decided she must have a copy and snatched it right out from the CD player. When I asked her what I was going to do without any music, she threw \\"In the Zone\\" at my head and told me I could borrow it until she completed burning her copy of Demonheart. And with that she ran off laughing evilly, and left me standing there forlornly holding Britney's album. I've always hated pop music, but I decided to listen to it anyway with an open mind. I had no idea what type of evil the Pop Princess had unleashed upon the world until Track 1 began.<br />\\"Me against the Music\\" is exactly what the title describes: if her voice was ever good, it certainly isn't anymore...I guess that vocalists have to stay away from more than just American dairy products, nein? And even though Maddonna, the Pop Queen and British wannabe who Britney absolutely worships, duets with her, it still is very mediocre. The other two songs that include other music \\"artists\\" are \\"I Got That (Boom Boom)\\" and \\"Outrageous.\\" I had never even heard of, let alone listened to the Ying Yang twins until now, and from what I hear they are anything from enjoyable. And R. Kelly is brilliant at creating the most boring and stupid music I've ever heard, lyrics like \\"Outrageous in my sexy jeans.\\" <br />I don't really want to poke at anything other than the music on the album, but I have to say that Britney is trying way, way, way too hard to grow up. All we ever hear from her anymore is \\"I'm an adult now\\" and \\"I do what I want whenever I want.\\" Dude, just because you're of the legal American drinking and smoking age dosen't make you a mature adult. It's painfully obvious that she's trying to project her perception of being grown up in these songs, such as \\"Breathe on Me,\\" \\"The Hook Up\\" and \\"Touch of my Hand.\\" Britney claims that with these songs, she's gone onto territory no other musician (did I just call her that?!) has crossed. I don't know, but if you look at Pop-rock in general today, the only lyrics any of them can come up with today are overly sexual and purely vulgar. as Jane Russell said: \\"Sex appeal is good, but not in a bad taste. Then it's ugly.\\" But it seems it's the only type Britney and her followers can achieve...<br />I have to admit that there is one good song on this enitre album: Toxic. It's the only song I can actually listen to the whole way through, and even at that it took many listens to get used to. The only thing that makes is go great is cuz of the catchy tune. (Oh, and I never, ever EVER want to find myself on a plane that resembles the one in the music video.) In the end,  I will definetly not recommend this CD, it has no substance and the most it will do for your mind is clog up your brain like a paper towel used to clean the floor of a cinema after the opening night of the next Harry Potter movie. Whatever happened to when it was the REAL music that made the top 10, instead of this manufactured plastic? Oh, and I still don't have my Luca Turilli album back, I'm still stuck with \\"In the Zone.\\" It's like a curse that has been given to me. People give me such weird looks when they find it buried among my CD's. I sure have great friends, don't I.
B00003CXB4|4.0|When I first saw the Lion King it was with my sister and cousin at the theater. I thought it was the best. I still do but not this version of it. I would have given it five stars if it were not for the fact that there were changes made in the special edition version. Why did Disney add new songs to it and why isn't Elton John singing his songs. Instead it is some woman. This was really silly on Disney's part and doesn't make since.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|She can't sing. It also seems like she won't just go away. Why do her albums sell? It's all about the image. If she didn't have any music videos with her half-naked, would she sell any albums? Highly doubtful. I'm probably going to get alot of 'Not Helpful' feedback from this one but the truth had to be said.
B00007KQA3|4.0|I have only seen the VHS version, and am looking forward to seeing the DVD in light of the reviews here. Having seen the film over a dozen times, I feel safe sharing a few observations.<br />1. As others have pointed out: If you've never read Orwell's 1984, READ IT FIRST. If you don't enjoy - if &quot;enjoy&quot; is the right word - or understand the book (your loss), the movie likely will do little except baffle and annoy you.<br />2. If you have read the book and &quot;enjoyed&quot; it, see the film. Be warned: the script is not word-for-word Orwell. That'd be impossible short of a Masterpiece Theater-type miniseries (not a bad idea). <br />As it is, crucial and not-so-crucial elements of the novel have been compressed, altered, combined or deleted. The worst example of this probably is the novel's portrayal of Winston's entrapment by O'Brian. This potentially powerful, emotionally charged scene (which includes Julia) is inexcusably shortened and muted in the film, involving only Hurt and Burton. The movie suffers, and that's why I give it a 4 out of 5. <br />And it is true that the affair between Winston and Julia - while very physical - is not entirely warm, as one reviewer laments. Yet what should we expect from people born into this universe? These are world-weary individuals living with the constant dread of sure detection and destruction; they agree it must happen sooner or later. And it does. So the melancholy, futile mood of their relationship (especially on Winston's part) is reasonable and entirely appropriate, given the reality the characters inhabit. All along they're expecting to happen that which we can only hope, for their sakes, doesn't have to be. So for me, the performances work.<br />Despite drawbacks, the basic story IS there and would be valuable in a classroom setting to supplement (not replace!) the book. <br />3. Even those who read the book and hate the film must admit the cinematography captures the bleak, hopeless mood of the novel as well as any filmed version of a book ever has. No one who really &quot;gets&quot; the book will deny that, and it's worth seeing for that reason alone. I personally can't recall another movie that so consistently mirrors the look and feel of its source novel.<br />4. The soundtrack: I admit it's all I've known, but I enjoy the original. Yes, it gets in the way here and there. But think about it - the synthesizer-based music is so subtly mechanized (even the vocals) that it actually fits. Everything about the 1984 universe is false, doomed or both. And everything is soaked in hopelessness. So I agree with other reviewers that the Eurythmics' music makes for a dreamlike, surreal vibe that on the surface does not seem to fit at all...but does. <br />Incidentally...I've often wondered what the film would be like with no music at all, save the Party's broadcasted anthems, marches and whatnot. Think about it!<br />Also...the way the plaintive &quot;Julia&quot; plays over the final blackout of the end credits (vhs) is nothing less haunting. Some of you know what I mean. If not, listen to the lyrics - they  mesh perfectly with the final winter scene of the book (how I wish they'd shot the final conversation between Julia and Winston outside in the cold, gray wind where it should be, instead of inside the cafe...imagine THAT scene!). Still, that song - more than anything else in the film - is what's stuck with me ever since I first saw this movie. Knowing it's gone from the DVD gives me the hunch that I'll end up voting for the VHS. <br />Still, I look forward to seeing the disc...who knows, I may prefer it. They told me I'd hate the so-called &quot;director's cut&quot; of Blade Runner, which removed Decker's running commentary and that tacked-on, sunny epilogue. But they were wrong!<br />So if you've not seen 1984...read and familiarize yourself with the book, THEN see the movie. If you can't get into the book, the film probably will waste your time. If you can see both the DVD and the original VHS, do so - it should make for an interesting comparison.  <br />And if you end up depressed after seeing the film, it will have done its job. It's 1984 more and more all the time, you know.
B00000634J|5.0|This is the best collection of John Lennon out there. How can you go wrong with 20 great tracks on 1 cd? It features some great songs such as Imagine, Instant Karma, Jealous Guy, Power To The People, Woman, Watching The Wheels, and Happy Xmas (War Is Over). Any fan of great music needs this in their collection today!
B00000GAIW|5.0|For the new Tull enthusiast: Don't forget the overlooked but equally amazing songs on this album: Wond'ring Aloud, My God, Cheap Day Return, and Wind Up.  Also, even though this album is amazing, please don't think Aqualung is the ultimate Jethro Tull experience and that you need look no further to fully appreciate them.  You must check out a few other albums to comprehend the many facets of this incredible band.  The short list: &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot; and &quot;Songs From the Wood.&quot;  These are often overlooked, but are two of the musically strongest Tull albums.  Start there, and then add &quot;Heavy Horses,&quot; &quot;Too Old...,&quot; and the blues based &quot;This Was,&quot; to better appreciate this finest ever art-rock band.  There's much more, but this would be a great beginning introduction past &quot;Aqualung.&quot;  Happy listening!
0812968255|5.0|I'm awestruck - just got this today. To think it was written over 1800 years ago! Aurelius combines strict adherence to doing the right thing with a wild and dark sense of humor. The translation is right to the point and reaches me where I'm at.<br />If you feel as if you're pulled in too many directions by the pressures of contemporary life, this book may help anchor you. It gave me the sense that the ordeals I face have been faced in similar ways for a long, long time.  Circumstances have changed since the late Roman empire, and circumstances will doubtlessly change during the course of my life. Aurelius teaches me in the most direct terms how I can keep focus.<br />Here's an Aurelius quote that got me laughing:<br />\\"The way people behave. They refuse to admire their contemporaries, the people whose lives they share. No, but to be admired by Posterity - people they've never met and never will - that's what they set their hearts on. You might as well be upset by not being a hero to your great-grandfather.\\"<br />One Amazon reviewer did a wonderful job including some other quotes from the work. There are many from which to choose.<br />You'll doubtlessly find a good, cheap copy from a marketplace seller here. Snatch it!
B00005R87Q|1.0|This film was recommended to me by a friend who knew I love good action movies.... so I BOUGHT this one and the sequel too!  I was really disappointed, especially since the night before I saw MATRIX RELOADED, which is 10 times the action movie this bomb is. The plot on this turkey is so dumb that only a 12 year old could enjoy it. A pretty boy blonde cop goes \\"undercover\\" to live among an east L.A. car racing gang that likes to steal, carry weapons, engages in road rage, and are generally are obsessed with sex kittens and beer. The cop does everything he can to get found out by the thugs... he falls in love with one of the girlfriends of the gangmembers, picks fights with them, and says he has NO money, but drives a car with tens of thousands of dollars worth of upgrades to his car... and doesnt even mind putting it up as a wager in a couple of races... make sense?  Okay... he ultimately makes friends with the leader of the gang and makes friends with him then actually feels sorry for him in the end and gives the car the police department gave him at the end of the final race!!  Good grief!
B000002LIM|5.0|I bought my Batman score in 1989 and it is the one CD that has never been rotated out of the playlist here.  The opening score builds and builds, and when it finally crests, you know you're in for a magnificent ride until the last note of the last track.  I have enjoyed introducing friends to the fantastic sounds of Danny Elfman over the years, and the Batman score is always the first dose.  If you're looking for a gift of music for friends or family (that's why I stopped in today) you can't go wrong here.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I heard the soundtrack first not knowing what movie it was from and I immediately fell in love with it. It's exciting and powerful and makes you get these images in your head of actual pirates and their fancy. It puts you in the decade and within the very setting. It's so breathtaking and you can never get tired of it. The music presents all elemants, excitement, sorrow, mystery, and piracy expression. I absolutely love it and reccomend it to anyone who's searching for an outstanding classical soundtrack. It will definitely get your heart racing.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|To compare this movie to American Beauty is completely off base.<br />This movie is neither a penetrating investigation into mid-life crisis nor does it provide the least insight into Japan, either modern or cultural.<br />The awards it has gotten are purely the movie industry's way of rewarding its insiders and they make a mockery of the supposed integrity behind the awards process.<br />Bill Murray has done some great work; this movie does not add to his reputation. And, to be a famous director's daughter! We should all have such credentials. The idea that a director's reputation is tied to the quality of the work has always been somewhat suspect, but this movie really shows how corrupt the internal Hollywood processes are.
B00011RPB0|5.0|This movie is really lovely - if you're expecting Bill Murray via SNL this ain't it! It's very subtle, atmospheric and lovely. Why did so many people expect a big-budget piece of garbage that THE US seems to gobble up? Maybe it's not everyone's ideal, but it's so enjoyable. The flower arranging scene, the Roxy Music moment, and especially the end. We're not supposed to know what he said to her.
B000002TQV|5.0|Having systematically trashed &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot; I found myself at the guilt-ridden end of the spectrum when my reviews were read aloud to a Radiohead-partial friend who wasn't pleased. So, I admit that I should have considered the full honorable weight of Radiohead's bold and adroit markmanship on the aforementioned albums. But, &quot;The Bends&quot; is by far, a superior record, from start to dramatic finish. Music like this is sorely lacking in today's music scene, and this album offers such a startlingly full and panormaic sound with heart, soul and chops to spare, that anything other then their subsequent follow up, pales deathly. The opening track is a spacey begginning point in which the lyrics don't gel together as sensibly as they should, but, no matter here: the trip we are being taken on is already premptively established as a full sonic wonder. The title track is an awesome mod/Who send-up that has sweeping power and subtly understated guitar prowess that nails it's message home in one blast. The next few tracks are gentle ballad-esque gems that have a high ranking position in their musical empire's hierchy. These tracks are stunning in their arrangments, release and control, and beauty. All in all, the sum of Radiohead is greater then it's parts and as a result, the finished product offers up slices of abstract and affecting musical personality that weaves a multicolored tapestry of majestic rock, sorely missing from many of their contemporaries. A classic stunner. Buy it here at Amazon, and proceed to buy their equally awesome followup, &quot;OK Computer&quot;.
B000002H33|5.0|2 years after the success of Ride the Lightning, Metallica released Master of Puppets, their last album with bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a bus accident shortly after this was released. If you listen to the albums (*in this order) Ride the Lightning (rtl), Master of Puppets (mop), and ...And Justice for All (ajfa), you can see the progression of Metallica's sound from thrash to complexity. Puppets is the medium, bringing not only thrash metal to the listener, but also some complex songs, while RTL brings mostly thrash (some may choose to differ, but by definition of thrash metal- harsh sounding metal with discussion of death, killing, destruction, usually at a quick tempo), and AJFA brings mostly complex music with seemingly disjointed drum beats and a series of variations of the same riff within a single song, Master of Puppets brings thrash and complexity together with several varying riffs, singing of death (more with the theme of insanity), and quick drum beats.<br />Battery: just like Ride the Lightning, the cd begins with a soft intro. I find that this one shows metallica has grown to a more musically mature state with this intro than Fight Fire with Fire, but both are excellent thrashers. The thing with Battery is though, after the acoustic introduction is over, when the distorted guitars come in, there is a little fuzzy noise (at 0:38 and 0:41), probably someone hit the recording equipment while it was converting tape to cd. drags a bit at the end (like a lot of songs on ajfa) but my friend argues that Metallica give u that extra bit of song at the end to head bang just a little more :) A-<br />Master of Puppets- the second metallica song i heard at first (first was Ride the Lightning). Structurally, it is different than Ride the Lightning because there isnt that long of a guitar medly, there is a slow part and a prolonged introduction (great riff in that one). The guitar work is just as amazing as Ride the Lightning and the solo is excellent. I dont know how to get that stacatto that fast. A+ (deals with drugs btw, but didnt one of the members get out of rehab shortly before st.anger?)<br />The thing that should not be- catchy introduction, I had to listen to it a couple of times before i actually took a liking to it (but thats the case with most metallica songs for me at least). The solo is excellent. i believe it deals with hallucinating. A-<br />Sanitarium- a great ballad, and just like Fade to Black, the ending guitar owns, but you really cant get better than Fade to Black. deals with people in a... sanitarium! surprise! A-<br />Disposable Heroes- a song that almost matches the title track in length. the chorus is excellent and the guitar work is great. at around 1:00 all of the instruments playing, that part is quite catchy, and i found myself trying to see what they say in the chorus after the first time i heard this song. deals with sending people to war. A<br />Leper Messiah- i first hated this song when i first listened to it, but i got to like it after a while. great beat. deals with... greed of commercial business? B+<br />Orion- dreamy instrumental. i think Ktulu is more aggressive, while this is more laid back. both are excellent and should both be in the top 15 songs of metallica. first guitar solo at (2:57) is excellent and can create tears if you concentrate and think about a emotionally crushing event in your life. A+<br />Damage Inc.- I hate the intro to this song! they should change it! but after, i would have to say that this song is just about as fast and heavy as some songs on Reign in Blood, which is one of the fastest tempoed albums ive heard. B+<br />If u are new to metal, buy Ride the Lightning along with this, but listen to RTL first, then bury yourself into this one. You will be happy.
0694524476|4.0|I listened to this on unabridged audio while travelling back and forth to work.  From a plot point of view, this book is very, well, linear.  Boy Shepherd has a dream, gets it interpreted, learns of treasure buried by the pyramids, talks to a wise king, learns he is on a quest for his personal legend, travels to Egypt, etc etc.  There are no real plot twists (beyond one near the end), and the story is simple and straightforward.<BR> <BR>And, still, somehow, both spiritually interesting and thought-provoking.  It has the sense of a legend or myth in and of itself, and had some wonderful lines to it (&quot;What goes into a man's mouth is never evil, but what comes out of it is often so,&quot; and so on).  It made me think a few times, and that's always welcome.  The notion that everyone has a Personal Legend - and that the universe will try to get you onto the path of said Legend, is a very solid piece of interesting writing.<BR> <BR>I think I had less of a &quot;this shall change my life!&quot; reaction than most I've spoken to who've read this, but at the same time, I quite ended up thinking about it for a few days (I only now just write this review, but I finished it last week).<BR> <BR>Definitely recommended.<BR> <BR>'Nathan
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban's gifted voice is mature beyond his years. Every word becomes an experience.  Josh does not merely sing his lyrics, he expresses them as feelings and those feelings come through to the listener...melancholia, romance, elation.  Definitely listening pleasure.
0312995423|2.0|Based on his past writings, I really expected to become engrossed in this book and hang onto every word.  Instead, whole chapters got skipped, like those cat-and-mouse chapters with Becker and the assassin.  Cheap trick for padding out the story.  This is a book I wish had come from the library rather than purchased from a major discount store.  Save your money.
B00005YW4H|4.0|2002's ''Come Away With Me'' album earned Norah Jones a name on the already much crowed mainstream music scene though Jones was accepted as a welcomed surprise. The general public and critics alike embraced the pianist and a new star was born. <BR>''Come Away With Me'' has been an enormous seller in almost every country across the world and it's still a big seller, despite Norah Jones recently having released her sophomore album ''Feels Like Home''. On paper Norah Jones doesn't seem like the winning formula, however she has certainly proved the sceptics wrong innumerable times. So does ''Come Away With Me'' live up to the hype surrounding it? A firm No is the correct answer, however it's still an impressive release, especially for a debutante. <br />The opener ''Don't Know Why'' proved to be the perfect start for Norah Jones as it instantly became a favourite among radio and listeners. Its cross-over appeal had teenagers and adults enjoying the tune. In my opinion it's one of the best offering on ''Come Away With Me''. The combination of the subtle music and Norah Jones' vocal, makes ''Don't Know Why'' a pleasure listening to throughout the song. ''Cold Cold Heart'' provides the listener with smoothing and begging vocals from Jones to melt a lover's cold heart. The song is a testament that Jones is capable of making a song sound like her composition, when in fact the original is due to that of Hank Williams. ''Feelin' The Same Way'' was an instant favourite of mine upon listening to the album for the first and it still remains so. It's one of the more upbeat songs on the record and leaning more towards a country-inspired sound than the jazz-like sound that is primarily dominating the album as a whole. The title-track ''Come Away With Me'' is a gentle and seductive listen, however I don't care all that much for it. ''Turn Me On'' sees Norah Jones give a rather good vocal performance. She stretches her voice a bit and that is what is missing in general on the album. Make no mistake about it, Norah Jones does have an overall good voice, however I wish she would make more of it on ''Come Away With Me''. At time it does become a tad monotonous, which really is a shame as I'm sure she is capable of more. \\"I've Got To See You Again\\" is a highlight as well. Its seductive and silky vocals by Jones suits the song perfectly. <br />So what is my main problem with ''Come Away With Me'' when it consists of a good potion of top-notch productions? Well as mention above her voice is a tad monotonous at times. Songs like ''Lonestar'', ''Seven Years'' and ''The Nearness Of You'' does nothing for me at all, mainly due to the bland vocals and the uninspired music. Another issue, mainly due to the overall sound of ''Come Away With Me'', is the album sounds very much alike upon the first few listens. It's quite hard to distinguish the songs from one another, however the memorable offerings are more than enjoyable to make you remember those. <br />Despite a few flaws ''Come Away With Me'' is worth a purchase for the listener, who is in the mood for something a tad different than the overproduced sex-kittens of yesterday and today. Sure there are few ''rotten'' ones, however the quality of the better songs outweighs the less than forgettable tunes. ''Come Away With Me'' saw a promising start for a new artist and hopefully Norah Jones will continue to evolve in the future. <br />Overall Rate: 8.0/10
B00012QM8G|5.0|I mean seriously, if you'd stop b*tch*ng about the extras or the disc or 'manufacturing errors' (which I saw none of), then you'd see that this is a beautiful masterpiece that will be treasured by all forever.<br />Schindler's List is as moving as The Passion of the Christ.
B00011RPB0|5.0|The best movie I have seen in ages. Though many people found it over their heads and missed most of the humor and didn't see how truly dazzling the story is. Going beyond the cliched older man/younger woman relationship, Lost in Translation has a great father/daughter type relationship that shows how anyone can get lost.
B000002U82|5.0|Everyone knows this album.  This is the album that brought Pink Floyd to the mainstream.  It's one of the best selling albums of all-time, and for good reason.  There is the usual Pink Floyd kind of experimentalism, but it's given enough hooks that it can appeal to virtually anyone.  \\"Breathe\\" is a perfect example of this.  A passive listen will reveal a pleasant pop song.  However, read the lyrics and you'll find Roger Waters' usual dash of bitter cynicism.  This was Roger's first real concept album, and it features tons of his outstanding lyrics.  Unlike on many of the albums that came after, everyone contributes here though.  \\"On The Run\\" is the most experimental piece on here, as it takes a bunch of noises combined with a frantic keyboard to give a great impression of being, as the title would indicate, on the run.  After a somewhat soothing first two songs, a collage of alarms will be sure to wake you up for \\"Time\\", the album's best song.  Beginning with Nick Mason's great drums and Roger Waters' bass giving an effect that greatly resembles the sound of a clock ticking.  The song then gets going with David Gilmour's agressive vocals, singing some of Roger Waters' best lyrics ever.  Richard Wright then comes in to do some singing of his own, before Gilmour delivers a staggering guitar solo.  This is one of those songs that you really can't not like.  It is then followed by Wright's composition, \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\".  Building from a sparse piano, this song hits an amazing climax, featuring some of the most incredible vocals ever recorded from Clarre Torry.  \\"Money\\" is the song that everyone knows, and is a prime example of how this album is accessible yet brilliant.  Spearheaded by an extremely catchy Roger Waters bassline, David Gilmour sings this great Waters song about how money can corrupt people, which is ironic considering the single was a massive hit and made them tons of money.  It then continues on with \\"Us and Them\\", one of Waters' first social commentaries, something which would become increasingly normal from him on later albums.  It doesn't sound much like the typical Waters song though, as Wright (who wrote the music for the song)'s keyboards dominate it.  Dick Parry even contributes some saxophone.  As is the case with most songs on here, Gilmour sings it and does an outstanding job of it.  The song drags on a little too long, but is still a great piece.  \\"Any Colour You Like\\" is the last time Pink Floyd would just let loose and do some jamming on an album until _The Division Bell_, which came over 20 years later.  Wright and Gilmour dominate this great instrumental.  \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\" close out the album, and are the only two songs sung by Waters.  \\"Brain Damage\\" is a fairly simple song, but the lyrics are clearly a tribute to Syd Barrett, the band's original frontman who's mind was wrecked by drugs.  \\"Eclipse\\" is the album's triumphant closer, which the band performs incredibly, making it one of the best album closers ever.<br />As a whole, this album is one of the few that can combine accessible melodies and fairly simple song structures with strange experimenting, and the result is a fantastic album that must be heard by any music listener.  Although not Pink Floyd's best, it's still very much worth some attention.<br />Song ratings:<BR>Speak To Me/Breathe: 8/10<BR>On The Run: 6/10<BR>Time: 10/10<BR>The Great Gig In The Sky: 8.5/10<BR>Money: 8/10<BR>Us and Them: 9/10<BR>Any Colour You Like: 9/10<BR>Brain Damage: 8.5/10<BR>Eclipse: 9.5/10
B000002897|5.0|Screaming Tree's is just as good as Pearl Jam or Nirvana, and it's a pity that still no-one has really HEARD their stuff. Sure they've heard the name but this band has yet to grace their ears and probably won't unless you shove it down their throats. :)
B00005A0N5|5.0|A little history here..<br /><br />Before 2003, I've been a fan of both goth (the 80s' variety) and metal, but I never heard of \\"goth metal\\" or anything in the genre until I bought Evanescence's \\"Fallen\\" which I listened to quite frequently last year.  Having liked that CD, I was thinking that Amy Lee's crew was on to something good, fresh and new. Little did I know at that time that Evanescence was not in the vanguard but just merely America's representative in a vast, but mostly European genre that's been around for years.  Kinda like the tip of a very large, but mostly submerged iceberg (at least to American ears).<br /><br />Then I came here to Amazon in Fall 2003, checked out the \\"Customers who bought items in your Recent History also bought\\" links where \\"Fallen\\" was and worked my way through Lacuna Coil, the Gathering and some of the others Euro Goth Metal groups and stumbled upon Nightwish and \\"Oceanborn\\".  I played \\"Sacrament of Wilderness\\" first becaue the title sounded interesting and heard some incredibly good guitars and drums backing an operatic female voice.  My first reaction was \\"Huh? what's up with that?\\" and then after a few more replays and trying some of the other available clips here (\\"Stargazers\\" \\"Gethsemane\\" and \\"Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean\\")..I'm now saying to myself WOW!  Then I listen to clips from their other albums and I'm hooked!<br /><br />\\"Oceanborn\\" is actually the third Nightwish album I bought (I later picked up \\"Over The Hills and Far Away\\" and \\"Angels Fall First\\", and then the American release of \\"Once\\".  However I think it's their best album and is my favorite.  Actually, I now consider it one of my all-time favorite albums. My biggest regret is that I did not get this CD sooner. Every member of this band is incredbily talented, and Tarja..what a voice!!! both straight and operatic (she's mostly opera on this CD).  I dread the day when a opera company makes her an offer she can't refuse. My view on the songs:<br /><br />Stargazers - A great intro/lead-off song...fast, furious and inspiring.  You are greeted with the power, glory and awe that is Nightwish.  Tarja is at her operatic best here and in other songs (5/5)<br /><br />Gethsemane - (4.5/5) Great song, especially great chorus.<br /><br />Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean (4/5) - starts off OK but builds to a good finish..as for the death metal male vocals (DMMVs), I didn't like it first but then I got used to it.  It is what it is. It's all in context. Do you really want Tarja to play the \\"Devil\\"?  On the other hand, if you like your DMMVs five-alarm strong and not for the faint of heart, check out Tristania. The DMMVs in \\"Devil\\" are mild in comparison.<br /><br />Sacrament of Wilderness (5/5)- Fast and march-like..maybe one of my all time favorite songs.  For all who have tameless hearts.<br /><br />Passion and the Opera - (4.5/5) Another great song.  I like Tarja's vocals in the middle-end of the song.<br /><br />Swanheart - (3/5) Least favorite, only because it's slow.<br /><br />Moondance - (4/5) Like other reviewers say, it's basically a Russian(or Russian-cum-Finnish?)folk-metal instrumental.  Catchy and fun to listen to.  Reminds me, in parts, of the 1970's NFL Game of The Week highlight music.<br /><br />The Riddler - (4.5/5)Great, Awesome.  You can almost sing along to it, which seldom happens in a Nighwish song.<br /><br />Pharaoh Sails to Orion - (5/5) DMMVs are kicked up a notch in this one over Devil Deep Dark Ocean. This song has really grown on me and is I think one of the best on the CD, especially from midway (\\"reveal your face to me\\") and up to the end. Opera and speed goth metal at its best!<br /><br />Walking in the Air - (4.5/5) A beautiful, slower song..Tarja is at her best here..starts good and bulds to an uptempo great finish.  No wonder it's a favorite among Nightwish fans.<br /><br />All in all, this is a CD worth every dollar, pound or euro you will spend and this band is truly above and beyond many metal bands today.  I've only known Nighwish for a few months and I already consider them to be one of my all-time favorite groups and this one is my favorite Nightwish CD, even better than \\"Once\\".orite groups and this one is my favorite Nightwish CD, even better than \\"Once\\".
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Many things fascinate about this wonderful movie, but one of the most fascinating here on Amazon is those who hate it enough to write repeated negative reviews, and then to complain about ballot stuffing from those who love it. <br />As for the DVD, it could have been a better DVD for an excellent film. It's only to be hoped that Criterion or someone will eventually produce the DVD with all the extras we deserve - I'd really like a Bill Murray commentary) and without the previews (which - admittedly - you can fast forward).<br />In a way I don't think what anyone here has to say on the movie matters much. If you're here because you wanted to buy it, you won't listen to the negative reviews (which are mostly far from persuasive and too frequently barely even literate - an indication of the people who don't get it perhaps?). If you're here because you hate it, you won't listen to the positive reviews either.<br />There seems not to be much middle ground. All I can say is that for me it was absolutely unforgettable. Coppola's direction is assured beyond her years, as is Johansson's performance. Bill Murray puts his years in the business to good effect. Accord's cinematography is beautiful, barely augmenting natural light most of the time so it doesn't get that &quot;Hollywood&quot; look. And the soundtrack is both hip and spare.<br />You almost certainly came to this page with preconceptions anyway. If you didn't, then you have to try for yourself. As one reviewer said earlier, to some people caviare will only ever be a mouthful of fish eggs. As I write it's number 7 on the DVD charts here. A lot of people obviously appreciate caviare.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Love it, Love it, Love it!  These songs are so romantic and passionate.  Buy this if you're looking for something to take you away from the hum drum world and totally immerse you in a world of passion.  Even though some songs are in other languages you don't really have to know what he's saying to appreciate the passion because singing about love and love in any language transcends words.  It just hits you deep in your soul.  For example, &quot;Si Volvieras a Mi&quot;, is a beautifully simple song about love lost and the yearning to get it back.   He's questioning how he's going to live without her, describing the different ways how this love is like.  The Spanish words for this song are simply so exquisitely passionate, that actually, the translation in English is somewhat lacking.  But if you must have translations start by going to his website. There on the message board you can ask anyone how to find the translations.  The English song like, &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot;, is simply powerful!  I saw him in concert and this song brought down the house!  He sang and played the piano and totally gave of himself!!! This is a guy who doesn't have to lipsink!! It's just so refreshing that this 23 yr.old guy can have this great voice, and sing passionately about love without being dirty and vulgar like current music trends.  <BR>So if you have a yearning for some passion to fill your soul, buy this!  When you get it, listen to this cd somewhere by yourself and lay down and close your eyes and let his singing and music just carry you away on your own personal journey!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wish I could give this series a 10 out of 5 because it well deserved it.  I am a scifi fan and there is nothing much I can add to the 700+ positive reviews at current, but I will say this...compared to the first 14 episodes of any scifi series, Firefly blows it out of the water.  Some series take 2-3 seasons before they start to get really good....Firefly is great from the very begining....buy NOW and watch and watch and watch many many times.  Oh and Fox I hate you people for what you did to this wonderfull series.
B00007LTIA|4.0|Here are some observations from a real old-timer. Progressive rock was invented when I was a teenager. It changed my whole life -- or at least, that's what I thought it was doing, at the time. Now in my late 40s, almost all the albums that moved me to tears back then have lost their magic. Genesis, Gentle Giant, Soft Machine, King Crimson... I just don't listen to them. When I go to my vinyl collection, I'm more likely to play old Isley Brothers records from back in the day. There are exactly two &quot;prog&quot; albums I still play: Tales from Topographic Oceans, and Relayer. If you are a guitar player, buy either one, and weep. You are not worthy!! If you are a composer, buy Tales. I agree with another reviewer who said that the band overextended themselves on this one -- but what a grand, grand failure it is. The musicianship is staggering. (Even more so on Relayer, however!) There are flashes of compositional brilliance that will send chills down your spine. Sure, there are parts that drag -- kind of like a movie with brilliant actors in it who don't have decent lines, but you love how well they're doing with the limited material they've been given. But then there are plenty of sections that blaze with passion and imagination. Hardly a minute goes by when Steve Howe doesn't do something &quot;impossible&quot;. Highly recommended.

0425152251|5.0|I'm a middle-aged person and I know very little about philosophy, having taken an introductory philosophy course over 35 years ago in college.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I took it from the library, thinking it was Sophie's Choice.  I soon discovered my mistake, but it turned out fine.  <br />In middle life, after your parents die and perhaps other friends or parents of friends, you begin to think much more about the meaning of life, eternity, the soul, etc.  Having very little academic background but lots of ideas of my own, I loved reading about the history of thought.<br />I recommend the book to anyone not too conceited, who has not studied philosophy and has questions about where all this came from, eternity, the soul, God, life...

6305603847|5.0|I don't get it...how can film critics continue to fail in their reviews of the conceptual film that so perfectly visualizes Roger Waters' utterly brilliant concept album &quot;Pink Floyd The Wall&quot;?  Why can't they seem to appreciate a movie that all Pink Floyd fans I've ever known (including myself) find to be such a tremendous interpretation, albeit it at times an admittedly depressing one?<br />What we have is a character study of A Big Rock Star who could be anyone but is actually a combination of two former founding Pink Floyd bandmates, Syd Barrett and (project mastermind) Roger Waters.  The rock star (&quot;Pink Floyd&quot;, played by Sir Bob Geldof, pre-&quot;Band-Aid&quot; and knighthood) has had a rather interesting life which is shown in flashback (and the occasional animated hallucinatory) sequence to World War II (where his father, like Roger Waters' own dad, was killed in action in Italy).  Awkward in childhood without a father (unusual in those days) and castigated by schoolmasters (at one time busted during class for writing &quot;poetry&quot; -actually the lyrics to the Floydian signature piece &quot;Money&quot;), Pink eventually hits it big, marries...and then begins to lose control of it all, eventually leading to the meltdown that is occurring in...what is supposed to be a hotel room in the Hollywood Hills during yet another tour.<br />It's a bit mainstream to be considered an &quot;art flick&quot;, but it has settled comfortably into &quot;cult flick&quot; status, deservedly so.  Roger Waters' original inspirations that led to the Wall&quot; album -increasing distance between the artists and their fans, alienation from societal institutions such as school, the death of a father Roger Waters never knew, the eventual insanity of close friend Syd Barrett- are all well-covered and simply enough portrayed so that subtle symbolism is never needed.  The movie stands as a perfect visual accompaniment to the album...and in fact is a bit broader, particularly considering the extra themes written for the flashback scenes involving Pink's father.<br />For me the best of the smorgasbord of extra features is the commentary track, if only to actually hear Roger Waters' input and insights (and his brilliant Irish accent when mimicking Bob Geldof).  Waters has a deserved reputation for being a bit reclusive when dealing with the media, so getting a chance to hear him discussing one of Pink Floyd's defining moments is particularly enjoyable for me as a Pink Floyd fan.  He DID make it a point to mention that he thought the film was a bit too dark and didn't reflect the humor that he felt was found throughout &quot;The Wall&quot; as an album.  I listened to &quot;The Wall&quot; again after hearing that comment and have yet to understand what the hell he was talking about.  If there's any humor in &quot;The Wall&quot; at all, I've never heard it.  It always seemed as brilliant and as heavy and darkly depressing as the movie is...which is probably why I've always liked the movie.  See it if you haven't.  If you've ever wondered what Pink Floyd was about, see this movie.  Like the band itself, you'll either love it passionately or you just won't get it at all.icularly considering the extra themes written for the flashback scenes involving Pink's father. <br />For me the best of the smorgasbord of extra features is the commentary track, if only to actually hear Roger Waters' input and insights (and his brilliant Irish accent when mimicking Bob Geldof).

B00018D44U|5.0|Far more than Outkast, Britney Spears, or Janet Jackson--more than all of them combined! Norah Jones is the most controversial figure in pop music today.  This born attention-grabber has roiled the music world with her extreme positions and outrageous insistence that in music, what matters is sophistication, skill, subtlety and beauty.  Music critics from the NY Times to the hippest underground journals are united in their outrage--they've even resurrected the formerly banned-as-insensitive terms &quot;yuppie rock&quot; and &quot;Muzak&quot; to express the depths of their fury and hatred of everything Norah Jones stands for.  Why...why...they sputter...her fans don't even &quot;rip&quot; her music!  They actually go into bankrupt record chains and...hide the kids...BUY her ENTIRE CD!  Worst of all, her fans are...OLD!<br />Ha! This is fun. For a guy whose pop music touchstones include Ray Charles, Etta James, Hank Williams, the Band, Steely Dan, Al Green, Boz Scaggs and Little Feat, Norah Jones is redemption after years of juvenilia rising to the top, and music that truly draws on the American strains of folk, jazz, blues and country consigned to the margins, it is a triumph to see that this modest character with exuberent talent and fearless taste come onto the scene to redeem everything that was most soulful and permanent about the great pop music of the 50s, 60s and 70s.<br />It is not an accident that geniuses like Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Tom Waits and Dolly Parton make appearances on this album.  These aren't artists who jump on the latest bandwagon, nor do they make &quot;yuppie muzak.&quot;  They recognize the intense soulfulness of Norah's voice, the incredible power of her restrained yet incredible Handsome Band, and their combined ability to continue the Americana conversation between black and white music that is probably the greatest thing about our country.  That conversation has been hard to hear these past 25 years, in which TV's endless search for novelty became the dominant force in music.  Now it's roaring back in the form of this modest little girl.<br />In my opinion, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is a major step forward for Ms. Jones.  As fine as her debut was, this album hits deeper.  Part of it is the variety.  There's less jazz here (although the final cut, an Ellington tune with lyrics by Norah is perhaps her jazziest effort ever) and more soul/R&amp;B.  Every time I listen to this addictive album, I have a different favorite cut, but the one that really sticks is &quot;What Am I to You,&quot; a deceptively simple R&amp;B torch song that sets Norah's fabulous Wurlizter piano against a smacking drum line by Levon Helm, and a sobbing organ by Garth Hudson.  Her vocal on this track reminds me a little bit of Ann Peebles.  The Dolly Parton and Tom Waits cuts are also great, as is her version of Townes Van Zandt's sad waltz, &quot;Be Here to Love Me.&quot;  Probably the most accomplished song Jones writes is &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; which takes you on quite a journey, before you even realize it.<br />The criticism of this album out there strikes me as almost political, as if the guardians of pop culture are trying desperately to make Norah Jones uncool, right now, I guess to make way for some trendoid band like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.  Don't fall for it.  This music is DEEPLY COOL.r novelty became the dominant force in music.

0451191153|5.0|Annotation: The Fountainhead is about an architect, Howard Roark, who builds for himself and not for society. He is hated because he won't sacrifice his ideals in order to please a client. Other architects use designs from prior periods in history that many times serve no functional purpose, such as Roman columns or gargoyles. There is not much originality and society likes what they are told to like. Howard is often considered a rebel, but should be considered a genius because he doesn't steal others' designs but relies on his own standards. <br />Author Bio:  Ayn Rand, the founder of her unique philosophy objectivism, was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905. As a young child she taught herself to read and write and decided at the age of nine to become a fictional writer. In 1925 with Russia under communist rule she obtained permission to visit family in the United States; she would never return to communist Russia. Her first novel, We the Living, was published in 1936 but it was not until The Fountainhead was published in 1943 that she became nationally recognized and acclaimed. She died in 1982. Every book published during her life remains in print. <br />Evaluation:  The Fountainhead is the best book I have ever read. Howard Roark was created as the perfect being, the hero of this novel, according to Ayn Rand's philosophical views. It is a very good introduction to this view, called Objectivism. Roark is the beneficiary of everything that he does; he acts in his own rational self-interest. This is a highly condensed version of the basis of Objectivism. In order to appreciate this novel you must open your mind to anything, you may not agree with the philosophy but I assure you that you will learn more about yourself and your own morals. To understand this book you need to see the deeper meaning of things not just the simple plot. This book is not a thriller nor a mystery, but a thought-provoking masterpiece.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This has to be the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. Overrated. I do like movies that delve in the human condition. But this movie was missing something. What it did was identify the problem but it did not attempt to solve the problem. That can work with some stories but not this one. Even the so called fun shots were really boring.  The photography was good. The acting was on target. And the story had potential. This movie is a waste of time.
B000002U8G|5.0|Pink Floyd's Meddle to me is the most beautifully put-together album ever. With such an eclectic and diverse range of songs, The Floyd really demonstrates their mastery of progressive rock. From the dramatic &quot;One of these Days&quot;, to the light-hearted &quot;San Tropez&quot;, this album is Pink Floyd at their most creative level. The finale &quot;Echoes&quot; alone makes this album stand out from other Floyd classics. Perhaps withstanding the exception of Wish you were here's &quot;Shine on you crazy diamond&quot;, echoes is Pink Floyd's most elaborate and layered work, and consequentially their most impressive. No song that I have ever heard left such a profound impact on me. Like a successfuly artistic movie, with every listen you can hear new components, experience new sounds, and enjoy further mind-blowing instrumentals. With its dramatic symphonic impression, overtoned by a collection of intelligent, jazzy tunes, Meddle is the complete progressive rock compilation.<br />Perhaps providing some evidence towards the impact of this album, anyone familiar with a little British act known as &quot;The Charlatans&quot; may be able to detect a bit of sampling from Meddle within their work. The Charlatans song &quot;Here Comes a soul saver&quot; has within it a guitar riff very remeniscent to one heard in Meddle's &quot;Fearless&quot;.
B000089RVX|5.0|I can not believe how incredible Evanescence is. Amy Lee is very talented. At times I think that the lyrics where written with me in mind because I can relate to almost all of them. Not only are they a talented band but they have a lead singer who can sing. I get so sick of all these bands where usually only the backup singers can sing. I hope the next CD will be as good!
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Without wishing to put a hex on the old boy, I think it is now safe to say he's back: you can buy a new Bowie CD without wondering whether you'll need to wince when you stick it in the machine. The last time you safely do that was about 1980, and they weren't called CDs then.<br />This is a very good follow-up to the seriously under-rated Heathen. At first I didn't think much of Heathen, and I am ashamed to say I said so on this site in a rather intemperate review. Heathen's grown on me, which is what a good rock record ought to do. It's what all David's old records did as well.<br />Significantly, Reality is a lot like Heathen. It seems that David's finally relinquished the desire to be really cutting edge (fingers burned there on Earthling, I dare say) and is acting his own age, without forgetting his history.<br />Reality rocks, but never too hard (as, say, Outside tried to - the track Reality itself strays closest to the line, and it is the least successful entry because of it), and lays back equally nicely: one thing I always liked about Bowie was his killer middle eights, hooks and vocal melodies. They're here in abundance throughout the record. Fall Dogs Bomb The Moon (great title by the way! very Ashes to Ashes!) is especially winsome.<br />As there was in Heathen, in Pablo Picasso there is an amusing cover of an artist of Bowie's own vintage, and the Mike Garson jazz influence again wafts over the trenches in the form of the delightful closer, Bring Me The Head Of The Disco King.<br />And it grows on me with every listen. I'm almost looking forward to the next Bowie album. Now there's a feeling I haven't had in a while.<br />Olly Buxton
B00005JM02|5.0|All of you people that think this movie is a waste of time, you are dumb because this was a really great movie, i would recommend this movie to anyone at any age.
6305882592|5.0|In an age of cynicism, bitterness, and pointless movies about horny teenagers, this film is a breath of fresh air. Movies like this simply do not get made anymore. People who hate it miss the point, it is about love and life and enjoying who you are. Movine and wonderful, and Ruth Gordon is darling. To those who hated it, please watch it again, and open your mind and your heart. You will be surprised at what you find there.
0767817478|1.0|People who rate this as 5 star i mean what in movie you thought was cool.I thoguth it was interesting until they showed godzilla<BR>I was like Tyranosarus Rex with Spikes what the hell happen to Godzilla.Then from then on the movie sucked.People rate this as 5 stating that its better then a moth showing up and better then those cheesy flicks???

B00005221L|4.0|Arnold in an updated version of Most Dangerous Game against an alien hunter who can be invisible, has a force field, has heat sensors, and super advanced weaponry.  This is one of the most memorable aliens in the history of cinema.<br />Arnold's group of elite soldiers (they appear to be Rangers) are sent on a rescue mission in a South American jungle.  It turns out there are more than just bad guys there.  There is also, the above mentioned alien who loves to hunt them down one by one and take something from the victim as a trophy.<br />There are some memorable lines, especially what Arnold says to the alien after he sees what he looks like under his body armor.  <br />Arnold does seem to take more punishment than appears to be humanly possible and survive.  If you can get by that, you will highly enjoy this film.  Definately worth owning!
0783114222|3.0|As the series begins it becomes apparent that every aspect of the Lunar Program will be shown which is a welcome sight since next to nothing is usually mentioned about the other missions especially the last one Apollo 17.  The attention to detail really pulls you in and you are drawn into the individuals that made up the program.  Unfortunately, the series does drag on and the repetion of lunar landings gets as tedious as I believe they must have been to the public, hence the end to the program.  Also, their are very Ron Howardish scenes of people making final speeches in honor of different things and this contrasted with the realism of the technical scenes.  But the worst thing about the series has to be the damn music.  I am not of fan of film score unless its for some over-the-top epic adventure, but when dealing with real people in real situations, this bombastic mess can completely get in the way.  Now the good news; stand out episodes in order include (forgot some titles): Spider, 1968, Mare Tranqualitis(although Buzz Aldrin was shown as a bit of a whiner), Part 1, the Last episode, and Apollo One .  Original Wives Club was good except for the last scene between the Lovells. It seemed straight out of a TGIF sitcom.  The rest of the episodes seemed to blur together especially the geologist one, I understand they wanted to make the science intresting but I've seen PBS do better.  This may all seem negative but I did give it 3 stars, its just that compared with the best thing I've ever seen on television, &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, this series seems like just a good effort.  But an effort worth your time.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|you cant go wrong by buying this album it has everything very good energetic songs.This is what rolling stone magazine had to say about this album<br />&quot;Recorded in 1979 in London, which was then wrenched by surging unemployment and drug addiction, and released in America in January 1980, the dawn of an uncertain decade, London Calling is nineteen songs of apocalypse fueled by an unbending faith in rock &amp; roll to beat back the darkness. Produced with no-surrender energy by legendary Sixties studio madman Guy Stevens, the Clash's third album sounds like a free-form radio broadcast from the end of the world, skidding from bleak punk (&quot;London Calling&quot;) to rampaging ska (&quot;Wrong 'Em Boyo&quot;) and disco resignation (&quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot;).The album was made in dire straits, too. The band was heavily in debt; singer-guitarists Joe Strummer and Mick Jones, the Clash's Lennon and McCartney, wrote together in Jones' grandmother's flat, where he was living for lack of dough. But the Clash also cranked up the hope. The album ends with &quot;Train in Vain,&quot; a rousing song of fidelity (originally unlisted on the back cover) that became the sound of triumph: the Clash's first Top Thirty single in the U.S.&quot;<br />.....impressive eh?
B000065U1N|4.0|My husband brought home this movie, and I watched it with him.  It is an EXTREMELY violent war movie, but is the story of a true battle fought by American soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia.  Be sure you enjoy violent movies before getting this film, as there is almost two hours of straight violence.  The battle starts with one soldier actually falling accidentally out of the helicopter, to the ground, instead of his shinnying down the helicopter rope to the ground, as the other soldiers do.  As his comrades try to help get him evacuated, more soldiers get hurt.  As others come to help them, even more get hurt.  This was supposed to be a 45-minute operation, but turned into a 16-hour quagmire, and that is just what the movie feels like as you watch it.  You cannot help but be impressed by the heroism of the soldiers, and of the general, who keeps insisting on \\"getting every last man out.\\"
B00008S2VG|4.0|I have to admit that this CD was not my favorite on first listen. There were songs that I liked. Those songs have now become songs that I love. &quot;American Life&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot; were probably not the smartest choices for singles and not the strongest on the album. The remix of &quot;Hollywood&quot; that Madonna did at the MTV awards was better. I'm not a fan of &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;. So why 4 stars? Because the acoustic based songs on the disc are that great! &quot;Love Profusion&quot; should have been the first single and I don't think being the 4th single it can change the album's fate. It is a beautiful song with a gorgeous video. &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; is a wonderful song, as is &quot;X-Static Process&quot; and &quot;Easy Ride&quot;. They are pretty simple acoustic based songs. My favorite song on the disc is &quot;Intervention&quot;. I just LOVE that song. &quot;Die Another Day&quot; is such an underrated song. My 14yr old sister LOVES that song. Who says Madonna doesn't appeal to the teens! &quot;Mother And Father&quot; gets picked on for silly lyrics but I think she is singing from the point of view of when she was a kid and the little rap in the song makes me think of a child sorta singing it as she was doing hopscotch. I think that's where she was aiming with that. People are just always so willing to write her off. Radio has abandoned her and I am sure MTV will too. So she goes the way of amazing artists like Elton John, Billy Joel, Cher and Tina Turner who don't sell a ton of copies of their new material and don't get much airplay for their new music but can still pack an arena any day of the week. Not a bad place to be really.
B00018D3RI|5.0|It's about time that this great series comes out on DVD. I can't wait for the remaining seasons to come out. I hope that there will more in depth interviews with Paul M. Glaser, David Soul, Antonio Fargas and Bernie Hamilton.<BR>THANKS!
B000002G87|4.0|Before he settled into his longstanding solo career, Eric Clapton drifted through a series of bands.  He cut his professional teeth with The Yardbirds (where he was first called 'slowhand') and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, rose to the top in Cream, briefly placed his hopes in Blind Faith, and after a brief stint with Delaney and Bonnie finally reincarnated himself as Derek of Derek and the Dominos (the name was coined as a facetious moniker for a benefit performance that stuck).  While Clapton's work with Cream is certainly legendary, I believe his career peaked in the early 1970's with this particular recording and live releases under the 'Derek' pseudonym.<br />Much is made of the fact that 'Layla', and perhaps other songs on this disc, were written or chosen for performance as a consequence of Clapton's romance with Patti Boyd, George Harrison's first wife.  Songs like 'Tell the Truth' and 'Bell Bottom Blues' can certainly be interpreted as pertaining to this confused love triangle, which ended with Boyd leaving Harrison to marry Clapton.  Ironically, the Dominos went on to back Harrison on his classic 1971 triple-LP, the first box set, 'All Things Must Pass'.  Lucky for all of us, once the dust had cleared we were left with a stunning legacy of classic compositions and performances.  Unfortuntely for Clapton, he soon succumbed to a heroin addiction that nearly claimed his life, and Harrison succumbed to a Krishna addiction without the shaved head.<br />'Layla and other assorted love songs' is one of the finest productions of the early 1970's.  The album has a bit of everything, from hard-driving rock and roll ('Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad' and 'Layla' which, despite its fame, only rose to number 51 nationally in 1971, perhaps because so many people preferred the longer album version) to classic blues ('Have You Ever Loved a Woman' and 'Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out') to soft ballads ('I Am Yours' and 'It's Too Late'), to consumable pop ('I LookedAway' and 'Bell Bottom Blues').  Add to this such great pure rock songs as 'Anyday', 'Key To the Highway', and 'Tell the Truth', among others, and there isn't much else one could ask for.  There is an abundance of tremendous rock guitar, with Clapton and Duane Allman, who would die in 1971 when he was struck on his motorcycle by a peach truck, trading licks.  Along with Clapton are Bobby Whitlock on organ and vocals, Carl Radle on bass, and Jim Gordon (who played for the Souther, Hillman, Furay Band) on drums.  This was a tight band, in the studio and on tour, and each of these band members hit the high water marks of their careers here.<br />There are a couple lesser cuts, in particular Whitlock's 'Thorn Tree In the Garden' and the cover of the Jimi Hendrix standard 'Little Wing' (it takes a lot of guts to even THINK of covering a Hendrix number).  The only other criticism of the disc might be that in some instances there are better live renditions of certain tracks.  The intensity of Clapton's live performances, such as a blistering 'Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad' on Derek and the Dominos 'In Concert' disc makes the choice difficult, even though Allman isn't featured on any of those recordings.  The choice is a bit easier when one discovers that the 'In Concert' disc is no longer in print, though that condition can't last long.  But the existance of some better versions certainly doesn't make these versions inferior, and only here is this particular amalgam of classic tracks available.  It's a lot of superb music at a very reasonable price.
B000002KIK|1.0|I am sort of going through a revision of BS albums, that I had on tapes and/or vynil long time ago. This one is not among my favorites. There is just too much Ozzy here, and not enough of everybody else. The title track is unremarkable; then the music goes up a bit on tracks 2 and 3, but then it slows down, and until the last track the sound is as boring as if it's Greatful Dead or something. The only thing that's cool about this album is its cover. I am at complete loss, why in most shops this CD is sold for higher price than other BS stuff.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I really don't think the music samples can help you make a decision here. If you are a pop fan, you must give it a try and give it a couple of listens. <BR>I was listening to her first album a couple of days ago and I have to admit, she has improved so much. Her lyrics aren't very amazing or anything in 'In the Zone' but still much better than stuff that went 'I was born to make you happy', 'E-mail my heart' or 'Soda pop'. She sounds so much better too. I do agree her voice isn't very pleasant but I don't think you'll mind it very much on this CD.<BR>There are some great hot sexy numbers in there and worth a try...
B000001FSR|5.0|This was the first Tom Waits Album I heard, and I became an instant fan. His other albums are great, but this is the one I think of when I think of Tom Waits.<BR>An essential to any audio library.<BR>His gritty urban vocals combined with heartfelt emotion and neo-modern Jazz instrumentals make for a very interesting Musical coaster ride. Highly recomended.
B0001AP12G|4.0|The College Dropout is an amazing CD. \\"Jesus Walks\\" \\"Spaceship\\"  \\"Never Let Me Down\\" and \\"Through the Wire\\" are among the most amazing hip-hop tracks I've heard in a while, and the production remains solidly consistent throughout.  Add very solid guest appearances from Consequence, Jay-Z, J. Ivy, Talib Kweli, Common, and Mos Def, and you have a perfect hip-hop album. What keeps it from being the masterpeice that it should be is the fact that there is just way too much filler.  Most of the skits and \\"Last Call\\" are just pointless.<BR>  <BR>The inclusion of this filler over such great tracks such as \\"Home\\" (go to his website to check it out) doesn't make any sense.  Also,  while I understand where he's coming from with his hate for college (he didn't need the establishment to succeed) I don't really agree with him.  <br />All in all, despie its faults, The College Dropout is a great album and everyone who considers themselves a fan of hip-hop should pick it up.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead were at a clearly defined crossroads. Will they stick to their newly explored electronica or return to their rock roots? Well they take the middle road with this one, merging a lot of the bleak and fascinating sounds they've been expiramenting with since Kid A and Amnesiac and merged it with the swirling sounds of OK Computer and the elemental hardness of The Bends. It has made so many lists for top albums of 2003 and I just have to agree with everyone. Whether you are a fan of Radiohead's old ways or prefer their electronica, you'll love this album; if you are an all-out Radiohead fan who likes all their stuff than you'll definetly like this one. Although it takes many listens to get its full impact, as with most of Radiohead's material, it's worth it.
0618002219|5.0|\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is the prequel to his blockbuster hit \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  A must read for anyone who is a LOTR fan like me.  This epic fantasy introduces the world of hobbits in Middle-Earth and one in particular Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.  Bilbo lives comfortably on six meals a day in his hobbit hole under the hill in Bag-End.  Not one to consider himself adventurous Bilbo with the nudging of his friend the Wizard Gandalf the Grey accompanies thirteen dwarves (Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur) on a quest to reclaim their lost treasure from the dragon Smaug in the Lonely Mountain.  Known as the Burglar Bilbo encounters many strange creatures including pony eating goblins, wargs, wolves, giant eagles, wood elves, man eating spiders, a talking dragon and Gollum.<br />While lost in the Misty Mountains, Bilbo finds a golden ring.  To hearing the cries of the creature Gollum he puts the ring in his pocket.  Gollum has lost his precious (the ring).  Upon meeting, Bilbo and Gollum strike a deal.  They will play a riddling game.  If Bilbo wins, Gollum will lead him out of the mountains.  If Gollum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo.  Although Bilbo wins, Gollum has no intention of helping Bilbo when suddenly the ring finds its way to Bilbo's hand and puff...he disappears.  He becomes invisible.  Bilbo uses this ability to escape the Misty Mountains with its goblins and many other pickles he will find himself in throughout the rest of his adventure to Mirkwood, Lake-town and the Lonely Mountain.<br />Although this is a fantasy novel, it is not necessarily appropriate for small children.  It is more for adults, teenagers and older children.
0897500482|3.0|This book was never actually written by Bruce for book form. This is a compilation of his notes and drawings. While this creates somewhat of a jumbled reading experience, Tao of Jeet Kune Do is still an interesting insight to how progressive Bruce Lee was for his time. What he created, which was carried on by Joe Lewis in the ring, was a practical, functional method of fighting that inspires martial artists to this day.
B000003TA4|5.0|This cd is true grunge music.It has many great songs on it.It is one of the best CD's Nirvana has ever made.It is still a great cd even after MTV played songs from the CD over and over again.Don't listen to Afi k. James they don't know what good music really is
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I've been a Neil Young fan for years.  Despite all the bad reviews I decided to go see him at Radio City with the hope of seeing and hearing some classics after he finished the Greendale portion of the show.  Although I didn't enjoy the monologues between songs off the Greendale album, I thought the music was classic Neil Young.  I don't know about 18 March show but most people stayed to the end.  And most seemed very glad that they did when he played My, My, Hey, Hey (Out of the Blue), a cover of All Along the Warchtower, and Powderfinger.  In the end I'd have to say I was pleasantly suprised with the show includingthe Greendale portion.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love Evanescence. Amy Lee's vocals are amazing and her lyrics are all so meaningful and powerful. Plus their live performances sound great as well. My favourite tracks are Going Under, Bring Me to Life, Everybody's Fool and My Immortal. It's a great overall CD, especially for their first.
B00004XMS0|3.0|Whats there to say about these four movies? Plenty!<br />The first Batman stars \\"Michael Keaton\\" as Bruce Wayne A.K.A\\"Batman\\" and Jack Nicolson as \\"The Joker\\" the plot evolves from the major crime boss of Gothem played by Jack Palance gets a little upset to find out one of his men is having an affair with his girl! So he sets him up to be captured by the police, only to have that man be accidently tossed over a rail into a batch of toxis waste and thought to be dead! But he's not, after he recovers and has some surgery he has become a new man, and calls himself \\"The Joker\\" and he takes over as the new crime boss of Gothem, and beeing ruthless he has sent out a mysterious virus that is killing people off slowly and Batman comes along to save the day, along the way there action, explosions , new gadgets and some cool effects! Kim Bassinger plays the leading lady and this movie is worth watching, its the best of what came out of these four movie....the first may not be the original, but its the original to this series of the Batman saga, and its the best of these four! <br />Batman returns has had alot of mixxed reviews. some like it, some dont! Me personally I dont think its a great movie! Batmans back and this time he has a new villian to deal with, a man who was abandend by his parents almost after birth and has been living in the seweres since .... and when he emerges he has become the golden boy of gothem, suckering people into making him beleive hes a good guy. That man is the Penguin played by Danny Devito! Batman knows he's dirty and sets out to proove it! Also Michelle Pheifer plays the Catwoman, many i think liked the film because of seeing her in a tight costume, seeing as how sex doesnt sell in my book, it may be why i dont see this film as beeing any good! Also stars \\"Christpher Walkin\\" he plays a wealthy buisness man who is not a nice man, and with such scum running around gothem, Batman is there to try and save the day once again from the crime around gothem!<br />Batman Forever I would bet money on is in any ones top 10 worst movies of all time list! This movie starred a new leading man for Batman \\"Val Kilmer\\" as Batman and also bringing in the new villians of The Riddler (Jim Carey) and Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the new leading lady is played by barf girl (Nicole Kidman) even with a cast like that this movie failed! Its plot is bad, the whole serisness and almost beleiable first two movies have just completly taken a 180 turn and gone into a stupid comic book looking city with some of THE worst acting of all time! The only actor who played a decent role was the other new comer to the series Robin (Chris O'donnel)<br />Batman & Robin introduces \\"George Clooney\\" as Batman, Chris O'donnel returns as Robin, and introduces Alicia Silverstone to play Bat Girl.... two new villians have emerged in Gothem , Mr.Freeze (Arnold Shwartzenegger) and Posion Ivy (Uma Thermon) this movie was a bit better then the last one, but Arnolds acting is by far some of his worst! And Uma's parading around in tights trying to sell a sexy image does not do it for me! George Clooney IMO did not play that bad a role as Batman, he is certinlly better then Val Kilmer, but no where near as good as Keaton!<br />Final Advice on these movies<BR>1 - Good, well worth watching ***** five stars!<BR>2 - Eh, wasnt as good as the first **** four stars<BR>3 - ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! / Zero Stars<BR>4 - An improvment on the last, but not good enough *** 3 stars!<br />My advice is to buy only the first one and maybe the second one if you liked it! But if you buy Batman Forever, you will make one of the worst purchases of all time! You will regret it! And the 4th isnt really worth having...if you get a great deal on all four, then go for it, but IMO part one and two is the only ones worth getting!<br />The worst downfall to ALL of these movies, is not one of them comes with any bonus features!!!! I remember heaps of stuff that was around whenall 4 of these films where made, starting with the trailer to the first movie \\"a man in black\\" and its very disapointing that they neglect some of the biggest movies of all time like this!
