B0076DCT2G|2.0|Interesting info about Yemen but moved too slowly<br />John Corey humor was good for about 1/3 of the book then tedious
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Not a bad game just wish I had more options with the horse. More options with the horse would make the game more intresting . How about some hands on activities with the horse?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I stayed up past midnight playing this game, put it way to go to sleep but had to get it back out again.  It's great.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was and always will be the best book u have ever made. Can't wait for the next book so excited
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had not seen this show before I saw it on Amazon - now I'm hooked and need to see the entire series.
B003MC5N28|5.0|The giver was a beautifully written book! It was a very enjoyable book. I enjoyed the last few chapters because it had my favorite characters,gabe, the give,and Jonas.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Great and fun game!<br />Recommend it highly- surprised that it is this good on a tablet<br />Get it and you won't regret it-
B008P3SPVU|5.0|It was not the routine of the underdog rising to the top to win it all.  It was a great movie showing what discipline can do.
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|Ok so this might be controversial based on other reviews I've read but I really thought this was a great book. I thought the story was well written and you can understand why Miss Harris ended it the way she did and also why a lot of people aren't happy about it. However I feel she remained trus to Sookie as a character and I can't wait for the “Epilouge&#34; to come out at the end of this year. You'll have to read if yourself to make up your own mind!
0425263924|5.0|Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia...how do you do it!?  You have managed to turn me into a page turning, head in my book, don't-ask-me-for-anything-while-I'm-reading Woman!  Have already done the Shades Trilogy, I was at first a little disappointed by how similar your story was with Shades.  You have since, however, broken out on your own with a very great story about these two tortured souls: Eva and Gideon (love the names by the way).  I had to pace myself with Entwined.  I read early on from some of the commentary that there would be a \\"Book 4\\", so I figured the story would be left hanging somewhere - but I just couldn't figure out where as the tale kept getting more and more intense.  Can you please give me a light at the end of the tunnel and tell me when Book 4 will be released!?
B009CG29RK|5.0|Very touching film about the way that becoming a parent inebitably changes your priorities, and the power that children have to help us be our very best selves.
B0031QVW2U|1.0|I shoot with a Nikon D7000 with the MB-D11 battery grip always attached.  Have used the Black Rapid RS-7 for over a year and generally like it, and have now added the Brad to keep everything in place better.  The Brad *does* help keep the Black Rapid strap from travelling/rotating over the shoulder - and here lies the problem.  If I try to rotate to portrait position (99% of my shots), the viewfinder won't reach eye-level.  WITHOUT the Brad, the strap allowed \\"wiggle\\" room (i.e. it lifted off the shoulder) enough to get the camera eye-level while in portrait orientation.  WITH the Brad, the strap is locked to the shoulder - no wiggle room - and the camera no longer reaches eye-level in portrait orientation.<br /><br />If you watch the Brad install videos from Black Rapid (there are 2 on Yootoob), you'll notice they never demonstrate shooting in portrait orientation.  Hmmm...<br /><br />Obviously, I just lengthened my RS-7 strap another 3 or 4 inches which helped get the extra length I needed to get in to portrait orientation.  But what this does is lower the height where the camera hangs.  It's now below the ideal height I originally and carefully set which should be small-of-back/top of hip level and will be more prone to bouncing off of my leg.  This is a pretty poor trade-off for portrait orientation.<br /><br />As last resort, I may put my strap back to its original, ideal length and use the Brad only while walking about - then unclip the Brad's buckle when I actually start shooting.  Again, not a great trade-off but probably better than lengthening the strap.<br /><br />Alas, the Brad is not a perfect solution - a fussy one at best.  Time will tell if I keep it on.  At least it was fairly inexpensive...<br /><br />UPDATE 8/30/2013<br /><br />I tried to like the Brad, but finally removed it yesterday.  The 2 weaknesses:  1) it locks the strap to your shoulder which actually reduces the range of motion available to position the camera at eye level, especially inportrait position; 2) to compensate for the 1st weakness, you must lengthen the camera strap, which results in the camera banging against your upper leg.  Dropping my rating from 2-star to 1-star...
B00006LJ6X|4.0|As far as I'm concerned the only decent song from Chicago that Peter Cetera sang lead on was &#34;25 or 6 to 4&#34;.  They were such a good rock band, that deteriorated into a Holiday Inn lounge band.  But, I love Terry Kath's &#34;Byblos&#34; on this release and there are many great moments.  Of course there are also the sappy Top 40 hits from Cetera and Lamm, that would come to mark the future of the band, but all in all, this is a great rock/jazz album.  So, if you like that side of Chicago, then pick this one up.  But, starting with Chicago VIII, the Holiday Inn lounge band really starts to take over.
0739341243|4.0|I enjoyed this book, and always prefer listening on tape than reading as I drive quite a bit. It only lacked any real advice and focused on the facts ...which as an introvert I kinda already know :-)
B003L5BRXK|5.0|I have always been partial to &#34;Sticky Fingers&#34; as the Rolling Stones best album, but the older I get, and the more I listen to &#34;Exile On Main Street&#34; the more I realize that it may indeed be their best.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|One of her best. The Forgotten Garden is still my favorite but this one was excellent.. Interesting characters coping with the changes that occurred during that era.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I caught the first episode on TV and couldn't stop watching. Luckily for me, they were running 2 episodes each week. I was hooked immediately. Love the cast and story line is awesome. After three weeks of this I couldn't wait for the next episode so I ordered the complete set. Love,love,love it. It was put together extremely well and would have to be to catch me...I highly recommend this set for anyone that is a Battlestar fan.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I have read many of her books and this is one of her best. It is an interesting interpretation of a very controversial historical event.
B00CATSONE|3.0|If you know much about Tesla--don't bother with this book.  99% of it you know already and the rest isn't that important.  However, if you don't know Tesla, this is a great introduction to one of the most interesting and brilliant men in modern history.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|It was an ok book. I didn't know it was a memoir when I purchased it. I usually don't do memoirs.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|This was ok, but I saw it the first few times as Underworld or Van Helsing. It's not tiring to watch but I've seen the genre so many times before.
B007T99ENE|3.0|I really enjoy reading Ian McEwan and this book was no exception. However the plot seems to rely heavily on sexual scenes and emotional interactions in order to add weight to the importance of certain events. The overall impression is that it gets bogged down when it could be racing along.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|A good game - a  lot of fun to play.  The graphics are good.  The only thing I don't particularly like is the way the people look when they are building their city - very unnatural looking.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Wow, what a great musician!  Has many other musicians with him that play many other instruments as well.  Blues, Blue Grass, some TexMex, fun, deep, wonderful!  And a great voice as well.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|I had an older version of this game on my phone and it included info about each city between the rounds and had a hidden object segment as well.  Now it's just screen after screen of match 3, a lame trace a design to activate the element and place the items found into the correct portion of a picture.<br /><br />Had I known it had been changed for, in my opinion, the worse I never would have bought it.  The puzzles they removed broke up the match 3 nicely.  These were replaced by very simplistic puzzles that do nothing to hold my interest.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed Playrix games and have many, including the original of this one, on my PC.  I tend to expect more from Playrix and this time I feel really let down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game needs you to be able to spawn baby animals and make them stay baby's. Otherwise I think it is great game!!!!!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great utility for finding those hidden features of the Kindle Fire. I would highly recommend this utility.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book. Everytime I thought I had figured out what was going on the plot twisted a little more. I couldn't put this book down because I just had to know what would happen next.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The compassion Ana feels for Christian is profound! She sees past all the issues to find unconditional love. Master may be dark but he will see the light!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|On every level, this is a wonderful narrative of an ordinary man who decides to get out of his own skin and journey on foot to see a woman he admired long ago, as she is dying of cancer.  The effort he makes is palatable.  The life lessons along the way draws the reader in. His wife, as she tries to understand this unfamiliar behavior from her spouse, is a journey of sorts too.  I don't want to give this gem of a story away but it's a book I could easily read right over again.  Really nice.
B000M53GM2|5.0|The movie Goldeneye first came out in 1995 when I was just turning 13 that year.  So of course I enjoy the action scenes, great gun shooting scenes, and the tank going threw town driven by Bond.  Brosnan in my view does an amazing job as the character \\"Bond, James Bond\\".  I also like the fight scenes plus mutiple stunt work on the movie, I am trying to go threw the Bond movies to play caught up for the new installments Bond 24 and Bond 25 with Craig.  But back to Goldeneye if your looking for a great Bond flick with good acting by a good actor pick this movie up for the action, acting, mind blowing special effects, good plot, and hot women.  It is truly one of best or better Bond movies they ever had pleasure of making, I can tell why he did four Bond movies can be addicting.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This has got to be one of the funniest book I've read in a very long time!!!! OMG is all I can say!!! Loved loved loved it!!!!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is one of the best yarns that has ever spun on a screen. The story is tremendous. The language would make a sailor blush. There is no need for this much foul language. Without the foul language, this film should go down in history as one of the very, very best ever made.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|These guys are the most talented singers I have ever heard and  I have bough every one of their albums.
B00CFYD682|4.0|Like others, I will affirm my loyalty to Alison going back to my purchase of \\"Upstairs at Eric's\\" in 1982.  Many of the reviews in the press have said this is her \\"best album in decades,\\" but I don't think they have been following Alison very closely.  \\"Essex\\" and \\"Hometime,\\" in my opinion, are superior to this album.  That doesn't mean it isn't very good--she just sets a high standard for herself.  Sometimes Sigsworth's electronica suits the material--especially on \\"Filigree\\" and \\"Right as Rain.\\"  In other places it seems at odds with the song.  In any case, Alison's voice sounds as glorious as ever--she seems even to have strengthened it in her upper register.  Overall, a very satisfying CD.  It does make me long for another collaboration with Vince Clarke, though, whose arrangements for Alison's voice were always so remarkable.
1612680011|4.0|I initially borrowed the book from my local library. I then decided to buy it because I thought that it would be a great book to share with my children and to have around as a reference.<br /><br />The book opens your mind to the issue of financial education and if only for that it is worth reading it. Mr. Kiyosaki asserts that schools fail to educate us about money resulting in people trained to be good employees but poor businessman and poor investors.<br /><br />My only concern is that it reads like a long infomercial for the author's CASHFLOW game which is incessantly mentioned. The chapters are broken into tiny little sections, some less than a page long, so the message is rather disjointed. It clearly was not meant for the literary set. Mr. Kiyosaki is also a bit weak on real life examples, only here and there mentioning some of his successes and failures but fail to turn it into a more effective messages.<br /><br />Nonetheless, as a trained engineer from an Ivy League university, I wholeheartedly agreed with Mr. Kiyosaki's message. So I decided to buy The History of Money to start filing in the missing info. Mr. Kiyosaki was my first step in that journey and it surely helped me. Enjoy!
B003M6EAXM|5.0|There is not too much to say, but only this is &#34;THE BEST OF THE BEST TV SERIES&#34; for a long time
1781162646|4.0|As always, enjoyed S. King's book.  Somewhat different for him, but was good read. Have all his books in hard cover (or soft cover) and keep them on hand to re-read.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is the reason I watch movies!<br />Like Rocky said, \\"What's the attraction? She fills gaps. She's got gaps, I got gaps, together we fill gaps\\"[[ASIN:B00A81MV3U Silver Linings Playbook]]
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This portable external battery saves my life everyday! I bought it because the battery on my iPhone 4 wasn't lasting even a full day. My Anker is small enough to fit in my pocket or my purse and I carry with me everywhere I go. I have used it to charge my camera and other people's dead phones. It comes with all the connectors I need. Awesome product! :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keeps my brain busy... love it, need more!!! Please, pretty please...they said if i rated i will get more levels
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love the series, can't wait for season 4.  Love to watch these back to back with the family instead of viewing it weekly.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|Could be. The storyline is super interesting, the acting is top notch, the music score is great, and the cinematography outstanding. The suspense is palpable, and there is also just enough humor to please the senses (Hitchcocks most enjoyable movies use this formula, starting with \\"The 39 Steps\\" in the 1930s, in my opinion). I don't know about you, but I find no fun in his movies \\"The Birds\\", \\"Strangers on a Train\\", \\"Psycho\\", \\"Vertigo\\" and some of his other so-called \\"Hitchcockian thrillers\\". My favorites: this movie, of course, \\"The 39 Steps\\", \\"The Lady Vanishes\\", \\"Rebecca\\" (how'd that get in here?), \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" (the second version with Jimmy Stewart, although the 1930s B&W one is good too), \\"To Catch a Thief\\", \\"Notorious\\", \\"Spellbound\\", \\"Rear Window\\" , and \\"Dial M for Murder\\". Just my thoughts.<br /><br />HD version is very clear, good colors, excellent sound. No problems with streaming.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Very good movie.  As always I love the eastwood.  I Recommend.  I Love the baseball movies. Go on ahead and rent it.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|20 years later, and Braveheart still draws out all the feelings: passion, fear, sorrow, empathy... You feel like you're a part of history and embrace each character (even Longshanks) with familial love or disdain!<br />Always a good way to spend a night....
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Great period piece with scenery, cars and fashion of the era. Acting was outstanding. It brought back a lot of memories of my childhood years growing up in the rural south.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|it was the best game I ever played it makes me really brave when I play the game but it is really really awesome
B009K0P10K|5.0|Loved it. My DVR went out on me and I lost all of the Episodes I had recorded so I downloaded them to my kindle and watced them there.
B001NTCSCK|5.0|&#34;Tease Me, Please Me&#34; gets things going, I imagine getting into a McLaren P1 and hitting the pedal would be a good analogy.<br />The energy never wavers; they run the gamut from the title song to the beautifully rendered &#34;Winds Of Change&#34;, which showcase their versatility.<br />I know this is to be a review of the cd, but I want to say something about Scorpions live and how it relates to their recordings.<br />They are my favorite group for a variety of reasons: Powerful, melodious, energetic, and dynamic. The interplay between lead singer Klaus Meine and guitarists Rudolf Schenker and Matthias Jabs is wonderful. Running around the stage like a bunch of twentysomethings is greatly entertaining. The dynamism and energy of a live Scorpions performance is faithfully rendered in &#34;Crazy World&#34;. Crank your home system up, sit in the sweet spot and enjoy! Well worth the ride!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it is easy to operate and does exactly what it is suppose to do..  it wakes me up. great App
B000TU16GS|4.0|Great if you are in to action and crime fighting. Lots of shooting, bombs, etc. But it's a great book series starter.#HFISH
1576875776|5.0|This excellently printed presentation of just a few dozen of the 100,000 negatives left by this late genius street photographer gives a taste of what is yet to come. The selection includes self-portraits, children, social dropouts, buildings and street scenes. Mundane subjects, but every print a gem of composition and lighting.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is totally awesome! Some things you have to use gems to by but I just save my gems until I can buy It.people who submit  bad reviews obviously dont listen to what their saying if your gems go down fast that means STOP USING THEM!!! You caget tons of neighbors like me I have 164..so If your reading this dont listen to bad reviews because they dont know  what their talking about.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought it was really a love story.  Boy is screwed due to his childhood, meets sweet girl who becomes his true therapist.  Brings him into the real world, even though he is afraid and vulnerable.<br />Upshot is happily ever after.  I read it twice and loved it each time, despite all the sex, which was really hot!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have enjoyed every one of the books in this series.  Harris has a great imagination and has shown her strong writing talent in the way her characters are developed and the clarity of her story line.  I am always excited when starting one of her books.
B0053ZOQMK|4.0|Excellent animation! Johnny Depp as the voice of Rango is excellent and as quirky as ever. Recommend watching in HD.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely LOVE pinterest! I go on all the time and love looking at ideas. Fantastic for athletes who like to look for workouts- which is what I mainly use it for. overall I love it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The higher you get the more levels you get.  Then you get 2 worlds.  Man the game keeps going and going.  It is so much fun.  I got Grandma hooked on it. hahaha  Watching her play it is the best.
0843135697|5.0|My children loved these books when they were young, and I'm now buying them for my grandchildren.  They have already put in the wish list for the next ones.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|This game is ok but not great.  You have to play on Face book.  Rovio has much better games.  But because it was free I can not complain too much.  It is ok, but I thought  friends meant the charaters you get to play with not FB friends.
B0074PNCRM|4.0|I spent a whole night at a family get together hearing praise of this book and recieving imperitive orders to read it. I got home, bought the book on my kindle and was quite frankly disappointed. It's a good book, don't get me wrong. But It is not nearly as good as what everyone has built it up to be.<br />Maybe it's just because I don't do cancer books.<br />But it has it's funny times, it's sad times and all in all it's not too shabby a story. And for a bloke John Green writes a 16 year old female accuratly well!<br />I think the only way to know whether you like or do not like this book is to read it. It's just one of those reads where you never know what it'll inspire in you until you're reading that concluding page.
B00CBKLO52|1.0|boring boring boring boring boring boring.  I did not like it.  It is not FREE you have to pay for the planes.  Heli.  and boats.  Don't load it unless you are willing to spend 1.00 on each plane, heli and boat EACH.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this story.  Both characters are troubled and have a lot of psychological issues.  Even though I think they make a perfect match I think they will need lots of therapy before either of them can truly love each other.  I am reading book 2 now.  Recommend reading this series in order.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Love it ....  So fun.  So many levels.  So many bombs. so many dinosaurs.  so much fun.  My kids love it.  I love it.  So many teleports ...  so much candy to eat.  He is SO CUTE when he is dressed up.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I love David Baldacci's books.  Hope to read all that he has written. Kept in suspense through out. the book.

B00C7JGDBW|5.0|My kids say the this is the best movie ever.  they want to see Oz II now.  There is not an Oz 2, but they still want the movie to continue all the way to the original Dorothy movie.  Which they love.

B00138KE5Y|5.0|Politics aside, this is a great album. Wish she would concentrate on her music because her views had turned me off. Still a great voice.
B007EECSFA|3.0|This was our book club book.  I found that this book having too much detail and not enough dedicated to the story.  Kate Morton did a great deal of discovery concerning her subject.
B0011Z78R6|5.0|You can't say enough about a group like The Eagles. Everything they do is pure gold that doesn't tarnish with age.
B0026977EK|3.0|I sat through this because a friend was interested in seeing it, but 'sat through' was the keyword. Narration seemed to be used to move the story forward vs a decent plot; this made it feel artificial and pasted together.<br /><br />That said, the movie is worthwhile to see just for Penelope Cruz, who together with Javier Bardem, is the best part of the movie. She showed real commitment to her role in spite of the weak story, and was highly entertaining to watch. Her chemistry with Bardem was apparent as well. Scarlett Johanssen was a weak link aside from the narration gimmick, her performance to me feeling like she wasn't getting the character, who was supposed to be a flighty, bohemian dilettante sort. She comes across as too grounded and confident to be the person she was portraying.<br /><br />But again, worthwhile for Cruz and Bardem.
B004H1TBU8|3.0|Auster uses a lot of catch phrases that were common in the 20's in the US. Very hard for non-english person
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the app.--it's nice to be able to check the weather anytime you need it.  Also the radar aspect is great.  Would reccommend.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Have to say that I'm a little glad that this series is over. It's been slowing going downhill for me--the books are still entertaining, but just getting a little far fetched  with each one that comes out.<br /><br />I was sad to see the ending, even though you can kind of see the author had been setting it up this way. *Spoiler* Just like the Joker famously said &#34;an unstoppable force meets an immovable object&#34;, Sookie and Eric are both just too stubborn for their relationship to last. I'm content with the way it ended.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I just saw the movie twice and it keeps getting better. Despite being a story very well known by all, is quite fresh and full of surprises, with great actors and great performances just like any film made it for criterion people, with emotions transmitted to all the audience, making you believe again in films that aren´t dummies and full of nonsense action for be a Superhero movie. It makes it honors to Christopher Nolan´s work, which I admire so much and all that he write and produce. The directing of Snyder was superb and exceed all my expectations. What else can you ask for this movie ?, maybe only that the saga continue and hope not to wait too much for the second chapter.
1481207474|3.0|Cut to the Chase:<br />It pains me to put a 3 star rating on a Courtney Milan novel, as I am really, really a fan of her writing -- normally she creates clear, clever, multilayered characters in a richly constructed drama. The characters makes me swoon and cry... sometimes all at once. But... this particular effort, while still very, very readable, doesn't shine quite as brightly for me as Milan's other works. While all of the side characters are richly drawn... they're SO convincing and interesting that you almost lose interest in the main characters (especially our hero, who feels curiously muted). I still enjoyed the novel (hence 3 stars), but compared to other Milan novels, it just doesn't feel up to snuff.<br /><br />Greater Detail:<br />Our heroine is a woman with a past (and not a past where she had a lover, or was caught kissing someone, or even was born on the wrong side of the sheets). Though I won't give it away completely, I'll tell you what's hinted at fairly early on:  Minne (who now goes by the name Wilheminia Pursling instead of Miss Minerva Lane) spent the first 12 years of her life pretending to be a boy.<br /><br />These days, she's afraid of crowds, afraid of being noticed, and afraid of anyone finding out about her past. Though she pictures herself as a tea kettle, almost ready to boil but never allowed to let off any steam, she folds into herself, and pretends to be lesser, smaller, and more boring than all those around her, so that she can escape attention.<br /><br />Through a handbill (unions, strikes, political contretemps), she is inextricably tied to Robert Blaisdell, the current Duke of Clermont. He's rich, handsome, and seems completely beyond her touch... except he is, of course, completely intrigued by Minnie, believing that she is the one person who looks beyond his pedigree.<br /><br />Argh. It's going to be hard for me to articulate my frustration with this novel -- on the one hand, there are some really amazing scenes and wonderfully worked dialogue/puns/etc (there are some wickedly entertaining paste puns as well as a discussion about cats and what cats pretend to do that makes reading the rest of the book seem entirely worthwhile). There are some GREAT side characters (the friend Lydia, the cousin Sebastian, the friend Violet, even the awful/not awful soon-to-be-dowager duchess). And... maybe that's the real problem here. There are so many interesting characters and side plots (because this is VERY clearly the book that starts the trilogy... or however many books there will be in this series...) that we lose sight of the main characters. They seem duller than those around them. Robert, our duke, is so insecure and wrapped up in his tragic childhood that he seems... weak. (And yes, his childhood is a sad one, but he spends so much time thinking about it that I started wondering if he'd benefit more from a therapist than a wife... ) His embarrassment at his friends' banter seems contrived, and he just... well, he's just not that interesting at the end of the day.<br /><br />And Minnie... because she's got this past and this disguise and she struggles with whether or not to be more like how she was, or more like the wallflower she's supposed to be, the character ends up not coming together as a coherent whole.<br /><br />Which is frustrating, because there are some WONDERFUL scenes in this... but they're really, really burdened by uneven pacing, side characters who overwhelm the main characters, and plot climaxes that are a little more meh than usual.<br /><br />It's still, overall, a good book, but far from her best, and barely gets the recommend.<br /><br />Comparisons to Other Authors:<br />The fully fleshed out characters make me think of the better of Lisa Kleypas's, Julia Quinn's or Sherry Thomas's works. Milan has a heck of a vocabulary on her, and everything is just very smoothly written (like Lisa Kleypas in terms of well drawn characters, but a little less hit-me-with-a-thesaurus than Sherry Thomas). Sensuality-wise, she's definitely below Stephanie Laurens and probably more similar to Julia Quinn. Humor-wise, I'd say she's somewhere along the lines of a Tessa Dare (but a little more serious). And drama-wise, she has setups that remind me of Kat Martin or Amanda Quick, but these resolve in a less-dramatic-and-more-believably layered way. My favorite is still Unclaimed, followed by Unveiled and Unraveled. The only Milan I would avoid is probably Unlocked (another novella, and not as good of one).<br /><br />for more reviews... booknosh.com :)an Sherry Thomas). Sensuality-wise, she's definitely below Stephanie Laurens and probably more similar to Julia Quinn. Humor-wise, I'd say she's somewhere along the lines of a Tessa Dare (but a little more serious). And drama-wise, she has setups that remind me of Kat Martin or Amanda Quick, but these resolve in a less-dramatic-and-more-believably layered way. My favorite is still Unclaimed, followed by Unveiled and Unraveled. The only Milan I would avoid is probably Unlocked (another novella, and not as good of one).<br /><br />for more reviews... booknosh.com :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|Tried many apps for my Kindle, this is perfect for my needs.  Easy navigation cleanly displays what I want to see. Thank you. :)
B00BKRON5K|5.0|This book is not the normal style of 'diet' book.  In fact (ignoring the title) it's not about dieting in the normal expected sense - it's about a diet that is based on science and fact - one that is about taking small steps at a time to change your eating habits - it's not about calorie control or things that make you turn off after a week - it's about making it manageable for you. It's a KISS diet changer - I love the way there are stages to adapting to a new way of eating.<br />Key features:<br />- very easy to read<br />- lots of interesting facts about the past and how it's influenced societies take on food today<br />- plain talking<br />- easy ideas<br />- stages to changes not dictorial<br /><br />Highly recommend to all
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|The book was an okay read.  One of the reasons I enjoyed it was because of my French heritage; however, I thought the writing was a little shallow.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out, loved it.  I just returned from London with my family and want them to see it too. Excellent acting job by all.
B008CRC506|5.0|Smash is one of NBC's great hits of the past two season.<br />Why?<br />The actings, singing, and dancing.<br />The music is Broadway's best.<br /><br />They should turn Smash into a play.  I want tickets.<br />Cannot wait for season III
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Makes you think out of the box! Wish it was just a little bit longer. Can't wait for more Room action!!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|Exactly what I was looking for. Love that I can have the kindle propped in portrait mode for reading at my desk while at work. Auto sleep/wake function works great. Only thing I have to complain about is it does add bulk and makes the kindle heavy but that's to be expected with a full multi function case. Overall it's an awesome case and if you can get it on sale like I did even better!
0811879542|5.0|This book is simple, easy to read and is extremely fun. It creates an interactive reading experience in the most creative way. The whole time you are learning colors and do not realize it. Very creative!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|7 year old loves dinosaurs and their movies.  Downloaded this game immediately after finding it.  Son loved, loved playing it with his dad and opening up all of the park stuff.  Even gave me real money from his birthday for me to purchase some dollars to buy dino dollars.  Played and played and having the time of his life for several months.  All of a sudden it wasn't there when he went to evolve a dinosaur!!  Downloaded again to find out all of his and dad's hard work down the drain.  Everything lost!  What a disappointment to him.  Tears are not the best thing for a little boy that isn't prone to them!  Thanks for that inventors.  Please, free or not, your inventions have an effect on people so get more of the bugs out and don't be so greedy with the advancement of levels for these games.  These are after all just games, except to the children and their mothers wiping their tears!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am very much a fan of yours! I loved the first two books! I was completely hooked from the beginning! I loved Eva and Gideon's love story! But this third book felt like different characters. It felt like it didn't start where it left off from book two! What happened to Gideon being in control? When did Eva become so whiney? What happened to Gideon's problems and family which was hardly dealt with? I was ready for a happy ending and closure from there problems! Sick if Corinne or other woman and Brett being an issue!!! If they loved each other as we think than they would quit making stupid decisions and wasting time with these exes!! Please make third book a happy ending to remember! I love these characters but this 3rd book didn't come close to my expectations!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is great. I'm addicted to this game. It kind of reminds me of Mario brothers. I would recommend this game.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I'm not sure if I just had high expectations but this book was a bit drawn out. Sme scenes and characters were unnecessary.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is the best way to talk to your friends quickly and faster, then texting. I would definitely recommend that you would want to<br />get this app. It's the best!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A very fun game! If you like a good challenge this is the game for you! Kind of like playing a detective to find all the clues, you will want to pull your hair out sometimes though lol
B000R4SMD6|5.0|From the get-go one knew who shot the lady.  The cops even had a confession,  but once in court  the trial blows wide open.  This movie is Anthony Hopkins at his best.  He plays this cat-and mouse game with the prosecutor which resulted in an acquittal.  Little by little the prosecutor realizes this case is anything but a slam-dunk.  You will watch this movie more than once.
B001OMJGD0|2.0|I have not able to watch the movie at all, the internet connection that I have is very good so......
B00C061I3K|3.0|I ordered this twice now from Amazon, and twice it did not come? Is this GoHastings I am dealing with here? Customer service kinda sucks at the big A it would seem. \\"Send all the wrong things we sent you back, and we will try to send you another one.\\" Last time I checked I did not work for Amazon... oh, I see the check is in the mail.<br /><br />I'll go to town and buy this, and report back if the CD is to my liking or not. I am pretty sure that the BIG A is not.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love this app I find the percentage always avail and I know when my fire is going to run out on me helps me decide when to charge and how long I need to charge
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|The movie is filled with long car chases,countless shootings<br />and little sense.<br />The plot is predictable and trite.<br />The movie would appeal to people who like<br />to watch violence on screen.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Buy this album. You'll be happy you did. It makes my days easier and my nights longer. Also makes the ladies happy.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I rarely find myself laughing out loud at movies, especially when watching at home. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost make loving references to the movies they grew up with throughout this film. Kudos to Sigourney Weaver for her wonderful sense of humor in this send up of the aliens amongst us genre.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Unable to rotate pieces some would not move about screen. Unable to see pieces on rt side holding area.  Not well constructed.
B005MMZ63C|4.0|I'd seen it before, years and years ago, but never in the HD version of course before now. In watching it again, I can see more later directors who copied for it or perhaps made homage to it in their work.
B0045MPPJK|5.0|I have all Die Antwoord albums on rotation in my music player for 2 months now. it is that good.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Good casting and special effects helped make this a reasonably entertaining film.<br /><br />I wasn't a reader of the comic, but it was fun enough (and free through Amazon Prime).<br />It was good, if predictable, fun.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|for Xfinity to download Season 1 and was not willing to start with Season 2.  So, was glad to be able to get the entire Season 1 and get underway!!!  Fabulous.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Really enjoyed this sequel to the original &#34;Cars&#34;.  What even better is the smile on my grandson's face as he sat on my lap watching the movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love it.  Please buy it.  And the best part is its free.  love it please buy. IT IS CRAZY.watch the trailer.
B0026GBIB6|4.0|Definitely not the strongest album, glad to see Delta Machine improvement, but as DM fan, gotta have them all:) Something different for the road
B009UX2YAC|2.0|It's terrible. I can't even update the app on my kindle Fire. It took 6 TIMES in order to even Wright this review. There might be a glitch in this game .<br />The prices are also really expensive. I mean, 120,000 coins for a character to be. What a rip off. make it easier to get coins and then my review stars might go up.
B0096YJDNQ|2.0|Beautiful app with extremely useful content organized in excellent way. Deserving A+ for that part but C- to D for the one fundamental catastrophic design failure that makes all the content unreachable where it is the most likely to be used: outside of internet connection range. There is absolutely no reason to require internet connection for the most of the functionality of this app. Hence there is absolutely no excuse for this paid-for, not ad-supported app to require internet connection to work. Particularly with likely usage scenario deep in the woods/mountains/.... wherever light pollution have not reached (which usually correlates with no internet service).
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It froze once or twice but the gameplay the story and the authenticity help me look over the crashes and glitches which there are only a few and small ones at that
B001MSMUH0|3.0|I heard Sir Ken Robinson speak recently, and he's an excellent speaker and story teller. Perhaps I expected too much from the book. By in large, the points in the book are not new, and some of his conclusions are hyperbole. How does one's &#34;element&#34; differ from one's &#34;calling&#34; or &#34;vocation&#34; (in the classic sense)? Does everybody have a passion and special skill deep within them? Many do; but many seem not to. Do schools have a responsibility to help students discover their passion? It's great when it happens, but I think a school's basic mission is more modest than that. The very memorable personalities he uses as examples are, in my opinion, &#34;prodigies.&#34; There have always been and always will be prodigies, and such people generally persevere whether or not they are supported. Is this new information?  I have enjoyed reading the book. Many of the biographical sketches are interesting. And it has made me think a little bit about the central issues he raises. But I would have preferred a more concise publication. Less than midway though the book, I found myself thinking, &#34;All right, all right. I get the point. Let's move on,&#34; So, I give this book a moderate recommendation,
B001XUPH9K|3.0|It was just ok when I saw it in the theatre 30 years ago and its just ok today. Rented it so my son could compare it to Star Trek Into Darkness.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you like period settings, you'll get hooked to this series...can't wait for the next season.....easy purchase, click and watch!
B00BHAT5UI|1.0|I tried the book but bored out after a couple of hundred pages. I thought the videos were better for the first season but this is getting incredibly slow. Nothing ever happens, just more and more speeches by people with funny sort of Scottish sounding accents.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just kept going after getting hooked from season 1. The only gripe with is was that I don't agree with the plot change in the finale. Too shocking for fans, I'm still recovering from it...
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|It's really a cinematic score that's done so well. I love listening to this when working on detailed projects for hours. I also finally saw the film and the cinematography matches this score. If you liked Tron Legacy or Inception (which I did), then you'll dig this sound track.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|It's was great! Viewable immediately after purchase. Good price usually they charge almost 5 dollars for the same amount of time
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This long running series offers a bit of everything.  Yes in the beginning this looks very plausible as the FBI investigates unusual occurrences and ultimately parallel universes, but it doe fall completely into the realm of sci-fi once answers to questions are revealed, particularly &#34;the observers&#34;.  But , this is excellent entertainment with all the fixings (suspense, sci-fi, tense amorous relationships, mystery etc.)  Enjoy it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am specially recommend it for beach vacations. You can spend good time playing this game if you wait for a flight at airport or even if you have flight delays
B003U9W3GM|5.0|I like the personal accounts of WW II veterans of both sides. One of the best I read is this. I suggest it to all, military history buffs or not!!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|You'll enjoy this :-) It's fun and habit-forming. Procrastination: just ONE more level becomes the mantra. Habit-forming, it's hard to put down.
B00112GVFO|5.0|music is great.  movie is great.  it is just fun to watch over and over.  I highly recommend this movie for everyone.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|and this game has stood the test of time. They're still loving it, and I like the problem-solving involved. Too fun!
B0064MGU98|3.0|This show is well written considering it was edited for television.  Since this is only first season, six episodes, watching, I cannot give a fair rating.  (Too many newer shows to watch.)
B004XMMSZG|5.0|So handy to have! I no longer have to constantly 'undress' my iphone if I want to dock it. I listen to podcasts at work and using the DockBoss is so much more convenient!<br />I do wish it was compatible with the large Sony boombox we use at home when we work out, but I'm sure that day will come. Overall, I am very happy with this product.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Of course, I fell for the hunky lead character in this show, who I think looks like Thomas Jane (HBO, Hung), heart-throb sigh!
B00002DEBW|2.0|I bought this CD based on the one track I listened to on Sirius, and also because of the &#34;great&#34; reviews I read on Amazon. Although &#34;The Romantic Warrior&#34; song is pretty good, the rest of the CD just doesn't measure up to the kind of work I've come to expect from Chick Corea. Here's what I consider to be a much superior product by Corea and gang: Chick Corea Elektric Band &#34;Beneath The Mask&#34;. This collection offers amazing, masterful Fusion featuring Eric Marienthal (soprano sax), John Patitucci ( 5 string bass)...I don't think there is one single track on this collection that I would call less than perfect!!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Better than having to Google each time.. Gets you there faster & easier than Google & finding the correct one
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|As far as a family type film goes, I guess it's ok. I expected to see more high tech gadgetry, etc. Glad I rented it here, and not gone to a theater....
B008ROGQAE|4.0|This is a movie with which most Sci-Fi fans are quite familiar, and has a very common Sci-Fi theme: A robot comes to life, has a gun, and is not happy with those around him.  This movie, especially the dialog, is quite dated by today's standards.  I even get a few chuckles from that. This is a movie that some well really enjoy, and I fell into that group, or probably dislike quite a bit.  I doubt there is much middle ground.  If you have not seen and want to try it, the good news is that you will know before 30 minutes into which group you fall.
B0052FDRI0|5.0|BVB once again proves that they know what they're doing when it comes to melody, meaning, and talent. They have their own style that flows from one album to another. You won't be able to put this album down either.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|I love this 80's anime. I like how the director uses the Environmental impact that humans have done to world and isn't afraid to use violence.
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|BVB brings another album to the table that is great to listen to. The whole album flows smoothly, but packs a punch as well. You won't be able to put this one down either.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This Film uses the same premise from his early work NausicAA. I recommend both films even though this one is bit shorter.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My husband read this book upon recommendation from a medical doctor, who is a friend of ours.  He loved this book and could not put it down until finished.  He kept reading me parts and telling me about the book all the while he was reading.  I can't wait to read it too.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love how the director pays attention to detail. A Great fantasy family film. I wish it was in Blu-Ray.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I read the book without seeing the movie.  The first quarter of the book moves slow for me, but once he was shipwrecked with the tiger, it peaked my interest and kept it throughout to the end.  I have talked with people who loved it, including my college age granddaughter.  Our book club had mixed reactions, but on the whole they liked it.
B004XWMXW4|4.0|I fell in love wit this group the first time I heard them play. They make a cello sing like no other.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this program and can't wait until I get the complete third season . I Love EACH OF HIS BOOKS Great hope there will be another season.  Love it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This season was not a disappointment.  The story line is interesting and the lives of the people are intriguing.  I always hate seeing the credits roll.  It is just that good.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|I think this is so cute. Absolutely not necessary but fun anyway. Thanks I hope you have as much fun with it as I have
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was not a disappointment.  The story line is interesting and the lives of the people are intriguing.  I always hate seeing the credits roll.  It is just that good.<br /><br />I can't believe i have to wait to January for season 4.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never read a stephen King book prior to this. (I do not tend to like books that will give me nightmares) However! This book was recommended to me by a friend and I absolutely loved it. It's a great adventure (not outdoorsy like into the wild but still intense) and there is a little bit of romance which I enjoyed, but it's not a girly book either. Regardless if you are remotely considering reading this novel I HIGHLY recommend it!!
B0042816YK|5.0|It was WONDEROUS & Faboulus!!!!  Woooooo HOOOOOO!!!!  It is because of this movie that I'm  doing a &#34;Round Robin&#34; in Italy.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|great acting, camera work, storyline... just be sure to check your DVDs as soon as you get them. I went through two where The Dark Knight didn't play at all while the other played no problem. I had to settle for a refund for the one DVD and then getting it separately.<br /><br />Let's see if these new upcoming super hero flicks can maintain a solid performance such as this. The Dark Knight Trilogy set the bar pretty high.
B00012FXB8|3.0|Alien 3 has never been the best of the series. But after watching the special edition and listening to some commentary, I find I can appreciate what they were trying to do with it much better. I still think there's far too much blood to be realistic, and definitely too much for my taste, but overall I find I can appreciate the efforts they made much better after hearing the filmmakers talk about their goals and concepts.<br />This edition comes with both the theatrical and special edition, and there's good reason to watch both. The special edition, for instance, contains an entire subplot revolving around Golic that I found to actually be quite interesting.<br />The movie is still mired in a number of problems, but, as I said, I can appreciate the movie much better with a broader understanding of the process they went through to make it.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Great book. Got a little confusing at the end or at least hard to picture but all around excellent.  I enjoyed every minute of reading.
B008602KQI|4.0|I really liked the movie. The suspense was good. I would recommend it for viewing. May there will be a sequel.
6301066642|4.0|I loved the song, even though the movie wasn't as memorable as I'd hoped. Glad I could get it to watch it anyway! Thanks!
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|I like these fairy tale remakes.  It was fun and funny the actors are great and the story line was acceptable.
B001NKI60W|5.0|So fun remembering all the songs from when I was a kid and seeing them set to a story, loved the story as well.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The avengers is action packed, the actors are fantastic and the story is excellent.  I can't wait until the next one.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Very interesting take on early Oz before Dorothy and Toto.  Love the witches...and the whole premise for the movie.<br />Plenty of special effects and enough action to keep the movie moving along.  Loved, loved, loved!!!
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Lots of great fight scenes, bad bad guys, good good guys and a somewhat interesting plot.  It was a hoot for people who like bang bang shoot'em up flicks
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I just highlighted the parts of the book that applied to me. I followed the diet about 90% and lost 15 lbs in one month. I would recommend the book and the diet.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Very romantic and dramatic, everything you want in a good masterpiece classic version. Had a sexuality to it that was not evident in other versions, the desire was great and the actor who played the villan was great.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Keeps you wanting more! I can't wait to watch the next episode but am doing it slowly because I don't want it to end!!
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Great &#34;chic flick&#34;.  Movie was great could have been longer, you need to read the book its even better, movie left some stuff out.
B00005ASOC|4.0|Older movie that I needed to add to my collection.  It was cheaper than all the stores I went to.
0425252868|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, not just for the story, which is amazing in itself, but for the insights into the German perspective of the war. I was stunned at the figures related to the numbers of German fighter pilots who survived the war and how they were treated after the war ended. If only we could learn to accept each other without having to go through such tragic circumstances. Highly recommend this book.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Some people are just good at what they do...they have a gift.<br />It makes you feel good with no bad words.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|An excellent book that is full of information, insight, and kindness, yet very enjoyable to read.  A very good choice for a dog owner or trainer.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I am not finished with the book, but so far find it very interesting.  Hosseini is an excellent writer. Will continue to read his books.<br />Although written about the same country as his first two, this was not as violent as the second book, which I thought was<br />excellent, but this does depict the harshness of life especially in the countryside.  A good read.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|8 year old loves it!  Worth the money... exciting for this age range.  I recommend buying, lego movies are great.
145210655X|5.0|My 1 year old son handed this to his Star Wars loving daddy for Father's Day and it was a big hit. The idea of Darth raising a 4 year old Luke is pretty funny in and of itself and the merge with some actual Darth quotes along with the scenes of the movies - this is a clever must have for any Star Wars lover. I'm planning to get the Princess Leia one in the future when we have a daughter to hand it over for her Father's Day gift :)
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is always good reading plus cheap on Amazon. It's a good book to have on your device because you can read the stories at different times and always go back to it.The books and chapters are all annotated for easy location. Whenever I start a new book in a series like this I bookmark the first page. This lets me know which ones I've read when I start jumping around the table of contents.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love it because every chapter was different, every case was unique.<br />The language and trama are very well done.<br />I recomend it to every one.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|Fun fun looks good nice graphics love it you will too try it you will see what I mean if you snooze you lose...... very good game
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|It's the way of the future for prospective employers looking for new talent. A must for any professional wanting to be noticed.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The book is good, but follows Season 1 exactly, down to even the dialogue.  It was helpful in understanding all of the relations of the characters, but all in all was a little boring wihtout the element of the unknown.  Also difficult to not imagine the TV characters while reading, would suggest reading before the show.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|i never seen it before the special effects was great and i think depp played a good mad hatter all the players was awsome ann hathaway just loved it just could have a dream like that just loved it all around fun now for the kiddies pg is just for some things in it that could scare them but just a good movie i would watch again
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the coolest game on the app store for the people that are giving one star and saying there's no exploding tent or monster that's not true because there is in survival if I could I'd give this game a million stars that's all I have to say you should buy it it's definitely worth 7 bucks
B00D5RJTQ6|1.0|Admittedly; Ronnie Radke has suffered more than average bumps and dips in his career.  Off to a good start with the Escape the Fate debut CD; then stuff goes seriously wrong and he is quickly in prison, and kicked from the band he co created.  Some serious travails to give anyone pause; Ronnie used the energy to create a stellar debut CD for Falling in Reverse..............not many people could.  Unfortunately, for what is likely a compendium of personal and professional reasons, this CD sounds like Ronnie has fallen into the classic trap of believing in the image he's created for himself.  While I give him credit for not cloning Raised by Wolves; he's chosen to not build and grow on that success and excellent music base, but to go off the iconoclastic deep end into this new release.  It sounds rap, pop metal, and mostly all the same (from one tune to the next).  Ronnie; why hast thou forsaken us, by losing your way?  What ever he does for the next CD (if there is one); I pray to the music gods he doesn't install bolts and electrodes in his neck and head...................the look is NOT him, nor is the sound of this CD.  :(
B00119ZMKW|5.0|If you enjoy sci fi action, then you should watch Stargate. Season 1 starts out a little corny, but by season 6 its all business (with great banter). Watch this.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great fun watching this period of history re-enacted ... This episode is well worth watching and the actors are believable and sets are breath-taking ...
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love this app!  Google is my 1st choice in a search engine, so when I saw this app, I had to get it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have always struggled with the logical side of my brain, thinking that it just doesn't make sense. But that has never stopped me from believing. Experiences such as Dr. Alexander's give us hope beyond the gospel from a skeptic's point of view.
0307237699|4.0|Regardless of your feelings about the president, if you're looking for insight into who Barack Obama is, especially in regard to his political philosophy and how it was shaped, then you should start right here. Now, in the second term of his presidency, many of the challenges to enacting his agenda that he mentioned in this work have become apparent. Regardless of your opinion of him, after reading this book I think most would agree that in MOST ways, Obama is a politician who does what he says he's going to do. If you vote for him, then dislike the agenda he implements, then you've ignored years of speeches, literature and this very book.<br /><br />Personally, I think the story of President Obama's life, his childhood, his family, his upbringing, are far more intriguing than his philosophical views. Dreams From My Father is a much better read and far more interesting.
B00797MB0O|5.0|This movie is so real. It's not about relationships as much as its about moving on and growing up. Things change after high school and the people we once knew are different. We ourselves have also changed. This movie is about being content with how our lives have developed and accepting those changes. I love this movie because it proves you don't have to have the cookie-cutter life society encourages, it is about being different and enjoying that.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|Just as advertised. Fits kindle great, and really protects it. A great buy for anyone and i strongly recommend it.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|After playing these on the consoles, I had to pick this up when I got a Kindle Fire HD.  The thrill is just the same, if not more, since I can play this on the go.  Zen Studios made an extremely well put together set of tables that bring true justice to the force and (in my opinion) are among the best Star Wars games ever made.
B004XS97KO|5.0|The characters are the best yet. You'll fall in love with them all, I assure you, if you haven't already. Another great season from Doctor Who, this one is even better than the last, though it's hard to believe it can possibly get any better. The only thing I want to complain about is the Daleks(?) - I hate them, they're annoying - but they're supposed to be unlikeable, since they're villains, right? Anyway, I highly recommend to those who like science fiction and time-travel adventures that are family-safe.
B00821PCJS|2.0|I got lost from where it's startered. The more i kept watching it did not explained how and why so i stop watching.
B003HYNB34|5.0|Though I was angry and sad about the switch in doctors (again) for the first few minutes, I was quickly won over. The introduction of the new doctor and the girl who waited starts this best-yet season of Doctor Who. The characters are the most likeable yet, I think, and ones that we can settle with for a few seasons. If you don't start with the first season, I suggest starting with this one, because you won't be able to get enough of the doctor when you watch him work in this season, and will go back and watch the others afterward, I'm sure, once you're caught up. I highly recommend for fans of science fiction, time-travel, and paranormal romance. This show will not disappoint!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My 11 year old nephew downloaded this game and everyone has taken a turn playing. Who can beat who? Who has gone the longest? etc. From my 18yr old nephew to my 9 year old nephew plus my sister and me ... we have all had a blast trying to outlast each other. Fun game!
B003KLGKAA|5.0|Though I'm not a huge fan for the leading lady of this season, I did get attached to her, too. The doctor and my emotional attachment to him and the story carry over to make this season the most exciting and most powerful yet. I highly recommend to fans of science fiction and time-travel stuff. This will not disappoint!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very helpful to have this on your phone/tablet.<br />Don't have to carry around an actual Bible.<br />I would recommend this!
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|It ranks up there with the other die hard stories.  It was good. It kept moving each minute and was hard to take my eyes off of it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Never knew this existed.... a really nice application to flip through, but please note quite addictive.<br />Loads of helpful information.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|It was a strange movie and Helen Hunt was very open in this movie.  It was hard to watch because of the nudity and I would not recommend it to everyone.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King gives us a peek into the world of Carnies, something most of us only glimpse at church carnivals or the State fair. As usual, he adds a little Stephen King twist with an unsolved murder and a few truly psychic insights. Great summer read.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Typical Amanda Bynes. Fun, harmless comedy. A few great songs. The whole family can enjoy this silly unlikely story. Colin Firth is always enjoyable as the loveable bumbling brit.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|When I first took a look at this on a friend's recommendation, the prologue didn't intrigue me particularly.  But it was a book club choice, so when I sat down with it seriously, the narrator, Lou, grabbed me from chapter one.  Ended up loving the book, as did EVERYONE in my book club -- and that is a very rare occurrence.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|It was a good show. Definitely something I wouldn't mind watching with my family. I really am upset they cancelled the show after only four seasons, even though the show had good ratings!
B005ES1232|5.0|First of all, let me say this is my first pair of Crocs. I think the rugged sole makes them look much better than the originals. I tried some regular Crocs on in the store to get a size and they seem to fit the same. While on a shore excursion in Mexico, a vendor had these exact styles for $66 US. I know these guys are tours traps but even so, Amazon is cheaper than anybody I've seen.
B00005JMAH|5.0|While The Goblet of Fire, Half Blood Prince, and The Deathly Hallows are my favorites, The Prisoner of Azkaban is probably one of the best of the series.(on screen and in book) The subject of this review? Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.<br /><br />Harry Potter who is now 13 years old, begins his journey after a hilarious encounter with his rather displeasing Aunt, Marge. Harry is on his way back to Hogwarts yet again but gets information on a mysterious escaped prisoner Sirius Black. We get a movie that once again delivers the thrills, suspense, laughs, and magical wonder for the eyes and the imagination. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson return as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They were all great in their respective roles. We have Robbie Coltrane returning as Hagrid, and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. Great acting by each individual. Newcomers include Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore; his performance was exceptional. We also have David Thewlis as Remis Lupin; he did a really great job. Finally, we are given a brilliant performance by Gary Oldman who portrays Sirius Black. The acting never fails in these movies, Great Job.<br /><br /> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is just a good film (and great story overall) by all means and as a movie, it gets a score of<br /><br />5 Stars
0307743659|5.0|This in my opinion is along with Pet Semetary King's greatest novel, everything else is unreadable, overwritten and unconvincing. But in The Shining as in Pet Semetary the story is clean, dramatic, and suffers from none of King's later unconvincing editorializing and stuffing (talking about Twinkies, pop culture, rock and roll, etc, all of which detracts and kills whatever \\"horror\\" there is). Let's face it, King's major influence is EC comics, which is not exactly confidence building (imagine Lovecraft had admitted such a thing) but there is nothing \\"EC\\" about The Shining. This is essential horror. If King had written nothing else he would have gone down in the history of supernatural horror for this alone. Strangely, The Shining is rarely included in lists of the best horror (e.g. Karl Wagner's). Also, I'd like to see a new trade edition of IT, a novel I have never been able to finish but always want to have yet another go at.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|We have watched it many times. The concentration camp is a harsh situation treated beautifully. I don't speak Italian but prefer to watch it in Italian with English subtitles.
B008RVAAPE|4.0|Enjoyable and enthralling multi-character hisorical drama. Convincing medieval background, obviously extensively researched. Quite realistic on sex and violence. Insightful about little-known period
B0069UP2PI|3.0|The film and acting were not well done. This is a very serious situation that probably will happen some time. The film needs to be well enough done to make people think about it. I'd love to see a well-done documentary on this.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Just my opinion, however, this felt like a good story stretched out too much.  I was just getting into the story when the movie was over. because of this, I'll probably not be watching the next movie in the series.  I'll probably just read the book.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This was one of the most inspirational stories I have ever read. I was amazed at how well the author was able to show what Hannah was going through before she took her life.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|this has always been my favorite series on tv, needless to say, i really enjoyed watching it again on amazon.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My horse is a good game. It's like having your own horse. Although it isn't the best game, it's pretty good.
0316017930|4.0|Talent is great to have but you need mostly hard work and the right circumstances to achieve something in life. That seems to be the main thesis of this book. But it well worked out and clearly written. He really is a very original thinker that makes you look at things you take for granted in a different light. I would read anything he writes.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|I give this book 4 stars. Pretty motivational, although I did not take every single idea seriously, nor did I agree with all of it. It did give me quite an emotional boost and provided the attitude adjustment that I needed at this time in my life. Worth a read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not to hard but not to easy. Defiantly need to use your brain. Only 10 levels but great for a fee app. give it a go!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Wonderful program with excellent actors and a sweet story line. Love everything about it! Highly recommend it for light entertainment and suitable for family watching too.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Wish the movie followed the book better bc the book is a lot better. They left a lot of important stuff out...
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is the best spider man game I have play in my life so play it if you are a spider man fan
B00CELB94E|5.0|This album is amazing. I got the bonus with the extra tracks and can't stop listening to it. It has stunning sound on big speakers. I was not expecting Liam and co. to produce such a fine piece of art. I think in many ways it's a step forward from Oasis. I hope they tour in America soon. Long live BDI
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Definitely recommend.  If you like his previous books you will enjoy this also.  Being a Mason I really enjoyed this one.  Just remember it IS FICTION !  As any really good fiction writer he mixes just enough factual information with the story to make it believable and interesting.  Now looking forward to reading Inferno.
3836538725|5.0|I have seen Sebastiao Salgado's work about migrations in walls as big as 10 x 15 feet and it was beautiful and shocking at the same time then.<br />With his new book, Genesis, I was happily surprised in discovering a new Sebastiao Salgado: more optimistic, more hopeful and with a body of work beyond my best imagination.<br />All his work is in black and white. Not any black and white. An AMAZING black and white collection.<br />What an artist, and what a privilege to own his book. I look at this book for inspiration every week. I show my friends, and I talk about it.<br />It is a very thick and heavy book, with fine art quality.<br />I love the beautiful book that Steve McCurry has - Iconic-Photographs-Standard Edition - (it was my last year's Christmas gift!). This book is in the same level or maybe better for a fan of black and white like me.<br />If you have any doubt about ordering or not, just do it. It is a beautiful book.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Like the Coen Brothers' The Big Lebowski, Rian Johnson's freshmen feature makes a neo-noir tale by putting characters who you wouldn't expect to see in a mystery film into film-noir situations. With some great performances (including a slyer than ever Joseph Gordon Levitt) and slickly witty slang dialogue, Johnson takes a seemingly simple premise and adds some innovative flavor to create a deadly original yarn.<br />Brendan (Levitt), having recently discovered the corpse of an old lover, plays the role of detective in search for answers. On the way to the truth, he crosses paths with a seemingly perfect damsel, a manipulative school theater actress, a cool brainiac, an overheated muscle for a young crime syndicate, and a cane-toting coat-wearing drug kingpin (and his mother).<br />Featuring crisp dialogue, atmospheric cinematography, organicly sparse music, and a downright cool style, Brick is a force to be reckoned with, and a refreshingly original take on the neo-noir genre.<br />As for the R-Rating, I'm almost confused as to why the film was rated so harshly. There is no cursing, little violence, and while the drug content is integral to the story no drug use is ever actually portrayed on the film (other than cigarette smoking). In my opinion the film should have gotten a PG-13 from the MPAA.<br />About the DVD: Great transfer, clear picture, great sound. Focus Features has a way with making all of their products very well. Bonus features include a cast and crew commentary, twenty minutes of deleted scenes, and a documentary about the casting.
B000J10ER4|4.0|this film kind of let me down of course no one can replace Christopher  reeves as superman.but this actor has proven he's up for the chance to do it.outstanding story line.thank you for the quick service(it was faster than a speeding bullet)
B008GXHOFW|5.0|For only one dollar your getting a game that is so good and so fun! Trust me, you will be really happy if you buy this.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I started playing Spider when I got bored with the regular solitarie, it's very addictive. There are additional levels each one more difficult, but I have never gotten past the first level (2 suits).
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It was a little easy but I'm hoping the game will I'm prove on that. I like this game!! Hope when th game improves that we don't have to by a full version.
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun playing was at level 140 but kindle broke<br />will start over again hope it don't break again but will still try overall is a good time killer
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You don't have to have played Temple Run to appreciate Temple Run 2, but this is a great continuation of the brand. Still highly addictive, fun, and an easy way to burn 5 minutes, or 5 hours.
6305657947|4.0|When i was growing up, I watched the Pink Panther movies starring Peter Falk; I always enjoy a good bank robbery. (Movie - I mean movie!)<br /><br />I am going to go off-topic for a second: I don't like it when every 5 seconds someone is cursing (The Heist, The Score, Heat, et al) - to me, if you have to curse you better be physically hurt - show a touch of sophistication if you are going to curse. My Drill Instructor in Basic Training cursed, but never used the same word in two consecutive sentences and you almost laughed at the same time you were intimidated. Off-topic anyhow, because there isn't any of that in this movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed the original version of this movie, so I bought this one - very similar plots, and both versions are enjoyable to me.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very pleased with this production. Hard to stop watching. Great action and effects. Great character dynamics. Interesting SHTF scenario. Interesting take on militia.
B0053FANRC|4.0|Sort of a prequel - who cares though. It has fast cars, cool driving, blood-pumping music, hot Asian models, and Vin Diesel makes a purely cameo appearance at the end.<br /><br />If you like Fast and Furious, you will like this one. The behind the scenes extras were kind of neat - who knew there was no such thing as a film permit in Japan?
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Just love it loved all the characters great story couldn't wait for season 2 to start looking forward for more
B00003CXDV|4.0|Summary - Like a funny version of any Star Trek episode. Tim plays an angry drunk Sci-Fi series actor, and things start getting &#34;real&#34;. I won't ruin it, but if you didn't mind watching the original Star Trek TV shows, you will enjoy this. If you don't watch Sci-Fi shows you may have a hard time getting some of the memes, but this is a family friendly movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Works fine on kindle fire. Walkthrough online if you are stuck. Fun game, not too hard. 10 levels with more to come.
B0002J4X1Q|2.0|I liked the game. I like watching Milla Jovovich. Did not like this movie, however. There are a few neat scenes such as the &#34;slice and dice&#34; lasers, but it never caught my attention and held it the whole movie, the way the original Aliens movie did. Just my opinion - take it for what it's worth.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|If you're thinking \\"Do I really need to read ANOTHER popular science book about physics?\\", look here: This book has a lot of information about Something, and then the last two chapters are about Something from Nothing. If you've read and enjoyed books like [[ASIN:B003TXSF5C The Grand Design]] or [[ASIN:B009S8AV1I Quantum: A Guide For The Perplexed]], then you're going to enjoy this book. There is some stuff you probably already know, but we like reading about physics, right? The book doesn't have a PROVEN theory of making a universe from nothing, though. However, it is a compatible theory. As Krauss argues, this might be the best thing we will have for a long time.<br /><br />If you're thinking \\"Wow, I have never read a book like this and I don't know if I'm up to it\\", look here: You may think this is way over your head, but don't worry! Prof. Krauss takes his time to explain his ideas. You probably won't understand everything on your first read-through, but you will understand a lot and come out of it with an expanded mind.<br /><br />Some thoughts on the actual book: It's well written, and worth reading if you have a remote interest in how the Universe might have started. It won't give you the complete picture about the competing physical theories though. Personally I'd like the size of the parts about Nothing, and the parts about Something to be swapped. What I wanted from the book was a whole lot of Nothing and Universes starting up, and so I was a little disappointed there wasn't so much material about that. I enjoyed it though, cheers Prof. Krauss!
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|I saw this on TV and had to buy it so I could re-watch it. I enjoyed it the first time on TV, and enjoyed it again at home. It has an interesting plot - what would you do if you could see into the future? What if you could only see a few minutes into the future? What if suddenly you saw events from a more distant future, but only when a certain girl was around.<br /><br />Anyhow, I found the plot interesting and the scenes enjoyable to watch.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|The EAGLES...what more can I say!  WE LOVE THEM and this DVD!  Sound was great and the songs brought back memories!!
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|The subject line of the review pretty much sums it up. People invent robot clones to take their place in the dangerous real world while they stay safely locked in their homes. Someone dies. Bruce Willis runs off to fight the evil. Stuff happens.<br /><br />I suppose there is sort of a moralistic tale about over-immersing yourself in online games or social networking in here somewhere. Like some other movies I buy, I bought it for the action and it was good.
B005C8ENI0|2.0|Should have paid more attention to the R rating.  This was a mistake on my part.  Should not have rented in the first place.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|I enjoyed the movie - a little cursing here and there, but still a good action romp. I am writing this in June 2013, when the recent NSA scandal is in the news, and I couldn't help be reminded of the real-world NSA complex being built in Bluffdale Utah - I did a double take when I saw the real thing in the news and thought - did the NSA use Bruce WIllis's set?<br /><br />Anyhow, I enjoyed this movie - the NSA is free to add their own comments in reply...
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Densel is as usual a superb actor.  The end is somewhat surprising but very good.  Recommend it to anyone needing to think about a real social problem.
1594135851|3.0|Continues the story of Katness as she begins a victory ride through all of the Districts.<br /><br />Don't read this unless you have read &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; - it doesn't stand by itself.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I received this brand new DVD some time ago and have thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  I especially liked how it was placed  on my Amazon so I don't even have to load the DVD!!  That's just too convenient...but I have used this option smarmy times and  I really like this.  Thank you for this service.
B000HT1WYW|4.0|Honestly, I bought it because it starred Milla Jovovich. Initially I was confused - was this anime or a movie? What was happening? How would it end? But the fight scenes kept immersing my mind back into the movie. I ended up liking the movie - I didn't give it 5 stars only because initially I was confused and that broke the &#34;immersion&#34;.
B001AQIYJC|4.0|It was an interesting  movie but a sad ending.  The plot was good and the actors were great.  I love Meg Ryan.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I think I only ran across Chuck on TV ONCE. But that single episode was enough to get me onto Google, and I was hooked. Finally, a series where the geek is the hero. (Now we have The Big Bang Theory as well).
B00CH87HF4|5.0|nice game needs cheaper weaponry. like the blood and stufff.awesome game awesome game.add more characters. also more classes And quicker upgrades
B004XQO90O|5.0|Interesting plot twist - I sort of guessed what was happening the second or third time through, and found myself trying to encourage the character to try certain things on the next try through.<br /><br />I know this sounds cryptic but I don't want to spoil the plot for you.<br /><br />Basically a bomb blows up a train, and the main character tries to stop it - over and over again.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This book is a wonderful read; fast-paced, with clearly delineated characters. It is an adventure tale, and an inner adventure. I can hardly wait for the other installments of this mind-bending - AND MIND-OPENING saga.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|This has a much better range of sound than the Logitech H250 stereo headset with boom mike - voices sound deeper and richer. The one issue I have with this mike, I really have to blame on my environment - it picks up every noise in the room. If you have a sound studio this isn't a big deal; otherwise like in my case, I found myself doing a lot of editting to reduce or remove extraneous background noise in between talking.<br /><br />I bought this together with a 15 foot XLR-to-1/4&#34; mike cable, and plugged it into a EQ/mixer to remove any ground loop before inputting it into the computer. Works like a champ, but I can hear planes fly over in the background (I live a mile from a runway) and I can hear quiet noises in the same room, and noises from the other rooms in my house. Maybe I will build a sound-blocking studio room one day to get the full effect of this mike.
B009GXHOW4|1.0|I bought this app because it was rated 4 stars, I open the app and it says that I have to buy PocketInvEditor Pro in order to play. I wouldn't recommend this app to ANYBODY. No wonder it's free
B00CW665VI|5.0|Excellent writing. The author did a great job expressing the thoughts of the main character. I love how everything is so realistic...
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I'm not a Sodoku fanatic, but I do like to play.  This app makes playing so easy and fun.  There are thousands of games that range from very easy to &#34;you'll never figure it out.&#34;  Great for every level of player.  I highly recommend this game.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This move was pretty good. I truthfully wasn't into watching it but it ended up being decent. Good action scenes....the witches are of course a bit unreal but they're witches....It's worth watching!
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|The same thing - I simply love his way of using the language - all the small details and then his insight
B00BMT9C84|3.0|This movie was ok. It was pretty funny and I was surprised Barbara didn't sing....not once....but it was an ok movie.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|keeps me updated on current and future conditions and alerts me when severe weather is in the offing.<br /><br />the adverts scrolling at the top are small, but still visible.  but i guess you get what you don't pay for.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love this movie! It is so much fun and I enjoy watching it again and again....I'm glad they are making another! Great kids movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Surprisingly complete. Usually by the third book in a series, some of the excitement and novelty wears off. Not in this case! From start to finish, I couldn't put this book down.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|and after I've (finally!) finished it, I can honestly say that it's the best game I've played so far on the Kindle.<br /><br />Beautiful graphics, accurate controls, frustrating puzzles that you must figure out through trial and error, humor, great sound and music.  I was addicted to this game and was impossible to live with for the time it took me to complete.<br /><br />To those who created this game--you have fascinating minds, and I thank you for the hours of enjoyment I experienced.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the 3rd book by this author that I have read and I find it very well written and interesting. His characters are real and although some of the subject matter is hard to read, I believe he is doing his best to shed light on his homeland. I cannot wait for the next book by Hosseini !
B008J34466|5.0|Great album, great lyrics.  The only fuss is that the guitar doesn't come through the mix very well, and she has an excellent guitar player.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Very nice set from old blue eyes.  Should be part of any big band collector's library.  Very wide range of Frank's cuts.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Hey, it's Taylor Swift.  She has a tough time doing anything wrong, I guess.  Of course the lyrics are typical of a person of that age, but that's to be expected.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best entertainment and the best game that anyone could ever play it could keep your child very busy for the rest of the day and then some
B008TMOIEK|5.0|The music is absolutely the best!  If you like piano music you will melt away with this one.  I have it on loop and get lost in the beautiful music
140053271X|1.0|This thing has not worked right since I received it! You read three or four pages and it will freeze every time. I bought one from my daughter and have not had a problem with that one!
B003A9SYTW|3.0|I should've just bought the song, Beat the Devil's Tattoo. I love that song, but I can't seem to 'dig' this band's entire album.<br />How can you review art...it's just my opinion!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome because it gives  you  the awesome feel of mincraft so I think you should by the game really
143911000X|5.0|Really fun book to have. Kinda like the play book.. All And all legend wait for it dary. Really big letters..
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like another zombie movie, but Warm Bodies was different and sucked me right in. Loved it!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Both my kids are enjoying this game. They love that it has the characters and things in it from the movie.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|the  best story ive ever read<br />trulely a cant put it down book<br />a heart pounding thriller<br />dan brown is the master of thrillers
B00632HWOG|5.0|Purchasing obscure children's books by our favorite authors; obtaining gifts for family living abroad; and  selecting birthday, anniversary, and get well gifts that are gift wrapped with a heartfelt enclosure that arrive on time has streamlined my life.  Amazon has saved me so much time and money. Prime is perfect. The selections are endless. I use these services almost  weekly. Thank you and continue the good works.
B001DF68MA|3.0|If my 14 month old son could write a review of this, I'm sure he'd give it five stars!  He loves going for bike rides with his Dad and seems very comfortable in the seat.  He sits quite upright, which is good for absorbing bumps etc.  It must be quite comfortable because he's fallen asleep on more than one occasion!  I love that he's sat in front of me so we can talk he can point out the birds and squirrels that he sees!<br /><br />So why did Dad only give it 3 stars?  Well there are several reasons:<br /><br />1) Mounting Bar Construction/Engineering<br /><br />The mounting bar is crudely made and heavy.  I've spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars shaving weight off my bike only to slap this thing on it.... hmm.<br /><br />Also it takes a long time to add/remove the bar.  A socket set helps, but it's still a pain.  I would gladly pay more for a bar that included a quick release mechanism.  I leave it on for commuting to work but remove it for serious riding.<br /><br />Tip: You can save a bit of time here by removing your seat post and seat post clamp, then sliding the bar off without undoing it all the way.<br /><br />2) Seat attachment concerns<br /><br />The seat attaches to the bar with a single bolt, that you tighten up by hand.  The bolt goes though a slit in the base of the child seat and a washer spreads the load on the plastic as you tighten it down.  To me this doesn't seem like enough security.  The plastic at this part of the seat is quite thick and I have no evidence of the system failing, but none-the-less I think there should be a second point of attachment, at the rear of the seat for example.<br /><br />3) Overal seat construction<br /><br />I suppose that using very thin plastic reduces the weight of the seat but it does seem cheap.  The hand rest also attaches with just a single bolt and I don't know if there's a fault with mine but I can't get the bolt to screw in more than a few turns and it wobbles a bit.<br /><br />4) Riding position constraints<br /><br />Make sure you go for a test ride before you put baby in it.  I'm glad I did because at the first time I came up to a stop sign I suddenly realized that I couldn't put my foot down by stepping forwards because there's no room for my crotch between my saddle and the seat.<br /><br />I couldn't find a solution for this, except dropping my saddle to a point where I can stay on the saddle and put my toes on the ground.  Obviously this has hampered my ergonomics a little but I don't do more than a few miles of gentle riding, so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall<br />------<br /><br />So there you go.  When I first unpacked the thing I was initially tempted to return it, but my son loves it so that's not an option now.  I would be tempted to try the [[ASIN:B008Y9HI2W iBert Child Bicycle Safe-T-Seat]] and see if it's any better but I don't think it will fit my bike and it's reviews aren't really much better.ints<br /><br />Make sure you go for a test ride before you put baby in it.

I would be tempted to try the [[ASIN:B008Y9HI2W iBert Child Bicycle Safe-T-Seat]] and see if it's any better but I don't think it will fit my bike and it's reviews aren't really much better.
0553565915|5.0|I actually purchased this book a few years ago and loved it.  I told friends and co workers about it so of course it was lent out and I never saw it again.  I was discussing the story with someone recently and decided to buy another copy to reread.  It was even more inspirational than I remember.  I'm also reading the bible and this story correlates with what I hold true.  It definitely not only strengthens faith but also makes you want to be a better person to fulfill your own calling.  My copy is again lent out but this time I wrote my name in it!
B001BANK32|5.0|The Shining was the first Stephen King book I ever read, and I absolutely loved it. Like many other readers, I had already seen the movie several times and decided to give the book a go. Sometimes seeing a movie before reading the book kind of spoils the fun of reading the book, but not this time. The book goes in to so much background and history of the main characters, and explores phenomena of the Overlook that the movie only glosses over. So instead of the scary parts being discreet, shocking, visual moments, it's more of a long, slowly building, underlying suspense that just gets more and more terrifying.<br /><br />I always read before going to bed, even when it's a horror book, EVEN while I was reading THIS book. I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning each night because I was too scared to shut off the light and go to sleep. A few times I had to stop mid-page and pick it back up after the sun came up. I've never read a book that scared me so much, but in the most enjoyable way possible! I highly recommend this book. I'd say it's a good \\"summer read\\" only because you might want to read it in the safety of broad daylight.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire is exactly what you would want from the second installment of the Hunger Games series.  it doesn't try to overreach in being particularly profound but provides an addictive, engaging story line. There are surprising twists and turns throughout the story that make it impossible to put down.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Great story and a performance by Ellen DeGeneres that reaches all ages.  Yes, it's a bit sad, in the way so many Disney movies are sad (do I have to spell it out?  LOL).  My little granddaughters got sad the first time they watched it--for about 60 seconds.  Then it got so funny, they just relaxed and squealed with delight through the rest.<br />At Epcot, the Talking Turtles show has Ellen's character, and we all found that one of our faves in that park.<br />Worth watching this movie, if only for Ellen.  But I think anyone from 3 to 103 will be charmed by everything in this movie.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Bruce at his best........  Even though he has become so greedy at 3 million a day, still a good movie
178022219X|2.0|I READ THIS BOOK FOR MY BOOK CLUB AND NONE OF US LIKE THAT BOOK.  JUST A DEPRESSING, EVIL BOOK.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|The show must have been incredibly expensive to produce, the song and dance scenes were perfectly choreographed. It was worth watching just to admire all that. Overall the actors did a great job of creating real people. The story line was just 3 stars, but the show was well worth watching.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|The CD was well packed and on time. The whole really liked the movie. my grand chrilden well enjoy the movie this summer when they visit us.  Thank you
B006M7JCC2|2.0|I was excited to get this book after deciding to read it before looking at \\"Proof of Heaven\\" by Dr. Eben Alexander. I guess I was hopeful that it would provide some answers to my own questions at the core of my being like the answer to \\"You know, Life the Universe and Everything\\" . I think I was left confused after reading this account and felt dispirited and lost. I think I got more out of Douglas Adams.<br />I have a condition which took me to a place one could call near death and came back, in my view, through a spiritual experience that left me with some personal insights of my own. I found many similarities with the way Anita Moorjani felt following her release from hospital and during the recovery she experienced after going into remission. For example I find more pleasure in a sun set, a bird in flight and a flower than I ever did before. I've lost interest in trivialities, gossip and the news and at times feel disconnected from people in one way but deeply connected at a spiritual level.<br />What bothered me about this account is that I can't buy it. My recovery tells me that living the \\"right way\\" through principles of humility, honesty, service, generosity and compassion is vital. Before I didn't give a hoot about anything or anyone including myself. Reading \\"Dying to be Me\\" I hoped that I would find an account from someone who had been there and validated what I felt after my own experience. I can imagine the truth that Anita Moorjani describes, this oneness and interconnectedness with everyone and the universe. I feel that there is a source at the core of it and that we have free will, I agree to that. What I can't accept is that psychopaths share the same journey as saints and that actions and thoughts don't follow us, they do, every single one counts. We are here for a purpose, there is a divine plan. The reality of the other realm that Moorjani paints has no purpose and offers no hope and no answers and certainly no point. As someone who is rarely skeptical about these sorts of accounts I have to draw the line here and say sorry I can't buy it.
B00CX1TSSO|2.0|This movie left me wanting. I cant remember laughing once at any of the scenes I felt were supposed to be humorous. All in all I think it was poorly written with a to much focus on bringing the giants to life on screen.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I started with A Thousand Splendid Suns, followed by The Kite Runner, and have to admit that their reading was often difficult. Not because they weren't gripping, or because l got bored, but because, so often, l had to stop and allow my emotions to settle, then steady myself for continuing with another emotional onslaught.<br /><br />In this respect The Mountains Echoed is no different. You will come to know each character intimately, and wonder if your heart can take any more, then turn the page just to prove you're wrong. But you never are.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I am very happy that Vtube has the downloading feature, which I think is very useful. Vtube is an easy to use tool. The Vtube interface, however, uses precious left screen space for options/functionality. Coming from a usability perspective, in my opinion it's best to relocate these options and place them underneath the viewing window. This way the primal screen space will be dedicated to viewing. Also the terminology used for labeling some of the options I find to be ambiguous. For instance, watch later does it mean a play list?<br />Finally, the feedback message for downloading an item can be improved. Instead of \\"Add download item done\\", it could something more sraightforward like\\"your item is being downloaded\\". Finally, a visual feedback that the item has been successfully downloaded is even better!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|i am so into this book! i cant wait to get home from work so that i can get back to westeros!
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Fun game and takes away the difficulty of needing to know the rules of backgammon to play it. It lets you know what moves you may and may not do. Great for beginners. Advanced players may find it annoying.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It can be odd and confusing, but very intriguing. You Definitely have to pay attention and watch every episode or you will miss something!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Movie was okay, but for a Die Hard movie is was really anticlimatic.  Started off with a 30 minute car chase and then went downhill from there.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Great movie for whole family! First time watching a movie on Kindle and it was a neat experience as well.
0470449764|4.0|hopefully it helps with my GMAT prep. i'm really nervous! this provided a lot of information about how the test is set up as well as the material its covered.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Let's start by saying I've been a Firefly fan for the better part of a decade, now.  So I will admit, biased review.  It's such a shame that the show was cancelled so early, but at the same time... I rather enjoy rewatching it and puzzling over the various unsolved mysteries.  What was Book's secret past?  Does Mal ever grow beyond his need to fly?  How to Zoey handle her situation after the end of the movie?<br /><br />The fact that I still ask these questions is a testament to this story, and how in a short 16 episodes, I was so gripped by their interactions that I still wonder about them almost 10 years later.  I can't say any other show has ever taken hold of my imagination so absolutely, and for that, Firefly is not just good, not just unique, but downright special in the world of TV.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|By chapter 4 I already felt I got my money's worth and started telling family and friends about the data-based gems that I was uncovering within this treasure trove! I had my doubts how relatable this book would be given Ms. Sandberg's status, but this is a book for EVERYONE (yes men too, stay-at-home parents and definitely professionals) to read! It has pertinent information for our society as a whole to broach an informed and elevated discussion. It's reminiscent of that favored college prof who inspired to us action... Well done, I thoroughly enjoyed it!

B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is hilarious. Love the male POV. It's filled with hot steamy sex scenes and the outrageous thoughts of one very hot playboy!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a fun game that me and my mom love so you should download it plus its free And fun
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is fun.  It is not too hard and not too easy.  The game needs more levels.  Eight rooms is not enough.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Very good story, well told and well written. I had a little trouble with the &#34;Irish&#34; English . It's easier to hear (as in movies) than to read, but I eventually got used to it and enjoyed it.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|So far this actor, Jason Statham, is one of the best actors I've seen in a long time.  He keeps me cheering for him.  His movies keep getting better but I would like to see even more character building in future movies, as he knows how to act!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not quite as good as the first 2 books. But,<br /> I still needed to finish the trilogy to see how everything turned out for the Mockingjay.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The writing is the best for a series!  My husband and I loved the way the characters evolved, but also the way compassion and unity always shows through, as well as humor.  We just couldn't get enough of it!  Please keep going, please!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i liked it. pretty fun to play when im bored and not really hard. and i dont know what else to write... k bye
B00C061HZY|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I was excited for this album, I wanted to like it. I had put my faith into the french duo and I could not wait to hear what else they could do with a fresh new sound.<br /><br />I went to a small listening party when I got this record with other people who felt the same. Listening to this for the first time is a blast. It's different and daft punk really creates a unique sound in conrast to other current releases.<br /><br />This album utilizes a very clean, smooth sound, perhaps even a little overmastered. It sounds great on a good pair of speakers, but while rich and detailed, nothing particulsrly pops out and graps your attention on most songs.<br /><br />However, I could not find the energy to \\"love\\" this album. RAM does recycle older sounds, sounds that have been done better by people before them. That is this albums downfall, and perhaps the reason none of these tracks stood out for me.<br /><br />Nevertheless, If you are a Daft Punk fan or an EDM fan I reccomend giving RAM a listen, it's a new take on where the genre may possibly be going.<br /><br />Fav tracks: Giorgio by Morodor, Lose Yourself to Dance, Motherboard<br /><br />Least Fav: Within, Game of Love, Touch
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|The Bourne Legacy never stops! You are on a roller coaster from start to finish! It doesn't even stop for you to take a breath! Great action movie!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|What a good, comedic portrayal of pregnancy and birth! I am 8 months pregnant and I laughed and cried my way through this one.  Good movie!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|A good game app. If you are a fan of the mahjong tile game, this version is a great one to have for your Kindle Fire HD.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Title says it all. The books are great and the price for all 4 is stellar. I would buy again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased Wool because it got such great reviews.  I wasn't disappointed!  It was fast paced with an interesting story line. I just bought Shift and can't wait to read it.  Hugh Howey is one of my new favorite authors!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is pretty fun and I would recommend it to people who like to try and escape out of places. This game was fun and challenging and I am looking forward to more levels!
1118109791|5.0|this product is my new bible :) best review book I have used to prepare so far. well worth the money
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I suffer from insomnia and work a lot, so nights that I can not sleep, this game helps relax my mind and think of other things to push me asleep. In a way this game is a life saver. The only thing I would like is a hint to show up if your stuck for 15-20min...
1419553429|5.0|this book alone would not help to prepare for the GMAT but is a great addition to other review material because it is more in-depth in some areas.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Used it before. I am able to go to many web sites and get info I need. I would recommend
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series!  I really can't get enough.  She helps connect you with the characters as if they were in front of you.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Love it, great challenge! You have so much fun you forget it's a mind teaser . I can't stop playing it, I'm sort of addicted. I just hate I had to rate it to keep playing... that really SUCKS
B00CO52NLI|4.0|Great, but, could you please let us have dogs and cats FREE? I would like to have puppies and kitties for FREE! :)
0756404738|5.0|I had read this book twice and loaned my original copy to someone that failed to return it.  ARGH!  I just bought it again.  I highly recommend the series to everyone and can hardly wait for the last one.
B008Y78QIY|1.0|I cant really rate it because I cant even watch it................. I downloaded it, went to watch it, and it wont let me watch it pass 18 minuets. Needless to say, I am disappointed in amazon's downloading system.
0062255657|2.0|It's always hard to give a favorite author a bad review, but this is not Gaiman at his best.  (Read The Graveyard Book.)  The story is thin: an other-world collides with our real world, and our young narrator becomes the conduit for the evil forces and becomes the prize they fight over.  The Hempstock women, of indeterminate age, are the best characters here, though they feel they are on loan from Alice Hoffman.  The unnamed protagonist, however, is rather boring.  In his afterword, Gaiman admits he started writing this as a short story.  He should have followed his first instincts.  It was not just the ending that disappointed, it was the entire book.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark Places is another fantastic book by Gillian Flynn. The storyline is engaging and mysterious - keeps you wondering until the end. In typical Flynn style, I felt like I had most of the &#34;twist&#34; figured out, but the shocking big twist comes at the end.  I highly recommend this book, I loved reading it and could barely put it down.
1781162646|5.0|Devon Jones takes a summer job far from home to work at an amusement park. Dealing with a break up with his first love, he decides to stay on and work after the summer and take a year off from college. There is story behind the Haunted House attraction regarding a girl who was murdered there and her ghost is still inside the ride. Devon wants to see that ghost.<br /><br />Although, Steven King is known for his horror stories, this one shows that he is more than that. This is a coming of age story with a touch of the supernatural. His characterizations and descriptive narratives make this one enjoyable novel. It takes place in the seventies, and one can feel there are there; hearing the rickety roller coaster or feel the 100 degree summer heat! It is a quick read, but worth every page. King is at the top of his game.
B00687Q0VC|5.0|Although I watched this miniseries when it first came on in 2008 I found that there were things i had missed somehow and sat glued to my seat the entire show.  The acting was superb as well as set decoration and filming.  The writing was on the mark as to the real John Adams and Paul Giamatti gave the performance of a lifetime.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|The movie was great and it worked great on the kindle and the acting was great and I loved the story.
B005HE5J7I|4.0|It kept me, the reader in touch withLondon as we know it today and the historical concept of London in its evlution as a growing, living, changing city.
0394800184|5.0|This book was a favorite of our four children so it was an obvious selection for our great garanson to be. This book was received ahead of schedule in excellent condition.
0670014893|4.0|This is vintage LeCarre.  To properly enjoy this novel, one must set aside a comfortable place to savor & concentrate on every word.  You cannot and should not skim it  in order to get to the next page or event.  You must immerse yourself in the characters to appreciate their experiences.  That is exactly why John LeCarre is one of a very select few outstanding fiction authors.  I am a huge fan....
B0091REZMW|2.0|the graphics are spectacular. basically, one of the &#34;where's waldo&#34; type games. I had some trouble &#34;picking up&#34;<br /> small items - might be ok for children's fingers.
6305165912|5.0|Who could not love this movie!  It depicts people who have been highly influenced by progressive thought, in that everything is &#34;relative.&#34;  This could actually be an indictment of all things liberal with the main characters just drifting through life with no anchor or ambition.
B003PIUC02|5.0|It was delivered on time, I don't like the cardboard casing, but other than that it was worth every penny. It really is an amazing show, TWO THUMBS UP
B000IDEORY|4.0|While the acting may not be the best ever, the dancing clearly is. The music is wonderful and the story romantic. I've seen it several times since it first appeared and it continues to hold my interest (maybe because I actually remember the early 60's) and watching Patrick Swayze dance is always enjoyable.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This is the only workout DVD I've actually seen results with and fast. I believe Jillian's approach to work large and small muscle groups at the same time are the key.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|Everything about this film is outstanding including the broken heart I experienced while reliving the horror of the Holocaust. I was lucky enough to be an American in the USA at the time of World War II, but I am well aware that had I been there, I would not be here now. The acting is exemplary, the filming perfect and Ben Kingsley and Liam Neeson are both unforgettable. Steven Spielberg's dedication to the documenting of the Shoah has made us all richer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Now that I've seen all seasons (up til all hours of the night!) I can't wait until season 4 starts!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like this game!!! I play this game in the sanctuary area of my home. I've only been playing it for 2 months.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|They have a habit of blocking material that does not agree with their politics. If they are going to be in this business they should be neutral.
B00563K3DA|5.0|What a way to introduce children on how to treat others. This book will allow people of all ethnics, religions, cultures, etc. on how to truly empower oneself. I especially will incorporate edifying  others to allow them to see that a situation isn't dismal and that each situation has to be looked at as a lesson in life.  To do better; strive for better. Help others while you're transitioning into a better you!!! Good read!!!
B0041TM5OU|1.0|After waiting over two weeks for my records I was very disappointed to discover these records that claim to be new have clearly already been used and put into new packaging.
B00A757EFW|1.0|This was a challenge. I tried playing this game on my Kindle Fire. What a joke. I felt like I was playing with 2 left thumbs (I'm right handed).
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love watching Downton Abbey!  I am watching it over again and so so excited that you now have Season 3!!  Thank you Amazon Prime!!!
B007VDPMYI|5.0|Imagine the privileged thrill of sitting in the living room of your favorite musician(s) while they play their newest material for you. That's exactly how this album feels, and it's great! Doubly so for me, because \\"All Things Must Pass\\" is this Beatle Nut's favorite Harrison album. In case you're wondering, no, I never knew George, but I do have a unique take on the artist/fan perspective. More on that shortly.<br /><br />There's so much more here than \\"All Things...\\"! Of the ten tracks, four are new. Two of those, Harrison's take of his own idol, Bob Dylan's \\"Mama, You've Been On My Mind\\", and a touching version of the Everly Brothers' \\"Let It Be Me\\" are in themselves more than worth the album's cost.<br /><br />I mentioned sitting with a favorite artist while they play for you. I've had that that blessed and rare experience. If you've ever heard of the late Blues legend John Lee Hooker, I knew him very well for the final twenty years of his life. John Lee was very much my \\"Grandpa-by-adoption\\", and when he came to play Kansas City or Chicago, we'd spend a couple of days together. His bandmates would be hunting up girls, (I was already married), while Hook and I would glance at old movies or a ballgame on TV, and just talk, for hours.<br /><br />George's \\"Early Takes Volume 1\\" brings back all those memories. I share some of these with you here, so that you might understand what it's like to have a hero/musician share his art and life with you, and, therefore, why this album carries extra meaning for this writer.<br /><br />The day we met, \\"Hook\\" played songs for me backstage, when we were the only two in the room. When he was writing new material, he'd sing it for me, over the phone, (He in CA, and I in KS). Better still, he never failed to call me on my December birthday, and sing with that voice that defines his genre, \\"Happy Birthday\\" to me. Amazing. Quickly! Find his Grammy-winning album, \\"The Healer\\", or his \\"I'm in the Mood\\" duet with Bonnie Raitt, and you'll understand. Trust me.<br /><br />I was born with cerebral palsy in my legs, so walking long distances was hard. John Lee, out of consideration, gave me some incredible \\"help\\" for this.<br /><br />Whenever the concert promoter sent the limo to bring Mr. Hooker to his concert venue, John Lee made sure that I alone rode with him. (In part because, despite my legs, my upper body was \\"bodyguard\\" large. As such, I could make sure \\"Hook\\" didn't get shoved around in a crowd). I also got, not a backstage pass, but an on-stage pass, and a chair. This way, I could watch his whole show comfortably from the wings, and not battle huge crowds, such as the 450,000 that so joyously saw John Lee Hooker close the 1988 Navy Pier Blues Festival in Chicago.<br /><br />The hilarious part of this was, whenever I climbed out of a limo with \\"Hook\\", fans waiting backstage naturally assumed, especially given the longer hair and full beard that I wore back then, that I must surely be in the John Lee Hooker band. Despite my insistence to these fans that I was just John Lee Hooker's friend, they asked - even demanded - my autograph.  While laughing about this later, I asked John Lee what to do. He too, cracked up laughing. Then, with the charming, grandfatherly wisdom that was so typical of John Lee, he said, \\"Just keep the fans happy 'n sign for 'em, John. You ain't doin' any harm.\\" Since *nobody* can read my signature anyhow, I signed a few. Sorry, if by chance, any of those fans ever read this. My autograph's only good on a check! I only felt badly when someone made me sign a book on the same page as a signature from the great Bob Dylan. That seemed to me as a kind of rock 'n' roll sacrilege.<br /><br />If you're even a moderate Beatles/Harrison fan, you'll love this album. As most fans know, George was the most private of all The Beatles. To \\"peek behind the curtain\\" and see these great songs, as well as the unreleased gems, develop is indeed a treat! It's a damned shame that he had to die** before we got to hear them.<br /><br />**Cancer, from smoking, even though Mr. Harrison had quit years before. As was sung in, \\"I'm So Tired\\", \\"...and curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git!\\" Raleigh learned to smoke tobacco from American Indians, and so he introduced that deadly habit to Colonial America.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This was an fast-paced, action-packed, page-turner!  The writer, Damian Stevenson, created a scenario which ran through my imagination as clearly as if on the big screen, itself, and I loved it.  Although a historical read, it was entertaining, super fun and I truly couldn't put it down.  Highly recommended.  Now, where do I go to spy school??
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|After taking a marine biology class, this game seems even more fun! I like fish, &amp; learning and collecting different kinds I've never seen before is also enjoyable. ;)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is loads of fun I always enjoy these kinds of games that make me think, especially when they include these kinds of interesting challenges and bright colors colors. If you want an app you can enjoy again and again without consuming a huge amount of time than I strongly suggest downloading this.
B009KY5OGC|3.0|On the one hand, it's an excellent source of historical research, on the other, Every chapter seems to follow a pattern...after 75% of the book, you kinda know what's coming
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Enjoyed the interview style used for this book.  Appreciated the political, geographical, military and emotional view points.  The personal recounting of each experience drew me in and kept me invested in each person's actions, thoughts and how they survived.  I have always enjoyed post apocalyptic, survival stories and this is in my top 3.  Worth your time? Absolutely!
B004GYY714|4.0|It's very new (to me) So far, I like it, but I haven't used it much. I haven't had time to &#34;stretch it out&#34; yet. Ask me again in a couple of months..

B009XIXVU6|3.0|Having served in Afghanistan, I like Afghanistan stories..This one, like his other books, describes a facet of Afghani life..To that extent, I liked it..That being said, there was nothing outstanding..It was OK..Three stars describes it perfectly.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its a really cool game to play... so additive to play too!  Its a Not to hard and not to easy game also!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun, but not complete. I hate having to wait for a game to be finished. I hope the rest of the game is as good as the first part!
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|It could have been a good book...it had a good base, however, the characters and storyline were underdeveloped and contradictory.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|In his disarming, charming, lyrical style, encouraging us to move forward for the love of his cast of fictional beings, Khaled Hosseini has soared as his kites!!!
B008TRUDAS|3.0|The reviews were so good that I felt I had to read this book but I was very disappointed. I'm not sure where all the great reviews came from. The best thing about the boom was the poetry.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Awesome book!  Couldn't put it down!  Great characters, great story line!  The movie was good too but would recommend the book first.
B000FC146C|5.0|I read this many years ago and the writing and characters are memorable today. It's on my must re-read list.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so fun me and my sister got this game and some levels it took both of our minds to open the elevator. after we finally got through all ten levels we challenged eachother to see who could remember how to open the doors the fastest. The only flaw i found is that there isnt enough levels after you reach ten levels then the game is pretty much useless. Overalll this is the best game i ever got and i cant wait for the rest of the levels to come. To everyone who is interested in this game hurry up and download it  i mean its a free app.!!!!!
0062238868|5.0|If you're looking for a riveting, Hollywood account of war, don't read this book!!!  It is not written in a high-intellect or highly polished format.  Comments from those looking for such an account can be found in the 1 and 2 star categories.  However, if you want to see the reality of war from the perspective and in the language of those actually involved in it, this is an excellent read.  It isn't written from the perspective of a general or reporter who is detached from the conflict, but from the perspective and view of those in the thick of it.<br /><br />American Sniper is more like a documentary than entertainment, and should be approached as such.  At times it can seem to be a bit repetitive, but I believe that shows some of the reality of the situation.  It gives insight into the family and emotional conflicts that I have witnessed from service members deployed for extended periods; a struggle that most Americans can not relate to.  Chris & Taya Kyle are open about these in this book and really show that war is hell... even on the home front.  The struggles of service members' families are often overlooked.<br /><br />The political debates about the war, which are valid, are not the point of this book.  While Chris' views, I believe, are made clear, they are his, because this is his story.  It isn't important that we agree with his views, but it is important to see and understand where they come from.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft very much but this doesn't have any caves or lava or tons of stuff but it is still really fun :D
B000A59PMO|5.0|I had heard a lot about this show and was curious to watch it and took a chance by buying it when I only saw the first episode. However that said, this is a very fresh show with interesting takes on social class and high school life. Can't wait to watch season 2!!!
B00D41H2PS|2.0|difficult. no help. no helpful hints. and not very interesting. but what can you expect from a cheap little game.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My kids like it but at four and six they are too young to read the dialogue betweeen nemo and his dad so i have to play with them. It is a bit advanced for them.

B000V39KDO|4.0|This is a good movie. It isn't a great movie. It has a lot of action. There is very little story or subtext.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|This was some movie! Incredible casting and acting! Just a &#34;must&#34; see! But why is there NO digital copy available with BluRay? I would like this in my iTunes as well, for travel.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I can stream from my cloud to my smart phone.  Don't have to download to the phone and use memory.  Don't have to carry another piece of equipment like my MP3 player.
B004FEFS5E|2.0|I think this is really geared to beginning photographers.  Since I've been shooting for about 50 years, I don't fit that catagory.
B0094LZY2A|5.0|Great movie! Our entire family enjoyed it. We even watched it again the next day. Highly recommend it to anyone who wasn't watched it before.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|My wife and I read all three books in Ms. Collins' trilogy. We both liked the plot and character development throughout, although the heroine's perverse stubbornness was annoying on occasion.
0307277453|5.0|An actually interesting book, with bits of humor thrown in to keep it from being too dry. Includes some illustrations and graphs.
0142410705|4.0|This book, is probably the least favorite of the John Green books I read, even though I very much enjoyed this story.<br /><br />This is the least cohesive story of his, and is a lot more round about in it's ways than \\"Looking for Alaska\\" or \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" It takes a lot longer to get into, and the end doesn't feel as satisfying as any of the others that I have read. I feel bad for saying so many negative things, but I feel like this book could have been dissected into a few different stories, because of all of the content piled into this book.<br /><br />Having said all of that, It was an enjoyable read, it had many interesting tidbits of information spaced throughout, and John Green writes with an incredible voice and detail that immerses yourself into the world of this book, even if the story is moving at a snails pace.

B000063DIH|3.0|There is some good songs: Be Quick or Be Dead, Weekend Warrior, Judas Be My Guide.<br /><br />Then there is some bad songs: Afraid To Shoot Strangers, Childhood's End, The Apparition, Chains of Misery.<br /><br />Very uneven album, expected better. The sound is okay, the lyrics sound cartoonish.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|amanda is very good in this one-if you're bored on a saturday night or for a dreary rainy day-watch it!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|One flaw: Bane. Bane is basically a humongous steroid user, Hardy did what he could but it wasn't enough for me. The other thing, he got defeated by the silliest of ways, a man who's supposed to be humongous and strong, defeated very weakly.<br /><br />Another flaw: Catwoman. Hathaway was half way good but was nowhere close to Pheifer. Sadly it could have been better to have casted someone else instead of her.<br /><br />Other than that, good but not as spectacular as the first two.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|Love this series.  Couldn't wait for the next to arrive so I could see the next season, it's for everyone
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|Since this hasn't been released yet, of course I don't have this product. All I can say about it is: The title of episode #4, \\"Oeuf,\\" is misspelled.<br /><br />Easily the best show on network television. Don't miss out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I doubt there will ever be a character as flawed and lovable as CTG. As much as I want to stab my eyes out to Ana's inner goddess and as long as I live I hope to never see the words \\"holy cow\\" or \\"holy crap\\" again, as much as I hate the word \\"replete\\" & \\"apex\\" or \\"sardonic\\".... This book forever has a piece of my heart. [I hope I never cave and watch the movie, bc I've learned from twilight the chosen actors for each roll have a way of overpowering the beauty of the characters in your imagination. I don't ever want my view of Christian tainted by film.  Unattainable perfection is just that- unattainable.]  I would highly recommend this book to anyone that wants a heartbreakingly precious and flawed love story. His flaws and her \\"ordinary-ness\\" somehow create a love that endures your heart forever.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|After reading For Whom The Bell Tolls many years ago in high school, I was eager to read another Hemingway book.  We also read The Paris Wife in our book club and I enjoyed reading about Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley.  I was somewhat surprised at the different style of writing in Hemingway's books.  Our book club gave this book a three out of five stars.
B0094M4OW0|4.0|The streaming of this video was good. It ran smoothly with no buffering and the sound was very good at all times
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written. A sad story of interwoven lives that keeps the reader involved from beginning to end. Hosseine amazes again.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|It is a good game for those who like competing against others.  If you spend your workday doing the same, then you probably want to relax more with a solo-based game.  Either way this is always fun.  The tutorial is a great idea.
1451695195|5.0|As a neurosurgeon who explains every detail of his experience from the onset of his sudden illness to his near-miraculous recovery and his research afterward, Alexander is a very convincing narrator. Every &#34;near-death experience&#34; I've read about has been different, which is to be expected since every person is a unique individual. Alexander's is the first I've read that includes a dark and rather frightening period before he makes his way to the heavenly light, but I'm sure it's not unique to him. It reminded me of the warnings in The Egyptian Book of the Dead--you may be frightened by the tiger, but continue, because it is not a real tiger. Our minds create our perceptions, which is as true in &#34;real life&#34; as it seems to be in the afterlife. Fascinating book.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Heard bad things about this moive, but it goes to show you that you shouldn't always listen to what other people say... This was an awesome movie! Everything from the acting and fight scenes, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't mind a little ass kicking and some bad ass sibling team up!
B0095P31L6|4.0|This was a fun movie for a group of all ages! I would recommend it to families with kids of different ages and adults.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was recommended to me.  I loved it...800+ pages but we'll worth it.  He also brings back old characters from other works.  Enjoy
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great movie for my age bracket especially! I have already watched it several times and recommended it to my friends.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Due to the extreme popularity of the book I expected it to be pretty good, but was very disappointed. It's just another trendy thriller that isn't particularly well-written.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Gotta say, these are well planned and fascinating story lines.  Despite my usual dislike of science fiction, I'm hooked. Well done.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|West Coast stoner rock royalty returns with their 7th album--QOTSA are back with a record that<br />  shows a more varied tempo, at times almost playful, approach.  There's an overall lessened<br />  emphasis on \\"heavy\\", more concentration on song structure, which gives the album an<br />  expansive, mature feel.  The rhythmic leanings toward occasional post-funk power-chord riff rock<br />  sometimes recalls Led Zeppelin's \\"Houses of the Holy\\".  Overall, it plays out like a logical<br />  progression for the band.  I think the songs are a bit less memorable and the album lacks<br />  consistency, compared to their previous releases--but the Josh Homme touch of reckless rock<br />  genius still permeates the music.  Members of the current lineup have played with Kyuss, Foo<br />  Fighters, Mondo Generator, Nirvana, Them Crooked Vultures, Mini Mansions, Failure, Wires On<br />  Fire, A Perfect Circle, more.  Contributors include members from the Distillers, Screaming Trees,<br />  Arctic Monkeys, Nine Inch Nails, Scissor Sisters, James Lavelle & Elton John!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Lots of fun. No learning curve. You can buy coins with real money but you also earn a lot so you can really feel like you're making progress. A great game.
0451232852|5.0|WOW! I love love love this book!!! This is the first Follett that I have ever read (pretty gutsy for starting with a trilogy) and not a stand alone novel. I have a great interest in historical fiction, and this novel did not disappoint in the least. This is one of the best books I have EVER read! I so into this trilogy now, that I have already purchased book two (Winter of the World) without being finished with this one (currently on page 612). The characterizations are spot on. I am drawn into this novel everytime I pick it up. I can smell the smoke of the guns, I can feel the pain of the soldiers and their families. I NEVER read books more than one time...EVER, this one (when time goes by) I may consider reading this again. Detail is right there. I cannot wait to read book 2....<br /><br />Christopher Berry
1885167776|5.0|\\"Going small is ignoring all the things you could do and doing what you should do. It's recognizing that not all things matter equally and finding the things that matter most.\\"  Gary Keller with Jay Papasan<br /><br />This is one of the most impactful quotes to me in the the entire book and it has started to change my whole line of thinking in business, in marriage, in friendships and in life.  This book was a great read the first time through but I'm on my 2nd read now and it has the potential to change lives!<br /><br />I began teaching some of the content from the book at my church to a 20 and 30 year old's group that I participate in and the content has been just as impactful to my church friends as it has to my business friends.<br /><br />This is a book about focus.  It's a book about removing the noise and focusing on what really matters.  It's a book about extraordinary results.  It's a book that will cause you to look at how you're living your life and how you can go produce bigger, better results with some small tweaks!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This show is awesome. From the crimes they solve to everyones personal life it is a show you want to just keep on watching.
B0061QD82E|5.0|This is one of the best disney animated films and now being on blu-ray it's refreshed.  It's cleaned up, great picture and sound as well as a lot of extras.  It's stood the test of time and kids young and old will love it.  I highly recommend it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I can't decide if the story line is depressing or uplifting, but it was still an enjoyable book! It makes you look at flowers in a different way knowing they have &#34;meaning&#34; or a story to tell all by themselves.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This blu-ray release is awesome.  There's the digital copy for a few different digital providers.  It's amazing how well animated it looks and the 3d is done very well.  It's great for the family and does a good job explaining to kids, pets can't stay forever
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Knowing someone hiking the trail right now gives the book more meaning. It was easy to get caught up in the adventure.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Addictive and fun brain game for all ages. Some boards are more challenging, but that keeps interest going to get all three stars. This game is a must have. I hope more levels are coming soon. Chech out their Cut the Rope games. I have all three and they are great fun too.

B00CN8U60Q|5.0|I might be considered a fan of Blackmore's Night and have just about all of their music.  This album is no exception to the enjoyable quality of their music!  The album is truly a valued addition to my collection.
B00AK57N00|5.0|This game is a good quick game to pick up and start playing almost anywhere the music is good and the controls are simple.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|Some reviewers mention that people who fought in this theater of WW2 don't like this fictional movie.  Yet Viet Nam vets all seem to like \\"Apocalypse Now\\", which is even more fictionalized.  This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
B00683JLXA|1.0|Angry Birds rip off. The controls are just about the same the graphics are not very good and you can finish some levels with out even shooting a Panda...
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|This is a great lil Dr Panda App. My lil guy loves to mix the colors to make a different color. He loves to fix things so this a perfect one for him. I love all the Dr panda apps!
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I had my reservations when I heard that the story was about kids fighting each other to the death. Oh - and by the way it's PG-13 so 13 year old kids can be entertained by kids killing each other. But it's popularity was overwhelming so I figured I should still see what all the fuss was about. While the action, acting and sets were pretty good the movie confirmed my suspicions about what my heart already knew. This isn't what movies are about. Kids and teens dying is a no-no in film and who the hell needs or wants to see it? On a good and bad note I will say that the violence was not glamorized. There was no overly graphic scenes. Most violence happened so quickly you couldn't really see what happened even though you just knew what did. I guess that's how they got the PG-13 rating which annoys me more than the plot of the movie. It's a cheap way to get a young crowd.<br /><br />What's next - off screen porno sex for G rated movies? It wasn't for me and anyone else with a conscience. Sorry HG lovers.
0646497855|5.0|nice..simpliefied..thank you..
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My overall impression of this book is that it is highly readable, could hardly put it down! The author exposes much of his personal life and journey, mostly seems authentic in doing so. His coma experience is certainly one that I have been waiting for since Raymond Moody opened this line of study in the late seventies. I believe that Dr. Alexander has moved the conversation/debate ahead a notch, we are all better for having this work in the public domain. He will certainly be giving us more of this reflective study in the future, and I look forward to reading everything he writes. His spiritual and theological language is clearly resourced in the Robert A. Monroe group that he contacted after his experience. It would be fascinating to here his own vocabulary describing the Core and the Gateway. I have already recommended this book to others.
B0012Z361C|5.0|good dvd..thank you

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has done it again.  He has the ability to draw you in to people's lives and make you see their environment without being overly descriptive.  I don't know how he does it, but he hits just the right note.  Like his previous books, this story will stay with you after you've finished reading.  Don't miss it!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed reading Dead Ever After. The writing was early Charlaine Harris. That is, it was so good I didn't  want to put it down! A great finish to a great series. Thank you Charlaine for staying true to Sookie!

B002NN5F7A|5.0|What would you do to if gaining that one sale meant the difference between keeping your job or losing everything?  This movie shows you how four men had to struggle with that very issue.  Over the course of two-days we get an insight into what each of these men struggles with internally to ensure that one more sale is theirs.  At the end of this movie you'll be forced to take a good long look at your own life and asked yourself - just how far is to far for success - Steve
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I think the game is good but really really hard and I spent most catherine guessing till I got it right
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|It's probably the 20th time that I read it since it was first published in Brazil (1987).<br /><br />I love it.  The plot is amazing, the art is suberb and this time te colors are even better.

0062255657|4.0|Neil Gaiman was asked to write a short story by science-fiction editor and publisher Jonathan Strahan.  As the text grew, the author had to admit to himself that he had let it become a novel instead.  As such, it retains the economy of expression found in short stories (\\"rounded and perfect like so many eggs,\\" as described by Italo Calvino) while exhibiting the character development one looks for in a novel.<br /><br />Ocean at the End of the Lane is a visual and visceral rural horror story that is rooted in the distrust children can feel about the adult world.  In a harrowing chase sequence at the book's center, the seven year old hero is cornered and describes the evil Ursula Monkton: \\"She was power incarnate, standing in the crackling air.  She was the storm, she was the lightning, she was the adult world with all its power and all its secrets and all its foolish casual cruelty.  She winked at me.\\"  The wink is a perfect last touch by Gaiman as he paints a picture in four short words of the disdain the adult world shows for the young man's defiance.  This is typical of the language the author employs to create a climate of dread as he briskly moves the plot along.<br /><br />Just as in the movie Invaders from Mars, this novel does not provide the comfort of parental protection.  Monkton uses the adult weapon of sex to turn his father against the boy, whose only protection are his eleven year old neighbor (of indeterminate age) and an otherworldly kitten.  There remains a generational  undertone to the supernatural conflict in the book: \\"Ursula Monkton was an adult.  It did not matter, at that moment, that she was every monster, every witch, every nightmare made flesh.  She was also an adult, and when adults fight children, adults always win.\\"  This makes the horror in the book both more real and more nuanced, drawing, as it does, on the terrors of the child inside each adult.<br /><br />Ocean at the End of the Lane is a short but very enjoyable read.  Charactersand setting are plundered from the landscape of Gaiman's childhood and come alive quickly for the reader.  The action is fast and the horror curiously believable.  Neither too violent for older children nor too cute for adults, this book is perfect for summer or late night reading.
044654759X|5.0|This book came perfectly packaged and quick. I really enjoyed reading it.  Definitely a great book to take down the shore this summer...it's a light read.  I also watched the movie & although it can't compare, it was also pretty good.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I haves loved these books for the start and have all of them. But this is a very weak ending to the story of sookie, who dates vampires and has fairy blood.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I personally think that this game is awesome and that it does not need any work besides the fact  that every time you hit the gas you flip so I think you should just tone it down a bit.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|LOVE it! It fits everything, all my lenses and accessories! Perfect product, makes the ease of everything together and organized!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I am a big fan of male POV, so for this book to be 100% from his perspective I was really excited to read.  And I wasn't disappointed.  This book was so, so funny.  The relationship development was realistic and the banter between characters had me laughing out loud.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a very fun game but I think there could be a few updates like I think you should be able to change skins, you should be able to save other peoples worlds. I think its a great game already but I could be better
B004SIP7TE|5.0|Good story.  It is a historical movie showing how Tammany Hall &#34;worked&#34;.  Great acting and lots of action.<br />Noticed the &#34;Twin Towers&#34; at the end.
1451696191|5.0|I hadn't originally  given this book a chance as a result of  the journal style it was written in, just didn't appeal to me. But after watching the movie I decided to give it a shot. Chbosky is brilliant, and incredibly skilled at evoking emotions. It's a relatively short book, something you can probably finish in an afternoon's time. But worth the read.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It was enchanting, intriguing, and frustrating.  I loved the characters, loved the plot, but the ending left me drifting.  I would like to see more of this story.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|I was surprised to be able to see the movie at all<br />it was very good quality and very little buffering as i live far out of the<br />city

B009CF7JDU|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time.  I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said.  I have probably watched this movie 100 times in my life, and it's funny every time.  I would put this up there with the likes of Animal House and Caddyshack on my list of top movies.  Bueller, Bueller, Bueller....

Charlie Sheen, Renee Russo, Tom Berenger, Wesley Snipes, Bob Euker(sp?), Corben Bernsen (sp?), that black guy from 24 and the Allstate commercials, just off the top of my head.  Wild Thing, You Make My Heart Sing!  LOL
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The camera is adequate but the picture quality is average at best.  It is difficult to use with the Kindle Fire and the front facing lens.  You have to take the photo looking behind you so no action shots with this camera.
B0091REZMW|5.0|its a great game for Facebook however i think its more of a kids game more then anything because there is a very short list  of items u need to find  also all the list of items in the rooms are the same even though the list of items are scattered

B003B02O14|1.0|What a letdown!  The novel was great until the kick in the stomach ending when the protagonist loses everything.  After reading two otherwise well-crafted Grisham novels in a row with unhappy endings, The Chamber and now The Partner, I am ready to cross John Grisham off my list of favorite authors.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|It was just about as entertaining as a bottle rocket...exciting till you get to the boom. Nothing fancy! I wouldn't waste your money if I were you.
193700788X|3.0|After reading all the unhappy reviews, I was expecting something really awful. It was better than I expected, not Game of Thrones twisted and painful, but not a total failure. I must admit that I never imagined myself in Sookie's place, I guess \\"none of the above\\" would have been my team. But I think Ms. Harris must have been influenced by Walking Dead, otherwise why turn one of the lovers into a zombie?... It wasn't really a \\"happily ever after\\" ending, I think in that regard Ms. Harris was fair to her creations. But most of the surviving cast of characters ended up in reasonable shape. It was meant to be an adventure, and not a self-improvement project, so scarred but older and wiser is an acceptable outcome. I do agree Ms. Harris seemed to want to move on to other stories, that she had spun things out farther than she might have intended and, for this last book, just didn't want to create any new villains but instead wanted to close the open brackets and tie off most of the loose ends. I wanted a little more of a ride, maybe not a drop coaster but more than the wee kiddies' version, but it was nice to visit with the familiar characters. I suppose it's better that Ms. Harris doesn't try to draw this out like the Magic Tree House or Hardy Boys series.
B000FS9FC6|4.0|This is one of my favorites, and when I found it offered for a cheap price I had to add it to my DVD collection. It was used, but in good condition and for a great price.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Put this on my Kindle for when grand kids go with me some where.  Just too cute and fun even for &#34;big&#34; girls like me.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|This is a delightful film, beautifully shot and with stellar performances. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but those who enjoy the film will likely find it entirely memorable and want to watch it over and over again. Audrey becomes instantly lovable as Amelie, and the film is an overall treat.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Fantastic must see for any WWII fan, not your typical unrealistic war movie, great view into the life on a Uboat.
B002AT8KB0|4.0|A great second movie. Liked it almost as much as the first one.A great story continuing the series. The other movies  after where not as good.
B004LWZW7O|3.0|Sometime in this dystopian future we are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25, and then we get just one more year to live.  There's a giant countdown clock on our arm telling us exactly how many years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds we have left.  We can work to earn more time.  We can give time with others.  We can STEAL time from others.  We can horde time on aluminum blocks that are like bank accounts.  Time is currency, but when you go bankrupt, you're DEAD.  Some are fabulously \\"rich\\" with more time than they can ever use while most suffer in \\"poverty\\" with only a day's worth of time to their name.<br /><br />What could possibly go wrong with a great premise like that???<br /><br />Here's what: after an intriguing opening and a great first act, this movie disintegrates into mindless car chases, fights, and cliches, and utterly fails to live up to its great potential.  A real shame.<br /><br />Maybe they'll release a \\"directors cut\\" that removes a half hour of unnecessary plot diversions and hones this to the great work it could have been.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I purchased this for my girlfriends autistic son who is 13. This one is very difficult so I would recommend an easier model for autistic teenagers but I love the product just the same.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I read this book ages ago.  Found it very informative and actually embarassing at the way the Indian population was treated, to this day actually.  I think it should be required reading in schools.  We all need to know our history, yet it seems to be lost in this technology age.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Khaled Hosseini third novel is alluring even though it may have a familiar sense to his writing. He remains a great storyteller and the  vivid description of the settings and his characters is sure to intrigui his fans so far.By now his fans have a clear picture of the social and political background of Afganistan , and this novel further enhances that. However there seems to be too many characters this time around and I felt miffed keeping up with each of them or placing their importance in the novel.<br />However the story will hold the readers attention to the end when there is an expectation of sweet conclusion even though leaving heartwrenching after taste.<br /><br />It is a must for all the authors fans!
B00296A4F4|4.0|The music in the show is very good and the acting is also very good. I would be happy to watch other episodes.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I Loved the movie, I loved the soundtrack. It had all my favorite moments from the movie in the cd. What's not to love?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it!  Don't know why I waited so long.  Good character development.  You really care about these people and are anxious to see what happens to them.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great time passer game. It's a matching game like bejeweled that lets you advance in levels. I like that it's seems never ending.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven<br />Very interesting book.  After reading the book, he made me a believer that there is life after death.  I loved the book.
0517642913|5.0|The format is perfect, the hardbound covers and gilded edges look nice. There is nothing more I could want from this book.
0316789720|5.0|As an adult with nieces and nephews, this has been a great book both for writing letters and having them draw from it. There are lots of fun figures to draw, and even someone as untalented as me can follow the directions and make passable figures. A good buy!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|You need to really concentrate when watching this delightful movie. The main characters are a joy to watch.<br />Watch it again to make sure you understand and did not miss anything. It causes you to think.
6304698526|5.0|What is not to like with one of the great movies and action scenes. Then toss in Steve McQueen. Wow
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|Older kids would like this film because its animation and evolves around a boy & his dog.<br />Adults might not think it is so fun to watch.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I was a big fan of the original Die Hard and the second one.  Even though the third Die Hard went down hill and was not as good as the first two, I bought this fourth Die Hard and it continued the downward trend and I can not recommend purchasing this one --- I grew up in the 60's and this is of the quality that would have been shown in the second run theater.
B005FISBTO|1.0|Huge Dexter fan, have loved every season so far, until I reached season 6. I'm not sure what happened with the writers, but it's like they took a vacation and let the interns handle things for the year. Everything about this season is just \\"Off\\" The story is limp, the Religous theme is lame, the caharacters act way out of character and say and do things they would have never done previously. Angel and Quinn smoking pot? Dexter shooting a gun off in the middle of the night while speeding? His brother suddenly appearing for an episode without reason? I had to force myself to watch all the episodes, it was that bad. Deb falling in love with Dexter??? WTF??? Just all bad, except for the final scene. Just started Season 7 and in one episode it was already better than the entire 4 discs of this waste of time, ugh.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Well it took long enough but finally the essence of superman was captured on film. Times have changed since the 1970s<br /> Mr.Reeves  did a great job but this is 2013. this is why the Brandon Routh version flopped because it was made with today's cgi but a 1970 style superman. with Man Of Steel all is corrected Amy Adams rocks as always as Does Cris .M from law and order henry .C makes a good superman as well. looking forward to the sequel etc........
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a great game and generally easy. I just wish there were more levels when you first get it because it is addictive!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game, add more levels!!! Ten is not enough! I Beat all the levels within an hour, it works good on my Kindle
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game . It's fun to do everything with my horse. Keep up the great work and have a nice day!<br /><br />(: Emma Maly
B000FCK65W|5.0|Nostalgia reigns because this was a favorite of my mom´s....and now I have it on hand on my kindle.  It is a tale that can be adapted to this day and age.....as well as taking me back to the real life time when my mom was reading it.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I have tried stylus pens like the Samsung S pen and generic pens.  So far, none of these have compared to the accuracy and responsiveness of the Amazon stylus. If you are considering a stylus for your kindle fire hd, Microsoft surface, touchscreen computer, cell phone or even touch screen video game system....this is the stylus for you!  Cheap and super effective. Will buy another soon!
B007JCP8FE|5.0|best 8 bucks I've spent in a long time. Can't go wrong .Been waiting for this album and it does not disappointed.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|It was somewhat disjointed and thus lost impetus.  I wouldn't recommend it as a book to read before you go to sleep - it needs more concentration to keep track of who fits in where.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|The APU is great for 720p gaming ( and some games at 1080p ) I purchased this for my brothers first build so we can play games together ( consoles are just dying out ) and he's happy with the performance getting that sweetspot of 30+ fps. I would recommend this for any entry gaming build as this is both a cpu and gpu,  for the price you cannot beat this APU.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This is a fun and exciting listen, love the theme and all the other tracks especially terraforming. Seeing the movie and hearing this score was awesome. Other favorite tracks include look to the stars, launch, flight, what are you going to.... and arcade. A must have.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fairly challenging game.  The first few levels are easy, but they get progressively more challenging.  I can't wait for more levels!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|after getting the new update I put Octavia in canterlot. but when I did this 3 of them spawned and when I clicked on her house three octavias live there and their not changelings plaza fix this bug
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|i would recommend this book to all friends and family it is so addicting i love it i hope you like it to
B00D2K40WY|5.0|awesome and amazing.it is the best game ever<br />everyone should play it.<br />every girl wishes for a dress up game
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This book was great.i loved the whole series.i hope more are coming soon. This book is great. For Tweens who are interested in law and realistic fiction. I recommend this book to young readers
B005544TRQ|5.0|Tired of all the depressing stuff.  This was a refreshing change.<br />TV needs less of the gore and more of fun and good over evil.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Fantastic! I could not put this down, and have already loaned it to 5 friends! I know I won't be going to the movie, there's no way this book can be turned into a 2 hour film!
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Flawless acting and lots of fun watching fashions, furnishings, and technology of England pre-WWII. I would highly recommend this series.
B00821OX98|5.0|I enjoyed watching season 1 very much.  Can't wait to start watching season 2.  I stream this using my Roku and the episodes come through flawlessly!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I played this with one other person. It was fun for awhile, then got a little old. But I especially enjoyed how you could see the guesswork that the other person had to go through in order to figure out your drawing.
B000026KG7|5.0|What artwork!  On this the 3rd album by Deep Purple, Rod Evans, Jon Lord, Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Paice and Nick Simper produced another gem.  Nice opening track \\"Chasing Shadows\\", the psychedelic-pop of \\"Blind\\", really like the modern jazz playing by Jon Lord, Blackmore also gives a stand up job too.  Donovan's \\"Lalena\\",  Rod Evans vocals are fantastic, nice cover.  \\"Fault Line/The Painter\\", one of my favorites from early Deep Purple, Blackmore's guitar work is freakin' great, Lord's organ and Ian Paice's drumming is tops. this should be played on every classic rock station!  \\"Bird Has Flown\\", with that funky beginning, almost reminds me of  Evans' Captain Beyond.  Another solid effort here, after this album bassist Nick Simper and vocalist Rod Evans would be fired, months later in came Ian Gillan and Roger Glover from Episode Six.  Next studio album would be \\"In Rock\\", for 1970.  A big change in direction for the band.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Really do love the drama between Peter, his mom and Alicia. Competition is always a good thing at Lockhardt Gardner.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|there are only ten rooms. that was a bit dissapointing. more rooms are promised in future. I really hope this is true. I enjoy these find games.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Best Item I have ever bought from amazon.Fire lights fast  and no  messy lighter fluid.looks like it will last for years too
B000F3AAUW|3.0|I just wanted a couple of cuts. I was curious. I like 'Crazy' by Cee Lo Green. Sorry the rest of the songs didn't move me. But I could appreciate the art that went into it. No problem. There's something for everybody.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging but not too challenging. It is very fun. You have to go through each level using tools and objects to find codes and passwords to unlock boxes, doors, ect. The objective is to get out of the room and into the next one through the elevator. The elevator is always locked. VERY FUN
0521179211|2.0|By mistake I bought the book without answers, and what should I do now???<br />How can I check my answers now?! What about the audio?! What in earth do you guys publish a book without answers and a CD audio?! Even if I was taking an IELTS course with a teacher correcting the answers, it doesn't make any sense... I can't return the book because I live in Brazil...  Too bad again...
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I am not quite finished reading it, but it has kept my vivid attention. It is perfect King style. I cannot wait to see what happens in the end. I recommend this book 1000%. You will not be sorry. This is one of those books that read long into the night. Keep em coming SK. :-)
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I've just completed watching this version of Jane Eyre. I'm a little disappointed. I've read the book and seen countless movie adaptations. A movie never does a book justice, so I was not expecting this from this version. However, I thought I would enjoy it, because it is \\"Jane Eyre.\\" In my opinion, this version didn't put much effort into character development, and for me to enjoy a movie, I need to be emotionally connected with the characters. Also, there didn't seem to be much chemistry between the main characters, another \\"must\\" for me especially in a romance. Masterpiece Theatre's 2007 version is by far the best version in my opinion. I cared about the main characters, and the chemistry between them developed strongly through the film. If you are like me and want to see every version, then watch it and make your own assessment. However, if you haven't seen a movie version of Jane Eyre and are looking for the best, go with the 2007 version. You wont be disappointed.
B005T87QCI|3.0|It's an ok app... the gameplay is great and all, but if u wanna buy a robot or something u have to pay real money! Don't be deceived, cause it says that u can make a custom robot, but u have to pay! Just sayin'!
B0018S6YO4|5.0|I love rihanna's music and have loved every single cd I order.  All her songs are good and she is so talented.
B00821OX98|5.0|Burned through this season in a day. Only show I'm watching right now :-) you gotta give it a try!
B00915G6WQ|4.0|But not the greatest season of Dexter.  I felt like it was filler.  Deb did have one of my all time favorite Deb swears, though, lol! Excitedly waiting for the final season!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show is phenomenal. The acting is perfect.<br /><br />The show is obviously going to have its fair share of gore (it's a crime drama about a cannibal for Pete's sake), but the real focus is on the dynamics between the characters.<br /><br />Definitely not for the faint of heart, but for those who can stomach everything being people (especially Hannibal's cooking which is basically and upsettingly food porn), I highly suggest it.
B0089Q1TPM|4.0|Mel Brooks directs & stars in this 1987 comedy that also stars Bill Pullman,<br />John Candy, Daphne Zuniga and Rick Moranis. A space bum and his<br />sidekick help rescue a princess and try to save her planet in this sci-fi<br />spoof. This is a good film that's one of my favorites from Brooks with<br />a great cast. This Blu-ray has nice picture and sound plus neat extras.<br />I recommend this 80's classic.
B008OOYALE|5.0|love this game im on it every day love it only bad part it the waiting but beside that is awesome
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This app works G R E A T !! My whole staff can scan from their desk, email the doc and upload it into our computer system!
B0015SYKCU|5.0|The quality and sound are excellent. The record are heavier than they used to be.  This is a great remaster and so wonderful to have the album cover and inserts.  Why did we ever collectively agree to give up the album?  What a loss.  So glad to see that they are coming back.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Great older movie from my youth was even better in blu ray. I was totally amazed. My kids loved it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I think I have read all his books and have enjoyed each of them. Well crafted, informative, and the part that makes it so good is that he tells a story so well.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Crashes every time I try to run it. I get the splash screen and a brief flash of the notice others have mentioned and then it goes black.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I was not very happy that the doctor was being replaced once more but I have to give it to the producers of the show, they made an excellent choice again. Also Karen Gillan is a great actress that fits perfectly as a Doctor companion. I highly recommend this series.
B007IV11PM|5.0|Matt Smith as the Doctor bring his own unique contribution to the many incarnations.  Very funny, touching, and engaging. Series follows a new storyline regarding his latest companion and almost every episode adds to the mystery.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked that this game was challenging but not difficult. I would recommend this game for people who don't consider themselves real gamers.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|i like this game and it is great but beware if u have Sims or something and u have a short attention span then this wouldn't be a perfect game for u.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Watched it with the kids (8, 6, & 4); the only thing I did not care for was the professor kissing every woman in the movie.  Seems hollywood can't make a movie now without introducing some sexuality. The timing of events is a bit off in relation to the &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;.  One must keep in mind that things develop in a dream state in both.<br />  The action was great, the storyline was nice, and the effects were fantastical yet believable.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I enjoy having this easy way of keeping track of the weather.  Live in Florida and it's a fast easy to keep in be updated.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Really slow than BAM! Totally leaves you hanging. Wouldn't be so bad if they were ready to release the next book right away but by the time they get around to that, we will have to re-read this one b/c it's not overly memorable.  Bummer
B008YKGQR4|4.0|the print is very small and hard to read much of the updates from friends posts.  It is ok,  need to work with it a little more.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|My grandson had been wanting this movie for a very long time and noticed that &#34;Amazon&#34; doesn't charge a tax and thought that was really grand so i ordered it and within days i received this movie and my grandson of which i have two have watched and watched and watched this movie and they LOVE IT LOTS , THANKS SO VERY MUCH AMAZON DON'T EVER ADD THOSE TAXES  IT SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE STORES !!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I don't feel like I'll ever get hooked on the game, but it's ok for play for a short time.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|great game it's epic brow get it you would love it so much you would play it or you would'nt
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|they need to give a few more coins to keep yea playing.  it's a free game that don't last very long with the few coins they give yea.
B0049GYXDG|3.0|I remember seeing this as a child and enjoying it then.<br />Now, not so much.<br />In fact, I kind of disliked it.<br />I do love the animation and art style though but the characters within it are the most annoying, irritating and obnoxious SOBs ever imagined.<br />Some of them so in need of a shotgun blast to the face.<br />Still, it is a cartoon made for children and so its an age-centric classic.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|You need to put attention a every single chapter ,to follow the drama if you lost a chapter then you are lost like the title of the movie.
B0013ND30W|5.0|You don't see too many classic Disney films in the wide screen format, so beautiful to behold.<br />The colours are clear, the forest scenes are my favourite and the music is still nice after all these years.<br /><br />:D
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I like this era of history and life on the primitive sailing ships.<br />great insight to a life on the high seas and politics of the time
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|The picture is beautiful, seen this years ago on an old VHS copy and it was quite dark, murky looking... seeing this cleaned up and looking better than it has in decades is a true marvel.<br />The classic animation is wonderful... great songs and silly elements.<br />Enjoy!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|one of the best movies I have seen in many years.  great performances, funny and uplifting.<br />had to have it so I could watch it every so often and feel better about mankind.
B001TH16DI|3.0|The picture quality in some of these is attrocious and distracting, these aren't the special editions transfers that were released on the two disc dvds from years past. These are the theatrical, warts and all versions. So beware!
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My 7 yr old daughter LOVES these two movies. I lost track on how many times she's watched it. Great story lines, great and interesting characters. I have no complains. I admit I am a fan of Monster High myself. Barbies are absolutely boring by comparison.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|New and interesting drama. Can't wait to watch the next episode. Love the main charaters. This show keeps you guessing.
B002ZG976U|1.0|it doesnt work,played for 5 min and stopped, It wouldnt start back, I know its a good movie, i&#34;ve seen it several times
B000J5XS3C|2.0|I've had one of these for 3-4 years and it's decent, but the master volume knob was always \\"scratchy\\" at low volumes. It's gotten worse and now some of the other knobs do the same. I haven't spilled anything and it is not used in a dirty or dusty environment and it does not travel. Behringer is known for using low quality potentiometers that do this. I think some of them also throw the balance off at lower volumes as the impedance \\"curve\\" doesn't seem to be the same for both channels of the potentiometers in some cases. I'm now looking to upgrade to perhaps a Yamaha mixer.<br /><br />The headphone out on this drives my Beyerdynamic DT990 250 ohm cans very well. It can get very loud and sounds pretty good. So that's good anyway. I use the bass and treble knobs and they work decently (there's a midrange adjustment too but I don't use that).<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this.
B009NX88JU|5.0|No words needed. Just take a moment to watch this instant classic and revel in the beauty that is music.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|It is significant that a medical practitioner comes to realize that life in matter, as we experience and know it, is not reality.  I was particularly moved by his conclusion that if one word had to describe true existence it would be &#34;love&#34;.  He also talks of &#34;consciousness&#34; as being all there is.  Quite a revelation!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This book was a lot of fun to read. There was a surface story of a man walking in the hope that a friend could be cured of cancer. During the walk interesting characters were encountered. There was also a deeper story as the characters contemplated their lives,  and relationships.
B000SLP4SE|3.0|I didn't start expecting much, but it was fairly good for an action film.still I pretty much always enjoy one man versus the authority films.
B003730LRY|4.0|I remembered this movie fondly from years gone by.  My eight-year-old loved it!  It was wonderful to have a family movie with very few expletives &#34;Damn&#34;.  And the violence is minimal( Compared to &#34;kid&#34; movies where characters are killed and blown up) and humorous (I think). (The daughter  Wednesday is hilarious.).
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Here's another game I downloaded into my kindle at my grandson's request.  He loved playing with it and we had fun connecting with his mom's kindle so we could play together.  Lots of fun!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I really like this version better than the previous one. The graphics are great, and the storyline is enjoyable, and very easy to follow.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I was hesitant  to get this app because I had a lot of problems with the first one but it has worked well and I can play my can  freely.
0061733199|5.0|Hard to beat this one for overall content, especially medical advice. This volume beats out all the others being offered.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very good game, I can play for hours.  My kids all liked it so much that they put it on their phones and tablets.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It's one of those shows, where you just want to see happens next.  Very well done.  Looking forward to watching the other seasons.
0307970299|1.0|I just did not like this book. I didn't get pass the 4th chapter. Was not what I expected.Will not read anything by this author again. This is just personal preference, but saying f this and f that on a constant basis doesn't make for good reading.
0061438294|2.0|I purchased this book with some hope that it was as good as the high-star reviews, after initially rejecting it for the low-star reviews. Then I saw a presentation of some of the content of this book and decided to buy it in spite of my reservations.  Shoulda saved my money!<br /><br />If you appreciate the new &#34;sell it&#34; style writing that says  &#34;tell them what you're going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you told them&#34; you won't mind this book, and might even find some interesting stuff in it.  I didn't really find much that I hadn't gotten from other body-read books/videos, and the writing style was gagging. I'm sure the author knows what he's talking about, he just chose a really poor presentation format.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; by Khaled Hosseini.  This is the first of his books I have read and now I want to read the others.  Not only is the story engrossing, but I learned a lot about the life of the very poor in Afghanistan and the effect of years of war on the people.  I was particularly interested in the part of the story about Afghanistan as it is today as a result of the ongoing American presence there.  This is an important book that, though fiction, contains a great deal of truth.  It made me realize how fortunate I am to live where I do and to understand a little more about a part of the world that is an unknown to most Americans.
B000AP04FG|4.0|They had good chemistry on screen.  A lot of action. It was tolerable. Acting was good. I don't regret purchasing it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Good movie but book was spectacular. Did a decent job portraying the book but when I saw this with someone who hasn't read the book I had to explains some things.
B00005R87Q|3.0|These movies are usually just okay to me.  The cars are always nice.  The storyline is okay and so is the acting.
B000VPEP0K|5.0|From the beginning to the end this film keeps you captive. A great period movie , with a strange take on the original book. What a great choice of actors, I was not disappointed with the film in anyway.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|If you like Star Trek it is nice to see the old shows again.  Some scenes appeared to re-mastered which makes the space shots more interesting.
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|Eric Clapton is great i wish he'd come out with new unplugged album. good quality and ni skips in my download
B00A6I87UQ|4.0|The material in the atlas is exceptionally good and very useful.  However, I am finding that the Kindle app on Android does not work well with the material.  It is not as easy as I had hoped to find and cross reference material.  What I get an updated version, I will likely go back to a book edition.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|[UPDATE]<br /><br />In addition to my original review (below), I wanted to point a couple of things out to other readers giving this and the other four books low ratings, and to provide a dose of fairness and perspective for prospective readers to consider.<br /><br />First, this is not the television series, it is a collection of books for \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" as written by George R. R. Martin before HBO turned them into the foundation for their own version known as \\"Game of Thrones\\" (a so-called \\"game of thrones\\" being a central subplot in the series of books). The stories told by the books and by the HBO series are similar but not necessarily the same. The books are far more detailed, allow for much more character development, and truly go into all of the history and dynamics of certain story lines, much of which the \\"Game of Thrones\\" shows cannot get into because they are limited to a dozen or so episodes per season with each episode being between 50 and 55 minutes based on how HBO runs things. The shows are not the same as the books; the shows are based somewhat loosely on the books; the shows leave a lot of important things out as far what the books contain; and, the books are not written so as to hold your attention for about one hour per week for several weeks out of the year (if they were, it would take you a couple of decades to read the books!). That being said, if you enjoy the show (it is a great show), stick with watching it until the HBO series' finale and then consider picking up and reading the books. Otherwise you will find yourself enjoying (or maybe not enjoying) two different stories that do have some similarities but leave you asking, \\"Why did HBO leave those characters out until now or why did they choose not to include that critical event?\\"<br /><br />Second, the books are not written so that every character is part of every chapter or every few chapters with one long continuous storyline. Martin says as much when he explains how he wrotethe books and why he chose to write them the way he did. Read all of what Martin writes and you will know this to be true (there's more than the Introduction, character chapters, and Epilogue to be read). If you focus only on the fact that each chapter is written from one character's point of view for a time that may have come before, during or after a previous chapter, then you will see the books only as a series of short stories involving related characters. However, if you pay attention to the details as you read the books, you will see little things explained or experienced by one character in a given chapter that relates to something that has been experienced or foretold by another character in a previous chapter so that all the chapters are tied back to a central storyline. This is how Martin has written the books, this makes it possible to develop an entire world full of many different characters in vivid detail, and this is what makes each book a true page turner (at least for me). If you did not enjoy this type of storytelling in the first three books (especially the third book), then why did you continue reading two more very long books for a story written in a way that you do not like?<br /><br />[ORIGINAL REVIEW]<br /><br />A fantastic fifth installment of the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. I have loved reading these five books. This series of books are now all in my Top Five favorites. I can only hope that Lord Martin sees fit to bestow gifts of early deliveries for the final two books in the series upon his leal and avid fans...<br /><br />If you have enjoyed the first four books as much as I did, this fifth one will not disappoint.
0425263991|5.0|As a reader and reviewer, one of the hardest things to deal with is the hype surrounding a particular book (or series). There are expectations to meet, which are sometimes set before the book is even written, and there is fear that the book cannot possibly do everything that readers believe it will do.<br /><br />I think this is definitely the case with Nalini Singh's Heart of Obsidian. The character of the Ghost has been prevalent throughout the Psy-Changeling series and, when it was revealed that he would be the focus of the next installment, the hype went through the roof. But, as difficult and impossible as it may seem, I strongly believe that this book met all of my expectations and so much more.<br /><br />Heart of Obsidian is a complex and dark story that takes an already wonderful series to the next level of awesomeness. The hero is one of the most dangerous I've read in a long time and I appreciated the fact that the author did not skimp out on showcasing this aspect of his character. With the heroine, Nalini Singh is in a unique position because so much of the hype has focused on the hero and she must be as fabulously written as he is, if not more. She excels at writing complex characters and I think these two are some of her finest creations.<br /><br />The love story in this book is surprisingly romantic despite the bleak overtones in the general plot. These two are perfect for each other and it is shown throughout how much they rely on another for emotional, physical, and moral support. I can do nothing but applaud Nalini Singh for how realistic she made certain aspects of this relationship. Things are not easy for this couple and she is not afraid to delve into the darker sections of this love story.<br /><br />As for the Psy-Changeling world, I have mentioned in most reviews for this series that the world building is one of the most well-written I've seen in paranormal fiction. Nalini Singh has thought out almost every aspect of this alternate world and it shows in every installment of the series. Heart of Obsidian continues that trend, but also shows that she has been planning on this resolution since the beginning.<br /><br />Overall, I was blown away by how wonderful this book was. Everything felt perfect to me from the characterization of the hero/heroine to the development of their romance to the continuation of the overall series story line. I am definitely impressed by Nalini Singh's talent (as always) and cannot wait to see where she takes the Psy-Changeling world now especially after that ending.nd it shows in every installment of the series.

0062255657|5.0|Before I get into this review let me admit something: I am a huge, huge Neil Gaiman fan (but really, who isn't?). That said, The Ocean at the End of the Lane quickly climbed to the top of my favorites list, not just favorites of Gaiman's work, but favorites of all time. It's that good. It also packs a punch for being as small of a book as it is - don't let its size fool you.<br /><br />Speaking of shorter novels, Gaiman does this so well. He doesn't add fluff and unnecessary bits of plot that do nothing other than bulk up the word count. He gets to the heart of the story and then, once he's led us there, he just twists and twists until his readers are so entwined into the story that it's nearly impossible to free ourselves. So I was grateful for the length of this book because it meant, after putting it down (finished), that I could finally go to sleep. But then.. came the dreams.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane tells the story of a grown man revisiting a place of his youth. It's filled with beautiful imagery, such as the birthday party of a 7 year old boy, that's designed to tug just right at the heart strings. It has myths and fantasies and a beautiful look at the power of the female that had me giddily clutching my book with happiness. The Ocean at the End of the Lane had all of this without overwhelmingly preaching a heavy-handed message. Instead, Gaiman tells a gentle story that has its share of horrors and happiness and, similar to Coraline and Neverwhere, the result is a fantasy world that I would love to visit.<br /><br />Chances are if you are reading this review, you already planned on picking up this book. But if, by chance, you are one of the few who has not experienced Gaiman's work, this would not be a bad place to start at all.

B0074PNCRM|5.0|A page turner - very captivating writing.  I read it in one sitting - very interesting, but a bit too depressing for my own personal taste.
0316228532|5.0|If you are getting this book because you loved Harry Potter, DON'T! If you are getting it because you wish to read a good story by a phenominal authur, DO!<br /><br />This is a heart wrenching true to life story of LIFE - Real, down to earth LIFE. It is set in a small town (which could fit anywhere really) and involves the upper class who don't want the lower class as part of there town. They try to turn a blind eye to the lower class. Ms. Rowling gives us (the reader) a true RAW look into what goes on behind the sceans of both the upper class (counsel members and family) and the lower class families. She holds nothing back and it is truly hear breaking and will make you think.<br /><br />My suggestion is to read this one with friends so that you have someone to discuss it with. Great book for book clubs.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This is the kind of film I would have enjoyed in my mid to late teens as it offers a gateway to some powerful messages wrapped in un-orthodox story telling and cool looking visuals, but honestly for people to elevate this movie to some sort of breathtaking experience of philosophical and spiritual significance is really surprising. either we have lost perspective or people just aren't willing or capable of delving into more abstract or complex subject matter. the more I think about this film and the sensation it left lingering in my brain the more I want to compare it to a lush Disney movie for adults.<br /><br />there are just too many cooky moments of ridiculousness and characters all over the place for me to take this film seriously. the car chase scene with Halle Berry's reporter character, the genetically engineered lady's cheesy love scene, all the forced make up on the actors to link these characters together. I cannot even imagine what it all looked like BEFORE hitting the editing room. this makes me want to read the book because the foundation and creativity for these stories is clearly artful, and kudos for trying so hard to bring them all to life. hollywood can and does make big fancy but thought provoking and intelligent films. Inception comes to mind or even something whimsical like Stranger than Fiction and I Heart Huckabees. movies like Cloud Atlas get lost in themselves and to me, I cannot say I was moved to any spiritual or humanistic realm. as for Buddhism, maybe if you teach a high school level English course and want to dissect various themes this would be great fare for that. as a thinking and emotionally attuned adult this was not so great.

B00C7KYXHW|4.0|This show is a wonder, so original and the actors and their characters are fantastic. The day this got picked up for a 2nd season was a very happy day indeed. If you can handle beautifully done gore, give it a try.

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This Hannibal is much different from that all-time favorite, Anthony Hopkins. I must admit that it took some time to get used to the new interpretation of all the familiar characters involved. Will Graham is the true focus; Hannibal is quietly lurking in the background playing puppet-master. This series is a prequel to Red Dragon and, as such, Will Graham is the star. I prefer the current Will to both previous interpretations on screen. In a TV series, there is ample time to explain his peculiar gifts. Although I watch it on NBC, I have also purchased every episode from Amazon Instant Video. In video those irritating interruptions known as commercials disappear. Even fast-forward is a drag. I strongly recommend the video version as the subtleties are not lost.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|This film was so good - how reaching out to others in need is so important when you can.  Often each busy day we overlook others who can be brought into our lives enriching us too.  What a good film to show over again.  One of Sandra Bullock's best films - her acting skills are coming to fruition.
B000FBJF6Y|3.0|It is rather refreshing to read a crime novel that isn't about the gore.  The cast of characters is small, the protagonist is a very honest person with great insight, and the moral dilemmas she faces are relevant.  However, the stories are superficial at best with little development.  The book is an easy  and quick read, and the stories delightful in their own way.  I enjoyed the information the stories tell about the African people and characteristics..
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is definitely the best quell game so far. As an owner of all three I must say this one has better graphics and gameplay than both the previous releases. Keep making great games Fallen Tree!
0823003035|1.0|This book should have been titled, \\"How To Tediously Mimic a Photograph,\\" because it has nothing to do with figure drawing. Nude models just happen to be the subjects that are painstakingly copied to resemble black & white photographs by an incredibly tedious, mechanical process that most people wouldn't have the patience to complete. The author apparently wanted the book to look like it's about figure drawing to increase its sales but, BEWARE, you will be very disappointed if you're expecting instruction in figure drawing.  The discussion about the use of angles and triangulation for recording proportions is the only part of the book I found useful for checking proportions, but not as the mechanical, drawing substitute used by the author.

0439023521|5.0|This book is so exciting and full of action,it has a lot of detail. The plot is planned perfectly with the connection between Katniss and Peeta with the talkshow in the capitol how she gets mad about the \\"star-crossed lovers\\" rumour,and then in the games how it turns into something very different. This book is amazing.

B00006JLX4|5.0|Because it established Malkmous' voice as a standard to be measured with both lyrically and in his phrasing--which is endemic as Dylan's. As with many first albums you sense the time and care put into the guitar licks, most of which they never equaled. Another aspect is how the drums on this album, from the nutty Gary Young, propel the guitars forward--even if they are buried in the mix like the vocals, a la early REM. The lack of such a drummer is noticeable on subsequent albums, even as the guitar fuzz lessened and some of the melodies increased. One of the all-time great summer albums. (This extended edition is worth the extra cost since it includes the stellar John Peel song, \\"Kentucky Cocktail,\\" which is not to be missed along with an electrified version of \\"Here,\\" and also includes the great EP of this time (still w/ Young) that had \\"Texas Never Whispers,\\" \\"Shoot The Singer,\\" and includes the excellent extra compilation track \\"Greenlander.\\")
B00B37RYMQ|5.0|I am overcome by how lovely Austen wrote this story of young and sometimes ignorant love. The characters are rather relatable and it is easy for one to become invested in their lives, involving both their triumphs and tragedies.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Chris Hemsworth Hemsworth makes a great Thor.  I enjoyed getting to know the character and the plot lent itself to the Avenger franchise.  After watching the new DC Superman, I must say that I prefer Marvel' s concept better.  Buy it and enjoy.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|\\"If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.\\"<br /><br />I loved the first two Crossfire books and with the way the second one ended I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen with Gideon and Eva in book three, Entwined With You. Talk about a mega cliffhanger and then waiting for what seemed like forever for Entwined's release I was ready for my Gideon fix! I have to admit I got a little nervous with the mixed reviews I was reading but I think knowing ahead of time that this wasn't going to be the last book prepared me for the ending, plus nothing stands in the way of me and Gideon Cross! Sylvia Day knows how to write hotness and book three was no exception. She stayed true to the characters - as always Gideon is the ultimate fantasy. Simply put he drips sex appeal.  I'm not sure what else to say because he basically renders me speechless.  Now, moving on before I get all hot and bothered!<br /><br />At the end of book two Gideon pretty much makes the ultimate sacrifice for Eva and her safety and Entwined With You picks up right after that. This book delves primarily into the after math of their relationship after this event takes place.  Can they move on from this, can they be together again? Those questions are answered but more arise as new characters emerge that begin to threaten their relationship as well.<br /><br />If you've read the other two books this is an absolute must read! I would also recommend watching the interview that Aestas at Aestas Book Blog did with Sylvia. She talks about the series and where it's heading after book three. At this point, Eva has gained more confidence in their relationship. Gideon knows everything about her past and they are working through it. Now it's Gideon's turn.  He still has his demons to deal with and it sounds like that's where the next book in the series will be heading.  More Gideon Cross?  Yes, please!

0345803485|5.0|People who have been in \\"vanilla\\" relationships may blush when they read it from the descriptive sex scenes. But if you have been around the block a bit it isn't anything too shocking. I found them to have a good story, behind all the sex. I can't remember which, but one of the books was a tad slow. All in all though I enjoyed the series and read them in 4-5 days. I enjoyed the writer and look forward to any future books.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|The story was good, though the characters are in a depressed situation.  I found the plot to proceed a little too slowly.

B00003CWNR|5.0|It is one of t he best movie I have watched,it is a great chick flick! I recommend it as a very moving movie that covers a lot of emotion.
B00CZ6WKVO|4.0|Honestly, I'd like to give this album 5 stars...I definitely would have given it 4 and a half (if that were an option).  First, let me tell you right off, I am a Poco fan (or 'Poconut' as some might say).  I say that for no other reason than to say I think being a fan of an artist tends to automatically add one more star to a review than a more casual fan might give (in general I think fans rate their bands higher than non-fans).  So first, let me give you the only reason why I did not rate this as a 5-star recording: Mike Webb's 2-songs.  Plain and simple.  As great an addition as he is for what he adds as an instrumentalist, his song-writing and vocals are lacking (at best).  \\"Love Has No Reason\\" makes \\"That's What Rock and Roll Will Do\\" actually sound okay (and it's really not).  Both are very simple songs,basic both in structure and dynamics.  While \\"TWRRWD\\" has the nice addition of Rolling Stone alumni Bobby Keys on saxophone, that's about the only redeeming quality.  The vocals on 'LHNR' are very weak and sadly bring to mind how Webb stumbled, bumbled, mumbled and forgot the words at the show I saw them at in Fairfield CT (he started the song over and completed the second time around).  I am not here to bash him...I actually felt sorry for him at the show.  But let's focus on the positives...and there are MANY!  Rusty's song-writing (and voice) seem to be as strong as ever.  As highlighted in some other reviews, \\"REGRET\\" is among THE BEST he's ever written/recorded.  His \\"Rockin' Horse\\" is one of the heaviest songs he's done since the barn-burner \\"Legend\\".  \\"Pucky-Huddle Stomp\\" (bluegrass/hoedown) could have been on any of the first 7 or so Poco albums.  I look at \\"All Fired Up\\" and \\"Neil Young\\" almost as novelty songs...great ones at that, but to me, still a bit over the top.  That said, they are still very well-written and enjoyable songs (to me, they just don't have the depth of the other songs previously mentioned).  The real highlight of the album for meis the full emergence of  Jack Sundred as a songwriter, vocalist and performer---enough so to quiet many of those (like myself) who early on doubted the merits of Poco continuing on without Paul Cotton.  Jack's strong presence on this album, at least for now, will quell such naysayers.  Jack demonstrated his chops a bit on the last Poco album (\\"Running Horse\\") and proves here that was no fluke.  \\"Hard Country\\" (a remake from an earlier solo album) may well be the best song on the album.  Clocking in over 7 minutes, it shows the band at it's best instrumentally, featuring guitar, mandolin and organ virtuosity & jams Poco is not really known for.  His voice too is very strong...quite reminiscent of Don Henley in his prime (unfortunately for Rusty, Poco cannot seem to get away from Eagles comparisons...even though it was the Eagles who took Poco's sound and made millions from it).  \\"Drink It In\\" and \\"Long Shot\\" are also excellent, well-written and performed songs.<br /><br />In summary, what you have here is NOT what some might say and think is Rusty Young trying to hold together and live off the last vestiges of a band whose key members have all left...no...what you have is the latest incarnation of one of the great early pioneers of Country Rock, still writing and performing relevant songs that are still very much in the tradition of the original lineup.  BTW, Rusty is going to be elected into the Pedal Steel Guitar players Hall of Fame.  If you catch Poco in concert, you may see him perform the Buffalo Springfield classic \\"Kind Woman\\" (which he played on the original) with just he and his pedal steel.  After seeing that, you'll see exactly why he's in the Hall Of Fame and like me and many others, you'll be grateful he's keeping the Poco legend alive!
B009EQG80W|5.0|I highly recommend this book to many of my friends. It is the foundations of Christian Spirituality together with psychoanalysis.
0143122916|4.0|Very, very interesting read. I went to public school in new jersey. I learned about our civil war a million times, but rarely touched on the history of the world around us. I recommend this to anyone who wants to expand their world view.<br /><br />Shin was given a life sentence the moment he was born. He was sentenced to live his life as a prisoner for crimes he did not commit. He spent his life in constant hunger and pain. When his mother and brother tried to escape, he turned them in (hoping for food) and ended up being tortured for months before he watched them executed in front of the camp.<br /><br />Harden intertwines Shin's story with stories of other men who have fled North Korea, what an \\"average\\" North Korean's life might be like, and the lives of the leaders and their friends. Harden writes about North Korea as a country: The rise and death of Kim Kong Il, how they committed insurance fraud to collect money from other countries, and how they survived on aid from their neighbors.<br /><br />Escape from Camp 14 is a challenging read, but it should be read.

B005KAH7QU|3.0|I liked the concept. Ending could've been better but I enjoyed the movie. The young actor has a bright future.
B001JNND9W|5.0|This is a cult classic that mixes a long car chase with a heavy dose of counter-culture, circa ''70/'71.<br /><br />I more or less grew up with this movie and always loved it.<br /><br />It's not for everyone nor was it intended to be.
0765334798|5.0|It is delightfully witty and fun, intertwining many aspects that would be familiar to any science fiction fan. Short, but you can't put it down.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This VERY cleverly written show is a must-watch!!!  For anyone who seeks a beautiful and 'clean' looking cast, setting, and a  smart script, you will be pleasantly surprised and 'refreshed' with this show. The characters are unique, intelligent and extremely witty. The show's writers have nailed it in regards to developing like-able and sometimes very 'unlikeable' characters who are as smart as they are funny. Gabriel Macht, who plays Harvey Specter, is PERFECT, and he most certainly wears his 'suit' well-as does all of the exquisitely dressed cast.

B002M9WW30|5.0|Rocky: The Undisputed Collection was the perfect present for the Father's Day.<br />Excelente images and sound.<br />Very godd the extras disc<br />Thanks
B003MAOTP2|5.0|this is a great movie, it's only fault was it was released after 911, if 911 had not happened this would have been a block buster of a movie.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Too dark and sinister for animation.  No matter what the rating, I'm sure a lot of children wanted to see and did see this movie. Overall, I was disappointed:(.  Thanks Amazon Prime. I'm glad this is one I didn't purchase.
B005HED08I|5.0|Star Trek is a classic show that is entertaining for the whole family. I grew up watching it with my family and I still like it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Very solid game. Keeps you interested by unlocking suits, and different boss battles /locations. Minor gripes- Bad voice acting, and suits are uber hard to unlock.<br />Other than that, fantastic.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I highly recommend this app. this is like the instagram for kindle( except for the fact that it doesn't have a camera).this is a great app. All the way
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My grandsons - 7 year olds - and I did this together and really enjoyed it. They are actually much better than me of course!
B009NY43NY|3.0|This book just left me going...&#34;that's it? That's all there is? What happens to Tara and JB's babies, what about Sam, Jason, Bill, Eric, Pam, Bubba?&#34; I was very disappointed. I watch the True Blood series on HBO and it doesn't follow the books so I guess I'll never know the answers to my questions, unless.....................
B0058VW36U|4.0|I'm having trouble figuring out some of the levels and getting pictures.  I still think this game is very  fun.
0307165485|5.0|A book that your baby will grow with. It has wonderful vocabulary, great bedtime stories and colorful pictures in it.  My copy is old, worn and dog eared but I gave a new copy to my niece for her little one.  It's actually a wonderful investment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this!!  My friend and I can exchange gifts so we each get $1000.  I ride horses and this is really fun!
B0058W74UY|2.0|Would love to tell you about this but since I can't figure out how to install it on my Kindle - I have nothing to share!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have a really difficult time waking up except to this alarm. I love that I can shake it to snooze instead of trying to see the snooze button. Excellent alarm. Best I've ever had!
B007HO392S|5.0|I love Carrie's music and was not disappointed with this album. She is an incredible singer and I enjoy this album as much as any of her others if not more!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I was hooked from the very first episode. You become invested in ever character and you feel their love, pain, and triumph because they are constructed so very well. The last season broke my heart when i got to it.
B0059R5Q08|4.0|A very unique rendering of a great story!  I love this story, and I enjoy the different interpretations.  Good movie!
B008X8P8A8|5.0|For a free game, this one is pretty good.  Nice graphics, easy to understand interface.  I would recommend this game to others.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accurate is all I will say the graphics are excellent the forecasts are right on the dot the radar is up to the minute it's real time
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Ok its fun but its just like one of those games on friv. Would I keep it, NO! Not worth keeping but its fun.
B00136LZG8|5.0|I bought this album as LP in 1965 or 1966 and it became the best collection of pop music I have ever owned.  Now to have in \\"the Cloud\\" is priceless.  My kids and my grand kids love this music.  It is a truly classic album and will be around a long time to come !
B001DUDKEY|4.0|I am an avid fan of all things Jane Austen. This movie was one of my favorite adaptations of her work. I am glad Amazon offers it.
B0031ESIZQ|1.0|I got this loaded onto my PC, but it doesn't want to play.  All I get are graphics errors.  My PC has all the bells and whistles on it to play these types of games and this one doesn't want to work.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 did not disappoint, once again I was hooked and could not wait to watch each episode.  Looking forward to starting season 3!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|this is a super fin game but it cost a lot for any app its really fun though for any age
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Well written and a bit frightening to learn what is actually happening in North Korea. A closed society by definition is oppressive.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I really like all the songs on this album.  There are several different styles among them, so it is not monotonous to listen to regularly.
B00821OX98|5.0|I didn't watch this on TV for 3 seasons...thought, for some reason, I wouldn't like it. Once I started watching it was like a book I couldn't put down. The characters are good enough to be rooted for and flawed enough to be likable. Subplots keep it interesting and the dialogue is believable. As a sci-fi drama..I would recommend it.
B00BI745AA|4.0|classic done well. A reminder of the ignorance and insensitivity of humans. Although I expected less I thought Russel Crowe did an ok performance in his part.
0857868764|3.0|The Humans by Matt Haig starts off sort of emulating the first season of Third Rock from the Sun.  An alien arrives on earth, it has taken on the form of Andrew Martin, a human its kind abducted and killed who was a professor in mathematics who had figured out the Riemann Hypothesis, something to do with prime numbers being the secret to taking human technology to the next level which is far beyond our meagre accomplishments today which would include the ability to heal and immortality down the track.  Of course we being humans who don't have the best track record of being hospitable to other creatures would eventually stumble upon other life forms including the Vonnadorians and even though we may think we'd only have peaceful intentions, it's pretty obvious what would happen.  So to prevent this, the real Andrew Martin was killed, and now our new narrator (the Vonnadorian or more accurately part of the Vonnadorian as they have evolved to become one and the same) mission is to find out exactly who else Professor Martin told about his discovery and kill them as well.<br /><br />However the new Andrew Martin knows nothing of how earth works, for starters he arrives nude, and can't understand why he isn't fitting in as he walks around naked which of course brings him trouble from those arriving in vehicles with blue lights. The opening quarter of the book had a fun Third Rock from the Sun feel to it, I really enjoyed that part.  But then the alien seems to understand too much too fast and becomes pretty much just a slightly naïve at times person.  The last third he just becomes preachy, we even have a lengthy 97 points of advice to humans he leaves on the screen of one he has become fond of which you'll end up skipping after you get bored of it once you've read a few of them.  I guess it's supposed to be a let us human readers reflect on ourselves in a philosophical type way read, for the last third but that was just boring and rather annoying.<br /><br />The Humans was a book that started off so well but when it wanted change to become something else became more an effort to finish rather than the joy to read it started off as.as a book that started off so well but when it wanted change to become something else became more an effort to finish rather than the joy to read it started off as.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|This show was one of my favorite TV programs.<br />Music, dancing, drama, and comedy in a one hour package. I am sorry to see it get axed by NBC.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|I downloaded this directly onto my kindle fire hd after searching for it in the app store, however, I did not get a notification saying it had successfully downloaded. Furthermore, it does not appear in the my apps section yet on attempting to download it again, a message appears telling me it is already on my device.<br />Can anybody tell me how to get this to work or tell me how to completely remove it (if it is really on there)?
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|A little frightening for very young children but overall a great ride. Get popcorn turn up the surround sound and enjoy the ride. The CGI is excellent and the acting very believable. This movie is destined to become a classic.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This movie is a different slant on the classic Wizzard of Oz. it show how the Wizard came to Oz and why he stayed. It is fun and interesting view of the \\"witches\\" and the people of Oz before Dorothy's arrival!  I loved it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I heard about the subject matter, I really didn't want to see the Hunger Games movie, but I heard a good review on the radio, and I decided that I could handle it. Fortunately, it was a positive experience. I left the movie theater entertained and intrigued (and dizzy from all the shaky camera movement!). I also had a lot of questions about why this and why that. The book answered those questions, and it provided a much higher level of entertainment for me than the movie (even though the actors' performances were quite good).<br /><br />I saw the movie on a Thursday night and finished reading the trilogy by the end of the weekend, despite having to work on Friday. The books really pull you in, and you want to know more. If you are an adult reader like me, you have to buy into hearing the story from the point of view of a teenager with a teenager's mind and experience. The dystopian world that Katniss lives in is dark and crazy, but it also contains some shades of our own modern culture and government systems. All that, and there is a lot of suspense throughout the series that keeps you turning pages. Of course, there's also the whole Katniss - Gale - Peeta thing that keeps you going until nearly the end, and (spoiler?, not really) the ending is about as satisfying and positive as one can expect in such a screwed up world.<br /><br />Just read the book (and the next book, and the last book) - you won't be disappointed.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Have read every book in this series, and was excited to see how it wrapped up. Unfortunately I think Charlaine Harris just wanted it to end. This ending was rushed, and didn't make sense in the world that had been built up in the previous books, very disappointed in this series now
B002XXPNXG|5.0|If you are heading to see &#34;Before Midnight&#34; make sure to watch &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; and &#34;Before Sunset&#34; beforehand.  It is not everyday you can see a trilogy filmed over 18 years!  It is awesome to see the characters evolve yet basically stay the same at the core over time - just like in real life.
B006T3RM08|3.0|I also had the problem with the trackpad being locked in the depressed position when installed in the Clique. On the bottom edge of the trackpad tray there are two plastic protrusions, one in each corner. I got my dremel out and ground them down, convinced that would solve the problem but it didn't. Then I noticed that my trackpad was not perfectly flat and level. The aluminum frame of the trackpad is soft and they are easily misshapen. Once I tweeked my trackpad back into shape the Clique worked fine. I recommend that you check your trackpad closely that it is not twisted or bowed even slightly before returning your Clique. BTW now that I have it working I love it!
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|There are some slow parts, but most movies have them.  And I would have done the ending differently-what was the screenwriter and director thinking???  It needed one more short scene of them all together.<br /><br />But still was a very enjoyable movie.  Get it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I cant wait for more levels! so much fun. i couldn't put it down. I just loved it. I wish they had more levels now! makes time pass faster.
B007Y36K46|3.0|I tried to approach John Carter as someone who had not read the books. But I HAD read the books so it was somewhat disorienting to see all the familiar characters and settings but an almost entirely different story. Unlike some, I didn't have a problem with this John Carter's attitude problems, but Dejah Thoris failed to charm me. Of course the &#34;Incomparable&#34; princess was never more than a raison d'etre in the books anyway so I didn't expect much. I have to say, the VFX were stunning and very true to the books (except Woola was too cute) I just didn't get some aspects of the story and few explanations were given. For instance, why was the city of Zodanga a big moving pile of metal? And, why bring Therns into the plot when they clearly weren't necessary? I have other questions that will never be answered but those are important, sort of. As an action/adventure film it was compelling if a little disjoint and It's too bad there won't be a sequel. I'd like to see more character development and perhaps the other two Barsoomian races (Yellow & Black), but I'll manage. I really think it's a film worth watching. Mostly because it's visually stunning.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Superb cast and presentation gives us a look back in time to a graceful age but one that bridged into the modern era. The story lines are compelling and the acting believable. Where did they get all those 1920s cars?
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|True to the title, this book is wild. Raw, moving and real.

B00CWV8TIU|1.0|We couldn't get past the first 15 minutes of the movie without feeling exhaustively depressed.  It just seemed like a major downer. Maybe it gets better after a while but we just didn't feel like taking the chance and feeling even worse.
B000HF2NTE|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie multiple times since it first came out and still love watching it today. Stallone plays one of his better parts as an anti-political correctness, status quo member of society, nitro-injected and laser focused as a police lieutenant in Los Angeles. The movie kicks off immediately establishing his Cobra character, called upon when the other police resources will not work, for situations nobody else wants to address. Justice administered correctly and quickly in fully justified situations. Additionally, the Cobra character has a highly intelligent side many in the movie over look or simply do not recognize. This is an absolutely action packed, exciting, well acted and fun movie to watch, if one enjoys the serious kick ass action films of this genre. I highly recommend watching this young Sylvester Stallone express many personas, many unexpected, in this character. Oh! By the way (and this is not a spoiler), everybody who deserves it, gets it in the end. Watch it and enjoy it. To me is is one of the classics right up there with Dirty Harry.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I like the app a lot.<br />The app is good.<br />All the animals are cute.<br />I would like people to try it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|If you have a knife, especially one with a serrated blade edge, this Smith's PP1 Pocket Sharpener is a &#34;MUST HAVE,&#34; for safety of a very sharp blade and the convenience of &#34;carry it any where.&#34; A very small investment for a very high, long term, quality return. I purchased this for my knife collection, which includes several specialty and tactical knives with partial serrated edge blades. This product is perfect for sharpening the straight blade to a fine edge, recreate a completely new edge and finely sharpening the serrated edge of all different types of blades. The sharpener is very comfortable to handles, stable during its application of sharpening, regardless if you are left or right handed. I keep mine in the travel case containing most of my knives so I always have a top quality sharpener with me when I travel. I highly recommend this product with the best availability through Amazon.com and this seller all at the best price available on the market. The only excellent and safe knife is a well sharpened knife.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This book, and its following sequels was a very entertaining read. I was engaged through the whole story, even with a few grammatical and typographical errors. I would recommend this series to any fantasy fans and I am eagerly awaiting book #6.
B004KKYX9K|5.0|Loved this book, best read!! Jodi never disappoints but this was really unputdownable!!! Can't wait for my next read.. Have to decide which is next!
0761171703|2.0|I'll be the outlier on these reviews but I was sorely disappointed by this book. I am a professional dancer so of course I am happy to see any material celebrating dance. But this book is uninspiring. 90% of the pictures are of dancers in a very similar position; if you just flip through the book in one setting, you'll notice the same image again and again - a leap or a dancer leaning back with her/his leg in the air. Human movement is so diverse and this was all the author could come up with? There are hundreds of dance traditions practiced in the U.S. and they were nowhere to be found in this book. Also, Dance expresses the whole range of human emotions and again, it was the same facial expression (or lack of) over and over in this book. My favorite picture was actually of a woman not doing a backbend but positioned with her partner and with the most beautiful expression on her face. This touched my soul. We artists do see joy in the everyday because we recognize the crazy diversity of the human experience. This book fell very short of its potential.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Sure, there were a few plot holes, but I found it charming and funny. I would definitely watch it again.
B001M2604U|5.0|Gene Hackman was brought to the attention of moviegoers in [[ASIN:B00124O0GI BONNIE AND CLYDE]] (1967), but it was this Oscar performance in William Friedkin's THE FRENCH CONNECTION that made him a star. (Also won statuettes for Best Director, Picture, Screenplay and Editing.)<br /><br />Based on a real NYPD narco case and detective Eddie Egan, as portrayed by Hackman, Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle is a loose cannon in a porkpie hat. His nearly rabid pursuit of drug-smuggling \\"Frog #1\\" (Rey) comes to naught at this one's close, setting up a not-as-good sequel. (TRIVIA: In Egan's cameo as Walt Simonson, he gives Popeye a \\"dig\\" by repeating Doyle's favorite interrogation gimmick, the feet picking question.)<br /><br />Use of soundtrack music here is unique. In the film's most action-packed scenes, there's NONE. Somehow this lack of blaring music works great.<br /><br />Of historical note: the Bensonhurst Elevated Railway train that Doyle pursues in a commandeered auto is a last survivor of an extensive system built in the 1870s by Robber Baron Jay Gould. (MORE TRIVIA: During this electrifying chase sequence, a real collision occurs with another car, driven by a man going to work.)<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.9) The French Connection (1971) - Gene Hackman/Fernando Rey/Roy Scheider/Tony Lo Bianco/Marcel Bozzuffi/The Three Degrees
B00CXN2JNS|3.0|Maybe better than Thirteen, but definitely no where near Endgame. But definitely still Megadeth, and any Megadeth is good Megadeth.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love the game on the kindle is easier to play it on here than on my computer. I wished the game would respond better when I go to make a move. And what's with the creepy music it plays?
B0027UY8B8|4.0|Love this series up till season 4, where things all fall apart and get way to religious for my taste, but none the less, this is a wonderful box set to own.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|KUDOS TO THE CAST & CREW on this movie! What a great depiction of mental illness & the toll ittakes no only on the person affected but their family & friends too.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I enjoyed this book at the start, but gradually felt less and less sure of the way the story was going. Eventually, I found myself skimming the last few chapters and just wanted it to finish.
B001BR3ORC|4.0|This is an oldie but goodie!  Personally, I think Michael J. Fox, is an amazing actor.  I cannot count how many times I have seen this movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I play those escape game nonlinear all the time and have always wanted something on my kindle fire that's similar. This is better than similar. I like the setup o levels and the problems are completely solvable. However, I would like to see some sort of storyline.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I did not have much luck with this app in my ipad or android based systems. Hope we get an improved version.
B009R659L8|4.0|This book was one of Mary Higgins Clark's best.  I usually figure out the \\"bad guy\\" about 3/4 of the way thru.  Not this time!  The only advice I have for somebody reading this is to make sure you understand all of the characters relationship to each other.  There are a lot of them and the plot moves pretty fast.  This is a good one!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The characters have some notable moments of growth in this season. When a series runs into its 7th season it's easy for things to stagnate and become become stale. But Big Bang continues to nudge its characters forwards, giving them moments of development that are well earned from previous events in the series and had the been rushed they would have lost their impact.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written book. Wonderful prose. So easy to relate to some of these characters. Did not want this book to end.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Not exactly what I was expecting, but this turned out to be a great feel good movie! Definitely recommend it.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not as good as the books, but I suppose for a rental, it was fair enough. But I'd wait until its less expensive before renting again.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I loved the history in this movie.  I found it very inspiring and think that all Americans should listen to the message!
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Great prequel to the Wizard of Oz.  Even though not a 3D DVD, it still gave appearance of being so.  Beautiful colors and lots of humor.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|I was tired of TNT and other networks cutting this movie to death. After watching the uncut version, I found that I have never seen the great beginning which helps to set up the rest of the plot. I had scene the dinner at Meg's house which is usually deleted or barely shown on the networks. To me, this movie can be watched periodically and still be be fun. Helen Hunt is always great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is sooo addictive! I need more rooms please, there are not enough! Some levels are frustrating, but solving the puzzles is a rewarding experience!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is such a wonderful app. It is full of interesting ideas. I have only had this for a couple of weeks and I really love it!
B007R21JJK|5.0|Normally scared of ordering because I've had a couple DoA, this one worked perfectly out of the box.<br />The reviews on Newegg were good as well.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This is more of a guideline as to how to play. I gave it four stars because the keyboard is small and hard to play for any adult.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Works incredibly and the windows rating came up surprisingly high.<br />Good for low budget, and it actually plays games quite well.
B001E45XT4|4.0|After a few months of using it, the mic would like to add static to my conversations. After taking it upon myself to fix it, I soon learned that the wires themselves we of minimal quality and became kinked inside the headset from bad design. I figured I could just solder some spare wire to replace the defect, no problem I thought, but it turned out the wire was shit, resisted flux and solder, and the insulation that the wires were wrapped in had an extremely low melting point and the whole thing just was shit. I ended up stripping even more wire out and just crimping on connectors as a last ditch effort. Nope, the insulation is not only low melting, but it's also extremely fragile and just cannot be fixed.<br /><br />So in summary, this thing cannot be fixed when gets broken from being used normally after a few months of use.<br /><br />I am an electrician and couldn't even fix a headset.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|this product is not good.  It is not stable. There is no way to cut the bottle with to hands.  Need extra help to stabilize the bottle and score at the same time and when you try to break the bottle where the score is, it breaks somewhere else. We tried at the glass shop with professionals and they were not impress.
B0055SWM08|5.0|1. Repetitive music usually turns me off.  This one doesn't.<br />2. Challenging puzzles can sometimes be frustrating for me.  But I found myself determinately solving puzzle after puzzle.<br />(Maybe it's  the calming music. Lol.<br />All in all...kudos for a developing a game with \\" simple\\" graphics but complexities on a number of levels.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr. Hosseini never fails to enlighten while still entertaining.<br />Have enjoyed all of his books without fail. Wonderful Author.<br />Recommend highly.

B0070DOHQS|5.0|I use this to access my win7 desktop via VNC from my Nexus 7. I do this all on my local network, have not tried it from 4g or outside networks.<br /><br />It works well and isn't too hard to figure out. You're not going to do any mouse heavy projects with it but viewing pictures/videos or checking email is easy.
B0090EJ99A|4.0|One of the funniest movies I have seen this year. Hopefully something slight comes out soon can compare to this.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|I love the ability to keep up with others and see pictures of their families and journeys, but too many people use it for a personal  diary or complaint station. I really don't care to know when they get up or go to bed or clean the bathroom.

B00499NHLC|4.0|I like the plots and the actors play their parts well. It is a wonderful, carefree time of entertainment which suits me so well before I turn in for the night.  Sometimes I pace myself and watch about 30 minutes each evening.  Sherlock, however, seems just a bit too juvenile for the intelligent, super perceptive detective we all came to love in the Sherlock stories of my childhood.  I think he should &#34;grow up&#34; and become a little more mature.  On the other hand, Dr. Watson is perfect. He has successfully brought the old- fashioned and somewhat frumpy Dr. Watson of old into a dashing, attractive man of sensibilities and passion.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this game. You receive coins as you play and while you are not playing! And there is a puzzle to work on as you play. Definitely a fun game!
B00499QUK2|5.0|I didn't know what to expect before watching. The show quickly throws you into a convincing story with excellent writing and brisk pacing.

067144901X|5.0|I bought this book for my 9-month-old grandson.  A very fun book to read to young grandchildren.  A great gift idea.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Just started playing but I love it. Want really into these  kind  of games but when they're free how can you go wrong.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|I like this product because it is easy to use and follow.  However, if you are a true beginner, like I am, it might not be the best way to learn a song.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app on several platforms (iPad, Samsung Galaxy SII, Chrome book, iMac, Win7(vm)), and it is awesome. What I really love about it, if I am every in a position where I want to scribble something on paper, all I have to do is use the Evernote app camera feature to take a picture of the notes, and after a minute or so, my handwritten doc becomes searchable.  That is excellent. So, its OCR is awesome because when I say scribble, I mean some of the words almost look like scribble,  but are recognized. &#34; I wouldn't push the envelope in seeing just how sloppy writing it can read for important notes&#34;.  Plus, there are many other features I won't mention here.  I can't believe I waited so long to start using Evernote.  Check out it's webclipper app too.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My seven inch Kindle Fire HD travels with me everywhere I go, and this app is well used.  From using reminder alarms, to sleep timer music, to the  digital clock display the app performs great.
1401322786|5.0|This is a very fast read much like his other books.  Keep an open mind while reading because the story has some weird elements. The emotions depicted are very real.
B004WR125O|4.0|Great item, like the easy setup. It have problem sometimes connecting to mobile app, but other then that I would recommend.
B008220C38|2.0|Sad story (for abandoned son and husband); in this version of Tolstoy's classic, dumb story of nitwit heroine.  Liked the actors.  Hard to be sympathetic to Anna because of her selfish choices, when she was clearly old enough to know better.  Her husband was presented as an outstanding person - to me, no comparison in character quality between him and her boy toy.  Apparently she married too young and had no time to kick up her heels and so was ripe for seduction when a player came along.  She found his interest so flattering that ultimately she left her husband and young son for him, knowing nothing about him except that she desired him and he her.<br /><br />The story wasn't told effectively, as the storytellers did nothing to protect Anna's estimation in the audience's eyes: the storytellers should have made her husband less extraordinary and given her lover far more appeal; as is, her choices make her seem stupid, which I don't think was their intent.  All the actors were good, but I think miscast.  Kiera was made to look older, but didn't quite pull it off.  Her husband, I forget his name (oh wait, Jude Law), was the most honorable film character I've ever seen, and just his behavior alone should have made a sane female character remain by his side.  Anna's lover is merely handsome, in my opinion she is just a conquest to him, as evidenced in his conversations with his female lady friend.<br /><br />Just disliked him; he was a hunter on the prowl, caring nothing (in my humble opinion) for her initially (perhaps loving her somewhat after their affair had begun), but I disliked him for pursuing a happily married woman.  Early in the story he gave money to cover the burial of a poor man killed under the train, and I suspect he did so as he knew Anna was watching and wanted her to notice him.  Story didn't show that, but later in film, a conversation he has with a female friend social strategist clearly showed he knew what he was doing, and that his actions were very deliberately focused.  He really did all the running initially.  Can't blame him for Anna's ruin entirely as she at some point said yes, but she was a moron and he a selfish, self indulgent boy-man, willing to destroy a marriage for his sexual gratification.<br /><br />The screenplay is poorly executed as Anna demonstrates early in the story that she understands society's rules (when attempting to mentor her friend with the straying husband), yet she throws herself under the train (figueratively (sp?)) by starting divorce proceedings against her husband, and though knowing she'll be socially ostracized, cries and takes morphine to comfort herself.  Her character in this version wasn't well thought out.  Whatever the novel wrote (I don't remember that story after all this time), the screenwriters should have made sure the audience understood why Anna made her choices and if not condone them, at least appreciate why she felt she had to make them.  With her mature, kindly, truly loving husband attempting to advise her, rather than scream at her in outrage, the storytellers did Anna no favors.  This is Anna's story so it would be helpful if audience can see the story from her perspective and sympathize.  This version makes it real hard to do that.<br /><br />And unfortunately she never questions the character of a person who pursues a happily married wife and mother.  One wonders how this Anna survived as long as she did, and we can only conclude that the wealth of her husband, as well as his kind and loving heart, protected her from herself.  In this story, Anna does her own self in, for no understandable reason.<br /><br />On a sidenote, nice vehicle for Jude Law, but I thought (at least in theory), Anna Karenina was supposed to be a vehicle for Keira Knightley too.
B0006HBERA|5.0|I bought it for my soon to be 4 year old son.  He likes the game because it has vehicles (buses).  Still need some assistance with moving the game pieces on the board but can roll, recognize the number of dots and number of passengers to get on or off the bus. He will grow into it it soon.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Norah does it again! It seems every new album discovers a new avenue of approach for this lovely, gifted singer! Although I am the first to admit that I am her fan for life, I find Little Broken Hearts to be haunting and refreshing. The Lexiconesque echo lends a wonderful style to this absorbing album. Well worth the listen!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|With a mentally-ill mother and a father who has mysteriously disappeared, seventeen year old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) becomes mommy to her two young siblings...until she learns that her family will lose their farm to the bondsman unless her dad appears for his upcoming trial. The added pressure causes Ree to risk life and limb as she tries to locate her missing dad. You see, even estranged local relatives don't like anyone sticking their nose in their primary means of support--the manufacture and sale of crystal meth! Though one may disapprove of the subject matter, you will root for Jennifer Lawrence in her stunningly brilliant, powerful portrail of courageous Ree Dolly, \\"...an Ozark Hills girl bread and buttered.\\"
B004LQI0HE|3.0|Carey Mulligan (Great Gatsby) turns in a well-acted, less-is-more portrail of Kathy, the kind-hearted care giver of mandatory donors, who encounters her childhood love Tommy (Andrew Garfield)--spitefully claimed  as lover by Keira Knightely's Ruth in boarding school ten years prior. Trying to right her lifelong regret of the wrong she did her friends Kathy and Tommy, Ruth provides a name and address where the two might obtain a deferral from further organ-harvesting for a few years. \\"Will they succeed?\\" is the predominant question in this futuristic drama.
B005URRCUY|5.0|What's not to love about listening to the wonderful Black Keys. I always feel like my cool quotient increases by 4x whenever I listen to The Black Keys. Soulful, sexy, great. A must own CD for fans of The Black Keys. Also a great way to get to know this great duo.
B0010OIN90|5.0|We got this for my son's preschool graduation and he loves it!! He put it together in no time, along with the little racer car that comes with it, and he wears it every day.  he's able to get it on and off on his own (he's 5.5) and he's quickly learning to tell time.  I was afraid it might be heavy, but it's not at all.  The plastic is a little lighter than normal lego bricks. We're very pleased with this product, as well as the price.  Definitely recommend it!
B006Y5EDRG|2.0|The music and singing are good.  The dramatic scenes are tedious and difficult to tolerate.  There are cartoonish depictions of sterotypical characters that we're supposed to already know; ANgry director unhappy with everyones performance, the mistreated nightingale, the chorus tramp, the well meaning friend of alternative lifestyle who is armed with the wisdom of Yoda....
0989524116|5.0|I was really excited to read \\"Outin\\"! This sequel to \\"Outview\\" challenged my imagination and constantly kept me guessing what would happen next. I enjoyed the transformation of the original characters and getting to know the new ones. *SPOILER ALERT - My only complaint is I didn't think a certain character (one of my favorites) needed to die. I would without a doubt, recommend this book and \\"Outview\\" to anyone who wants a great read. Can't wait for the third book!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I love this game it's amazing the graphics are really good not that graphics matter and its pallet is nice you can evolve you monsters and they are fair with the in game prices.
B000U6BT40|5.0|This was a great show. Witty and imaginative. Funny without slapstick or offensive actions or dialog.<br />The cast was warm and easy to accept into our homes.  It's run was far too short. For which I blame Scy Fy which is less science fiction every season!
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|I wish the star rating were different, because I did NOT LIKE this book, but I recognize that it was a great book. And it was a terrible book. The only remotely likable character in the book was the nurse who drained the pus from Henry's boils. Each of the others were awful, mean, frighteningly odd, or otherwise the sort of people you'd (or at least I'd) rather not have the occasion to meet.<br /><br />Henry likes no one, picks fights with nearly everyone, and drinks to oblivion whenever he has the means. His acquaintances sexually satisfy a dog, pee in a family's milk bottle, and beat each other bloody. His parents are neglectful at the best and abusive at the worst. It's a terrible existence, and it appears to be autobiographical.<br /><br />I appreciated this book because it exposed me to a way of life I know  nothing about, but the truth is, I was fairly content in my ignorance. I wish there were no experiences like those described, and lived, by Burkowski.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It was great to walk around Nd j do one thing before the inherits a great game to play over and over and don't skip th e puzzles they are e the best
B00CWY76CC|4.0|really enjoyed the game. kept you searching and more involved on each level then 100 floors. just wish there was more then 10 levels. it sounds like they are trying to add more so that would be great.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|My first impression was that this was filmed by high school students. Maybe it was. I could only watch about 30 minutes of it before I had to stop. Watching movies is something I do for entertainment. I was not entertained. I was irritated by scenes that didn't seem to fit together and my ambiguity about what the film was supposed to be about.<br /><br />I know some people really like this kind of movie. They see the creativity behind the chaos. I'm not that deep. All I saw was low-budget chaos. At least I hope it was low budget.
B0091REZMW|4.0|cool game. pretty complete for tablet game. good graphics and a very complete map. I like it a lot. they're making me do this so this is what I'm writing
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Clever as always, and authentic as only an insider can provide.  Taut and brutally candid about the multiple mirrors of  conspiracy, the stakes, and the ethical dilemmas of the intelligence world.  Read it.  And then struggle to find your breath.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|I was taking 3 summer classes and working full time when I realized I had a big paper due on this book. I had no time to read it so I listened to it literally \\"everywhere.\\" I later read the paper back version and realized it was the same exact thing! I highly recommend it. It's convenient and a great read
0871164566|5.0|I love everything about this book. The instructions are easy to follow and there are so many great ideas in this book.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|This is an eye-opening account of life in North Korea.  The daily struggles are hard to fathom.  If you think you have anything to complain about in your life, this will give you a whole new perspective.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me and my 2 1/2 year old daughter love this game. It's fun and competitive it keeps me on my toes. Overall great game would go to it at anytime of the day. And if u have Facebook or any other social media you can compete with your friends. Did I say I love this game.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this book to have my son's teachers write in every year until he graduates high school, then I will give it to him as a graduation gift. It came in a nice cardboard type box that makes it really easy to store in and also to hide from him. I just had his Kindergarten teacher write in it this year.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am really really enjoying these books.  The characters are wonderful and every page is exciting to read. Highly recommend.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|My husband nearly banned me from reading this in bed; concerned about all my laughing.<br /><br />It was funny. Not deep. Not literature. A little self-depricating. A little insecure and over anxious and at the same time surprised at herself and her accomplishments. Most of us are this same mix--at least I can relate.  Most times stream of consciousness, I like that in my own writing and in a summer read. A good fun read. Only take away: Don't take it life too seriously. Amen!

0765350386|5.0|Mistborn is epic fantasy at its best. It seems anywhere you look for a new fantasy to read, someone is raving about Mistborn. Now I know why. Sanderson takes you into a fallen world were evil has ruled for a thousand years and introduces you to a crime team working in its underbelly. I've always enjoyed thieving crew storylines with all their impossible situations and plot twists. I'm also an avid epic fantasy reader. Mistborn is an impressive combination of the two. The book is full of action and surprise. The magic system is intricate and clever, while still being understandable and consistent. The characters are deep and full of personality. The plotline, although full of twists, is still believable. If you've enjoyed books by Robin Hobb, or Patrick Rothfuss, you will love Mistborn.
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|Royals is by far the best track on the album and will be the most known, however the other tracks such as Bravado and Million Dollar Bills are noteworthy as well. The album winds down and ends with a not bad/not great track, Biting Down. Overall though, it is a remarkable first EP and sustains a successful and intriguing synth/electro vibe with haunting vocals, not unlike Lana Del Ray, yet feels much better produced than Del Ray's work.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|It gives in detail what the weather is and will be for the entire day.  It then gives you the rest of the week.  It is so easy it is available immediately and the background colors make it very easy to visualize.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book kept me interested but it seem to end all of a sudden. as The ending was confusing jumping from finding out she was pregnant to the child being two. For a story that dragged to three books the ending felt abrupt and rushed.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I purchased original Swivel sweeper from Menards and was quite satisfied with it, until it finally died.  I decided I liked it enough to get another from Amazon. The product was inferior in every way from the original.  The brushes are not as good, the hinged drop door was replaced with awful dust tray that comes completely off. To make a long story short I would not buy this again.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|We watched the movie &#34;Hitchcock&#34;, which was really good, and decided to watch Psycho one more time. It was fantastic. And one can imagine that in a time when &#34;horror&#34; movies consisted of fantastic monsters like Dracula, the Blob, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, etc., the specter of a real person being so horrifying was in reality very scary. Kind of like Stephen King's &#34;Misery&#34; - terrifying because it really could happen!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. A bit easy, but still fun and addicting all the same. I find myself craving more and hated to see it end.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This app looked cool, but its not. It is hard to brush a lot of the hair and is a little confusing. its also a terriboe knock off of toca boca 's hairsalon 2. I prefer that one. do not waste your time with this.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I loved Vampire Weekend from the start, but this album features a more mature sound. Like the Vampire Weekend you already know, but way better!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I think its a really fun game. its not terribly difficult. cant wait until they come out with more levels
B009O07NDY|4.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for a sister. I have to admit that I haven't listened to it myself, but as far as I know, my sister loves it. The design of the case is very sturdy, and I am overall satisfied.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|A story to be cherished forever.<br />One is never too old to learn and love.<br />Not really just for the young.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Good graphics. Easy control except for movement. It's a little awkward at first. It may take some time to master.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I loved how the movie portrayed the young skinny Steve Rogers full of ailments trying to enlist in World War II during the 1940's.  The story just keeps you interested and is full of many twists and turns.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|good mind thinker. addicting. fun. hate that I am made to review this to keep playing.  that alone is lame.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|You can't beat the visual of this film. It really was spectacular!  The story was pretty good too, it just needed a bit more umph... If amazon would just allow half star ratings so I could give it the 3.5 stars I actually rate it at.

B0095P29EG|4.0|For starters, Chris Hemsworth is worth watching just because he is so hot!  Besides that though, the movie's special affects and overall story kept you on the edge of your seat.  You'll want to watch this one more than once!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game it kept me going for a while the only thing I did not like is it only gives u 10 levels and says more to come. I want more love. this game can't wait for more levels
B0091WNK8M|2.0|Perhaps if I'd seen it in the 80's when it came out and I was younger , I would've been able to appreciate it more... Oh, well.
B00001NTXN|3.0|The family has mixed opinions of this game.  In general, it is more fun with 3 or 4 players.  Learning to play is simple, but developing a strategy is more difficult.  I like it because each game is a bit different depending on each players moves in the beginning.  Strategy development does not begin until several moves in.  The end can be a bit anticlimactic because you can often determine the winner several moves out.<br /><br />As far as construction goes, the board and pieces are very well made.  It is a nice set that you can leave out as part of your game room decor.
B007W7P5L8|4.0|What a great case/cover!  I like the material it is made of... some kind of material that feels inbetween plastic and something smooth and soft.  If you get anything like food or drink on it, it wipes away clean & easily with water alone.  The different levels that the cover allows you to stand the kindle is totally key.  Plus, it locks my kindle fire in very securely and the elastic band that closes the cover is very convenient and sturdy.  I've had the cover for over 6 months and there is absolutely no wear or tear anywhere on it. I also love the fact that it was one of the only covers that had interesting color choices.  I got the purple one and it is a really beautiful grape color purple. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I think it would be nice if they added a slip pocket inside the cover and it would be great if they could figure out how to make the cover stand vertically.  You can kind of do it by opening it at a V but it's unsteady and not really meant for using that way.  It is meant for using horizontally.  Even so, I would recommend this cover to anyone. A solid four stars in my book!
B001HN6EF4|4.0|I'm a long term traveler and Uno is one of my favorite card games to lug around the world. I just got these today and find them to be a great set of cards. I hope they're as durable as they look. One thing's for sure - they're a bit on the heavy side! Because I travel carry on only and want to pack as light as possible, I'm very careful with the weight of the items i pack. They're size is perfect, smaller than the original, about the length of my small palm. Will update later on during my travels. So far, satisfied with purchase.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Even adult readers will enjoy the delightful and fast paced story. It leaves you with questions to peruse the next in the series. The characters are complex yet predictable and entertaining.
B00AAZSH0U|4.0|My toddler loves the Boynton book about hippos and so likes this one as well just not as much as the hippo book which is very engaging with a cute rhyming song as well.
193700788X|4.0|After reading all the reviews before i read the book i was prepared for the worst, but to me the ending just made sense. It was out of charactor for Eric to be so in love with sookie anyway sure we all loved him but this ending was more realistic if you will than one where eric and sookie end up together. These books have never been the glamor Of the twilight books, and makes me think of how the world would 'really' be with ficticioius supernaturals. Does the best couple always end up in an awesome romantic ending in real life? No. So why would sookie. She has always been for the most part just like your average human, so i would expect after her fun adventure she would have just an average human ending. So in short i liked it, it had a nice happy ever after in my book, and it didnt make the main woman in the story give up her whole life for some 'man' with outdated ideas if what a womans 'place' is in the relationship.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love this app but I don't love that it can take days to get anything done without buying bits or gems.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|The game play is great, its all the ads that is so aggravating, but what can you expect for free I guess
1455513458|5.0|Absolutely incredible! The &#34;Guys&#34; have outdone themselves - I just wish I could make it last longer:) Or that the authors would write faster! I do not want to spoil it for the others but if you are a Pendergast fan you will devour it, if you have never read Preston's and Child's work you are in for a treat and a possible healthy addiction.<br />Read it!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I  Loved the book.  It is a page turner.  I enjoyed  the love story but don't understand the pleasure in s/m.  I guess it is different strokes for different  folks.
B000FCK65W|4.0|This is a charming story, well written, that was published in 1943, during the Second World War.  It provided people a chance to escape the ever present war reporting.  The 1945 film adaption is also worth watching, if it can be found.  Teenage women will especially find it charming.  A very good summer reading project for students from about 10 -17.
B000068OCS|5.0|This film from it's very first seconds grabs you, invoking thought through stunning imagery and very unique and emotionally charged music. Without a single English word, Koyaanisqatsi takes this familiar imagery of the world around us, and draws clear parallels between man and nature, and perhaps wants to show the perils of man seperating itself from the natural order of the world.<br /><br />By its end, I felt that man, being fallible by nature, is clearly designing their own imperfect world in a blind pursuit of efficiency in all things. But, half the fun of this film is everyone drawing their own conclusions!<br /><br />I hope you enjoy Koyannisqatsi as much as I.
0823003590|5.0|Purchased this book specifically because to help learn new methods of drawing portraits. It has great in depth explanations. Not recommended for beginning artists though.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It really makes you believe in happy endings. Anybody that needs a pick me up should read this!
B00COQKE2M|5.0|So I've been listening to Ronnie's work since \\"There's no sympathy for the dead\\", and this CD is markedly different from all of the other music he's created.  He spans emo, pop, screamo, rap, dubstep and a few other genres throughout the cd to create a listening experience that never quite gets boring. Here's the song by song breakdown: (songs with an asterisk are recommended if you don't think you want the whole cd)<br /><br />1. Champion* - Starts off in a way that's reminiscent of Guillotine from TNSFTD with a rap interlude.  If you're looking for a song as a buffer between \\"The Drug in me is you\\", this is a good way to start.<br /><br />2. Bad Girls Club - A much lighter, electronic-heavy song with all clean vocals.  Playful but not terribly interesting.<br /><br />3. Rolling Stone* - My personal favorite.  Spans a bunch of genres in one song: screamo, pop-y (and ridiculously catchy chorus), dubstep, and some rapping in a way that doesn't feel out of place.  Another good song to show the transition between old and new.<br /><br />4. Fashionably Late* - Very much reminds me of \\"Situations\\".  A great, funny song with only clean vocals, and one of my favorites.<br /><br />5. Alone - The most extreme as far as how different it is from his old styles.  If you don't like electronica/rap, you could probably skip this one without missing much.<br /><br />6. Born to Lead* - If you're looking for a song that shows off all of the member's musical skills, this is the song you want. Fantastic instrumentals and great pace make it one of the best on the cd.<br /><br />7. It's Over When It's Over - Another good song that mixes instrumentals and electronica. Includes some rapping but mostly clean vocals with a really catchy hook.<br /><br />8. Game Over* - Another playful, funny song, though this one pulls off that tone a bit better.  An enjoyable song with another catchy chorus worth a listen.<br /><br />9. Self-Destruct Personality - Shows off some more of the instrumentals with lots of screaming.  The speed rap in the middle is pretty enjoyable.<br /><br />10. F*** the Rest - Probably the most forgettable of the cd, still enjoyable, but isn't particularly great at anything.<br /><br />11. Keep Holding On - A slower song to show off Ronnie's voice but still has some solo's to create a generally enjoyable song, though nothing incredibly special.<br /><br />12. Drifter - This probably felt the most out of place on the cd, a country-esque song unlike anything from TDIMIY.  It doesn't quite fit with the rest of the cd, so I guess it's fitting it's at the end.<br /><br />13. Where Have You Been - A great song worth picking up. Seems like another good mix between TNSFTD and TDIMIY.<br /><br />14. Goddamn - Nothing particularly special about this song, but it still is one of my favorites. Catchy with enough instrumentals to remind you how talented some of the members are.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|As a southern gal I really enjoyed this book, bitter sweet story with a happy ending. A little gone with the wind
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Just does not have the great story of Lord of the Rings.  The story was slow to start then did better towards the 2nd half.
0307472841|3.0|Yes, I like many others am a fan of Mankell's Wallander series, which led me to buy The Man From Beijing without hesitation.  I can easily say I am not disappointed and I enjoyed the book.  But something was nagging me in the story line.<br /><br />There were many points I enjoyed.  The book was unmistakably written in Makell's voice.  All of the nuances, problems, voices, etc. that he contains in his other books were there.  I enjoyed that the initial crime became second fiddle to the main story. I also enjoyed that the book moved across characters where they became the focal point of the book for extended periods. At first I thought the book was going to be centered on Vivi, then Birgitta came in, then Hong came in, then Ya came in.  All great characters that I felt I fully understood from Mankell's presentation.  It was also nice to not have Birgitta brood and mope around like Kurt (though I had my whiskey bottle on the ready if needed).<br /><br />Here is where my problem was with a part of the story line.  The battle on direction, more importantly the proposed solution, among the high echelon in China was implausible to me.  The potential uprising among haves and have nots is a very real issue that will impact China harshly sooner or later.  The solution to ship the have nots abroad was not plausible.  Especially to an African country that has been colonized in the past by Europeans, recently gained a new freedom, and at the time theoretically would have been allowing a Chinese population equal to 25% of their current native population to relocate into their country.  It all seemed odd to be a solution and point of argument for direction.<br /><br />Best point in the book was the wording and presentation of a simple realization that we all know intuitively, \\"One in five people on earth are Chinese.  No serious global discussion can occur without them.\\"<br /><br />Enjoy the book.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Downloaded to watch during an international flight.  The picture and sound are great and I love my HD Kindle for watching the movies.

B008JFUORW|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Four years have passed since audiences everywhere received The Hangover. An over-the-top comedy that followed three men as they tried to figure out exactly what happened the night before. Two years later we were given the sequel. A movie so similar to the first that many people didn't really see the point of its existence. Well now we have the third, and final, installment in The Hangover trilogy. While the previous sequel suffered from being too similar, this big finale is so different in its delivery that it almost feels like a completely different film. From the beginning Todd Philips stated that the third movie would be different, but I don't think I ever would have expected this.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there's still a lot to love about The Hangover Part III. You still have Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis). Jade (Heather Graham) returns for a brief appearance, as does \\"black\\" Doug (Mike Epps), and we get to see an older Tyler aka \\"Carlos\\" (Grant Holmquist). The thing is, this third installment isn't inherently funny. There's the occasional funny moment scattered throughout the movie, but as a whole this finale aims to be more entertaining than it does to be funny. It took a much more serious approach and that's where it's going to lose a majority of its audience.<br /><br />The story takes place two years after the second film. After causing a huge wreck on the freeway, Alan's father (Jeffrey Tambor) is so furious with him that he has a heart attack and dies. Alan's mother -- along with the Wolfpack, his maid, and a young boy from across the street -- decides to hold an intervention to inform Alan that he should go rehab because he's been off his ADHD medication. On the way there they get pulled over by a man named Marshall (John Goodman) who takes Doug (again!) until they can get him the money that Chow (Ken Jeong) stole from him.<br /><br />There lies the biggest change to the original formula; there is no hangover. Now this wouldn't necessarily be a problem if the foundation for the series wasn't built on this pretty glaring omission. Instead of a movie built around yet another drug-induced hangover, we have one that's focused on Alan. The entire movie is more of a journey of him maturing in his own odd way. Between seeing \\"his son\\" Carlos and meeting Cassie (Melissa McCarthy), you see Alan realize that maybe his life isn't all that great and maybe he should start acting like an adult. In the end that's really what this movie's about and, now that I think about it, it seems fitting given the fact that Alan always seemed to be the one responsible for everything.<br /><br />If you've seen the previous installments then you can expect more of the same as far as acting goes. Bradley Cooper still plays his calm, cool, collective character; Stu is still the first to freak out; and Alan is still a man child for a majority of the film. Honestly, even though none of these performances were new, I still enjoyed it. What always attracted me to these films in the first place was the characters, not the story. The three leads have always had a weird dynamic that always felt right within the context of the story. With that said, this was probably my least favorite performance from Jeong in this series, but they made up for it by including Goodman. Because, let's be honest, you can never go wrong with Goodman. Melissa McCarthy was a nice touch as Cassie and the young Holmquist gave a nice little performance as Tyler.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7.25 - To be honest, I expected something more out of the big finale, but I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. As I said before, I enjoy this series because of its characters and it was nice to see the Wolfpack back together for one final film. Still, I wish they would have given Doug a bigger role this time around. If you've been a fan of this series then I would recommend you seeit. Just don't go in expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy because that's not what this is and I don't think that's what Todd Phillips was going for.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like the game and it keeps myself and my niece busy. I think it would be a good game for anyone who likes a puzzle.
0307341550|5.0|This is my favorite Gillian Flynn novel so far. Flynn excels at intertwining unlikable yet liked characters with evocative premises and enough suspense to make it impossible to put down her books. Perhaps I just identified with this character more, or something about the premise caught me - but I think this one is the best.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|I just wanted the exact same product as the free version minus the ads. I could download a video but just a few and the option disappears.  it kept crashing on the kindle fire.
0307341577|5.0|This is a thriller as a thriller should be. Even better - it's not even really a thriller, it's just a whodunnit gone thriller. Gillian Flynn excels at creating characters you understand and identify with even though you have nothing in common with them. They frequently aren't even likable. She does a great job of making the reader root for and then dislike various participants in the story. I prefer this to Gone Girl, which got more attention, but it didn't strike me quite as strongly as Sharp Objects. LOVE the premise, love the characters. Looking forward to more.
0553582445|5.0|I absolutely love Robin Hobb.  Almost all of his books have been an utter joy to read and I am so surprised so few have reviewed it.  I feel sorry for the readers of this genre that have missed this author.  Robin can actually write, which in fantasy...lets be honest... thats not always the case.  Sometimes poetic, often funny, never trite..Robin creates such likeable characters!  They just feel very genuine, and he writes with such artistry and care.  I couldn't put it down and really tried to slow my reading down because I didn't want it to be over!
B0088X7YMS|5.0|Loved the movie, meet my expectations. Had more thing from the book that made it much better. Would recommended it to anyone who read the book

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this app. I have a hard time putting it down at night. I have played similar games and this one trumps them all. Highly customizable gameplay, not too simple but not too difficult to progress. The different pathogens are fun to play around with and all of them are unique. The real world mechanics are awesome. Everything about this game is &quot;just right.&quot; I definitely recommend!
B0041KWQBG|4.0|Like almost every cinematic bio, Michael Mann's ALI is necessarily episodic and contains a number of factual errors. The most glaring: Howard Cosell didn't call the Rumble in the Jungle (it was David Frost). The \\"Ali comes out to meet Frazier, Frazier starts to retreat...\\" doggerel was actually recited prior to the first Sonny Liston fight. Belinda's argument with Muhammad over his GF happened in Manila, not Zaire.<br /><br />Although he little resembles the brawnier Ali, Will Smith has the champ's vocal inflections down and he does a credible job in ring sequences. Jon Voight really channels Howard Cosell. The voice is so right, close your eyes when this actor speaks and it's as if Howard lives again.<br /><br />This two-and-a half-plus hour film covers Ali's life and boxing career up to his 1974 underdog victory in Zaire over a much-younger George Foreman. The Liston fights are here, plus Ernie Terrell's \\"What's my name?\\"thrubbing by Ali, the bloodying of Jerry Quarry and extended recreations of the first match with Joe Frazier. There's fragments of their second bout, but that's about it for ring scenes. No Thrilla in Manila or Jimmy Ellis breaking Ali's jaw. Nothing on George Chuvalo<br /><br />The script doesn't shy away from Ali's marriage troubles, and makes clear that he knew both Herbert Muhammad and Don King were opportunistic money grubbers. Ali's dealings with Malcolm X are here, as is that activist's public murder. The champ's opposition to the Vietnam War, charges of draft dodging that resulted in a 3½ year suspension from boxing and loss of his title are also of primary importance.<br /><br />In the boxing bio genre there's only a handful of films that are this one's superior. Among them are [[ASIN:B00062IVKS RAGING BULL]] (1980), the Jake LaMotta story starring Robert DeNiro, [[ASIN:B00066FABM THE GREAT WHITE HOPE]] (1970), a play adaptation with James Earl Jones as Jack Johnson (first black heavyweight champ), and [[ASIN:B0006GAO8Q ROCKY MARCIANO]] (1999) with Jon Favreau, a TV movie about the only undefeated heavyweight champion.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.7) Ali (2001) - Will Smith/Jamie Foxx/Jon Voight/Mario Van Peebles/Ron Silver/Jeffrey Wright/Jada Pinkett Smith/Paul Rodriguez/Bruce McGill/Giancarlo Esposito/LeVar Burton/Michael Dorn(1999) with Jon Favreau, a TV movie about the only undefeated heavyweight champion.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.7) Ali (2001) - Will Smith/Jamie Foxx/Jon Voight/Mario Van Peebles/Ron Silver/Jeffrey Wright/Jada Pinkett Smith/Paul Rodriguez/Bruce McGill/Giancarlo Esposito/LeVar Burton/Michael Dorn

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the trilogy so much that I want more and I just wish there was more to read. This was the best book ever.
B0026SCMNM|3.0|I had read in another review that Toibin is the new Binchy.  Not so.  About all they have in common is that Ireland is mentioned.  This author doesn't develope his characters as does Binchy.  He presents little humor, and the ending of the book is very disappointing.  It left me nowhere.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My granddaughter and I play this together. We love this game. Wonderful together time. She is only 6 but she solves the game fast.
B003NX75B8|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. I couldn't put it down. This is such a great story of friendship and love. Omg! I wan  to read it all over again!
B003MC5N28|5.0|Spoiler Alert******<br /><br />**************************<br /><br />I loved the first book, The Giver, which won a book award until I reached the inconclusive ending.  Did the main character die??? was the thought running through my head.  Similarly, I was confused by the ending of the second book which seemed completely unrelated to the first book in the quartet.<br /><br />Thankfully, Lois Lowry ties everything together in the 3rd and 4th books.<br /><br />I think that she was very creative with the fantasy part of her story and also with the different lifestyles/cultures in the various societies.<br /><br />Fascinating read!
6304712936|5.0|Thanks! it is a great flic and I love the play and music.<br />Acting is superb as is also the staging
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|This was an OK book. It felt more like a blog post that went on and on with no transitions between the chapters leaving me confused about how the chapters fit in what he was trying to convey. I think the author &#34;chose himself&#34; to also be the proofreader which explains the sloppy text and in some cases hilarious errors -- like where he confuses between temporary and temporal. But given the bar for self-published content, this is not so bad.<br /><br />I think the book offers some interesting insights. I picked up this book out of curiosity because Dick C. wrote a blurb about it. Meh!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great way to pass the time.  Can challenge friends when try to solve simultaneously.  Exercises memory, critical thinking, logic, and problem solving skills.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I spent hours playing this. 9 hours later I finished but I did skip. Something either by accident or cause I was stumped. Play it its totally addictive
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Good ass read. I was kinda shamed about the 80's after growing up in the 70's.  Peace, love and Zepplin  was my mantra. I cannot wait to dig up all the music and movies from that decade. Great concept for a story. We have created so much art and media in such a short span of time. It is high time to look back and marvel at the road to today.

B0000VCZKW|1.0|This is an inappropriate film for children, and adults. The parents never wanted Matilda, she was a mistake. She is ignored and bullied by her parents and brother because she is intelligent and likes to read rather than watch TV. They don't let her go to school because they need someone to be home to receive the UPS deliveries. The first half hour is an unrelenting exaggerated display of parental in-Matilda's-face yelling and bullying and I kept waiting for the story to turn the corner but that's family life. Matilda finally goes to school. The principal is a large, muscular woman, who was an Olympic javelin, shot put medal winner a verbal and physical sadist who hates children and never let's them forget it. She stomps around and they shake in terror as she cherry picks children out of the group to torture -- swinging a girl with pig tails by her hair, sending another for time in the upstairs closet that has long nails coming out of the walls, or throwing a child like a javelin towards the metal fence or making a fat child eat an entire giant chocolate cake until he's about to puke...  She bullies them all day long. There is a lovely teacher who is all love and light. We find out later that the Principal is her aunt and murdered her father. It was called a suicide. The principal lives in the father's house where the teacher was raised but she moved out when she went to college. Matilda and the teacher become fast friends and Matilda has special powers and uses them on the Principal. The principal ends up freaked out and sobbing in a fetal position in the school hallway with all the children pelting her with lunch food and laughing and everyone lives happily ever after --  what is the message to kids, to anyone?
B000UG4LYU|4.0|This was originally done as a soundtrack for a BBC mini-series, but only the title track was actually used in the series.  Bowie took some of the instrumentals from the actual soundtrack and expanded upon them creating this.  There are some great moments on this, some that hail back to his Berlin trilogy, others that seem to draw inspiration from Miles Davis's \\"Bitches Brew.\\"  They don't seem to work together, but the individual tracks are excellent for the most part.<br /><br />If you like Bowie's \\"Comeback\\" work (\\"Black Tie, White Noise,\\" \\"Outside,\\" and \\"Earthling\\") then this album is definitely worth owning.  It even features the original version of \\"Strangers when we Meet\\" from \\"Outside.\\"
0007466064|5.0|Excellent....Now I have to wait over a year for Book 6. Way ahead of the TV series. I haven't seen Season 3 at all yet..lol
B000025H0Q|5.0|This is Nick Drake's most upbeat album, which isn't saying much, I realize.  He does combine elements of smooth jazz, horn lines and sax into his folk sentiments; it works well together.  While I wouldn't call it a happy album, it is nice, smooth and mellow.<br /><br />As always Drake's lyrics are built upon a series of images, mostly derived from nature.  Personally I find them the strongest element of his composition; but in this album the music is superb as well.
B0081336FO|5.0|Ben Cumberbatch is a hottie and a very believable Sherlock Holmes. The modern take makes it new and with a nice twist to the original stories. The originals are recognizable but different. Gret series. Can not wait for the next.
B000005J56|5.0|This is simply an amazing album filled with all manner of Cuban music done by some of the greatest Cuban musicians in their twilight years.  The Latin Invasion and Island Jazz of the 40s and 50s had largely been forgotten by the American public when this album came out, now it has been reintroduced and rediscovered.<br /><br />In addition to the all stars themselves Ry Cooder adds his own touch, especially in the slide guitar on the track \\"Buena Vista Social Club.\\"  This is the must own record in the World music category.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a funny book. Jeff  Kinney  never disappoints me. I always go to his books when I want a good laugh. This definitely stands up to it's 5star standards.
B008QYT7DI|3.0|Although this is considered a classic and does contain imaginative passages, and wise observations, I felt that it was a little overrated in today's terms.  A bit obtuse and hard to follow, it is an allegory, but I've read better.  His observations on adults vs children's minds does ring true .
0399157565|2.0|I swore off my last Cornwell novel in 2009 and was only lured back because the jacket flap of this one promised something about a missing paleontologist and a dinosaur bone bed in Canada. So, yeah, that sounded interesting. Unfortunately, this gimmick has close to zero to do with the plot, is explored only tangentially (not to say indifferently), and is the reddest of herrings. The writing here is Cornwell at her terrible worst, including an apparently new verbal tic in which she uses coordinating conjunctions ad undas to string together the most outrageous non sequiturs. (Made-up example that is nonetheless a precise representation of the ugliness of this prose: \\"She saw that the rain was beginning again, and she didn't want that new Calphalon pan she had bought.\\") One supposes this is meant to catch the reader's attention; in this reader, all it caught in was my throat.

B007R108WA|5.0|Walk on the wild side with this bizarre, tragic and interesting film set in funky, dirty old Paris. Tragedy, biology and homicidal compulsion collide with the art of perfumery in this film.
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Okay, first off I'll just say I liked this theme and album, but... I didn't love it. Don't get me wrong, its very good ,but it's NOT Superman. I know one should not try to compare this to the John William's score as it could NEVER hold a candle to that classic theme. Hans Zimmer has fallen into the latest movie score trend right now in films. Scores that are more or less just tones. Repetitive beats and notes that seem to instill mood and tone but lack any imagination. Does this score do its job? Hell yes, but will you be humming it after the movie is over? Doubtful. Doubtful you could even remember it. There is not a whole lot of music here either. Most of it repeats and seems to copy itself track after track.<br />Is this Zimmer's best? No way. Should you buy it? Yes, only if you are an avid movie soundtrack collector like I am, but... be warned, it is very different than the more classical scores of the past. Superman should have at least had one big, trumpeted, triumphant march, and not this Dark Knight-ish dubba, dubba, dubba, dubba, dubba theme over and over.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I recently bought minecraft and it is the most used app I have. I only rated it 4 stars because you can't blow up the TNT, unless you are in survival mode, along with the flint and steel. If those had been in creative mode then it would have gotten 5 stars. Too bad.

He's a child genius and will do whatever it takes to bring his beloved Sparky back.
B004RL9T50|5.0|I am VERY particular about what my children see - I have a 7 year old girl and 9 year old boy.  I don't like movies with violence or references to death and destruction.  To give more detail on this, I should say that I am very sorry I allowed my kiddos to see the Cars 2 movie, and the Ben 10 Alien shows, Monsters vs. Aliens tv program (namely the episode about zombie carrots or pumpkins - something orange and zombielike) and even Ninjago is not on my list of preferred shows.<br /><br />I had not allowed my kiddos to watch this movie because I was under the assumption that it ranked right up there with these other shows and movies that introduce unnecessary violence and references to boogie monsters and zombies.<br /><br />I finally gave-in to the requests from my kiddos and watched this movie along with them.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It actually had a good story, and the violence was minimal - no zombies or boogie monsters - woohoo!<br />Some of the references to the budding romance between Megamind and the reporter went wooshing over my children's heads - that's probably a good thing.  :)<br /><br />We will probably end up adding this to our collection of movies.
B00B9EQS98|3.0|A good cast of star voices make this a very enjoyable movie.  The monsters are funny and not scary. There isn't any swearing and I believe that most kids would get a kick out of this movie.

0967175429|5.0|I've watched ThetaHealing grow for 15 years being the first practitioner and teacher in California. I know Vianna personally and know that she is authentic, kind, a humanitarian, a human, and is open to change as she works on herself using the techniques that she teaches.  Her early books have evolved from her very first one, \\"Go Up and Seek God\\" which is outdated in what is taught now. Yes, there needed to be better editing and proofreading, but Vianna wanted to get the information out quickly. Sometimes details got shuffled for reaching the hearts and spirits of others. And now Hay House actually edits and prints most of her books, and the books have been translated into many languages. We are a world-wide modality with even a ThetaHealing medical association formed in Japan.<br /><br />When I read about those who feel the need to falsify what Vianna has gone through, to create distortions and reputation-smearing, and those who wish to believe that these fabrications are true without the facts but hearsay, then I support people to truly understand what it takes to listen deep inside to a divine calling that was based out of a terminal illness, cancer, to bring a huge shift to the world. People's egos who haven't done their own deep work often want to usurp what another's destiny is. Vianna followed her truth and inspiration. It took courage, dedication, focus and a deep commitment to her purpose. I sure wouldn't have wanted to be in her position doing all this with three children to raise.<br /><br />If you want to read about Vianna and Guy's journey as a couple in developing ThetaHealing, 'Wings of a Prayer' is inspirational, touching, funny and real. The Basic and Advanced books have amazing amounts of information and are written to supplement the workshops. I've read them several times and learn something new every time because I'm at a different place in my evolution.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|Even though it is my least favorite in the series it is still one I watch every two years or so.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Pretty good way to waste a few minutes. All around fun game. I enjoy it. Could be better. But could also be worse.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies.  I have owned it on VHS but the tape was going bad so I needed to replace it with a DVD.
1575666286|5.0|Just awesome and great info. Go Gerson! Everything you need to know about maximizing nutrients in your body. Just flush those toxans out!
B00AESN8XY|2.0|Hello Amazon should give me the money I spent back I bought all of the PLAGUES!I am a fan of the game. I realize now that Amazon ripped me off.I wake up this morning to play the new necroa virus disease type and its locked.Now amazon I request the amount of money I spent in coins back. This is unfair and if I don't get my money back I'll sue you or just buy a nook or an I pad. Your choice not mine THANX.
B007ZYJT1U|4.0|A good use of video time. Generally interesting on several planes. Videography was creative and sometimes in the wow category. The storyline is not uncommon, but it overrides that cliche by the use of excellent acting and editing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is a awesome game that blows my mind off. I love it. It just gives me a time to unlimited playing. It never gets boring.
B00BR0SGN0|2.0|First let me say that Purple has been one of my favorite bands since 1972.  I have every album/cd they have ever put out, as well as \\"bootleg\\" recordings they they used to sell in rare vinyl stores.  But since Blackmore left, there has been a steady decline in great songs, and after Jon Lord left, it really went downhill.  Every cd has the same problem, very few great songs.  ( Blackmore's cd's have the same problem).  Since the guitar and keyboards basically make  most of the music, they need to replace them and get some fresh writing.  On this cd, I only liked 2 out of 12 songs, which is not so good. Up to Blackmore's departure, I would love all or nearly all of each cd.  It's a shame, because they all are wonderful musicians, but  most of the songs  just don't do it for me.  I always vowed to buy any cd that Purple put out, but after so many so -so cd's, I think I've had it with this lineup.  The DVD was ridiculous in the fact that there is a long interview with the band, and then 3 audio tracks, which have one great song live.  When you spend 15 bucks for a CD/DVD,  there should be some great concert footage on it, not interviews and audio tracks.  What were they thinking?  As long as Blackmore and Lord are gone, they will only be as good as their old material.  But for the devoted fans of Purple like me, there is a few good songs to add to your ipod.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|unbelievable fantastic this is the best item for  generation three nano lets me us my free bird ear phones perfect
B00CA4S27W|2.0|First let me say that I've been a devoted fan of Blackmore, since 1972, in the early Deep Purple years.  I have every Deep Purple, Rainbow and Blackmore's Night album/cd made.  But this latest group of his has many songs on every cd that are just too mellow for me.  There is always some great songs on every cd, just not enough of them.  This cd is typical.  I liked 3 out of the 13 songs on it.  That's not so good.  In his Purple/ Rainbow days, I liked all or nearly all of them.  I must admit, I'm a solid rocker, and I don't like most mellow music, but alot of this renaissance music just gets too mellow and deep for me.  If you are a Blackmore fan from the Purple days, you will likely be disappointed with the majority of this group's songs.  But being a devoted Blackmore fan, I still buy his cds, and just try to enjoy the 2-5 songs on each that appeal to me.  I do like some of the mellow stuff, but it just gets too mellow and lame at times.  As for the bonus DVD, it should have had some good rocking songs from concerts, not just a long interview with him and his wife, and a few acoustic songs done during the interview, as if there aren't enough mellow & acoustic songs on the audio cd.  Blackmore has just gotten too mellow with age.
0385349947|5.0|Great book, she is very straight forward and tells it like it is.  My experiences are very similar and all the haters need to get a grip.  Stating what it is, isn't whining, it's just telling the story.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Glad I read reviews prior to this book as I would've been disappointed to find out that this was not the end. Instead, I'm happy to know that the saga continues!
0738212415|3.0|it does not have enough drawings on people .I would have like to see different sets of eyes and faces
145210655X|5.0|This is a very cute, whimsical book written about Darth Vader raising a 4 year old Luke. Each page is it's only separate comic. Some of them don't make a whole lot of sense (at least not to me)...but as a whole it's very funny. Anyone who has raised a 4 year old can definitely relate! My son got this for his daddy for Father's Day this year. It would have been a better gift to give when he was younger (as he is 10 now and many of the antidotes no longer &#34;apply&#34; to their relationship). I am still glad I purchased it though! A great addition to my husbands very LARGE Star Wars collection!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I do not think that I know anyone who loves Star Trek more than my husband;  he loved the original series, and then really enjoyed Jean Luc Picard & Data.  He really is enjoying this set
B00005ONMJ|5.0|Have heard numerous performances, and many of this conductor as well..<br />This version is highly recommended for the heightened tension which builds throughout musically - mirrors the depth of Mozart's own underlying idea.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I consider this to be one of the best books I have ever read.  Our book club read this book, and all 9 of us felt the same way.  We have started incorporating the language of flowers in each occasion where flowers are suggested.  It is like a private language shared between us, yet I recommend this book to everyone who is looking for a good book.  Thank you for writing this for us!
B009KY5OGC|5.0|Everyone should read this book!!!! What did we do to the true first Americans????!!!!! How sad! This should be a required read for school children!
B0001I562I|5.0|We were wanting to purchase this movie for the family and found it on Amazon!! The price was great too!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie is so absolutely worth watching. As with other Tarantino titles, it is quite raw and brutal in places, but that is also when it is most honest. Christoph Waltz  is mesmerizing. His portrayal of Dr. King Schultz seems effortless, warm, and genuine and was one of the best things about the film, Jamie Foxx was the perfect choice as Django and surprisingly nuanced. Equally pleasurable to watch was Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie. He portrays the perfect mercurial, psychotic plantation owner. However, my description of his portrayal doesn't even cover the many facets that you see on the surface, and especially the glimpses you get beneath the surface. Samuel L. Jackson was very good as Stephen, you want to hate his character, but you just can't.
B00881VLCE|5.0|It keeps me occupied and when I'm waiting for something, I can just whip out my phone and play on this.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I always loved Rod's music!  But as I have aged over the years - just turned big 60, I have really enjoyed his mellow rock albums of recent. I really like that his voice is still strong and he sounds the same has he did in his younger years! I still like old tunes like Maggie May, but this one rocks as well!
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome game worth the price but wish there was more stuff like tracks nether portals but still an awsome game
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I've never played a game that I wake up and have to play. I get home from work and have to play. Just need to get more coins to upgrade my abilities, get further, next level or new scheme. Love it!!! More, more, more...!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game that makes you think about how to better your city and continue to expand. I recommend it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is definitely challenging. I enjoy testing my brain and realizing that I'm getting better at putting 2-&-2 together XD Highly recommend this one ,^~^
B00BSBY38A|2.0|I could not finish this slow, absurd movie. Amazing cgi but that's as good as it got, the spiritual mumbo jumbo was too much for me
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really liked this book, in fact it will be my choice for my book club when my next turn comes around.
0307887960|5.0|Just get it.  I am not missing sugar nor bread.  Lost 30 pounds since I started the diet (end of April - about 2 months).
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an entertaining version of solitaire.  My grandkids like it too.  It's a good game to have for trips.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I love a good Romance comedy. I especially love a book that can me laugh out loud. This book did all of what I expect form a good romcom.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I wanted this device to copy an interview cassette tape for genealogical purposes. It worked fine the first time but there was too much static on the converted copy so I tried again with some adjustments.  Everything seemed to be going fine with less static and then the recorder just quit working .....period....quit working/running. So, I've wasted my money and will just go ahead and go to the expense of taking my old interview cassette to a company to have it copied.  This is so disappointing, not only the expense of the purchase and shipping but the wasted time of waiting for the item to arrive in the mail and also the time spent with the recording.  Don't waste your time or money on this item.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I'm an older man with shaky hands. I have trouble getting sharp photos. With this remote release and my tripod my shots are much sharper. Without the release cord even the photos I took with a tripod were not sharp. I shoot a lot of  night photos with long exposures,<br />which is one reason why I bought this. I think this is a good investment for any photographer.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Very good read but seemed to ramble at times. Giving details where it's not necessary. Not sure I'll read the next two in the series.
B002QE3CTY|2.0|I wouldn't even consider the Hunger Games to be an amazingly written book, but at the very least it was enjoyable, the story was pretty good, and the writing was good enough to not be distracting.<br /><br />Not so with the Maze Runner. The story could have been intriguing, but I found the writing to deter from the narrative. The slang/made-up language felt like a poor spinoff of A Clockwork Orange, and I never forgot I was reading a made-up story.<br /><br />Pros: it was a fast read, and you did want to finish. But, It wasn't compelling enough for me to purchase the second or third books.
B0058W74UY|1.0|got it for the games on fb doesnt work with it so I wasted time and space downloading it to my kindle
B008XG1X18|4.0|I give this app 4 stars just because there is so much spam or links that are bad . The 4 star I did give are fantastic. This app the amazing and the amount of things I can locate in just one location is amazing ! Love love love pinterest!!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I use it on my night stand for a alarm clock lights up great and sounds awesome on the kindle
B009RH9J7W|5.0|This case is sturdy and can be take it anywhere.  The flip action lets me put it in any position to fit on my lap.  Also the battery lasts a long time and you can still use it while it is chargeing.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|This is one of the very best movies of all time in my opinion. You can learn so much from it. Cute how he is involved in so many big events in history.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|not your usual movie.  unique in many ways.  I rarely say a movie is worth watching - my usual comment is it is alright.
B0016HMYEQ|3.0|Neat flick. Well done for what it is in my opinion. Not sure if I would give it any awards but it is entertaining and mildly original in my opinion.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This movie was terrible.  Don't waste your money or time.  I Can't believe Bruce Willis keeps making Die Hard movies.
1781162646|3.0|If I were a first time Stephen King reader, I may have given this book another star. The narrative was better than average, but overall, the book was lacking the 'King-element'. Even though I know Stephen King writes in multiple genres, when I pick up one of his books, I expect an element of creepy (Carrie, Pet Sematary) or dark without the creep (Misery, Dolores Claiborne), but either way, I expect great characters that are so richly drawn you don't forget them when you put the book down.<br /><br />This book started so slowly, I almost did put it down. The main character 'Dev' is rather bland in this coming of age story. The book didn't pull on any particular emotion which is essential for me in a solid read. I gave it three stars mainly for the narrative. The story itself I'd give two-stars.<br /><br />Stephen King is a literary genius, (IMO) and that fact is reflected better in his early work. But, like too many other writers, his newer books don't have the same 'grab you by the throat' or 'can't take your eyes off the page' that his early work had in abundance. Maybe even writers suffer from the Peter Principle....
B003L77FYS|5.0|I had to watch them all over 2 nights. Great, can't wait for the forth, and fifth seasons to see what they are up to next.
1577314808|5.0|This is a wonderful book and really shows us how we must learn to live in the &#34;Now.&#34;  It is difficult to do, but with practice it can be done and Eckhart Tolle does just that.  It is a book you will want to keep and read over and over again.
141659521X|5.0|I never had the pleasure to meet Vince but have read all his novel's and feel as though I did know him. As a recently retired Marine I salute Vince and in all heart felt sincerity say Semper FI Vince, you will be dearly missed. God bless you and your Family!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really fun interactive horse game! Just like taking care of a real horse! Also a bunch of fun mini games to play!
0449808696|5.0|This tells the truth - regarding big business and tobacco companies that have laundered their money into food products - so even if you don't buy cigarettes, if you buy the wonderful tasting oreo among other products - you are still supporting them. It shows that the food companies do not care about their responsibility - it is all on the consumer - as the consumers are educated and know there is sugar, salt and fat in these food products and can choose not to purchase or if purchase - don't have to eat the entire bag. It describes scientific research that helps stimulate the consumer to buy/eat more - and how advertising and presentation are important as well. The best option - is to do your grocery shopping around the outside ring of the store - fresh fruits/vegetables, lean meats, lean dairy and limit all processed foods as much as possible - which also makes the food choices more expensive financially and larger time commitment to prepare the food - hard in this economy for both.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|These rooms were apparently made by a paranoid architect with an elevator fetish, much like me. Easy to learn and hard to master. Add your positive cliches here.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Classic movie.  Has some bad words in it that not great for 7 year olds to hear.  But my son still loved it.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This is a movie for the whole family. I (a mother) saw this movie with my 7 year old son and he was laughing out loud in certain scenes (due to the minions mostly). This is a great movie with a great message. Parents and adults can both enjoy this movie together.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. For this being a free game I am really impressed! Lots of fun...Well worth the download.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I just loved the movie, who would've thought that the Great Oz was a cowardly person, always getting into trouble womanizing, then getting hooked with the half nice witch whom he gave his line of fantasy, promised her she'd be his queen, then broke her heart, which turned her into the wicked witch, I would recommend this movie to everyone, good clean fun & action.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This is definitely one of the Deftones \\"softer\\" albums, but it was my introduction to their music except for the single \\"Diamond Eyes\\".  LOVE Chino's vocals and the driving beat of the band, I can't get enough.  I have since gotten into their other albums because of this one.  Deftones are definitely in my top 5 all time favorite bands.  Even my 17 year old son (listens to Death Metal and such) likes them as he loves most things 8 strings.  I'm in my late 40's, shouldn't I be into Pop music???? HELL NO!  Tempest is my personal favorite.  I like that Chino writes abstract lyrics that you really have to listen to.  The only bad thing I can say about the album is that the Vocal seem a little over produced or \\"echoey\\" (if that's a word).  Perhaps that's the intent?  I don't know.....I still enjoyed it immensely!
B0044RFT8S|5.0|This is the start of the Trilogy of Madagascar.. after you see this one you have to see the second and third part.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A fantastic story full of historical information and well-developed characters. I loved how the author took me on a journey across Europe and America during World War I. I am looking forward to the sequel(s).
B005LAIGWS|3.0|I was waiting way more action that in the first part. Is a good movie but they lost the opportunity to do so much more.
B005SCSL56|4.0|I fell under the wishing spell and in love with this easy read. I enjoyed my journey with Alex and Conner, visiting the kingdoms while searching for beloved treasures from familiar fairy tales and hiding from favorite villains. I will enjoy reading it to my children, comparing it to the classics, and sharing another point of view.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|Just see the trailer and you will know you have to see it. The concept and the quality of the special effect are great
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting and fun game.  Good clues that make you pay attention...wish the levels were a little longer.  Can't wait for more levels.  Very addictive.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|It works great for what we wanted.  I would give it a five star.  This was bought for my wife as a gift.
B007US9NA8|5.0|This book is amazing. It covers all you need to know about training and the diferent exercises. I would buy it all over again.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|I call this a refresher album, similar to 808's and Heartbreak. Yeezy likes to put out an album everything now and then where he tests different genres kinda like a rough draft of influences far and wide. That being said, I still think this album has some great songs like &#34;Blood on the Leaves&#34; and &#34;New Slaves.&#34; Definitely worth checking out until he hits us with another big ass album like My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I loved this movie. The action was good and the story kept me entertained. The acting was very good as well. I would watch it again.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|It lags when I try to upgrade.<br /><br />On the other hand it's graphics are great.<br />I would reccomend this to 5-13yrs
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book kept one guessing thoughout the chapters. It was difficult to put down. Defending Jacob makes you wonder about issues it brought up and what one would do if faced with these situations (God forbid). IT is a must read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was very intrigued by Suzanne Collins`s writing. I have read the Gregorian the overloaded series, and it was just the same. Suzanne Collins`s writing is the best!
B000FBJF78|5.0|I read the series of this. They are a fun and light read. The books portray the lands of Africa and the various tribes and thier traits.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I think this game is really fun and definitely worth the money. A lot of people might complain that it's too hard but I think that a challenge is good. You don't want a game that's so easy to win that you're done in three minutes, that's no fun. I really like that you can aim with this game. I get much less frustrated and can enjoy the game much more. Lots of fun :) great game!!!
0307463745|5.0|The writer made a changes in interpreting what the mangement is. It give us a fresh way to run our business or run our life. Thanks for the writer.

B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Let me start by saying this is easily the best Slender game for kindle and other tablets,phones,etc.But it does have its obvious little errors which can be fixed.Two major ones(and the only real problems)are when I had 5/8 pages and there was a house with one door,and a few Windows.I was walking through the door when I fell through the map(forgot to mention it was farm~spoiler~).Another is when I was playing on road(or street,I forgot~another spoiler~)and I saw him...HE NOW HAS TENTACLES AFTER YOU COLLECT A FEW PAGES.Anyways,his feet were moving like Spongebob`s would if you ever played a Spongebob game.The best things though,have to be the jump scares and the way he ALWAYS is following you.Good job,I'm looking forward to your next installment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting.I feel like a detective when I play. Lol. It challenging but in a good way.I've played it all day.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Even though minecraft is a legitimate game, $6.99 is a lot of money and I think it's not worth the small amount of things it gives you.<br />Problems: I think the area should be bigger,on create mode you don't have enough in your inventory,and you don't have the option to change the mode,modify the world,or use cheats. Even though it's a great game, it isn't worth $6.99.
B00332CWLW|3.0|Kaleidoscopes generally don't work for me. The writer needs to over invest in characters that come and go. He then must come up with some ingenious way for them to intersect, weaving a story that we both want to read and that brings the disparate group of characters in touch with each other. And then he has to find some resolution that leaves the reader somewhat satisfied but knowing you can possibly tie up all the loose ends created by so many open ended storylines.<br /><br />He then needs the reader to invest in those characters only to see them fade as the next one takes the stage.<br /><br />It's frankly too ambitious.<br /><br />And in the the 21st century do we really need another story where the lives of street walking hookers intersect with Park Avenue's elite, Irish immigrants, pimps and judges, nurses, artists and doctors and everyone has a distinctive accent with their cultural rough edges from the new yawkah to those foreigners? Frankly \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" or any New Yorker article or novel by Tom Wolfe, George Plimpton, John Dos Passos or Jay McInerney or any next 10 great novelists of the last century have captured much of what McCann has tried to write here.<br /><br />In the end the McCann tries too hard to create great characters that should fill a whole book but only hold us for a chapter or 2. Unfortunately that's near impossible to invest in them or buy into each's connection to the next person. So then you just suspend belief and take faith in the Hail Mary that's been thrown out there to try and save the story and bring it home.<br /><br />The contradiction to all that is that I did like the characters but there were too many. I felt a bit shortchanged in how they quickly wrapped up. What was a story that was largely concrete ended with a bit too much metaphor and symbolism with a character, Jazzlyn, a woman we barely got to know is left to give it all meaning.<br /><br />Oh and the part about the tightrope walker? Interesting but hardly the glue or inspiration to bring all this together.the glue or inspiration to bring all this together.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun and creative game!! I love games that really make you think outside of the box and actually use your brain!!
0312379293|5.0|It's a great book.  You're sure the hero is going to outsmart evil.  You just don't know how!  A compelling and satisfying read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is really awesome! It's way better than going to an arcade to play this game. It is so addicting that you waste all your money when you go to a real arcade. This is a great substitute.
B005HEQ4XQ|4.0|Sometimes, a little \\"shark jumping\\" can be fun!  Some great quotes in the episode with Scotty that gently poke fun at TOS while still respecting and paying homage to it.

159463176X|5.0|When an author attains success such as Hosseini did with his first two books, a reader may expect a letdown of expectations. I think that is why some armchair reviewers are reading this wonderful book more critically than others. Had this been a first effort, 2 star reviews would probably be 5. As it is, Hosseini has written a saga with interwoven storylines that separate and converge in remarkable ways. It starts with a seemingly small incident that is momentous to those experiencing it, and comes full circle. That's all I'll say because its beauties must be discovered by each reader at the pace the author intends. He takes his time with his plots, and as he explained at a recent store appearance, won't submit anything that doesn't meet the high standards of his wife, his first reader. This book is so rich and evocative, it will merit more than one reading. And i don't say that often.(less)
0399165274|2.0|The Kill List resembles Forsyth's classic thriller, The Day Of The Jackal (which is one of my all-time favorites), in that the plot of each book involves the hunt for a for a world-class killer -- The Jackal in Forsyth's The Day Of The Jackal and the Preacher in The Kill List.<br /><br />However, this is where the resemblance ends for me. That is, unlike The Day Of The Jackal, The Kill List reads like a narrative report with dialogue kept to a minimum rather a story that enables the reader to feel that (s)he is \\"right there\\" in the middle of the action; it is virtually devoid of thrills, with the little suspense (if you want to call it that) not occurring until the last 50-75 pages or so; and its characters are not particularly well-developed and, thus, are not ones with which this reader could get particularly involved. Thus, despite the credit Forsyth deserves for the extensive amount of research he did, much of which he describes in this book, The Kill List makes for a tedious, often boring read.<br /><br />As you can tell from my comments above, I was quite disappointed in The Kill List; which is now the second book in a row of Forsyth's that I disliked. It seems that Forsyth is now rapidly traveling down the road to \\"No More No Way Street;\\" the road that several of my other one-time favorite authors have already gone down -- such as Nelson DeMille, Dean Koontz, Stephen King and James Patterson, to name a few.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|We love this show. Just started watching last week and have watched all 3 seasons already. Great writing, acting and production.
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|Stone Sour's fifth album, 2013's \\"House Of Gold And Bones (Part 2),\\" is, as its title implies, a continuation of the band's last record, \\"House Of Gold And Bones (Part 1).\\" It picks up where that 2012 effort left off from a lyrical standpoint (as this is also a highly conceptual assortment of songs), but it also continues in the same vein from a musical standpoint. Hence, these twelve tracks range from brutal, red-faced metal moshers (with some modern thrash influence) to proggy, restrained modern rock balladry.<br /><br />And while Stone Sour's songwriting talents still haven't changed noticeably (for the better), their instrumental abilities sure have. The band are clearly much more accomplished musicians this time around, as demonstrated by their newfound knack for uncannily complex picking and drumming. (I mean, for crying out loud, \\"Part 2\\" even finds S.S. messing around with some guitar soloing and near blast beat-esque drum patterns!)<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Red City,\\" which is partially a dark and morose ballad with a cool-sounding piano line, nice acoustic strumming, and soulful clean vocals, and partially a full-on metal song with unintelligible, roaring vocals and downtuned guitar aggression assailable to early Slipknot. \\"Sadist\\" is another highlight, as it is a dreary, dreamy, atmospheric ballad with dramatic drum fills, steady, beeping, grumbling bass notes, and vocals that are just plain stellar. But \\"House\\" then takes a turn towards the heavier side over the course of its next few tracks. \\"Peckinpah\\" is easily the record's heaviest song thus far, and it is backed by thrashy riffs, grumbling bass, and forceful, blasting drums. \\"Stalemate\\" is a surprisingly thunderous number that features some of the most technical musicianship heard from Stone Sour to date. The guitar work, in particular, is not exactly Converge-esque, but it is a start down an admirably precisely-played path, a path that will no doubt serve the band well on future releases (should they bring it back). It varies from crunchy, chugging power chords to moderately-technical leads to positively thrashy picking, and even flirts with some respectable soloing. And it is all furthered by some really deft drum fills, and topped off by another instantly memorable chorus. Finally, \\"Gravesend\\" continues this increasingly heavy tradition found on the more recent tracks by fusing in some killer, death metal-derived, brutal vocals (even if they are offset by another soaring -- and, thus, very contagious -- melodic chorus).<br /><br />\\"'82\\" is a later album standout as it is centered around siren-like guitar harmonies and really vehement vocals. And skipping ahead a track, we get \\"Blue Smoke,\\" an ambient, melodic piece that serves as the perfect lead-in to \\"Do Me A Favor,\\" an up-tempo hard rocker with irresistible, arena-ready hooks and mosh pit-worthy vocals and choruses. Then comes \\"The Conflagration,\\" an infectious tuneful, minor-key, and keyboard-based power ballad with decent melodic guitar soloing. Corey is, again, the main attraction, here, though, as he really pours his heart out into the mic, thus delivering a superbly-accomplished clean vocal performance. All of which makes \\"Conflagration\\" a big album standout, and possibly its finest melodic piece. But immediately following it, Stone Sour go right back to the heavy grind with the album's title track, a mosh-intensive set closer that comes across sounding not unlike `Knot's 2004 single \\"Before I Forget.\\"<br /><br />\\"Part 2\\" still fails to match the level of excellence that Stone Sour achieved on 2006's wonderful \\"Come What(ever) May.\\" And, again, it does not mark much of a substantial step forward for the band. But at the end of the day, none of that really matters because this is still a very, very good hard rock/alternative metal record, and one that should no doubt appeal to all fans of the genre while simultaneously satisfying S.S.'s increasingly rabid fanbase.hould they bring it back).

B007HACDLK|5.0|Another amazing book that I just couldn't put down. I can't wait for his next book coming out this fall!!!
B000063DFS|5.0|Since his original guitarist/founding member Randy Rhodes passed away in an airplane crash, one might have thought that Ozzy's solo career was over. But it wasn't. In fact, it was quite the opposite in that it was actually the start of something new -- a new chapter in his musical career. Now armed with a new guitar virtuoso, two new producers, and cleared of any wrongdoing for supposed suicidal messages in one of his songs, Ozzy Osbourne sounded reinvigorated on his sixth album proper, 1991's \\"No More Tears.\\" All of which make this a perfect way for Ozz to enter a new decade (the Nineties), but the fact that he enlisted the six-string talents of Zakk Wylde (who, at the time, was still relatively unknown, but was every-bit the fretboard wizard that Rhodes was), was probably the biggest factor in this equation.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Tinkertrain,\\" \\"Mama, I'm Coming Home,\\" \\"No More Tears,\\" \\"Time After Time,\\" and \\"Road To Nowhere\\" are all hit singles, thus making them obvious standout tracks. And they are even standout tracks in Ozzy's whole discography, as most of them are among the catchiest songs that the Ozzman has ever written. The former tune in this bunch is backed by strong and propulsive riffing, heavy, churning rhythms, and a blazing, off-the-rails solo, all of which come courtesy of Mr. Wylde. Next up, \\"Mama, I'm Coming Home\\" is a gorgeous acoustic-plucked ditty complete with a more melodic-than-usual solo and sweet-yet-never-sappy clean singing and almost poetic lyrics. The title song is also of note from a lyrical standpoint, but its main attraction has got to be the fact that it is quite possibly the album's heaviest song. And it has great riffs and ominously depressive bass lines that creep throughout. \\"Time After Time,\\" then, is a peaceful, and fairly ambient and restrained ballad; and so is the latter tune of the bunch, the introspective \\"Road To Nowhere,\\" which, despite its stellar melodic solo work, is still livelier and more up-tempo and hard-rocking than most ballads.<br /><br />And \\"I Don't Want To Change The World,\\" whose fiery, crunching licks smoking solo flights, and effortlessly catchy, sing-songy choruses, make it a surefire contender to be a hit single (although it was never made into one), and another instant Ozzy classic, is another.  Others include the solid riff chunks and lengthy, shredding solo that occupy most of \\"Desire\\"; \\"S.I.N.,\\" which features another infectious vocal hook that will tattoo itself to the listener's brain (just try to get \\"Oooh, who turned out the light?\\" out of your head!), as well as two more awesomely mazy and wailing guitar solos; the positively catchy bass line that underpins \\"Hellraiser\\"; and the darn-near danceable \\"Zombie Stomp.\\" Of course, not every song can be as great as these, and a couple of the tracks near the end (i.e. \\"A.V.H.\\" and \\"Don't Blame Me\\") end up falling kind of flat. They aren't bad inclusions by any means, and they both certainly rock sufficiently hard; but at the end of the day, neither one is much to write home about. Fortunately, if you buy the 2002 reissue of this album (and you no doubt will, as the original version is hard to come by anymore), you will be treated to \\"Party With The Animals,\\" a feel-good, fun-loving heavy rocker that ensures the record goes out on a strong and memorable note.<br /><br />Ozzy will probably never top his solo debut, 1980's \\"Blizzard Of Ozz,\\" but once you own that (and you DO own that, right?), you're gonna want to check out some more of his other works. And when you reach that stage, \\"No More Tears\\" should be at or near the top of the list of Ozzy albums to get. It is a great record, and a definite standout in Mr. Osbourne's discography, as it just might be the best thing he ever recorded with Zakk.most ballads.<br /><br />And \\"I Don't Want To Change The World,\\" whose fiery, crunching licks smoking solo flights, and effortlessly catchy, sing-songy choruses, make it a surefire contender to be a hit single (although it was never made into one), and another instant Ozzy classic, is another.

B00026WU7I|5.0|Hadn't listened to the entire album in a long time. 1975 = Patti Smith's &#34;Horses&#34;, John Cale's &#34;Slow Dazzle&#34;...2 years before the Sex Pistols we have 'Idiot Wind.' Not an insult towards (an-) other nor bile spit out mindlessly; rather, in keeping with the album's title maybe, the same old wounds, surfacing particularly violently - virulently rather, the voice having lost some of the hope (humour?) of more famous 1960s albums.  Lyrically impeccable, this is a painful reminder perhaps, but one of Mr. Z. 's records I shall listen to more frequently these days. Love songs, blood on the tracks. &#34;A pain that stops and starts/ Like a corkscrew to my heart/ Ever since we've been apart...&#34; Thank you.
1878424777|4.0|The book starts off a little mystical for me but the foundation of the 4 agreements is right on the mark. If we could only train ourselves to live our lives within the 4 agreements. I have no doubt that we would all lead more healthy, happy lives. The book is easy to and quick to read but calls to be read over and over again to really digest the concepts. I've been through it 4-5 times and continue to take items away. Well worth the investment of time and money.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|A gift for a very busy husband and wife who  wanted to watch all three seasons of Downton Abbey in their own time.  They love the ebb and flows of the many stories and find the series fascinating in terms of historical commentary.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|One of the best movies we have ever seen!  I would recommend this to any father/mother/son/daughter.  It will make you laugh, cry, and want to be a better person.
B0061S073A|5.0|This is a great app. A must for parents of young children. My son has already bought numerous expansions, new modules, and ancillary add-ons on my wife's I-pad; but this app blocks it all. Really great job by the developers.
B005LAII80|5.0|I was not expecting much, but I was blown away by the overall feel and excellent delivery.  Karl Urban captured the essence of Dredd.
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|This set is amazing, offered at an absolutely FAIR price (I know, gasp!!!), and to be completely honest is my favorite Monster High duo set *and* classrooms set so far! (On a side note, LOVING all the new duos, but why didn't Mattel release these sets in conjunction with the High School playset?!?!?)<br /><br />The Mad Science set itself is pretty barebones when compared to Lagoona's original Mad Science set (the full version with the locker): there are various beakers, one diary shared by both Ghoulia and Cleo (just being there is most of the work, natch!), two black stands, and one shared black brush (for Cleo's exclusive use of course).  HOWEVER, what will knock your socks off are the true to character outfits!  Ghoulia is back to wearing her brains on her, well... sleeves in this version. Her red lips are a shade darker than other versions as well, and I L-O-V-E her laced-up saddle wedges as well as the return of her white cateye glasses! I at first dismissed her dress as a re-do of the one included in the 2013 double Fashion Pack, but nope! I was wrong and her dress is an awesome print of the Periodic Table of Elements and goes so well with the brain-trimmed lab coat!!! How perfect can she get?!?!  Now about Cleo... W-O-W!!! Her lips are a shade of purple/burgundy, which I have yet to see Cleo wear... very \\"Goth,\\" but it really goes amazingly well with the purple streak in her bangs. Yep, A PURPLE STREAK!! Cleo's dress, wrappings, and slides are fairly standard and remind me ALOT of her Scaris outfit. Both Cleo's custom gold snake lab goggles and her wrap-trimmed lab coat make her a must-have. The earrings on both seem chintzy at first glance, BUT actually round out the scientic elements theme.<br /><br />I usually stress the importance of shopping around for the best price before giving in to 3rd party temptation, BUT I just couldn't wait this time and didn't even think twice about obviously overpaying (even by such a small amount). I ended up paying the full \\"suggested retail\\" price of thirty-two ninety-nine which is hands-down a GREAT price for this set! Of course, two days after my order (today, the day I received these science ghouls) Amazon has this currently listed for twenty-eight and change. Target lists the set for twenty-nine ninety-nine as well, but it's on \\"3-4 week back order.\\" Aside from the simple awesomeness of TWO new Mad Science dolls, the fact that my kiddo has this exact same tshirt from Walmart [[ASIN:B00ANEXMP8 Monster High Brains & Beauty Girls T-shirt]] (try to order direct instead of paying 3x the price!) just makes this buy a no brainer!\\"suggested retail\\" price of thirty-two ninety-nine which is hands-down a GREAT price for this set!

B000LTAY1U|5.0|A gift for my husband.  He loves the watch.  He wanted an automatic, no batteries.  The color is great and the watch face matches.<br />The metal of the watch is matte and looks very good.  It's been keeping perfect time.  Glad I bought it for him and the price was great.
044654146X|5.0|Profound analysis of basic principles to be innovative, illustrated with real world cases written in a very clear form.<br /><br />It is a very interesting book, that should be read to understand the thinking and principles of Israeli creativity and innovation in many areas of sciense. It reflects reality in Israel.<br /><br />Perhaps can help reduce racist beliefs that are completely irrational.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|If arcade game characters were alive this is probably how they would probably exist?<br />Their lives are just as perilous like ours.
B00821OX98|5.0|i love all characters. Its the best sci-fi tv series I've seen so far. Wait till you see the next season...
014242613X|5.0|I bought it for my grandson. He loved it. He bought the next one. I love all of Grisham's books.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Absolutely loved it!  Saw it in the theater when it came out and had to have a copy!  Okay, the voices are not always perfect (I've discussed this a lot with some who did not care for it) but the actors performances outdo anything else (except perhaps the Liam Neeson non-musical version) and the arrangements of the music are fantastic!  As to the vocals, if you are into the story enough to empathize with the actor their voices become much more soulful and endearing than any of the other performances (by trained voices) that I have witnessed.  Anne Hathaway deserved the Oscar (shortest time on the screen for the Award?) and Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe deserved one if anything for their courage to sing alongside the trained voices the film also features (who also performed beautifully)!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|This album is my favorite album of the year.  I play the entire album from start to finish...no skipping.  Rhianna deserves a Grammy for this album.  Its her best album to date.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so cool,  needs lots and lots more levels, they need to be just a little more difficult, just a little lol.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really really fun couldnt stop playing it. only 7 levels wish there were more. addicting and fun similar to 100 floors but better in some ways
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun responsive game. Allows different levels of play.pop -ups a good time to rest and refocus eyes.would recommend to others to pass time while waiting. Price is right!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Gameplay is approximately 10 minutes. Easy setup. easy enough for a five year old to understand (and sometimes wins), but interesting enough for older kids/adults. Quality materials (but had to glue one end of the tube shut so dice wouldn't fly with vigorous shaking)
1469226405|5.0|Kate Morton is a remarkable author and I loved all her books and listen too many of them on CD and love her reader \\"Caroline Lee\\".  The \\"The Distant Hours\\" was the last book I heard and I almost cried when it ended and I have read all her others and need more from her.  Listening to Caroline reader her stories adds something you never get out of the books.  The characters are so rich and real and there is so much history in her books.  Try one on CD.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This was a very endearing read. Yes, it was a 'feel good' book (as it is marketed) too, but mostly I found myself reflecting on my own life and people I know. Well worth a read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game! Challenging but it can be solved; you just need to put you thinking cap on!  Can't. wait until more levels are available!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|As a rule, I tend to avoide psychological thrillers. Unfortunately, Gone Girl kept coming up in conversations with people and when I finally read it, I loved it! It's really well written, has a clever plot and kept surprising me. Well done, Gillian Flynn - I'll be looking for more from you in the future!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have always loved games like this. These games always keep m me on my toes and thinking. It was easy and hard at the same time. I used to play stuff like this on my computer and now it's nice to know I can play it whenever I go
B00A757EFW|2.0|tried playing this but just can't seem to get into it. Maybe if I try to play more I might.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The story was gripping, the characters were real and unforgettable.  I also got some insight into the life of Muslim women.  Didn't want the book to end.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I've just started playing this so it may grow on me. The re-shuffling makes it easier to win the games. I like how the the progression of more tiles on each round goes.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My favorite workout DVD.  Work up to level three, but still get an awesome workout in level one.  20 minutes which is essential for me bc I have limited time with a baby.  I'm seeing great results and am thrilled with this DVD.  Jillian is awesome.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked this book for his vivid narrative about l;ife in Afganistan and how brutal it can be on individuals lives.  It is not as good as his earlier books Kite Runner and 1000 splendid suns in that he did not spend as much time in afganistan as he does narrating the characters living abroad.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Great game. Lots of fun......... but is slow to respond on my Kindle Fire. When I play the Red Alarm I have to use my Galaxy S4.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|A great movie.<br />I loved it.<br />It is movie making at it's best.<br />See it! You will be glad you did.
1416955070|5.0|Was a Great book. It had all kinds of fictional creatures, a good story line, even a love triangle. Some of the book was predictable but you'll want to read the series to straiten things out.
