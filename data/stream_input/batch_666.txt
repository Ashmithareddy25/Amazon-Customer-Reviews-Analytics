B000FVBLEI|5.0|I actually found out bout ALL THAT REMAINS on the Zen of screaming DVD, so I thought I'd check them out. I bought \\"This Darkened Heart\\" and although the cd was good, I wasn't entirely blown away. Enter \\"The Fall of Ideals\\" I can't tell you how impressed I am, I am completly dumbfounded by how awesome these guys have gotten! They melodies are more beautiful & the heavy parts more brutal. And awesome balance if you ask me.  <br />Tracks to check out: <br />This Calling, Whispers (I hear you)... and then everything else!
B000KCHZK6|3.0|Not Too Late would be fine if it were Norah's first, but I'm afraid we have all been spoiled by her first two efforts. Tracks lack the verve and charm of her past work, and lyrics are sometimes trite and colorless. Even after repeated listenings, I can't get past the \\"3.\\"

B000BT97AO|5.0|I saw Mirrormask for the first time via my Netflix subscription. I had problems with the disk, so I was only able to view the first half or so. That didn't matter. It was plenty of time to decide this was a movie I had to own, and that's saying quite a lot. I don't buy many. <br /> <br />Mirrormask is a *gorgeous* movie. The artwork is just stunning. It's like watching a dream. Hey, it's a Henson production, what would you expect? <br /> <br />The story is very storybook oriented. Not the deepest plot ever conceived but it's not lacking in details; and the characters are very entertaining. Great for kids and adults alike. <br /> <br />I don't actually have kids, mind you, but if i did, I can only hope and pray they'd choose this to watch over and over - ad infinitum - instead of some of the other junk kids get wrapped up in. Instead of feeling like they were having their brain slowly sucked out of their eyeballs, I'd feel they were being infused with a healthy dose of imagination and wonder. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, and the price! I got this thing for under $11. This is a STEAL. It is unbelievable that I can own a cinematic treasure like this for under $11. Seriously. Some of the best money you'll ever spend. If you have  a single bone in your body that values true creativity, buy this. <br /> <br />J. <br />

6305388458|1.0|With by far the majority raving over this trite and predictably British schoolyard humour since its release, I would hardly ever have called it 'controversial'. <br />Seems the vocal Christians were surprisingly mum over this one. Could have sent this 5 star rating down a few pegs if they'd spoken up against what they would have called mockery and blasphemy.
0812550706|5.0|Though I love this book, I think I have an objective opinion for several reasons, though you can infer them by reading my comments below. <br /> <br />  I came to Ender's Game initially without any preconceptions.  The only reason I read it was because it was the only \\"modern\\" scifi book on my high school required reading list. When I read the back of the book, however, my heart sank since it didn't sound like anything I would want to read. Nonetheless, it sounded more interesting than the other books.  To my surprise, once I starting reading it, I couldn't put it down. For me, it was the development and discovery of Ender that compelled me.  Seeing the process by which he figured things out and learned from other's mistakes was fascinating to me.  Additionally, I found myself yearning to see him undo his misconceptions about the adults around him and realize that he was valued by them for more than just what he could do, but for who he was.  And yet even when we saw the evidence of this at the end, there was still that mistrust in him that continued to tug at my heart.  <br /> <br />  That was back in 1986-87. <br /> <br />  I enjoyed it so much that I decided to read Speaker for the Dead even though it would be \\"extra\\" reading on top of the high school list I had.  It was very different from Ender's Game, but so much was revealed about the first book, that I had to re-read Ender's Game just so I could see it from the \\"insider\\" view. I enjoyed it just as much as the first time - even more, because of the new insight I had from reading Speaker. <br /> <br />  Since then, I have read it five or six times. Sometimes, for my own enjoyment, other times because I was reading with others. I have read it to my middle school students and allowed them to take \\"parts\\" to read out loud, too.  Many of these students ended up getting a copy of their own so they wouldn't have to wait for class to find out what would happen next.  I have read it to my son (10 at the time), who recently re-read it and is now reading all the sequels.   <br /> <br />  Now, I am a scientist and still enjoy reading it.  I have read it with other adults, many of whom also appreciate the insight into developing leadership skills and manipulation of the human psyche that this book affords.  Each person I have discussed it with has their own slant on it, making it all the more fun to read again. I have never been able to re-read any book all the way through except this one. <br /> <br /> This book is a lesson, above all, about interpersonal relationships, both intimate and shallow, just like they are in the real world.  Most of us only have a few \\"best\\" friends (well developed characters), and the rest of the people in our lives are scaffold.  This book isn't a soap opera about every character Card happens to mention.  It is a focused analysis of the human condition - its savage will to progress contrasted with it's empathy for others.  By the end, it makes you wonder if that is what makes us sentient - our empathy, and the other is what makes us human - our savagery.
B0002DB52M|5.0|When seeing 'Dogville' for the first time, I didn't know what to expect. I was just excited because Nicole Kidman plays the lead. So, with an open mind I watched 'Dogville.' And boy, I'm glad I did. 'Dogville' is extremely original. The 'scenery' or rather absence of it makes a great commentary on small town life. Nicole Kidman is, of course, wonderful, as is the whole ensemble cast. I feel that this film and its cast is so very underrated and should have been more widely acknowledged. The ending was a true twist that you don't see coming, making it even more disappointing when it's over.
0340839937|4.0|I hadn't read 'Dune' cover to cover in more than twenty years. I must say that it holds up. I couldn't put the thing down.<br /><br />Yes, there are problems. An editor might have trimmed some of the 'terrible purposes' and 'plans within plans within plans' and other repetitions, and sometimes the mystical-messianic stuff sticks in the throat. But few books rival Herbert's for sheer inventiveness and conviction. Not to mention that he seems to think that readers are intelligent people who like books that make them pay attention.<br /><br />Is it the Greatest Science Fiction Novel Ever? No.(That title goes to 'The Left Hand of Darkness'). But it is a classic. Anyone who has an interest in serious sci-fi needs to read it.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|And referring to \\"great,\\" I'm talking about the 1981 version starring Timothy Dalton. That version was the definative 'Jane Eyre.' This version, from Masterpiece Theatre, is good. It adds vision and style to the story, and the scenery is lovely, it just misses something... I suppose growing up with the 1981 version, I'm a little biased, but I'll admit that the Masterpiece Theatre version is good.<br /><br />For the great version, see the 1981 version. For the good version, see this one!
0679861750|1.0|First, this is only the first half of \\"Little Women.\\" Yes, this is the book originally published under that title, but usually it is bundled with the sequel, \\"Good Wives.\\" This volume only covers the period up to Meg's wedding. <br /> <br />Second, this adaptation has taken all the color out of the work. The descriptions of the girls and their friends are missing, as are descriptions of their clothes, home, etc. Alcott herself wrote (ch. 1), \\"...young readers like to know 'how people look.'\\" I question the decision to leave out the descriptive passages as they are some of the most interesting writing, especially to younger readers.

NOTHING is ever as good as the books! <br />because when you read a book you imagine the words you are reading and picture it the way you want it to look! so there is NO way any director can reach into the minds of millions of people and make the movie identicle to that! <br /> <br />it was a great movie, get over it!

B00064WSNW|5.0|I am not a huge Crimson fan.  I heard this album first when I was 18, an impressionable age to be sure.  I know Court of the Crimson King, Red, Thrak, etc., but this is my personal favorite line up and, perhaps, Crimson's best album.  Adrian Belew, fresh from tours with Zappa and the Talking Heads, infuses the band with polyrythmic intensity and Afro-Brazilian beats.  His voice is rather limited and an acquired taste.  Tony Levin (Peter Gabriel, California Guitar Trio) holds down a nasty, Chapman Stick-infused bottom (and adds some great aural textures),while Bill Bruford (Yes, XTC, Earthworks) provides amazing, frenetic fills.  This group has the chops to compete with guitarist Robert Fripp and the result is some incredible, moody  music.  The opener, Elephant Talk, is a funny, funky dance beat of a song (and I don't associate Crimson with funny, but I think Belew brings some much needed levity to this album, in counterpoint to lead guitarist Robert Fripp's pretentiousness).  Frame By Frame follows with dueling guitars and soaring vocals - a real mind bender. Matte Kudasai is a pretty ballad with wailing seagull guitars; and if you purchase the newest edition, you get a second version of the song with a Fripp solo.  Indiscipline is a mad, head-splitting romp (though it doesn't make your ears bleed like the double trio Crimson).  Thela Hun Ginjeet (still covered by Primus/Les Claypool) is a rollicking, bouncy joy.  The final two tracks, Sheltering Sky and Discipline, are very strong.  Sheltering Sky is a personal favorite, with Bruford using a slit drum to great effect; the percussion, the weird Chapman Stick rumblings and the Frippertronics all blend seamlessly into a wonderfully hypnotic whole.  You will either love or leave this disc, and it likely depends on your age and your exposure to Crimson.  For me, Discipline is one of the top 100 pop releases of all time.  I think it still sounds remarkably fresh.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|Yeah.............Eric, all that & more.  But wasn't this outing where Brian May discovered that Paul Rodgers could more than adequiately sing, and score him for the \\"Queen + PR\\" thing?  And a vote:  Hubert Sumlin is worth the price of admission, anytime, anywhere.  Johns Mayer/Lang just prove the hypothesis that Rock and Roll did, indeed, die, Aug. 16, 1977.  Remember: Hubert Sumlin.  That's all you need to know.
B000K4WPCC|1.0|Oh God what an awful movie - one of the worst I have ever seen.  HORRIBLE acting, even by my boy Taylor Kitsch - from Friday Night Lights - who I watched this crapfest for.  Certainly he doesn't disappoint in the shirtless scenes, but sadly even those aren't worth the time spent suffering through this. <br /> <br />As others have said, the premise has promise - but the writing and acting are just so cringe-worthy that the whole thing is close to unwatchable.  Don't waste your money - it wasn't even worth the $3 I spent watching it on pay per view.  Really craptacular garbage, and I'm sure an embarassment to all involved.
B00005AQE8|5.0|If you only purchase one rap album in your life, make sure it's this one. <br /> <br />There's not much else I can say - buy the CD and listen to it.
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|This album is a guilty pleasure - of sorts.  Wolfmother unabashedly rips of 70s rock with a lick here and there from Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Iron Butterfly, etc...  While it is nice to hear someone run a Fender Rhodes and an Organ through Marshals again the horrid lyrics full of 30 year old clichés kills the album.  \\"Rainbows tinted with gold\\", \\"said the joker is a wanted man / makes his way across the land / see him sifting through the sands / said I'd tell you all a story about the joker and the thief in the night\\"...  Come on...  While I had no expectation of grand insights or artful poetry, this just stinks. <br /> <br />
B000M5AJQI|5.0|This is a great movie that is definitely worth owning becuase you could watch it several times. I have not looked at the extras on the disc so I can't comment on those. My only complaint is that the aspect ratio does not match a standard widescreen TV so it is still letterboxed. Other than that, it looked great.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I own this DVD and have read most of the reviews here.  The majority say the film is delightful with great animation, decent vocal performance, and a sweet message; but a few have reservations about the storyline toward the end.  However, it seems a fair number of folks think they must warn others about the \\"liberal\\" message this film tries to deliver to our kids.  It's as if we must be afraid that because the penguin elders take a \\"theological\\" stance and shun Mumble, somehow our children will instantly realize that it's better to be \\"humane\\" and tolerant (liberal) toward those who are different than to be a intolerant, cold-hearted butthead (conservative).  Holy, moly!  Hurry everyone; let's ban this picture before any more innocents are lost!  Give me a break!      I suppose these folks are concerned that (even in the form of an animated movie) exposing children to situations where the morally and ethically depraved point of view is ultimately proven wrong will turn them away from their conservative \\"values.\\" Oh and let us not forget that the eco-friendly message in this film is part of the vast Hollywood-backed, liberal conspiracy to make tree-huggers out of your children. But hey, this picture is rated PG; that means parental guidance is recommended.  Maybe they're just too busy to answer their kids questions about such basic issues.      I don't see these as religious, liberal, or conservative issues, they're morality issues. All kids need their parents to provide moral guidance, and if a film helps the parent explain moral conundrums, that's a good thing.  If the neo-cons' moral foundations are so weak that they can't defend their positions to their own children, perhaps they should join Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.  I understand they are all about the one-belief system and the suppression of all other ideologies.    Update:  I'm sorry if my initial review offended the conservatives who aren't sheep. Obviously, some of you still have the capacity for independentthought.     At any rate, thanks for the kind comments. Enjoy the movie and all your delightfully intolerant opinions of me.  You're entitled to yours, as I am to mine.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|The sixth year of this century would go down as a year when all the old horses gave what they got  .. and finshed with astonishing results.  Stones rolled, Plant grew, Paul resurrected and Bobbie proved again that he ain't gonna leave the building quietly.   <br /> <br />For us, who started listening to Dylan in mid to late eighties, that's a real treat.   <br /> <br />I remember growing up in Calcutta, when listening  to counter culture classics and watching Ray movies meant the coolest thing in the world ( a far cry from today's decadent mainstream behaviour, you see), and Dylan was crawling through a dark decade.  Darkest were the years when we saw releases like Knocked Out Loaded and Down In The Groove.  Both got issued on vinyl LPs which we promptly procured with our pocket money, little that we had, only to realize that these recordings did not stand a chance agains the earlier gems of the previous decades (way before the times of online reviews and thirty second intros on itunes, you had to buy to listen to judge .   <br /> <br />We did not realize that as much we anticipate masterworks from the living legends everytime, it's just not possible to deliver a classic everytime you happen to be in the studio.   <br /> <br />I, for one, had given up.  Content with what I had from the sixties & seventies.   <br /> <br />Keeping that in mind the new resurgence of Mr. Dylan appears both fantastic and spectacular.  I have not had a chance to write reviews on the the earlier two studio albums: Time Out of Mind and Love & Theft, both classics and will stand the test of time much like Highway 61 or Blood on Tracks.   <br /> <br />It would appear, at least to me, that Bob, in his sixties and reliving the sixties.  Backed by a class act, second maybe only to 'The Band' in the seventies, he tears through a collection that matches with the best in class.  <br /> <br />If the younger buckaroos are producing music half as good as this, forty years on, I will consider myself tobe damn lucky.    <br /> <br />As for the album, many many words have been spent in reviewing Modern Times (the best that I have read was on Uncut, a British magazine).  I don't have any intention to rehash the same .. it's a great album, Dylsn's third classic in a row and consider yourself fortunate that you are sharing your mortal time with Dylan, and that he has not stopped amusing you.   <br /> <br />Keep on rolling, Abraham!! Modern Times, whatever may that be, both for you and me .. this is our time!!
B0001CCY7E|5.0|This has always been one of the highlights of my soundtrack collection. Finally, I have the version that should have been released back in 1990. Why, oh why, oh WHY did it take 14 years for the real version to come out? And why did the producers of the original CD see fit to alter the brilliance of the original 'Buffalo Hunt' cue? Did they think soundtrack collectors would prefer a repeat of track 1? Well, finally great moments in film music history are available. The Buffalo Hunt would have to be one of filmdom's great musical 5 minutes. Other expanded cues bring tears to the eyes and shivers up the spine. <br /> <br />If you love John Barry's music, or collect soundtracks, then buy this now! If you bought the original 1990 release, throw it away and replace it with this version NOW! As other reviewers have said, this should be the cornerstone of all soundtrack collections.

B00002SSKI|5.0|Great Movie! Great Music! Great story line! This fabulous film begins in the present, introduces the four main adult characters, and slips back  <br />to the summer they were 12 yrs. old, and made the pact that has brought them together now.   This is a story about growing up and into yourself. <br />  'Now and Then' is deliciously well-cast, in both the adult and 12 yr. old roles, and very well presented. And for me, very vivid! (As I was 12 then, and even live to tell the tale...*). <br />   While I classify this as a family friendly movie, I definately recommend it for  mother/daughter/grand-daughter/babysitter connections. <br />   Happy viewing!!! <br />
B00025G2K0|4.0|A taut, clever tale brimming with backstory, 2003's \\"The Avenger\\" is a nice return to form for Frederick Forsyth, recalling if not attaining his \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" peak and showing there's life in the old boy yet.<br /><br />Attorney Calvin Dexter lives quietly and alone in Pennsylvania after the deaths of his daughter and his wife. Unknown to everyone else, he leads a second life as self-styled \\"Avenger\\" for hire, calling upon skills honed as a tunnel rat in Vietnam to help other grieving families achieve closure by bringing those who have hurt them to justice. He needs all those skills when he takes on ex-Serbian paramilitary boss Zoran Zilic, whose Bond-villain name comes with a coastal fortress Blofeld might call home.<br /><br />Reading Forsyth of late has been a disappointing experience for me; I picked up this book not knowing what to expect. \\"Icon\\" and \\"Fist Of God,\\" his previous two novels, started strong only to peter out, hobbled by excessive exposition and plots that unfolded too neatly, drained of suspense. \\"Avenger\\" has a lot of exposition, and a neat wrap-up, yet it actually works very well this time, in part because Forsyth's writing has tightened and also because he has a real story to tell, one that resonates in the same way as his early classics.<br /><br />The plot is engaging like \\"Jackal\\" because you don't quite know what the protagonist is up to. In \\"Avenger,\\" like \\"Jackal,\\" you are given a lead character operating alone and in secret, the differences being that Calvin Dexter is a sympathetic figure and known to you by name. We spend a good deal of time seeing Dexter in the time before his current life began, including a terrific sequence explaining the whole Tunnel Rat idea. A bit more exposition than needed, perhaps, especially when we travel to Dunkirk in 1940, but that's Forsyth's style, something his fans enjoy and others should allow for.<br /><br />When the book begins to take off, however, it really soars, especially when the CIA gets involved. Zilic, see, is no ordinary exiled baddie, but one who has connections in the global underworld. And there's one man in particular who, as August turns into September of 2001, that CIA counter-terrorism boss Paul Devereaux would like Zilic's help in eliminating.<br /><br />Devereaux is a complicated figure. He'd be the villain in almost anyone else's book, no question, as he works to keep Zilic safe. But Forsyth is wrestling with the problem of how to fight evil in today's world, and poses the question to the reader in an interesting way. This gives \\"Avenger\\" a kind of twist that makes it special in the Forsyth canon. Does the end justify the means? Is it better to leave Zilic to prey on his dozens of innocent victims to stop someone else from preying on hundreds of thousands?<br /><br />Forsyth doesn't present any easy answers, just a tough story that keeps you reading. Dexter's confrontation with Zilic feels rushed, and it seems Forsyth could have done more with it than he did. Like the whole Avenger identity, you don't exactly buy it, but you enjoy it just the same. It's easy work enjoying Forsyth this time around, and hopefully there's more to come as Forsyth rediscovers the balance between giving history lessons and a ripping good yarn.inary exiled baddie, but one who has connections in the global underworld.

0618680004|5.0|Wow! I am still reeling from the after-effects of reading this book but in a good way. I found this book to be very profound in it's arguments and very mature in the way it presents them to the general public. One may disagree with some of the arguments but it's hard to ignore them. The clarity of the author's insights into the issue at hand is apparent in every single page of the book. <br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know or is curious to find out about the atheist view point of the world. <br />
0786177888|5.0|Francie Nolan is a young Irish-American girl who lived in an ethnic slum in Brooklyn around the turn of the century. The story covers her turbulant childhood with little money and alcoholic father. It tells of the menial work her mother did each day as a housekeeper to keep the family together because her father could not hold down a steady job. Even though it was tough for the family, Francie was kept in school until High School so that she would become educated and not have to wash floors for a living like her mother. Also Francie was intelligent, idealistic and hard-working. She became very successful as she matured and got her first real job. The story is one of hope that will inspire all who read it. It illustrates the American Dream fulfilled through hard work and perserverance.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Blasting everything at peak volume and squeezing in bombast until the seams are nearly bursting, Gerald Way and My Chemical Romance revisit everything that was great about the seventies and eighties. \\"The Black Parade\\" pays homage to everyone from Queen (the title track), Pink Floyd (\\"Mama,\\" with Liza Minelli adding an over-the-top cameo, sounds right off \\"The Wall\\") and Alice Cooper (the whole idea of death as a macabre reason to party loud) without losing the band's identity.<br /><br />One of the coolest things about MCR is that - even through the bombast - they never lose track of a good melody. The title track turns back the clock to a childhood memory as viewed from the deathbed. \\"Cancer\\" is the kind of song Bob Ezrin and Alice Cooper would have had a field day with; the only thing missing is a kiddie chorus and this would have been a Kiss song. \\"Teenagers\\" is an hysterical sing-along with a really dark underbelly. It's hard to tell where the truth ends and the punchline starts, which is what makes it truly great.<br /><br />Like \\"American Idiot,\\" Green Day's masterwork from 2004, \\"The Black Parade\\" is a slice of living in the USA in the post 9/11 world. Darkly funny and obsessed with death while celebrating life, My Chemical Romance are maturing at a rate that is near astonishing. \\"Disenchanted\\" and \\"Famous Last Words\\" are the kind of songs I would have expected from a band after a couple of decades and not on their third album.<br /><br />\\"I am not afraid to keep on living,<br />I am not afraid to walk this world alone.<br />Honey, if you stay I'll be forgiven.<br />Nothing you can say can stop me going home.\\"<br /><br />It's enough to bring a tear to your eye and pull out that old double vinyl copy of \\"The Wall.\\" I think these guys are officially my new favorite band.

He assembled a first rate cast, with every member at a perfect pitch. Christian Bale is spot on as the troubled billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. When you view the series, it has always been how the actors play Bruce as the straightman, and not as a caped crime fighter. Michael Keaton was terrific in his fashion, while I was always of the opinion that Val Kilmer was the smoothest of the bunch and George Clooney could have been perfect had he not been saddled with the horrific script dumped off as \\"Batman And Robin.\\"<br /><br />More to the point is that the supporting cast also carries through on their characters. Of particular note are Liam Neeson as Ducard and Gary Oldham, almost unrecognizable as (not quite Commissioner) Jim Gordon. There's enough light moments in the script to match the darkness, and Morgan Freeman's inventions make for good action.<br /><br />The reason I picked this set up, however, was the special booklet. With three stories to choose from, it is a load of fun. One is from 1989, the second is the Bob Kane introduction from 1939 Detective Comics, and the third an introductory chapter from \\"The Long Halloween.\\" It made the extra bucks (and the five star rating) worth adding on.

B000BGR0OM|4.0|Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart were the ultimate in New Wave 80's sound. Sleek and robotic, danceable and rocking, cold and soulful all mixed with an uncanny effortlessness. It was impossible to not be moved by Annie's voice and emotional range, and Dave's studio razzle-dazzle made their best singles just pop from the radio. (Or MTV, where \\"Sweet Dreams\\" made its initial impression.)<br /><br />Their ongoing albums increased in scope and sophistication. Where \\"[[ASIN:B0000CFXNR Be Yourself Tonight]]\\" was (imho) their best album, Eurythmics were also capable of making a slamming concept album (\\"Savage\\") and a good soundtrack for \\"1984.\\" (Which is, once again, conspicuous in its absence.) Even the reunion of \\"Peace\\" gave us the terrific \\"17 Again\\" and \\"I Saved The World Today,\\" used brilliantly on an episode of \\"The Sopranos.\\"<br /><br />The only reason I hold this from 5 stars is the inexcusable absence of any singles from \\"We Too Are One.\\" At the very least, \\"Don't Ask Me Why,\\" the group's last Top 40 single, should have been here. I guess we're just going to have to wait for the inevitable double disc best of to arrive for that to happen. But till then, \\"Ultimate Collection: Eurythmics\\" and the re-mastered and re-issued albums will fill in nicely. (Exception, \\"Peace\\" was remixed for god knows what reason.)

B000002TLX|4.0|Richard Marx is well-known for his sappy ballads much more than for his attempt at rock music. This compilation is a good summation of his talents, as most of the album is focused on his popular ballads that became his signature hits. \\"Endless Summer Nights\\" is more of an up-tempo ballad, but ended up as one of his biggest hits. The rhythmic tempo, along with nice background melody makes for a nice song to relax to. \\"Angelia\\" is another one of his hits that became popular, despite it sounding different than his more traditional-sounding ballads. If you prefer the traditional style of ballads, accompanied by nice piano sounds, \\"Right Here Waiting\\" and \\"Until I Find You Again\\" are nice ones to listen to. \\"Hold On To The Night\\" is a nice ballad as well, with more of a soothing background than the piano-focused sounds of his other hits. In all, this album is a nice compilation of Richard's softer hits, which were more popular than his up-tempo tracks. With this album, you probably won't find too much need to buy any of his other albums. Check it out!

B000MNP2KI|4.0|In general, Bond films are bona-fide cutural products of their time. Thus, Craig make a good Bond for time being: gritty, edgy, and trigger-happy. This, by far, is a different and darker Bond than what old timer like myself perceived him to be.  Another reviewer is comparing Craig to Statham in \\"The Transporter\\" and I must admit that's exactly what I was thinking of, especially during the fight scene.  Don't get me wrong, I totally approve Craig doing lots of his own action scene, and also, very impressed with the realistic action overall in lieu of the flashy computer graphics that began to take over Pierce Brosnan's Bond (Golden Eye was great, but things deteriorated swiftly after that).<br /><br />Timeline wise, keep in mind that this is the 1st Bond venture as Casino Royale is Ian Fleming's first in the Bond series.  Therefore, I wonder if Craig will deliberately change the Bond persona as 007 progresses both personally and professionally?  I hope he does.  I am still getting used to Craig's style (or is it the Producers' style?) but I think he will be a good Bond.<br /><br />Eva Green makes one fine Bond Girl, if not... she's still fine regardless.  I remember seeing her in \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" and \\"The Dreamers\\" and remember saying \\"wow\\" everytime I saw her - She's here to stay as well.  Speaking of Bond Girls, I was racking my brain trying to figure out why \\"nudity\\" is listed in the rating factors? With much shock and some despair, I believe it's for Daniel Craig's torture scene - for crying out loud, I don't remember any female nudity!  And damn, I do miss the silhouetted babes during the opening credit. Oh well, this is the new Bond after all, and dinosaur like me better get used to it.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie and liked the new Bond (with reservation). However, just like M's line in the movie, \\"Christ, I miss the Cold War.\\"
0380789035|4.0|In this book Neil Gaiman explores a world in which the pre-Christian gods, not to mention all kinds of demi-gods, live in America. Most have been forgotten and live tawdry lives, eking out an existence on the margins of society. They encounter a new generation of gods of the internet and television, not to mention of cars and planes. A war between the old and the new is brewing and a man named Shadow is caught in the middle.<br /><br />What would it be like to be the son of a god in our own times? It is hard to relate to the experience of a mythical Greek hero like Hercules (a son of Zeus) because it seems as if he lived in a completely different, heroic world. Yet what would his experience have been if he lived in a world we can understand and relate to? Gaiman updates the concept for our times. He does so in a literarily consistent and fascinating fashion. This is a remarkable book without parallel in the genre. A must read.
0374105235|5.0|Ishmael Beah is currently an international expert on the influence of warfare on children, even though he is only twenty-six years old at the time of this book's publication.  However, his background is both all-too-common while also being extraordinarily unique.  \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is Beah's autobiography from age twelve (when Sierra Leone's civil war destroyed his village) to age seventeen (when he escaped Sierra Leone for America).<br /><br />The first 50% of the book chronicles Beah's attempts to escape from the violence of civil war.  By happenstance, Beah and his friends were in a neighboring village when rebel guerilla soldiers descended on his rural home village.  The village was destroyed, much of its population killed, and others (including Beah's family) scattered throughout the surrounding region.  Without a family, a home, or the basic necessities of life (food, money, etc.), Beah spends over a year as a displaced refugee, making his way from strange village to strange village and learning to survive on a day-to-day basis.  He narrowly escapes several rebel guerilla attacks, is run out of multiple villages (who believe he is a combatant spy), and witnesses a great deal of gruesome death.  Beah eventually finds that he is unable to escape the ever-present violence, hunger, and loneliness and thus joins the national army.<br /><br />The next 16 % of the book chronicles his two years as a soldier in the national army.  It is characterized by graphic scenes of horrific violence as Beah records his weapons training, his first battles (fighting along side and against other young teenagers), his near-constant drug-use, and an overall lack of sympathy amidst bloodshed.  He matter-of-factly writes of the death of his friends, the joy he felt slitting others' throats, and his anger when he was dissatisfied with his body-count.<br /><br />The final 33% of the book records his recovery and rehabilitation.  Suddenly discharged from the army and placed in the custody of UNICEF, Beah goes through a long, slow rehabilitation and therapy process.  This period is marked by sudden outbursts of violence, painful withdrawal symptoms as his drug use has ended, chilling flashbacks, and the narration of his most shocking acts of  violence.  Slowly, Beah begins to trust others and recovers so dramatically that the United Nations taps him to serve as a spokesperson for children affected by wars.<br /><br />The majesty of this book is not necessarily the events of Beah's life, but the manner in which these events are told.  His writing is simple without being simplistic.  He doesn't tell us what an event or person is like, he shows us in both subtle and powerful ways.  The end result is that \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is a book that this reader had a difficult time putting down.<br /><br />Two major motifs continually reoccur throughout this book:  inescapability and hope.  Even through Beah's efforts to avoid becoming involved in the civil war are heroic, the reader senses its constant presence--grinding Beah down, breathing down his neck, causing him fear, anger, loss, pain, being the stimulus for his every response.  The reader is aware that it is only a matter of time before the war envelops Beah--and yet he is still shocked when the inevitable happens.  A second, contrasting motif is hope.  Even though Beah lives through unimaginable pain, even though Beah commits unspeakable acts without a shred of remorse, he recovers.  More than that, Beah rises above his peers.  He embraces humanity and relationships, he abandons violence, he takes it upon himself to speak for the voiceless--other children trying to survive amidst war.<br /><br />While this book is disturbing, it is also encouraging.  It makes the reader aware of similar children in war zones--fighting, killing, dying, high, and violent.  Yet it also gives the reader the hope that it doesn't have to remain this way.  Highly recommended.es through a long, slow rehabilitation and therapy process.

B000M3452Y|4.0|James Murphy's 2005 debut as LCD Soundsystem received acclaim from virtually everyone who was willing to lend it an ear. It's flawless production and Murphy's unparalleled ability to craft smart dance music (which is no longer an oxymoron) was appealing to clubbers and hipsters alike. Still, Murphy is not without blemish, as his vocals often make him sound like he's battling a serious case of nasal congestion. This made it very hard for me, someone who really values a good vocalist, to really get into LCD Soundsystem's debut album. Even though I could see the brilliance of it, it wasn't as good as I felt it could have been. \\"Sound of Silver,\\" however, is the LCD Soundsystem I've always waited for. Though Murphy's vocals are still less than perfect, there's just no denying that this album is one that should be enjoyed for months and months.<br /><br />\\"Get Innocuous\\" immediately showcases Murphy's talents as a dance producer in ways that no other song of his has really done to date. Here, his vocals are at their absolute best, sounding like something straight out of the 80s. On the contrary, \\"Time to Get Away\\" features everything that I dislike about his voice. But this is dance music, so vocals are always going to take a backseat. It's not that they're totally unlistenable either, just not optimal. There are other times, however, when the vocals are completely excusable because the song itself is just so awesome.<br /><br />Take, for example, \\"North American Scum,\\" one of the best tracks on the album and one of the most fun songs of 2007 thus far. Murphy's tongue-in-cheek humor is unparalleled here, as he sings, \\"New York's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent, and it's the furthest you can live from the government. Some proud American Christians might disagree, here in north America. But New York's the only place we're keepin them off the street.\\" The song travels from a steady dance beat in the verses to an all-out rock guitar heavy chorus almost effortlessly. It truly is a fantastic song.<br /><br />\\"Someone Great\\" is a synth-heavy masterpiece that once again features Murphy's vocals at their best. In fact, they've never been better than when he's repeating \\"When someone great is gone!\\" towards the end of the song. Slowly but surely, he's forming me into a true LCD Soundsystem fan, and I'm loving every minute of it. The frantic piano line that begins \\"All My Friends\\" continues throughout it's length and eventually builds into an layer-heavy, semi-anthem that rivals The Killers or U2. It is completely unexpected, yet entirely welcomed!<br /><br />Truly, \\"Sound of Silver\\" is fantastic. It's an album that should be remembered as one of the best dance albums in recent memory and, in my opinion, LCD Soundsystem's best yet! Whether it's the cowbells of \\"Us v Them,\\" the earnestness of \\"New York I Love You, but You're Bringing Me Down,\\" the brilliant intricacy of \\"Sound of Silver,\\" or the undeniably fun sing along of \\"Watch the Tapes\\" (\\"Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes!\\"), every second of this album is enjoyable! Sure, I may be a little tough on Murphy's vocal abilities every now and then, but I'm honest enough to admit that \\"Sound of Silver\\" is an incredible album! Listen to it, soak it up, enjoy it, dance to it, and rest. Then do it all again! You won't regret it!<br /><br />Recommended for fans of LCD Soundsystem and anyone who want to hear what good, smart dance music sounds like.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br /><br />1. \\"Get Innocuous\\"<br /><br />2. \\"North American Scum\\"<br /><br />3. \\"Someone Great\\"<br /><br />4. \\"Watch the Tapes\\"<br /><br />5. \\"New York I Love You, but You're Bringing Me Down\\"<br /><br />8 out of 10 Starsfortlessly.

B000068FWC|5.0|This is one of those rarities, a megahit album that really deserved to be. Supertramp had been writing great songs for years, but this is the only one where they were able to put their sophisticated and cynical songs into a pop form which would click with the average listener. While their earlier albums were more intellectual, this one is more emotional, while packed with pop hooks and maintaining a high quality of songwriting. Actually, it was their best album in several years, almost as good as \\"Crime of the Century\\". The only thing it suffers from is that there were so many hits that were overplayed so badly on the radio. Some of the lesser-known tracks are also outstanding, particularly \\"Gone Hollywood\\", which contains one of the best expressions of depression I've ever heard in a song (\\"ain't nothing new in my life today\\"), and \\"Child of Vision\\", the most prog-ish track here. Supertramp were definitely an acquired taste, but this album was a lot easier to absorb than their others, and there's really not a single dog out of all the tracks here.

Although the movie was meant to be a horror flick I personally don't like it when evil rules and the devil wins in the end. Other than that the constant negativity was occasionally well glossed over with some fine nudity. I will be giving my copy away. I probably should burn it!

B000001ESJ|4.0|With \\"A Farewell to Kings\\", Rush achieved a new level of maturity in their songwriting, arrangements, and recording that they lacked on their previous albums.  Every song on this album is very good, with \\"Xanadu\\" and \\"Closer to the Heart\\" being the best of the group.  Most bands can't follow up a classic album this well, and Rush deserves a lot of credit for putting out a strong record like \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" after \\"2112\\".  If I had to find one negative about this album, it would be that it doesn't have the same raw intensity of \\"2112\\".  Every Rush fan will already own this, but still a strong recommendation to non-hardcore fans that want to own a few Rush albums.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|Before \\"Harvest\\" was released in 1972, I had a bootleg of a Neil Young performance at LA's Dorothy Chandler Pavillion, from the same 1971 tour that brings us this record.  It had some of best songs from \\"Harvest,\\" in versions that made the subsequent \\"Harvest\\" recording a little disappointing, good as it was.  \\"Old Man\\" sung solo is a tour de force.  \\"Old Man\\" with pedal steel guitar, Linda Ronstadt doing backup, and a little banjo plinking out some of the knotty guitar work is...really good, no doubt about it, but somewhat watered down.  \\"A Man Needs a Maid\\" was plenty spooky on the bootleg; there was no need for the thunderous orchestra crashing down around him.  The bootleg also had some songs that appeared on later albums, like \\"Journey Through the Past,\\" and \\"See the Sky About to Rain,\\" which came out on \\"Time Fades Away\\" and \\"On the Beach\\" respectively.<br /><br />In every case where a song was debuted on this tour and later recorded in the studio, the live versions were better.  \\"Live at Massey Hall\\" has all the songs I remember from the bootleg, plus several others that didn't make it, but the sound quality here is exquisitely clear and resonant.<br /><br />Two things are made abundantly clear on this record:<br /><br />a) 1971 was the very pinnacle of his songwriting.  The music he made then was complex yet organic, and combined with the words, extremely dramatic.<br /><br />b) Neil Young was, and is, a prodigious musician.  Sometimes he likes to hide his craft, but here it is on full display.  Those incredible guitar lines -- it's hard to believe he's accompanying himself while he sings all this new material perfectly in key, without messing up a word. This guy was no shambling hippy, much as he wanted us to think he was.  He was a highly disciplined musician.<br /><br />This recording is, in a way, the height of the \\"coffee house\\" sound, taken to its furthest edges of technical and artistic brilliance.  Bob Dylan has never sounded this good live or solo.  James Taylor has equivalent chops, but his songwriting doesn't come close.  The only possible comparison is Joni Mitchell.<br /><br />The first Archive release from Neil, the 1969 Crazy Horse show at Fillmore West is a good souvenir for fans of the band-that-almost-was, but after you've heard it a few times, you want to go back to the original recordings he made for \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere.\\"  But this CD should reach far beyond Neil's normal fan base.  It gives what should be the definitive versions of some of his most popular songs. It is simply the best album of the year so far, and will be hard to beat.good live or solo.

B000CCD0HQ|5.0|If you want one ZZ Top album to capture their spirit, it's not Eliminator, it's Tres Hombres.  La Grange captures their classic Texas shuffle in a song that's become a movie soundtrack staple.  Waitin' for the Bus and Jesus Just Left Chicago are outstanding songs in their own right - the slide from one to the other is one of the smoothese medley transitions in rock.  2 great old school blues tunes fused together.  Beer Drinkers & Hell Raisers captures the rowdy side of the band, while Hot, Blue and Righteous shows their love of the classic auto.  Truly a definitive work of ZZ Top.
B000F5GO0A|4.0|While it is a great CD I would also recommend Boris Kovac's Last Balkan Tango for more of the lovely Eastern/Southern European melancholia. I am amazed how Beirut manages at moments to outplay Kovac, a music veteran with twenty years of experience in New/\\"World\\" music. That right there is a great achievment for a 19-year old kid. Oh, yes, if you can grab somewhere UNMIK Titanic, a latest documentary by Boris Mitic which opens with a mournful, but yet comedic gypsy brass cover of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" you will be closer to understanding what the H-E-C-K the Balkans is all about.

Once we figured out that the songs that we loved were only available on the version with the bonus track we purchased that one.  We felt cheated that the original cd was short songs, but on the bright side we now have one CD in each car.  It is only an issue as to who is going to get the version with the bonus tracks.

B000MNP2KI|3.0|Like many reviewers, I bought the DVD based on the good reviews that I have read here at Amazon.  Having viewed the movie, I can not honestly say I am very excited, my question is whether the Bond movie can go on, or how long it can go on in this format.    Daniel Craig did put in a very good and different effort.  The action sequences are good, though Bond did seem to have gotten hurt too easily and perhaps a bit carelessly for a spy.  Eva Green is very beautiful, and has probably the best acting, along with Michelle Yeoh, of all the Bond female leads.  Overall, however, I can not tell much difference between this movie and any other action movies.  Actually, with the long drawn-out story and frequently drifting storyline, in my opinion it is much less than many of the better action movies.    While some of the former Bond movies did look silly such as 'Die Another Day', 'Moonraker' and 'A View To A Kill'; overall Bond movies did create an anticipation for fans.  If future Bond movies follows the pattern of 'Casino Royale', I can't help but thinking how long the Bond movies days will still have.    I first watched 'Dr. No' at the age of 18, and have seen all Bond movies since; own all the DVDs and many in the Ultimate Edition format. I certainly hope that the Bond movies do not disappear too soon.  Well, we will have to wait and see.     The audio and video qualities are good, though it does carry a yellow cast when played on either of my two DVD players.  I ended up changing the color tempeture on my Sony RPTV to 'Cool' to make the movie look more pleasant; it could be the Sony, although I have not had this kind of problem with the vast majority of DVDs before.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman has had his ups and downs in cinema, beginning with a 1940's serial to a campy 1960's series.  Batman got a remake from Tim Burton in 1989, but the remake deteriorated over the course of three sequels.  Director and writer Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer have re-envisioned Batman along the lines of The Dark Knight, reinvigorating a franchise headed in the wrong direction.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, \\"Reign of Fire\\" and \\"The Prestige\\") had a nasty experience as a child involving bats; lots of bats.  We soon learn that young Wayne may be a bit of a wimp, partially because of the bat experience, but perhaps also because he blames himself for getting his parents killed.  Eventually young Wayne turns his guilt to a source of strength for revenge, and focuses his life on revenging his parents, and then anyone who is defenseless.<br /><br />Bruce heads abroad to study with a society that has mysterious purposes.  Bruce believes that this society could channel his need for revenge into useful directions, until Bruce finds out that the society will control him more than he controls the society, and Bruce and the society part ways.<br /><br />The transition from Bruce Wayne the guilt-ridden young man to vengeful Batman is the goal of this movie, and Director Nolan keeps that focus from beginning to end.  The transition starts out slowly as Bruce becomes a young man, but speeds up as Bruce begins to focus his life into a purpose.  The final quarter of the movie is spectacular and not only provides a worthy end to this movie, but makes a great beginning to the next film \\"The Dark Knight.\\"<br /><br />Several factors that help make this movie a joy to watch for fans of the Batman.<br /><br />First, the technology is somewhat accessible and logical.  There are technologies that are rooted in science fiction, but much of what we see in the movie either exists or could exist.<br /><br />Second, the special effects are phenomenal.  I knew when the movie relied on digital effects, but the detail was so exquisite that I was unable to tell when real life ended and digital began.  Incidentally, residents of Chicago will likely recognize many of the locations used for this film.  Though Chicago is a bright and open city, several lower level areas in Chicago provided excellent background shots for Gotham City.<br /><br />Third, the villains in this film were non-costumed and generally \\"normal\\" as compared to the Penguin, the Riddler, and others of that ilk.  This movie contains hints regarding future villains, but we must await the next movie to see how Nolan evolves them.<br /><br />Last, the actors in this film are excellent choices for their roles.  I always worry about the selection of an actor for a character like Batman.  Christian Bale is excellent and believable as the Dark Knight.  Michael Caine is the imperturbable butler Alfred (Michael Caine and Christian Bale made another memorable appearance together the year after this film in \\"The Prestige\\").  Liam Neeson has a lock on the role of mentor.  Many other great actors helped make this movie seem very real, including Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, and Katie Holmes.<br /><br />Batman may have had his ups and downs in more than six decades of cinema, but he has never looked better than he does in \\"Batman Begins.\\"  This movie sets a standard for future Batman movies and for super heroes transitioning from illustrated soft covers to live action.  I hope the films that follow will get the hint.<br /><br />Enjoy!en the movie relied on digital effects, but the detail was so exquisite that I was unable to tell when real life ended and digital began.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I begged a couple of guys across the hall in my apartment complex to let me watch this mammoth production with them this evening (since I don't get the Discovery Channel on my Limited Basic Cable package).  The two men were agreeable, provided neither college nor professional basketball was on during the 8pm to 11pm time slot.  They ended up loving it as much as I did, and all three of us marvelled at the wonder of nature.<br /><br />They were far more enthusiastic about the brutal, action-packed hunting scenes than I was, but they tolerated my squealing about how cute the baby animals were (the red panda in particular). All of us had a good laugh over the male Bird of Paradise and his failed attempt to attract a mate---this puts a new spin on the phrase \\"trying too hard.\\"<br /><br />The ocean life was awesome--but if you've seen The Blue Planet, you'll already be familiar with most of the material covered. We were all disappointed that the creepy-looking Angler fish was not featured--this creature is long overdue for some serious orthodontics--talk about an overbite, or is that an underbite?--It can't even close its own mouth! After the ocean episode, we see from \\"behind-the-scenes\\" where one of the camera men was all but provoking a hungry shark in order to get a close-up, wearing no more protection than his wet suit and diving gear.<br /><br />What a project, and what a great dividend we \\"shareholders\\" in Planet Earth get to behold!  New high-speed camera technology allowed never-before footage of otherwise reclusive and elusive animals (and this nature documentary borrowed tricks from Hollywood to get the best shots, including low-hanging helicopters that kept up with the chase).  If this project doesn't get the ball rolling for some serious conservancy, I don't know what will.<br /><br />I enjoyed Sigorney Weaver's well-articulated narration and pleasant-sounding voice, but I think she could have put more emotion into narrating the more intense scenes of Planet Earth, especially considering what a fine actress she is.<br /><br />Next Sunday can't come too soon!dering what a fine actress she is.      Next Sunday can't come too soon!
1582701709|5.0|It's an easy read.  It's worth checking out-if just for the inspiration.
630529142X|4.0|I went to see this film in a theater when it was released and thought it was OK, but after watching it on DVD a few times over the years it has really grown on me. Henry Winkler, Jimmy Reed and Kathy Bates are hystrical in this lovable and funny movie. A classic sports comedy that blows away his lame remake of the Longest Yard!
0374105235|4.0|Call him Ishmael: average Sierra Leonean boy of twelve; rap music aficionado; refugee; orphan; teen; drug-addicted, murdering, remorseless soldier; migraine sufferer; rehabilitatee; New Yorker; adoptee; writer; rich man. First \\"touched by war\\" at age twelve, a trek with a group of boys (including his elder brother) is cut short when they learn that rebels have attacked their village. They continue on in search of a safer location, but during an attack, Beah becomes separated from his brother. Shortly before they arrive at a village where his family has been spotted, it is attacked before he can reunite with them or determine their fate. These excursions, several brushes with death (some thwarted due to his interest in rap music), acts of both random kindness and cruelty by those they encounter and three months spent working and living in a farming community make up the first half of the book. Midway through, Beah is living amongst fellow refugees under the protection of soldiers and he and the other males are given two choices: kill, that is, become a soldier; or be killed, attempt to travel to a safer area while unprotected and unarmed. Most choose the former. The memoirs of Beah as a boy soldier make up about ten percent of the book, half mid-book and half interspersed in the latter part. The new recruits are given name-brand sneakers, AK47s, drugs, and hands-on training. Soon he and his fellow soldiers, under the influence of a variety of plentiful, powerful drugs, are ravaging villages and murdering villagers. Of their first mission, he writes, \\"I killed a man,\\" soon thereafter, \\"I shot as many as I could.\\" Involved in speed-killing competition, \\"I didn't feel a thing for him...I grabbed the man's head and slit his throat.\\" After forcing prisoners to dig their own graves and burying them alive, they...laugh. Of his two-years-plus long spree of murder and mayhem, he writes, \\"Killing had become a daily activity,\\" and \\"I felt no pity for anyone.\\" Inexplicably, he, along with 14 other young soldiers, is given up to UNICEF workers to be rehabilitated. In a telling scene hours after arriving at the rehabilitation facility, boys who had fought on opposing sides of the conflict are placed together: the subsequent brawl results in six deaths. During his rehabilitation, variations of the statement, \\"None of what happened was your fault,\\" is told to him repeatedly and is eventually accepted as truth. The last part of the book covers his experiences during and after rehab and his escape from Sierra Leone. While the plight of child soldiers is unarguably deserving of sympathy; the nameless, faceless many whose lives were cut short by the actions of these boys, teens, and young men are noticeably absent. Of (his and) his squad's actions, Beah writes, \\"...the entire squad would attack the village...killing everyone so that we would stay alive.\\" Nothing is said of the fate of the soldiers' victims or their families. This brief but important story varies from average to excellent in quality of writing, usually falling somewhere in between.along with 14 other young soldiers, is given up to UNICEF workers to be rehabilitated.

B00003CXD0|5.0|Tootsie is one of theose rare comedies that could have been slapstick about a man in drag, but turns out to be a genius comedy. Insiteful and heartfelt as much as hilarious, Tootsie delivers on so many levels, the best comedies do. Hoffman is so convincing in the title role, that you forget sometimes he isn't actual a woman. I think they gave him an Oscar for his role in \\"Rain Man\\" because he was robbed for his role in this film! although his role in 'Rainman' is another outstanding performance, it's nowhere near as complex as Tootsie.<br /><br />The entire cast does an excellent job, especially Murray as Hoffman's room mate and the overlooked Charles Durning in an underappreciated role. Don't miss this one...it will zap you in the pah-doo-bees! My review is for the first release, but there is a new deluxe 25th anniversay DVD release with commentary and some interesting extras.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|When I first heard of bfc I don't think I even wanted to see it. Then I saw Ferris Bueller's Day Off and one thing led to another. Anyways the point is, this movie is actually fun to watch. All five of these characters are surprisingly believable and not to mention funny. Though this movie is usually considered a \\"chick flick\\" I have no problem watching it. Otherwise, besides certian immoral content in the film, that i try to skip anyways, this movie is great! I'm amused by the scenario the characters are put in. I can actually relate to Brian(the nerd). Its kind of scary though, cause he shares my name. As for the rest characters, they just made me laugh to no end. The basket case I found particularly cool. I won't comment on the emotional aspect of the film, but I will say I felt it and just leave it at that. Oh and as a 17 year old, trust me, its great to see teens actually act like teens!!!!! Now a days it seems most teen flicks are bassically movies about sex crazed monsters(no ones REALLY like that). AND IT'S NOT FUNNY, its just kind of grose.  So in conclusion, this movie was actually to my surprise good.The BEST PART is when there all dancing to We Are Not Alone by Karla Devito.  I never thought in a million years I would like a movie where some jock started crying about how he tapped some kid's bun cheeks together.         P.S. No seriously though, what was up with that bun cheek thing?
B000A0GP0Y|1.0|First off, I am an big Adam Sandler fan,but this movie is really lame. The original Film is a classic. How do you screw this up? When I first heard about this film I was ready for something funny like \\"The Water Boy\\" that movie was hilarious and I think Sandler should have taken a good look at it again before doing this one. This film is not even worth a look.
B000002WPI|5.0|Yes, this one is one of the greatest hip hop albums to have come out.  Don't really need to say anymore than that.
B00000G3PA|3.0|I know there are a lot of people who hate this film, but no matter how stupid it may be, it's a very entertaining movie. If you are a movie lover who wants everything to be completely believable and realistic then this is not the movie for you. If you are on the other hand the type of movie lover who likes an incredible and fun thrill ride then should make film will make your day.<br /><br />It's an action movie in every sense of the word with liable characters and many over the top and unrealistic moments. This is a popcorn munchin' thrill/laugh and even get a lump in your throat at the end kinda movie! Well worth watching silly or not!....it's just a movie...right? so take your brain out and enjoy this film for what it is.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Excellent movie, the kids love it and so did we.  Hayao Miyazaki is a master. All of his movies have been very good and we will continue to look for more of them.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|I must admit I wanted to hate this film after they robbed Hoffman of an Oscar for his role in 'Tootsie'. I think it was harder for Hoffman to pull off playing a woman than an autistic savant, but this is a great film and another incredible performance by Hoffman. Tom Cruise in an early dramtic role stands toe to toe with Hoffman and does an excellent job as his self-centered brother.<br /><br />What could have been nothing more than a standard buddy flick turns out to be one of the most touching and powerful films ever made. It grows on you more with each viewing and has become one of my favorite films of all time. Lightning in a bottle here, it doesn't come around too often, so this is a film that should not be missed! The special edition DVD release has a very good transfer, 3 commentaries, deleted scenes and an original feature-ette.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I loved this movie because it put the whole Beauty Queen in perspective. <br />Children should be children not sex objects.  I laughed and laughed.
B000NA28I4|3.0|ERAGON is not without its flaws - a weak and corny script, shoddy editing, Swiss cheese story line - but it is also not without some charm.  Unfortunately it is in competition with the Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings, etc etc that seem to flow endlessly out of Hollywood and the foreign markets.<br /><br />The story of a young lad finding a 'jewel' that turns out to be the egg from which a dragon hatches, offering the chance  to reestablish dragon flying and the defeat of an evil world works well enough.  And the actors who agreed to take on the various roles (Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, John Malkovich, Djimon Hounsou, and Rachel Weisz) complement the newcomers Edward Speleers, Sienna Guillory, Garrett Hedlund and Christopher Egan. But the joy is the hatching of the little dragon that is a masterful piece of animation and from her birth she steals the show. This is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it does have enough ingredients to play with the imagination.  Grady Harp, March 07
B00005JN0T|1.0|If you're from a certain part of Asia you'll understand the title of this review.<br /><br />This might have been a great movie, but it's impossible to get past Smith's gawkiness and &#34;attitude&#34;, lending a clownish cast to his character. The whole tone of the movie is colored by his misguided acting. All seriousness is lost in his silly quips and awkward costuming. &#34;Somehow 'I told you so' doesn't quite say it.&#34; Horrible scripting in many instances. &#34;This thing doesn't run on gas, does it? Gas explodes, you know!&#34; Yuck. Thanks for ruining it, Big Bird.<br /><br />And the CGI is not too impressive either. The sight of swarms of robots jumping around like grasshoppers doesn't exactly inspire awe; looks more like a bad scene from a videogame. Although I liked the concept of cables for muscles.<br /><br />But how about the story? As I mentioned, it's totally dominated by Smith's &#34;Bad Boys&#34; persona and his ridiculous costumes which accentuate his ears (and earrings). His strutting and brooding and constant throwing around of his weight crowd out any serious consideration of the plot. It's jarring. It's a complete mismatch for this type of movie. They might as well have cast Jon Lovitz in the part.<br /><br />The movie is further ruined by some silly &#34;big air&#34; gunfighting from Smith, again completely out of place in this movie.<br /><br />And why does he hate robots so much? You'll laugh until you cry when you find out. And then you'll want to slap him silly.<br /><br />Oh. And another thing. It's implausible that we would manufacture robots of such strength and, well, hardness without some easy way to disable them, just in case. It's just too scary for us otherwise - that's human nature. No one wants to be in a building at night with an automaton that can pull your head off if its software or hardware fails - talk about Blue Screen of Death.<br /><br />Finally, there is no conflict regarding the three laws in the movie, so don't expect any philosophical musings in that regard. The issue is cheaply circumvented.cumvented.
B00005JPLU|2.0|I'm a fan of graphic novel adaptations as much as the next person, but \\"300\\" was a really bad movie.<br /><br />Yes, the effects were nice and its interesting to see what digital wizardry and a blue-screen can do.<br /><br />However, there is simply no story (even if this story is true, its pretty boring, and very dubious), and to top it all, everyone is acting ferocious and enthusiastic about war, and its not really very convincing.<br /><br />The Spartans even have a ridiculous battle cry that sounds like wounded wolves. This is not a good thing.<br /><br />This was more of a comedy - I almost fell off my chair when they brought the 8 foot tall Persian King Xerxes in. He played the role so over the top and so flamboyant, I was giggling throughout.<br /><br />And what was up with the boring angle of the Kings' wife sleeping around and then killing her traitor. A useless sub-plot to be sure.<br /><br />Some of the digital animals used were fun to watch - such as the gigantic rhino and the useless elephants (they all trip over a cliff and fall - Im being serious).<br /><br />Then there is the question of the insanely ripped abs on all the Spartans (who I'm guessing were all gay anyway - does history prove me wrong?) - and they all seem to be incredibly into each other - a little too much.<br /><br />The only one into the war seems to be the King, and he dies this really poorly filmed death, so whats the point.<br /><br />This was a two hour \\"Braveheart\\" rip-off, and they don't even win the war!<br /><br />Jokes aside, this was pretty terrible, with some nonsensical violence, and oh, of course, a Middle-Eastern sounding background score so that Western audiences can go \\"Oooh, how authentic\\". Please.<br /><br />This was nonsense. Its amazing that such shoddy garbage is being revered as 'art'. Fanboys need some new material, or they need to actually travel the world and get out more to appreciate true art.<br /><br />Two stars. And methinks thats two stars too many.two stars too many.
B000MNOX7Q|5.0|My son brought this film home from the local rental place and, though having never heard of it, I decided to watch it on the strength of the cast, which is stellar. I must say that it is a highly entertaining, atmospheric, and intriguing thriller that focuses on ten people, ostensible strangers to each other, who, through a seeming twist of fate, meet one dark and stormy night at a seedy motel in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />There, a strange fate begins to over take them, as one by one they meet up with a mysterious killer. No one knows who amongst them is the killer. No one knows who is next. Yet, there is apparently a link that binds them all. There is also a parallel story involving a convicted killer that opens the film and continues to be interjected at odd moments throughout the film. It is a story that is also interesting and becomes more so as the film continues.<br /><br />There are subtle clues along the way that point the viewer in the right direction, in terms of what is really going on. The viewer, however, will generally realize this in hindsight, which is, of course, always twenty/twenty. The pace of the film is relentless. The tension is palpable. The acting is top notch. The direction is first rate, and the ending screams out, \\"Gotcha!\\".<br /><br />This is a surprisingly effective psychological thriller that all those who love films of this genre should enjoy. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep even the most jaded viewers on their toes. While the performances of the entire cast are uniformly excellent, special kudos go to John Cusack for a truly powerful, memorable performance. Bravo!

This book is about fourteen year old Perseus Jackson who finds out he's the son of Poseidon, the sea god.  He fights tons of monsters including the Minator, Medusa and a hell hound. <br /> <br />I though it was funny when he said \\"On the fall of that building, I wasn't scared, but my only thought I had was: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!\\" <br /> <br />I recommend this book to people who like ancient Greece and that's why you should read the Lightning Thief. <br />
B000NQPZCO|5.0|This griity and grim mob flick, deftly directed by Mike Newell, is based upon the true story of FBI undercover, Joe Pistone, who. as his alter ego \\"Donnie Brasco\\", infiltrated the mob for a number of years, resulting in its eventual decimation. So artfully did the real Joe Pistone infiltrate and so well did he do his job, that he and his family were obliged to enter the witness protection program for their safety, as a contract was ultimately put out on Joe Pistone's life.<br /><br />Here, Johnny Depp, plays the role of Joe Pistone/Donnie Brasco. He is terrific in the role, and the viewer watches him become absorbed by the lifestyle of the mobsters with whom he associates. He is befriended by \\"Lefty\\" Ruggierro, artfully played Al Pacino. Shifty and<br /><br />common, \\"Lefty\\" typifies your low level made guy, the guy on the fringes doing the dirty work, a real bottom feeder. He is the guy who does the hits, and he is the guy the higher ups look to whack when something goes wrong. It is not an enviable or glamourous life, as has been made out by other films, such as the \\"Godfather\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\". The existence of \\"Lefty\\" and the legions like him is gritty and grim, always a bridesmaid and never a bride.<br /><br />\\"Lefty\\" takes Brasco under his wing and vouches for him. He shows Brasco the ABCs of becoming a \\"made\\" guy. \\"Lefty\\" himself wants to move up in the mob hierarchy. It soon becomes painfully obvious that that ain't gonna happen. One cannot help feel a little sorry for \\"Lefty\\", so limited is his world view and so at the mercy of others. Still, \\"Lefty\\" gives Donnie some invaluable lessons on mob etiquette. He also unburdens himself to Donnie, treating him as if he were his adopted son. The bond between the two men grows. As this happens, Donnie finds himself being pulled more and more into the world of mobsters, until his old and new reality begin to merge.<br /><br />As he distances himself drom his wife (Anne Heche) and family, Brasco is thrust into a maelstrom of mob violence that threatens to tear him apart and consume him. He tries to get \\"Lefty\\" to go straight and retire, in hope of avoiding his betrayal. It is to no avail. Brasco, in for a penny, in for a pound, now stands to become a \\"made\\" guy himself. It is only at the eleventh hour that an intervention set up by the FBI plays itself out, setting up the betrayal of \\"Lefty\\". It is a sad moment for Brasco, as he knows that \\"Lefty\\" has just been handed a death sentence at the hands of the mob for vouching for an FBI agent. It is Brasco's ultimate salvation, however, as he was on the brink of committing an unpardonable act, one in which he would have crossed the line and from which there would have been no turning back. It is a decision that was, luckily for him, taken out of his hands.<br /><br />Al Pacino gives the defining, superlative performance in this film. Anne Heche is sensational as the put upon, concerned wife, who watches her husband change into someone she can barely recognize. Johnny Depp, likewise, gives a stellar performance as the angst ridden FBI undercover agent. All in all, a terrific film with a stellar cast and well worth having in one's collection.trom of mob violence that threatens to tear him apart and consume him.

0060723513|3.0|There is much controversy about this book regarding its status as truth or fiction, but it deserves 3 stars, possibly more, for its concept of a community as it should be in many ways. The members exist peacefully with one another and the land, live very simply without the need for ownership and with a deep awareness of their connection to all things. Despite its 'new age' overtones and tendency to go overboard in some areas, there is much food for thought.

B00005JPLU|3.0|...but that's about it.<br /><br />To my undaunted recollection, there were three scenes in this film that lived upto what the trailer promised. I'd give the trailer a genuine five stars, really. If I had not seen Sin City, I would have disliked this film. The acting in 300 was a mixed bag. King L's dialogue delivery, though intentional, looked and sounded stupid on more than two occasions. Of course,I understand that his character was of unparallel power and might BUT there was so much spit involved... In any case, 300 has a videogame demo like way of going about things. There is a lot of colour in this film which I like. It has the most interesting of starts and I liked it more when I went back home and spoke of it with people.<br /><br />One of the major reasons this film will never be recalled as a groundbreaker in terms of story and script would be because it lacked that substance. It lacked that ingenuity in character, it lacked a character that could be called a favourite, it was over-edited to please the audience I felt, it was a bit too fast yet a bit too slow, there was no intestinal grasping fortitude and the end was a bit wayward and shallow in how happy it seemed.<br /><br />The queen's character both saved and ruined this film. The gollum was left incomplete. I loved the sets. The background score was OK. Overall, fans of Sin City will like it 71% as much as they liked that. Sin City had the character of Roark and Elijah Wood that I just cannot forget about. If I was to speak with the Director and point out ONE FLAW in this film then it would have to be over animated intensity of every Spartan. I mean, I'm having my Popcorn in the audience and I'm wondering where is his real animosity coming from. There were not enough scenes to build up an anger. The film seems to launch the audience into an oblivious territory. We don't mind but we review, ok?<br /><br />Overall, 300 has a silly font in it's title and could have been so much better.  I loved the Rugby like battle formations. I still haven't figured out why so much of doozy attention was allotted to the children in the movie. (I mean, give me a break) \\"Lord of the Ring\\" fans will sit back and smile at each other after watching 300. However, I promised not to hate it because I loved some scenes. Is it a must watch? Heck of course. Does it deserve an Oscar?<br /><br />*Reviewer walks away to get a Diet Pepsi*<br /><br />Let's watch ZODIAC next!the Rugby like battle formations.

If you enjoy Led Zeppelin, then you will enjoy these DVD's.
B000JBWWRY|3.0|Like all Disney's Classics -and I mean the real classics, not those new movies they call classics- Peter Pan has a lot of what has been called the magic of Disney. Of course there are some themes that are very questionable and politically incorrect in these days, like the way indians are depicted and Peter's Pan cruel joke of cutting Hook's hand and feeding it to a crocodile. In spite of these, \\"Peter Pan\\" is an excellent adventure movie for children and also, even as a child, I could appreciate the sexual appeal of the sirens and, of course, of Tinkerbell. It's nice they're finally making a movie about Tinkerbell, I just hope they do it right. <br />The big disappointment to me was that this was not a widescreen version of the movie, that was a big let-down. They're announcing the coming realese of \\"The Jungle Book\\", so I hope they make it widescreen. <br />

1582701709|1.0|Yes, our thoughts influence the world, but not the way it's described here. Actually, it works more like this: <br />1. Your thoughts and feelings influence each other <br />2. Your thoughts and feelings influence your behavior <br />3. Your behavior affects something <br />4. This affects something else <br />5. This in turn affects something else <br />(...omit a few steps here...) <br />n. This in turn affects the thing you were thinking about. <br />Even this is oversimplified, because everything has multiple effects on multiple things. For more details, read a book on cognitive therapy such as \\"Feeling Good\\" by Burns.[[ASIN:0380810336 Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy Revised and Updated]] <br />The other aspect is that your perceptions and attitude will affect how you view things. See any psychology textbook for more about this.  <br />So the simple formula \\"Your thought ---> the object of your thought\\" is just a gross over-simplification.Your thoughts make a difference, but not directly.

0805066691|5.0|When this book was first published it was the first history of the American west from the Indian point of view and it makes this read revolutionary.  It examines all the conflicts of the west from the point of view of the native leaders, forced to struggle against increased white settlement and their people's needs.  This book glorifies the native warriors who sought peace, such as Black Kettle, and those who chose to fight, such as Geronimo.  It is a sweeping, beautiful history and tells the stories of great men such as CHief Joseph and tribes previously ignored such as the Klamath.  A very interesting book, great reading.  It is however not exactly historical, it is a sweeping portrait of the fight between the tribes and the U.S government, it is not a supra-detailed analysis of every tribe or leader.<br /><br />One nice thing about this book is that it is not overtly political and does not get bogged down in jargon, it is a read, not a quest to look down on the reader.  It is a cry to give the native leaders justice and honor.
0307237699|5.0|\\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is a finely crafted and surprisingly intimate look into the quick mind and evolving soul of a very rare being in the American political landscape -- Obama is simply both enlightened and enlightening. For this, I consider his book an absolute MUST READ for anyone who considers themselves to be political, nevermind party affiliation.<br /><br />But far more than that, for those 40% of Americans who do not vote or who do not participate in the outrageous political activism of the day, this is the best entry level overview with which to jumpstart your thinking. You will find that Obama carries a kind of authentic and inclusive passion that is very contagious. Like all things worthwhile, it leaves you hungering for more.<br /><br />At the risk of really dating myself, I should like to set this amazing tome on my bookcase right next to [[ASIN:0393318672 The Ugly American]] and watch what happens, ha ha -- except I have a ridiculously long line of friends waiting to borrow it. And if you're one of my friends, you best go buy your own copy right now ;-)
B00005JKNF|5.0|I first watched Gosford Park when it came out several years ago.  Last night, I decided to give it a second viewing.  This movie is really excellent.  The acting is top-notch.  Being that it is Hellen Mirren time after the last academy awards, I was able to really focus in on her performance which is excellent in Gosford Park.  The movie is somewhat difficult due to Altman's use of multiple characters talking at the same time.  His technique; however, is pretty close to everyday life, so it is just a matter of focusing in.  Great storyline, with the \\"help\\" suffering the same gossip, and jealousy issues the upper class endure.<br /><br />Highly recommended 5 star film.

0743243315|1.0|Nothing in Nazneen's life has ever been under her control.  Even her birth itself was left to fate: she seemed to be stillborn but then she finally took her first breath and fate allowed her to live.  This story was told to her throughout her childhood in Bangladesh, and she learned that it was futile to fight against fate.  When her father announces that she, at eighteen, is to go to London to marry a forty-year-old man named Chanu, Nazneen doesn't argue. <br /> <br />London is lonely.  Nazneen doesn't speak English, is discouraged from making many friends and can't really relate to her husband, a selfish and pompous man who seems to think himself overly kind because he doesn't beat his wife.  She tries being passive and going along with her life.  Then she tries rebelling in small ways but is frustrated when Chanu doesn't seem to notice she's neglected her housekeeping duties.  It is only when Nazneen and Chanu's baby boy is in the hospital that Nazneen begins to appreciate her husband's good qualities and she also experiences some moments of pure happiness. <br /> <br />Throughout the next twenty years or so, though, Nazneen is unable to hold onto that happiness.  It is only when she finds out that her husband finally has taken steps to put into action one of his long-discussed plans that she is spurred to action. <br /> <br />This book, for me, was one long and depressing chore to read.  Nazneen allowed herself to be a slave to her fate, but the entire book was a detailed list of all of the ways in which her life was completely unbearable.  I found it agonizing to read about someone who was so thoroughly unhappy all of the time, and it made me anxious to read about the ways in which Chanu continued to mess up the lives of Nazneen and their children.  The book had an uplifting ending, but it was so abrupt that it seemed unrealistic and jarring, instead of the relief it should have been.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I'm a johnny-come-lately to this charming film with the talented Felicity Huffman.  I've been meaning to see this movie since it was first released but always managed to miss it.  Finally, I gave it a go and I'm pleased with the result.<br /><br />Huffman playes Bree (once Stanley) a pre-opt transexual who is eagerly looking forward to the upcoming operation that will finally give her the body she has always longed for.  With everything set, an unforeseen problem pops up-------a son she never knew she had.  Bree's therapist forces Bree to confront this problem before getting the life altering surgery she will receive in a week.<br /><br />Leaving her home in Los Angeles and arriving in New York, Bree makes bail for her seventeen year old son (arrested for prostitution and drugs) and agrees to take him across country to California.  It is during this cross country trip that Bree develops a relationship with her son, all the while keeping their biological connection a secret.  The two eventually end up at her parents home, where the painful secret comes to light.<br /><br />Felicity Huffman (best known for her role as Lynette on television's \\"Desperate Housewives\\") gives a performance that definitely deserved the accolades she received for it.  Peter Zegers is also really good as Bree's teenage son, who has managed to survive by hustling and uses drugs to numb the pain of his actions.<br /><br />If you are turned off by the idea of a transexual, don't be.  This film is really about the relationships between Bree and her son and her family.  Give this movie a try...you won't be disappointed.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|The exotic shooting locales in this movie are impressive. But trying to tell 3 small stories within one movie crippled the movie in terms of detail. What is the message? Essentially there are 3 sets of people with their own problems (self created issues) and the movie jumps quickly between these 3 stories. There are some great visuals but with a zero storyline there is nothing genius about this movie although some people claim that to be the case.    A good movie should make people think and take something back from the time spent watching it. Babel's failure to do so makes this an average film. I think the movie could have made a great travel documentary.    Brad Pitt is average, Cate spends most of the time sick/FUBAR after being shot, lots of more unremarkable performances from other actors round off the acting contribution.
B00005JPLU|4.0|After seeing the trailer for this film, I couldn't wait to experience it on screen.  While the director and writers took liberties with history, they did so to give the audience an entertaining popcorn movie with an amazing and visually pleasing look that sets the mood for the entire movie.<br /><br />The story is centered around the Spartan King played by Gerard Butler, probably best known for his role in \\"Phantom of the Opera\\".  Butler is charasmatic as King Leonidas, who takes three hundred of his best warriors to stop an advance of the Persian empire into the Greek lands.  With a brilliant plan to halt the overwhelming numbers he faces, the king takes his men to a pass that will allow the men to fight the invaders on a more level playing field.<br /><br />Back in Sparta, Leonidas' Queen is trying to get the council to agree to send military aid to her husband and his band of brave soldiers.  While the Queen tries to muster help for the 300, the villianous leader of the Persians, Xerxes, sends wave after wave of men, unsuccessfully, to fight the Spartans who would rather die than retreat.  The Queen knows that she is fighting the clock, and her husband and his men will need help to eventually rebuff the onslaught by the huge Persian army.<br /><br />I didn't read Frank Miller's graphic novel that the film is based on.  However, I would love to see the novel, now,  and compare the two.  Zack Snyder does a great job with this film that leaves you rooting for Leonidas and his out numbered troop of men.  The golden hues of wheat in the fields, the dark gray skies, the coldness of winter are all visually pleasing and the special effects are well done.  All the actors do well with their roles but it is Butler who stands out as Leonidas.  While none of these actors will win accolades for these roles, they nonetheless turn in good performances in the first really entertaining action movie of the year.  Well worth a look!

B000NA28HU|3.0|This movie wasn't the train wreck I expected based upon the commercials and the fact that it lasted only minutes in theaters.  The effects are pretty solid, especially of Saphira herself.  The acting is fair- Eragon himself was decent but there were far too many liberties taken with Brom in my opinion. The book presents him as a wise old man but in the movie he's more of a tough guy. <br /> <br />While it is obvious much material had to be cut out to make the movie a 2 hour affair, I cannot figure out why they completely axed Soumbumm (the Warecat). He was definitely one of the more interesting characters in the book. <br /> <br />Overall a little better than expected. I wish someone would make Jason Rider's Tucker O'Doyle books into movies.

B000NA28HU|4.0|I'm not sure why people are giving this movie such negative reviews.  Personally, I thought that it was pretty good.  It left out a lot of the detail from the book while keeping the main themes/events intact.  I felt that it could have been some longer as it felt a little rushed.  Also, a little more character development might have helped if they make movies based on future books in the series.  I thought that the acting was also very good for the most part, particularly from Edward Speleers, Sienna Guillory, and Jeremy Irons.  The dragon was well animated and looked realistic while Rachel Weisz did a great job with the voice.  Overall, a very enjoyable movie.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" represented a new start for a franchise that desperately needed one. And that meant a fresh, new idea had to be injected into the series.<br /><br />The new idea was two fold: Recreate the very charecter of James Bond in order to get back the younger viewers, while pleasing the \\"core\\" group of 007 fans by going back to Fleming's original charecter; His novels portrayed a hard drinking, chain smoking \\"double-0\\" agent of MI6, who had a \\"License To Kill\\", and used it when commanded to by \\"M\\", all powerful head of Britain's Secret Service. Fleming's Bond had absolutely no guilt or remorse for bringing about the death of another, when necessary. Bond used woman like he used his gun: no guilt, no shame. He didn't trust woman (or anyone for that matter), and knew that he was not much more than a very efficient tool for M.<br /><br />The movies never really grasped the entire complexity of the charecter, nor was there, in the entire history of the franchise, an actor who really fit the Bond that Fleming had described (Read the first few pages of Ian Fleming's \\"Casino Royale\\", and you'll see what I mean).<br /><br />Now I know I just angered a whole bunch of Sean Connery fans, but as well as Connery played the part, he neither \\"looked\\" like Bond, or acted like the ruthless, almost soul-less 007 from the novels.<br /><br />Roger Moore almost ruined the James Bond charecter by portraying him as a parody of himself, practictly every hair in place. Although the films still made money, they started becoming predictable and boring, and I, a huge Bond fan of the novels and films, stopped going to them.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan and his interpertation of James Bond, was kind of like Roger Moore and Sean Connery put together. The plots were somewhat better, but the Hero, with his ever expanding arsenal of gadgets that would always save him, or the girl, just in the nick of time. I watched the films, but I continued to re-read the novels, as the stories more than held up 50 years later, and I loved the Bond of the novels.<br /><br /> I must admit, I sort of enjoyed Brosnan's turn as 007, but it was one of those \\"guilty pleasure\\" kind of things. I know longer reccomended Bond films to my friends, or even admitted seeing them.<br /><br />Apparently, I wasn't the only one, and producers Wilson and Broccili must have sensed this.<br /><br />Because what they did, was go back to the book. \\"Casino Royale\\", Fleming's first Bond adventure, was, and still is one of the most exciting.<br /><br />After aquiring the rights for Casino Royale (the film had been once before, as a spoof of 007.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|There have been many well-stated reviews of this album saying that it's bland and dry and a stale concept that's been done.  And I can appreciate the fact that people have different opinions than I do.  But in all honesty, I can't agree with those statements. <br /> <br />This album has been compared to those of The Fray or U2 or other light rock bands, but man... how can someone say that?  I don't think Stadium Arcadium is the best RHCP album, and it's not the heaviest or coolest or youngest, but I don't know how I feel about 44-year-old Anthony Kiedis rapping on stage about the same things he did 20 years ago.  He's obviously grown, as has the rest of the band, and thank goodness!  We'd all laugh our butts off at these guys if they were just recreated old, fast, funky rock like they did back in the day.  But Stadium Arcadium is a step further in the direction of Californication and By The Way. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, there are some cool, groovy, upbeat songs on the album (\\"Torture Me,\\" \\"Hump de Bump\\" to name a couple), but I'd be lying if I said the discs didn't consist of mostly ballads or mid-tempo songs.  But that's not a bad thing, to me.  \\"Wet Sand\\" is the most beautiful song the Chilis have ever written, as far as I'm concerned, and with the most heartfelt outro they could have come up with.  \\"She Looks to Me\\" is your classic love song. <br /> <br />And people are disregarding these musicians' wonderful talents!  Flea's bass lines aren't like they once were--you won't hear much slapping on this album (although \\"Tell me Baby\\" has a sweet bass line!) but he's forming a new style.  His bass playing has become more melodic and things are evening out between him and Frusciante.  Speaking of which, John has definitely proven himself as a guitar player.  Not only are his solos beautifully melodic or thrashingly fast, but when he's playing just verse and chorus riffs I can't help but smile.  He's got such a great style.  He knows when to let the other bandmembers shine, but he's certainly not afraid to show what he's got. <br /> <br />So overall, I love love love this CD.  If you're into the heavier, more funkified Chili Peppers, I admit that you probably won't go nuts about this CD.  But if you like two discs of great music with Anthony FINALLY learning how to sing properly (just kidding... sorta) then this is a must-have.
B000M3452Y|4.0|I purchased this CD after hearing a thumbs-up music review from Ken Tucker on NPR a couple of weeks ago...and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />I think the album has an 80s sound (kind of a mix of the Talking Heads, Blondie, and The Cars). Lead singer, James Murphy, sounds a lot like David Byrne (of the Talking Heads).  At times, the lyrics can be fairly repetitive, although they are always clever and often quite funny. <br /> <br />For me, what makes this compilation of songs so good is the phenominal beat of this energizing music.  Murphy has effectively infused into this sound an interesting use keyboard, funk guitar, and cowbell (Murphy must have taken to heart Christopher Walken's advice to Will Ferrell in the now-famous SNL skit when he said \\"I got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell!\\").

This film has Spanish subtitles too at your option.<br /><br />Why did I wait unti 2007 to see this film? Too embarrassed to rent in public with all the controversy about it.<br /> I knew Ang Lee from his directing work on &#34;The Hulk&#34; and the stars of the film, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal I may have seen in a movie or two in the past, but could not place the face with the name until this film came out. I didn't even know the proper name of this film. I kept calling it &#34;Broken Mountain&#34;.<br />  This story begins in Signal, Wyoming 1963.  Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet each other as the only two men that show up for a sheep-herding job. The two work on Brokeback Mountain together herding sheep from point A to point B. As two weeks go by, they share their life about each other and how they came to this point in their life. A friendship develops and becomes somewhat deeper.<br />  The job ends in August because of a storm. Jack mentions he might come back next summer.<br />  Ennis gets married in November to Alma. Because of work, their personal lives and living in different states, Jack and Ennis could not travel to see each other then.<br />  Ennis is getting frustrated by his wife and two kids. After four years, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack. He is driving all the way down to see Ennis. When they meet up, it's an emotional one. They hug tightly and kiss each other.<br />  For Ennis, he has been alone most of his life. He keeps himself inside, however Jack was able to open him and Ennis not happy with his married life, really missed Jack. Ennis didn't let those feelings out until he saw Jack again. Jack needs him too.<br />  Can this special friendship continue despite the changes in their personal lives? Jack tries very hard.<br /><br />  The Cinematography is beautiful and well done. The Original Score heart-tugging. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did incredible acting with Ledger's character having pinned up emotions so raw.<br /><br />  Heath Ledger and his co-star Michelle Williams met on the set of &#34;Brokeback Mountain&#34; and became engaged in real-life. Jake Gyllenhaal is godfather to their daughter. (Heath and Michelle separated in 2007.

Option of subtitles: English, Spanish, French.<br />  SPOILER:<br />  I really hated the ending act of this film. It was almost a break-through film, but just as it's about to give you an emotional pay-off, it cuts you cold.<br />  Why is Hollywood so afraid of making a male friendship movie with a happy ending?<br /><br /> A very difficult film for both actors to do, but they both gave outstanding performances.<br /><br />Update: Heath Ledger died January 22, 2008, from an accidental overdose Acute intoxication, combined effects of painkillers, sleeping pills, anti-anxiety medication and other prescription drugs. He was 28. Heath had said he was not sleeping well, 2 or 3 hours only, because he was distraught about his role as the &#34;Joker&#34; in the new Batman movie, THE DARK KNIGHT (2008).

Like his fictional son said in the film during his fight with Mason Dixon \\"Everyone thought this was a joke, including myself! But no one is laughing now!\\" <br /> <br />The story, the acting....everything was well done. I only hope this is the end because I would hate to see it ruined by a bad follow-up. This is a fitting end to the Rocky saga and I would highly recommend this film to anyone's collection whether you're a fan or not!
014028009X|5.0|I'm a forty-something, 20-odd year married male with absolutely no connection to Bridget Jones or any of the characters in this book, and still I find it a hoot. I just love the witty phrasing and preposterous, although for many, I'm sure, realistic, situations Bridget finds herself in. <br /> <br />My wife and I saw the movie recently, and also the follow-up, and had to get the books, too. The storyline is basically the same, but there are many deviances from the movie, enough so that the book feels perfectly fresh and unspoiled. <br /> <br />If you just enjoy witty twists on the english language, you'll probably have fun with this book regardless of what you may think of the plotline and structure. I'm certain though, that people who live a life similar to Bridget's will have even more fun reading her diary.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I've always been a fan of Madonna, her strength of focus and will power are legendary. Legendary, too, are her live shows. This tour stands up as one her best. The stagework, choreography, and Madonna herself are amazing to behold. Madonna is nearing 50, but you wouldn't know it by watching this show. Credit Madonna for keeping herself fit enough to schedule such a grueling show at his point in her life, because some could attempt it, but fail miserably. Vocally, she's amazing. Her voice has never sounded so good, and that shows what hard work she's put into her main tool: her voice. The set list runs the course of her entire career, from \\"Lucky Star\\" to her latest hits, \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Sorry\\". Sure, I would've loved to see more older hits performed, but at least some are included, alongside her new material. The picture quality is fantastic, and the detail is wonderful. The sound is incredible, and overall the whole package is well-planned. Some more bonus material would have been nice, but there is a good concert CD included. The entire concert is not on the CD, but 13 tracks are included. This set is certainly a great purchase, and a welcome addition to any collection.
0743496728|4.0|After a couple of disappointing books, Jodi Picoult is back with a winner.  I always enjoy reading her acknowledgements before reading the book, and then going back to re-read them afterward.   <br /> <br />In \\"Nineteen Minutes,\\" Ms. Picoult dedicates the book to the teens who are \\"different,\\" and her writing shows a great deal of understanding and compassion for them.  This was a thought-provoking read; highly recommended.
1582701709|4.0|How enlighten.It was a new way of thinking for me,what a wonderful change. I came apon Oprah's show half way through, talking about The Secret. I had to check it out. After buying the book, I thought I would share it with my daughter. I will keep this book and read it again and again if I have too. I already purchased the second book for my daughters birthday.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|...on a plane? <br /> <br />/Cover kind of weird for Rush <br />//longtime Rush fan <br />///Rating based on Far Cry
1582701709|4.0|I found this book inspiring.  It's certainly not a new concept as anyone with a metaphysical bent would attest to, but it's put in a baby simple format that's easy to understand.  It's another feel good, the power of positive thinking, type book. And I believe it goes beyond the DVD information wise. I actually believe what Rhonda Byrnes & company are preaching - have so for years - but,like they say, easier said than done. I find it difficult to quiet my mind,really focus and genuinely believe.
0321344758|5.0|Dear Mr. Krug, <br />  <br />Thank you for writing such a user-friendly book.  It was assigned reading for a Masters program in Instructional Technology in which I'm enrolled.  The book stands out like an island of rest in a sea of confusion. <br />  <br />You could have written a book with a lot of filler, and gone on and on as if no one was listening.  But instead you wrote in a way that makes it seems like your talking directly to me. <br />  <br />And in an environment where most everyone else seems to be just throwing up a verbal smoke screen, being addressed personally has been very affirming.  The result is that you've encouraged me to be a Mensch in my own work, even when I'm \\"sure\\" there will be no direct payback. <br />  <br />When I treat people with respect, I find a new world opens up before me. <br />  <br />  <br />Drew
B000FIMG68|2.0|Almost a reality show in that in an effort to maximize profits, the producers hired the cheapest aka: poorest actors available. The real killer of this show is the shaggy obese guy gets bigger each episode, he must be cannibalizing his costars! Remember after all those years on Gilligan's Island the Skipper never lost a pound!
B00005JPCF|1.0|We were going to buy this for our 2 1/2 yr old's easter basket but thank goodness I saw it on a recent flight! We will NOT be buying it for our child - ever. <br />Yes, the animation is fantastic and the penguins are oh-so cute, but that can only carry so much weight. <br />Nicole Kidman's breathy, Marilyn Monroe-ish voice was annoying. And then there was Robin Williams with 2 parts -oy vey! <br />But the worst part was the over the top drama that has no place in a children's movie - Mumble was shunned by his penguin society, then \\"rescued\\" and \\"brainwashed\\" at a zoo -- DEPRESSING!!!! <br />Social commentary can be (and has been) seamlessly woven into movies time and time again but didn't work here in its heavy handed way. <br />Save your money!
B00005JPMX|4.0|I was 6 or 7 during the TMNT craze more than a decade ago.  So of course I was intrigued yet skeptical about seeing them on the big screen again in more than a decade.  I was pleasantly surprised that they hadn't changed much.    Good news for Raphael fans like me.  His character is focused on quite a lot, as he has now taken up crime fighting in disguise at night, against the wishes of their sensai Splinter the rat.  It gives him sort of a Batman/Wolverine quality that I liked.  Leonardo is also at the forefront of this movie as well, returning home to his family after training alone in the jungles of South America.  Donatello and Michaelangelo take a backseat to all this but still play their part and get in on plenty of the action.    Casey Jones makes a grand return to the series and plays off Raphael and April the best.  Speaking of April, this is my favorite interpretation of her I've seen.  She's no longer the pesky, whiny reporter looking for \\"a big scoop\\" and getting into trouble in the process.  Instead she can take care of herself now and makes a welcome addition to the team.    Splinter's voice was probably my least favorite aspect, but that's a minor complaint.  All the turtles were voiced by actors who obviously knew the characters and played them well.  CG animation is the perfect medium for this type of movie.  Definitely not realistic looking, but added to the cartoony nature of the idea of giant turtles.  The turtles definitely looked better than the humans.  I think the action sequences benefitted from that over the limitations of the live action movies.  Some of the \\"camera\\" angles were definitely well crafted during the battles especially.    I enjoyed seeing the foot clan play a part in it as well.  Seeing them animated to fight they way they did I enjoyed a lot better than the live action foot.  These guys moved like ninjas.  Maybe just the anime style is what I liked about it.  I enjoyed the little details as well that they threw in there.  The broken canister of ooze on the shelf along with Shredder's helmet was a nice touch.    Of course like any comic book movie, they set it up for a sequel.  We'll just have to wait and see if they can keep it up or even top this.  I just hope we can see Bebop and Rocksteady.  Perhaps even Krang.  I'm actually starting to get excited at the thought.  I hope I don't get dissapointed now that my hopes are up.
B00002SWEM|5.0|Loved this DVD because it's useful on so many levels for my Spanish class.  Can use it for cultural discussions of music, social issues, history of Cuba, current policies toward Cuba, etc.  Most expecially, kids like music and the life stories of the musicians are quite moving.  Also, for the beginning student, many of the singers' dialogs are also not too hard for them to follow.
B000BHN7D4|5.0|This cd contains all the great songs that make us so love Anastacia.  She is at her best and a must have for your collection.
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 days is the most abstract and least approachable Tool album. Though I am a die-hard fan, it took longer (few days vs. few hours) to absorb than past albums. It's an amazing journey of an album. My girlfriend, newly introduced to Tool, likes their older work better. To her, the latter albums, Lateralus and 10,000 days, sound 'more the same'. I know better and at the same time I know what she means, hence my comment of 'least approachable'. Not a condemnation - I've given the album 5 stars. I like that the band has chosen to evolve it's music. I think is is necessary for timeless bands to do so - Led Zepplin and the Beatles, for example.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Not only is Pink an amazing singer, but she is an awesome songwriter.  She is not scared to 'go there' with her lyrics so you wind up getting the real deal from her.  I love people who aren't afraid to write about the sad times because a lot of people needs to hear something they can relate to.   One of the standouts, 'Family Potrait', speaks to kids who are dealing with divorced parents. Basically, this album is a work of art so it's hard to choose favorites, but if I had to, my favorites would be  Don't let me get me, Just Like a Pill, Family Potrait and Lonely Girl.  Pink's voice is soo raw and real that you can actually feel the pain in her voice.  Once you listen to this album, you will want hear more.   So I will go ahead and let you know that her third album is Try This and her fourth, which is her best thus far is \\"I'm Not Dead\\".  So please give this album a chance.  Pink is a real artist and she will be around for a long time because she is true to herself and she write exactly how she feels which makes her a true artist.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Quirky.<br /><br />Unconventional.<br /><br />But it works.<br /><br />Will Farrell, showing that he has dramatic range, gives maybe the most impressive performance of his career.  His character, Harold Crick, a stiff, lifeless, almost robotic IRS agent, comes to life as he falls in love with a bohemian baker, Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal.)  Emma Thompson is believable as a neurotic but brilliant novelist suffering from writer's block.  Dustin Hoffman carries water as a literature professor who helps Harold figure out what is happening to him.  There's not a bad performance in the film.<br /><br />You will see the outcome from a mile away.  Or at least you think you can.  There's enough doubt about which way the story's going to keep your attention.<br /><br />Stranger Than Fiction is very funny but not in the way that most Hollywood \\"comedies\\" are.  It's full of off-beat humor a la Rushmore.  Don't rent (or buy) it expecting Old School or anything like Will's Saturday Night Live bits.  The humor's more subtle than that.<br /><br />Besides being unique - the story is a breath of fresh air given that Hollywood only seems to excel these days at remaking old movies and TV shows - it is beautifully filmed.  One of the most enjoyable aspects, for me, of this movie is that it was shot right in downtown Chicago.  There's a lot of life and art - beautiful architecture and urban landscapes - in the setting.  The GUI (graphic user interface) bits give the film another visual dimension.<br /><br />All in all, Stranger Than Fictions' a nice movie.  If there are flaws they are that the story slows in spots and that the connection between Harold and Ana is a little hard to swallow.  Nevertheless, it's one of the more interesting movies to come out of Hollywood in the last few years.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|This season is one of the best. Leo finally gets to spend some time with his family even though it is not for free. We finally et to see Wyatt in action, and just when Piper thinks that she can really have a normal life, well...Moving on to demons, Zankou is one of the best demons the series ever had, he can even be compared to Barbas.Other than that, the twist that the series will take from this season on, it's going to be interesting i know first hand. Great season(and great price)
B000NA28IE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I had listened to both books on tape and found them facinating and thoroughly thrilling. I wish the movie could have incorporated more from the book but working with a limited amount of time I think they did and excellent job. The characters were fairly well developed and the choice of actors was excellent. Saphira was beautiful and her essense was so very well rendered. I'm very much looking forward to seeing books 2 and 3 put on film. I will watch them without a doubt and will continue to listen to the tapes over and over again. I am 57 years old. You see what you choose to see and not compare to other like enterprises. I was lost in the fantasy that could only be Eragon.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|It's about time! This is George Benson and Al Jarreau at their finest. A nice surprise is to find Paul McCartney on the last track. Great addition to our collection of Benson, Jarreau and McCartney!
B00000JGHS|5.0|As a long time Carl Hiassen reader, I was expecting a good dose of quirkiness, a little bit of social comment and a lot of over the top foolishness.  I were not disappointed.  Anyone looking for a serious film, with a believable plot and subtle characters should watch something else.  \\"Strip Tease\\" is nothing but fun, and lots of it.  I found the strip scenes to be very well done, enjoyed the quality of the dancing, and laughed heartily at the striper's names.  You've got to love \\"Masada Retirement Home\\", and of course, the bouncer's weapon of choice is pure delight. No complaints.  This is a terrific film.
0143038419|5.0|I bought this book because I loved the title.  From the very first page you become hooked.  This memoir reads like a novel.  Elizabeth Gilbert has a writing style that grabs you and won't let go.  I was sorry when I got to the end because I wanted this book to go on and on.  I have since bought this book for other friends because I know they would enjoy it and ordered her other books that I can't wait to devour.  I have found a wonderful new author--praise to you Elizabeth Gilbert.
B000NA28IE|3.0|Please book reviewers, review the books, movie reviewers review the movies, and never the twain should meet. Make you a deal I won't review books and expect them to be as good as the movies if you won't review the movies and expect them to be good as the books. Is it a deal? No offence but I rarely read a book reviewers review of a movie and hear anything but the movie stank.<br /><br />I didn't read these books so I can't say anything about them. But a good example is I did read the J.R.R. Tolkien books for years, long before the movies. The movies were not as good as the books, but you know what I loved the movies anyway. I realize that there was no way Peter Jackson could put all that was in the books into movies. Now if you say, I wished they had covered something better, I can understand and appreciate that. Just please don't trash it because it doesn't have everything from the book.<br /><br />I liked it myself. They obviously ended it in a way they could make a sequel. If you like medieval and fantasy movies you will probably like it. If you enjoy movies about Dragons you will probably love it. Not as good as \\"Dragonheart\\", but certainly well worth seeing. I think with a little more comedy from a well known actor and it would have been outstanding. That's why \\"Dragonheart\\" stands out so clearly in my mind is a few nice comedy moments put in to lighten the mood some of the time. Good family movie and good replayability.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The film is compelling and scary!  Mankind has created a global warming morass that has placed this planet and all of us who inhabit it at great risk!  Every attempt, at least so, far about remediating and reversing this rend has fallen on deaf ears to this country which is the single largest contributor to global warming than any other nation.  We mus act to reverse this trend.  We have the technolgy and the resources to get it done - we lack the WILL to do it.
B000JLTRIG|4.0|my family loves the charmed series, there are several good plots and characters in the series. their are several good actors and actresses.
B00005JPMC|1.0|I, like every other sensible person, count Stephen Hunter's Point of Impact as one of the world's best books. And I was enthusiastic about \\"Shooter\\" starring Mark Wahlberg. I've seen it. And despite my positive attitude, it isn't worth much. Though I can tell you why it has good reviews.     The good news is that Wahlberg does a good job of playing a straight-up Rambo action hero. There is no hint of backwoods or \\"country\\" in the character (the real Bob the Nailer sounded like Gomer Pyle), and the words \\"the nailer\\" are never spoken. Kate Mara as Sarah Fenn is just beautiful and definitely Kentucky. It is a standard if pedestrian action flick with head shots, fights and big explosions.  If that's all it was, it might be worth it just to see Kate Mara in that thin t-shirt. If only it was.    However... it is a very much a POLITICAL \\"message\\" movie. The enemy is the US government. The \\"hero\\" wears a \\"Che\\" T-shirt and the bad guys have offices adorned with portraits of Republican presidents (HW Bush, Teddy Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover and Ronald Reagan). The Abu Ghraib reference and \\"sitting Secretary of Defense lying\\" speech are typical of the movie. This movie implies a 9-11 government conspiracy and accuses our soldiers of killing women and children (for an oil pipeline, naturally). The big battle is not against South American killers involved in a drug cartel, but US soldiers, and he uses home-made bombs to get them. The old gunsmith talks about how he was lied to about artificial sweeteners and WMD's in Iraq. Swagger is led down the wrong path by \\"patriotism\\", though he doesn't like the President (or the last one either). He has never been to Vietnam,as that might imply there had been heroic Americans there. Sam Vincent,the old country lawyer in the book, is not there. Nick Memphis is just another FBI guy.    The reason it is getting good reviews--other than it is an adequate action movie--is because of the leftist message adored by the media. It's an action movie for whacky libs, conspiracists and Bush-haters. I'm sure others will see this move. I'll be surprised if they don't report that it is more like \\"Michael Moore does Point of Impact with a yuppie hero (A George Soros Production)\\" than the book and character we all admire.
B000KQGP2G|4.0|While widening my exploration of the InsideOut music stable, I encountered Pain of Salvation several years ago via their album Be. Though it never became a favorite album, I liked it well enough to give Pain of Salvation a second hearing. I suppose I could have started anywhere, but I liked the cover of Scarsick so I settled on it.  When it arrived, I listened several times, read the accompanying booklet of lyrics and some of the reviews here. I have to agree with several of the reviewers who say the lyrics are redolent of collegiate neo-Marxist cant. On the other hand, they serve to feed your rage no matter which side of the political divide you are on. This is decidedly hard left in slant but I still enjoy it despite being unabashedly capitalist. I have to admit that George W Bush has made himself and our country a tempting target for foreigners predisposed to hate and envy American success with his mind-boggling incompetence.  Here's what I like:  1)The title cut Scarsick sets the mood.  2)I hate rap, but if I had to listen to it Spitfall makes it palatable. This song just absolutely savages hip-hop \\"culture\\".  3)Cribcaged hammers the pretensions of the elite. It uses that \\"f\\" word repeatedly, but captures perfectly how millions feel.  4)I hate disco as much as rap, but Disco Queen is great lyrically. Though it is somewhat reminiscent of Zappa's comic Dancing Fool, it is much darker.  5)Kingdom of Loss, though not as musically vital as some of the preceding, is an excellent stab at rampant consumerism reminsicent of recent work by The Tangent.  6)Idiocracy is anti-globalization rant par excellence. Lots of sloganeering, though, and shows little understanding of a complex issue.  7)Screaming, maniacal anger infuses Flame to the Moth, another Daniel Gildenlow neo-Luddite tirade.  8)The album's opus magnum, Enter Rain, closes this pessimistic epic with a shot of apocalyptic hope.  Though Pain of Salvation is classified as prog-metal, I find it to be much closer to heavy metal than to prog, although its music is suffused with subtle progressive elements. Scarsick is certainly not for tender ears. However, its a great CD for energizing and focusing an inchoate rage. Put this on and crank it up anytime you are pissed off at the world in general.
B000I5X80G|4.0|okay, okay, i wish it were longer, too. i just can't get as upset over the brevity of this cd as other reviewers on amazon have gotten. i love this cd! as a neil young fan, and a person who does not buy bootlegs, this release is the cat's meow. the frenetic guitar jams on \\"down by the river\\" and \\"cowgirl in the sand,\\" between neil young and danny whitten are worth the price of admission alone. \\"winterlong,\\" available nowhere else on a legitimate release, is a fine addition to my neil young collection, as well. i hope that much more early live neil young is on the way. this thing really whet my appetite.
B00005JLWN|3.0|Ok, So I just read 10 perfect reviews for this movie and figured I'd put in my two cents.  <br /> <br />There are so many similarities between this and the matrix that it's hard to ignore, and made it difficult for me to take the movie seriously. Considering this movie came out right after the matrix, you think they could have gone out of there way to separate it a little better. Lets see what we have. <br /> <br />Protagonist with dark slicked back hair? Check. <br />Black main character with shaved head and black suit? Check. <br />Gunfight scene in a long hallway with people blasting bullets through pillars? Check. <br />Obligatory sword fight scene for sake of looking cool when guns would have worked just as well? Check. <br />Plot revolving around the human race being mind controlled after the apocalypse and the hidden network of people who resist being hunted down? Check.  <br />Obligatory hard electronic music playing during fight scenes? (It seemed a little out of place, nothing any of the characters would listen to.) <br /> <br />Ok, basically you're watching the same movie. The fighting scenes were good, but over the top. Nothing really new, though lacking the effects that propelled The Matrix. There's also a really cheesy scene with a puppy. <br /> <br />There's also something else, since this movie is based around emotion being outlawed, that's what you get through the movie. All characters are more or less one dimensional. Nobody laughs in this movie, no bickering, no reactions or real exchange of dialogue outside of the action. I know this was the point, but perhaps it was done a little TOO well, because in the end I had no attachment to any of the characters. <br /> <br />All in all it's a decent sci-fi movie, but there are so much that I've enjoyed more. You would probably enjoy this alot more if you hadn't seen the Matrix, but in that case, you'd enjoy the Matrix better. It's done this before, and got it right. <br /> <br />PS. Sean Bean's role gaveme some LotR Deja Vu, but I'm not giving anything away. ;)
B000JLPMPS|5.0|Pretty much everything has been said about this movie...it is Eastwood's best Western, which it achieves by dropping all the trappings of Western films.  It's ironic, but this film can be considered an anti-western, anti-violence film, because it depicts it in such a truthful and brutal way, which makes for a stark difference to the usual glorification of violence/gunplay seen in the Westerns of old.   <br /> <br />The blu-ray transfer is just about perfect.  For the age of the film, it's quite beautiful, especially when you see the panoramic views and harsh beauty of the West the film represents.   <br /> <br />This blu-ray disk is also loaded with extras...many featurettes about Clint Eastwood, as both a director and an actor.  There is also a full episode of \\"Maverick,\\" an old Western TV show, that features Clint Eastwood in one of his earlier performances. <br /> <br />I highly recommend you get this film, period.
B00005JNX0|3.0|Madagascar is the story of 4 zoo animals in Central Park (a lion, a giraffe, a hippo, and a zebra) that find themselves, through various twists of fate, on an island in the middle of the ocean. No more cages, no more zoo. But also no more free food or people to take care of them. (Neither of those ideas is really examined all that much in the film, just briefly mentioned).<br /><br />The animation is a bit blocky and the plot is a bit thin, but I'm sure it will entertain kids. The problem is that in this day and age we expect our animated films to do more than mindlessly entertain our children, we expect to be entertained as well. Unfortunately, Madagascar does not meet those expectations.<br /><br />Despite the big names this animated film boasts (Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Cedric the Entertainer, Sacha Baron Cohen) the film feels a bit lackluster. That's partly due to the fact that none of these actors (Baron Cohen aside) know how to create a feasible character voice. These are name actors paid to sound like themselves. But a zebra with Chris Rock's voice is not entertaining, it's actually kind of annoying. The same goes for a giraffe with David Schwimmer's voice and a hippo with Smith's voice. Ben Stiller doesn't put forth much effort, but his lion, Alex, at least has a bit of character mixed in there. Sacha Baron Cohen definitely steals the film with his lemur-king Julien, but unfortunately he doesn't show up until halfway through the film.<br /><br />The roll of the credits featuring Baron Cohen's Julien chanting \\"I like to move it move it!\\" is probably the most exciting and inspired part of the entire film. Although it's not a bad film, with all the other animation being made today, it's not particularly special.
B000002GYR|4.0|it was a beautiful spring afternoon. i was up on a ladder, cleaning out the gutters on our suburban dream-home. suddenly i slipped. next thing i know, i'm coming to in a hospital bed all bound up with a neck-brace and the works. i was alone, confused. then from down the hallway i heard this album being played on a boom-box. i smiled, cause i knew everything was going to be alright.
B000CR1XSE|5.0|I love this film The Snowman.  I always used it when I taught preschool in the month of January, right after we returned from winter break.  The music and story take you on a great journey.
B000J6I0VG|4.0|At first glance, you'll probably write this off as a kid's movie.  In one way, you are probably right, it is a kid's movie mainly in the fact that your kids will definetly enjoy it.  However, you might find that you enjoy it as well.   <br /> <br />The plot is a simple hero coming-of-age story.  What makes it interesting is that our protagonist is a third generation \\"hero,\\" but not only that, he's the son of the two most celebrated heroes.  Add into the mix the fact that he has not shown any \\"hero\\" powers, and you got a nice combination for this action-family flick, as our protagonist heads into SKY HIGH, the superhero school.   <br /> <br />Now, for the blu-ray transfer itself.  While I'm not a videophile, I was pleased with the quality and look of this encoding.  Disney apparently goes all out with their movies in regards to PQ, and it shows.  It also has a scene showcase, which plays all the scenes where the Hi-def content really pops out at you.   <br /> <br />There are a few extras, such as the \\"making of the film\\" like featurettes, and if I remember correctly, a commentary. <br /> <br />All and all, I recommend this film for your kids, and even for yourself, if you were ever into comic books and the like.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|Unlike Saw II, Saw III starts off on shaky ground and feels a bit forced. The traps are gorier and harder, while we find that we don't care all that much about the characters themselves. The acting is still good, but the story doesn't seem to meet the muster of the first sequel.<br /><br />The unresolved surprise ending involving Detective Matthews in Saw II is dealt with thoroughly here and answers many questions. But Saw III involves a new cast of characters to be tested by Jigsaw's games. Along with his sidekick Amanda, Jigsaw has kidnapped a female doctor and hooked his life support system to a device around her neck that will fire six rounds into her head if his heartbeat ever stops. Meanwhile a man whose son was a victim of a hit and run is forced to walk through rooms where each person who took part in that incident is being tortured in front of him.<br /><br />As the film goes on, the suspense seems to be dropping as the audience wonders why they should care about any of this. And although Jigsaw and Amanda provide a formidable evil duo, the momentum begins to drop due to an excess of gore and a cacophany of screams.<br /><br />In the end, though, it all pays off, and although the film itself doesn't live up to the original sequel, it's still much more interesting and mind-bending than most other horror films of this time. For a 3rd installment in a franchise, Saw III is a top-quality movie. The twists and the twisted nature of the film will leave fans eager for a fourth.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Tarantino makes movies about other movies: his films lift everything from characters to plot devices to camera angles, glosses up the costumes and attitudes, laces them with adolescent humor, and then swirls all the bits and pieces together in a tub of blood.  The results have been extremely inconsistent but never less than interesting in at least an academic, art house sort of way.<br /><br />KILL BILL, VOLUME 1 is essentially a teenage boy's blood and sex fantasy run amuck.  The story is so classically revenge it might have--and maybe was--inspired by Elizabethan drama.  A woman who has been a member of an international squad of hired assasins becomes pregnant and decides to marry and retire; at her wedding reception, however, her handler and co-killers crash the event and kill every one.  Well, almost every one: she survives.  Four years later she awakens from a coma, is mightily ticked about the whole thing, and decides to kill everyone who was involved in the attack.<br /><br />As in PULP FICTION, Tarantino borrows a great deal from a host of film masters, perhaps most notably from Hitchcock, Kubric, Altman, Stone, and Lynch: narrative camera angles that rise to provide a bird's eye view of the actors as they move through the sets, disjointed time, overlapping plots, and a heavily stylized visual sense.  He also borrows a great deal from 1960s and 1970s \\"trash cinema,\\" most particularly Kung Fu foolishness and deliberately sparse spaghetti Westerns.  In terms of story and overall execution, however, this is essentially the stuff of a pimple-ridden teenage boy's blood and sex fantasies: sexy women fighting, shooting, and slashing the hell out of each other.<br /><br />In this instance Tarantino gets away with it because he seldom gives you very much time to think about any of it--and on the rare occasions when he does, he goes out of his way to point out his various juxtapositions with a gleefull \\"I Meant To Do That!\\" finger.  And there is a lot about the film that is quite funny in the same pitch black, subversive way that PULP FICTION was funny.  Two women square off in a snow-drenched Japanese garden to Spanish music and so on, the sort of small inter-cultural cinematic jibe that Tarantino does so well when he puts his mind to it.  It's actually very entertaining.<br /><br />But there is a problem here, and it is the same problem that has plagued every one of Tarantino's films.  Yes, the film is deliberately trendy in a truly relentless way and often very funny as a result; yes, the fight choreography is visually stunning; yes, the deliberate clash of music and visuals and cultures is often very witty.  But in the end it is all a surface cleverness with nothing underneath, and the film is really Tarantino's ode to how hip and cool he wants us to think he is.  We never see him on the screen, but we're constantly aware of him standing off to one side screaming \\"LOOK AT ME!\\"  You might describe the whole thing as an entertaining study in the director's overcompensation for not actually being the \\"super-cool\\" guy of his own cinematic fantasies.<br /><br />Note to Mr. Tarantino: as a friend of mine is fond of saying, \\"cool\\" can't be acquired, it simply is, and you either have it or you don't.  I've never met you, but I'm pretty sure that you aren't a quarter as \\"cool\\" as you tell people you are, and I'm also pretty certain that you know it yourself.  Now, you actually seem to be a talented guy; why don't you stop this foolishness and actually do your own movie instead of tap-dancing through all the stuff, good and bad, you saw when you were fifteen?<br /><br />That said, I actually rather liked the film.  (A lot of people won't.  It is very bloody and the humor involved is dark.)  It's worth a look, and if you don't expect anything except pure surface you may well enjoy it.  But it's not something I'll watch again and I can't see myself going out of the way to see KILL BILL VOLUME 2.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerfilm that is quite funny in the same pitch black, subversive way that PULP FICTION was funny.

B0000214F0|1.0|A poor documentary. An attempt to make porn acceptable and very unsexy at that. A repulsive movie.   <br />Watch instead the recent made for TV series entitled Rome.  The series Rome is accurate and entertaining and without a doubt the best of its type ever made.
0689865384|4.0|I think this book has a lot of imaginaation. I didn't like how some of the action scenes were described so quickly and with so little detail because most of the time I'd be wondering \\"WHAT?\\" and read the whole paragraph or page or whatever over again. But I think that is a small complaint and it didn't stop me form reading it so, it's all good.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|The acting is excellent, the locales exotic and the cinematography is beautiful. The problem is, it all adds up to nothing but a trio of banal stories from which the director is deperate to extract meaning from coincidence.  <br /> <br />I suppose one of the Grand Themes is how we are all interconnected, or how it's a small world after all or some such sitcom-level Deep Thoughts. I suppose this might come as a revelation to anyone who's never thought about anything before, but hitting the audience over the head with contrived melodrama and overwrought peril for 2+ hours doesn't make it any less trite.  <br /> <br />The characters are stereoypes, the script is lazy and superficial, expecting the audience to do the work of supplying motivations to the characters. Any tragedy is generated in the laziest way possible: by contriving extreme, implausible situations.  <br /> <br />If the movie didn't look so good and didn't have such a strong cast, I wouldn't have given this waste of time any stars.

But this CD doubled what love I already had for her.  <br /> <br />Take a listen to my number ONE favorite song on this album, \\"My Dear Country,\\" and you'll see why... wow. Every word in this song I agree with. It's definately a protest-ing kind of song. But totally Nora-fied. lol. My favrorite line: \\"I love the things that you've given me. And most of all that I am free to have a song that I can sing on election day...\\" Wow.

B000DZIGDU|3.0|Jarhead describes Desert Shield and Desert Storm operations through the eyes of a US Marine sniper. <br />In short, the music, the setting and the acting are pretty good, while the plot is interesting.  Nevertheless, the characters are not that likable, the dialogues could have been better, and it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it; No masterpiece here. <br />
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's book would stand alone on its own merits as a breathtaking autobiography (I wish that people who have English as their native tongue could write so well!).  Add to that the book's insights on a number of African and Middle Eastern cultures, its observations on Islam, its comments on Europe's politics and welfare states, and its analysis of human psychology...    This book is simply fascinating on many levels.  I don't know if I want to compare the author with Voltaire or Spinoza, but her strength of character is truly amazing. [..]

B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I have to agree with many of the other optimistic reviewers who say that this album must be listened to with an open mind, and not to expect a duplication of some of the band's previous work.  If you think about it, almost all of Incubus' albums have attracted some kind of criticism upon their release: \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\" was too nu-metal, Chili Peppers-ish.  \\"Make Yourself\\" had too much filler.  \\"Morning View\\" was too over-produced.\\"  \\"A Crow Left Of The Murder\\" was too experimental.  And now all the criticism for the brilliant \\"Light Grenades\\"?  I don't get it.   <br /> <br />Now on to the review of the actual album.  First and foremost, when you get a chance to pick up this album, listen to Track 10, \\"Rogues\\", immediately.  It is hands-down the best song on the album, and is definitely one of the best of the band's entire catalog.  \\"Quicksand\\" and \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off\\" are an amazing way to open the album, and really get it off to an explosive start. <br /> <br />One of the most overlooked songs on the album will most likely be \\"Oil And Water.\\"  It has a very unusual time structure and is a little off-putting to listen to at first, but for sure ranks up there with the strongest songs on the album.  Another song that gives both \\"Rogues\\" and \\"Oil And Water\\" a run for their money is the ingenius \\"Penduluous Threads.\\"  Mike Einziger's guitar prowess are on high display during this song, and I have to say, this is one that I would have really liked to have heard live on their most recent tour. <br /> <br />All in all, a great album.  Pick it up (don't download) at your local record store and give it a few rotations.  You'll be glad you did!

0751532711|4.0|I'd have to say this book, as said before, would be a lot better for those looking to START along the \\"path to becoming wealthy.\\" Not real great for people already right smack in the middle of their lives. Its a good, quick read for anyone interested in finance / managing money but I'm sure there's better.
B000002GYW|4.0|\\"Desperado\\" was one of the most important albums of the seventies in that it firmly established the Eagles as something more than Linda Rondstadt's backup band. From the title track to \\"Saturday Night\\" (a live version of which is done very well on 1980's \\"Eagles Live\\"....) there isn't a stinker amongst the mix. In fact, one of my favorite lines from the album is from \\"Certain Kind of Fool: \\"....and it's a certain kind of fool that likes to hear the sound of his own name.....\\" (How many politicians and celebrities can we apply THAT to...) <br /> <br />All in all, it's a very enjoyable album in the Poco/Pure Prarie League vein.....
B00006LIRI|4.0|Cd 1 is the best of 1990-2000, well I dissagree.  \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" is under representated, it is one of the best of the band and had many hits but this compilation has only two tracks ?  <br />What about \\"Elevation\\", \\"Kite\\" or \\"Walk on\\" ? <br />As I said for the other double cd \\"best of 1980-1990\\", you have most of the hits but you do not have the best songs.  Some great songs are missing simply because they didn't have been played on radio, so don't try to find them on this double cd. The title \\"greatest hits\\" would be closer to reality than \\"The best of\\" <br /> <br />The bonus cd will me you feel in a discotheque ! Some interesting remixed version like \\"Mysterious Ways\\", \\"If God will send his angels\\"  or \\"Even better than the real thing\\". The bonus cd is for die hard fans !

B000001EAQ|3.0|In my opinion, this is the weakest cd from U2 since their first two albums.  Few good cuts like \\"Discotheque\\", \\"If God will send his angels\\", <br />\\"Staring at the sun\\", \\"Gone\\" and \\"Wake up dead man\\". The other tracks are a bit dissapointing for me, I understand that some might like it a lot but I don't...Sorry ...but I still like this band a lot.
074356619X|3.0|This book has many redeeming ideas, but I felt it was too focussed on materialism.  I also did not agree that we bring on all sickness and all tragedies by failing to think positive thoughts.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I was surprised by the reviews about Sigourney Weaver as the narrator of this series because I just didn't have any bias either way about her.  As I listened to her narration, I realized that Sigourney's voice is both commanding and nurturing - appropriate for the subject matter of this documentary.  She did an excellent job!  I love the documentary as well, awe-inspiring.  Maybe this will help rally humans to care more about what happens to the planet for we are merely passing through.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|When I first heard Sylvester Stallone was writing a sixth Rocky movie, I cringed. There was the initial dread of seeing an old Rocky in the ring coupled with the huge disappointment that was Rocky 5. Although too embarrassed to see it in theaters, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this film on DVD, surely as fitting an ending as possible to one of my favorite action series.<br /><br />But this film certainly doesn't fit in comfortably with the others, understandably so. This isn't the 80s. Rocky's wife is dead. He's older, slower and no longer involved with boxing except in telling old fightin' tales to customers of his modest restaurant in South Philly. Paulie is back and as annoying as usual, but this serves as a contrast to the humble, loyal Rocky we all know and love.<br /><br />If you've seen the previews there are no big surprises. This movie isn't about a glorified exhibition match of a 50-something ex-champ versus a 30-something Antonio Tarver in his prime. It's about growing old, doing what you love and the importance of family. Adrian's memory is alive and well (plenty of flashbacks). Rocky's son is struggling to cope with the shadow of his beloved father, which follows him even in the corporate world.<br /><br />At the end of the day, you're not supposed to hate \\"villain\\" Mason 'the line' Dixon. This fight is a reminder of what Rocky used to be and a great ending to a series spanning four decades. True Rocky fans will concur.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This edition is super!  It is digitally mastered quite well and has a portion on the DVD bonus material so you can view the difference.  The commentaries as well as the interviews with the original cast is fabulous!  This is my all-time favorite movie---which I even enjoy more since viewing the bonus materials about the making of the movie, interviews with the cast, etc.  The bonus materials are about 6 hours long so you can pick and chose. Worth every penny to buy the 40th anniversary edition.!!!  My 4, 12, and 15 old boys love this movie!
B0009UC810|5.0|... I was not interested in seeing this movie because Akroyd and Belushi are very far of being my favorites actors (I don't think they'll ever be), and their names being the only ones seen on the poster...  <br /> <br />But, recently, I got some more information, and saw this movie. I must admit I did enjoy it, first of all because of the music and the performers, and second because John Landis managed to get the 2 (so-called) stars less insufferable than what I've seen them doing before. <br /> <br />As well, the REAL Stars' performances (James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, etc.) are so enjoyable that I didn't mind the pretext story used to be the link. And even more, I found this 'pretext' story better than the one used in \\"Stormy Weather\\", where, by the way, Cab Calloway was 37 years younger. Which is why I think this movie deserves \\"5 stars\\".
B000HIVO64|4.0|Beck is one of my favorite artists, so it's no surprise that I went to go pick up The Information. While I wouldn't exactly call this his greatest album (for that, take your pick between Odelay, Midnite Vultures and Guero), it's pretty darn good in its own right.<br /><br />Speaking of Guero, though, I guess I'm in the minority when I say that I really don't see this album as a combination of that album and Sea Change (because among other things, Sea Change was about nothing but heartbreak). But this album still has plenty of great songs for the Beck enthusiast, like \\"Think I'm In Love\\" and especially the Grammy-nominated \\"Nausea\\". And if you want some more hip-hop-flavored tunes, try \\"Elevator Music\\" or \\"1000BPM\\" on for size. There's also \\"No Complaints\\", which should have you saying just that.<br /><br />Beck has never been for everyone, but even I can't get into a few of these tracks, particularly \\"New Round\\". \\"Soldier Jane\\" also has a strange second chorus (not to mention that it doesn't sound much different from \\"Think I'm In Love\\"), and the spoken word \\"Exoskeleton\\" didn't do anything for me. But everything else that The Information holds makes it great enough to add to your Beck collection.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B0002EXH4A|4.0|So Far So good, but not their best, Being 8 tracks long this album still spawned classic megadeth tracks such as Set the world afire and in my darkest hour. The former being Mustaine's first composition after leaving metallica, was done with the intent of being faster and harder than his former band could achieve, and also gave rise to the band's name. The opening track (into the lungs of hell) is also killer, and is fashioned after the poem 'the charge of the light brigade' which is work based on St. Michael's offensive on hell after lucifer's exile from heaven. Other notable tracks include Mary Jane, Anarchy in The UK (a sex pistols cover), and Hook In Mouth which is a catchy tune aimed at music censorship.
B000063DIR|2.0|I just put \\"Tonight\\" on a list of my 20 favorite guitar songs and was SHOCKED when I saw the 2 star review of this. How could ANYONE give one of THE greatest hard rock albums EVER recorded only 2 stars. Randy's magnificent playing alone deserves 5 stars!!!<br /><br />Then I went into the list,started reading the other reviews and it seems the problem everyone has is with the sound. I wouldn't know, this was one of the 1st 4 CDs I bought WAY back in 1986 and I still have that original. Sounds ok to me. Glad I never bought this \\"remix\\".<br /><br />But I do have one comment to you people, you seem to have forgotten a few things......I remember folks running around with 2nd & 3rd generation Maxell cassettes of this in the summer of 1982. I remember hearing \\"Over the Mountain\\" coming out of the mono speaker in a Ford Pinto DASH BOARD for Gosh sakes!!! And it sounded GREAT!! So I personaly feel that there's NO WAY an album THIS MAGNIFICENT could ever get less than 4 stars....no matter how it sounds :)<br /><br />But, not owning it and never having heard it (that I know of), I hesitate to go with anything other than the 2 star average.<br /><br />And, another gripe....for over 25 years rumors have circulated that the end solo of \\"Tonight\\" actually went on for anywhere between 3 & 10 more minutes but Ozzy was contracted to deliver an album under 40-42 minutes so they cut this solo at a little under a minute. Don't know if this is true but if it is, I sure wish Ozzy would release the complete recording!! But then again...he's NEVER released video footage of Randy in DVD format so.....
1582701709|2.0|I was disappointed in this book's rehash of Norman Vincent Peale's insights and ideas.  Some thoughts quoted from outstanding presenters of the \\"Power Of Positive Thinking\\" or the \\"attraction theory\\" were good refreshers of that old theme.
B000FSME1A|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola, the director, has come out and said publicly that the reason why Heart of Darkness was not in this set is because he, or his company American Zoetrope does not own the rights to it. And secondly, Francis is not interested in buying the documentary because he believes the documentary was not accurate in a lot of areas creating a biased version of events. <br /> <br />Either way, Heart of Darkness is not advertised to be in this pack and I don't know why everyone assummed the documentary would be included. For the price that this pack is going for I think it represents really good value and entertainment.
1582701709|2.0|This book says nothing that I haven't read about before.  It just repeats the same thing over and over again.  I did find some of the comments that James Canfield and others who contributed very interesting, and because of that I may buy a book by them.
B00005JOQS|2.0|I haven't seen a Superman movie since the first Christopher Reeve flic back in the 80s, so I'm probably behind the times on these.  Just picked this one up on a whim and, though it had its entertaining moments, it was overall rather mundane. <br /> <br />The special effects were very cool, but they were forced to carry the weight of a lightweight script.  How many times can we see Superman, Lois and family, and \\"the average Joes\\" be in seemingly fatal circumstances only to be rescued at the last second by either the Man of Steel himself, or (in the case of Superman) by Lois?  After a while the pattern gets tedious. <br /> <br />Also, fear I have some quibbles about the acting.  The good guys were merely okay (all of them could have done a lot more to make their characters more fun and memorable), but the bad guys were downright BORING.  Parker Posey seemed like she was asleep while she delivered her lines as Lex Luthor's girlfriend; Kevin Spacey seemed to be trying a little harder to bring Luthor to life, but, alas, he pretty much failed. <br /> <br />Whole cast and crew seemed like they were under the influence of ultrapowerful Kryptonite that kept them weak and sleepy. Too bad.
0812550706|4.0|Tearing a page or two from Asimov's [[ASIN:0553293354 Foundation (Foundation Novels)]], Ender's Game is an excellent look at the effects of war through the eyes of an extremely intelligent child.

0321344758|5.0|Steve Krug's, \\"Don't Make Me Think:  A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability,\\" is as good as any web page design and development management book around.  It's style is based on the principles Krug lays forth of simplicity, minimize textual content, and don't tax people's already overloaded brains.  The way the book was designed, thus, has Krug practicing what he preaches, at all of our benefit.<br /><br />I have been in a position in corporate America to manage a corporate web site since December of 2006.  After some precursory research on my favorite little book store:  Amazon, I came up with Krug's web usabilty book on favorite listmania after favorite listmania.  \\"Don't Make Me Think,\\" made it on the top list for web designers, web page project managers, business owners, and average Joes and Jill like you and me.  So I wanted to start my professional reading with a book that had some common collective wisdom behind it.  Lo and behold, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Krug's book is probably best read through practice.  I have already spouted off several of his principles at our weekly web page project meetings and I can tell folks are looking at me a little different these days.  It could be because I'm going through my mid-life crisis and started wearing a goatee and using all this metero hair product, but I don't think that's the reason alone.  I suspect it's because I scanned Krug's cartoons and sent them out to the members of our working group and executive council.  I love the frame that has the project manager getting caught up in a web page design \\"religious debate,\\" between a creative designer and a practical programmer with a thought bubble over her head saying, \\"I hate my life.\\"  Funny stuff.  You'll have to read this book and sit through one of the web page design meetings to see its true truth and wisdom.<br /><br />Though I've learned if you try to enact some of Krug's principles like having navigation tabs similar to those found on Amazon, you just may start some religious debates of your own.  The book has a little something for everyone.  For the web page design and management neophytes like myself, it has to be one of the best introductions to the ins and outs of what really works on web sites for engaging Internet users in such a way that keeps them coming back for more.  For seasoned professionals in the industry, Krug's book will no doubt cause you to be challenged in your thinking, wrestle with how to gain control back from your overly-busy home page, and what can now be done with all that text you were stuffing your overly boring corporate site that no one really bothers to read.<br /><br />For me the book started to drag with the two sections of web site testing.  But, we recently stood up a new functionality feature that was in sore need of troubleshooting testing before pushing it live.  Believe it or not, designers and ad agency managers don't catch very many mistakes before letting their clients view the page.  So I found myself referring back to Krug's book to see how best to approach testing.  As it turned out our work team, and some family members, caught the majority of the mistakes and folks were very happy with the final product. Another thing to watch out for is that Krug is giving advice based on what works best for the user of web page sites.  Some of his advice is contrary to what I've experienced in my professional life in regards to search engine optimization.  Krug says to cut out extraneous and unneeded text which is all fine and good for your web page readers, but will not get your page optimized (when a person types in keywords to yahoo or google...your page hitting the top of the search results list).

B00000JNJ1|4.0|The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because I share the same feelings that the band had toward Rod. At this same time he had awesome SOLO albums coming out. Can you imagine the Faces with Rods full creative attention? Oh well, whatever, its still great stuff lots of fun and I can still remember the concerts. Faces were the ultimate live band that would party along with you. Those of you that were fortunate enough to see them live will really appreciate this.
0618477942|4.0|This book is not a fun read.  It can entertain, but for me it brought up those covert creepy memories of growing up with a family.  I resonated with this book.  It has depth.  It's philisophical and personal.  It's tragic mostly because of the dissonance each parent has with who they are and who their kids are.  Weird as life.  Thank you for putting into pictures and words what are the things many of us have trapped in our psyches.  Brilliant!!!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|The rugged looking Daniel Craig gives a fresh approach to the James Bond character since Sean Connery relinquished the role.  With an ambivalent attitude to danger and no hesitation to immerse himself into peril, Craig plays a seminal version of Bond, recently bestowed with a license to kill.<br /><br />Not fully trusted by his superior M played by the stern Judi Dench, he globe trots in a mission to upend the organization of the villain Le Chiffre played by Danish actor Mads Mikkelson.  Le Chiffre is the banker to a worldwide network of terrorists.  Craig thwarts a Chiffre sponsored act of terrorism costing him millions.  This leads to Craig's inclusion in a super high stakes game of Texas Hold Em in Montenegro's Casino Royale as Le Chiffre tries to recoup his losses with the $150 million first prize.  Craig is fronted the money under the supervision of MI6 sponsored accountant Vesper Lynd played by Eva Green, who will become his love interest.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" typically has an abundance of death defying action sequences replete with dangerous and acrophilic stunts.  Filmed in many exotic locations the film is a worthy representative of the James Bond series.  Unlike his pretty boy predecessors Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan, Craig creates a more appealing character who not only takes his lumps but unthinkably actually falls in love.
0689878451|5.0|I am a kindergarten teacher and I find this book to be an excellent way to demonstrate \\"alternative\\" kinds of love.  It's not \\"political\\"  although it has been controversial.  It's a true story about 2 male penguins who become close companions and who nurture and egg and baby penguin together.  It didn't shock my students.  They take life how it is and recognise love and goodness.  I highly recommend this book for every elementary class!
0743298020|4.0|When I was about 100 pages in, I was ready to give this book 5 stars since I could not put it down and was completely engrossed in it. However, towards the end, I felt let down by the 'surprise' ending. My enthusiasm definitely dulled in the last 50 pages. Nevertheless, I encourage anyone to give this book a go, as the first half is so brilliantly written, it's pure joy to read.

Madonna sounds absolutely amazing on this tour!!! \\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\" is Madonna's first live album. You can also get her second live album \\"The Confessions Tour: Live From London\\" CD/DVD combo! MADONNA RULES!!!
B000A59PMO|5.0|I just recently watched the first show on DVD after hearing about and reading such good reviews about it. I had heard that it was the new Buffy, pretty good analogy. I can't figure out why I have missed out on this show for the past 2 and 1/2 years. It has to be the time slot that it is in. Now I hear that it is jeopardy of being cancelled. How can shows this great be cancelled so prematurely when garbage continues to make it on the other networks. If the CW wants to make it, they need to wake up and start promoting some of the excellent shows they have. Veronica needs to be moved, possibly pairing it up with Smallville would be a great move. This show needs to be saved, it is one of the best written and witty shows I have watched in a long time. The first season blew me away, I am 37 years old and I can tell you this show is not just for the younger crowd. I will be purchasing season 2 soon to start on the 2nd season, I am dying to see who was at her door on season 1 finale, it had to be duncan?? Please, if you have not seen, take the time to do so, you will be hooked.

Here is what it comes down to: if you are mainly left brain competent and you do not distinguish yourself from your competition, your present and future clients and customers will treat you like a commodity and make their decisions to use or not use you based on price rather than value.  Daniel Pink's book is a way to tell you to \\"wake up and smell the future\\" which belongs to those that can relate deeply to and with people. So get your interpersonal skills spiffed up or be relegated to the outsource heap. A great resource to help you with that is Keith Ferrazzi's book, \\"Never Eat Alone.\\"  And trust me, it you rely solely on your technical expertise to make it to retirement, you WILL be eating alone and without a job.
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|Gary Bertini's EMI Mahler cycle is more or less contemporary with Tennstedt's Mahler cycle on the same label. But, according to the gossip, the company decided to keep Bertini in the vaults since the former and LPO where more publicly known. In my view, however, Bertini's set is clearly superior. The orchestra - K&ouml;lner Rundfunk Sinfonieorchester - is outstanding, far better than LPO, and so are most of Bertini's interpretations as well.<br /><br />Considering that Bertini and the orchestra are not among the obvious \\"stars\\", it is an exceptional sleeper. In fact, Bertini was virtually unknown before this cycle made him famous, post mortem.<br /><br />The cycle combines both live and studio recordings. The live ones were recorded in Japan where the audience knows how to behave. Excellent stereo sound adds to the pleasure.<br /><br />But one could note that some of Bertini's tempi are among the slowest on record. The final movement of symphony no. 9 stops at 28:34, which is ten minutes more than Walter's 1939 classic. It's even a few seconds slower than Chailly's very slow account on Decca. The finale of the third is six minutes longer than Tennstedt's on EMI. But the adagietto in the fifth stops at just above 10 minutes, so Bertini is not consistently very slow when Mahler's music may invite sentimental conductors to drag. Unlike such conductors, however, Bertini has the ability to keep tension during a long breath, bringing forth interesting details in contextual balance.<br /><br />Thus the performances of symphonies 1, 5, 7, 8, 9 and Das Lied von der Erde are outstanding, challenging almost every recording in the current catalogue. The remaining symphonies are also convincingly presented, in perfectly consistent performances.<br /><br />However, one irritating thing with this set is that the fourth symphony is divided over two discs. That EMI decision was not necessary. The cycle could still fit on 11 CDs with a different editing. The policy for all record companies should be to avoid unnecessary splitting.<br /><br />At a super-bargain price, this is of course the first choice among boxed sets, especially the contemporary ones. All the recordings in this box have something that attracts repeated listening. This is true of Gielen's outstanding cycle too (H&auml;nssler), but it requires you to pay four times the price. Still, Kubelik (DG) remains my favourite cycle. But Bertini's is better recorded.<br /><br />Warmly recommended!itting.

B00005JPLU|4.0|This film has all the pleasures - but all the limitations - of a skillful comic book. The astonishing graphics resemble by design those in the original picture novel, and much of the gripping battlefield action -spears hurtling, blood spurting, heads being lopped off - is also retained. It's important, I'd argue, to evaluate a film in the spirit in which it was conceived, in this case history as filtered through the somewhat distorting lens of an action (graphic) novel. Consequently, the fact that elephants and a rhinoceros were not present at the actual battle of Thermopylae(as some critics have bemoaned), nor that Xerxes himself was a more formidable opponent than a muscular, but heavily bejewelled go-go boy should be noted, even though they do not seriously undermine the film, which isn't setting out to be literal history. More to the point, and the movies' credit, is its central insistence that the Greeks were defending a sort of democracy against a Persian tyranny, a view which does ring historically true. Also, the exchange between the King of Sparta and one of his dying soldiers (\\"It was a honor to fight alongside such a King as you\\" answered by \\"It was an honor to fight alongside a Spartan like you\\"), whether historical or not, impresses with its undeniable nobility of spirit, just like those grand and witty lines from Herodotus the film does include. <br /> <br />If the film has flaws, I'd say they reside, first of all, in the too simple hero/villain opposition that fits a comic book more than a realistic historical account.  Any Spartan limitations are largely discounted as a consequence. Further, the film does get into some tedious family values and feminist stuff that seem out of place for the time. Shifts from the battlefield back to Sparta to include these have mostly the boring intrusiveness of those \\"meanwhile, back at the ranch\\" sequences that used to disfigure westerns. Also, the dialogue sometimes veers between almost contemporary street slang ( wording pretty close to \\"I've got your back\\") coupled with highly inverted sentences that sound pseudo-Shakespearean. <br /> <br />But, again, these are flaws easily tolerable when taken in conjunction with the film's undeniable excitement, memorable graphics, and moments of genuine nobility.
B000FVGMC4|4.0|The only reason I didn't give Paola Nutini five stars is that I wish there were just a few more up-tempo numbers.  Don't get me wrong, all of the songs on this CD are very good, it's just that I like songs that make me want to move more than I like songs that move me.  Nutini has a great voice and a nice way with a tune.  How good will he be in five years?
B000ICL3KG|5.0|With 800 Amazon reviews (or so) and counting, I don't think there's much (if anything) I can say about this DVD that hasn't already been said.  I can, however, write about the impact this film has had on myself and my family (which is something I don't think too many of the other 800 reviewers know).  So here goes:<br /><br />I saw this film initially in the theater, more out of a sense of duty and obligation (my mom wanted to go) than a sense of imminent entertainment.  I mean, I didn't exactly mind Al Gore going in, but I didn't necessarily consider him to be the most compelling figure the world (let alone the movie world) had to offer.  But the movie, surprisingly, had me captured and enraptured, and Al Gore was actually engaging and, dare I say, entertaining.  What happened to the old, stiff and dull Al Bore I once knew and felt so apathetic about?  Apparently, greenhouse gasses have not only warmed up the globe but have warmed up old Al as well.  Nice to see.<br /><br />At the closing credits, everybody applauded and filed out to their SUV's.  My mom actually made a cell phone call with her car idling in the parking lot, so I guess the projected satellite shots of her Florida beach house being inundated by the ocean didn't affect her as much as I would have thought.  But I immediately went home and logged on to the movie's website (listed in the closing credits) and have been following its steps to reduce my \\"carbon footprint\\" ever since.  Plus I bought a copy of this DVD to lend out to family members (who didn't feel as obligated as I did to accompany Mom to this movie, apparently). And their reactions have been even more striking:<br /><br />My usually materialistic-at-any-cost sister was very moved and is now acting more to preserve a better world for her son than to fulfill her every consumer comfort need.  And my brother-in-law, even more shockingly, was affected too; being a germophobe, he was horrified to see the effect atmospheric warming has on the creation/incubation of newer forms of various microscopic bio-nasties (note: this is not the technical term, I don't believe).<br /><br />Suffice it to say, this movie is surprisingly entertaining and actually can move skeptical people to make some positive changes in their daily lives.  My zany family is living proof of that!he creation/incubation of newer forms of various microscopic bio-nasties (note: this is not the technical term, I don't believe). <br /> <br />Suffice it to say, this movie is surprisingly entertaining and actually can move skeptical people to make some positive changes in their daily lives.

0743496728|5.0|I was anxiously awaiting this book and found it to be compelling reading.  I have a son who was bullied and could relate to the effects of it.  Jodi Picoult once again delves into personalities and makes her characters realistic.  I kept waiting for trite \\"fixes\\" within the plot, but Picoult didn't take the easy way out.  Another story that makes you think... A great book by a great author. Already can't wait for the next one.
B00026WU82|5.0|The best and most important Rock and Roll album ever? Yeah, definitely.  Blonde on Blonde may have come after, but for me this album was always a distillation of Blonde on Blonde...other people see that album as filling out the ideas on Highway 61, but to me it's just the opposite. I've owned one LP, 2 cassettes and am now on my second CD of this album. Buy it, steal it,...but definitely get it.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I wonder if George Lucas could be breaching the trade description act? Here we have a DVD being sold largely on the strength of it being the 'original' theatrical version released in 1977. Yet, for those of us old enough to remember the original, one very special scene from the original has been deleted, the meeting between Han Solo and Jabba the Hut in Mos Eisley, where Jabba is a human, (hence Han Solos comment as he boards the Falcon). It was this scene in particular which for me highlighted one of the huge changes between the original and the later version. So, come on George, why did you delete it? And why did you then have the audacity to market it as the 'original'? <br />Certainly, I must have a different version of the DVD to B. Abraham as he gives the distinct impression that this scene is in his version of the 'original'. Otherwise it is how I remembered. The one star is for the unacceptable deletion of the Jabba scene, which had it been left in would have been a great piece of nostalgia, and for film enthusiasts would have helped show how the franchise developed over the years.   <br />
B0006AAS5G|5.0|When I ordered this watch I was expecting to get exactly what I paid for....a $95 watch, but what I received far surpassed my expectations.  First, the box it came in was ginormous and well protected.  Seriously you could have fit 3 or 4 of these watches in that thing, and it included a suede or suede-like polishing cloth as well.  The watch itself was covered in a clear protective film which was easily removed.  Upon inspection the first thing I noticed was the face and how it has a very detailed raised background which adds a lot of class to the watch.  An additional nice feature is the screw down crown which allows you to &#34;lock&#34; down the dials without worrying about water getting into the watch through the adjustment shafts.  Invicta didn't overlook the details here, and it shows.  A quick review of the included guide and I had the second hand adjusted to the 12 o'clock position and it was ready to go.  I did have to remove a few links to get it to the proper size, but it was a straightforward process even without the proper tool.  If you are unsure how this process works or are nervous that you might scratch the watch, you can purchase a pin removal tool right here on Amazon for about $15 which would surely make the job much easier.    A week later and it hasn't lost any measurable amount of time, so it appears that it is doing exactly what it was designed to do.  This watch does use a Japanese movement (indicated by the micro-printing on the face which reads &#34;Japan Movt&#34; at the 6 o'clock position), but the modern Japanese movements are on par with anything the Swiss can make, and in some cases are arguably better - although they don't carry the same veneration as being able to say you have a &#34;Swiss watch&#34;.  Admittedly the second hand isn't as smooth as a $3500 watch and it doesn't &#34;sweep&#34; like a Rolex....but honestly what do you expect for around $100?  I'm guessing about 99% of the average citizen would have no clue if this wasa $100 watch or a $3500 watch - and I'm not about to spend a few extra thousand just to have the name Rolex glued to the face.  They both tell time, only this one comes with the added feature of a fat wallet as well.  The stopwatch function is nice, but honestly isn't that valuable.  It might be neat to watch the second hand swing back up to 12 when you reset it, but with the exception of testing a speedometer I doubt it would be precise enough for much else.  I won't use any of the chronograph functions, but again I believe they add a touch of class to the watch and make it look much more expensive than it is.  The fit and finish as extremely good, and even though I have worn it every day since it arrived and haven't exactly been gentle thus far there isn't a scratch to be found anywhere on the face or even the band.  The clasp itself is more of a brushed stainless material which is appreciated since it is the part which comes into contact with hard surfaces most often, and it should be somewhat resistant to scratching.  If I have any complaints at all it would be the embossed &#34;INVICTA&#34; found on the 9 o'clock side of the watch.  It isn't that noticeable when worn, but it seems a little representative of a Seiko or Timex....could have done without it.  The Invicta logo on the face is very tasteful and well done - not distracting from the rest of the face at all.  All things considered I wouldn't hesitate for a second to purchase another Invicta, and assuming this watch stands up to my usage over the next year or two I most likely will add to my collection.  This particular model is nice enough to be worn in a business or formal event but also can be worn with jeans and t-shirts.  The watch itself is a little beefier than what I was coming from, but it hasn't bothered me thus far and even though I have smaller wrists I don't believe it looks too big.  However, if you are looking for more of a streamlined timepiece or something which is thin - you won't appreciate the bulkiness of a chronograph or this model in particular.  Update 11/01/10:  Over three and a half years later and I am still very happy with this watch.  I wear the watch every day and have had no significant issues thus far.  I did break a pin which resulted in me losing one of the end links on the band (my fault), but I ordered a replacement band from Amazon which solved the issue (I wrote a separate review for that as well).  About a month ago I noticed the second hand on the watch stopped working but the hour and minute hands were still working just fine.  I thought the watch was broken, but aside from the second hand everything else seemed ok so I continued to wear it.  About a week or ten days later the entire watch stopped, so I replaced the battery and all is well again (including the second hand).  The next time I notice the second hand stop, I'll consider it a warning that the battery is about to die on me.  I am considering buying another watch in black, and I'm am putting Invicta at the top of my list due to the way this watch has performed.  The only thing I would change about this watch would be to swap out the battery for a self-winding movement, but for under a hundred bucks that is asking for quite a bit.  I know Invicta has self-winding watches that cost a bit more, so I might opt for one of those in the future.  03/11/2016:  Time (pardon the pun) for another update!  This watch still works like a champ although I have gone through a few batteries since my purchase.  Everything continues to work as it should and the watch still tells perfect time.  This has been such a good watch that I'm now the owner of two other Invicta watches.  Both of my others are nearly identical to this one, but one has a blue face and the other has a red face... so I guess I can pick whichever I'm in the mood for.  They all three have held up beautifully and I have no complaints.  I really can't say enough good things about Invicta or this watch in particular.  Ifyou like the look of a chronograph and the clean styling of this one in particular, I know you'll like it even more when you see it in person.  Would a random person on the Internet ever lead you astray?
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|I had never heard of the group but kept hearing about them and was curious. I picked up Ta-Dah! and at first listen was laughing because this was reminiscent of the bad 70's disco crap I grew up with.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Yeah, I know. Sean Connery is the best James Bond. If that's true then Daniel Craig is a very close second in this remake of Casino Royale. This \\"remake\\" is much better (a thousand times better) than the silly original done in the mid 1960s. This time, Daniel Craig (who plays Bond) is a young 00 agent earning his title. He then finds himself involved in a complex situation with a wealthy weapons dealer and the stakes are high. <br /> <br />The movie is better than any Bond movie I have seen since Connery's early stuff. The silly/impossible gadgets are no more (i.e. the silly invisible car in the last Bond movie) and Bond is now realistic and real. He has his own psychological issues he has to deal with and the plot, the plot twists and the action are outstanding.  <br /> <br />I've watched the DVD twice and I think it's the best Bond movie ever. The plot, the dialogue, the acting have finally returned James Bond to top notch entertainment.
B000MV9026|5.0|It is amazing what we can do with computer animation! Don't miss out on this visually stunning, wonderfully cute, and awe-inspiring musical romp! \\"Happy Feet\\" won an Academy Award for best animated movie, and after seeing it I think most people will whole-heartedly agree.<br /><br />Quick Synopsis: Mumble is a penguin born into a society (of penguins anyway) where singing is everything. Without your \\"heart-song\\", you can't find a mate and fall in love. Unfortunately, Mumble was born without a great singing voice, and is immediately criticized and ostrasized for his lack of singing ability. However, Mumble can do something none of the other penguins can -- he can dance! Mumble can never resist moving his happy feet to the rythmn of the other penguin's singing. Unfortunately, Mumble's fellow penguins are in danger of starvation due to a sudden lack of fish. After making a few new friends, Mumble sets out to find the reason for the disappearance of all the fish, and put a stop to it, tapping his toes and touching the lives of everyone around him on the way.<br /><br />The thing that will strike you the most about this film is the amazing musical score. The songs are fun and beautiful at the same time, but one of the best things about them are that most of them are re-tooled variations of popular hip-hop and pop songs that will help a younger generation to connect with the film. The big musical numbers are intricate and often touching.<br /><br />This is a great family film, and I think that people of all ages will be able to watch it and be entertained. It kind of has a little something for everyone -- lot's of humor, incredible musical and dance numbers (yes, penguins dancing is unbelievably adorable), even a subtle political commentary on the nature of human impact on our environment, especially the impact our actions have on animal species. Meanwhile, there are also connotations of love and acceptance, as well as youth's journey towards finding themselves and growing to be happy with who they are and not who others think they should be. These are all positive messages that are cleverly tucked into the plot, inbetween fantastical dance numbers, and wise-cracking penguins.<br /><br />Bottom line, this was a very enjoyable film for me. Admittedly I'm a big fan of these types of family films, but all the same I think that others will enjoy it also.growing to be happy with who they are and not who others think they should be.

And only the Widow has lines like \\"Don't you take that away from him!\\" and \\"You best call me Sarah.\\"  <br />  <br />* Alas, the Widow also has to get kidnapped by a particularly ShadowyType who likes to lick her face and whisper \\"There's your boy!\\" <br />  <br />* Let's do a quick review of a homemade weaponry featured in \\"Shooter\\": An IV made out of a turkey baster. A silencer made out of a water bottle and a sponge. A machine out of \\"Saw\\" that forces a guy to shoot himself in the head. A rifle that shoots by remote. Pipe bombs. Napalm. Yes, homemade napalm. And a truck that travels from Virginia to Montana in a matter of 12 hours. <br />  <br />* Ned Beatty is the Corrupt Senator. Beatty, mourning the fact that he played a great role just like this 30 years ago in \\"Network,\\" belches absurd lines here like \\"There are haves, and have nots!\\" <br />  <br />* There's an Apocalyptic Old Man in \\"Shooter,\\" too. You know the guy. He was here before time yet was and will remain until the Rapture to expense bizarre wisdom in his house in the woods. In \\"Shooter,\\" Old Man knows guns inside and out, and where all the world's best snipers are hidden. <br />  <br />* Because the movie never explains it, you should know that Ethiopia and Eritrea are two different countries. Do you notice how action movies use geography like \\"ER\\" uses medical terminology? Like this: BotchedopsecafterroutingEritreannationals. <br />  <br />* The movie ends three times, kills about 100 people, blows a bishop's head off, and ends on this classic image: A vintage Camaro, driving down the middle of a two-lane highway. Yep - straddling the center line.  <br /> <br />To be perfectly honest, if Timothy McVeigh penned a script in hell, sent it through the devil's Floo Network to John Allen Muhammad, who pitched it to Hollywood brass during visiting hours, it'd look and sound a lot like \\"Shooter.\\" It gives turkeys a bad name. <br /> <br />
B000K4WLXA|5.0|A great movie that any game of the game will love.  Even if you haven't played the game, the extras on the dvd will give you enough of the backstory to help you keep up.  Stunning visuals, great story, great action, and heart.  This is one movie that any fan of final fantasy or anime should not miss.
B00005JPLU|1.0|By this point, every man, woman, frat guy, dorm dweller, athlete, pothead, goofball, wordsmith, dancer, cook, dog-catcher, comic book collector, aspiring heart surgeon, sous chef, Greaser, Soc, sailor, sandman, action junkie and sneaky 13-year-old who really wanted to see \\"300\\" has seen it.      So there's no point in rehashing it or even specifically reviewing it. The movie, directed by Zack Snyder and employing a visual look inspired by Peter Jackson and graphic artist  Frank Miller, is a phenomenon. Like \\"The Matrix\\" - which is far superior - it recalibrates Hollywood.      Sure, comic book movies have scored since the original \\"Superman.\\" But \\"300\\" doesn't have a minted pedigree. No iconic heroes. And no titanic actors in it. The cloth from which it's cut might be absurd and remarkably unaware, but it's immensely attractive.    Snyder and Co. splash every color of blood puddin' they could find on the screen, and the result, to me, is nothing less than right-wing propaganda. Maybe even Nazi propaganda. It's certainly Ayn Rand's wet dream.       Hyperbole? Nope. Just \\"300.\\"     It opens on a piles of skulls beneath a cliff. A narrator tells us those are the miniature skulls of babies tossed to their death for any physical imperfection. Fortunately for baby Leonidas, who will one day be king of Sparta, he is without flaw, and is spared from murder.     His physical perfection especially helps when he is trained to kill and thrown into the wilderness at 7. Later, when Leonidas leads his titular men against the giant Persian army  in the name of freedom, we must remember the \\"liberty\\" for which he fights is really the tyranny of the pure.      It's the Spartan, who embraces a beautiful death, against the defiled, deranged Persian, who toils as a slave. The leader of the Persian army is Xerxes, an eight-foot cross of Gandhi and belly dancer. Most of his soldiers resemble Orcs. Some are magicians. A couple are deformed monsters At one point, frustrated, they simply usetheir lone rhinoceros against this band of sculpted, sepia-toned Greek gods.     It's arrogant and faithless to presume audiences will set aside the substance of the Spartans -they're unlikable, smarmy, racist and homophobic and firmly reject the idea of diplomacy - to embrace the movie's dramatic images. Breathtaking as they might be, they remain in celebration of something our conscience rejects. To demand the film remains in the vacuum of entertainment reduces the viewer to Alex in \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"    And the final act of \\"300\\" feels like a cross between an MTV video and a high schooler's poorly penned allegory that he turns into the creative writing teacher after sealing the document with a tear of integrity, solemnly closed eyes and a symbolic kiss. It's total cheese and out of character with what we know of Leonidas throughout the movie.    It amounts to a beefcake weepier. Goofy, Harlequin-style idolatry. Of course it's absurd, but it doesn't mean it's not a little irresponsible when it eventually reduces every female character to a set of breasts and flowing locks. It doesn't mean we have to let it off the hook.    We may want to disassociate meaning from images, to turn them into a mechanical series of ones of zeroes, but we can't, and we don't, so embracing \\"300\\" for being cool is akin to embracing \\"Birth of a Nation\\" for its revolutionary filmmaking while it tacitly supported the Ku Klux Klan. Fanboys need to get a brain. Zack Snyder needs to get a clue.

B000E1155E|3.0|So it's February 2005 and I get an email from a great friend...\\"The best band in Britain is unsigned, I've sent you a copy of the CD the band gave a friend of a friend after one of their gigs...\\"<br /><br />The CD duly arrives and I don't listen to it. It's not so much that no-one tells me who The Best Band In Britain is, I just don't fancy it at that time.<br /><br />Eventually the emails from my friend begin to pile up: \\"what do you think of it?\\", \\"It's great isn't it?\\", \\"Matt's obsessed with it\\" etc so I crack and give it a listen.<br /><br />Well...the opening track is 'A Certain Romance' and is the most exciting thing played on guitars since, well, The Libertines and yes, it does kind of sound like The Libertines at the start, right after the initial Ocean Colour Scene opening but then it takes off into its own little world and gets really interesting...\\"Well they might wear classic Reebok or knackered Converse or tracky bottoms tucked in socks but all of that's what the point is not the points that there int no romance around there...\\"...Every line of this song rings true and is either funny (\\"There's only music so that there's new ringtones\\") or makes you angry remembering the people in every pub round here you go in that are like that. The next song was 'Bigger Boys And Stolen Sweethearts' and by the time I'd gone through all 16 tracks I was convinced, one, of how great this band were (these were unreleased demos for crying out loud!) and how, two, they were going to be massive.<br /><br />And so we move on to this, the debut album itself...<br /><br />Where I start to question myself.<br /><br />'A Certain Romance' is up there with the best in any The Greatest Opening Song To A Debut Album list and yet it's buried at the back here, as the last song (or as another friend put it, \\"That's never a final track on an album...\\")and the actual opening is 'The View From The Afternoon' which is just okay as a song. Or rather as an opening song on this album...<br /><br />I understand the whole 'Saturday Night And Sunday Morning' theme (the album takes its title from one of Arthur Seaton's rants/monologues in the novel) and the way the album is accordingly split into two to tell its story with 'A Certain Romance' at the end -seperate- as an overview is perfect in that regard and works as a concept but the album suffers as a whole as a listening experience as a result. Which is a shame. (Why couldn't they have started with the all-encompassing overview and then moved onto the specific? It might have made a massive difference...) I like 'The View From The Afternoon', i really do, just not in the context of this album.<br /><br />Enough. Why not talk about the songs?<br /><br />'I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor' you will know and I like the way it mirrors the anticipation of a night out on the lash, all anthemic and crucially looking forward in expectation but at the same time very knowing in that regard (There ain't no Montagues or Capulets/Just banging tunes and DJ sets...\\"). 'Fake Tales Of San Francisco' is great too - the pretensions of the local band in your local pub laid bare (\\"You're not from New York City you're from Rotherham...\\"). Unless you actually live in New York City, I suppose.<br /><br />If a lot of this is great then why only 3 stars? (It's 3 and a half actually but you can't reflect that)<br /><br />Well, because the bad songs soon pile up too is maybe the answer. 'You Probably Couldn't See...' is none too good and indicative of the disappointment of the album as a whole for me: obvious guitars just chugging along until obvious repetitions occur. 'Still Take you Home' is of the same kind - simplistic riffs that are repeated - until you get drawn into the lyrics (again) and the feel of the song and then you get the unexpected jewel, that soulful wooah wooah wooah and part of you wants to forgive the band anything.<br /><br />'Riot Van' is the second greatest song and maybe shows the way forward, (\\"Got a chase last night/From men with truncheons dressed in hats...\\"), a quiet subtlety to the hazy backdrop of late Saturday night and early Sunday morning normality. \\" 'Have you been drinking, son? You don't look old enough to me?'/'I'm sorry, officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be?'\\". Yes, brilliant. But then the song just stops, it doesn't seem finished...<br /><br />And I'm back to thinking about the album as a whole. And maybe still trying to pinpoint why I have the reaction I do...ay forward, (\\"Got a chase last night/From men with truncheons dressed in hats...\\"), a quiet subtlety to the hazy backdrop of late Saturday night and early Sunday morning normality. \\" 'Have you been drinking, son?

Enjoy it and live it and we can change the world!!
0671646788|1.0|The book is plain boring and outdated for my taste. The message is clear but it is a message based on blind faith rather than on actual analisys of facts.

B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Incubus is one of the top rock bands of the last 10 years!  This album will not disappoint.  It already has 3 songs on the radio and I'm predicting that 'oil and water' and track 11 will shortly follow.  This band has such a great sound that every new album seems to be just as good as the last.  Buy It!
B00004RHZU|4.0|This album builds on lessons learned from Pink's first release \\"Misunderstood\\".  It has some more polish and finese, but still maintains that hard edged \\"I'm gonna tell it like it is\\" style that makes Pink, Pink.  I really love her bold confidence and pure scrappy attitude.  She is a good performer and has a strong sultry voice.  I am collecting her work in reverse order starting with \\"Try This\\" and finding the early albums great glimpses of what was to come later in her career.  She is a strong person and will be around for a long time. <br />Go Girl! You kick major A## Pink !
B00005LANG|5.0|I was living on the island of St. Thomas in 1977 when I first heard this recording. I was on a beautiful beach, drinking those powerful rum punch drinks. Someone played the first song, \\"Natural Mystic\\" and for me, it was like being transported to another time dimension. The musical cadence and beauty of the song just captured me. I was instantly hooked to Bob Marley's music. The entire album has a quality to it that has made it one of the true classics in music. Not one bad track on the entire set. Played with passion and love by one of the greats, the main \\"rude boy\\" himself, Robert \\"Bob\\" Marley.
B00005RFAI|4.0|This is Pink's first album to my knowledge.  It has some raw studio tape footage that is cute and rough.  I loved it.  The segments give a good hint of what this ballsy little girl is about, and a preview of the bold, strong woman she became.  She has fun with this release and you get to hear it.  It is cool to listen to the inside track banter between Pink and the recording engineer.  She is a force to be reckoned with; and a sweet lady all in one.

B000K7VHQ4|3.0|After having seen movies like FX (aka FX Murder by Illusion) way back in 1986 where the main character a Special FX guy uses his skill to get his revenge and later the move \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" (1994) for the type of screenplay for revenge and eventual victory for the main character in the end, the scenes in \\"The Illusionist\\" were only any-one's-guess.<br /><br />Furthermore the movie could have been a winner had it been based on a real life character but it isn't. Instead it is based on a book.<br /><br />With the special effects of today who cannot create a better illusionist? Here is the difference between a movie on an escape artist such as  Houdini who actually lived and performed incredible feats than one whom someone can conjure and then conjure feats attributed to him. And naturally with all such illusory powers what is that you cannot get? Simply anything in a movie as this. That's the biggest flaw of the film.<br /><br />However the film has its pluses. They are the sepia tone, lovely  cinematography (deserving of the Oscar nomination) and a beautifully and softly paced narrative.<br /><br />Without the french beard Edward Norton would not have fitted into the role. Paul Giamati as the police officer does a neat role stealing presence from Edward Norton. Rufus Sewell as Leopold also deserves mention.<br /><br />Three stars is a big score for this movie. Check out \\"The Prestige\\" if you are into movies of this kind.
0596009208|5.0|This is my second Head First Book that I have finished, my first was [[ASIN:059610197X Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML (Head First)]]. This book is a much more dense book compared to the HTML one, which makes since due to the fact that OOP is a much much more deep a topic than HTML & CSS. <br />I took my time reading this book and have read each chapter at least twice to reinforce all the concepts, and have placed tabs on pages that I reference frequently. <br /> <br />The first half of the book goes over proper Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and really tries to reinforce how to think about Objects. The second half of the book goes over using common classes already in the Java Runtime so you learn not just how to do OOP but also so you learn how to use and discover new classes. <br /> <br />I also think that the concepts taught in this book will help you regardless of what programming language you use. I recently earned my degree in Management Information Systems. I have taken many programming classes (VB.NET, C++) and none of them taught OOP as well as this book. HF Java has taught me proper OOP which has really helped my in my new job in which I use VB&ASP.NET. <br /> <br />As for my review all I can do is add to the deafening chorus of all the other reviews and proclaim that this is indeed a fantastic book! <br /> <br />Now I'm off to go read [[ASIN:0596008678 Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design: A Brain Friendly Guide to OOA&D (Head First)]] and then probably [[ASIN:0596007124 Head First Design Patterns (Head First)]]!
B000M341QE|5.0|Departed is a classic good-guys and bad-guys thriller.  However, you are kept guessing as to the ending.  Lots of blood, but the story remains very true to the Hong Kong original.  The rooftop scenes in the original are much better than in Departed, but DiCaprio, Wahlberg and Damon are all fantastic.
1582701709|5.0|This work contains infomation that is true on many levels.  If you are unfamiliar, \\"The Secret\\" simply states that you bring into your life that which you focus your attention upon.  If you focus continually upon the negative, your life will express that; and likewise with the positive.   <br /> <br />On the upside:  both the DVD and CD/book (although the CD and book do a more thorough job)give the listener/reader all of the \\"how to\\"s regarding manifesting desire through attention.  Generally, it is very pragmatic, focusing on practical application rather than abstruse theory. For those with a mystical or metaphysical world-view, you will find much to supliment your own religion, whether you are Christian, Wiccan, Muslim, Gnostic, Buddhist, or other. <br /> <br />On the downside:  for those unfamiliar with New Thought, The Secret may lead one to believe that you can get things \\"OUT THERE\\".  Although the Author and the contributors clearly understand that the focus must be internal, the uninitiated may come to believe that they can win THAT SPECIFIC THING; while the teaching really says that one simply allows one's self to become a center of expression for the universe. <br /> <br />If you are a person who is interested in The Western Tradition or New Thought, you will likely find this to be a direct and effective distilation of what you have already been taught. <br /> <br />If your views are very orthidox, you will likely not approve of this item.  Please don't bring hatred to this item and prothelitize about satanism and hate... in this case, you'd simply be in the wrong.
B000001DQI|5.0|Oh my goodness!  \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" should have 10+ STARS! I remember when this came out when I was in junior high school.  My favorites are \\"Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" \\"Candle In The Wind\\", \\"Saturday Night's Allright For Fighting\\" and most definitely the one that I love the most is \\"Bennie & The Jets\\". Out of all the music Elton Hercules John (correction:) Sir Elton Hercules John has made, this is my favorite and a must for all his fans.  I still have the \\"LP\\" version. I remember when he was on \\"Soul Train\\" on May 24, 1975 and sang <br />\\"Philadelphia Freedom\\" and \\"Bennie & The Jets\\". He made history as the first rock artist to appear on that show and he mentioned that \\"Soul Train\\" was his favorite TV show. Sir Elton Hercules John is a legend and his music always have moved me in a way that just have me \\"high as a kite by then\\".  The Rocket Man at his best! What else can you say about Sir Elton Hercules John besides he's \\"The Rocket Man\\" who have put the music world and his fans on a jet ride for over 35 years? I don't know about you, but he has had me rockin' since I heard of him and he is the absolute <br />best and I will always love him and I'm proud to say that his music has made me very happy since the very beginning.  If you don't have \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" buy it, you won't regret it.
B0000797IO|4.0|Justine (Jennifer Aniston) is not satisfied with her life because she chose to marry and settle down at a young age instead of going to college and seeing the world. At thirty, she becomes restless and yearns for excitement, romance and whatever else she is missing that life has to offer. Enter Tom (Jake Gyllenhaal): a twenty-two year-old boy who patterns his life after books he has read, such as \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" Enamored of what dreams Tom might be able to fulfill, Justine falls for the ostensibly worldly Tom, who calls himself Holden (after Holden Caulfield). Life becomes complicated after this. Aniston was a good choice for the role of Justine because it is imperative the audience feel sympathy toward her plight as a frustrated housewife, and people love her because of her role on \\"Friends.\\" As her husband, John C. Reilly is, as usual, outstanding. His films are always worth seeking and this one is no exception. In supporting roles, Tim Blake Nelson and Zooey Deschanel provide several moments of hilarity. As Bubba, Mr. Nelson's demeanor and expressionless face belie the mischief brewing within his scheming mind. As Cheryl, Miss Deschanel has a bad attitude and the impudence that declares she could take her job or leave it. It is the light-hearted and comic tone of the film that prevents it from being better than it is. Although I really enjoy the film, it falls shy of poignancy in scenes where it is required. It could have been great, but is merely very good as it is. The DVD has some deleted scenes, commentary from cast and crew, and includes both the full-screen and widescreen versions, which earn the DVD an extra half-star.
1563523302|4.0|This book is extremely informative with regard to what it takes for one to actually be wealthy.  A lot of it seems like common sense after reading it, but the way it sums up all the facts about millionaires is very effective and useful.  It really causes the everyday  consumerist to actually think about how much money is being spent on thoroughly unecessary products.  Contrary to popular belief, many of those big spenders living in fancy nieghborhoods with nice cars aren't actually worth much. If one is interested in accumulating wealth, I highly recommend this book.
B000HEWEEY|2.0|The DVD's are fine, the postcards are an intersting touch, BUT the robot is a smaller than pictured solid rubber model with a decal face. Placed in a tin box, I would rather have spent $20 less for the DVDs alone.

B000KX0IOK|5.0|This movie is very well done.  The acting is precise, even an expression from Ryan Gosling lets you know how his character is experiencing life, whether it be he is high on drugs or inspiring his students in the inner city classroom.  Shareeka Epps portrays her character equally good.  She demonstrates the hardships of her lifestyle, which depicts the lifestyle of so many young people in the very same situation.  What I appreciate about the way the script was written is that even with her rough around the edges ways, she is still strong and willing to do the right thing under the most extreme circumstances.  Having a teacher with a drug problem is a reality of our culture that, even though you want to say that's wrong, or that wouldn't really happen, it does and she handles it responsibly and honestly.  <br />  <br />The lighting in the movie is spot-on, the story sucks you in and the settings are so believable, you feel compassion for the characters because you feel what they are feeling.   <br />  <br />I recommend watching this movie, even if it is just once. <br />
0380789035|3.0|It's obvious that Gaiman has a unique writing style that is all his own and while he is skilled and the words themselves flow comfortably, I couldn't help but spend the entirety of the book feeling bewildered and confused.  The confusing thing wasn't the writing, but rather the story itself, which was so incredibly surreal that it left my head hurting.<br /><br />Even now I sit here with a furrowed brow a little conflicted about what to tell you concerning this book.  Thus I will give you this:<br /><br /> - oddly enough the best character development surrounded the supporting cast rather than the protagonist who was flat and under-developed.  I didn't care much about his outcome.  Part of what caused me such bewilderment on this one is that he seemed to have almost no or completely inappropriate emotions about some pretty profound things that affected him within the story.  It made him seem like a cardboard cut-out.<br /><br /> - rather anti-climactic story-line overall.  The book seems to revolve around a series of events that almost happen.  That's the only way I can describe it.  It's very strange.<br /><br /> - I'm not against sexuality or language within a story in so far as it supports the story and builds characterization (my favorite books are the Song of Ice and Fire group by George R. R. Martin which belive me, have their fair share) but I felt like there was a good bit of profanity and sexuality present here simply for the sake of its presence.<br /><br /> - other than that the story was fairly well written and has a distinct style that would be well recieved if the overall plot of the book and design of the characters was more definitely fleshed out.<br /><br />In conclusion, while the author shows that he has skill and talent, his story played out in my mind with blurry edges and no definition, leaving me feeling a little drunk and bewildered.  I can't decide whether I'd recommend it or not so I give it three stars - right in the middle, which is where this story lives.which is where this story lives.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This movie is done quite well.  The acting is excellent, and you really feel what the characters are facing with the huge challenges they are presented with.  I particularly enjoyed the subplot of the nanny that goes to the wedding in Mexico.  The camera shots make you feel like you are right there with them.  The colors and lighting are beautiful and realistic.    <br />  <br />Be forewarned new mothers:  You feel like your shoulders are in a perpetual state of risen tension while watching this film.  All your worst fears about visiting foreign countries, leaving your children at home, etc all come to fruition.   <br />  <br />I like Brad Pitt, but the praise he received for this movie was overrated.  He did a good job, but not any better than the other lead actors in the other subplots of the movie did.  They were all very good. <br />  <br />

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Having already watched David Attenborough's entire BBC series Planet Earth last year on the BBC, I was somewhat looking forward to seeing this series broadcast on high definition here on the Discovery Channel today. To my horror, instead of hearing the familiar voice of Attenborough, I hear some female voice reading through the narration. After a brief search on the internet I have found out that Discovery Channel execs decided that they would change the narration for this program to Sigorney Weaver (yes, the actress who hasn't worked since the last Aliens sequel) specifically for American audiences.<br /><br />Blech!!!! WHY??? I'm sorry I set my TiVo to record anything with David Attenborough as a narrator. You can hear in his voice that he KNOWS what he is talking about. He is PASSIONATE about the subject. Sigourney Weaver is simply awful. Every line is given with the same over-dramatic, lilting, \\"I'm reading this from a script\\" voice.<br /><br />Do the execs at Discovery Channel think that Americans are so stupid that they would be confused by Attenborough's pronunciation of the word \\"zebra\\"? Or that he would say \\"from a to zed\\" instead of  \\"a to zee\\" or that he would *gasp* use the word \\"nil\\" instead of \\"zero\\"? David Attenborough practically invented the nature documentary and has been making them since the 1970s. Replacing him with a Hollywood actress is like having Michael J Fox stand in for Howard Cosell to announce boxing.<br /><br />Shame on you Discovery for cheapening this otherwise extraordinary program because you think that Americans won't understand proper English. Thankfully I have my copies of this program from last year's BBC broadcast.
B000002KKS|5.0|Heaven and Hell, I believe, is one of the greatest albums ever made. The band was heading downhill in the late 70s as drug abuse became more frequent and Ozzy was becoming a wreck. When Dio was brought in, the musical direction of the band changed. Dio brought to the band a new spark, eager to continue his thematic stuff about dungeons and dragons and good and evil like he started to do with Rainbow. Compare this album with any of Iommi's previous work and you'll see a clear change. The riffs are stronger and the solos are more melodic and meaningful. I am a fan of both Ozzy-fronted and Dio-fronted Sabbath, but this album is what comes to my mind when you say Black Sabbath. A breakdown of the tracks is as follows: <br /> <br />1. Neon Knights: It was the last song written for the album and in my opinion is frankly the best opening song on any album, period. <br /> <br />2. Children Of the Sea: The intro is very mellow and melodic and transitions into a great riff with excellent vocals. <br /> <br />3. Lady Evil: You have to love the song for the chorus. <br /> <br />4. Heaven and Hell: The title track is an absolute gem. The bassline is so simple yet so perfect for the song. The main riff is rocking and the vocals are impeccable. <br /> <br />5. Wishing Well: A great song with great lyrics. <br /> <br />6. Die Young: The intro is my favorite intro of all time. Nothing beats the synthesizers in the background and Iommi pulling a very melodic solo in the foreground. Then comes the crashing riff and Dio's thundering voice. Another gem of a song. <br /> <br />7. Walk Away: Many people hate on this song, calling it \\"pop\\" and stuff, but Dio still does a great job on the vocals and the riff is catchy. <br /> <br />8. Lonely is the Word: One of my favorite songs of all time. This is Iommi's song. It's one of the most meaningful solos I've ever heard Iommi play. He poured his heart into this one. <br /> <br />Dio's vocals are heart-pounding, Iommi's riffs are thundering, Geezer's basslines are great and Bill Ward's drumming is on point. If you are new to metal, this is a great place to start. If you are into metal and don't have this album, it is essential to your collection.
074356619X|2.0|The book is well-written.  Most people will enjoy it.  However, if you really want to know what the secret is, simply buy a book that was written in the 1950's called:  The Power of Positive Thinking.
0393051587|3.0|While the annotations are interesting I think I'd rather have them in a separate book of essays about Dickens and his world as I found them too distracting while trying to read the actual book.
B000MV9026|1.0|This movie is animated trash. The story was cliched, the voice talent's accents were insulting, the sound was substandard... and still it won an oscar. What a joke. Pixar dumped better movies in their dumpster, under their leftover spaghetti, than this one. And don't give me the \\"environmental\\" conscience, it just wasn't convincing.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|This is definitely the purest, most genre defining album ever released in hip hop. The MC work of Nas is unbelievable. His songs are well written and his clever flow and rhyming skill as well as the superb content of the songs make you emotionally connect to the tunes. Every song is ridiculously good. One of the greatest albums ever released in music bar none!
1400034779|5.0|I was given the first set of 3 books in this series and found myself right back in Africa immediately.  I could relate to the names of places in this book having been in Gaborone, Botswana a few times.  I thoroughly enjoyed the way in which the book is written and look forward to reading the last 4 books in this series about the #1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  A REALLY GOOD read.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|After seeing the movie and thoroughly enjoyng it, I went out and got a copy of Ian Fleming's original story. I must say that the mvie follows the book very well. It has had some updating, but the intensity of the mood, and the emotional complexity of the characters is there. I think Craig is a great actor, I loved \\"Layer Cake\\", \\"Sylvia\\", and his portrayel of a mentally deranged man in \\"The Jacket\\". The movie had plenty of action and gadgets to satisfy most Bond fans, but with a grittier, more pervasive side. I'm very excited for \\"Bond 22\\" next year.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|The simple fact of the matter is that Sigur Ros were introduced to the masses through their opening slot on Radiohead's Kid A tour.  Since then they've been lauded and dismissed in just about every major music magazine in the world with most opinions siding towards the former; and rightly so.   <br /> <br />For a band that's never released a song in English, it's a testament to their ability to convey emotion through music that probably 80% or more of their fans speak it as their native tongue and don't have a clue as to what Jonsi is saying, regardless if it were Icelandic or \\"Hopelandish\\".  Seeing as how Icelandic (nevermind Hopelandish, Jonsi's \\"made up\\" language) is not exactly on everyone's list of second languages you could argue that, if anything, Sigur Ros are more tied to the base principal of classical music than anything else.  How else can you explain the connection most fans associate with this band when they have absolutely no clue what is being said?  Sigur Ros could get away with entirely instrumental sets and never lose their connection with the audience (hello Haydn, Brahms etc.). <br /> <br />Sigur Ros are the quintessential example of understated elegance in a live setting and Jonsi's frequent use of the bowed guitar instantly conjures up visions of Jimmy Page in Led Zeppelin's heyday.  The band also shows creativity in their videos, visually touching on topics of homophobia to the possibility of an apocalyptic playground of the future.  'Takk...\\", the groups fourth major release, touches on just about every emotion the human psyche goes through in its lifetime, if not daily.  And nowhere on this album is that more exemplified then on the track 'Svo Hljott', an epic soundscape which conjures up images of everything from the sun rising over frost-laden grass to holding your firstborn for the first time.  That song is worth the price of admission alone, nevermind the oft-mentioned Glosoli, Saeglopur or Hoppipolla. <br /> <br />From the picturesquecountry of Iceland has come one of the 21st centuries most relevant bands, conveying more human emotion in 7 minutes than most bands do over a whole career.
B0000024U8|4.0|Of course, Kooper and Butterfield did greater work backing Dylan's recordings but this is a very interesting combo of styles.  Stills has worked with so many other musicians but his work here is worthy of praise.  Worth getting if you want something to take you back to the 60s.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|It's a must for any Rocky fan.  It's good this one came out because Rocky V sucked. <br /> <br />It's a good heart felt story.  I recommend the DVD.  I like the alternate ending better. <br /> <br />
B000I2MRHE|5.0|If they made one of these things for adults, I'd get one!!  My daughter LOVES this thing.  It's got that crinkle-sounding paper that babies seem to love, and spins really easily. The colors are really bright and everything is easily accessable for little arms and hands.  I have already told my pregnant friends that they need to get one of these!
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|The film is well paced, characters very well portrayed, Mr Rochester is intense, but not overbearing, Jane's quiet strength and will do come through. There is some CGI, not much....however, does'nt take away from the film. Overall, quite pleasing to the eye and heart. Happy to have purchased this version. I have seen three others, this by far an exciting modern depiction. Not as true to the book as the Timothy Dalton version, but very satisfying to watch...Enjoy film buffs!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Wow! This CD is very good! It is dark sounding though. I really love it! I wish it had the bonus track on there though. Because when you pre-order you'll get a bonus track. This CD is very good! They are very awesome live in concert!  <br /> <br />Evanescence rocks!!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I watched this last night on the Discovery channel and one word breathtaking.Shot over 200 locations and I mean everywhere on the face of the planet they could go.The underwater worlds that they have filmed are absolutely beautiful in themselves , but they keep on getting this powerful footage.Some footage took them years to film such as Snow Leapord on the hunt.And when I, saw the Sharks as they perform incedible acrobatic feats , I thought to myself how truly unfair hollywood has treated these beautiful creatures as mindless killing machines. <br /> <br />Panda Bears doing amazing maternal instincts and sacrifice , to emperor penguins surviving in terrible freezing temperatures and much much more. <br />This is an epic journey for the hole family and after you watch it, tell your kids that soon they will soon have the job of taking care of this beautiful planet of ours.I cannot comment much about features other then i know there is making of footage and narration with sigourney weaver and richard attenburoagh.This is a must own for you or your entire family and witness yourself the power and majesty of our planet Earth.

1582701709|1.0|Think good thoughts and you can have the world.  Bosh.  Norman Vincent Peale did a better job over 50 years ago.  I was perturbed that one fantasizing \\"good thinker\\" was relying on good thoughts and laughter (watching funny movies and videos) to cure her breast cancer--refusing any medical treatment like radiation, chemotherapy, tamoxifen.  Oprah should be castigated for using her influence to make this a best seller.  The author must be having really good thoughts now.
0446343129|5.0|I bought this book, the paperback version, because it looked very interesting and also because it was quite cheap and not too great a waste of paper and space. I bought it from the health-food co-op that I just started going to after I began my journey of live-foodism and veganism- but that's another book.  <br /> <br />I read this book in a few days and I realized how drugged our world is, and how many drugs I am now leaving out of my systems and organs- as you sow, so shall you reap.. <br /> <br />I love history so it inspired me to learn about history of all types of foods- ones I agree with as well as one's I dislike. You might even say this is my vocation now.. <br /> <br />This is a great book, and I recommend it for anyone interested in nutrition, or like eric schloesser says- \\"anyone who eats\\"

1582701709|3.0|What we have here is a case of marketing brilliance combined with schmaltzy new-age mysticism-cum-desperation.  This book does not reveal a secret. It reveals common sense. It tries to paraphrase and market for the masses the far more famous (and far more legitimate) Pareto Principal (otherwise known as the 80/20 rule). Actually, the percentages it uses are somewhat different, (96/4) but the concept is the same. Why do the majority of the people make the minority of the wealth? Why do the majority of the people experience unhappiness, etc? If you are to believe this book, it is because the minority of the people (the 4%), know \\"The Secret\\" and the other 96% don't.  Well, that might sound like a good demographic to shoot for if you are Atria Books (the publisher), but don't believe it for a second.  4% have the wealth for the same economic reasons outlined by Pareto generations ago, not because Pareto was privy to \\"The Secret.\\"   20% of your effort will result in 80% of your success.  20% of the population controls 80% of the wealth.  20% of the world is happy and 80% is not (Note: NOT the same 20% as the wealthy people!). Do the wealthy 20% know a \\"secret\\" that you don't?  No. But they do realize that 20% of their efforts result in 80% of their successes, and they act accordingly.  It's the 80% of people spinning their wheels on the 80% of non-effectiveness that are mired in their own unhappiness and economic molasses.  If it takes reading this book to point that out to you, by all means, buy it. But the following advice may be just as easy to swallow (and less expensive, and faster, too):  You cannot succeed without intention. Envision the one thing, the largest thing, that is standing between you and happiness/success. And then focus on solving that problem. Apply all your effort and intention on overcoming that obstacle. As Bruce Lee once said, \\"The warrior is the average man with laser-like focus.\\"  Focus, and then do it. Don't just read about it. That's what the 80% are doing.  - Brent Sampson, author of Self-Publishing Simplified.

B000MNP2KI|3.0|My decision to see this film was based primarily on the rave reviews it had gotten, plus the fact that one of the best screenwriters in the business (Paul Haggis) was attached.  <br /> <br />The best Bond movie ever? The best Bond ever? I suppose that depends on your point of view. If you've been looking for a more \\"Americanized\\" version of the series, and you prefer your 007 to be more in the mold of  Jason Statham (Transporter 1-2) than the classic Bond types - Connery, Brosnan and Moore - then this one's for you. Speaking of Statham, I couldn't help but think Craig had Statham in mind when he was deciding how he would play one of film's classic roles. However, although I did enjoy Craig's performance in \\"Casino,\\" I do think he's got a ways to go before he'll be ready for \\"Transporter 3.\\"  <br /> <br />As for the movie itself, I found it hard to keep track of all the individual pieces and characters, and where they fit into the main theme of the film. The movie was long, and stretched out a bit too thin; I found the story hard to follow, and it seemed, at times, to drift away from the central theme. Some viewers may find this movie confusing and hard to digest if they have a short attention span.   <br /> <br />The best part of \\"Casino\\" is the action sequence that takes place in the beginning. (I can see now why Craig was getting hurt so often during the filming). From that point on, the movie drifts along like a barge cut loose from its morings. Toward the end of the film, it began to appear as though the writers had a hard time figuring out where to call it quits; just when you think the end is near (at times I hoped it was), off it goes again in an entirely different direction.   <br /> <br />Bottom line: give me the old 007 that we've known and loved in the past. And more of that familiar soundtrack, too. Ah, Sean, Pierce and Roger -  where are you guys when we need you?
B000002LKU|5.0|This is an outstanding piece of work for Mark Knopfler as just a member of a band. It is well out of the MTV era, which to me was pathetic attempt at creating music. The supporting cast on the disc   \\"Missing...Presumed having a good time\\" is excellent. If you are looking for some MTV [....] then this disc is not for you, if you want an eclectic mix of, rock-a-billy, country, folk, and swing, then purchase this disc you will not be disappointed.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|The Illusionist was an interesting movie; good but not great. Edward Norton masters the role of Eisenheim although the screenwriters failed in one important area: Eisenheim seemed very flat, not at all a 3D character. He shows little emotion and much of the dialogue is flat and predictable. This is no fault of Norton's but of the scriptwriters. Jessica Beil in my opinion was poorly cast in this role. Her feigned English accent was awful and she just felt wrong for this role. The good parts were the beautiful cinematography, the great special effects, and the twist at the end which, while predictable, was intriging none the less. The movie had a very interesting plot. If I could change one thing it would be to explain Eisenheims powers a bit more. Was it pure illusion or did he indeed have supernatural abilities? I felt this question was not properly explored. Overall it is a good movie and an entaining way to spend a few hours.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Russell Crowe did an incredible job of portraying the real-life story of Princeton Professor John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who won the 1994 Nobel Prize, despite his dysfunction due to schizophrenia.  My heart went out to this amazing man for all he suffered; his perseverance tugged at my heart strings; and I was heartened by his wife standing beside him through thick and thin.  I'm  highly encouraged that Professor Nash managed to kick his dependence on the schizophrenia medicine and go on to reach some of his major goals in life.     Thanks to the brilliant directing of Ron Howard, A Beautiful Mind is one of those bittersweet movies with a satisfying ending that left me feeling good about life and the human conditiion ... a lasting impression of \\"hope.\\"       Russell Crowe and the entire cast are to be commended for their sensitive, caring performances in this fine drama.

B000JK8OYU|1.0|If you are a true Beatles fan, do not waste your money on this CD. It is nothing like the originals. George Martin may think he can remaster the originals but it comes out sounding terrible. It is a sin to try to work some of the greatest songs in the Beatles repetoire into combinations. Had I known this was what this CD was all about, I never would have bought it. This production was made for the Cirque du Soleil and thus was to produce a lot of money. I am beginning to find that their productions are getting too pat and this soundtrack goes along with it. In the beginning Cirque du Soleil was innovative, but like all big money-makers they go stale after a while. This album pulls the Beatle repetoire into the same cesspool. Since George Martin produced so much good Beatles music, it is sad to see him get into this cesspool too.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I listen to everything from 2pac to Metallica and have never heard such a powerful album.  Words cannot describe the pure magic that is present with these beautiful melodies.  I don't even care that I cannot translate some of them.  Its ....  <br /> <br />pick this one up.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|We are fairly fickle about our CD collection and the quality the bands must maintain. Having said that, some bands are not purchases out-of-the-gate, or on release day. For a few, like this 30 Seconds to Mars CD, they have to glean our interest from radio and video releases first.<br /><br />And wow, have they done that. Once FROM YESTERDAY came out, we knew we had to own the CD. But it was soon apparent that was only the beginning. If you are worried that the constant yelling vocals of Jared Leto may indicate an album that is \\"less than,\\" DON'T BE! From start to finish this CD has no deletable tracks - a feature that gets quite a bit of use in our household (we can clear CD tracks from the player that we do not want it to play).<br /><br />Don't waver any more if you are questioning the addition of this CD to your collection. The radio and video hits are only a hint of what is being offered, and we look forward to the next 30 Seconds to Mars release.<br /><br />I cannot really equate them to any other band, which is the most difficult part of assessing the quality of the 30 Seconds tracks. That alone should be an indicator of why this CD is a must-own.

0743289684|5.0|I first encountered Ayaan Hirsi Ali on the Tavis Smiley Show. I was intrigued by her poise and her discussion on Islam, gender politics, and human rights. After watching the show, I decided to get her book for a deeper analysis of her position.<br /><br />This is a taut and honest autobiographical portrait. It's poetic, sincere, and at times gritty. As a progressive Christian who was raised raised in the States in a Protestant home, I felt deep connections with Hirsi Ali's story. Her story is a story of struggle and the social consequences of political, gender, and racial oppression.<br /><br />In my opinion, her book is mainly about challenging the birthright of gender categories and instituting reform in Islam. According to Hirsi Ali, fundamentalist Islam, as it is practiced in many countries, contradicts Universal Human Rights because some of its practices are oppressive to women, children, and prohibits the expression of free speech, independent thought, and ultimately the livelihood of those who live in such societies.<br /><br />This is not the forum in which to debate whether she is right or wrong. However, I believe she presents an extremely strong case through her multiple accounts of war, the experience of immigrant Muslim women in Europe and through her own story of growing up in Somalia, Kenya, and Saudi Arabia.<br /><br />I commend her and her story. It's poignant and it provides a forum for discussion on religio-political societies versus secularized societies. Aside from her story, this book also investigates how fundamentalism (in any form) limits societies' infrastructures and commercial development as well as social equality. She claims that  theocratic societies, in which the oppression of women is high and is mandated by religious dogma, are \\"behind\\" other societies in terms of civic life, civil rights, and industrialization. Societies in which equality and freedom of expression are granted (more or less) tend to have more civil rights for citizens and also have more stable economies and a greater distribution of wealth among its citizens.<br /><br />For adventurous instructors, I recommend this book for courses related to Women's Studies, African and African American Studies, autobiographical narratives, globalization, and contemporary political science.<br /><br />One last comment... Regardless of your beliefs, try withholding judgment before reading her story. Her argument is for human rights and social equality through progressive social reform not radical apostasy.le economies and a greater distribution of wealth among its citizens.

B000000WJZ|5.0|This is probably the ultimate alternative rock album (rivaled closely by Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness).  It's simply flawless.  The songwriting is excellent - concise, with perfect song structure.  The guitar playing is excellent - I don't even want to think about how many overdubs were done on this album.  I do know that Soma has 40 separate guitar tracks.  This is the sound of an album that has been meticulously put together from start to finish.  It doesn't drag once over the course of it - there's not a bad song on the record.  Not only is the album perfectly constructed, it's emotionally powerful as well.  Love, hate, sadness, anger, hope, happiness, it's all there, and put across in a way that packs a punch.  The songs hold up very well over time - I've probably listened to this album a couple hundred times, and Mayonaise still gives me chills.  This is Billy Corgan's crowning achievement.

Three hours later, I won $1280 with a Royal Straight Flush. (No kidding!) Was The Secret responsible?  <br /> <br />The book reads easily and is lovely to hold, but, does The Secret work? It's made a believer out of me. <br /> <br />Of course, I still believe in the Easter Bunny.

B000BM6AVA|5.0|I saw a lot of people at school wearing shirts / hats / backpacks with the system of a down logo on them. So I listened to B.Y.O.B., and loved it. Then for some reason I ended up going with this CD even though it didn't have BYOB; sometime this past summer's when I got it. - I LOVE THIS CD -<br /><br />I now have all of System's Cds, but this is still my absolute favorite.<br /><br />Attack - 9/10 - Politically bashing lyrics, awesome guitar riffs, great high-speed song. A good introduction to the album.<br /><br />Dreaming - 9.5/10 - A really cool song. I love the music. I like the 'dreaming of screaming' part.<br /><br />Kill Rock n' Roll - 7.5/10 - Kind of a pointless song, but it's...okay, I guess.<br /><br />Hypnotize - 9/10 - I like this song a lot. It's talking about TV ads brainwashing us, and I agree.<br /><br />Stealing Society - 8.5/10 - The first half is good, but the part where they keep repeating 'looking for a mother...' is pretty bad.<br /><br />Tentative - 10/10 - My favorite song on this CD, and one of my faves by System. The chorus is depressing, but powerful \\"we're going down/in a spiral to the ground/no one's gonna save us now/not even God\\"<br /><br />U-fig - 7/10 - I don't care too much for this song.<br /><br />Holy Mountains - 10/10 - Oh yeah I love this one too!! It's so cool. it reminds me of the show Inuyasha.<br /><br />Vicinity of Obscenity - 8.5/10 - This is a pretty fun song, with a cool beat. I love the 'banana terracota pie' thing.<br /><br />Lonely Day - 8/10 - Eh, this one's alright. I don't no what possessed them to release this as a single. It's nothing like the rest of their music at all. It seems like a song that's trying to be sad and emotional, but S.O.A.D. really can't pull that off. Sorry to break it to you, guys.<br /><br />Soldier Side - 9/10 - This song is sad just because of its topic. It's about young men dying in wars and waiting for Jesus to save them. I like this song a lot, but it's a little depressing.e depressing.

B000E97X66|5.0|What?! Only five stars!  This is superb, state of the art, Rock and Roll.  Don't be a fool.  Buy this record!  Springsteen's genius is not better evident than on this masterpiece.  Live and in control, the man from New Jersey simply kicks butt, takes no names, and takes no prisoners!  From the beautiful opening with Roy Bittan on piano for \\"Thunder Road\\" to the final butt kicking thump, this is rock and roll meant to be played loud.  But don't stop here, buy the box set and get the dvd, the Born to Run album, and the making of dvd of the album.  Use this to play in your car when you are on your way to the next Bruce concert!  It simply doesn't get any better than this.

B000GG4XJM|5.0|If re-issues are going to happen, I guess this is as good of a re-issue as I could expect.  I really like the live cuts from the tour on the dvd.  Also, the added songs are wonderful.  I don't know why people carp about this, as they don't have to buy it.  There is no reason to get on to Springsteen for giving his fans what they ask for, which is why this was put together.  As for the complaint that Springsteen used non-Seeger songs so he wouldn't have to pay royalties, that is silly.  He doesn't get any more money by using traditional songs than if he had used Seeger songs.  Seeger isn't going to need the money anyway.  What Bruce did was select songs that adequately express the sentiment in our country during these troubling times.  It's another political statement, and if you don't Springsteen making political statements, don't buy his music; it's that simple.  Frankly, I'm glad that somebody has enough guts to speak up and do it in a creative way.   <br /> <br />I also bought the re-issue of Neil Young's Living With War and Bob Dylan's Modern Times.  I found the Springsteen re-issue to be a far better spendage of my money.  At least I got new stuff with Springsteen's re-issue.  The Dylan re-issue comes with videos from as far back as ten years, and only four at that.  Talk to me about rip-off.  The American Land Edition is now my standard edition of the Seeger Sessions.  I can just give the other copy to someone who might appreciate it.
B000I5Y8ZU|2.0|Simply put, MCR has never been good. They have always seemed to be reaching for the stars, but really, they're trapped in a jar reaching for the light coming through the air holes; another one of Rolling Stone's \\"Special\\" bands.  <br /> <br />Hello!?! Every band to get the slightest bit of interest gets pushed by rolling stone. It's pathetic really. Rolling stone Mag needs to be cast off its pedestal. <br /> <br />Anyways, back to MCR. The black parade starts of well enough. A slight crescendo at first which explodes into a jumble of melodies that seems to have taken them 3 seconds to think up. The CD is basically stream of consciousness from the perspective of an emotional teenager who is trying to imagine what dying would be like for him. Sad... <br /> <br />I'll put it another way that maybe some of the rock veterans can understand. Queen, some Def Leopard, maybe small influences of Led Zeppelin, and other times, vocals that seem to try and capture a Bob Dylan feel... all of these legends will be stomped under the feet of MCR right before your eyes. Sound cool? Then put your card number in and get ripped off. <br /> <br />I'm sorry to down one of your favorite bands everyone, but you like mediocrity, you got it. <br /> <br />In my opinion, if you want some serious Rock and Roll for modern times then check out a few of these bands. <br /> <br />-Dream Theater <br />-Coheed and Cambria <br />-Dragonforce <br />-Def Tones <br />-RadioHead <br />-Foo Fighters (so much better than Nirvana. Grawl really did a great job picking up where Kurt left off) <br />-Incubus <br />-Red Hot Chili Peppers <br />-Rage Against the Machine <br />-Sound and Shape (unsigned band, but amazing. Strong Zeppelin influences there) <br />-Sublime <br />-The Mighty Mighty Boss Tones <br />-NOFX <br />-The Flaming Lips <br />-Strung Out <br /> <br />I got more. MCR is part of what is killing Rock. Rock and Roll has evolved into something so much better than this and others (example of bad bands: Thursday, Taking Back Sunday, Killswitch Engage, New Found Glory, Norma Jean, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Panic!At the Disco- ect, ect). What say we get back to some of the roots!?! (Speaking of The Roots, if you like old school R&B... you know, when they actually played instruments... then check The Roots out) <br /> <br />Where's my Led Zep? My Yes!? My Queen? Blue oyster cult, Pink Floyd, Rush, Thin Lizzy, Bay City Rollers, ACDC, The Doors, Deep Purple, Golden Earring, Black Oak Arkansas, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Journey, Styx, The Police, The Grateful Dead, Cream, The Clash, Boston!!! For God's sake someone tell me where the hell the Boss went!?! Springsteen, man we need you. <br /> <br />That is all. <br />
1401302378|2.0|This is a moderately interesting magazine article in book form.  The result is not pretty.  It's like an entertaining Saturday Night Live sketch that has been stretched into a full length movie.  The result is some pretty thin gruel.  The author just couldn't find a books worth of compelling evidence for his thesis, but he's not one to let the facts get in the way of a good story.

The sweeper takes 8 hours to charge the first time, gives you 45 minutes to get your sweeping done and is very easy to empty when full.  It easily manuevers around chairs and under furniture as well.  I highly recommend this product as one of the few As Seen On TV items that actually works and is worth the money.

It has just the right mix of comedy and action, clever writing, and a real depth of character development that I really enjoy.
B000GIXEIG|2.0|Politically correct version of first English epic poem about Nordic warriors in the 12th century and their heroic leader Beowulf who try to help their Danish kinsmen rid themselves of a murderous troll named Grendel. Director Sturla Gunnarsson uses the story of Beowulf as an excuse to shoot a film in the strikingly beautiful but barren landscape of Iceland. There are so many problems with this production, it is hard to appreciate the few things that are good. Like the dialogue: a strange mixture of traditional English and current London slang. Or the accents: a cacophony of Scottish, British, cockney - you name it. Or the costumes: the warriors look like they picked theirs up at a London costume shop - they show no wear or use at all. And where did they get them? There are no blacksmiths, no tanners, no weavers, no workmen of any kind in the film. The only activity anyone seems to be engaged in is drinking beer. And who produces the beer? There are no brewers, no farmers, no farm animals, no farms. Only a beer hall.<br /><br />Gerard Butler stars in this \\"epic\\" as Beowulf, and, in my opinion, it is the low point in his career - even worse than Timeline, if that is possible. To add insult to injury, in the extra features, he tries to talk intelligently about what the director was trying to achieve, and it truly is laughable. The only thing I can make out is that the director was trying to show that Beowulf the poem was a piece of literary trash. So, why make a film about it? He makes the Danes out to be one step above Neanderthals. Yet, in only one century, we will have the story of Hamlet in Denmark, who was a contemporary of William Wallace in Scotland. How did the Danes advance so far in only one century if they were so stupid in Beowulf's day? Obviously, Gunnarsson didn't think about that.<br /><br />Everything has been dumbed down - for Gunnarsson's drinking buddies, I suppose. The humor is crude and would only seem funny if we were as drunk as the characters in the film. The warriors ride about on little horses, probably native to the region; but they make them look silly and ineffective. There is a sex scene between the troll Grendel (played by Ingvar Eggert Sigurdsson) and the witch Selma (played by Sarah Polley). It truly is tasteless. After making the case for Grendel not being a monster but just a misunderstood human, the filmmakers throw in a sea hag, who is obviously not human and not misunderstood. So, what are we supposed to believe about her? The final insult to our intelligence is when Beowulf tells the troll's son that he should be proud of his father, and then builds a monument to him.<br /><br />Whoever wrote Beowulf is probably spinning in his grave. This truly is one of the low points in the history of literature and film. Except for the gorgeous landscapes and interesting cinematography, there is very little to recommend this film. There could have been some decent performances, because there are some good actors, if only Andrew Rai Berzins, who wrote the screenplay, had given them something to work with. This may have been good enough for Gunnarsson and his drinking buddies to use as an excuse to take a paid vacation in Iceland; but it shouldn't have been good enough for Gerard Butler to waste his career on, and it certainly isn't good enough for the rest of us to waste our time on.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithrs in the film.

B000MCIBE8|5.0|The Doors were one of those really great rock bands -- they flared up briefly, shone brightly, and then died away with the untimely death of their frontman, Jim Morrison. And listening to their debut album, it's easy to see why people still listen -- hard-hitting, swirling bluesy-rock songs, with sensual vocals in the middle.<br /><br />It opens with gritty riffs and a rippling organ, forming a catchy, dark melody that seems to be full of urgency. And the song Morrison sings is full of emotion, ranging from affection to a haunted paranoia. \\"I found an island in your arms/Country in your eyes/Arms that chain us/Eyes that lie/Break on through to the other side!\\" he sings smoothly.<br /><br />The songs that follow are in the same musical mold, but they try out different combos -- jazzy rock with mellotron, plaintive raw rockers, a delicately soaring mythic ballad, rough bluesy rock with a twangy edge, and the howling, impassioned \\"Back Door Man.\\"<br /><br />It also contains two of their most famous songs: the legendary \\"Light My Fire,\\" a shimmeringly catchy little single. And it finishes up with the legendary \\"The End,\\" a sort of eerie symbolic journey-song with an Oedipal twist. \\"Ride the snake, ride the snake/To the lake, the ancient lake, baby/The snake is long, seven miles/Ride the snake...hes old, and his skin is cold...\\"<br /><br />This isn't the Doors' most polished work, but it's definitely their most passionate -- you can hear in Morrison's voice, and in the blasting-out instrumentation. These guys were just starting their musical journey, and they were full of enthusiasm and musical inspiration.<br /><br />And that musical inspiration shines in these melodies, whether it's raw grimy stuff influenced by the blues, or some more polished, danceable songs. Robby Krieger twisted some amazing riffs into shape, and John Densmore providedthe drums. And Ray Manzarek deserves special attention for those brilliant rippling keyboards, including the famous organ intro.<br /><br />But what makes it beyond great? That would be Morrison. His cryptic songs are full of mythic allusions, sexual hints, giant snakes, dusty highways, and nameless women. And his smooth voice can change from a croon to a howl to a chant at a moment's notice.<br /><br />\\"The Doors\\" show off the Doors at the start of their public career, overflowing with musical skills and energy. Definitely a must-listen for classic rock fans.organ intro.  <br /> <br />But what makes it beyond great? That would be Morrison.

Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Steve Wynn, et al reading \\"The Secret\\"?  I don't think so...
B000NA28IE|2.0|I read the book before seeing the movie.  All the reviews I've read said how that was a mistake, but The Lord of the Rings movies weren't entirely faithful to the books, but they were still great movies; so, I thought how bad could this movie really be with such good source material. <br /> <br />All I can say is that the screenwriter must have just flipped through the novel, stuck their finger down and said \\"Here - let's write about this scene\\". <br /> <br />After watching the movie, I listened to the beginning of the Director's Commentary - I got as far as Saphira's growth spurt where he said \\"look at the dragon's expression, even she is surprised at how fast she has grown\\".  He could have concluded that sentence with \\"...and doesn't know what is going on.\\", I think that would have captured the spirit of this movie. <br /> <br />I feel sorry for Jeremy Irons - once again he gives a stellar performance in a truly crappy movie (re. Dungeons & Dragons).

B000059T5O|4.0|I like blues and I like Tom Waits.  This album is the kind you don't get tired of, but it takes at least 4 full plays through the CD to start appreciating the songs.  I painted my basement which took two days and played this CD at least half the time.  That was back in 2003, and this still is a regular in my CD changer.  So it is definitely a grower and not a slam banger. All I can say is like a fine wine sit and savor it and you will find yourself coming back to this CD again and again.  It has even made me seek out the John Hammond catalog and listen to him more.  Fine guitar playing.

He did this disc because he loved Syd.  Syd loved him.  Gilmour produced much of Syd's post-Floyd work.  It seems that this is a genuine loving tribute to a genius that deserves to be rediscovered.  Waters is a jerk who never got along well with Syd and was the driving force behind Syd's ouster from the band.

1582701709|2.0|Clearly positive thinking can produce effects on your behavior and in turn the course of future events in your life. This is not disputed. However, Rhonda Byrne got the mechanism very wrong, many of her claims are not supported with proof, and her values are amiss. <br /> <br />First, she appears to have a casual dismissiveness about science. For example, to paraphrase she claims that calories in food do not make you fat, but the thought that food makes you fat makes you fat. This is clearly false. <br /> <br />Second, she cites several famous figures as having essentially lived and endorsed the philosophy she espouses, but gives no references to support her claims. Some were manic depressive, a common trait among many high achieving people in history. One person she mentioned was President Lincoln, who was well known for battling depression, lived through the bloodiest and most tragic war in US history, and was ultimately shot to death. <br /> <br />Third, she claims that every religion is essentially the same and in line with her Secret. This again is false. For example, she claims that there is no such thing as sacrifice, that you don't ever have to give up something precious for the greater good. This is directly contradicted by the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. <br /> <br />Fourth, the book is excessively materialistic. She encourages for example closing your eyes and picturing your hands on the wheel of an expensive car, or sitting in a big, expensive house. She claims that earth has enough resources for everyone to live the lifestyle of the rich without coming at the expense of others or any tradeoffs in general such as environmental. <br /> <br />Fifth, she argues that when bad things happen to you it is because of your own negative energy. i.e. the holocaust or slavery was their own making? <br /> <br />While there are other good points made in the book, such as being thankful, being positive, and sharing with others, I simply can't recommend this book.
B0000009SG|5.0|\\"Overnite Sensation\\" was the record that set Zappa's direction for the next couple years. A new \\"Mothers\\" line-up, stripped-down sound, and a different approach altogether. In many ways, this was his favorite line-up, every musician featured was an accomplished musician in his or her own right, and the material showcases all their talents accordingly.<br /><br />At this point, it was apparent to FZ that dumbed-down lyrics sell, so that's what he gave the audience. Lyrically, silliness like \\"Zomby-Woof\\" and \\"Montana\\" don't really pack any punch, but they still come out of your speakers without compromising your integrity too much. But, like the early records, where the magnificent musicianship is offset by casually tossed-off vocal mistakes, here the contrast is silly words, well sung, but silly nonetheless, delivered in front of some incredible sounding music.<br /><br />There isn't really all that much to say about this work that hasn't been said already, it's just a very slick performance of some vintage early 70's funk/jazz/rock.<br /><br />Vocalist Ricky Lancelotti was to join the band for the tour they were to soon go on, but injured himself, and didn't make the tour. Here, in \\"Fifty-Fifty\\" and \\"Zomby-Woof,\\" the listener is given a taste. Unbelievable vocal pipes. The whole band as a unit is top-notch, jazz violinist Jean Luc Ponty adds a little elegant touch, as well as some furious soloing, and Ruth Underwood's (nee Komonoff) percussion helped forge the trademark 70's Zappa sound. Plus, listen for Tina Turner's unbilled vocal performance. Ike really was a creep, wasn't he? The \\"Ikettes\\" give it a little color with their voices, but weren't allowed by good ol' Ike to receive credit for their work, nor payment for multiple sessions. They were to only be paid for one session. The business is full of these types, but, I guess, so is the whole \\"civilized\\" world.<br /><br />From the beginning notes of \\"Camarillo Brillo\\" to the fade-out that ends \\"Montana,\\" \\"Overnite Sensation\\" is one very enjoyable, vintage recording.le, vintage recording.

0060885378|5.0|I remember checking this book out of the school library over and over and over- I tried the other Little House books, but for some reason, this one sticks with me. I recently bought a copy to add to my growing children's library, and of course I had to read it again. Admittedly, there isn't really a plot here. Basically, this is Laura Ingall's life in the big woods, from fall, through winter, and then right up to the next fall. She shows you how people lived in the Big Woods of Wisconsin. This may sound boring to some, but it fascinates me. Laura writes about smoking meat with clean, fresh hickory chips. Then there is the day they butcher their pig, and it's amazing how not a bit of the animal is wasted. She describes in detail other bits of frontier life: making butter, cheese, bullets, and my absolute favorite, the maple syrup! You can almost taste the delicious home-made food! It's amazing what we take for granted these days. I also like the fact that these children are so content and happy in their rough life. They each only have a single doll to play with- the rest is up to their imagination. When they receive a piece of candy after their first trip EVER into town, Laura wraps hers up in her handkerchief to keep always, it's much too beautiful to eat. I just love everything about this book, and it makes me want to move out into the wilderness and \\"rough it\\".<br /><br />If you find this book more tedious than the others, I would suggest you study this period in American History with your child (perfect for homeschoolers!) and then read Laura Ingall's account of her own life- see if that peaks any interest. This book is so rich and quaint- it would be a shame to skip it in lieu of the other Litte House books!
B000LC55F2|5.0|What a treat it must have been for the ladies: two magicians, each trying to outdo the other, and both far too good looking and well built for their own good. Yes, a good time to be alive. <br /> <br />Bale's and Goodman's characters (Borden and Angier, respectively) were not nice men. There was no one to root for in the film, and as good as it was, that might have been one of the reasons it didn't do as well at the box office as the filmmakers would have liked. But it made for a more realistic story, and for that, they get high marks. <br /> <br />In a nutshell, it is a story of one-upmanship. Each magician is desperate to outdo the other, and will do whatever it takes. When Borden develops a trick unlike any other, The Transporting Man, Angier will stop at nothing to learn the secret. <br /> <br />The plot meanders a bit, and the ending doesn't feel organic, but it still makes for excellent cinema. Just don't expect to have your villains laid out for you. You'll have to make those decisions yourself. <br /> <br />It seems I'm saying this a lot these days... 4½ rounded up to 5 <br />

B000M341QE|5.0|If there is a lesson here, it is this: stick with the truth.  <br /> <br />I don't know why it took me so long to see this film. When I first read about it, long before its release, the premise hooked me. An undercover cop working a mob boss, while a cop is working undercover for the mob. The cast didn't hurt either: DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Baldwin, Wahlberg, and Sheen belong to an elite crowd, and can all turn in strikingly realistic performances. (And did.) <br /> <br />Damon plays Colin Sullivan, a straight-laced kid who grew up under the wing of mob boss Frank Costello, played demonically well by Jack Nicholson, and who later joins the police force and works his way quickly up the ranks. From within, he becomes Costello's rat. <br /> <br />Billy Corrigan, played with impressive range by DiCaprio, is to Sullivan what a negative is to a photograph. He grew up surrounded by all of the wrong influences, but rose above it to become a cop. Because his superiors (Sheen and Wahlberg) don't trust him, or believe that he will ever make a good cop, he goes to work undercover in Costello's mob. (Honestly, I had a hard time swallowing the rationale behind that, but I'm willing to suspend disbelief.) <br /> <br />There are both surprising and predictable plot twists, but what impressed me most was how every action taken by a character had an affect on another character or characters. This was a well and carefully plotted story that, in the hands of a less skilled director, might have been a mess. Scorcese deserves all of the praise he has received. <br /> <br />Some have complained about foul language and gore. While both exist in the film, none of it is gratuitous. Frankly, I expected Irish cops to swear every three words as opposed to every ten. Add in corrupt cops, a scheming mob boss, an FBI informant - there's going to be a bit of gunfire. Scorcese kept the violence close, not to shock or abhor us, but to make those scenes that much more believable - if not tangible,as they were to me. <br /> <br />All of the actors had to be spot-on in their roles, and they were. I've never seen a more believable good cop / bad cop duo than Sheen and Wahlberg, and within the first two minutes of seeing Wahlberg onscreen I understood why he received an Oscar nod. DiCaprio also was worthy of recognition, as his character bore the brunt of a conscience. He was at once brutal and vulnerable. <br /> <br />Corrigan (Damon) and Sullivan (DiCaprio) have precious little time together on the screen, but as everything they do affects the other, it seems as if they are neck and neck. Their relationship, as it is, drove the plot. Luckily, they were guided well. <br /> <br />4½ stars, rounded up to 5. <br />
0743298020|5.0|I achieved absolutely nothing today as I spent the entire day with my nose in this book. It has been a long time since I've found a story such as this & it was a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />One review said it was too much like ROse Red...well, embarassingly enough that's why I decided to give it a go. But this was 100 x's better. Yes there was a large house, yes there are rumored ghosts, yes it is a home filled with secrets - but that's where the comparison's end.  <br />The twists and turns were perfect, and just when you think you have it all figured out...WHAMMO! There's one that never entered your brain! <br /> <br />I loved it loved it loved it...and I hope Hollywood doesn't catch air of this b/c they could never do it justice. It's not just the story & where it takes you....it's the WORDS. Each sentence is profound and poetic - Hollywood can't touch that.
B000NA28IE|1.0|I read the book for this a few months ago.  Even though it wasn't the greatest book, it did have a lot of good parts to it.  Unfortunately, all of the best parts of the book were removed from the film, and replaced with mediocre parts, at best. <br />In the book, there were Elves, Dwarves, Dragons, and a bit of magic.  I the movie, there were no Elves, no Dwarves, the Dragon was a flying chicken (i.e. feathers, instead of scales), and the magic was lost. <br />The acting in the movie was poor, and the plot was rather thin.  You didn't get a chance to feel for any of the characters, since there was very little in character development. <br />All in all, there isn't really anything that can be done to redeem this movie.
1582701709|1.0|I am a practitioner of Buddhism and have also studied and read about the Law of Attraction. I had high hopes for The Secret as it was being spoken about by people I thought highly of. After reading it, I found it to be more along the lines of an infomercial rather than an educational or enlightening text. It did not take into consideration the actions of others, the environment, choice, etc. It read as though one should be able to wish things into being instead of working hard and making good choices and forging the plan and path to achieve one's goals. Because I have read so much about these topics, I understood the underlying meaning of The Secret, but this book did a disservice to the subject of the Law of Attraction in my opinion. It was put together in a strange format...again, like an infomercial, and it didn't touch the deeper meaning of the Law of Attraction. This was a piece of fluff with no real meaningful content.

It's a story teller's template.  A blueprint for idea expression.   Blake's expertise is family comedies but S.T.C. works beautifully on ANY type genre.  If you're already experienced, you can use S.T.C. techniques al a carte to improve what's lacking.  Brand new to screenwriting?  Blake has laid out an extremely simple, easy-to-use structure format that you can base your whole story outline on.   <br />  I am extremely jazzed about this little book and I'm recommending it to students and seasoned professional alike.  In the first thirty minutes of reading, it helped correct a screenplay I've been struggling with for two years.  This is the best $12 I have ever spent.  If it sold for $50, it'd still be worth twice the price!   <br />  SAVE THE CAT will save you time AND money! End the story struggle! End downtime!  Plus Blake's wit and humor make it a very fun and entertaining read!  It's true.  It IS the last screenwriting book you'll ever need! <br />

In my opinion this is an attempt by Sony to double dip the pockets of consumers.

0385751060|4.0|I had wanted to read this book for months, ever since I first read that it was about a boy whose father was a Nazi instead of a boy targeted in the Holocaust.  And when I finally got to read it, it was immensely captivating and easy enough to finish within a few hours.   <br /> <br />It wasn't until I had finished that I realized I felt dissatisfied.  The ending was an impressive bit of irony but an incredible way for Boyne to cheat the readers of actual character tension.  Based on some of the reviews I had seen here, I had expected a conflict to develop between Bruno and his father, but the ending only allows for about 2 sentences to resolve the moral issues of the father, and even that's done rather weakly.   <br /> <br />I join other reviewers in wondering who the audience of the book is.  The writing so closely sounds like a 9 year-old boy that claiming it's for high school audiences is ridiculous, but the subtlety in the content (for example, I don't think Boyne ever outright said that anyone at the camp was killed) is too mature for young readers, as is the hint of adultery.  If a child is reading Harry Potter or Newbery books I can't see a reason for this book to be witheld.
B000NA28I4|4.0|\\"Eragon\\" is a film that surprised me. According to what I had heard, it was far from being a good movie, but I was curious, so I decided to give it a try. A friend had given me the book on which this film is based as a Christmas present, and I decided to read it if the movie had at least something that managed to charm me.<br /><br />Regarding the plot, I suppose I should start by saying that the main character is Eragon (Ed Speleers), a young man that discovers a blue stone he wants to trade for something to feed his family. Unable to do so, Eragon decides to keep the stone, and receives a very big surprise when the stone turns to be a dragon's egg, and he makes the acquaintance of a new friend, a young dragon named Saphira. The birth of Saphira is a powerful magical event noticed by many, among them King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), the man that rules Alagaesia the land where Eragon lives.<br /><br /> Galbatorix used to be a dragon rider, but he betrayed the other dragon riders and became a tyrant, ruling his empire with strength and without mercy. From his point of view, Eragon and Saphira are a threat, and they must join him or be wiped out.<br /><br />Galbatorix makes the wrong move, though, and turns Eragon into an enemy. The young man decides to join the Varden, those that oppose the king. With the help of Brom (Jeremy Irons), an old bard that is a lot more than what he seems to be, Eragon will try to find his path, with Saphira by her side.<br /><br />That sounds interesting and you want to know more? Well, watch the movie. It is not perfect, but it is entertaining, the kind of movie that engages the spectator quickly in the adventures of the main characters, and makes them care. Of course, recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS: By the way, after watching this movie I immediately started reading Christopher Paolini's \\"Eragon\\", and I loved it. I liked this movie quite a bit (3.5 out of 5 stars), but the book was much better, so if you haven't already read it... What are you waiting for? Go :)en't already read it... What are you waiting for? Go :) <br />
0609610570|1.0|Only good thing I will say about this book is that at a 50,000 ft level, the concept is good - organizations have to create a culture that ensures accountability and hold people to this.   <br /> <br />While this is good, everything else about the book is terrible.  The authors write this book in too much of a storybook fashion and keep repeating the same concept over and over which gets annoying.  On top of that, the so-called vanguard CEOs and companies that they keep referencing over and over again are those who have been shown to be underperformers in the long-run (look at the recent track record of these companies) - Bob Nardelli from Home Depot, Dell Computer, Wal Mart, EDS, in fact look at Bossidy's own performance at Honeywell.  Clearly, both these guys' so-called brilliant advice is flawed, old-school, and full of holes if their role-models cannot sustain performance in the long-haul.  They are both too Jack Welch-ish - and those who have been in industry long enough know that much of Jack Welch's methods are very short-sighted (look at Six Sigma, and how the majority of companies that have implemented this keep trailing the S&P 500 or better yet, read Fortune Magazine's article from last year which debunks nearly all of Jack's management techniques).   <br /> <br />For those who really want a good management book, I recommend Jim Collins' Good to Great. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time and money reading Ram and Larry's hot air.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|Good Lord, I just love Mastodon. They are truly one of the best modern metal bands on the face of this earth today. Their first album \\"Remission\\" was absolutely phenomenal. Their 2004 sophmore release \\"Leviathan\\" was even more better, but however the Georgia quartet have outdone themselves yet again with their 2006 release entitled \\"Blood Mountain\\", and I definately applaud them for that. Words just can't even describe how incredibly phenomenal this album is. I just love it so much, I could just listen to it 24/7. The musicianship on here is just off the charts. Brann Dailor's drumming is just absolutley insane on here. I mean his speed and technique is truly phenomenal. Troy Sanders's vocals are top notch and his bass will beat you to a bloody pulp. Guitarists Bill Kelliher and Brent Hinds really shine on here with tons of great crushing riffs and some nice tasty leads, solos, and melodic harmonies. The opening track \\"The Wolf is Loose\\" kicks off with a short but sweet killer drum solo before kicking in with some thrashing snare fills, crushing guitars, and some aggressive screaming vocals. This is my favorite song on the album. The second track \\"Crystal Skull\\" is another favorite of mine which includes a nice tasty guitar solo and guest vocals from Scott Kelly of Neurosis. \\"Sleeping Giant\\" is one of the slower tracks on here which features some nice harmonic leads. \\"Capillarian Crest\\" and \\"Circle of Cysquatch\\" are other headbanging classics with more awesome guitarwork and killer drumming that will make your head spin. \\"Circle of Cysquatch\\" also features some robotic like vocals from Troy as well.  Another one of favorites on here being track six \\"Bladcatcher\\" has some of the most addicting harmonies and leads that my ears have had the pleasure of hearing. \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" has some steady marching like snare drums and crushing riffs, and there's also another great solo near the end. This song also features guest vocals from Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. The closing track \\"Pendulous Skin\\" is a nice soft accoustic instrumental that features some nice mellowing solos near the end.

B00005JPCF|4.0|I wish there was a little more tapping in the movie, but it was an entertaining film.<br /><br />The music was great, and there are many parts of this film that will keep you smiling and laughing.<br /><br />Stephen John Beccia<br /><br />author of The Treelanders--Journey to the Giants
B00005JPLW|5.0|Frankly I don't understand the controversy surrounding the movie 300. Why? Because being politically correct isn't a movie's job. Plain and simple. If that were so then every bit of degrading the Native Americans by the US Army must be taken out of the family show \\"Dr. Quinn - Medicine Woman\\". Audiences are intelligent enough to realize that this is a movie based on a graphic novel, not an accurate depiction of what actually happened. To cite another example: If 300 is a so \\"racist\\" then all the contra English undertones must be edited out of \\"Braveheart\\". Yes, it's that simple!  <br /> <br />The movie itself is a stunning piece of art. I originally watched it because I'm a fan of its leading man, Gerard Butler, but I was floored by the entire cast and the entire movie. Gerard Butler shines as Leonidas and his fierce outcry \\"Spartans, tonight we dine IN HELL!\\" is already a classic. It's a movie about heroes and sacrifice, about magic and war, about love and loss. All of which is presented with gritty realism and yet artificial polish. The action scenes are eye candy and the fangirl in me couldn't help but enjoy the...view....of Butler an his warriors dressed in codpieces and capes, HOT darn it!  <br /> <br />It's amazing entertainment done well by everyone involved. I heard that Snyder's new project may also include Mr. Butler and that's wonderful news! Why? Because those two are DYNAMITE!
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Martin Brody's best line of the movie. This award winning cast has left a mark on many people who going swimming in the ocean, and now fear getting eaten by a shark--and not just any old shark ...a great white, the mother of all sharks. CHOMP ...add blood here.<br /><br />This is more than a movie about some guys going fishing. There is tenson throughout the movie. Its real. Its dramatic, and tramatizing.<br /><br />I remember  the bucket of popcorn I lost the first time I saw this movie--theres a scene when Richard Dryfus goes underwater at night, he finds a shark tooth lodged in a hole in a sunken ship and then POP! a severed head appears in the hole of the vessel. I had jumped so hard that I lost the whole large bucket of popcorn, all over me, and the people sitting around me.<br /><br />You will love this classic shark movie ...oh and lets not forget about the chilling theme music daaa dun, daaa dun, da dun!<br /><br />Stephen John Beccia<br /><br />author of The Treelanders
B00005S6K8|2.0|The problem with this movie is that the actors could not decide whether they were trying to be themselves or the old actors.  Julia Ormond, especially, kept sort of, but not quite, acting like Audrey Hepburn.  It didn't seem to be a case of her not being able to pull off the character; it just seemed like either she or the director could not decide whether they were doing something new or directly remaking the old version.  It would have been better if they had completely cut ties with the past.  <br />  <br />The movie also seemed to move quite slowly, and there was very little chemistry between Julia Ormond or either of her suitors.  I love Harrison Ford, but Linus here just came off as a jerk, and Sabrina came off as too stupid to see how mean he was.  The crucial love scene between them was rushed, and far too much time was spent showing how scheming he was.  <br />  <br />If you liked the 1954 version of this movie, I would skip this one.  I was disappointed.
0790731940|4.0|I love this movie but was a little disapointed because the movie had finger prints all over it and it was a little scratched. The DVD was labeled as \\"like new\\".
B000002JOH|5.0|This is hands down one of the best metal albums ever conceived. And to be one of the heaviest albums on the billboard charts is amazing. This was better than all the radio alternative rock, and was such a milestone in a world that wasn't over-crowded with insignificant MySpace bands. Til this day, I can't imagine any bands making better, and more impressionable music than Pantera or Slayer.  <br />Every single riff on this album is memorable -- Neither too refined nor too dissonant to be hooked by. The tempo gets your heart racing without intaking in sort of uppers.  Dimebag Darrell's guitar leads are on the prodigy level of those best guitarists who have ever lived.  He both knew how to shred, and write really creative and rocking music. Phil Anselmo's lyrics may be raw and often juvenile, but his aggression and passion is totally raw and genuine. Every time he pushes a guttural scream, you can feel his anguish escaping.  Vinnie Paul is a master of solid drumming with the perfect use of double-bass without overdoing it. All of Rex's bass lines are bluesy solid and compliment all the solos.   <br />The production on this record is razor-sharp and huge sounding. Both tight sub-tones, and crisp distinguishable highs. A pristine sound that seems to have been lost with todays' home Pro-Tools studios and infatuation with lofi Indie rock. The drums are very attacky but unlike with usual triggers, you can hear the resonant decay.  The guitar sound is like that of being crushed by a brick wall. Unlike todays' recordings with background guitar, and overly loud vocals, the mix is extremely well-blended.  At nearly an hour, this is truly a full length, with never a dull moment. Not one song sounds exactly like the next, yet they all sound like they belong on the same record.   <br />Highlight tracks are the intro \\"Mouth For War\\" which starts with a hard-hitting groove, and ending with a fast-paced thrash outro, transitioning into \\"A New Level\\" which rings in with a truly heavybeat that makes you want to stomp your feet into the earth and punch through cinder blocks.  \\"Walk\\" is one of the simplest songs, yet is heavy and captivating in such a way that it never feels dull or stale.  \\"F***in' Hostile\\" is a short and to-the-point Thrash Metal hymn that just exudes shredding and anger, with a totally flaming solo.  \\"Hollow\\" begins with acoustic guitar topped with a sweet harmony. The first half of the song entails clean singing. The song is beautiful without ever sounding soft for like a ballad, and the song transitions into an ultra-heavy finish to close the album. My absolute favorite track on the album (and one of my favorite Pantera songs) is the often overlooked \\"Rise\\".  It instantly begins with relentless thrash with a Mouth For War groove verse.  The solo clocks in at nearly a minute, and is one of Dimebag's raddest solos of all time, double layered in part like something Tony Iommi would do, with no rhythm guitar to fill in the void. The solo is so quick and precise, that you never need background distortion to fill it. The walking bass line does the trick.   <br />There isn't an angle on this album that isn't nailed down (with the exception of ballads, which are totally unnecessary to complete a record).   <br />In conclusion, it is rare these days to hear an album that never tires over the years; where the music is strong enough to actually cause your body to release endorphins and raise your heart rate. Vulgar Display of Power is a pinnacle in heavy metal music that is completely original, and has inspired thousands of bands thereafter. I doubt this album will ever be topped.
B00000JNO1|5.0|Love this group. I like that it had a history of the band up to this point in their career on the inside sleeve. I like the bonus tracks as well.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Said to be the best thing since Seasons In The Abyss. I say rather than since, it actually is probably one of the best things Slayer has ever done. It has much more of a Seasonal feel, with a little bit of the God Hates Us All aggression. The riffs are once again a bit more harmonious. The album consistently thrashes from start to finish, but with a lot of dynamics (unlike Reign In Blood). The production is outstanding, and tonally better than any previous album. Dave Lombardo returns to the band, and delivers his most precise performance ever. Probably the first Slayer recording that actually has exact double bass that matches the detailed picking patterns. The solos are, well, undeniably Slayer (totally shredding!). The vocals are less strained and work well. Each song is a bit more progressive than other Slayer albums too, and introduce a few new hints (that were not overwhelmingly used) such as blasts, breakdowns, and ambient death growls. It sounds very Slayer, but it doesn't sound like everything Slayer has done in the past. Its actually something that non-Slayer fans could begin to like. <br />
0895260131|5.0|The P.I.G. Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) is a well researched, well written book.  Though it is obviously biased at times, it still provides accurate information on Islam and Crusades.  Spencer backs up all his statements with quotes from the Holy Qu'ran (which are all accurate, as I have checked in my copy of the Holy Qu'ran), as well as extensive references and additional reading material.<br /><br />Having spent a lot of time in the Middle East, and even more in the Muslim part of the Balkans, I often chuckled at Spencer's courage in saying it how it actually is. I have found only minor mistakes, such as inconsistent spelling at the very beginning, as well as the wrong date of the Battle of Kosovo Polje (Spencer writes it happened on June 15 1389, whereas it occured on June 28th 1389, also known as Vidovdan in Serbia, or St. Vitus' Day - page 154 of Spencer's book).  These are relatively minor details when we take the big picture into account.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to everyone who lacks any knowledge of Islam - it is a good start, as the book is very readable and not at all dry. As I mentioned above, Spencer provides us with a list of additional reading (both pro and against his point of view).  It is very important to remember that this is a point of view, and should be accepted with an open mind, as this topic is vast.  It was my personal choice to agree with most points Spencer made.  Great reading!
B000H5U65C|4.0|I gave it 4 stars the first few listens. But just like all of their albums, after 4 or 5 listens, that's when all the greatness really seeps into my pores. Okay, flat-out, the vocals are the worst thing about the album, with an over-abundance of arbitrarily pitched clean singing. But then again, it stopped bothering me, since Mastodon has never had very great vocals. But they do compliment the storm of music. <br />The music is a bit more straight-forward and rock oriented in parts. But never fear, they break into some exceptional technical tid-bits that are redeeming. Some of the most impressive work I think, was the acoustic guitar playing (which isn't in the foreground). The intitial impression is a bit watered down compared to prior recordings, but so much is wrapped deep within the recording, that so much more comes to fruition with each listen. My only real big problem (not even the vocals), is sub-par recording sound thanks to Matt Bayles (Minus The Bear). He does a great job producing the band and capturing their absolute proficiency. But he does a piss-poor job of capturing that huge brilliant sound that Mastodon has live, and should be kept to engineering emo bands and not metal bands (since he seems to be tone-deaf). The guitar is dull. The drums are felty and toneless, unlike the live sound. The ripping bass lines are almost inaudible. For a huge raging, yet not overly refined sound, Matt Bayles should have simply produced this, and the engineering should have been conducted by Kurt Ballou. <br />The song writing is some of the most intricate that Mastodon has ever created, with raging tempos, shredding crazy riffs, and soothing mellow tracks amidst the chaos.  <br />Mastodon are one of the most unique and talented metal bands alive. A crisper recording sound, and less clean vocals would have made this record a perfect 5.
0142004235|5.0|I have to admit, when I felt the length of the novel weighing in my hands as i picked it up from the bookstore, I was a bit intimidated by what I could expect. I knew that East of Eden is probably one of the most renowned and famous piece of American literature of all time, but nevertheless, I was pessimistic when I began reading. However, that soon changed when I began to realize the brilliancy of the novel and recognized the masterpiece that it really is. This novel is truly one in a million. <br /> <br />The story is set in Salinas, California, where Steinbeck himself grew up, and follows two generations of the Trask family, the main one with Adam and his sons, Aron and Cal. The characters of Aron and Cal are purposeful allusions to the biblical story of Cain and Abel, and Steinbeck parallels them with great success. Not only does he follow the storyline, but Steinbeck is one of the few authors that is able to dig deep into the human soul and come out with something truly revolutionary: their inner-most vulnerability. His brilliant portrayal of these characters make them almost life-like, and in some ways, by spilling out their souls for me to see, I felt somewhat connected to them, and was able to share in their triumphs and falters, joys and miseries. Steinbeck so expertly integrates the story of Cain and Abel, a son crying out for a father's love, and the sibling rivalry that reins over it. This book has what every reader wants, wit, humor, perspective, and insight, all brilliantly tied together by the classic tale of two brothers.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|It is the best one so far.  I've played it a hundred times.  Can't praise it more.
0345026241|5.0|Exelent, one of the best books ever written. Anthony Burgess goes into the mind of the juvenile delinquent so vividly. great vilin to hero story.
B000HT2P9S|5.0|Neil Gaiman is British, even though he actually lives in the United States these days, which perhaps explains why the Amazon UK site has a solid list of reviews for this book, while the US site features none.  It also probably explains why I could pick up this book at an airport store at Heathrow, while it is out of print in the States.<br /><br />This is turn explains, why I am writing a review of the expanded version of the novel published in the UK in 2005 (http://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Gods-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0755322819/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/202-9780075-5837400?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1174969144&sr=8-3), not the American edition referenced here.<br /><br />The book is a jewel.  A flawless jewel at that. While the sheer scope is mindboggling, the depth of characters astonishing and the vibrancy of images captivating, it is the precision with which the individual storylines unravel only to come together in the end like a mesmerizing tapestry.<br /><br />This is what a literary critic would say, anyway.  As a reader, who was quite content with simply being taken on a journey, I only need say that I liked where I was taken and who I had for a guide.<br /><br />Gaiman tells a story that makes you happy to be alive, and quite possibly (although not necessarily) in America.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Even though the story is lifted from an earlier film, A Couch In New York, this version takes the raw material and makes it magic. Nancy Meyers had her hands full in working this miracle. The story was sound the locations delightfilled, (Who hasn't longed to be in London for Christmas?) but the cast, oh my! Ms Meyer took three of the most over-the-top actors in film and made them act. Jude Law is charming, the reptilian Cameron Diaz is sweet and Jack Black, Mr. Out Of Control, was warm, witty and funny. Perhaps working with Kate Winslet, one of the most gifted actors of this generation made the others work up to her level. No matter, work they do. Even Scrooge would have set out a brandy, lit a pipe and settled back for this terribly short 138 minute film. In the hands of a less skilled director this could have turned to mush and saccharine but Ms Meyers keeps everyone well within recommended blood sugar limits. <br /> <br />So it isn't Christmas, buy this, turn up the air conditioner, set out the wasail put on your fuzzy slippers and settle back, fire in the room optional.
B000F8O35U|5.0|It is a fact that THE LITTLE MERMAID is the highest-grossing animated movie in history and I find that completely obvious... <br /> <br />The magic of the story, the genesis of the music, the wonderful emotions of the characters and the voice acting is simply incomparable! <br />Even THE LION KING, TARZAN and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST didn't cross such boundaries... I admire Disney's work on this one... <br /> <br />Truly a masterpiece for the whole family to enjoy!
B000002TLX|5.0|Since changing all my cassettes to cd's, I couldn't wait to get my cd.  There's one song \\"Coming Back\\" I could listen to 24/7.  Since being with Amazon for quite some time now, I've really enjoyed one-stop shopping when looking for the best deals and hard to find music. CD was in great condition
0375703764|5.0|A little tough to go back and forth between the sometimes very lengthy footnotes, but completely worth the time.  AMAZING book.  I can't say anything but good things about this title...
B000051NT1|1.0|What a waste, I have 6 LP's of these performances on a collector LP box set which blows this away (Of course in vinyl standards). Even the editorial beginning says it was recorded in L.A(SF idiots, LOL). Anyway, if you can find the 3 CD version, far better collection & the sound is far better!. Search \\"Judemac forever\\" on msn.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|First off this set is superior to TimeSpace and Enchanted. The treat here is the DVD. You get to hear Stevie's comments on each video and she has something funny to say about each one. You'll see that Stevie isn't as serious as you might have thought she was. The other real treat is the Bella Donna recording sessions videos. Long time fans will really love this CD/DVD, casual fans will want the CD which has some killer live tracks, but die-hards have been waiting for this DVD. Speaking of the live tracks, one can only hope that the full Melbourne show gets a release someday. The orchestra works really well, the strings playing the riff on \\"Edge Of Seventeen\\" is very cool.  <br />Well worth the wait and long time fans won't be disappointed.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I just recieved the  CD and the CD / DVD today and I cannot stress enough to each and every Stevie Fan out there what a MUST HAVE these are!  <br />  As expected the tracks off of the CD are enough to get me in the mood  for a Stevie Concert, but after watching the DVD I have a new found affection for Ms. Stevie Nicks. Watching how much time,effort,energy and devotion she puts into making her songs perfect and preparing for her shows just to please her Fans is beyond Amazing.   <br />  The never before seen Home Video of Stevie Nicks is an eyeopening experience in itself. To watch her work on the Bella Donna album is yet another triumphant step up for Stevie. Watching The parts of The Making of Bella Donna made me feel as though I was a part of the Process, ( or maybe envious that I wasn't there to witness it in real life ). :-) <br />  I think any and every Fan , Hard Core or Newbie, of Stevie Nicks will find this to be a MUST HAVE for their collection! I want to write more, but unfortunately I can't , I have to get back to the CD / DVD. ( this is my third time listening to it ).   <br />  I am positive that anyone who purchases this will not be dissapointed. <br /> <br />[[ASIN:B000N3ST8O Crystal Visions - The Very Best of Stevie Nicks (CD / DVD)]]
B00006AUIG|5.0|It's hard to express how much I love this movie.  I love the setting, which, from what I've read, was used in it's existing condition and wasn't altered in any way to make it appear more 'scary'.  I love the creepy voices on the taped sessions that one of the characters listens to obsessively.  And I love the steadily building dread throughout the movie that keeps me glued to my seat with a tight grip on my pillow.<br /><br />Even after repeated viewings, I still find it engrossing.  Worth it for those fellow viewers that are looking for a good scare without all the gore, slashing, and torturing that have become so common in today's unnecessarily demented and twisted horror movies.
0618680004|5.0|\\"The God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I thought so much of this book, that even before I finished reading it, I bought a copy for my father (it should be arriving sometime this week Dad) and promised my reading copy to the pastor of the church where I am a member.  When Dawkins says, \\"I am only calling supernatural gods delusional\\", it echoes what John Shelby Spong (who gets a mention in the book, by the way although not for this quote) said, \\"theistic God is dead!\\"  Dawkins has done a tremendous job in aggregating this theme of cleaving superstition from the faith (leaving little or nothing in his but more in Spong's estimation) and articulating a narrative for the message.  It's a message that speaks through many voices: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Einstein:  <br /> <br />\\"I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.  If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration of the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.\\" <br /> <br />\\"I am a deeply religious non-believer.  This is somewhat a new kind of religion.\\" <br /> <br />\\"What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with humility.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The idea of a personal God is quite alien to me and seems even naive.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Man is here for the sake of other men -- above all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness depends.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />John Adams: <br /> <br />\\"Consider what calamities that engine of grief [the cross] has caused.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Sam Harris: <br /> <br />\\"Your principal concern appears to be that the Creator of the universe will take offense at something people do while naked.  The prudery of yours contributes daily to the surplus of human misery.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Luis Bunuel: <br /> <br />\\"God and country are an unbeatable team; they break all records for oppression and bloodshed..\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Blaise Pascal: <br /> <br />\\"Men never do evil so completely or cheerfully as when they do it for religious conviction.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Voltaire: <br /> <br />\\"Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Dawkins is a biologist who has written, taught and studied extensively in evolution (he published \\"The Selfish Gene\\" in 1976 and pioneered the field of memetics, wherein memes act as containers much like genes carrying information content rather than genetic content).  Instead of viewing the world as designed by some theistic entity that brought about the universe as it exists today or even setting up the rules by which life as we know it was inevitably drawn (the latter seems to be the proposal of Simon Conway Morris who wrote the also excellent and also pregnant with implications \\"Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe\\"), Dawkins describes the alternative.  Dawkins argues against chance or luck and instead on strict natural selection (along with a twin possibility of genetic drift).  Dawkins sees an 'Invisible hand' of selection where cooperating genes emerge (also cooperating memes).  Comparing Dawking and Morris on their approaches to this question of natural selection, with their implicit trust in the scientific method, evolution, Darwin, biology, chemistry and their diverging conclusions is stimulating.  This is science constantly in motion and it is pregnant with implications for psychology, philosophy, ethics and more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The persistence of unreasonable things in faith systems across cultures (and the often swift and violent defenses against those questioning it) are themes that develop repeatedly in the book. \\"One of the truly bad effects of religion is that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding.\\"  Dawkins finds interesting alliances, in producing that thought, he harkens the reader to the admonition of Christian theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer to not search for \\"God in the gaps\\" of understanding.  One of the true dangers of finding god in the gaps of knowledge is that when something challenges that orthodoxy (like the copernican halocentric solar system) one is left with theodicy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This sets up a siege against the current Creationist tactic of Intelligent Design which Dawkins describes \\"thrives like a weed in the gaps left by scientific knowledge.\\" He enumerates many examples of ID threatening writers, getting teachers fired, installed as curriculum in a charter school backed by Tony Blair himself in the UK.  Religion inherently is at odds with the scientific method itself.  \\"Religion discourages questioning by its very nature.\\"  In addition to the processes of natural selection, Dawkins notes other reasons for people seeing \\"a God-shaped gap in the brain that must be filled.\\"  There are psychological reasons why we see in things what we hope to find. \\"What we see of the real world is not the unvarnished real world, but a model of the real world, regulated and adjusted by sense data...the nature of the model is governed by how it's to be used.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />To the question of moral education and relgion's place there, Dawkins believes it is not inherently tied (and we all can think of many examples of when it can be untied especially in the case of non-believers, heathens and infidels).  Dawkins asks why God even should care so much that someone thinks God might not exist, which is clearly more a position of power for the position of priests and ministers of the faith than otherwise.  Dawkins on ethics points to Ridley whose theory points to nothing inherently religious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Matt Ridley: The Origin of Virtue <br /> <br />\\"Four reasons to be altruistic, generous or moral: <br /> <br />    1. genetic kinship <br /> <br />2. reciprocation (payment & repayment) <br /> <br />    3. attaining a reputation for generosity and kindness. <br /> <br />    4. conspicuous generosity or authentic advertisement.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Rather than dispose of the texts of religion, Dawkins speaks toward the cultural validity of keeping these not as sacred inerrant scriptures, but as meaningful stories, \\"We can give up belief in God while not losing touch with a treasured heritage.\\"  It's an interesting concession from someone who seems so keen upturning apple carts.   <br /> <br />

B000KWZ7VU|5.0|THIS is what I'm talkin about! A fantastic collection with more magnificent playing from Barenboim. The chap's hitting his stride! Having just watched the excellent 2disc '50 Years on Stage', I went looking for more. This is a superb film (6 discs) and Barenboim's Beethoven is wise and abundant - and the film's not just music. Conversation, breezy cutaways, but always returning to the reason for the season, which is Barenboim's musical maturity and his seeming emergence as a revered elder. In the Master Class segments, Barenboim even manages to get Lang Lang to LISTEN more! Young musicians have a great deal to learn from the maestro in this phase of his musical life: learning to lean on music, to trust it, to set aside ego inside one's work, and how to listen as a musician. These pure qualities this pianist possesses in spades. Absolute recommendation. How many times can you hear these sonatas played with this kind of beautiful authority? Dont even think twice. Worth twice the price.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Gnarls Barkley (Cee-lo) has done it again. This is the greatest 40 minutes of music I have yet to hear from someone as unique as he. This is one for the lover of music, a classic.  <br />Best Track: 9- Transformer
B000N3SRRC|3.0|Despite a dozen albums and being around for about 15 years, Clutch (not to be confused with another group out there with the same name) is a band I'd never heard of let alone heard. I listened with no preconceptions or expectations other than the thought that their endurance had to based on something.<br /><br />After listening a couple of times to \\"From Beale Street To Oblivion\\" it's obvious that Clutch's stock in trade is sheer competence and, no doubt, a killer live show. This is getting wrecked rock'n'roll and that level the Clutch succeeds. And it is surely that success that has enabled them to keep on keeping on.<br /><br />Like a less competent Jimi Hendric Experience or a Led Zeppelin with lesser chops  and ambition, Clutch is your standard order blues/funk rock band. While an occasional riff, arrangement or snippet of lyric will catch your attention, the zenith of the band's creativity seems to be their song titles whose cleverness is seldom matched to the words and music played in their name. For what it's worth here are some of my favorites - \\"When Vegans Attack,\\" \\"Oppossum Minister,\\" \\"Mr. Shiny Cadillackness\\" and \\"Rapture Of Riddley Walker.\\"<br /><br />The are few songs that stand out amongst the sameness presented here - \\"Child Of The City,\\" the aforementioned \\"Mr. Shiny Cadillackness\\" and \\"The Devil & Me\\" from which the CD's title comes.<br /><br />I salute Clutch for their survival and for being good at what they do. The shame of the recording industry is that bands with less than half of their ability somehow generate hype and buzz and are anointed by the rock establishment. The salvation of the recording industry, the Internet, is the perfect place for bands like Clutch to find their audience - an audience that nowadays is hungry for what they do.<br /><br />If this is your taste in music, Clutch might not be filet mignon but they are a slab of prime American beef so bring on the beer. Knives, forks and napkins not required./>
B0000057D8|5.0|I first heard this recording when I got it out of the library and found it so incredible that I had to buy it for myself.  The sound is warm, not tinny like the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields (the other recording I have, which I've never been terribly fond of), and very expressive.  I cannot add any technical comments to the other reviews already written, but I can say that I agree that Trevor Pinnock and Simon Standage are a Baroque musical force to be reckoned with.

B0006B3UEQ|5.0|Collateral is a truly excellent and intelligent thriller. One of the most captivating movies I have seen since the start of the new Millennium. I am not a Tom Cruise fan, on the contrary I would say, but in his role of contract hitman Vincent he is very convincing. Jamie Foxx is impressive. I agree with a remark that I read somewhere that the city of Los Angeles plays the third leading role in this movie. Director Michael Mann creates a fascinating athmosphere. The photography is breathtaking. I was unable to focus on the action and found myself wandering away and simply gawking at the images of nighttime L.A. a couple of times. The brutal and for some characters fatal events seem small and unimportant and isolated when played out against the backdrop of this huge antheap of a city. This is surely a movie that you'll want to see more often than once. The violence is very brutal and explicit, but mercifully short and well spread out over the story. It is also very realistic and functional violence, not the bizarre and completely over-the-top superhero stuff that you see in too many movies nowadays, where the opponents constantly smash, stab and shoot each other into a bloody pulp and still manage to keep on fighting. Collateral therefore is not your typical run-of-the-mill action movie, but instead a well-crafted psychological thriller and police-movie. I absolutely recommend it. <br /> <br />    <br />
B000MG1YC0|2.0|Sirenia is the only band who has never produced a song I didn't like--until now. I bought this new release expecting to love it all, with one or two epics like Euphoria, Sister Nightfall, or Lithium and a Lover. What did I get instead?--46 minutes of pop radio. Gone is the violin, and rare is Morten's voice. We get a bunch of Monika (who has a solid voice, but every song sounded the same). Please, Morten, tell us this is an early April fool's joke and that the real release is coming out April 2.
0618680004|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Dawkins.  I was pleasantly surprised by how readable, how entertaining, is his style.  I found myself alternately amused and incredulous at the variety of dangerous silliness in religion that so many of us (myself included) take or took seriously.  Though I still consider myself an agnostic, Dawkins has perhaps nudged me a bit beyond that.
1563898586|4.0|I had seen the movie first, so thought I knew a little of what to expect. I was still nearly blown away.

B00005JPLU|3.0|Great graphics, very heroic, fun... but historically very inaccurate.  Enjoyable film, but portrayal of the Persians made me a bit uneasy.  I actually thought there was a little prejudice there -- though I'm sure the masses won't see it that way.  They never do (lol).  Still, I would recommend the film for some grand entertainment.  Its quite possible that I may go see it again.  Enjoy.<br /><br />p.s. wasn't Achilles a Spartan??

Stevie remains as beautiful, talented, and enthralling as ever and to not order this would be an insult to Stevie!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I bought the single-disc release a year of so back and am seriously considering upgrading to this new release.  The single-disc transfer is fine, but to own a remastered version in 5.1 surround with all the special features is very tempting. <br /> <br />Of course, those into sci-fi know this to be one, if not THE mother of all sci-fi classics.  Ranking along side pictures like: The Day the Earth Stood Still, (the original) War of the Worlds, (George Pal's) Time Machine, and the like.  Of them all, this one may be my favorite.  The story (based on Shakespeare's Tempest) is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the FXs hold up amazingly well.   <br /> <br />I maybe somewhat bias however.  As a boy, I had a serious crush on the curvaceous Ms. Anne Francis and never missed an episode of her short-lived series (Honey West) when it aired in the mid sixties.  Oh, and let's not forget that this was Robby the Robot's film debut.  He may be the most enduring icon from the early sci-fi era.  Robby seems to pop up on occasion just to put smiles on our faces.  From: (the original series) Lost in Space, The Twilight Zone, to Mork & Mindy, and Earth Girls are Easy, he's libel to show up anywhere. <br /> <br />Well, I suppose that's enough reminiscing. I've sold myself on this gem all over again... Time to buy!

0307237699|1.0|I read the book after buying it at a book signing. It was my second Obama book. It was very readable, entertaining and people-pleasing. I don't think his messages have much to say to seniors or baby-boomers. He should be a youth counselor and mentor, not president.  <br />After his book signing, as I waited for my ride home, I watched for an hour as people met Mr. Obama to get their book signed. With \\"young\\" people under 40-ish, he was animated, smiling, pouring on the charm. With folks over 40-ish, he appeared bored and had nothing much to say to them. Watch it on c-span sometime and see what you think. It was incredibly obvious and made me read the book even more closely to see what his message is. I was not ultimately left with much of an impression that he can lead our country and represent the future.
0060887966|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a number of people, so i was very curious about it to say the least.  First of all, either this is a dreadful translation, or this author writes in a very simple minded, grade school level. Second, I am astounded by the accolade this book has received, given that it is not but a whole lot of hooey and hokey mumbo jumbo with a touch of religeousity and trendy spirituality that is so in vogue right now. I suppose     this kind of material has wide appeal given this novel's tremendous readership!

B0000033J9|4.0|The product is great.  My mom wanted the 1 track, Lara's Theme.  She actually was disappointed that all the other songs were on there.  I am not sure what she expected from a soundtrack.  It is exactly what I expected.
B000NA28I4|2.0|I had much higher hopes for this movie.  However, in this case, it is just another movie that takes names and very basic plot and then proceeds to write an altogether different story.  I usually deal well with the differences between book and movie, but this was too much.  As an example, in the book Brom is heroic, albeit secretive-- yet in the movie, he is pathetic and shameful (I rather pitied this Brom, where I admired the other).  I think they will have a supremely difficult time making a sequel to this movie that even remotely resembles \\"Eldest\\" because they left out or changed SO many things (including several characters) that set the table in preparation for the second installment.   <br /> <br />On the other hand my two older sons (aged 7 and 9) loved this movie and thought, \\"It's was totally awesome , Mom-- can we watch it again?\\"  Take that as you will, but keep in mind, as I do, that they have not, as of yet, read the book. <br /> <br />Summary:  If you have read and loved Christopher Paolini's books, you will probably not care much for this movie (ie-- rent it, don't buy it).  Otherwise, you might enjoy this movie if you care for movies similar to movies such as \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" (the one from 2000), which also ironically stars Jeremy Irons.

Basically, if they had a live action TV show, I know them.<br /><br />So, my opinion is not as well-informed as that of some.<br /><br />But, I know what I like and I thought this was some grade-A, high test sci-fi with a good deal of political science thrown in.<br /><br />Superman has always been of limited interest to me. He can't be hurt (technically, I know he can but who has Kryptonite sitting around?), he has the tools to deal with any situation. He has a healthy psyche. Good guy to have on your side but not particularly interesting.<br /><br />But, let's take away his All-American freedom-loving politics and partner him with a truly soul-crushing totalitarian regime. Stalin backed by Superman's talents is a truly scary thought. Soviet theory becomes reality. A true dictatorship of the proletariat becomes possible since Superman hears and sees nearly everything.<br /><br />With that you have enough to make this history teacher happy. Add to it the Lex Luthor (USA)/Superman (USSR) Cold War, a reference to Plato's \\"Republic\\",  a Soviet Batman (loved him! Loved the hat!), Wonder Woman, Area 51 and Nixon winning the 1960 Presidential election instead of JFK and you've got a great read!<br /><br />Some may quibble with details, but when you get down to it, aren't the comics supposed to entertain and take you to another world for a little while? Mission accomplished.<br /><br />Bravo.<br /><br />I give this one an enthusiastic A+.
B000N3SS80|1.0|Jennifer Lopez back with a new album.  She's trying something new and is singing in Spanish. I am suprised at how well this album is produced and everything but Jennifer's voice is still weak. She can't sing and she should stick to acting.
B000O174CM|2.0|A few notes on this film and the DVD release to help you make your purchase:<br /><br />THE PERFORMANCES:<br /><br />1. Beyonce Knowles : Obviously modelled on Diana Ross, Beyonce flits in and out of this movie, holding us only with her beauty. This woman has no acting ability, lets face it, and her singing is only barely tolerable.<br /><br />2. Jennifer Hudson : A very overrated performance, in my opinion. She sings her heart out, but to me it seemed like a whole lot of nothing. At the most, it seemed like a young woman who wanted people to notice her performance and therefore went over-the-top. I didn't like this performance.<br /><br />3. Eddie Murphy : Adequate, but badly scripted. This role could have been done by any black actor of that age group, and Eddie does not add anything special to the role.<br /><br />THE DIRECTION & FEEL<br /><br />I loved the direction, the sets and the orchestrated choreographed dance and song numbers. It all felt a bit overblown and HEARTLESS but hey thats just me. You'd probably love it more than I did.<br /><br />THE MUSIC<br /><br />We all know this was the weakest aspect of this movie. Even Hudsons' showstopper number (am I the only one waiting for her to shut up?) had no melody really. And other than \\"Listen\\" by Beyonce, I don't see anything here worth humming.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS<br /><br />My only sensation after watching this was \\"What Happened to the Great American Musical?\\". What happened to classics like \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"Carousel\\" and \\"State Fair\\"? Those were real musicals. \\"Dreamgirls\\" felt like a gigantic ornamental pom-pom stuffed in my face, and I just couldn't bring myself to like it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this movie, sorry. I just have to say that I love musicals, and this was NOT a musical. It disrespects what a musical ought to be.<br /><br />Note to directors : Please do not cast Beyonce in the lead role in films anymore. Its a total waste of precious film.

B000JJRIN4|2.0|Any Gwen Stefani / No Doubt fan will immediately figure out that this material IS INDEED substandard upon the very first listen. It really is. In no way is it the equal of the vastly superior \\"Love Angel Music Baby\\" CD from 2004.<br /><br />I am not sure why this album disappointed me so much. Sure, the lead singles - \\"Wind It Up\\" and \\"The Sweet Escape Ft Akon\\" are singable and novelty pieces at best, but musically they are obviously inferior to the major hits from her debut (such as \\"Rich Girl Ft Eve\\", \\"Cool\\" and the wonderful \\"Serious\\").<br /><br />I guess this is because the album was created out of the remnants of the LAMB First Album Sessions (a fact that Gwen does not entirely discredit). On some tracks such as \\"Early Winter\\", she ALMOST breaks out of the rut of insipidity, but then slides back into it with inane music such as \\"Orange County Girl\\" (which I personally thought was too childish for her to attempt).<br /><br />Yes, Gwen is in her late thirties now and her music should evolve. She can be as fun as she wants to, but she disappointed me with the 'forced', 'cheap' feel of this CD. There is no other word for it.<br /><br />Get this for about four solid tracks. The rest is pure filler.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B000002G9S|5.0|Today Free is best known for their huge classic rock anthem \\"All Right Now\\" which still gets played daily on classic rock radio.  The song is indeed an all time AOR classic and is the closing track on the \\"Fire And Water\\" album.  Free got fairly big in the years that they were together, but have been somewhat eclipsed by the subsequent success of Bad Company which morphed out of Free after the original band called it quits.  Of course both Free and Bad Company were fronted by one of the great rock vocalists of all time Paul Rogers, and he is in fine form throughout this release.  \\"Fire And Water\\" was the band's 3rd album and one where they really gelled together to form the backbone of what would become the patented AOR sound of the 70's.  There are lots of good songs here including the title track, \\"Mr Big\\", \\"Oh I Wept\\", \\"Remember\\", \\"Heavy Load\\", and \\"Don't Say You Love Me\\".  The music is blues based rock with Rogers soaring vocals up front and lots of tasty guitar from the underrated Paul Kossoff who would unfortunately pass away not long after the band's demise.  Rogers and Kirke would go on to fame and fortune with Bad Company.  Free is one of those classic rock bands that often go overlooked, but if you were ever a fan of the more popular Bad Company you might want to check out Free.  This album in particular is one of their best.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|ABSOLUTELY KILLER, I was so ecstatic to see Machine Head go back to their roots with Ashes of Empires which is a fantastic cd, the best since Burn My Eyes, this one....nearly flawless. It's hard to find metal cd's that you can call a masterpiece, but I don't think I'm overstating anything when I say this is a freakin masterpiece.  <br /> <br />Its got the attitude, speed and bone crushing guitars their previous cd's had (meaning first and second discs, not third and forth, stay away from those, ugh, blah, barf) but every song has numerous guitar virtuoso riffs and harmonies that are so fresh and interesting that the 10 min long first song seems as short as a radio edit.  <br /> <br />That pretty much explains it. You'll want to put each song on repeat. Each one of the 8 tracks has AT LEAST about 6 different riffs and they all kill, and you never even start to think some riff has gotten stale because right before you do they change it up.  <br /> <br />The heavy riffs aren't just them chuggin away at the two lowest strings either, they use the ENTIRE guitar, so much that Slayer would be jealous. While the frequently beautiful guitar harmonies would make Metallica (from the 80's) jealous as well.  <br /> <br />There are mellow parts all over this disc too. Fantastic vocal harmonies and melody is in every one of the eight tracks. There is pretty much the perfect balance of brutality and serenity.  <br /> <br />One example of how interesting and how much depth this cd has is while during part of the chorus of \\"Now I Lay Thee Down\\" the guitars seem to be the background melody while the bass plays a wicked riff. It's rare you can even notice that bass exists on a metal album, let alone hearing it stand out.  <br /> <br />I downloaded this illegally and listened to it 7 or 8 times straight in my car over a period of 5 days (and I get burnt out on cd's quickly say, two full spins) needless to say I'm in love and I'm am going out to buy it tomorrow.  <br /> <br />Solid, beautiful, melodic, bone crushing, fist pumping, well written, well produced, mind blowing metal. Tell your friends. <br />

Once he comes on screen the movies soars and is very good (I loved the series but the cgi hulk is better than a man in green makeup). The cast is good as is the direction but the movie feels limp for long stretches and is really a mixed-bag.
0307346609|4.0|After I read the Zombie Survival Guide, I just couldn't miss the World War Z. The author has a deep knowledge of our world, it's politics, economics, cultures. He does a pretty good prediction analysis on our future (while also quoting recent history) which might well stand true even without the Z threat. However I was a bit disappointed on the general feeling of the book, I mean, don't get me wrong, it's all very deep and profound and how he manages to get under the skin of each interviewee is amazing, but the book doesn't convey any feeling of adventure, doesn't signal the safety. Of course that's all logical, since the book starts long after the war has begun and half the population of Earth is wiped out; there couldn't possibly be any feeling of safety, and adventure is replaced by survival. But logic doesn't always have to be pure and cold.<br /><br />However, the very end was quite optimistic, which I especially liked, as to me logic and emotion combined have the most attraction.
B00005OAA6|5.0|Here I will rate each song from 1-10 (10 being the best 1 being the worst) and then explain why and maybe a little information about the song!!<br /><br />1. Not Such An Innocent Girl (8/10)<br /><br />Catchy but only after listening to it a few times! The video for this song is awesome, and her voice is really pretty in this song. Its like she's really trying to get the point through! Her first single peaking at #6 in the UK.<br /><br />2. A Mind Of It's Own (9/10)<br /><br />Her voice at it's best. Beautiful song. The only reason it's not a perfect is because some of the lyrics don't make sense...but the rest...is just...breathtaking!! Her second, and last single from this album peaking at #6 in the UK.<br /><br />3. That Kind Of Girl (7/10)<br /><br />Nice song. Not perfect. Her voice is very smooth and romantic here. Worth listening to a few times. In this song she says 'my affection AIN'T something you can buy' but when you listen super carefully, it still sounds just like she is saying 'my affection IS something you can buy'. Wierd, huh? Song about true love. Muuuushy!<br /><br />4. Like That (9/10)<br /><br />The 'naughty' sounding violins at the beginning make this song irresistable! The chorus has them too! She has girl power in this song. It's a cool song.<br /><br />5. Girlfriend (10/10)<br /><br />One of the two too good to be true songs on this album. Fast paced. The backround music is so......COOL!! In this song: Victoria gets a call from a girl who found Victoria's number in her boyfriend's pants. She accuses victoria of staeling her boy friend but Victoria says that her man was hitting on her AL:L last night and that she should be questioning her boyfriend, not VB!!<br /><br />6. Midnight Fantasy (8/10)<br /><br />Song about *cough* sex *cough*. Sort of boring but catchy enough for an 8.<br /><br />7. I.O.U  (4/10)<br /><br />Every album has it's weak point, and this is it for Victoria's first album. Song about love between her and her husband. i feel like she just needed a song dedicated to him on her album, so she just made up a few lyrics in a couple of minutes and put them in there so her husband would be happy. Not a good song.<br /><br />8. No Trix. No Games (9/10)<br /><br />Wow. Thats all i can say. WOW! the 'talking' (not singing) that she does in this song makes her sound so posh. Gotta luv it! Song about learining how to get guys...<br /><br />9. I Wish (10/10)<br /><br />This is the other too good to be true song on this album. She SHOULD HAVE RELEASED IT!!!!! She would have gotten so much more credit if she had released this. This song is about her wanting a guy SOOO bad but, she knows it's not right to give it all away on the first night, so she is hoping he will still like her is she isn't a slut. Thsi song is awesome. You will listen to it over and over again forever and ever.<br /><br />10. Watcha Talkin' Bout (5/10)<br /><br />The beginning is kind of weird. Boring song. About nothing much. She tried too hard to make this catchy so it messed up. not much else I can say.<br /><br />11. Unconditional Love (7/10)<br /><br />In the beginning she says 'you can give me diamonds' but it sound like she says 'you can get mcdonalds'. STRANGE!!!! Okay song, I guess.<br /><br />12. Every Part Of Me (6/10)<br /><br />Violins in this song ruin it. but the baby laughs in the beginning and end are laugh. it's about her son 9or daughter) I think. Cute song. maybe I would like it better if i listened to it some more.......<br /><br />Hope you liked my review! i kind of got lazy at the end, so it might not be as descriptive as I hoped, but I tried my best! Hope it helps. And overall, this album gets an (8.5/10) from me. Really good.

0679759328|4.0|This well polished short novel is a fine diversion, easily read.  It focuses on a set of society's lonely misfits who come together in a respectible, albeit slighly unfashionable, Swiss resort hotel.  The author pays due homage to Virginia Woolf in many ways:  in particular she takes a view of the way women carry themselves in the world that is neither traditionally feminist nor boilerplate traditionalist--it is a fresh view that transcends Woolf, and it was for this that I most enjoyed the book. The ending provided a satisfying piu mosso to this piece, which on the whole must be described as adagio moroso, although punctuated throughout with a subtle wit and humor.

B000MXPE7O|1.0|I can't believe this movie. It took them 2 hours and 40 minutes to tell this story. If you are an insomniac or having trouble sleeping, get this movie and you can kiss your sleepless night's goodbye. This is one of the most boring movies of 2006. I am usually patient with movies and give them a good chance to get going but unfortunately this one didn't get off the ground. I compare it to Kevin Costner's 28 Days. Matt Damon was alright in it I guess, fleeting moments of acting, but the rest of the cast fell a bit short and missed their mark. Hope this review helps your decision.
B000M341QO|5.0|I saw the movie twice in the theater, so I'm familiar with the scenes.  For some reason a couple of the scenes in this DVD version of the movie were just a tad bit different.  For someone who hasn't seen the movie before it wouldn't matter but for someone who loved the movie and saw it in the theater, it is noticeable.  Otherwise, great movie.  The best!
B000059Z8J|2.0|There are many problems with this movie keeping me from liking it. One, the opening with young Clark just drags on for far too long. I could deal with that, though. The thing that kills the movie for me (spoiler alert, assuming you've been on a deserted island for the last 25 years) is the end. Not only do I think every show/movie that uses time travel to undo some tragedy is a cop out, it was also performed in the most unbelievable way possible. The world is not a big tape!! You can't rewind it! Even as a kid when I first saw this, I realized that spinning the earth backwards would not reverse time. (It would cause some good ol' fashioned world wide devastation that would have made Luthor's scheme look like nothing in comparison.) Also, if he can fly that fast, why couldn't he catch the missles in the first place?
0060887966|5.0|Someone recommended this book to me.  In turn I will reccommend it to others.  This review is a start.  I found the journey on the pages can be one's own journey.  The story-telling is lyrical and minimalistic to a certin extent.  Leaving the reader to contemplate the story without the clutter.  I think most will enjoy this story and some may even find it life transforming.  For me, this story, it will always be dear to me...

B000N3T0DM|5.0|The subject matter of this film is quite dark.  Without giving the story away, it deals with the lives of a Spaniard family, that starts with a visit to their \\"Tia\\" (the sister of their deceased mother), who is old and very close to death.  At first glance, you won't be able to discern where the movie is heading, as it starts in a very normal way.  However, as the twists and revelations start coming, you'll be taken through a sad, yet ultimately endearing journey of guilt, sins, and forgiveness.  <br /> <br />The acting in this film is top notch.  With the entire cast pushing in some impressive performances.  I highly recommend you see this film in its original language (Spanish), as I've always found that viewing movies that way allows you to feel the power of the performances that much more.   Penelope Cruz is especially divine in this film, giving us a heartfelt and humorous performance; you'll be presently surprised how much understated humor this film has, considering the seriousness of the film. <br /> <br />My recommendation is two thumbs up.

0060574216|4.0|Apart from the fact that John Gray has been married twice and divorced his first wife (a self help book writer) \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\" is mandatory reading for all homo sapiens in that it presents a good case for why people need to understand the opposite sex properly so that we can live together. The reason for this need is quite simple... men are not women, women are not men and our parents grew up in a totally different world to our one.<br /><br />It is never surprising how many people do not get that men are men and women are women and they have differences as well as similar values. \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\" is mainly about the dissimilarities which are evident during stress and how to deal with them (note to men... not \\"solve\\" them for the other person, but \\"deal\\" with them). One of the key problems with relationships is how stress manifests with men and women and how it is dealt with by the opposite sex. If it is men dealing with men or women dealing with women you want to read about, then don't. Go socialize instead. You know the score already. When dealing with the opposite sex... this appears to be a totally new realm worth explaining... and John Gray does.<br /><br />Role reversal can occur, and does. So if a man finds himself in the women category or a woman in the man category, then this is ok and happens with a certain segment of the population. All people can experience one or the other responses to stressors regardless of sex but generally not.<br /><br />A man under stress will \\"cave\\" himself where he will shut down, not pay attention to anything and sit alone concentrating. During this period the women should leave him alone but she takes this as a sign of rejection and so pushes the man more. When these stressors increase the situation becomes a lot worse. If she keeps pushing him he will crack and things will ultimately go very bad. Bottom line here for women... leave your men think to themselves in peace. Think of them as rubber bands... they will come back.<br /><br />A woman under stress will \\"talk\\" about problems. They do not shut down. They want to talk openly about the problem and need responses from somebody... however these responses are not supposed to be logical or ration \\"solutions\\" like a man who does everything Mr. Fix-it style. He is not supposed to formulate a plan, like he does. He is just supposed to listen and be concerned with the problem, not actively trying to solve it. The woman isn't really looking for a solution. She is looking to talk generally and wants to be loved. If he tries to solve it she will be upset.<br /><br />These two types of situations are what \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\" is all about. It is a fairly dull slog to get through all 300 pages about these two above points but the lesson is critical. Men and women will do better (and score better!) if they understand these points made about the opposite sex. It will instantly improve your sex appeal. Women who know how to deal with men and men who know how to deal with women tend to go a long way further. You can see how essential something like this book truly is. Some people go through their whole lives and never get this stuff.<br /><br />On the negative I did not like the fact that this book omits that women menstruate and avoids this at all costs. This is a major failing. Instead the book deals with all stressors on equal par. These types of biochemical conditions are not the same as casual stressors. Instead Gray deals with this situation like it is just any other stressor. While the idea is the same (be loving, caring and listening) certain biochemical conditions just cannot be helped until they pass. If men think this is just another casual stressor type situation like this book seems to put forward then they are wrong. Men, don't be worried to recognize a period for what it is and know your limits. There are also things like depression and other disorders which may appear as casual stress. People can also have a mid life crises which is a totally different type of stress. Probably the biggest failing is that people all react differently to different things. This cannot be understated. This book does polarize and does box things away too neatly at times. Things aren't always this black and white.<br /><br />With all this said and done you are much better to have read through this than to not have read it at all. That goes across the board for everyone. Relationships will improve (and your pulling factor) by 100% with some simple application. John Gray just noticed something important and wrote something even more important about it with solutions. Try them... they work.mid life crises which is a totally different type of stress.

B000F48D3C|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The action sequences are some of the best ever put onto the big screen. The Army Rangers and Delta Force are brave and dedicated in their efforts to capture a violent warlord. The movie focuses entirely on a mission to capture the lieutenants of a violent warlord. It was hoped that their capture would provide new intelligence on the wherabouts of the warlord, which was the ultimate goal. When this incident occurred the President and the country had already lost interest in Somalia. This is reinforced in the movie from what we don't see- there are no cutaways to politicans and generals in some Pentagon command center debating the proper course of action. Instead General Garrison(Sam Shepherd) is reminded by a subordinate to keep Washington apprised. The movie takes place on the day leading up to the mission and the day itself. Shortly after the Rangers commence their well orchestrated operation things go badly awry. The commanders, coordinating events from blackhawk helicopters, rush to adapt as casualities mount. The sequences of soldiers confronting the Warlord's militia and an overwhelming number of hostile citizens are gripping.    The actors give fine performances and no doubt received much technical training from military advisers. Eric Bana is superb as a seen it all Delta Force soldier who gives comfort to a less experienced Army Ranger Sgt. One oddity though is Tom Sizemore who plays Colonel McKnight. All of the soldiers (save for Sizemore)accurately follow proper Army technical training by using all available cover and crouching to give the smallest possible profile to the enemy. Tom Sizemore's character defies this obvious logic and instead stands fully erect and out in the open with his big frame as bullets are whizzing by? Perhaps he thought this movie was a remake of the Green Berets.    This movie is apolitical. It entirely focuses on the actions of the soldiers as they attempt to make it back to thesafety of their base despite being surrounded by overwhelming numbers. As for the polictical events which go unmentioned- many people have characterised the events in Somalia as a failure of U.S foreign policy and of the Clinton administration. But what is little known perhaps because of our limited collective memory is that the decision to send U.S. forces to this country was made by President George Bush Sr. not President Clinton. When President Clinton took office U.S. forces were already in this war torn East African country. As history goes both of these Presidents should receive critisism for our failed effort in this country. They should both receive critisism for taking their eye off the ball. One takeaway from this film - we, as a nation, are much better at initiating military campaigns successfully then we are at ending them in the same manner.    Just as the movie Apollo 13 showed NASA personnel at there best when facing the crisis of Astronauts in peril this movie shows our armed forces at there best as they work to avoid an even greater tragedy. I would put Blackhawk Down in the top 15 war movies of all time.
0060887303|5.0|I am kicking myself for not buying it earlier! The entire time I was reading, I just kept thinking, \\"Why didn't I get this earlier?!\\" I thought it would be trashy, but it wasn't. It did have certain moments, but Sara Shepard wrote with a class that covered it up. My heart pounded the entire time I was reading, it only took me one day and when I got on here and saw that the sequel, Flawless, is due out tommorrow, I just couldn't wait! I picked the perfect time to read this book. I bonded with all the characters, Hanna, Spencer, Aria, and Emily. I also found myself missing Alison right along with them! Mrs. Shepard created characters and a world that was so real, I could almost taste it! I was swimming right along with Emily, I was trying not to eat that extra ice cream sandwich with Hanna, I was lusting after a forbidden love with Spencer and Aria and when it was over I couldn't wait for more! Pretty Little Liars is about what the title says, but it's also deeper than that. It's about love and loss, wonder and mystery, I'm still racking my brains trying to figure out who \\"A\\" is exactly. I cannot wait to read more books in this series and I know this was a book I could read again and again.

B0009QTS1M|5.0|Gladiator is a great film that has what all movies need: great acting, great plot, great sets and effects, all pulled together with that special flair that makes it a memorable viewing experience.  <br /> <br />While the extended cut of Gladiator retains the flow of the plot line from the Director's cut (Note: directors cut is the 'normal' version), the feel is a tad different in places because of some added scenes (a positive addition in my opinion). These scenes add some extra depth and dimension to the characters and the film over all that I valued enough to justify the added cost of this version. <br /> <br />If you really loved Gladiator, then I suggest this as something you would be interested in.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatres without too much expectation and about midway through, I had a revelation that I was watching the best movie I'd seen in years. Original story, incredible cinematography coupled with  the most amazing long shots ever filmed, great performances by all, socially relevant topics and themes(some seemingly taken from today's headlines), all expertly guided by the wonderful director, Alfonso Cuaron, this, along with Pan's Labyrinth are two movies not to be missed. Well worth picking up on DVD and watched again and again and again... A few scenes stand out in my mind,and without giving them away, one brings to mind a 2oth century holocaust and the other, a birth that took place 2000 years ago. They give me chills when I see it even now. Can't understand why this movie wasn't nominated and didn't win for best picture, but do yourself a favor and get it, you won't be disappointed.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I hate TV, rarely watch movies, and yet, I have watched Firefly the series on DVD and Serenity the movie twice in the last half month.  I have spent more time in front of the screen in the last 3 weeks than I have spent in the last 3 years combined. <br /> <br />A TV buff friend slipped a copy of Firefly into the household by the way of my teenage sons.  Then my husband got hooked. Finally in the middle of an episode I sat down for just a few minutes.  By the end, I was obsessed.  We bought the movie within a week of finding out it existed. <br /> <br />The show (both TV and Movie) combines everything from fast packed action to mystery with clever clues to humor to romance and a touch of moral dilemma.  What a fabulous mix!  Add to that great performers (Summer Glau is going to be a sensation and Ron Glass is already well known as a character actor) and a little cheesecake-- (my husband and sons love Jewel Staite and Morena Baccarin but Gina Torres is an incredibly handsome \\"warrior\\" woman also and I'm an equal opportunity breath catcher when watching any of the male actors) and you have a great show. <br /> <br />On top of all that the story revolves a good deal around the self-sacrificing love of a brother for his sister.  The tenderness exhibited between the two siblings make some very fine cinema. In addition, as an aspiring writer, I find myself aching to compose anything as well crafted as this show.  The Episode \\"Out of Gas\\" is a masterpiece of storytelling.  <br /> <br />Throw in a tale twined with wonderful clues and a crew that acts like kin (good and bad) and you have a fabulous family show (though some of the scenes are just too scary for the youngest viewers). I cannot recommend this highly enough. Buy and enjoy some of the greatest hours of TV and movie time you and your family will ever experience. <br />
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Stevie Nicks is one my favorite singers.  Even though I already have most these songs on other CDs, I didn't have the music videos for her songs until now.  This CD and combo contains most of her greatest hits as a member of Fleetwood Mac and as a solo artist.  \\"Dreams\\" is my favorite track.  This is her hit as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1977.  \\"Silver Spring\\" is another hit Stevie had with Fleetwood Mac that is included here.  This song is very touching.  I love her solo hits like \\"Stand Back\\", \\"Talk To Me\\" and \\"I Can't Wait.\\"  I remember dancing to the songs in the 80's.  I enjoyed the listening to the commentary for the song \\"Edge Of Seventeen.\\"  Stevie wrote this song after the death of John Lennon and her uncle.  This is a very personal song, and it became one of her biggest solo hits.  I love the duets \\"Leather and Lace\\" with Don Henley and \\"Stop Dragging my Heart Around\\" with Tom Petty too.  \\"Whenever I Call You Friend\\" is missing from this set of songs, but that is okay.  This DVD and CD combo includes great songs that are lesser known like the duet \\"Sorcerer\\" with Sheryl Crow.  This is a really good song and video.  \\"Everyday\\" is another lesser known song that I really liked.  This song is cute and the tone of Stevie's voice is great.  I loved watching the videos and listening to the music on this excellent CD and DVD combo.
B000NA2776|5.0|I might be late on the bandwagon here, but I just listened to the CD \\"Life in Cartoon Motion\\" by Mika for the first time last week and already I'm in love with it.  Unfortunately, despite Mika's success in the rest of the world, most Americans will never be exposed to his music.  Why?  It's because Mika suffers from the \\"Robbie Williams Effect,\\" as I like to call it.<br /><br />Mika - Life in Cartoon MotionMika has put together an album full of smart, well-crafted pop music.  Currently in the American radio market, there just isn't a place for this type of music.  It's too pop for Adult Contemporary, not hip-hop enough for \\"Top 40\\" stations, and not enough beats per minute for dance stations.  Outside a minor hit or two, Mika is doomed to live in obscurity in the American market like fellow stylish Brits Robbie Williams and The Scissor Sisters.<br /><br />Luckily the gay community has discovered Mika in part because of his ambiguity regarding his sexuality.  While it is widely reported Mika is gay, he refuses to discuss the topic with journalists.  That doesn't bother me.  His personal life is his business; I listen to him for his music.
B00005JPCF|4.0|When I saw this movie, I was struck by two things - how it looked and how it felt. <br /> <br />It sounds obvious, but I couldn't help but be struck by the artistry of the film's animation.  \\"Happy Feet\\" had the appearance of a nature documentary, and I mean it in a good way.  The filmmakers made a conscious effort to study penguin movement (maybe by watching \\"March of the Penguins?\\") as well as how the enviornment interacts with them.  Simple backgrounds work as well, as they are able to capture the splendid vistas of an admittedly minimalist natural environment. <br /> <br />Now, it also was meant to be a \\"message\\" film, and those can always be tricky.  I'm not a big fan of them because, when moviemakers attempt one, I get the feeling they assume the watchers are too stupid to get what they're saying without clobbering us about the head with them.  It's worse when it's done with a \\"children's\\" film.  There are two here - taking care of the environment and not casting out those that are different - and yet they're handled in a truly cool way.  Yes, the uberconservatives may get in a bit of a snit when they see the forces against Mumbles are cast to appear like mean-spirited religious zealots, however this IS a great plotpoint.  Outcasts (I speak from experience here) sometimes feel just that way - beat on and thrown out simply because we're running against the popular tide.  And the environmental point is handled, I truly believe, in a way non-humans would look upon it.  Humans really ARE \\"aliens\\" in this world, and they aren't being necessarily \\"mean\\" in how they act toward animals.  They may be just clueless to the harm they're doing. <br /> <br />A top-notch voice cast helps bring this off.  Elijah Wood may yet be one of the most overlooked actors in Hollywood because he's able to bring off a tender, desperate Mumbles with only his voice (although the animators also gave him Wood's piercing blue eyes).  We don't get to see often enough Hugh Jackman's verstilitywith accents, and here we are hearing him do a cross between Curly from \\"Oklahoma\\" (I strongly suggest anyone who hasn't yet see the filmed Royal Shakespeare version with him in it to do so) and Elvis without it seeming forced or artificial.  There are really too many performances to list, and they're all first rate. <br /> <br />The tapdancing too is great.  We only see a cartoonish replication of Savion Glover's moves, but he really sends off on sound as well.

B000H6SXMY|4.0|It's not a bad thing to say that the show is entertaining as we've all seen some clunkers, even with great talent involved.  Friends had a lot of ups and downs, not unusual for a show that ran so long.  At its best the show is laugh at loud funny.  At its worst there are no laughs.  I'd say that the acting is inconsistent too.  J. Aniston had some good episodes, but she overacted in the later years.  I like the Chandler/Monica hookup since it added a storyline where all the characters were involved.  However the engagement scene was not well acted and showed the limitations of Cox and Perry.  I think that Perry has improved though since his acting is much better in the Sorkin drama.   <br />Overall the characters are well defined and the interaction gives the show its unique energy.  The best episodes can be seen over and over,
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I don't think I've ever seen a movie work so great and yet be so mismanaged and marketed. With movies that become unlikely successes like the Blair Witch Project or Big Fat Greek Wedding then you see the error of how Children of Men was marketed, it feels criminal. Alfonso Cuaron's follow-up to the well-praised (even though I wasn't that over-ecstatic about it) Y Tu Mama Tambien is just an all around well-crafted film and a chilling idea about where the world could be headed. <br /> <br />Set in 2027, women around the world inexplicably have become infertile and unable to bear children. To make matters worse, the youngest person in the world was killed when he refused to sign autographs. Main character and former activist Theo knows its a horrible world but he's in a kind of \\"oh well\\" state of mind. His ex Julian, who is still being an anti-government activist, comes to him with a favor: safeguard a woman named Kee. Special thing is she's 8 months pregnant and in this world, she would make a perfect bargaining tool and political stronghold so Theo has to escort Kee to the \\"Human Project\\" which will help her and the baby.  <br /> <br />What the film does right in presenting the future is it doesn't take the Blade Runner approach and just simply go nuts with technology. There's been some advances but there's also been some regression and England has been reduced to a graffiti-covered hellzone and in one nice on-going joke, Theo keeps trading old shoes and clothes for other ones because he has to rather than just walk into a shoe store and get a new pair. And the notion that the entire female population becomes infertile seems almost sci-fi but then you go \\"well, if that and that happens, you never know...\\".  <br /> <br />While it's primarily a drama, it's arguably got 2 of the best action scenes of the year and strangely, they're all in the same movie and all done in one take. One (which had to be supported with a big camera rig) takes place in a car while another hasus follow Theo through the streets as everything is getting shot at left and right. What makes these work is not only do they work production-wise when you think about it (6-8 minutes at most with one mistake making you redo 8 minutes over again), but dramatically they work as well and they're not just cool camera trickeries just for the sake of showing off.  <br /> <br />Then of course there's the acting and our anchor is Clive Owen. To be honest, he was kind of bland in Sin City (probably because the voiceover was that way) but here he really shines, playing a troubled man and one who isn't some action-hero all of a sudden. He makes mistakes and his accomplishments are that much better. Julianne Moore plays a pivotal-but-small role as Julian while Michael Caine plays Theo's friend Jasper. He always works in every film he does but giving him an almost hippie quality doesn't gel as much. His \\"pull my finger\\" routine and weed smoking seems slightly out of place. <br /> <br />While not being graced with a good cover and having some light features (a documentary on the state of the world is insightful but featurettes looking into the making-of as a whole would've given more depth would've worked) it's still a wondrous film people should definately check out.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|The first Rocky film had a heart and a soul that mattered to people a lot more than the fight.  Rocky was a kind man who wanted to get through life, was unhappy about being a collector for a local loan shark, and fell in love with Adrian.  The whole Apollo Creed thing fell into his lap and changed his life forever.<br /><br />The spirit that made the first film a joy faded with each new film while the fighting sequences became the point of the film.  Sort of like they way the gadgets overshadowed Bond in many of the subsequent films after \\"Goldfinger\\".  This film is so enjoyable because it has the heart and soul of the first film and the inevitable fight (this time ostensibly an exhibition) is the right send off for the hero.<br /><br />The film opens later in Rocky's life.  He has experienced the one loss he could not bear well.  Yet, he has found the grace to bear up under its tremendous weight.  Paulie is still as miserable as ever, actually even angrier and in not very healthy way.  He lives in a row house just as he did in the first film and has a small restaurant that serves decent food but whose main attraction is for folks to come by and get a picture taken with Rocky and hear the champ tell his old stories for the ten thousandth time and Stallone does just the right touch on making the stories sound that way.<br /><br />We also see him fill some of the emotional gaps in his life in a very touching way.  Since Adrian is ever present in his heart, it is very touching to see him develop a friendship with a woman that is really a friendship and not a prelude to something that could encroach on where Rocky really is emotionally.<br /><br />The most wrenching relationship in the movie is between Rocky and his son.  Yes, sons do have to become their own man and it is incredibly tough to find an independent place to stand when your father was the heavyweight champion of the world and people want to know you to meet your father.  This is a very active force in Rocky's life and leads him in several directions that all make real sense.<br /><br />I also appreciated the way the film actually set up the fight between Rocky and Mason \\"the Line\\" Dixon (by the very capable Antonio Tarver) by actually creating sympathy for him by making him unsympathetic.  Yes, a neat trick.  The film doesn't set him as a big villain as previous Rocky films did with Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago.<br /><br />This was a very fine way to end the series and does so on a rather moving high note.'s life and leads him in several directions that all make real sense.<br /><br />I also appreciated the way the film actually set up the fight between Rocky and Mason \\"the Line\\" Dixon (by the very capable Antonio Tarver) by actually creating sympathy for him by making him unsympathetic.

B000MXPE74|4.0|The Fratellis are Barry, Mince and Jon Fratelli. <br />A Glasgow three-piece assembled through a mixture of luck and lazing around drinking a pint. <br />They are just about to get huge, so limber up and prepare to dance. <br />\\"Costello Music\\" is an uplifting and joyous set of well put together songs, blending Jon's complex tales with some simple, but effective melodies. It makes a nice change, like The Kooks and the Monkeys before them, for a band to produce a record that's all about the melody. Alongside the tunes come interesting and profound lyrics that stick in your head and Jon Fratelli can certainly put a good line together. <br />\\"And though I may be a beggar/And you may be the queen/ though I may be on downer I'm still ready to dream,\\" comes from \\"Whistle For The Choir\\", a slow whimsical acoustic driven ballad. <br />However what follows next is \\"Chelsea Dagger\\", uncompromising, dirty and raucous backed with a crowd leaping riff. \\"For The Girl\\" seems to be born into disco bliss before breaking its way out into a snarling scream that typifies the surprises in store on this record. <br />\\"Everybody Knows You Cried Last Night\\" is another intriguing addition.  Stand out tracks have to be \\"Henrietta\\", \\"Flathead\\", \\"Whistle For the Choir\\" and \\"Doginabag\\". The nearest the band comes to feeling tired is on \\"Baby Fratellis\\", but you can forgive them when you're still whistling from the previous track.  <br />Recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Tony Hoffer who produced Beck and Supergrass, \\"Costello Music\\" is amongst the most talked about indie albums of 2006. <br />The album contains a brilliant mix of the 1970's and 60's rock'n'roll, with addition of punk and catchy melodies. <br />The new album has everything that the audience likes in good rock music: well-coordinated musicians' playing, sing-along choruses and witty rhymes, it's got the style and the punch backed up by Jon's killer voice. Rock n' roll is alive and well in \\"Costello Music\\" and yet again a band has emerged to blow the socks of the last. <br />Fratellis take a melody, throw it around and then bounce it in your face. You'll love it. <br />
1582701709|1.0|In 1999 I went to see the Dalai Lama speak and the first thing out of his mouth was that he was going to tell us the secret to life. He went to the edge of the stage, the crowd got very quiet, then he softly spoke one word: \\"Happiness\\" <br /> <br />He didn't dare tell us how we were going to acquire this happiness, because he understood that would be impossible. He knows that each individual has his own view of what happiness is and there was no one secret to acquire it.  <br /> <br />I have a secret for you. Do what makes you happy. But realize too, that what makes you most happy might be to sit all day in meditation. When in meditation though, you're attempting to rid yourself of all thought, therefore making positive thought, or any thoughts, a hellish experience.
B00005JPLU|2.0|Ignore all the hype about the special effects, graphics etc.  Ignore all the 'controversy' (has there realy been much apart from the Iranian press and government and I can't imagine too many taking their opinions into consideration before going to a cinema or renting/buying a movie) This is a realy poor film.<br /><br />Yes, the special effects are exellent but for all the talk about the battle scenes (which are realy all the film is about) they are nothing more than a 3rd rate Lord of the rings (a trilogy which this film makes no attempt to hide the fact that it took influence from) This is no Gladiator, no Alexander and not even as good as Troy (Yes, even with Brad Pitts dreadful acting)<br /><br />The Persian king (who is this feminine 8 foot character who looks like a reject from the film Dune) As a previous reviewer pointed out, I almost cracked up laughing when he turned up on the screen pulled along by his Arab/slave army with those metal rings round his neck chains round his legs and eye make up (and what was up with his accent? Seemed to go from Hispanic to American to Brit English within 3 sentences), The black Persian generals (I know this was not supposed to be historically accurate but I assume the director knew that the Persia is not in Africa) Who also seemed to have problems deciding which continent their accents were supposed to come from (American one minute, British the next, pseudo Middle Eastern the next)  The imortals (who all seem to be dressed as ninjas with masks that look like leftovers from the Tom Cruise film 'Eyes wide shut') Other Persian troops (who for some strange reason are dressed as Arabs) The slow-motion reverse angle Matrix rip off during the battle scenes,  the God awful rock music that plays as the Spartans go into battle and that equally God awful speech at the end of the film (almost had me dozing off) It was almost as bad as Brad Pitts speech as the Greeks were nearing Troy in that film or Hectors cringeworthy \\"Love your woman, love your county speech\\" As he prepared for battle.<br /><br />No, this film is not poor because it is not historically acurate (It was never intended to be) It's poor because it's just plain awful.ur woman, love your county speech\\" As he prepared for battle. <br /> <br />No, this film is not poor because it is not historically acurate (It was never intended to be) It's poor because it's just plain awful.

I thought to myself \\"Now here is both an intelligent and decent musician\\" I then heard him play his rendition of 'everlasting love'  Now I am not one for corny old tunes but the energy he put into the song even had the audience on their feet.<br /><br />I hear there are different editions of this CD some missing 'high and dry' and a couple of others which is a great pity.  This is a realy nice CD to sit back and listen to after a hard day (or even in the car on the way home from a hard day) it will certainly save you from coming home and kicking the cat (they cat will definatly appriciate it)<br /><br />Sit back in that quiet room of your house, grab yourself a drink and put on this CD.

080701429X|5.0|Good stuff.  The first half of the book, which deals with his personal experience in the concentration camps, is extremely fascinating.  The second half, which I'm not finished with yet, is also very valuable--it takes longer to read due to the complexity, but it's a very different approach to psychology than I've heard in the past.  Basically it says (as far as I understand) \\"Who cares what your dad and mom did to you when you were young.  You need to find out what is the meaning of your life.  Until you do that, you won't be happy.\\"
0070511136|5.0|If you sell big ticket items B2B, this is simply the finest sales guide ever written. It can be summed up this way: <br /> <br />1. Ask Situation questions to understand the buyer's context <br />2. Ask Problem questions to uncover pain <br />3. Ask Implication questions to rub salt in the wounds (gently and lovingly) <br />4. Ask Need questions to show them how your product will make the pain go away. <br /> <br />The book has a few shortcomings: <br /> <br />1. There is nothing about finding out the client buying process (cycle, budget, etc.) <br />2. If the client has no pain, there is no sale. There are 2 ways to take a prospect - down the pain path, which this book outlines well, but there is also another way to lead the prospect - how your product/service is going to help them get to where they want to be. An example of this would be selling prime/exclusive office space.  <br /> <br />ex 1: Clients buying high rent office space are not motivated by pain - they are motivated by vision and image - where they are now vs where they want to be. <br /> <br />ex 2: You are selling marketing services, and the client is already meeting or exceeding his sales numbers. There is no pain here, but the client may buy anyway because he wants to take his business to the \\"next level\\"

B000N3ST9I|5.0|It's been a long uphill battle for Machine Head in the 14+ years they have spent in the music business. Sure, they got off on the right foot with the acclaimed [[ASIN:B000000H6G Burn My Eyes]], but after that, things seemed to get hazy for the group. In 1999, they teamed with Korn/Limp Bizkit producer Ross Robinson for [[ASIN:B00000JLC4 Burning Red]], which, despite being a great album in it's own right, set the stage for the next few years of the bands career. By 2001, Machine Head had slowly slipped into nu-metal territory, and of the worst kind, and thus, we got [[ASIN:B00005A46S Supercharger]], which is undeniably the band's worst effort. Thankfully, they got things right and in 2004, [[ASIN:B0000D96NW Through the Ashes of Empires]] saw the light of day and saw Machine Head turning once again to the sound that made them in the first place, while embracing all the musical experiments on the previous four albums.<br /><br />So what's the point in the history lesson? To understand why Machine Head's return to form has been so triumphant. \\"The Blackening\\" is hands down, without a doubt, the best thing Machine Head have done since 1994. One listen to the opening epic, \\"Clenching The Fists Of Dissent,\\" and you're opinion of Machine Head will be forever altered. I'd hate for this review to be just mindless hype, but everything you've been hearing so far is true. \\"The Blackening\\" is a masterpiece. Opening and closing with songs that push past the ten-minute mark each, \\"The Blackening\\" is a bold statement from a band who have finally stopped giving into label pressures, stopped trying to mimic everyone else's style, and generally, just stopped caring what anyone thinks. \\"Now I Lay Thee Down\\" is about the most conventional the album gets, but even that's a stretch. Even the shorter tracks, such as \\"Slanderous\\" push Machine Head over the edge as far as musicianship goes. Phil Demmel and frontman Rob Flynn play off each other almost as if their minds were one. Despite metal's tendency to show off, Machine Head's work on \\"The Blackening\\" is not. Every little sound they add to the stew just makes it all the more powerful, all the more memorable, and all the more musical.<br /><br />It's only March, and yet I believe 2007 has it's best metal album already. It's going to be a long time until someone comes along and tops this -- and coming from a band like Machine Head, who have been so inconsistent in the past -- who would have expected it? Great for them, though. I don't think anyone will question them ever again. Machine Head have proven that there are second chances in this business and more importantly, have delivered a pure-metal album that is just about perfect.tal's tendency to show off, Machine Head's work on \\"The Blackening\\" is not.

B00008EYBW|5.0|The Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice is superb, Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility is very good (though not faithful to the novel) but I tend to agree with other reviewers: this may be the best adaptation of a Jane Austen novel. Is Persuasion her finest novel? Could be but then there is Emma,   Pride an Prejudice and Mansfield Park as well as her amazing juvenalia. Why rate them? But I think it fair to rate the film adaptations. For example, unlike the adaptations of Emma which need to be longer, this film manages to \\"get\\"the novel on one DVD. The acting is beautiful, the feeling as someone said is \\"autumnal\\" just like the novel. It is a good antidote to the ever present tendency to reduce Jane Austen to \\"Chicklit\\". Think Shakespeare or as Rebecca  West said Mozart. One small objection: Jane Austen never used kissing as a romantic gesture. There is a kiss at the end of this movie. They should have left it out. Small point. See the movie--read the book!

B000N4SHPS|4.0|Rocky Balboa captures some of the drama and spirit of the first Rocky film.  With R.B., the Rocky story comes full circle.  Unlike Rocky III and IV, which were almost cartoonish, there is real emotion and drama in R.B.  The movie is entertaining and inspiring.<br /><br />Some of the acting is good (Stallone, Hughes, Young) and some is lousy (Ventimiglia.)  [Note:  Why didn't Sage Stallone play Rocky's kid?]  The script is sufficient but a some of the dialog is embarrassing.  The emotional connections and Rocky's giant heart carry the film.<br /><br />The biggest problem with all the Rocky movies (from II forward,) is that the boxing sequences are, on some level, ridiculous.  It's nice to suspend one's belief once in awhile for the sake of entertainment, but it's almost insulting to pretend that fighters could take the types of beatings Rocky and his opponents take in these movies.  The best boxers to ever step foot in the ring couldn't wildly throw punches and take shots to the head for 10-12 rounds.  Fights just don't work that way.  Watching a 50-some year old \\"retired\\" fighter go toe-to-toe for 10 rounds with the heavyweight champion of the world, a fighter in is prime, is complete and utter farce.  For me, I would have been pleased to watch a match that was more paced and deliberate, in a word: realistic.<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, it is worth watching.  If nothing else, Rocky's life lessons (never give up, believe in yourself, keep moving forward, go for your dreams) give R.B. considerable value.<br /><br />[3.5 stars]

0007204310|5.0|I've returned once again to one of my favorite authors to review his latest work. Paulo Coelho of international fame for The Alchemist, 11 Minutes and The Devil and Miss Prym, has released his latest The Zahir. According to the book, the Zahir in Arabic means present, visible, incapable of being unnoticed. It is something that grabs our thought, mind and spirit and demands our full attention. It is believed to lead to either Holiness or madness. In this book, the Zahir is a woman, an idea of a woman, a longing. Our main character sounds very familiar to our author; in fact our hero is a famous author now living in Paris, with his books being published in nearly every language. (which sounds like Mr. Coelho. This book is being published in 50 countries/languages this year alone. The author writes books that millions love, adore, and claim changes their lives. Yet he appears to have stopped living the type of deliberate life he writes about. He has settled into a complacent life.<br /><br />Then one day his wife disappears. Over time she becomes his Zahir; he writes a book about love and for a while the Zahir fades. Then he meets the man he believes she had left with and the Zahir returns.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story about becoming, and remembering who you were meant to be, not who you settled into. It will stir in you a passion to be more than you think you can be, and, to give more, and love more purely. Follow a man who goes in search of an estranged wife, only to find himself.<br /><br />(First Published in Imprint 2005-09-14 as 'Is your objective very visible?)
B000N4SHPS|3.0|it was sad to see that Adrian had died. this film reflected on alot of memorys. this film was way better than Rocky 4& and way better than Rocky 5. but overall Rocky 1&2 are the standards. Rocky 3 still has the most intensity overall. but this one was cool. Rocky meets a new lady friend who has a son. Sly&Burt Young as In Laws is the film version of Michael and Archie from the tv show \\"All in the Family\\" that kind of Chemistry. all the trademarks are in place. Antonio Tarver does a good job on screen. in real Life He is a Very Good Champion. that  Mike Tyson cameo was funny.
B00004SAJK|3.0|The steady decline of UFO over the Chapman era starts to become evident here with this fairly lightweight offering. Whilst \\"No Place to Run\\" kept the rock juggernaut going, TWTWATI slowed it down a little then breakdown came with \\"Mechanix\\". This one kicks off in terrific form with \\"The Writer\\" and fills the listener with optimism. The lack of Schenker's guitars always seemed to me to put more emphasis and pressure on the song writing and lyrical skills of Mogg. Typically he rises to the top with this great track despite the synthesizers and sax. The unusual cover of the classic \\"Somethin' Else\\" and \\"We belong to the Night\\" also give us something to rock along to in keeping with UFO tradition.  Whilst neat and professional the rest of album is much more commercial than any of the previous albums. It's generally OK but not as good or as listenable to as all the American competition in a similar vein.   \\"Back Into My Life\\" and \\"Let it Rain\\" are nice catchy tunes but there isn't much to get excited about outside of the above. \\"Terri\\" and \\"Heel of a Stranger\\" are pretty awful. Generally there is too much Neil Carter and his sax and not enough umf!!   It was about this time when I decided to give UFO a wide birth. Mechanix is OK but unlike anything previous and this direction was not for me. Perhaps aimed more at the main stream American market, Mechanix is a reasonable album and worth getting for the first two tracks.

It's like overdosing on BAD ACID with a horrible Red wine hangover. Well wait I guess THAT is valuable see Eraserhead and you don't have to overdose on BAD acid after a night binge drinking cheep sangria.<br /><br />PS. I forgot the elves with ice picks.<br /><br />PPS. I DID like Blue Velvet though.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Yes this is a review of the 6th and final installment in the Rocky saga. Rocky has been called the greatest underdog story of all time. It has been given two thumbs up by Elbert & Roeper; it has been given rave reviews and is currently 3rd in box office holiday season sales. With all of that, why would Imprint review this movie as well? The answer to that question is how the movie is relevant to students.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is called a truly inspirational story. It is the story of a man who has had it all, lost most of it and rebuilt what he could. The film was written, directed and starred in by Sylvester Stallone. But this story is older than even that. For Stallone wrote the first Rocky story and held on to it for years. He would not sell it because no one would let him star in it. With his perseverance and determination, he held onto the script until he could play the role of Rocky.<br /><br />In this film, Rocky is again the underdog. He is 53, retired, and running a restaurant. He is also widowed, and looking for something more in life. He decides to try and fight again - he is thinking something local, for charity. And yet he is given a shot at the champ.<br /><br />This is a story of overcoming - the story of living your hopes and dreams. It is about believing in yourself and following those dreams. Rocky states: \\"What is it you said to the kid? The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very rough, mean place... and no matter how tough you think you are, it'll always bring you to your knees and keep you there, permanently... if you let it. You or nobody ain't never gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit... it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward... how much you can take, and keep moving forward. If you know what you're worth, go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit.\\" And he lives that in this film.<br /><br />Yet Rocky is not the only character to face this adversity in this film. Paulie, his brother-in-law, who only has his work and alcohol is laid off from his job. Rocky's son Robert has lost his way, and is trying to not live in his father's shadow. And each of these three men must deal with their grief at the loss of Adrian, who was wife, sister and mother to these three men.<br /><br />Rocky must also face his aging body. In the beginning of the training sequences he realizes that this will not be the simple battle of determination to get the body in shape. It will be in part mind over matter as he must reconquer and retrain his body to be that of a fighter.<br /><br />Rocky's opponent Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon (played by actual former heavyweight champion Antonio Tarver) does not take the fight seriously, he has the youthful disregard and disrespect for age and experience that Rocky will bring to the ring in this battle of athletes from different eras.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa will motivate us to face our own challenges with perseverance and a community for support, and with hope and by prayer. The story will promote discussions about where we find our courage, what we want from life and how we can overcome loss and yet stand strong and remain faithful. It will also help us to classify what we call a victory.<br /><br />Rocky is not just another boxing movie, or even just a sport movie, and it is definitely not just a squeal. It is a movie that will help you find the courage to follow your dreams and encourage you to pursue hopes.<br /><br />So when the world knocks you down, you can either lay there or get up. That is what Rocky Balboa teaches us.<br /><br />(First Published in Imprint 2007-01-05 as 'Final Rocky flick hits home, the heart'.)dversity in this film.

B00005JPCF|5.0|I saw this on the big screen and planned on buying it once it came out on DVD. This is such an enjoyable,cute funny movie for us adults and kids. It will put you in a good mood. It also has a nice light(not heavy) environmental message at the end. It is such  just a well made animated feature. I am glad it got the academy award. Buy it...You will love it.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|What made Bond great was it was funny, great gadgets, easy storyline, bond girls, a family film.<br /><br />Now its volient, no gadgets, no girls and not a family film. Even though the previous Bonds weren't Ian Flemming's idea of Bond ... he previous ingreidants made Bond famous. Sean Connery got the best mix.<br /><br />This was an awful film that just dragged and relied on visual effects. I still don't undstand the realtionship with Vespa.<br /><br />Bring back the bond of Connery!
B000MGUZMU|5.0|I'll definitely have to get Funeral reading the reviews -- this is my first CD from the group and it's so unusual to be able to rank 90% of the selections as 5 and 4 star -- I try to weed out so that I can place my favorites on a custom CD, but I liked every cut!  No Cars Go and the Well and the Lighthouse are like 5+ stars in my humble opinion.  Off to the Funeral.....
0374105235|4.0|As one reviewer observes, the memoirs of \\"boy soldiering\\" occupies only a mere ten percent of the book. The greater part of the novel involves telling the author's harrowing experience before and after that of actual boy soldiering.  In the concluding pages, the author with many other Sierra Leone refugees fleeing from their own country arrive in neighboring but somewhat hostile Guinea. But the ending sort of leaves the reader hanging.Nevertheless, Ishmael Beah's style of writing this book is remarkable, remarkable in a sense that it is hard to put it down. He should be encouraged to write more of his experience in Africa. Blessed we are in our own countries and snug in our own homes with 3(sometimes more)meals a day, it makes us wonder how we could possibly ignore the sufferings and heroic efforts of survival of Africa's people much more incredible those of children sometimes younger than 10 years. People should be made more aware of the tragedies that this beautiful continent is undergoing. By 4 stars,I actually mean 4 1/2 (still highly recommended)
B000LC55F2|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and really wanted to see it again.  Great cast (who wouldn't like looking at Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman?) and very interesting twists.  Some of the twists I could anticipate, but some I couldn't.  My only complaint was that it was a little hard to follow at the beginning because it jumped around, chronologically.
0441009425|2.0|I ordinarily finish what I start reading, and I did with this one...but barely. This book has great ideas but is not written very well. The plot does not hold your attention and the characters don't stand out as interesting people. It turns out to be neat science but dull..dull...dull writing. I tried the sequel also.. same...
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Machine Head's \\"The Blackening\\" is one of the best metal cds I've ever heard. I bought it today, but have been listening to it for the past month nonstop (thanks torrent sites).  Every single track on this album is amazing. The album starts off with the 10 minute, thrash metal opener \\"Clenching The Fists of Dissent\\". 6 minutes into the song I got the chills when Flynn starts chanting \\"Fight\\", much like a harder version of \\"Creeping Death\\". That song sets the tone for the rest of the album. I can't really pick a favorite song because they all flow together so well. The vocal harmonies, along with the layered guitar work is out of this world. The songs are so complex and yet they don't feel pretentious or overbearing. When I first listened to this cd, it brought me back to when I was a teenager and I heard \\"Master Of Puppets\\" for the first time. To me, this is Machine Head's best cd. Even though the average track length is 7:30 minutes, the album is very accessible (much like Master of Puppets). It's hard to explain how good this cd really is, you just have to buy it and see for yourself. \\"The Blackening\\" is absolutely amazing.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This new James Bond is Harder, grittier and more careless than any other.  Why shouldn't he be, this is him at the beginning.  Daniel Craig is a perfect young James Bond before he's so sophisticated with his \\"shaken, not stirred\\" martini.  the action scenes in the movie are real for the most part with real stunt men and stunts. The fight on the top of a crane that is 250 feet in the air will have you holding on to the arm rests on your lazy boy.  I love the opening action scene which features the sport of jumping off stationary objects that are blowing up in the UK.  This Bond is rough around the edges but he's more romantic and \\"feeling\\" than the bond I grew up with.  You see at the end of this film why he becomes more disconnected to his emotions.  it's a step in the right direction for the 007 series and defiantly clears the pallet and reboots the franchise.  it's a good action movie with a great lead actor that knows how to hold the screen. This Bond is much like Ian Fleming intended, just like in his first book, raw and reckless.  It's a good contrast to what he becomes in the later years as an experienced 007.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Greatest Hits collections have almost always disappointed me because they invariably leave out a number of songs which were major hits of the artiste concerned. This Elton John collection is no different as four of his top ten hits are excluded. They are \\"Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds\\" (no.1 on the Hot 100), \\"Mama Can't Buy You Love\\" (no.9), \\"Little Jeannie\\" (no.3) and \\"I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That\\" (no.2). Although this album is superior to previous collections I'm afraid I can only give it a 4 star rating because when it's title says \\"Elton John Greatest Hits\\" I expect every one of his BIGGEST hits to be included!

B000N3SS80|5.0|I have always been a fan of La Lopez but always knew that there were better singer's out there.  I was shocked to hear Jenny from the Block in this album.  Girl can sing and she really just pours it out.  This is going to be a big year for Jennifer and I hate to say it girl but this IS your comback year.  Be prepared to see JLo everywhere.  This album is finally going to recognize her as a musician.  She rocked this album and I enjoyed listening to the whole frickin thing.  SHe hit some notes that I'm sure even surprised her.  Who knew Jennifer could sing like that?  She should do another spanish album rigth after.  She sings so much better in spanish.  Eacj song has actual meaning behind it as opposed to \\"Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, I'm still Jenny from the Block\\"  Uh no honey you aint no more.  You proved yourself and yeah... I get it... you can sing.  WORK IT  girl.
B000001EUL|5.0|I agree with the reviewers that give this 5 stars.  The thing I really like about the CD/album is that it is down to earth hard rock.  If you are a \\"Rock Me Like A Hurricane\\" fan, this CD is not for you.  There is not one bad song on this one.  I love \\"Is There Anybody There?\\" As a matter of fact, all the songs kick.  Yes, Holiday is a slower song but it has that classic Klaus Meine whaling that is the trademark of the Scorps!  Check out Tokyo Tapes, Animal Magnetism, Blackout, In Trance, Virgin Killer, and Hot & Heavy.  These are real Scorpion rock albums.  They are not  for the light of heart \\"Pop\\" rocker.  They are for the true Head Banger!!!!
B00004XPPK|4.0|Like everyone says, this is a very strange story.    It seems to be a love-triangle, but there are more angles than three. For about half the film I thought Glenn Ford was meant to be in love with the Ballin Mundson (Ballin Mundson?) character, because he saved Ford's life (what for?), then gave him a job and was good to him. So far, so odd, but relatively simple to understand. When Rita shows up things become extremely complicated: incomprehensible in fact.  Who had run out on who, and why? I think we should have been told. Was it something to do with Rita's earlier line of work?  A lot of blame was being put on Rita, but so far as I could see she wasn't doing much wrong. Well, maybe just a bit of a tease, but so lovely, sweet and tender you'd forgive her anything. Actually, nobody's motivation here was the slightest bit convincing.  Also, as somebody else has said, the plot reads as if someone put together the pieces left on the cutting-room floor after Casablanca. Anyway, two-thirds into the story,  we get a totally alien sub-plot about conquering the world by cornering the tungsten filament market, which we couldn't care less about, as it has  nothing to do with the tensions between the three main players.  This part is boring and even more unconvincing than the original triangle. The sinister Mr Mundson looked good in his part, but it seemed as if he wasn't being allowed to get his teeth into the role.  Glenn Ford has never impressed me as a personality. He never seems to have what it takes: I can't imagine Rita falling for him, nor can I believe he could take out heavies with his puff-ball punches. I can't even believe he'd behave like the nasty little swine he's supposed to be. So why have I watched this movie two or three times, and why will I watch it again? Only one answer: you said it, folks --- Rita Hayworth.

B000LE1GVW|4.0|I was at a live performance of Paolo recently.  Before this, I had heard his 'new shoes' song on the radio and saw him perform on the Tonight Show.  On the show, his accent was super-thick when he sang; but, there is hardly any accent when you listen to him on this cd.  Not sure why he does that.  Anyway, on to the cd.  <br /> <br />Paolo keeps enough variety going in his songlist so his songs don't sound like one another.  <br />I usually don't purchase a cd unless I like at least three of the songs on it.  Since it was on sale and I could get it autographed, I bought it.  <br />My three favorites on this are: New Shoes, Last Request, and Alloway Grove.  <br />And, if you have the patience to wait a couple minutes of silence, after Alloway Grove there is an acoustic version of Last Request on the cd.  <br />There aren't any songs on the cd that I flat out hated.  I just really like the three that I mentioned.  <br />If you go to his concert, just be prepared for the accent.  Really REALLY thick accent.  :)  <br />
B000HC2PCM|5.0|I really like old country music.  It's much more sincere and real that the current garbage permeating the airwaves.  Merle Haggard is a prime example of that old country music.  He's one of the greatest songwriters to emerge from country music, and his songs are still valid today.  Many people dismiss him as a right wing blowhard because of songs like Okie from Muskogee and The Right Side of Me.  I actually like Okie, and its criticisms of hippie lifestyles is kind of funny and true, considering hippies were silly and naive.  I used to dislike The Right Side of Me, but it's grown on me over the last year, and it's not as jingoistic as I thought.  Even if you don't like these 2 songs because of their (possible) right wing bias, one shouldn't dismiss everything Merle has done over his career because of them.  Merle is a true artist and a complicated man.  The Grateful Dead have covered his songs (most notably Mama Tried, included here), so even the hippie Dead recognized that Merle is a great songwriter, and his political views (which are probably more complicated than most people think) shouldn't matter when it comes to his art.  Personally, I think there's more wisdom in a 3 minute Haggard song (and a Cline and Wiliams one) than in all the political rants of lefties and righties combined.  There was a recent article on Amazon's plog about how people in Seattle were rather rude to him when he was performing, showing that liberals can be closed minded as well.  The biggest surprise here is the duet Merle does with Toby Keith, She Ain't Hooked on Me Anymore.  It's a great song, co-written by Keith himself, and it makes me want to go out and buy some CD's of Toby's.  This is a wonderful collection, featuring many of Merle's greatest, including Mama Tried, Okie from Muskogee, Hungry Eyes, and The Bottle Let Me Down.  Haggard is still going strong today, and his music will go on forever....
B000HEVZ9O|5.0|I really like Mission Impossible III, it was really entertaining. In my opinion it was the best out of all three MI movies.
B0161TTI42|5.0|I should clarify that I'm giving this film five stars for the quality, and not for the message.  Although the message a modern viewer takes away may not be the one that the filmmaker intended.  Beyond anything else, &#34;Triumph of the Will&#34; is a record of the 1934 Nuremburg rally.  Hindenburg had died several months earlier, leaving Hitler as the undisputed sole master of Germany.  The 1934 rally was a mass ritual of adulation for Hitler, and Riefenstahl captures this perfectly.<br /><br />It is all the more remarkable in that while she was given unprecedented access, at the same time this amounted only to where she could place her camera; none of the scenes were choreographed or scripted, or repeated in case she missed anything.  She often shoots subjects from below; this technique was also on display in [[ASIN:B000FQJA2S Olympia]], where it gave the athletes a godlike quality, and here where it does the same for the various Nazi party luminaries.  The fatuous Hermann G&ouml;ring is shown only in profile in a few shots, and is never shown speaking, but most of the speakers, including Hitler, and Rudolf Hess, his eyes bottomless pools of black, are given this treatment.<br /><br />The film begins with title cards indicating that the rally was 16 years after Germany's &#34;humiliation&#34; at the Treaty of Versailles, followed by shots of clouds and the airplane that brought Hitler to the rally as the first head of state to arrive in such a manner.  What follows is a compendium of short excerpts of speeches by various dignitaries, and shots of massed spectators, participants, and marchers.  Most of the tenets of fascism are on display as well - the sense of grievance against enemies without and betrayal by enemies within, the glorification of an imaginary past, national unity and purity, and the belief that greatness can only be achieved through violence.  The joy in the children's faces, an almost religious awe, was unusually poignant as we now know what was in store for them only a few years later.<br /><br />&#34;Triumph of the Will&#34; established Riefenstahl as a master propagandist and a major director.  While I wouldn't refer to the film as a documentary, it inadvertently performs that function despite its blatantly adulatory nature.  Like advertisements in old magazines, it encapsules the time and place it was created in, more than merely pushing a product, as it was originally intended to do.  Eighty years on, it is not only the record of a particular moment in history, but a warning of the danger in placing the entire apparatus of the state under the control of one man.<br /><br />We thought we were done with these things but we were wrong.<br />We thought, because we had power, we had wisdom.<br />We thought the long train would run to the end of Time.<br />We thought the light would increase.<br />Now the long train stands derailed and the bandits loot it.<br />Now the boar and the asp have power in our time.<br />Now the night rolls back on the West and the night is solid.<br />Our fathers and ourselves sowed dragon's teeth.<br /><br />Our children know and suffer the armed men.<br /><br />Stephen Vincent Ben&eacute;t, &#34;Litany For Dictatorships&#34;store for them only a few years later.<br /><br />&#34;Triumph of the Will&#34; established Riefenstahl as a master propagandist and a major director.

B000BNX3B4|2.0|I have noticed that some people have really hated this movie and called it really bad.  I don't think that this is the case.  A really bad movie can still be entertaining because you end up laughing at the movie.  With that in mind, I don't think that Must Love Dogs is a bad movie.  I think it is just mediocre. <br /> <br />There are some bright spots to the movie: my favorite being when Lane's father reads from W.B. Yeats.  The problem is that through most of the rest of the movie, I sat on my couch wondering what the weather was like outside, what I should get my mother for Christmas, and what I should make for supper.  Rarely, if ever, did my attention focus on the movie.  The biggest reason is that I didn't care about the characters.  Given that the leading parts are played by extremely good actors, I have to assume that the movie fell apart in a different place: the direction, the editing, the script, or a combination of all three.  I tend to believe that it is the later.  There are some scenes that are cut off before they can really resonate emotionally.  Other scenes are drug out so long that if you cared about them to begin with, you have totally forgotten why you cared by the time you get to the end. <br /> <br />Ultimately, this had the potential to be an entertaining and enjoyable movie; however, too many things were botched.  If you are a really big Cusack or Lane fan or extremely bored, you might want to pick this up at your local rental store, but I definately would not recommend buying it.  It just isn't a movie that needs to be in anyone's collection.
0439680093|3.0|Despite the theme being very dark, the violence in this book is gratuitous. Minor characters are not well developed.  In the fight between good and evil, the evil ones seem to be all powerful and great in numbers and the few and far between good are either dull, stupid, or naive. Although it reads easily, I would not recommend it for under 8th grade. I certainly wouldn't compare it to any of the Harry Potter series.  It's not that caliber, rather a \\"wannabe\\".
6305205620|1.0|Metallica is great, this product displays them at their near worst.  Pandering to the crowd, playing with the lights on for the first few songs, asking if the crowd wants \\"heavy\\".   Give me a break.  Metallica never needed to do anything but go up on stage and crank the stuff out, so why they resorted to these tactics I don't know.  Other than they are playing to the cameras, which every band does, but this is a little out of character.   I don't understand the glowing reviews here.   I frankly feel the audience got shortchanged and didn't experience a true Metalli-show where it's all black, all music, all fist pumping, all the time.  And the stupid camera-angle-change feature of my DVD didn't work.   More marketing to the masses I suppose.
0767803434|3.0|... USA was the only country in the world where this kind of story (although farfetched) could be happening. Especially when you remember the JFK's fighting history (maybe it's one of the reasons why he was assassinated). But now, when you see the Bush family history, the only war record of the grandfather (at the same time JFK was patrolling in the Pacific) shows his best achievement was building the family's fortune by catering for the Third Reich's financial needs. And I can imagine the present Bush pounding Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on the head with a bible (to show him it's better than the coran), and telling him \\"Get out of my world\\". As well, USA lost all credibility when he got RE-elected : One mistake might be understandable, but, as the Romans said \\"Errare humanum est, sed perseverare diabolicum\\" (to err is human, but to persist is diabolical).
B000089RV6|5.0|What is there to say that the other 180 or so reviewers haven't said about what makes AC/DC's \\"Back In Black\\" so great?!Well,the 2003 remaster here is awesome sonically.While the previous 1994 Atlantic remaster(done by Ted Jensen) sounded tame and timid,Epic's one(done by George Marino)  took it to next level,sounding bassier,ballsier and much truer to the original vinyl verison.In addition,it comes in a attractive digipack containing an entertaining 16-page booklet that contains rare photos,memorabila,press clips and a good essay by noted rock writer David Fricke.You know the rest,so if you are not one the 22 millon who don't already own this timeless classic,click \\"Add To Cart\\" right now!

B00005JMEW|1.0|The only reason why Tarantino has done such a weak films is because he can't do better films. I consider myself a great movie fan. I have been watching films for more than thirty years, so I know what a good film is and I'm sure, \\"Kill Bill I, and Kill Bill II\\", are not good films in any way. Nobody can even call this film alternative, I'm sure this is a complete \\"Nothing\\"! It's a total lack of creativity, ridiculous script, the only one good thing here is the real beauty of Uma Thurman. First time I watched this film I had to watch \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" after to forget the waste of time I had just done. In my opinion Tarantino is the great deceiver of all movie industry. If he had stopped with The great \\"Pulp Fiction\\" he would be considered a genius.
B000000WJZ|5.0|If the Amazon rating doesn't speak for itself (444 independent reviewers), what more do you need?
B000G759LW|5.0|I liked this one even better than I thought I would.  It is definitely PG-13 if not R lyrics-wise, but SO much fun to listen to.  I was impressed that Christina was involved in all of the song-writing, and she leaves Jessica, Mandy, Brittney, et al light-years behind vocally.  Slick way with a lyric, catchy melodies, good merge of classic and modern vibes.

B000IMUYJM|5.0|I bought this with low expectations. I had never heard of it, but I saw it on that \\"100 Scariest Movie Moments\\" show. I figured that if Rob Zombie said it was scary, I should at least check it out. WOW! I loved it! It was not a gorefest and didn't have any sex scenes that were common to 70's horror, but the psycho in this movie is SO DISTURBING. All of his little voices and things really freaked me out! I thought it was a perfect plot, with perfect execution and a perfect ending that was common to many of the 70's classic horror movie genre. As others have said, it was the predecessor to Halloween and many other scary movies, so they all took bits and pieces from this awesome and underrated movie. I fear the remake will not be nearly as good as the original. How can you beat horror perfection? LOVED IT! And if you like great movies that are not jam-packed with senseless gore but freaky nonetheless, watch it!

0312323867|5.0|I read this book in one day, then immediately passed it on to a friend, who loved it as much as I did.  I haven't read [[ASIN:0312321198 Something Borrowed]] yet, but I plan to later today.  Something Blue is fast-paced and fun.  At times Giffin definitely \\"tells\\" instead of \\"shows\\" (if you've taken a fiction writing class, you'll know what I mean) but it doesn't detract terribly from the finished product.  I picked up the book because I was looking for something similar to Marian Keyes' books--light writing that tackles serious subjects.  In this case, the subject matter is the betrayal of a friend.  Darcy's best friend Rachel has stolen her fiance, Dex.  Of course, Darcy isn't a completely innocent victim, but what Rachel did was still inexcusable.  Some reviewers remarked that the changes Darcy made throughout the book were sudden and unrealistic, but I felt that she had been in denial about so many things for so long that once she saw the light, her transformation was destined. <br /> <br />I love Giffin's writing style.  Her real talent is in characterization, which, according to interviews with the author, is also her favorite part of constructing a story.  Overall, Something Blue is a lighthearted yet well-written book with a very satisfying ending.  I can't wait to read Rachel's side of the story, although I have a feeling I won't like her quite as much as I did Darcy.

B000MXPE7O|3.0|I think the subject of the birth of the CIA is very interesting and should make for a killer movie, alas \\"The Good Shepherd\\" is not that. It boasts some very fine actors, eg Damon, Jolie and Baldwin, and the direction of Robert De Niro is fine indeed. Sadly the story is not up to par.  <br /> <br />The story builds up too slowly and at times seems to be going nowhere. The main characters are too low key and thus don't really leave any impression reagardless of who plays them (this is especially true for Damons character). Also Angelina Jolie seems, in my opinion, miscast for the role of a neglected wife. She dosen't look the part to me, and then there's also the same problem as with Matt Damons character: it is too plain. The acting is good enough, the parts are jsut boring. <br />The interesting personas are all confined to minor parts for example the English professor played by Michael Gambon and John Turturros secretary/operative Brocco.  <br /> <br />The movie is also a wee bit long. I think some of the scenes could've been omitted in order to pace the story and make it more tight.  <br /> <br />Still, I think it's worth watching. There are some interesting scenes and some interesting dialogue along the way, definitely. Overall it's just a bit bland, that's all.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|We always expect a lot from music icons, not that they have to prove themselves anymore, but Madonna seems to surprise us time and time again! It's amazing how she is always ahead of times, there are no new artists like her anymore. Her vision to put all the great music, video, dancers, show etc is fantastic. Yes, she works with great talent too, but she has the last word. And she looks half her age, that is a phenomenon on it's own. Her show is brilliant period. We can clearly see why she has become a legend.  <br />I've shown her video from teens to grandpas and also to those who haven't seen her shows since \\"Blond Ambition\\" and they are all in owe to see how awesome her show and music are.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I just bought this movie, I was expecting action and there is no shortage of that.  But where was Q, the wonderful gadgets and cool cars.  Not to mention Bond driving a Ford come on that was sad.  Also, where were the enfamous Bond love scenes, James Bond would never leave a woman to follow some enemy, he would make love to her and then take care of business.  The plot was not the best not mention hard to keep up with. I am so disappointed that I bought this movie instead of renting it.  And finally a blond Bond, he looks like the guy who James beats up and kills, the villian not James Bond.  Find another Sean Connery, or Pierce Bosnan they pull it off.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This CD is exactly what I hoped for, music with some substance. John Mayer's lyrics show maturity and perception with which even a woman in her 50s (I) can identify. Gravity is my new theme song.
B000001DYA|5.0|On this their debut these guys played slower, louder and with more distortion than you ever did.  They named themselves after a very particular form of Owsley's little helper, but you can pretend it was after the laundry detergent.  They will definitely clean out your ears - - no question. What they'll do to the rest of your head is your problem.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Look, I defy anyone to make a cogent argument as to why this CD doesn't have 5 stars. I know classical and jazz musicians who recognize its brilliance.  Other rock musicians recognize its brilliance.  As I sit here listening to it for, like, the 40,000th time, and still am in awe of it, I have to add my two cents in order to try and tip the scales, or stars, a little more in Radiohead's favor. <br /> <br />This is \\"A Love Supreme,\\" \\"Kind of Blue,\\" Beethoven's Fifth, and yes, Sgt. Pepper and Dark Side--- one of those rare events in music that is so breathtaking that it is ensured its endurance forever.  I think that those who don't like it or get it may be unable to get past its extreme moodiness and darkness.  But I don't understand how they are not moved by the intensity of it.  I had tears come to my eyes when I saw them perform \\"The Tourist,\\" and so did a lot of people around me.  It's that moving.  <br /> <br />One of the top ten albums of all time, and I'd listen to any arguments nominating it as number one.
B000HIVO64|5.0|So what if some reviewers are saying that Beck's depressed. I personally think that this is the best thing he's done since \\"Mutations\\", which is my personal favorite.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead-Ok Computer *****<br /><br />Released in 1997 Ok Computer could be the crowning achievement of Radioheads career, well so far anyway. To me Radiohead has yet to make a bad album or Ep. While I do believe Hail To The Thief was average from a band that is capable of so much more, it was still a solid album. Pablo Honey was fantastic, one of the greatest debuts ever. The Bends is fantastic. My Iron Lung Was brilliant, which means Ok Computer and Kid A are genius and amazing, and nothing short of those two terms. Between the two Kid A and Ok Computer it is a toss up as to which is better. Aside from that one thing is for sure Ok Computer is one of the greatest albums of all time. Brilliant use of sounds and effects and fantastic lyrics make this one of the 1990's most sophisticated albums, if not the most. Ok Computer was Radioheads album, the first album where they got everything right. The perfect mix of everything, the harder rock with the softer and the acoustic with the electric as well as the eclectic and the experimental. This truly is one of the finest and most original albums in rock history.<br /><br />Opening with `Airbag' was a wise choice on the bands behalf, as it is one of the strongest tracks on the album and one of the bands very best. With great all around performances by the band and just a fantastic delivery make this a great opener. `Paranoid Android' may be the bands all time best song. While `Creep' will forever be the bands signature, and `My Iron Lung' a strong contender, `Paranoid Android' is with out a doubt the bands best composition. `Johnny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien play some of the best guitar of their career, while Thom Yorke adds very solid ryhtym. The lyrics and vocals are amazing. Colin and Phil lay down a incredible bass and drum combo on this song. `Subterranean Homesick Alien' is along the lines of `Airbag' just not as strong. More cosmic and spacy, and with a killer chorus. `Exit Music (For A Film)' is a wonderfully constructed ballad, if you can even call it that. I'm not sure of how to describe the song, it really must be heard to full understand and appreciate. The same can be said for the next song `Let Down' which is just flat out amazing, and that is really all that can be said about the song. `Karma Police' is going to be considered one of the very best songs of all time in a few years as well as one of the bands all time best. It's already a classic in the Radiohead catalog. The video is classic featuring a man being chased by a car the whole way through while Thome Yorke rides in the car. Radiohead always has the best videos. `Fitter Happier' is just electronic voices of a computer from 1997 when technology was awful in comparison to todays. Actually while most will say it is pointless, but in an album about technology, aliens, and hi-techs it is perfect. `Electioneering' is a stand out on the album. More harder rocking then the rest of the album and features some fantastic guitar playing. The main guitar riff is incredible. `Climbing Up Walls' has really cool production. Really ahead of it's time. When listening to this song it's easy to assume that the band was influenced by the great David Bowie. `No Surprises' is another feature classic from the band. The song had one of the bands biggest and most memorable music videos. Very simple, very cool, and very, very good. One of the albums best songs in fact. `Lucky' is slower with more focus on the vocals and the guitar (both of which are extremely good on this song). If you listen very carefully you can hear one of the best bass lines ever written... `The Tourist' is the albums closer. A great song to do so. With mellow guitar and mood the song eases you out of the album just the right way, leaving you satisfied yet wanting more Radiohead, and counting the days till the next album comes out or until you can by the next addition to your Radiohead collection.<br /><br />With Ok Computer it is easy to see why critics hail Radiohead as this generations guitar band. The three Greenwood, O'Brien, and Yorke form a tirumverote of amazing guitar playing and this album is the reason why the three are held so highly together. As a whole this is one of the strongest albums, as well as one of the greatest albums over all to ever be made in rock and roll history or in all of music history for that matter. This album is  recommend to anyone and everyone who is interested because it offers something for everyone.Radiohead as this generations guitar band.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|\\"Out of 925 recent articles in peer-review scientific journals about global warming, there was no disagreement [that it is occurring].  Zero.\\"<br /><br />The above is just one of the facts you will learn from viewing this Academy Award-winning, riveting, easy-to-understand, and surprisingly non-boring documentary about climate change, specifically global warming.  It features former U.S. vice-president Al Gore standing on a stage before a large screen lecturing to an audience.<br /><br />Generally, Gore reviews:<br /><br />(1) the scientific evidence for global warming (he has access to many scientists)<br />(2) the politics of global warming<br />(3) the economics of global warming<br />(4) its consequences (those happening now and those that are predicted)<br /><br />There seems to be some confusion as to what exactly the contents of this film entails.  To alleviate this problem, I will give the title of each scene below and where I feel it is necessary, a comment in parenthesis:<br /><br />(1)  The river (this is one item in an introductory sequence)<br />(2)  Continental drift (at one time major land masses were together but slowly drifted apart)<br />(3)  Basic science of global warming (\\"traditional explanation\\")<br />(4)  Global warming cartoon (\\"better explanation\\")<br />(5)  Professor Revelle (first person who proposed to measure carbon dioxide (a major culprit causing global warming) concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere.  Gore attended classes given by Revelle)<br />(6)  Carbon Dioxide measures since 1958<br />(7)  Glaciers receding (around the world)<br />(8)  Ice cores (can be used to measure carbon dioxide concentrations for a particular year in the past)<br /><br />(9)  Carbon dioxide levels back 650 thousand years<br />(10)  *Albert's accident (Gore's son)<br />(11)  Rising temperatures<br />(12)  Hurricanes (as well as tornadoes and typhoons)<br />(13)  *2000 election (Gore versus Bush)<br />(14)  Precipitation and Evaporation (these are increasing and relocating due to global warming)<br />(15)  *The Gore farm<br />(16)  The Arctic (predictor of global warming)<br /><br />(17)  The ocean conveyer (responsible for heat transfer)<br />(18)  *Resistance to change (humans find it difficult to change their ways)<br />(19)  Troubling signs (of global warming)<br />(20)  Antarctica (another predictor of global warming)<br />(21)  Sea-level rise<br />(22)  *China (contrary to what you may hear, China is doing its part to curb global warming)<br />(23)  (Human) population explosion (puts pressure on Earth's resources)<br />(24)  Old habits + new technology (= dramatically altered consequences)<br /><br />(25)  *Working tobacco<br />(26)  Is there (really) a controversy (with regard to global warming)?  (Gore talks about skeptics who want to \\"reposition global warming as a debate\\")<br />(27)  Science fraud (just like that which perpetuated the myth that smoking cigarettes does not cause lung cancer)<br />(28)  Balancing the economy and environment (or money versus the Earth)<br />(29)  *City by city (Gore goes to cities around the world with his message)<br />(30)  The solutions are in our hands (to solve the problem of global warming)<br />(31)  Are we (humans) capable of doing great (environmental) things?<br />(32)  Our only home (the planet we call------EARTH)<br /><br />(*These items are personal in nature.)<br /><br />Gore is an engaging person thus making this documentary (on a serious subject) a treat to watch.  The pictures, graphs, animation, etc. that appear on the screen behind Gore are well done and illustrate exquisitely each point he's making.<br /><br />The accompanying book of the same title is more detailed than the documentary.  The book reached #1 on the New York Times bestseller list in July 2006.<br /><br />The film's distributor, \\"Paramount Classics,\\" is donating 5% of the box office receipts and Gore is donating all his proceeds from this film to \\"The Alliance for Climate Protection.\\"  Also,this was the third highest documentary at the U.S. box office (at the time this review was written).<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2006) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has many interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, I want to leave you with the words of the late, great Dr. Carl Sagan that I feel summarize Al Gore's fascinating documentary:<br /><br />\\"Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.  [To see that the Earth is truly a \\"speck,\\" refer to the picture of the Earth as seen from about 3.5 billion miles by the Voyager 1 spacecraft.  Gore includes this astonishing picture both in this documentary and his book.]  In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.<br /><br />The Earth is the only world we know so far to harbor life.  There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which [the human] species could migrate.  Visit yes.  Settle, not yet.  Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we must make our stand.\\"<br /><br />(...)this was the third highest documentary at the U.S. box office (at the time this review was written).<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2006) is perfect in picture and sound quality.

B000002OZY|5.0|The Who-Tommy*****<br /><br />The Who's Tommy could quite possible be the greatest album of all time, in fact I would go so far as to say it is the greatest album of all time. No other album in history has been able to tell a story so beautifully and so perfectly it would make William Shakespeare blush. This album once and for all proved that Pete Townshend was not just a mere lyricist or songwriter but a composer of rock and roll masterpieces.<br /><br />His lyrics and vocals are spectacular throughout especially through songs like the brilliant `1921' and `It's A Boy.' The imagination behind songs like `Go To The Mirror' and the sharp lyrics of `Christmas' Undoubtably rank Townshend among music's best lyricists. Lets not forget the masterful guitar played by the man. This was the first album to really solidify Townshend as a guitar God, especially on tracks like `Sparks' and `Christmas,' and lets not forget the killer intro on `Pinball Wizard'. Roger Daltry's power vocals and sometimes screams are absolutely over the top, as if his good looks don't help his appeal, but that's another story. John Entwistle who not only played some of the best bass of his life but he also lent lyrics to some of the albums great songs like `Cousin Kevin' and `Fiddle About,' honestly this album would be nothing without Entwistle. Keith Moon plays drums as only Keith Moon knows how which is completely out of this world. This album helps to prove once and for all that Moon is the all greatest drummer in the history of playing. The Who are truly one of the greatest bands of all time and this album shows it more then any other because of the interaction between the four counter parts.<br /><br />The story of a deaf, dumb, and blind kid is one of the craziest most outlandish ideas for a premise of and album I have ever heard, but it is also one of the best I have ever heard, if not the best. When this album was originally released in the 1960's the subject matter of being blind, deaf, and dumb was very taboo. Not to mention the thought of a song about a boy who was molested by his uncle then went on to become a joke religious leader was enough to outrage most of the world resulting in The Who being banned from the BBC in England and from many states in the United States not to mention the ban from almost all of the radio stations in the country at the time. When first buying this album I thought with a reputation like this, Tommy better be one of the best damn albums I will ever hear, and it was the greatest album I had ever heard.<br /><br />This is one of the best, and strongest albums in all of rock and roll history, not to mention music history. The subject matter is not for the timid, it is truly a work of art which should be heard by all. So for my final verdict this is one album I recommend to the entire world., and dumb was very taboo.

B000MGUZMU|5.0|This album is in no way Funeral pt. 2. It sounds completely different, which means these guys and gals are as talented (actually more) than we thought all along. This album reminds me of a lot of things, as you see in these varied reviews, but the great thing is that you can't exactly place it. And it only reminds me of things I love. <br /> <br />Wonderfully crafted and detailed, it takes multiple listens, as did Funeral, for this album to get under your skin. But when it does, it does.  <br />
B000H5U65C|5.0|Mastodon-Blood Mountain*****<br /><br /> Metal is back, real metal has finally returned and has done so with a vengeance. More then just metal this is one album that knows no bound, reaching into Progressive Rock, Classic Rock, Thrash, and just straight up Rock And Roll. The attitude when needed is unparalleled by any other band around right now, and the moments of sensitivity are fantastically balanced with the intensity. Brann Dailor plays some of the best drums you have ever heard in your entire life on Blood Mountain, the fervor of the mans kit is insane. Troy Sanders lays down some of the fattest bass lines I've ever heard, also some of the intensest vocals in metal history. The guitars played by Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher is the most creative guitar playing the genre has seen in almost fifteen years and it is so refreshing to hear. The lyrical matter on the album is very early Slayer but much more sophisticated.<br /><br /> The story of the band parking at the bottom of Blood Mountain and attempting to climb to the top and reach the Crystal Skull before they catch frostbite and are ate by the sleeping giant, cysquatch. If that sounds insane to you and like one of the most off the wall premises for and album then you wouldn't be far off, either that of you have never heard a real metal album before. Songs like the incendiary `The Wolf Is Loose' which opens the album and capillarian Crest' provide what metal has been missing for the last few years (with the exception of Trivium, and Lamb Of God), and that is balls. The album opener is easily the best song Mastodon has ever written and recorded. Slower more melodic tracks like the brilliant `Bladecatcher' and the beautiful(yes beautiful yet brutal) album closer `Pendulous Skin' so that there is more to Mastodon then in your face-destructive metal, much more. The complicated rhythms of this album show the musical prowess of each of the players and this is none more present then on `Circle Of Cysquatch.'<br /><br /> With Led Zeppelin and Animals era Pink Floyd as major influences on the making of this record it's easy to see understand why this album is such a killer one. `Sleeping Giant' recalls Houses Of The Holy Led Zeppelin and sounds almost totally influenced by `No Quarter.' With more of a slow melodic melody and less in your face screaming this song makes for one of the best and most original song the band has ever recorded. The influences of outside genres helped to make this a more interesting album and one that will be easy to listen to over and over again.<br /><br /> In closing I would like to thank the members of Mastodon for making metal smart again, for helping to bring back the guitar solo, and the all mighty guitar riff, for with out it metal is nothing, for putting the spotlight back on the drummer, for making the younger bands realize that unless the bass is heard it is pointless, and finally for making what could be the best metal album of the last ten years.r /> <br /> With Led Zeppelin and Animals era Pink Floyd as major influences on the making of this record it's easy to see understand why this album is such a killer one. `Sleeping Giant' recalls Houses Of The Holy Led Zeppelin and sounds almost totally influenced by `No Quarter.'

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Saw this movie for the first time this weekend and was amazed at how GOOD it was!!! I was skeptical of whether Craig could pull it off, but now I am a real fan.  This is right up there with the best bond films of old.  The acting is great for an action film, the plot good, the action good, and a just a good overall story!
B00002MVQR|4.0|Sandinista!-The Clash ****<br /><br />Punk, Post-punk, Proto-punk,Rockabillie, Dub, Dance, Childrens, Reggea, Doo-Whop, Motown, New Wave, Waltz, it is all here if you name The Clash provides it here. Sandinista! is the album where Joe Strummer and Mick Jones have an identity crisis, and in my opinion it pays off. The Clash try everything here and for the most part they do it well, give or take a few missteps. Mick Jones is using every guitar effects-pedal imagenable to him at this point. Topper and Paul are so out of their minds on herion and everything else at the time that they are just going along with the flow while Strummer or should I say Stalin is taking this band in every direction other then where they started out to go which is fine. You know why The Clash are one of if not the greatest band of all time....it's becasue they dared, they dared to grow and do it. The Clash are what every other band wishes they could be because they knew no boundries and they did what they thought was cool, or good, or what ever other word you want to use. They did what they did because to them at the time it felt right.<br /><br />This triple album has been turned into a double cd which is great because it saves the consumers money and you dont lose any of the songs. The Clash actually almost got thrown off their record company because they faught to have this sold at a cheaper price then a single album, gotta love that.<br /><br />The first disc of the album is arguably the better side. The better selection of songs is on this disc and the amount of good songs is greater on this disc. 'The Magnificent Seven' which is magnificent opens the albums and does so superbly. One of the best songs on the album. 'Junco Partner' is a killer reggea track done masterfully by the only white boys that ever did the genre any justice. 'Ivan Meets G.I. Joe' is a dub dance club hit and a great song. It's about when Joe Strummer met a Russian named Ivan and they managed to make a hit song about it. 'Hitsville U.K.' is a great motown/doo-whop song that is about Hitsville U.S.A. only in the U.K. and superisingly it sounds really good, who know the Brits could do Motown? 'Somebody Got Murdered' is one of the best tracks ont he album and easily the best on the first disc. It is very nostolgic of the London Calling album. 'If Music Could Talk' is another great song with a great concept behind it that has to be heard to be appreciated. While clearly that is not all of the songs on the first disc those are the tracks that stand out the most. 'One More Dub' is one song that could have been left off of the album because it is the exact same song as the one before it 'One More Time' exept not as good.<br /><br />While disc one is the better disc, the second one is still very good. Infact it contains the two best songs on the album and two of the bands all time best. The first is the cover song that opens the second disc, 'Police On My Back' this is one of the very best songs I have ever heard, and that is the original, but The Clash manage to make it even better, and into a true classic and into one of the bands all time best.The vocals are phenomonal, and the arrangement is out of this world. Later on the album offers 'Charlie Don't Surf' which is the second best song on the album. About Vietnam and is just so laid back and wonderful. Clearly one of the top five songs the band has ever made. 'The Equaliser' is a great song as is 'Midnight Log' the songs are quite simillar. 'The Call Up' is a nice song but could have been stronger. 'Washington Bullets' was a minor hit for the band and was a concert favorite and with one listen you will hear why.'Version City' is another one of those songs that are just so good you can't believe the band really came up with it. Now I must say the new alternate version of 'Career Opportunities' is awful. Truly a waste of space on the album. It is turned into a nursery ryhme which kills the whole entire meaning of hte original song.<br /><br />Sandinista! is a melting pot for all sorts of different musical styles and songs. It is also one of the single greatest pieces of music in the history of rock n' roll. With this album The Clash proved that they were second to none and that they were capable of anything musicaly and taking over the world to become the biggest band in the world would be just around the corner if only they could keep their ego's under control.l song. <br /> <br />Sandinista! is a melting pot for all sorts of different musical styles and songs.

0061122092|4.0|I read this book after reading Coelho's, The Alchemist.  It is not as rich a story as The Alchemist but still worth reading.  Coelho excels at writing his novels from a philosophical perspective.  The two main characters have major life decisions to make and he does a fabulous job of taking the reader through the character's philosophical reasoning as to why they make the decisions they make.  I truly enjoyed this book and plan to read more of Coelho's work.

The only thing that irritated me was the fact that Sharon Stone was portrayed as this drug obsessed person who kept going back to her loser ex.  I mean who wouldn't choose Robert DeNiro?  Well anyways, it was interesting to see that in the end things don't always go as expected.  I definitely recommend this movie!

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale definitely leaves a mark in the mind of all those who watch it, whether you're a Bond fan or not. Personally, Casino Royale has made it into my Bond top 5 with the likes of Goldfinger and From Russia with Love.<br /><br />This is a James Bond reset, putting the audience in the view of Bond as a brand new double-0. To see Bond develop in Casino Royale was quite a spectacle since James Bond may be one of the least developed long-time Hollywood characters. The most emotion anyone may have ever had for Bond would have been back in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.<br /><br />In addition to great development of both character and plot (plot is always the key to a good Bond film), Daniel Craig absolutely blew my socks off with his performance! Next to Sean Connery, Daniel Craig may perhaps be the best Bond yet. I am an avid fan of all the Bond actors (yes, even Roger Moore when I'm not considering Moonraker), and Daniel Craig really stands out. Hopefully, Craig will go on to make a few more excellent and noteworthy Bond films to add to this fun series.<br /><br />And for those who could care less about Bond, Casino Royale is, put simply, the best action film of 2006. Great bad guys, amazing stunts, exciting story, high tension, etc. It's all one could ever ask for. The story entails a VERY high stakes Texas Hold 'em tournament (although we all know poker was not Bond's game of choice, it is an appropriate update for the new generation Bond), deceit, greed, politics, and of course a little bit of old-fashioned Bond romance.<br /><br />And lastly, a very important note, the Bond girls in Casino Royale are absolutely unforgettable. Eva Green gives a memorable performance, and was perfect playing opposite Daniel Craig. Having seen her in Kingdom of Heaven prior to this, I was very excited (for good reason) to see her in Casino Royale. If I haven't given you enough reasons to purchase this, I don't know what else to tell you.

B000JJRIN4|3.0|I'm usually a big fan of Gwen but I was not impressed with this album.I only like the song \\"Wind it up\\".The rest of the cd makes me want to cringe because it's so annoying.Espescially the song \\"The Sweet Escape\\".She could have done better collaborations for the album,Although Pharrell was great for his appearance in the song \\"Yummy\\".Overall,I'm not thrilled with Gwen's latest album.
B00005JPMC|3.0|After long years in the back burner, author Stephen Hunter's laconic, sharpshooting hero, Bob Lee Swagger, comes to the big screen, finally, in SHOOTER. Based on Hunter's 1993 techno-thriller of a book POINT OF IMPACT, this film, however, makes Swagger over from a middle-aged Vietnam vet to a much younger Marine Corps Gunny Sergeant plying his sniping trade in these more contemporary times.<br /><br />PLOT SPOILERS begin and never really end:<br /><br />The picture opens with Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and best friend/spotter Donnie out on a military op in Ethiopia. As usual with things of this sort, the operation becomes another instance of a mission gone horribly wrong as Swagger and Donnie end up being abandoned by their home base and Donnie mortally buys a bunch of bullets. Cut to three years later, where a disillusioned and now ponytailed Swagger has retired from the Marines and has become a recluse living in the Wyoming wilds. His preferred company is a dog talented enough to fetch him a cold one from the fridge.<br /><br />But the government comes a'callin' in the form of the very self-assured Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover), who tells Swagger that because of certain governmental leaks, the President's safety is now compromised. Johnson wants Swagger to scope out the President's upcoming multi-city tour and come up with the most likely scenario for an assassination. Swagger is initially disinclined, but the colonel knows the right buttons to push and plays on Bob Lee's patriotism until Swagger caves in. To cut to the chase here, Swagger does come up with an assassination scenario and - BAM! - is promptly shot and framed for the fatal shooting of the archbishop, who had stood next to the president. The rest of the film has to do with Swagger as he channels his inner Rambo to administer to his own wounds and then gets his trigger-happy vengeance on.<br /><br />TRAINING DAY director Antoined Fuqua delivers a polished and sometimes exciting action movie here. There are several thrilling sequences where you just can't help but root for Swagger as he shows up like an avenging angel and kicks copious villainous booty. The wild shootout in the backwoods of Virginia and the showdown in the snow are two very gripping sequences. And, yes, Swagger does remind me quite a bit of Jason Bourne, another anti-hero from literature. Not that that's a bad thing.<br /><br />Here's the not so positive stuff: SHOOTER does suffer from a decided lack of originality. We've seen this premise before with its weary plot elements, about a man who is framed and, now, it's become him against the world (again, you don't have to go any further than the BOURNE films). *Sigh* even after all these years, Hitchcock still does it best. This time, the \\"twist\\" is that the man implicated is a long range marksman (but who can wreak close range havok if need be, with or without weapons). There's some stuff about the nuances of sniping, of how the Corealis effect and the wind and calculating distance and such actually do play a crucial part. I do find the opening bits between Swagger and his spotter buddy quite involving as that sequence somewhat breaks down what goes on between a sniper and his spotter during a mission. But, overall, when it comes to the lowdown on sniperology, the movie SNIPER does it better.<br /><br />What sucks is that we have to wade thru another muddied conspiracy, this time centering on oil pipelines and the massacre of an African village, the intricacies of which I couldn't have cared less. The villains are boring. We have a smug, seemingly untouchable lead villain (\\"I win, you lose!\\"), an over-the-top psycho underling (Elias Koteas), and a (gasp!) crooked senator (Ned Beatty). And, of course, a mob of second-hand minions who are no match for Swagger's solo but righteous act and are mowed down with ridiculous ease. Kate Mara (ZOOM, WE ARE MARSHALL) is here because you have to have a hot chick even if she's playing the second fiddle, eye-candyrole of the not-so-grieving widow. Kate is very beautiful and she tries, but her scenes with Wahlberg, the scenes that should count the most, are lukewarm. It doesn't help that nothing happens between them, on-screen anyway. There's one moment when I thought things would develop to the next level, but, then, phfft...nothing. I don't know how long Swagger was recovering in Sarah's home but she went from uncertainty to acceptance to staunchily aiding and abetting the dude in a seemingly inordinate amount of time. Ah, platonic love...<br /><br />The good news is that Michael Pena (CRASH) is very good as Nick Memphis, the young but lowly FBI agent who comes to suspect that not all is as it seems. In his further investigations, Memphis proves to be dogged and perceptive, to the point where he becomes noticed by the wrong people in the department. Believing that he's going to be fired because of a prior slip up (as shown in the film), he persists anyway. The good news for him is that this persistence also gets him noticed by Swagger, who eventually comes to see him as an ally. As Memphis, Pena is funny and frustrated, fearful and savvy, suspicious and smart. Not too surprisingly, his character is imbued with more personality than Swagger, who, at times, seems to be nothing more than a killing machine.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee Swagger does his best, and it's sure good enough. He doesn't get any showy emoting moments here, other than maybe during his ministrations to his wounds, wherein the viewer fully empathizes with the agony and desperation undergone by the character. But, let's face it, Bob Lee Swagger is supposed to be low key and taciturn, a simple man who's crafty in certain ways. But, irregardless, Wahlberg is convincing in the part, or as convincing as you're gonna get, given the outrageous storyline. When called for in his scenes, Marky Mark shows off a certain no-nonsense intensity and ruthlessness that befit the character. I like it, what he does in this role.<br /><br />One can't help but wonder how Tommy Lee Jones would've fared as Bob Lee Swagger. Tommy Lee Jones was originally slated to play Bob Lee Swagger, and, to be honest, as much as I like Mark Wahlberg, Jones would've been ideal. For those who haven't read the books, Swagger is actually written as a southern hick. Wahlberg sidesteps that issue (or, at least, I didn't notice a southern accent), but Tommy Lee Jones, who not only is closer in age to the book version of Swagger but, with his country drawl and sensibilities, would've definitely played up the hillbilly aspect. And, not to put down Wahlberg's acting chops - which is improving all the time - but Jones is the better actor of the two. Oh, well...As a substitute, Wahlberg is a very do-able choice.<br /><br />Three stars for this one, a film that has its moments but becomes ultimately bogged down in its own hackneyed trappings. If you liked this film but haven't yet read the book it was based on, then definitely check out the novel [[ASIN:0553563513 Point of Impact]] (which is better than the movie) and its two sequels [[ASIN:044022313X Black Light]] (1996) and [[ASIN:0440226457 Time to Hunt]] (1998).

B000NA28IE|1.0|This horrendous screen adaptation of Christopher Paolini's brilliant work deviates so far from the book it's practically unrecognizable.  I see the majority of reviewers here and other places like Netflix who gave it a good rating did not read the book, which is fortunate for them, because if you've read it, watching this movie will make you want to pull your hair out. <br /> <br />About the only similarities between the movie and the book are the names of the characters and the fact that it, indeed, features a dragon. <br /> <br />One reviewer tried to defend this film by stating they did the best they could with a 470 page book, but the Harry Potter books are far longer and while they may have to cut a lot of the storyline out of those movies, they still manage to keep it within JK Rowling's vision.   <br /> <br />Watching Eragon, one of the things I just could not get past enough to tolerate this movie, let alone enjoy it, was the fact the Saphira sounds like a teenage girl, or even sometimes a sexy young vixen.  I was expecting a dragon to sound a little more....well, \\"dragon-like\\"...a little more \\"other-worldly.\\"  And because Eragon and Saphira communicate telepathically, I was expecting the dialogue between them to have it's own unique sound as well...something that would make it obvious to the viewers that what was being said could only be heard between the two of them. I mean, come on!  Movie makers have been doing this for decades: Such as when a character in a movie is thinking something in his head that none of the other characters can hear... Would that have been so difficult?  The fact that the film-makers couldn't even pay this much attention to such an obvious aspect of this movie gives you an idea of how much else they didn't bother with. <br /> <br />The only thing they got right was to cast Jeremy Irons as Brom.  The character who played Eragon was easy on the eyes, but he really needs some more acting lessons....or maybe just a better script.  AndI will admit that the special effects people behind Saphira did a good job.  She may not sound like a dragon, but she indeed looks like one. <br /> <br />My 8-year-daughter was so disappointed in this movie she was ready to chuck the DVD out the window before I stopped her, and she is really NOT hard to please.  In fact, I think this is probably the first movie she hasn't liked. <br /> <br />I will be amazed if these same film makers have the nerve to make more movies from the rest of the Inheritance series.  I think we'd all be better off if someone ELSE tried re-making THIS one first before moving on to any sequels.
1596680199|5.0|IMPORTANT FOR INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS    Before I do this review, International Customers need to check this book. It is also sold under a different ISBN - Title: How to Make Polymer Clay Beads, has a completely different cover and publisher. It also retails cheaper - in Australia for instance it's full retail in AUD19.95. I have BOTH copies and they are identical books. It also has a completely different cover in the UK - making it three \\"versions\\" - how to confuse customers.. Now to the review........      I am often asked by cash strapped students, if you had to pick one, what do you recommend....this is it. Carol Blackburn has set out to clearly show you how to make beads in every shape, form, style and faux technique that you could imagine, and she has succeeded. Commencing with an excellent intro, very handy for newcommers to PC, she covers all materials and techniques that you would want to know, Caning, Colour Mixing, Stacking, Applique, Inlay, Transfers, Rubber Stamping. Mokume Gane and Mica shift are just a few of those covered.     She then moves onto Faux Techniques, absolute winners, each and every one, and with 16 of them you would be hard pressed to not find some you liked. In particular the coral, amber, Abalone and Veined Marble were brilliant.     You are then taken to an area that many books fail to deliver - bringing it all together. Understanding tools, finishing techniques, jewellery findings and what works well with what. Finishing with a very nice gallery indeed.     What makes the book extra special. Brilliant clear photographs that actually show you the technique, not leave you guessing. Logical sequence, clear written instructions and fabulous examples of completed work. All very wearable and contemporary - no glitzy or cutesy bits here. The final winning element came with loads of tips sprinkled through the pages.     This book is a veritable one stop shop, sure it's title is beads and it does an excellent job of focusing on the diversityof beads, but this is also about technique, and you can use any of the techniques shown on any polymer creation. This is definitely one book that will be highly recommended to my students.

B000FVQM2Y|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />You at least gotta give `em points for trying.<br /><br />That's about the best that can be said for the people who made \\"Brick,\\" an ambitious, though ultimately misguided, attempt to set a film noir drama on a contemporary high school campus.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt - who, in \\"Mysterious Skin,\\" delivered one of the best film performances of 2005 - is here completely miscast as a tough-talking teen investigating the  death of his beloved ex-girlfriend, most likely at the hands of some local drug dealers.  In all fairness to Gordon-Levitt, however, it should be pointed out that in \\"Skin,\\" he was called upon to play a real life person with real life feelings and emotions, which he did to perfection.  In \\"Brick,\\" the character is anything BUT real; rather, he is a deliberately artificial construct designed by writer/director Rian Johnson to move the plot along and to enhance the film noir atmosphere.  Yet, there is something inherently ludicrous in having modern teens speaking in the clipped phrasing and arch wordiness typical of 1940's film noir characters.  Actors like Bogart, Lancaster and Widmark didn't just have their tough-guy status conferred on them; they had to earn it, through the kind of wisdom and gravitas that come only with age and a life composed largely of hard knocks, both physical and psychological.  We always understood that it was the baggage they brought with them from their previous lives that made them what they were today.  Lacking this life experience, the characters in \\"Brick,\\" on the other hand, go through the motions, but always eliciting the nagging impression in us that they are merely playing dress-up (if not literally, at least metaphorically), a fact which drains the film itself of vitality and relevance.  To put it more bluntly and succinctly, we simply don't care.<br /><br />It doesn't help that the story itself is convoluted and not particularly compelling, or that the acting is stiff and deliberately one-note in nature (not the fault of the actors, I must add).  Moreover, it's rather inexplicable as to why this high school seems strangely bereft of teachers and classrooms.  On the positive side, Johnson and cinematographer Steve Yedlin do bring an appropriately stark and ominous look to the normally cheery, antiseptic Southern California suburban backdrop against which the drama takes place.<br /><br />Perhaps by the time they all get together for their 20th high school reunion, the characters will have grown into their roles.  Till then, I'll stick with film noir dramas that are by, about and for grownups.ly one-note in nature (not the fault of the actors, I must add).

B000N3SS80|4.0|I always felt that her latin language songs in the past were good and she should consider working on an all latin album someday. I'm glad she finally realized that dream. The only thing that I was a bit disappointed by was that there were no fast paced songs which in the past worked so well for her. Not even a track like Carino. Too many ballads! <br />But I will say that she's never sounded before this confident as a singer. Although at times it seems like it's not good enough. But the woman delivered her best!  <br />I will dare to say that this is her most consistent album to date.

0393327655|2.0|Ultimately this is a thinly disguised right-wing rant that supports intolerance of religion in general and an atheistic crusade against all Muslims in particular:<br /><br />\\"Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them.\\" p.52-3<br /><br />\\"The only thing that seems likely to persuade most Muslims that their worldview is problematic is the demonstrable failure of their societies.\\" p.133<br /><br />Goes to show that denying religion does not automically give your arguments objectivity, much less any moral value.

B000A7Q2DM|3.0|For those that think that \\"30 Seconds to Mars\\" is complete genius with complex song-writing and building on progressive sounds from the 70's and 80's, you might want to take that musical theroy class ASAP! \\"30 Seconds to Mars\\" is none of the above, but that isn't a bad thing. I have seem them all over TV and magazines lately, but since they have been popping up all over CDNOW evertime I log on, I had to see what all the fuss was about. Just by their looks alone, I was thinking that they were going to be like the other 1000 bands that are out there today, that dont have an one bit of talent, and clutter the airwaves with their bubblegum lolly dahh so-called music.I was hoping to give them a good whipping on this review, just like all the other punk/pop bands that I despise. \\"30 seconds to Mars\\" surprised me, and I was finding them very easy to listen to with some catchy tunes and some good pop rock. (this isnt even close to Metal or even NU Metal so please dont call them that) A real surprise, and even though they arent the most talented musicans in the world, they do seperate themselves from the other junk in this genere, by using clean vocal styles and keeping their sound (even though simple) a bit different then the hundreds of other bands that they stand before. You want to hate them, but you just cant, because this is a pretty decent listen, and you might find yourself hooked, even though you dont want to be. It isnt perfect, as there is some filler on here, but a slightly above average band is a good thing, when the pop musical scene is caught in the sewer.

B000H7JD4A|4.0|Bruce is sounding a little hoarse, and the songs are a little too repetative for my taste.  I don't think it has the spark of Iron Maiden or Killers.  But I listen to this CD more than any Maiden release since Live After Death, and I like it better than Somewhere in Time or Seventh Son.  Its consistent all the way through, unlike many Maiden albums that to my taste have 4 or 5 good songs and then filler.  The songs are mature, well written, and fairly interesting for the most part.
B00005LC1H|1.0|The Fawlty Towers episodes are hilarious and deserve their growing cult status.  However, this DVD set is poor quality and not recommended.  The problem is the compression used in order to fit the series on three DVDs:  the frame-rate has been significantly reduced.  This would be mostly unnoticeable on a slow moving film, but there is considerable amounts of fast movement in Fawlty Towers, so the result is a very distracting, jerky effect where actors magically jump from one position to the next.  There is also a graining quality to the image that suggests other types of compression.  What's the point of a DVD when the VHS delivers better viewing?

0060899220|5.0|When I bought this book, I was not too sure what to expect. What I got was an excellent read - though not one for the faint of heart! With stories this incredible, they could only be true.<br /><br />As the title says, it takes you to the underbelly of the cooking world ... the lowest scraping underbellies! We take a trip down memory lane with Chef Bourdain - time spent cooking for Summer jobs; his stint at the CIA; his career and travels following that. These stories have some incredible, quite eye-opening, details that do make you wonder about the wisdom of dining anywhere else but at home. But, they also tempt you to test these details (order fish on Sunday; ask for something well-done while someone else at your table requests the same item medium-rare, etc.).<br /><br />The massive drug usage is quite disturbing when one thinks that these people are preparing your meal ... how do they survive without putting severed pieces of themselves - or others - in the meal?<br /><br />If you have ever been in a commercial kitchen; you will understand the prolific amount of swearing ... too many over-worked people in a small, cramped, damnably hot, space under incredible time constraints. This - and the sex - makes the book a no-no for the young or dainty-minded.<br /><br />Chef Bourdain's stories have excellent cooking tips, tool tips, etc., which added to the five star recommendation. I gave this book to my Mother (who is 83) and she enjoyed it; the next recipient is my nephew who is in his first year at the CIA ... I do believe he might appreciate this now that he has some of the training under his belt.<br /><br />Kudos to Chef Bourdain for taking the time to write this book to let the other side see what it is he does ... and does so well.
0895260131|1.0|This light, breezy and easy-to-read introduction to Islam is a shocking and dishonest distortion of Islamic culture and history.  The author relies upon selections from serious and far-from-serious books on Islam to present an unbalanced and devastatingly hateful image of Muslims.  It's not that there are no grains of truth to Mr. Spencer's book, but they come packaged with half-truths, misrepresentations and an astonishing amount of venom.  If you are looking for a book to close your mind and succumb to hatred, then seek no further! However, if you want to rise to the challenge of understanding the different cultures in our sadly battered world, then give this vicious polemic a miss.  Remember: The Peacemaker Never Lost.  And Mr. Spencer is not a peacemaker.<br /><br />P.S.  Anyone with an ounce of Christian values will want to read Steve Bell's Grace for Muslims?:  The Journey from Fear to Faith after this dreadful dirge.

There are too many characters to describe here but all are well detailed in the book and you are drawn into their stories with each page.<br /><br />There are parts of this book which are truly hilarious and a box of tissues is a good idea if you tend to cry when you laugh very hard! The story is a wonderful \\"good versus evil\\" one, though in the end, most of them seem to win and go on with their rather unusual lives.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly if you want a wonderful laugh and charming story that keeps moving along at a good pace.
B000GFLE86|5.0|I had heard Madeleine Peyroux's voice very briefly several months ago, and it really made me perk up my ears.  I HAD to find out who that was!  I was really tickled when I found her album when wandering around Amazon, and have been really pleased with it.  She has a really great quirky voice and a comforting rhythm that send me way back to - I don't know - the forties, maybe?  Peyroux isn't pop - not enough people will get it - but I know I'll watch avidly for new albums from her.
0790731452|4.0|I've always loved this movie, the special effects are incredible and the cast surprised me (I didn't know Jack Black was in this movie until recently). I always liked the way they made the movie very retro looking, since it was based on trading cards from 1960's. If you're into wacky sci-fi comedies, I HIGHLY recommend Mars Attacks! It's a shame there are no extras on this DVD, but the movie is worth getting, especially at under $10.
B000NA28IE|1.0|Okay, Amazon really needs to add an option for people to give items a zero-star rating. While I loved the book and eagerly awaited the movie, I have to say that this movie really sucked, and at some points, it was laughable (and if you've read the book, you know this isn't a comedy). <br /> <br />This has to be the absolute WORST adaptation ever done, and Christoper Paolini should have the option to fire the entire creative team that turned his book into a disgusting piece of trash. The book was around 400 pages, and the movie was only about 90 minutes, so I'll let you do the math on trying to figure out how much of the book they were actually able to retain and do the storyline justice. Answer: Not much. <br /> <br />With the right script and adaptation of the original manuscript, this could have been a really good movie. The book had so much potential, but none of that translated into the movie. If I had a choice of buying this DVD and some version of \\"Elmo's World,\\" I would probably get the Elmo disc, because at least _that_ is supposed to be funny. <br /> <br />Save your cash. Don't buy this DVD, and certainly don't rent it, even on NetFlix.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I think \\"Matilda\\" is one of the sweetest movies ever. There is lots of different emotions throughout this flick that will have you , laughing, crying, scared, and heart-touched. A great family movie that every one should have in their collections.
6305511055|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Reading the list of actors tells you this one is special and they all deliver. Calling the plot clever is an understatement, to say the least. You have to pay attention to stay in the story, and if you do, it will be over before you want it to stop, it's that good. Like me, you will long remember Faith Dunaway's response to Robert Redford's request from her for another assist in his unraveling of a most diabolical plot, when she asks,\\"Have I ever denied you anything?\\"  They don't come any better.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|This is by far the best packaging I have seen for the original, and in my opinion, best Batman movie to date. The original creation of Batman as intended to be dark and be mysterious which this movie mastered very well. The creator of the original story and comic book charecter, Bob Kane, was on set during the making of this film. I was pleased to run into this 2-Disc collection of Batman by accident, as it serves the film well.<br /><br />The bonus features are numerous. I like the features that introduce the charecter of Batman, the creator, and the evolution of the comic strip charecter over time. I am very pleased with the digital sound and picture. I could actually make out some of the scenes watching this DVD that were hard to see on previous releases.<br /><br />This is the first of the 8-Disc Batman Anthology: [[ASIN:B000B5XOYI Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology 1989-1997 (Batman / Batman Returns / Batman Forever / Batman & Robin) (Two-Disc Special Editions)]]. The collection features all four movies between 1989 and 1997 in 2-Disc packaging. A great addition to the DVD collection of a Batman fan. For a different approach to the Batman legacy, Warner Bros. recreated the Batman legacy in a newer film entitled Batman Begins with Christian Bale: [[ASIN:B000BUYP4Q Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].
B00008NRL8|4.0|I'm loving the CD. They have a great sound....sensuous and chill. I first heard their music on a compilation CD. They play some of their tracks on  Nip/Tuck too.
6305657947|3.0|This movie is OK, but I prefer the original version with Steve McQueen. This remake is too Hollywood for me, with too many unbelievable stunts. The original was better.
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|I have enjoyed the music and Celine's beautiful voice. I would recommend this CD to anyone, especially with small children. My son (who is 15 months old) loves it and fall's asleep to it almost every night. It's delightful!
8489367116|5.0|I have read all the great classics, from crime & punishment to war & peace to gone with the wind, and I was very skeptical when I read the reviews of Shantaram and how people we're calling it a masterpiece. after reading it, I can honestly say that I have never read anything that kept me reading as much as Shantaram did. Shantaram is a literary masterpiece and Roberts is Da Vinci with a pen. I don't believe I will ever read anything that will top this one, I don't think it is even possible. the only writer who might be able to do it is Roberts himself. there probably is not one person alive today that can read this book and say that it didnt make them want to be inside those pages, living the lives of these characters. I give this book 10 stars out of 5.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I was very hesitant to see this movie, I am a die hard Sarah Brightman fan as well as a Phantom fan. I was shocked to see Gerard Butler as the Phantom , but he did the character justice. Minnie Driver was very amusing as Carlota and she had to have had a ball playing her character. <br /> <br />I will say that I was happy to see the freak show clip, now I know that it did not come from the original story line but it does come from a very good book ( Phantom by Susan Kay) I have read that book at least 4 times and have passed it on to many friends. I highly recommend that if you are a serious fan of Phantom of the Opera to see this movie and to read the book.
B000AM4PBS|3.0|Everything about this set was amazing until I got to the Bonus Features...had audio, but no video. I had not realized that this was an Asian version that would not play on U.S. devices. The seller was very agreeable to refunding the returned product...thank you! I would deffinitely buy from this seller again.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I wouldn't say this season topped the first. I will say that it had me from the first episode again, and I finished all 6 discs in 2 weeks. I took breaks to TRY and spread it out, but it didn't work. I love this show with all the diffrent mysteries and how EVERYTHING and EVERYONE is connected. My group of friends all watch by themselves and then we get together and discuss what we watched. We are THAT into this show. I love how all the characters make the show. There is NO one main character, though I do believe that some people would beg to differ. I do not think so because without the backgrounds and personalities of everyone, the \\"island\\" would not be what it is. Watch this season to figure out what I am talking about!
B000J3HBZA|5.0|This was a very moving story...I really enjoyed sharing the journey with Albom. The copy I purchased was in excellent condition and even came protected in a clear book cover...much thanks to the seller!
067003830X|5.0|A revolution is now sweeping through the field of brain science, and this book chronicles the stories of the men and women who have ushered in a new age. The brain is no longer viewed as a machine that is hard-wired early in life, unable to adapt and destined to \\"wear out\\" with age. Instead, we learn that scientists are beginning to unlock the secrets of the powerful, lifelong, adaptability - or \\"plasticity\\" - of the brain. The implications are enormous for treating neurological disease, for addressing the aging process and for dramatic improvements in human performance. Author Norman Doidge is a psychiatrist on the Columbia faculty and he tells one spell-binding story after another, as he travels the globe interviewing the scientists and their subjects who are on the cutting edge of a new age. Each story is interwoven with the latest in brain science, told in a manner that is both simple and compelling. It may be hard to imagine that a book so rich in science can also be a page-turner, but this one is hard to set down.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|This is an awsome collection! My family and I love the packaging, the way the seasons are organized, and the very cool extras. We highly recommend this complete set to all Friends fans out there!
B000MZHW40|2.0|Blood Diamond is a message film.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers make the common mistake of assuming that their audience is too stupid to get the message. <br /> <br />The plot is a thin excuse to visit all of the unhappy sites around Sierra Leone and to revel in the atrocities being performed there.  Really, how many times do we have to see children committing murder before we get the point? <br /> <br />The dialog is very poor.  In fact, most of it will fit comfortably on a bumper sticker.  The worst offender is the often quoted phase \\"This is Africa\\" or TIA for short.  It must be important because they made it an acronym.  Right?  Wrong, it seems to invite the audience to ignore the central message of the film.  As if the filmmakers are saying, \\"Yes, audience, there really is no reason for the atrocities, it is just Africa. Ha, ha, fooled you!\\" <br /> <br />The ending of the film is predictable.  I am sorry to say that anyone who has not figured out the ending after watching the first hour of the film fully meets the expectations of the filmmakers. <br /> <br />I am not fond of message films.  I thought that given the quality cast and crew -- not to mention five Academy Award nominations -- that Blood Diamond might rise above the run-of-the-mill message films and actually be a good movie.  I was wrong. <br /> <br />Ironically, there is a good ninety-minute movie -- message and all -- buried deep inside Blood Diamond.  If only the filmmakers had cut about fifty minute's worth of redundant violence... <br /> <br />Dah, this is a message film (TMF)!  What am I thinking?
1582701709|3.0|Hey, good ideas are good ideas. I have read this book and the Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale and other than some spit and polish and a bit more spin The Secret is just a repackaging of that product. I don\\"t say one is better than the other, just that The Secret comes across as a bit more mystical. Plus I noticed in a recent story on CBS news the authors refused to be interviewed when they noticed the story was focusing on the similarities of their book ideas and that of Norman Vincent Peale's Original book. [[ASIN:0449911470 The Power of Positive Thinking]]
1572707208|5.0|Great self-improvement Audio Book.  Very logical, easy to follow and it doesn't make common-sense observations complicated with formulas and charts. Great way to present potentially life-changing ideas.  You're wasting your time in a car if you're not listening to these CD's.  Scotty/Sioux City
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Sonically the album was great, was amazing to hear songs of my youth sounding so different but still fresh with Beatles energy.  Even the new cuts were great given two of the band members have passed away.  This music will never get old and future generations are feeling the same as we did originally in the 60's.  My Son loves this music and shares the same joy I do when we listen together.
B000JBWWQ0|2.0|I was disappointed in the movie as it did not go into depth in regards to the insights, the book was absolutley fantastic due to this fact, but I feel the movie did not capture this which disappointment me. On the other side it was a move forward to awakening the people in regards to a more spiritual awakening.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I heard of \\"The Prestige\\" when it came out on DVD, but I didn't know too much about it.  Saw some commercials for it here and there, but I wasn't sure if it was something that I had to see right away.  It wasn't until I went to a store and saw that this was directed by none other than the brilliant Christopher Nolan (who directed my all-time favorite movie, \\"Memento\\").  That's all it took for me to buy the DVD without even really knowing what the movie was about.  I didn't care.  It had Nolan's name on it, and that's all I needed.  I watched it the next day and couldn't believe how great this movie was.  Not only that, but I ended up watching it again only a few hours after my first viewing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are so many twists and turns in this wild ride that I'll have to be brief in describing what it's about so I don't end up giving away something crucial (yeah, it's one of those where you give away one little thing, and it could possibly ruin the movie for the other person).  As simplistic as I can put it the film concerns two magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden.  The two were quite the team and worked together splendidly until one night one of their well known tricks goes wrong and ends up costing Angier a loved one.  He blames Borden for his loss and becomes obsessed with finding any means to out-show him, learn his secrets and destroy him.<br /><br />I know, this sounds like a typical \\"thriller,\\" but that's really only a small outline of the movie.  I had to keep it short and simple to avoid giving away too much.  \\"The Prestige\\" works more as a drama/thriller/mystery.  The entire theme of the movie is to \\"watch closely,\\" and there's reason for that.  You're not entirely sure what is going on until the very end, and even then you feel like you have to watch it again right away to verify what you've just witnessed.  Nolan's great at playing head-games with you, and it's nice to see him dive intos that area of film again.  Even though you're always trying to piece together what's going on, none of that takes away the enjoyment of watching these characters and how they interact in the environment around them.  The look and feel of the film is very dark, but it looks so gorgeous.<br /><br />The performances from Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine are perfect.  Bale never ceases to amaze me in the roles he takes, as he commits himself a hundred percent every time.  David Bowie even makes a small appearance in the film, and trust me when I say this, you do not see him as David Bowie on the screen.  You buy into his character completely.<br /><br />It must be said, even though this is a PG-13 movie, it gets pretty disturbing and the overall tone of the movie is dark and cold.  I wouldn't recommend it for children.  The DVD doesn't offer a whole lot of features, which is a shame because I have the suspicion that they will re-release it in a \\"fully-loaded\\" edition later on (which I will have to go and buy).<br /><br />\\"The Prestige\\" is a total success, and then some.  It's one of those movies that you have to watch more than once, and each time you see it (just like with \\"Memento\\"), chances are you're going to pick up on something that you didn't see the first time around.  If you're looking for something different and unique, I strongly suggest giving this a try.  It ranks up there as one of my top favorites of 2006.  Nice to see that Christopher Nolan has made another fantastic movie and has proven that he's not just a one-trick pony.  The movie may have a lot of twists and turns to keep you interested, but they never take away from the great story and characters.<br /><br />Are you watching closely?  -Michael Craneo piece together what's going on, none of that takes away the enjoyment of watching these characters and how they interact in the environment around them.

B000002N2P|1.0|Green Day landed much more success than they deserved with Dookie. So how did they follow it up? By releasing Insomniac, essentially the same record. That means you get the same invarying power trio format, songs played at the same speed, same volume, in the same key, with Billie Joe whining away as usual. It's almost offensive Green Day scored such massive success with this format. Not that I mind fast, hard music at all - I love The Clash and Sex Pistols, after all. But here's why Green Day cannot logically be considered the next Clash or Sex Pistols: The Clash kept things interesting by working in reggae, even in the early days (I'm sure White Man in Hammersmith Palais would blow these guys' heads off), while The Sex Pistols weren't around long enough for their sound to get old - anyway, they mixed it with some of the best protest lyrics ever. Green Day didn't vary their formula much until Nimrod, where they landed easily their best song ever (the acoustic Good Riddance), and a couple tunes I hope never to hear again (Hitchin' a Ride, King for a Day) in the process of experimenting; and you can forget intelligent protest lyrics. It's all the usual bratty complaining. And guess what? Some of these songs are awful: Geek Stink Breath, Walking Contradiction and Brat are the main offenders.<br /><br />Now, believe it or not, this isn't a total loss, unlike Dookie. Brain Stew was overplayed as hell at the time (and isn't really any better now), but at least it has a cool riff, and the speedy Stuart & the Ave. actually generates some interest. And I like the cover art. But Green Day sucked until Warning, which I acutally like, and continued sucking after Warning - in other words, if you're looking for Green Day, avoid everything but that album. At least that's my opinion. If you like this group, hey, whatever.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Babel is unlike any other movie you have seen. The scenes look like they came out of a news broadcast or documentary ... that is how real they are! The story is equally compelling and thought provoking. Don't miss this great movie.
B00004XQP4|3.0|In the parallel universe better known to some as my brain, Warning is the best Green Day album and the rest is terrible, to say the least. Okay, Nimrod had Good Riddance (The Time of Your Life), which is a great song. But it didn't have anything else going for it. American Idiot had Whatsername... and nothing else. Insomniac had Stuart & the Ave., Brain Stew... and nothing else. Dookie and Kerplunk had NOTHING going for them. Warning, meanwhile, has three of Green Day's greatest songs ever. And I'm not talking about Minority, which I think is horrendous: here's the kind of guy who would cry if you called him \\"different\\" singing \\"I wanna be a minority\\". That it became a hit is one of the greatest ironies imaginable. No, I'm talking about the title track, Waiting and Macy's Day Parade. All reveal a (gasp! Say it ain't so!) mature direction that this group should've taken loooooong ago. Plus there's assorted other good songs: Jackass has the only insightful lyric in Green Day history (Everybody likes a joke/but nobody likes a fool - so true!), and the funny stuff (Deadbeat Holiday, Fashion Victim) is actually FUNNY, rather than stupid.<br /><br />Now I'm not about to say Warning is perfect or anywhere near. I've all but written off Green Day's capability of making a masterpiece: they're too limited on their instruments, Billie Joe lacks an even remote way with words, and he can't sing either. And there are some crap songs here. I've already discussed my feelings towards Minority, so it won't do much good. I don't know what the hell Misery is supposed to be, but it's even worse than arguably Welcome to Paradise or even the dread Boulevard of Broken Dreams. There's also some of the usual angsty complaining (Blood, Sex and Booze), and a few brainless rockers (Church on Sunday, Castaway), and come on, do we really need ANOTHER song named Hold On? That's up there with Sail Away as the most overused song title of all time. Now, if the song was any good, that would be something different.<br /><br />If you must have one Green Day album, ya might as well make it this one. For once, all the songs DON'T sound the same (my main problem with the group) and Billie Joe writes some pretty effective poetry on the best osngs (Warning, Waiting, Macy's Day Parade). So even if Green Day STILL can't keep up with the heavyweights, and though I doubt anybody over 18 takes them seriously, this is a great alternative to most the rest of what they do.ifferent.  <br />If you must have one Green Day album, ya might as well make it this one.

B00005JPLU|1.0|I realise that the movie is based on a comic and not meant to be historically accurate, but come on... This movie is verging on the racist. IT could have been far more interesting had it tried to depict even a tiny bit of what Perisa was about. As for the action senes... a third rate copy of Lord of the Rings
B000NA28I4|1.0|I'll give the CGI team Four Stars for the Dragon Effects, especially the flight scenes through the river valley and the final aerial battle at the end, but the movie and story are the worst. Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are seminal stories which succeed as tales because they stand as archetypes; so both stories are nothing new (Star Wars and LOTR), just retold Jungian/Campbell tales done in a superb, fresh manner. Thus you might argue what's the difference if Eragon does the same thing? Star Wars and LOTR are STILL AROUND! With parallels in Eragon SO CLOSE to these two stories and films, I really can't believe there's no intellectual copyright infringement lawsuit pending...bottom line: the movie is boring: I literally pressed fastforward from 56 minutes to the end and the aerial battle.
0767802470|5.0|Das Boot - The Director's Cut is constantly rated by ex-submariners as the greatest submarine movie ever made.  I'll go one better:  in my opinion,  it is one of the very best best and most poignant movies about military life and action thus far produced.  Das Boot - The Director's Cut is gripping and absorbing.  In short, it is a classic!
0788812408|5.0|my kids love this movie.  the older disney movies are so much more tolerable.
B000JBWWBK|3.0|For me, I get my money's worth with Track 12: Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini in French is unbelievable.  The second this song played at the end of the movie, I knew I had to get my hands on this soundtrack. <br /> <br />It is a VERY eclectic mix of music, I like the Harry Nilsson numbers pretty much, and some of the French music is fun.  A couple of the final tracks (French songs) seem plodding to me, and the Patti Page number seems very out of place.  Maybe if I see the film again, I will gain a new appreciation?

1582701709|5.0|Readers don't over analyze the concept - try the concept for a few days - does it make you happy? I know it worked for me.  <br /> <br />The secret has imporved the quality of my life. It has made me a better mom by introducing positive thoughts to my children, a better worker by maintaining a positive attitude and a better wife by focusing on the positive qualities of my husband.  <br /> <br />The secret is really no secret, it is a great presentation of what we were taught since we were children. To have gratitude, to be thankful, to bless everything, to be positive...no wonder its appealing to masses. It is a reinforcement of our childhood beliefs.  <br /> <br />I would recommend it to everyone - happy thoughts make happy people.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000L212HC|5.0|This movie has quickly become one of my favorites due to what I feel is a very strong story and some convincing acting.  Throw in some nice special effects and the movie itself is great.  If you've seen the movie and like it as much as I do and have the equipment to really get the full HD effect (I recommend having 1080 resolution on your set and an HDMI cable) getting the Blu-ray is a must.  The audio and picture quality can really showcase your tv and player's abilities.  I have seen some very nicely made and tremendous looking DVDs look like garbage next to this.  However, if you are lukewarm about the movie or don't have the equipment to showcase it then save some money and get the DVD.
B000MTDRKE|3.0|I've listened to this cd 4 or 5 times, and I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer. I keep thinking it will grow on me, the way One and ? had to. But I'm not finding the catchy melodies or awesome instrumental sections that have been [...] in since The Light. I hope my mind changes, but I'm afraid it won't. Even my wife complained about the lack of melody, which is unheard of on a Neal Morse album.    Let's hope Neal takes a breather and comes back with another great one.
B0009UC810|5.0|Here is a movie that has a miasma of music, comedy, and car crashes. It is almost obscene how many times I have seen this film -- while the amount of times I have seen Star Wars is obscene. The Blues Brothers went way over budget with its vast destructiveness and cool cameos. Its exuberance is what helped this movie become a pop-cult classic and it would be John Belushi's last box-office hit. It is one of the first movies based on a Saturday Night Live and still, along with Wayne's World, one of the best.    The Blues Brothers are Elwood and Jake Blues, two brothers who just reunited after Jake's incarnation in Juliet. They visit an old orphanage of theirs that is in desperate need of money. The orphanage needs 5,000 dollars or it will be forced to close. Now Elwood and Jake can collect the money through dirty deeds, however they have an epiphany instead. During a James Brown sermon, a beam of light begets an idea -- the band. They need to hunt down their former band members and put the band back together. It has to work; they are on a mission from God.    This film has two spectacular and unbelievable car-chase scenes. They rank with Bullitt, The French Connection, and To Live and Die in L.A. as among the best filmed automotive-chase sequences. The first pursuit involves the Blues Brothers avoiding the 'rollers' by driving in a mall. The amount of destruction by the brothers, while spouting irreverent quips and the pursuant police is overwhelming, but fun to watch. They crash through stores, run over merchandise stands, avoid the mall-walkers, and create utter chaos. The second memorable chase involves the destruction of many cars. It is a long awesome sequence, that I will not spoil here, that was very costly and went over the expected budget for this film.    At the very heart of this comedy is the music. This film is essentially a blues musical. There are performances from James Brown, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, and many more. These entertainers also act in this film with varying degrees of success. Belushi and Ackroyd also perform several blues and country songs in this film. As amateurs, they are good. Belushi has a raspy singing voice, while Ackroyd has a baritone/bass quality to his voice. However, they still cannot compare to Charles proving the vitality of a piano or James Brown serving a sermon.    This is also a very funny film. Belushi had tremendous talents as a comedic actor and Aykroyd works very well here. One of the funniest scenes involves them trying to persuade their former horn player, who now works at a French restaurant, to come back to the band. Their antics amongst themselves horrify the bourgeois patrons as they guzzle food down, throw it at each other, and ask people if they are willing to sell their women. Also, look for a quick cameo in this scene by Paul Reubens (Pee Wee Herman).    Comedy is very subjective. However, it is hard to find too many people that do not like this film. It was even on a few critics top ten lists for 1980, i.e. Gene Siskel and Belushi's second box office hit (Animal House was his first). This film offers so much: music, comedy, and action. It is one of my favorite comedies and I have seen it at least twenty-five times. The 'R' rating is a bit misleading. It is there for the colorful and metaphorical language. If you have any inkling for blues and comedy then watch this film. If not, watch it anyway.

B000NA2776|4.0|I just got this cd today and love it. I got the single and was not sure how I would feel about the album, but must admit I am very happy I bought it. It reminds me of a modern day Freddie Mercury, and recommend any Queen fans out there to give it a try, you will not be disappointed.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|It's an excelent film about an extraordinary album Sting made. Ideal for those who remember those days or for those who want to get to know them. I saw one concert of the subsequent tour they made, it's among the best ones I ever attended. Enjoy!
B000AP04FG|5.0|This is a really fun movie.  Funny, too, but also FUN.  I had a great time watching this, and unlike many other drama / comedies, at every point where it could have easily become a tear-jerker, the writers broke it up with some comedy.  They pull it off well, and the entire movie comes together very smoothly.<br /><br />And in addition to a great story, the chemistry between Jolie and Pitt is absolutely evident ~ a perfect way to add fire to an already great story.<br /><br />If you like love stories but frequently find them too sappy, or if you like action flicks but frequently get bored by gratuitous violence, you'll probably like this movie, which strikes a nice balance between both.  I highly recommend it.
0767812166|5.0|By hook or by crook!  The region 4 DVD is in Widescreen and comes surprisingly fat with extras including \\"A making of\\" Featurette, theatrical trailers for Starman as well as Close Encounters and an audio commentary with Jon Carpenter and Jeff Bridges which is terrific!  Not only that, there's also a music video of Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen singing \\"All I have to do is dream\\" which is the song that Jenny Hayden and her husband, Scott, sing in the home movie she's watching at the beginning of the film. This is without a doubt Carpenter's best film, whether it's due to the writing or the actors or that he's just got a talent for doing romance or as he refers to the film \\"chick movies.\\" Listening to Bridges and Carpenter discuss the film, film techniques, Jeff and Karen's performances and acting in general was an absolute pleasure. Looking at this movie again, it's no wonder why Bridges was nominated for an oscar.  <br /> <br />PS: He gives away the secret technique he used to how he played Starman.
6305882592|5.0|This is a wildly funny and absolutely heartbreaking, but simultaneously uplifting love story about a short-lived and fantastically passionate romance between Harold, a depressed teenager, and Maude, a vibrant,  nearly-80-yr-old woman.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.  It is unusually timeless, side-splittingly funny, and able to constrict the hearts and throats of viewers with an incredibly realistic sense of mourning for the characters.
0393061434|4.0|This honest memoir of Apple innovator Steve Wozniak's life runs from a childhood spent discovering how things work to his breakthrough: building the first affordable computer with a keyboard and monitor. Written in an unconventional, first-person style, this autobiography is chatty, and sounds almost childlike. \\"Woz\\" tells stories of pranks he played, people who influenced him and the inventions he created. The first half of the book covers his life before Apple, and the second half tells of Apple's birth as a company, and his life during and after Apple. We recommend this personal visit with Woz to those with an interest in the history of technology and, in particular, the Apple-seed that gave birth to the Mac.
B000LE0TGA|5.0|For all of you reading the negative reviews now thinking \\"I shouldn't buy this because it doesn't sound good\\" forget that! From a technical side this album has always sounded great but now it sounds fantastic. Using state of the art technology Jeff Lynne personally oversaw and conducted the remastering. I too have compared the two CD releases and even the vinyl release and concluded this one just sounds best! But here's the thing, one can't fix something that's not broken. So when one thinks of a remaster one may expect a dramatic improvement in sound quality. Not so much on this remaster BUT! One will hear things that weren't as noticible before; actually make out the words on believe me now. Performances are more apparent so on and so forth. The only thing kinda lame about this expanded edition is that it gives the listener only three more tracks: two short ones and one brand new song; all of them are amazing. <br /> <br />Out Of the Blue is Electric Light Orchestra's most famous album, many consider it to be the best and that's difficult to argue with. The album was even more successful than another release prior to that and has some of the most famous ELO tunes on it, like Sweet Talkin' Woman and Turn To Stone and Mr. Blue Sky! This album released more singles than any other ELO album, and all of them shine. So If one is even a little interested in ELO, he/she should make sure that this decade defining album is in their possession!
B000KCHZK6|4.0|It is only now, after I heard \\"Not too late\\" a few times, that I can write this review. It wasn't easy, falling inlove with this one, but she got me in the end.  <br /> <br />\\"Come away with me\\" was a beautiful debut, presenting an upcoming, enormously gifted singer-songwriter, who was also humble (and a little bit shy) (which added to her charm). \\"Feels like home\\" suffered from the second album syndrome: It had its' gems, but it tried too much to duplicate the debut's success. This third album has a different aproach: Norah Jones takes on the role of a spokesperson of an entire generation of southern women living in the USA : a woman's love and loneliness in times of war in \\"Wish I could\\", \\"Thinking about you\\", and even a critical look on the election system on \\"My dear country\\". Even simple love songs like \\"Be my somebody\\" and \\"Little room\\" sound more grown up (one of them includes the line : \\"Last night was a record to be broken. It broke all over the kitchen floor\\" ). It feels great when someone is growing up with you. This beautiful little girl is now a woman. Listening to \\"Not too late\\" is growing up with her.
B00006I53S|4.0|I need to start of by saying that I am new to Digital SLR cameras and lenses, and am by no means an expert.  That said, I find this to be a very good lens for the price.  I was origionally considering a number of lenses, most of them L lenses, and finally selected this lens based on its decent zoom range, its image stabilization technology, and of course its price.  I use this lens now as my main lens on my Rebel XTi, as it does a decent job of getting close up (almost macro) shots, wider angle shots, and mid range telephoto shots.  The image stabilization technology works pretty much as advertized.  It definitely gets you a crisper picture with it turned on while hand holding, and it has saved me from using a flash in a number of situations.  My only real complaint would be chromatic aboration, which is somewhat noticable in high contrast situations.  Overall, I don't think you can go wrong with this lense for the price.  If you are looking for an all-in-one carry lense with good features and overall good image quality, this should be on your short list of lenses.
B00078XGRO|5.0|One editorial review is right:  the even numbers are better.<br /><br />There is a Next Generation episode which shares the name \\"First Contact\\", but the only common thread is the contact with a planet and those outside.  Actually, the emphasis is not as much on the first contact but the battle to allow it to be so.<br /><br />SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS!  I found elements of different movies in this story, especially hints to Star Treks III (destroying the Enterprise) and IV (going back in time and telling select earth people something about the future).  Sometimes, it takes away from the originality of the story, but this is an exception.<br /><br />Unlike Generations, this movie developed the teamwork that made this series and all other Star Treks.  However, the movie gets right into the action.<br /><br />I find the Borg the most disturbing of the Star Trek villains, and this fit the bill.  Alice Krige was excellent in her role.<br /><br />There are themes that were great in this movie.  For example, the friendship between Captain Picard and Data and sacrifice.  The issue of revenge and obsession.  The issue of submission to authority and the boldness to take risks when necessary.  The fact that people we look up to as heroes are just ordinary people like you and I who are motivated by the same things we are (or maybe not as high a motivation).  As a Christian, I can see spiritual warfare implications in the movie, as well as illustrations of pitfalls we believers can fall into.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I am always interested in something new or something old made different. Norah Jones has a way of mixing her music with two genres I also happen to enjoy: country and blues. This has been done before, but not I think with the slightly raspy, sensuous voice Norah displays. I also enjoy the instrumentation in her music, including of course her piano talent.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John has continued (no pun intended) his journey into the hearts of his fans.  I expected no less from him as I have watched him mature with his art of music.  He \\"continues\\" to strive to perfection!  What a perfect name for this album.  Loved it from the start!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I really enjoyed John Cameron Mitchell's \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" (2001) and was eager to see what he would follow that up with. \\"Shortbus\\" (2006) differs from \\"Hedwig\\" greatly in a number of ways.  Unlike \\"Hedwig,\\" \\"Shortbus\\" shows the perspective of numerous people instead of one major character, it is less campy and it isn't a musical. However, in some ways \\"Hedwig\\" and \\"Shortbus\\" are cut from the same cloth in that both are films about self-discovery, unrequited love and sexuality.<br /><br />The film tells the story of several unfulfilled people--Sofia (a couple's therapist) who can't reach orgasm with her husband Rob, James and Jamie, (a gay couple who's relationship has stagnated) their new lover Ceth, Celab, a voyeur of James and Jamie,  Sofia's new dominatrix friend Severin and the drag queen host of the club Shortbus, where the characters congregate.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the film we see the lives of these characters unfold and cross paths, as they look into their lives and ask why they are unhappy and what they can do to find fulfillment. Although there is a lot of graphic sex depicted in this film, it's not really pornography, as its purpose is not to sexually arouse the audience. I think film critic Roger Ebert best articulated the point of the film by noting that it is \\"not about sex, but about sexuality, not about scoring, but about living.\\"<br /><br />I really, really enjoyed this film. All of the characters were sympathetic and intriguing. And just when you thought that you had someone figured out, they would do or say something that you didn't quite expect, taking the viewer for a ride and throwing some curve-balls.  \\"Shortbus\\" may shock you a little, but more importantly it will make you think, as well as laugh and smile a little along the way.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|Does Amazon offer a close caption version of this with David Attenborough as narrator and NOT S. Weaver? I liked her in \\"Year of Living Dangerously\\" BUT NOT FOR THIS.
B00005NB8K|5.0|Great movie and performances from all.  Not sure why he didn't get a nomination.. must have to any collection
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|this will no doubt be a great set on blu-ray but shouldn't they wait until the 4th Indy Jones comes out?
B000F8O35U|5.0|Perfect DVD to add to the Disney collection.  A must have - Great family entertainment
B000EYK4KI|1.0|Overall a bad buy! Horrible DVD mastering with menus that never fully load and buttons that don't work. The movie has a couple of really funny extra clips in it, but nothing really \\"finished.\\" The extended scenes aren't scored, which is really distracting because I couldn't stop thinking about the great \\"Mondo Bongo\\" song that should have been there during the alternate ending, et al!  <br />Don't bother with this one... check out the Directors Cuts of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" (amazing!) and \\"King Arthur\\" - they're both very worthwhile.
0684867621|5.0|Legendary horror writer Stephen King takes readers on a trip into a parent's worst nightmare; finding out that their child has gone missing.<br /><br />Trisha McFarland, along with her mother and older brother Pete, have decided to spend the day hiking on the Maine-New Hampshire trail.  Quilla, Trisha's mother, is determined to show her children a good time.  Both kids have had a somewhat difficult time adjusting from their parents' recent divorce, especially Pete.  He loved his school in suburban Boston, but now he's the subject of jokes and ridicule at his new school.  Plus, it seems he and his mother are constantly arguing.  This arguing drives Trisha up a wall.<br /><br />The arguing has continued on what was supposed to be a fun and enjoyable day.  While walking on the trail, Trisha steps off for a minute to go pee, but also to remove herself from the bickering between her mother and brother.  However, after a few minutes, Trisha discovers that she has wandered too far from the path and can't find her way back.  She is lost.<br /><br />This miscalculation on Trisha's part begins a ten-day odyssey for Trisha that includes wandering completely out of Maine and into New Hampshire.  She suffers from numerous falls, scrapes, bruises, and wasp stings, as well as hunger and thirst.  But to make matters even worse, Trisha gets a sense that something is following her; something incredibly evil that keeps itself hidden from view and only touches the edges of Trisha's mind.<br /><br />Trisha's only contact to the outside world is her Walkman radio.  She tunes it into the Boston Red Sox baseball games in the hope of hearing about her favorite Red Sox Player: Tom Gordon.<br /><br />As the days and nights continue to pass in the woods, Trisha begins talking to Tom, hoping that somehow, he will give her strength and help her to get out of the woods.  She has lost twenty pounds, and has survived on stream water, nuts, berries, and edible frens she managed to scavenge.  Its already been several days since she left the path; will Trisha, with Tom's subliminal help, survive in the woods until she can find a way out, or will the creature catch up with her?<br /><br />This is a fascinating book.  Being a parent of three children, I can only imagine the horror of losing one, be it in a mall or in a forest.  Trisha's development of character is handled magnificently by King.  She goes from being a mostly happy and content nine-year-old to a terrified person who must call on every ounce of inner strength to survive.  The transformation is both exciting and scary to read.  Being a big baseball fan, I especially liked the parts about the Red Sox games and how Trisha called upon Tom Gordon to help her.<br /><br />I give this book my highest recommendation.  Instead of blood and guts, King scares the reader with a real-life scenario and lets the tension build by having the reader guess if Trisha will make it out of the woods, or if the unseen creature will catch her first.  If you're a fan of psychological suspense, then be sure to read this great book..

B0000214F0|3.0|All those qualities mentioned in my title describes this movie however, those are qualities consistent with caligula's reign and the decadence of Rome. This movie captured that. <br />From a cinematic perspective this movie is mediocre.. The plot was weak, the dialogue was rediculous at times, the wardrobe looked fake at the beginning (began to look more authentic towards the end) but, the overindulgent immorale atmosphere of this movie made it interesting and believable. <br />I do wish they would have shown the other characters instead of having the whole movie concentrate on caligula and thats the main weak point of this film. From an artistic angle this movie was good, the real sex scenes added nothing to the movie. The Graphic lesbian scene was a complete waste of time, thats probably something Bob Guccione decided to put in to fullfill his sex scene quota for this the film. <br />If you want to watch an excellently executed roman epic, get the HBO Rome DVD.. If you want to watch an expensive x rated broadway play, then this movie does the trick.
B0002858YS|5.0|After listening to this one for a long time and Sam's Town the Killers are easilly one of my favorite bands. My favorite songs on the album are as follows: <br /> <br />3. Somebody Told me <br />2. Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll <br />1. All These Things That I've Done <br /> <br />This album combines originality with music that is all around easy and pleasurable to listen to, something that is very hard to do. i bought a copy for my sister and even my mother likes the album.
B0000041DF|5.0|Blindingly fast - I can only imagine the hand cramps she had afterwards!  Simply amazing.
0060578793|5.0|There are two main reaons to get this book: <br /> <br />1. If you do any serious outdoor activity which places you far from civilization (hiking, cycling, kayaking, etc.) then from a saftey standpoint this is a must. It comprehensively covers navigation, first aid, how to find food and water, shelter building, and much more. Also, it covers other situations which might strand you in the middle of nowhere like if your car runs out of gas or you are in a plane crash. <br /> <br />2. The second reason is that if you like being out in the wilderness, it is a very pleasurable read. this book tells you how to do so much cool stuff that I still find myself reading over the interesting parts again (I now know how to make smoked rabbit jerky in the middle of the woods). <br /> <br />All in all a well written and informative book.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|I got this DVD as a gift for my Dad.  He had it on VHS, but wanted to update his collection.  He really loved it.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|I had a great time at this movie a few people out of the movie and throw up.I think that's the sign of a fun film.I enjoy how it related everything to the rest of the Saw movies. I think all the clues that were set up in this movie for \\"Saw 4\\" are sick.I could wait for the next movie.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I've played this new collection quite a few times in just the past 24 hours since its release...despite the fact that I already own all of these songs on Stevie's other CD's.  There is no one remotely like her, and as a writer, no one has come up with more artistic, poetic rock music that anyone and everyone can identify with.  However, as any Stevie Nicks fan will tell you, there's a LOT---and I mean A LOT---of great material missing.  I guess for that, you should buy her \\"Enchanted\\" boxed set.<br /><br />If I were you, DEFINITELY spring for the CD/DVD combo of \\"Crystal Visions\\".  The transferred videos, sound quality, and most of all, Stevie's delightful commentary makes it worth twice the price.  I was astounded that anyone could recall so many amusing details after all the time that's past.  Her recollections feel so personal, relaxed, and unscripted, it's like having this amazing gal sitting next to you.  Stevie is one person who's way overdue to write what could only be a fascinating autobiography.
B000J4QWNQ|5.0|I enjoy the film a lot.The HD DVD features are awesome. Michael Mann created a really good version of \\"Miami Vice\\". The combination of your HDTV and HD DVD player seeing how the movie was truly envisioned is cool.This movie should be in every persons HD DVD collection.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|I have nothing as profound to say as other reviewers. But this CD is even better than \\"9\\"...Rootless Tree is phenomenal and Accidental Babies may well be one one of the most honest and devastating songs ever written, let alone the best Damien Rice song ever... As a fan of Leonard Cohen, Nick Drake and Steve Earle, I recommend this with \\"0\\" reservations...
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Arcade Fire is one of those rare bands who have seemingly always been under the spotlight. Behind an amazing live show and a self-released EP, the group was signed to Merge Records, where a great deal of excitement built for their debut Funeral. After that release, the group went all over the world touring, then set out creating their follow-up, which has been followed and anticipated with an almost breathless amount of excitement in many circles since it was announced.<br /><br />  In many ways, Neon Bible sounds just like I imagined it would. It's more expansive, tackling larger subjects lyrically while throwing even more unique instrumentation into the mix. It makes use of some very peculiar, but effective production in places, calling to mind a definite 80s influence while largely refusing to play it safe. For the most part, it's the sophomore release without the stumble. Like their debut, the opening half of the release is nearly airtight, with song after song that absolutely lock into your head. Opener \\"Black Mirror\\" gets things going with a claustrophobic feel, with a driving rhythmic track touched with swirling vocal effects, dense string arrangements, and flourishes of horns that give it the feel of a fairy tale gone bad.<br /><br />  If the opener was a dive into the deep waters, \\"Keep The Car Running\\" shoots back upward and parts the clouds with bright, layered instrumentation and a gait that reminds one of \\"I'm On Fire\\" by Bruce Springsteen. In many ways, \\"Intervention\\" is one of the biggest sounding songs on the release, opening with powerful pipe organ and acoustic guitar before building gradually into a soaring, grandiose piece that's one of the most powerful things the group has ever laid to tape.<br /><br />  From there out, the album veers even more wildly, with the two part \\"Black Wave / Bad Vibrations\\" cramming two disparate sounds into one short track. Opening with a sort of dark wave Go-Go's sounding section led with vocals by R&eacute;gine Chassagne, it morphs into a dark and downcast rumbler that grinds things out through the finale. Their blending of styles is apparent on just about every song on the album, as a track like \\"The Well And The Lighthouse\\" sounds like it's going to be a fairly straightforward jangling indie-rock track until the string and brass blasted choruses hit and push it into new and graceful territory.<br /><br />  Because of the jumpy styles and constant changes, Neon Bible is an album that really truly works as an album. There are a couple weaker spots, like the samba-touched \\"Ocean of Noise\\" and the somewhat bland \\"Windowstill\\" (which is dinged further by some of the more obvious lyrics on the album), but the group powers past those moments with more than enough standout tracks. Even the morose closer \\"My Body Is A Cage\\" blooms with an unexpected blast of pipe organ and drums that along with the reworking of \\"No Cars Go\\" (from their first EP) ends Neon Bible very strongly. Unlike a lot of bands who stumble badly on their second album (especially when there's a lot of outside expectations), Arcade Fire have put together another solid effort that should mark them as one of the more adventurous indie rock bands creating music right now.<br /><br />(from almost cool music reviews)égine Chassagne, it morphs into a dark and downcast rumbler that grinds things out through the finale.

B000N3SS80|4.0|We must remember that we are living times where artists are either \\"singers\\" or \\"entertainers\\". J Lo is an entertainer. While she is not the greatest singer she is not the worst either. I feel the songs were carefully selected to accomodate with her voice. Yeah, her voice might not be strong but neither is Janet Jackson, Ciara, etc. But they can give a good concert and entertain. I can listen to this whole cd w/o her voice being a deterrent. And anyone that listened to the tracks would also realize that Marc Anthony who can sing, has his hands all over the album. So if you like MA, you gotta like the album and give it some credit. I LOVE YOU J LO... KEEP DOING YOUR THING, MAMI...
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is a great movie in every way. My adult son watched it with me and enjoyed it. I won't tell you how it ends, but there is a twist that we've grown to expect from Ed Norton.  Unfortunately, it came out about the same time as \\"The Prestige\\" so it didn't grab the attention of the public that it would have otherwise.<br /><br />It is an \\"adult\\" story, yet there is nothing offensive in this movie.  The scenery is outstanding and the acting superb. If you like love, suspense, and a good story line, buy this!
B000N3AXQU|5.0|Ok, one Rocky V is not nearly as bad as many make it out to be. <br />It might be far from perfect but it had it's heart in the right place and actually felt like a ROCKY film again after the MTV cartoon of Rocky IV. <br />This film is just fab. Hits wonderful notes. Great work by the cast (especially Burt Young and Stallone) and excellent, subtle writing and direction. Probably the closest to the first Rocky, even moreso than Rocky II. <br />Anyone who calls this \\"corny\\", \\"cheesy\\" just has no soul.  <br /> <br />Loved it, ready to watch it again.
B00000DGUG|4.0|If the follow-up to Alanis Morissette's phenominal Jagged Little Pill sounds complex and complicated at times, it's only because Morissette's own set of circumstances were of that fate with having millions of listeners waiting to see what artistic direction the singer was going to pursue next. After finding a greater sense of self-worth and renewed inspiration with her trip to India in 1997, Morissette returned to the music charts in late 1998 with a collection of songs influenced by eastern thoughts, worldbeats rhythms, and psychedelic guitar grooves. She also takes a stab at playing the flute on a couple of tracks, but even more appealing is how Morissette's own lyrics still flow with her confessional honesty and earnest nature. \\"Front Row,\\" \\"Baba,\\" \\"Thank U,\\" \\"Are You Still Mad?\\" \\"Sympathetic Character,\\"--all pure Alanis. While the tone of this recording feels and sounds too abstract during the middle(\\"The Couch,\\" \\"Can't Not,\\" \\"UR,\\" and \\"I Was Hoping\\")Morissette gives us her sensibility and relative worldview again with \\"One\\" and the songs that follow thereafter. \\"You reduce me to cosmic tears,\\" she says in \\"So Pure,\\" or when she sings, \\"We need to question mightly and find God,\\" in \\"Joining You.\\" The result is an album unlike Jagged Little Pill but still one consumed with feeling, rawness, purity, and unapologetic emotion. No wonder she's been called by some as a modern-day Carole King.
B000002UAI|5.0|Many have said that this has been their \\"least\\" favorite Beatles album when compared to the rest of their amazing catalogue, but by doing that, many tend to overcriticize the content on this particular album.  <br /> <br />Instead, the album should be judged in context to the period the Beatles were in during this time. It is a highly known fact (as evident by the album cover) that the Beatles were simply too tired from touring, appearances, starring in a movie, and the constant rush of having to produce albums every six months or so. <br /> <br />In fact, even though the previous album \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" featured all original songs, the Beatles were so tired that they resorted to doing cover songs again to relieve themselves the pressure of writing more songs than they have to. Despite the weariness, the Beatles still created very good music as they work well under pressure. <br /> <br />In short, these are the tracks that I think are worth listening to (no particular order)  <br /> <br />\\"No Reply\\" <br />\\"I'm A Loser\\" <br />\\"Baby's In Black\\" <br />\\"I'll Follow The Sun\\" <br />\\"Eight Days A Week\\"  <br />\\"Words Of Love\\"   <br />\\"Every Little Thing\\"   <br /> <br />Surely, all the rest of the tracks are also worth mentioning but if you want a good sample of what songs set the tone of the album, then take a closer look at these tracks. Just listening to these tracks, you begin to appreciate just how wonderfully talented the Beatles were as musicians despite showing their wear and tear.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|Babel is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It goes into my Top 5.  I loved how, in the introduction, the narrator states that when man was created, we all spoke the same language, but then \\"God\\" scattered us throughout the lands and we all spoke different languages (and had different cultures).  In this film, one is shown how we all are one species; how we all react the same way to crises and are affected the same way, no matter what language we speak or where in the world we are from.  We are all connected and the world is somehow a much smaller place than we think.  Beautifully written, filmed, characters portrayed by fine acting, beautiful message.  I've found myself thinking about this movie frequently after viewing it.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Is the \\"modest\\" British warship, the \\"Surprise\\", hunting a far more powerful French frigate? or is Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew the prey?<br /><br />Based on the novels (which I have not read), this movie version is a superbly made story for the screen. I feel like I'm one of those people who loved Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movies, but never read Tolkien's books! Apparently, fans of the M&C novels are emotionally divided over this film version, just like fans of TLOTR books are over the movies. But I have to join those who feel that Master and Commander (the movie) must be an excellent adaptation of books to film.<br /><br />The single feature, I have to admit, which made me buy this DVD, is the inclusion in the film score of Ralph Vaughan Williams's, \\"Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis\\", used twice in the film when the pathos of death is invoked. It brings me close to tears whenever I listen to the entire tone poem; and heard during emotionally wrenching moments in M&C, it did bring me to tears. So, \\"Gotta have it!\\"<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the \\"ship captain and his doctor friend\\" relationship: so familiar to Star Trek (the OS) fans. It seems like a perenial pairing of opposite personality types. And Russell Crowe's captain to Paul Bettany's doctor are the central character dynamic that powers this story. They both admire each other, have a gulf-wide difference in what motivates their careers (which is at odds: the captain feels the doctor's scientific interests are mere \\"hobbies\\"); and share a penchant for chamber music (which some members of the crew endure with muted agony). CGI was perfect. Action did not dominate this action/drama. Cinematography was simply superb: I wish that I had seen this one on the Big Screen, ::sniff::.
B000NA28IE|4.0|This movie like all book adaptations had its flaws but I still enjoyed it alot. Yeah they left out a lot of good and some important stuff but the acting was not bad for a new actor and the fx were pretty darn amazing. <br />The special edition has some deleted and extended scenes that should have gone in the movie but as out takes there still good.
B00003CXMG|3.0|The autobiographic feature has always intrinsic limitations. To conceptualize or even depict, the personal experiences around the lives and times of a decade like the roaring late sixties and the irreverent early seventies, in which literally nothing was forbidden, demands from you a true challenge, due there is enough documented filmic material around this issue.<br /><br />In this sense, the material is interesting but the film to my view falls respect its anecdotic feature, without exploring another important factors that permeated those times.<br /><br />At the end of the movie I remained unsatisfied because of the fact the enormous deficit between the generated expectations and the achieved objective.<br /><br />In musical terms: excess of legato.
B000OIXNRU|4.0|This is a classic work of immense popularity. It contributes to the collective vocabulary of mankind, a concept, \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\". But I found the work rough going, hard to get into , and very slow reading. The only part I enjoyed a bit was the last letter in which Jekyll confesses that he is also Hyde, and describes how in taking his potion he brought out his inner bad- side, the evil Hyde.<br /><br />There has been much written about the Freudian character of the tale, with the Hyde representing the Unconscious Self which can never be wholly contained , but occasionally bursts forth to do Evil.<br /><br />There is also the basic idea given here of each person containing within himself 'two selves' a Jekyll good- side, and a Hyde- bad side.<br /><br />No doubt one reason for the popularity of the tale is the mysterious, spooky, even threatening atmosphere which pervades the tale.<br /><br />Those who like to be 'spooked' in this way will greatly enjoy this tale. I did not.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|This cd/dvd combo is an absolute must for any Stevie Nicks fan.  Of course the music is cool but to get a dvd of Stevie is soooooooo wonderful.  In the history of music Stevie still stands out as one of the best singer/songwriters ever and her clothes are always so cool!!!

B0006GAXKK|5.0|The 1975 Main Course album resurrected the Bee Gees commercially, but also critically and also as great artists. They had been floundering abit after their last hit single in 1972 \\"Run to Me\\". They hooked up with the great producer, Arif Mardin on this album and they came forth with a new sound that was different from almost everying on the radio in 1975. Their first hit single was Jive Talkin\\" which is great, but for me the next two singles were even better. \\"Nights on Broadway\\" is one of the most moving singles ever(it spoke of someone who went to find his lost love who had gone to Broadway to find fame). It has a great beat, but it was the introduction of Barry's falsetto on this track that really brought it home. It peaked at #7 after \\"Jive Talkin\\" hit #1. The 3rd(and a great single is Fanny(be tender with my love). It is a lush ballad with soaring vocals by the boys. Another great track is  \\"Snowbird\\" and is soulful and blends in so well with other tracks. \\"Winds of Change\\" is also great and reveals something of the boy's social conscience. A great album in 1975 to be followed, of course, by several other great albums in the years following.  Paul Hanna

Well, it's a good story, family curse,  hound from hell, an old family mansion, deserted moor, and an escaped convict, and Sherlock Holmes and his faithful Watson, add a fireplace, and hot cup of tea or coco and you have your evenings entertainment.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Look, here's the way it is. Today there's so much jive and so little heart. The first thing I noticed was the lack of nonsense. This man was the real deal. He still is. I've played these songs for decades, and to see him play them was surreal. What a voice! The first week I had this I couldn't listen to anything else. To have these song back in my head was to time travel. I'll always be loyal to Neil Young. Hopefully he'll inspire some young musicians to follow in his gigantic footsteps.
B00001QEE5|5.0|The movie is better than the book, thank you Disney.  Timeless classic that it is, you don't have to be a child to love it.  This is Disney at Disneys best:  pirates cove, hangmans tree, indian encampment,  mermaid lagoon, and skull rock. I could live at mermaid lagoon.
0618001905|5.0|This is a fascinating book about King Leopold of Belgium and how he meticulously created a slave state right under the noses of the Western powers. While the 'terror' part of the book is horrifying and predictable the story of the all emcompassing greed that possessed the King's partners to create and operate his 'dream' for him is just as disturbing. The fact that the Belgian Congo was run like a slave state into the 20th century is mind boggling and serves to remind us of the amazing lengths evil men can go if their 'visions' are left unchecked. Even today brutal oppressive regimes are allowed to exist all around the world because corporate greed.
B000001EXR|5.0|I remember seeing this album in stores when it first came out...I had gotten into Kiss about 5 years prior and actually had the song \\"Detroit Rock City\\" stuck in my head all the time. I had not yet heard much from KISS aside from early albums which captivated me. I looked at this album and it was almost scary...the band looked so edgy and had this hint of evil..then I looked at the track list and put the album back on the shelf. I walked home with thoughts of the album but it faded from memory. <br /> <br />about a year or 2 later, my uncle gave me his copy of Revenge and after listening to it I asked myself. \\"Why are they doing stuff like Psycho Circus right now when there is stuff like THIS out there?!\\" <br /> <br />fast forward to about 2004 and my friend let me borrow his copy of Carnival of souls following a long discussion about KISS and their music. He said that if I liked Revenge, I would probably like COS. I took it home and after listening to it, I actually got angry with the band. I thought \\"How could they record something so dark and not promote it?\\" From the opening screaches of \\"Hate\\" to the twisted rhythms of \\"Childhood's End\\" to the Premonition of a song known as \\"I walk alone\\", This album was a masterpiece. I strongly feel that the direction the last 2 non-makeup albums were taking could have lead to a resurgence that could have been even bigger than the return of the makeup. <br /> <br />Anybody who liked Revenge will almost undoubtably like this album.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins rightly rejects S.J. Gould's idea that science and religion are doing different things.  No,both offer explanations of how/why we are here.  I worry a bit about the way RD frames the debate between science & other ways of thinking.  Religious beliefs (the theological ones) are irrational; one doesn't need to be scientific in any strict sense to see this. <br /> <br />On meaning: Dawkins gets it exactly right.  The universe does not owe us meaning, esp., transcendental meaning.  Making/creating discovering meaning is a good problem to work on.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This DVD is a must have for anyone with a Madonna collection.  The CD has the Erotica(You thrill me mix) that all the Madonna fans were talking about last summer.  It's just good stuff.
B000F7OPCC|5.0|Best Indiana Jones film! They did everything right in this movie. I only hope they can pull it off again once the forth one comes out.
0312335164|4.0|Very good book, you can't resist to read on. It has the atmosphere of movies like The Sum Of All Fears, with high level conspiracies and some action...
B000H0MKOC|2.0|In comparison to the book, this movie takes out some of the more quirky, sharp, and unique parts of the plot.  The portions of the plot that it keeps, and often adapts into some kind of Disney channel outloook, leave much to be desired.  The alternate ending is drab and unwittingly abrupt, contrary to the book.  Even  when not being compared to the book, there is an alarmingly miniscule amount of character development and the acting is poor.  They basically took the book and crammed it into an episode of \\"Friends\\".
B000N3ST8O|5.0|As soon as it arrived, I knew it was my best media purchase of the year. The CD includes new live versions of some old favorites - \\"Landslide\\" with the orchestra is particularly beautiful. Stevie also covers Led Zeppelin's \\"Rock and Roll,\\" something I don't think you'll find anywhere else.<br /><br />The DVD is equally amazing - it is so great to finally have all the videos in one place. There are some rare gems on here as well; who knew \\"Blue Denim\\" had a video. And the commentaries are just hilarious!<br /><br />Also on the DVD disc are clips from a home video shot during the making of [[ASIN:B000002IB9 Bella Donna]]. The quality is rough (it's a home video from 1980) but there are some adorable moments featuring not only Stevie, but Sharon and Lori, and even Jimmy Iovine<br /><br />What really made the package for me, though, was the personal touch put into it by Stevie. It's evident when you first open the package, by the artwork, the picture selections, and of course the liner notes. Intsead of including the lyrics for each song, there is a paragraph long description of how the song came about or what it means to her.<br /><br />I Would have liked to have seen an album of all new stuff (perhaps an all-live album?), but I'm still very happy with what I got.
B00005NKK8|4.0|i was so happy with this soundtrack - almost every song on here brings back memories of a great time. you can sing along with everything, and it has music for every mood.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|Peter Pan is an old classic and I knew my daugher,4years old, would love it. Ever since we read the book, she was talking about her \\"hero\\". The animation is typical Disney- good, now once again powerful and colorful. <br />There are a couple of scarry parts with Captain Hook, cannon balls and crocodiles which didn't upset my daughter, but some children might get frightened by them. Of course one shouldn't get too deep into psychological aspects of the story (Peter Pan the boy that didn't want to grow up) or analyze sexual stereotypes (Wendy is automatically the \\"mommy\\" that will read stories, but never defends herself or others against Hook and his crew). It is an old Disney production, and it should be viewed and enjoyed as such.
B00004RF98|5.0|It was a treat to see this great musical again! The songs are wonderful and get stuck in your head. The dancing is amazing and mesmerizing to watch. I'm so glad that such a cinematic display as enhanced on this dvd can now be available to myself and many other fans who never want to forget what a wonderful time it was when Kelly and other stars triumphed on the big screen.
B000F48CD8|5.0|This CD was better than I thought it would be.  Jack White is amazing as ever, but the band creates a sound that is both familiar and mesmerizing.  If you loved the White Stripes you will love this even better - totally different but same amazing vocals.
B000E41MS6|5.0|What a great DVD series!  A quality product. Thank You!
0684135051|5.0|I had this book years ago. It has a lot of information & hints to making knitting interesting.
1400079179|4.0|While other reviewers have focused on the gripping plot of Da Vinci Code, I had to say that Dan Brown proves a story could be such a make-believe when supported with in-depth research, actual historic references and real-life details. No matter how fictitious a story is, when those components are well blended into it, then it's a best seller. Like most of best-seller novels, the idea is to exploit possibilities that may happen in real life, and happen in an extreme measure.<br /><br />Dan Brown exploits the possibilities of how passages in the bible might be interpreted and creates fictitious details in-between historic references.<br /><br />Other authors took subjects on the revival of dinosaurs, giant meterors hitting the earth, virus that swept out the entire humanity or other dramatic cases, Dan Brown chose to exploit any possible, most stirring fiction could come out of the bible. He did it well, probably too well.

1878424505|5.0|The Four Agreements <br /> <br />The Four Agreements by Don Ruiz is an attempt at breaking the shackles humans place on themselves through their conditioning in the society. Don Ruiz presents a fluid discourse on the possibility of BREAKING FREE of the conditioning through the practice of 4 simple yet powerful agreements one can make with himself. The artistic presentation of the agreements sticks to a simple language that everybody can understand with ease. The agreements themselves are very simple, but Don Ruiz excels at exploring the meaning and the power behind them through simple examples that everybody can associate with. The agreements are: <br /> <br />Agreement #1: Be impeccable with your word.  <br />Words have started wars and led masses to perpetrate unimaginable crimes. Words also have healed the deepest of human sufferings. The first agreement therefore is to honor the power of words and to use words impeccably.  <br /> <br />Agreement #2: Do not take things personally. <br />Everybody lives in a dream of their own, in their own projection of people and the surroundings around them. Looking in that light, it is impossible for someone to `truly' understand another person. Hence it is best to not take things personally, and rather adopt the \\"What do you care what others think\\" attitude.  <br /> <br />Agreement #3: Do not make assumptions. <br />If not sure, always ask the questions to understand the position of the other person. Also do not assume that someone else should know how you feel without you expressing your feelings. Even in the closest relationships, it is best not to make assumptions.  <br /> <br />Agreement #4: Do the best you can. <br />If one does the best one can to follow the above three agreements, one will have no regrets about not living life to the full. Even if life does not unfold in the most fruitful way one desires, one at least will be satisfied that he/she did the best. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, especially theunabridged Audio of it. The clarity in the expression is outstanding and is guaranteed to excite many emotions in you as you go through the presentation.  <br /> <br />The prayers at the end of the book are also very powerful.  <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed and associated myself with this book. I can guarantee anyone that there is something in this material that will touch a deeper part of you, no matter what your beliefs are!!  <br /> <br />Cheers !!  <br />
B0009P42S2|3.0|The hand-drawn artwork combined with CGI is simply stunning in this movie, it's a treat to the eyes.<br /><br />The setting is 1800's England, in an alternative Steampunk past where machinery powered by steam has advanced civilization to a new age of reason - the promise of steam that if it would've maintained dominance in lieu of combustion, would've reinforced England's dominance.  That's what steampunk is all about, after all, the investment that England made in infrastructure built for steam locked them into a future path that turned out to be weak and ill conceived in hindsight. It's a wonderful fantasy and when done well, it can be a rich alternate history.  Tim Powers and Bruce Sterling create interesting Steampunk tales, and I can imagine if they'd written a story for Katsuhiro Otomo to direct, the combination would be magnificent.  That said, the story just didn't work for me.<br /><br />At first it was predictable, like stock parts off the fiction workshop shelf.  A boy gets a powerful item of technology and has to fight his own father for the rights to assert his own will, his own ingenuity, and strike out on his own.  There isn't enough background to allow the viewer to believe that this boy has the skills necessary to pull off his part in this story.  There also isn't enough plot to sustain the believability of the entire story.<br /><br />Bad guys are comical and wooden, good guys are stereotyped and predictable.  If the movie hadn't been so pretty, I'd have given it a lower rating.  Fortunately, with the volume off, it's a beautiful show.<br /><br /> - CV Rick
0060229357|5.0|Somehow I managed to be unaware of this book until I read it for the first time the other day. All I can ask is, how the heck did I live this long and never hear of a book this awesome?!! Harold is the coolest boy in literature this side of Max. (Aww, you don't really need to ask \\"Max who?\\" do ya?) Reading about Harold's travels with his wondrous purple crayon opened my mind right up and put me into a terrific state of consciousness. The mid-twentieth-century was a golden age of children's books that showed again and again a streak of idealistic expectation that remains unmatched in books published at any other time. I love stories like Harold and the Purple Crayon, and so will anyone with an imagination, be they in their single-digit years or well beyond!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Every few years, lightning will strike and bestow upon the world a true Soul Singer.  A singer that can reach right through the speaker and massage your heart, hold it in their hands, and in some cases squeeze it enough to make you feel their pain.  In my opinion, lightning struck over the years like this: <br /> <br />Luther Vandross > Sade > Eryka Badu > Floetry > Jill Scott > John Legend > Anthony Hamilton and now Corinne Bailey Rae ! <br /> <br />Sure I missed some people in between but, not every flash of lightning hits the spot. <br /> <br />This is a MUST HAVE CD for anyone who really loves Soul music. <br /> <br />Here the combination for the night.. This CD, a bottle of good wine, and somebody to sway with (optional). <br />
0553213105|2.0|This book was difficult for me to read. The main drawback is the English (the real English they use in England) or maybe it's my lack of sophistication. The story of five daughters, seems like something for a teenage girl. There always seemed to be gossip and people really concerned about how others saw them. Maybe that's what makes Liz the main character standout. This story did not have enough action or masculine characters for my taste, but I understand it's a classic. The wahines must love Mr. Darcy.
0060775858|5.0|The beautiful book is so simple, in both words and illustrations, that it is almost stark, but rather that making the book cold, the style simply strips away everything that is extraneous, leaving behind a warmth and tenderness that has now delighted several generations of children.<br /><br />There are many good children's books and a number of great ones.  This one, however, transcends into the realm of indispensible literature for the very young.  This is one of a handful of books that one must--absolutely must--not only read but own and cherish.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This film is a classic.  The seller is fast and friendly.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|It's obvious that Nicks put a lot of thought into this package: Deep Dish Remix of Dreams, combined with the original version of Silver Springs, and excellent live versions of Landslide, Rhiannon, Rock n Roll and Edge of Seventeen. Wow! All live tracks are excellent, but I have to say, the version of Landslide on this CD is the best I've ever heard before. The orchestra strings are beautiful and her voice is flawless.  <br /> <br />The DVD is excellent, too. She provides commentary for all the videos, and some of the videos have never been seen before. Plus, there is video of her recording Bella Donna, one of the best rock albums ever. <br /> <br />This album really is the best compilation album she has ever done. It's just excellent, and soo unusual just like Stevie.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|(Spoilers)  The bad:  Does it bother anyone else that every bad guy in this movie, from the bomb maker to the drug lord, knows kung fu?  I mean, I was told this Bond was more real and had no gadgets.  Instead, I get a movie where Bond stops mid chase to get on a bull dozer to continue his pursuit, and somehow it helps him catch up with the guy?  You know what the guy could of done? Moved to the left or right.  And for a movie with no gadgets, it sure was convienent that Bond happens to have an EKG machine in the glove compartment in his car in case random heart attacking posions are ingested.  I have other gripes, like a bunch of Europeans playing texas hold 'em, and the multiple expositions of Le Chifre's \\"Tell\\" but will let them be.  I know, a bunch who read this are going to get mad at quibble, attacking the past bonds for their stupidity.  But that's not the point.  If the movie and critics call this a more real rebirth of the franchise (Babs Broccili said this specifically), then they should follow through with it. This just seemed to be more of the same to me.  Worse yet, I don't like that a rebirth movie has twenty plus in jokes for fans of the past movies. Let it be it's own movie and restart the franchise, or make it a sequel.  Don't do both. <br /> <br />The Good:  Craig as a killer.  He has cold eyes and the action was incredible for the most part.  I like him working for the role as opposed to the usual costing other bonds have done...but this is his first movie.  Remember, he's not really Bond until the end of the movie, and even then I really wasn't convinced he was bond.  I guess we'll have to see in the next.  But I am interested.  I also very much enjoyed the last thrity minutes or so of the movie (But won't get into for those who should see it.  <br /> <br />Overall:  I think a majority of the problems I have were the films inability to choose if it was being a \\"real\\" movie, or a tribute to the past.  Probably due to the numerous rewrites, and script not being completed until after filming had begun.  I definitely think there is a ton of potential for the next one, and will be waiting.  I'd recomend seeing it to action fans, though I'm not sure how the majority of Bond fans will feel.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|How does it sound? Better than the LP, better than it has before and that's saying something! McCartney's bass is much warmer, thicker. Vocals and highs (Ringo's cymbal) hang in the air like sonic snowflakes. Very wide, 3-Dimensional image. Highs are now clear and sweet without being distorted. Interior details no longer muddy.  On a good quality stereo, this is a revelation. Congrats to George Martin, et al.<br />\\"Revolver\\", a pun by an intoxicated John Lennon because when you put it on the turntable, it revolves!<br /><br />Bob Dylan, the antiwar, civil-rights, Woody Guthrie-imitating darling of the folksingers, the Voice and Conscience of his Generation, after penning \\"Blowin in the Wind\\", shocked and stunned his followers with \\"Bringing it All Back Home\\". The album used electric instruments (!) and  Dylan turned from trying to change the world by preaching at it to a presenting a bemused psychedelic satire. \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Bringing..\\" are  the two most influential albums of the sixties, maybe of music history.<br />Early Beatles were wildly popular with younger listeners, but generally dismissed by music critics of the time as being a wildly successful, but totally Pop phenomenon. Dylan said they were \\"Bubblegum\\". Dylan's friend Al Aronowitz (sp?), said that the Beatles weren't that bad. Dylan and friend were introduced to the Beatles at a certain party in Manhattan AUG 64, with smoke and and a certain intoxicant, still legal at that time. Dylan and Lennon talked and found they had a lot in common. Dylan suggested Lennon should put more of his feelings into his songs. Following this party, the Beatles became MUCH more introspective, and a few months later finished \\"Rubber Soul\\" (hear \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", \\"Nowhere Man\\"  & \\"In My Life\\"). See DVD \\"No Direction Home\\" directed by Martin Scorsese for details. The critics, who had been dismissive, fell over each other praising \\"Rubber Soul\\".<br /><br />The Beatles music suddenly changed and changed the course of popular music and culture forever (for better of for worse). \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" were the watershed events of the sixties. If one carefully looks at the release dates of ALL music before and one can determine what a sea change this was. BEFORE was \\"Ballad of the Green Berets\\" and \\"Good Lovin'\\", Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, etc. AFTER came music explosion now associated with the sixties, The Doors,  Led Zeppelin, Cream, the better Rolling Stones albums, Jimi Hendrix.<br />Around the time of  \\"Revolver\\" , the ONLY other similarly trippy music available was Donovan's \\"Sunshine Superman\\", Jefferson Airplane \\"Takes Off\\", Country Joe and Fish' Rag Baby singles, Vanilla Fudge \\"Keep Me Hangin on\\", Electric Prunes' \\"I had Too Much to Dream Last Night\\", Mamas and Pappa's , Frank Zappa's & Byrd's first albums.<br /><br />\\"Revolver\\" had both lyrics and harmonies were much deeper and more elaborate than anything the Fab Four had done.  But \\"Revolver\\" was quite different, even than \\"Rubber Soul\\". Thinking man's music.<br /><br />Starting with the acid fuzz bass on George Harrison's \\"Taxman\\" (a commentary on the 95% income tax rate the Beatles faced) there was a lot more dissonance. Ending up with the buzzy, trippy, music-concrete, John Cage style \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" - this stunned listeners. It was NOT popular when it came out, in fact I remember DJ's of the day railing about how they Beatles had lost their minds. The album is chock-a-block with references to popular intoxicants of the day, from the body feelings of Taxman to the euphoria of \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" to spinning vortex of \\"Turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream\\".<br /><br />There's the acid visionary -\\"She said She said\\"- \\"Who put all those things in your hair???\\". The urgent post-trip resolution \\"Got to get You into my Life\\" which dealt with getting rid of one wife and acquiring another.<br /><br />Following the happy day trip of \\"Good Day Sunshine\\", on the original US release was the nextday hangover of \\"For No One\\"- \\"The Day breaks, your mind aches, ...\\", .\\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" was NOT on the US album, not for twenty years, and I feel it frankly breaks the mood on this version.

B0009Q0F5U|5.0|There have been lots of raving reviews of this album, as well as the equally   sensational season 2 soundtrack.  I just wanted to add my opinion on one track, \\"Destiny\\".  An earlier review describes an Arabic string instrument being used, but it is actually a biwa, a traditional Japanese instrument that has such a distinct sound that it's hard to imagine it being used for anything other than traditional gagaku music.  I don't know if anyone but McCreary has ever tried to use this instrument for something else, but it hardly matters.  The fact that McCreary managed to use it so effectively in a piece that is so different from gagaku music is a perfect testament to his unique genius.  I'm really looking forward to following McCreary's career.
0743289684|5.0|This is a compelling account of a Muslim woman who found--really, ingeniously and courageously struggled--her way out of the Middle East, eventually making her way into Western culture.  Hers have been real cloak-and dagger experiences.  She has been and continues to be driven by what she sees as an imperative for first exposing and ultimately eliminating 7th century ritualistic and cultural cruelties and injustices perpetrated on Muslim women--still today--even outside of the Middle East. She has been and continues to be a target of radical Islamists.  Some of her remembrances and descriptions of Islamic practices regarding girls and women are breathtakingly stark. Unabashedly, she refutes the concept of Islam being a religion of peace and love.  AND she's been there and ought to know!
B000003JDO|4.0|Given the popularity of smash hits like the hard rocking title track Aqualung it is easy to forget what a richly textured and at times, delicate album Aqualung (1971) is.  In fact, the soft acoustic textures and recorders on pieces like Mother Goose really make this album work for me, even though I like some of the heavier aspects of the band's music.  This 25th anniversary special edition of Aqualung is certainly a huge improvement over my (long gone) warped and scratched LP and the sound quality is pretty good (20 bit remastering using the \\"Prism Noise Shaping System\\").  Listening to it now (after such a long time) is quite a treat.<br /><br />The lineup on this album included Ian Anderson (flute; acoustic guitar; and lead voice); Martin Barre (electric guitar and descant recorder); Clive Bunker (drums and percussion); John Evan (piano, Hammond organ; mellotron); and Jeffrey Hammond (bass guitar, alto recorder; and voices).  All of the guys are fantastic players, although I was a little disappointed to see (former bassist) Glen Cornick leave the band - I really enjoyed his playing on Stand Up (1969) and Benefit (1970).  Speaking of people leaving the band, this would be Clive Bunker's last performance with Jethro Tull.  Martin Barre is a great guitarist and uses tones that range from heavily distorted tones to cleaner tones.  The use of acoustic instruments including flutes and recorders really adds a nice touch to the album and lends some of the pieces an early English music feel.<br /><br />The tracks on this album range across a wide dynamic range: from all out hard rocking tracks (Aqualung, Cross-Eyed Mary, My God, Hymn 43, Locomotive Breath etc.) to quieter, acoustic pieces (Cheap Day Return, Mother Goose, Wond'ring Aloud, Slipstream etc).  I think the combination works pretty well although I prefer the softer, acoustic pieces.  Conceptually, Ian tackled organized religion on Aqualung (Christianity); and condemned it for not living up to its teachings (or so I think).  As a total package of music and concept this makes for a generally decent album.<br /><br />As I mentioned, they used a very fancy approach to remastering this album.  The sound quality is good, but you really have to turn up the volume a bit before you can hear the individual instruments.  The extra tracks are pretty good and even include excerpts from an interview with Ian Anderson.  The liner notes include reprints of reviews written by various rock magazines, along with the lyrics to each song, and the original inner painting that was included on the LP.<br /><br />All in all, this is a decent album by Jethro Tull that finds them poised on the edge of prog rock, which the band would explore full force on the excellent Thick as a Brick album (1972) and bring to full fruition on A Passion Play (1973).I think).

B000LE1FAY|5.0|I put this in my car's CD player once I received it an it hasn't left yet.  Wonderful treatments of French pop tunes--I just can't help imagining some caricatured scene of an artiste with a cigarette and a beret.  Seriously, this is a fine collection of pop and her clubby disco-esque rendition of \\"La Vie en Rose\\" is really quite fun.  In fact, the whole CD is fun!  I've never been a huge Belinda Carlisle fan, but I may have to rethink this in light of this delightful release.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|WE LOVED THESE DVD'S OF THE SEASONS 6 AND 7. HAVE WATCH THEM SEVERAL TIMES.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I helped my 10 year old daughter buy this with her allowance money after she saw it on PBS. She loves to watch it and imitate their voices and songs. I'm glad she likes it because these women exemplify a beauty along many dimensions.   This is a great counterpoint to the images of decadence and sluttery otherwise foisted upon us via the predominant media sewers.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|Eat A Peach was arguably the Brothers last great album, however as a fan of the band it is also a reminder of what we lost on October 29, 1971. With only 3 songs completed at the time of Duane's unfortunate passing the band soldiered on and completed 3 new songs for the album as a quintet. The results were outstanding and with the addition of 3 live tracks that wouldn't fit on Live at Fillmore East, it filled out this double album nicely.  <br /> <br />The remastering of this package far exceeds any of the previous attempts, the sound is now very clear and it is a pure delight to listen to this improved sound.  <br /> <br />The real benefit of this package is the second disc of live material that was recorded on June 27, 1971 from the closing concert of the Fillmore East. A copy of this show was widely circulated amongst tape traders, however the quality of the sound included in this package far exceeds those of any of the circulated bootlegs. Any new live recordings that surface with Duane Allman's slide guitar are must haves for any fan of the Band or anyone who appreciates quality guitar playing.  <br /> <br />This package is highly recommeded for those looking to upgrade their copy of the original album. It would also be a great place to start if you are looking to experience the Band for the first time, as it gives you a nice mix of studio and live recordings. The Allman Brothers need to be experienced in a live setting.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|As a huge fan of Clutch I find it hard to give any of there albums a bad review. This album will live in my player for months. The best way, I find, to judge an album is by how many tracks you skip during your second or third time around. I can't count how many times I've listened to this album and each time a single track isn't skipped. It has such a great flow and feel that it would be a great injustice to do so. If you're a fan of riff driven music with wildly inventive lyrics and hooks than this is the album for you. A great mix of power rock, funk and blues, the album seems to evolve from track to track much like their earlier titles. Take the Pepsi challenge and give this CD a try.
0671015206|2.0|Analysis of people with a net worth over a million as a \\"secrets about the wealthy\\" is wholly inaccurate. A monkey that owns a small home in L.A. would have a net worth over a million - but it could teach nothing about acquiring wealth. Let me explain, the threshold of \\"millionaire\\" being some quintessenial level of a fabulous lifestyle was created long before the 1920's - when a million would be the equivalent of about $25 million in today's inflated dollars.    Now, someone 65 years old who has a net worth of today of only one million probably doesn't have the skills or abilities to create a net worth over $25 million. In spite of what the author thinks, driving an old clunker of a car cannot build savings into millions - no matter how many years and compounding come into play.    I gave the book an extra star because the \\"secrets\\" and advice in this book are excellent for a 10 year-old, or even a 30 year-old that is spending beyond their means.    But to consider the habits of people who simply stayed in a home that appreciated and happened to be in stocks during a rare 8 year uptrend is misleading, inaccurate, and a disservice to the readers. The true study that the authors are looking for would be to study investment groups like the \\"Tiger 21\\" for investors with over $10 million in liquid assets. Club 21 members do NOT follow the profile in this book (have very little in equities) and as a result have 10 times their net worth. There is a lot of information online regarding the strategies used by Tiger 21 and similar groups to build and add to their worth - and you won't learn them in this book.    When the authors can point to dozens of people with a net worth over $25 million by following the precepts in this book - then I'll recommend it. Until then Dan Pena is about the only source for financial material that I'd recommend.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Wow! Absolutely fantastic! Y ou will love this DVD. The setting is great as is the singing and backing. Hayley Westenra is superb but so are the other women. The whole show flows along beautifully and if you are a fan of Celtic music like me you will really love this! This is one of my favourite DVDs. I like this more than the Celtic Women-which I also have- because of the fabulous setting and great singing.The sound is available in Dolby Surround Sound 5.1.Buy this DVD you will not regret it!
6305754969|5.0|Yes, El Dorado has a similar plot as Rio Bravo, and it stars the \\"Duke\\" and is directed by the same director. <br />But, El Dorado has a much tighter and leaner script, and doesn't contain any dreaded \\"filler\\" like Rio Bravo, nor does it have the woefully miscast Ricky Nelson. (It's still a superior western though) <br />El Dorado co-stars the much more effective James Caan, and the incomparable Robert Mitchum in a spectacular performance. <br />A great story, a wonderful and superb cast, lots of great action and masterful direction make this a \\"must-see\\" western. (that \\"splinters in the hand\\" scene has to be seen to be believed ! ) <br />Highly recommended.
B000MM1F5A|5.0|The CD is incredible and the DVD evocative of the fado scene in Lisbon - beautiful cinematography.  And a great bargain too!  5 stars for sure.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|It's probably a truism by now that the one thing you can expect from each new Wilco release is the unexpected.  When you think you've got 'em pinned down, Tweedy and company zig where you're thinking they're gonna zag.  That is as true with \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" as anywhere.<br /><br />Tweedy gave us fans a little preview of where his head was at in his now-famous bit of concert dialogue at the Abbey Pub, in Chicago, on 1/25/2006, where he stated: \\"I'm really really sick and tired of all this intellectual hoity-toity poetry bull****...I think if we could possibly pull off making this record we're trying to make, this super-dirty-soul record...I think if we can't make this record then the terrorists have truly won.\\"  Of course when I heard this clip on the internet accompanied by \\"That's the Thanks I Get\\" (which curiously did not make it onto this record) I started expecting a sharp left turn into raw soul music, sort of a loud, brash Solomon Burke-style jam session.  In no way does this album sound like what I was picturing.  But in its own way this is a soul record, in the sense that it possesses the quality that you find in only the deepest of soul records:  honesty.<br /><br />Let me back up for a minute.  I received my advance copy today by sheer luck, more than a month before the record's official release date.  Although I usually don't listen to music at work (at this point those two spheres of my life are pretty separate), I gave the entire thing a spin in one sitting.  I was both intrigued and disappointed.  The friend who gave it to me warned me that it was \\"mellow,\\" which is a term I have seen floating around the internet to describe the album, and he was right!  Far from Solomon Burke, I was hearing Steely Dan circa \\"Pretzel Logic.\\"  Not that this is a bad thing - Pretzel is one of my favorite records of all time in fact - it's just not what I thought I was going to hear.  Only \\"Hate it Here\\" really grabbed me.  For the first time in a decade or more I actually found myself let down by a Wilco record.<br /><br />But sometimes it takes time for things to happen.  Like any relationship worthy of sticking with, you give things a chance.  The second half of the record got a second spin at the desk, and the first half in the car on the way home.  I even took the long route just to let it sink in.  By that point I was beginning to come around.  The moment it hit me though was several hours later, when I was washing the dishes after dinner.  I started with \\"Hate it Here\\" and played it to the end.  By the time the final track rolled around I knew I had found a keeper.<br /><br />The key to understanding this disc is in the lyrics to \\"What Light,\\" where Tweedy seems to be addressing the attention which his songwriting has garnered.  \\"Just sing what you feel,\\" he croons in his best husky Dylan-esque, \\"don't let anyone say it's wrong.\\"  Later in the song he makes reference to what is \\"yours\\" being \\"everyone's from now on,\\" a fact that is neither \\"right or wrong.\\"  It's this kind of honesty and soul that defines this record, and meshes beautifully with the new, more grounded sound.  Tweedy here and throughout the record seems to be doing what soul artists from days past (Otis Redding, for example, or Solomon Burke) have done: that is to sit down, look around, and try to make sense of life.  Throughout there is a feeling of recovery, of healing from past wounds and sorting out relationships gone awry.  Tweedy asks the hard questions on \\"Side With the Seeds\\" and shows a quiet sense of humor and resignation on \\"Hate it Here.\\"  If \\"A Ghost is Born\\" was the bad trip, filled with devils, migraines and ten-minute drone-sessions, this is the quiet morning after when you wake up and try to put your life back together.<br /><br />As for the record's sound, there are all kinds of comparisons you could make.  I already pointed out similarities with Steely Dan, but there is also a Josh Rouse-ish feel, and a kind of prog-rockish guitar thing in some songs courtesy of Nels Cline that is often unexpected and sometimes unbelievably spectacular.  Tweedy seems to be in full singer-songwriter mode, and suitably the acoustic guitar makes a frequent appearance.  If the record has one flaw, it seems to be the fear of making too much noise.  At times Tweedy and company seem to be afraid they just might wake the neighbors.<br /><br />However, this is a small price to pay for a record that contains so much wisdom, that feels so grounded and sane.  Tweedy has shed what he considers to be his \\"hoity-toity poetry\\" (which actually did lead, in all fairness, to several of the best records in the history of popular music) and has gone back to basics with this set of spare, minimalistic tunes.  If there is any controversy swirling around this one, it can only be that he has turned his back on the critics the way he supposedly turned his back on alt-country fans after \\"Being There.\\"  I do expect a possible critical backlash and I'm sure Tweedy will be laughing it up as he readies himself for a tour.  Hey crits, there's always Loose Fur to drool over!<br /><br />In summation of this long, rambly, largely stream-of-consciousness review, this is a record to be ENJOYED.  Listen but don't overanalyze.  It's that kind of a record.ften unexpected and sometimes unbelievably spectacular.

0140288503|5.0|This book captures the subject matter like no other book could.  The research that went into this story was well worth it.  The story covers a military conflict like no other that I have read.  The intensity, fear, courage and just sheer determination to survive when others are falling around you was just awesome.  This book covers the one feeling of war that no other book has dared to cover, the feeling of not leaving a comrade behind when things go so very wrong.  You will definitely not feel the same after reading this story.  You go in young, very much like the troops who were there, and you come out a person who is definitely more mature.  You will be robbing yourself of a literary masterpiece of military nonfiction if you do not pick this book up and read it.
032147404X|5.0|Written in a style which is quite different than most other digital photograph books. It was very easy to read and presented information in a very useful/practical style.  <br /> <br />It focuses well on how to use a digital camera and not the technology. Full of useful hints and ideas. I helps the beginner to get up to speed quickly without wasting helps of time on technical terms.  <br /> <br />The humor used is \\"interesting\\" and might take some getting used to. <br /> <br />
0375831002|5.0|I was touched by this book.  It  brough me back to history that continues to repeat itself.  I have always been so overwhelmed by the number of people killed by the Nazi's. It was comforting to think of death being so gentle and so overwhelmed. This is a good story and I am so glad that he was able to share the memories of his family in it.  It is important to remember all the innocent.  I wanted to know what happened to Max and how did she get to Canada?  I especially liked the way he tied the power of words to the power people have over each other.
B000N3SRRC|4.0|I have been a huge fan of Clutch since I heard Elephant Riders back around 1998-99.  Each album offers something new to the band's excellent jamming and intelligent lyrics.  I picked this baby up yesterday and listened to it all evening.  Clutch delivers the same quality rock reshaped into yet another inventive form.  I would give this album 5 stars, but since Blast Tyrant is my 5-star Clutch album and is, I believe, on a whole different level than most other rock, this album gets 4 stars.  Thanks for the tunes Fallon & co.!  I look forward to blasting these tunes while grilling steaks and chugging beers this summer!
B000003S09|3.0|In The Court Of the Crimson King is without a doubt a landmark album that changed the course of progressive music, but in my opinion it does not live up to the five stars everyone so eagerly seems to want to give it.  The only 5 star song in the album is perhaps track 5: The Court Of The Crimson King.  21st Century Schizoid Man and I Talk to the Wind are also decent songs but pale in comparison to Greg Lakes work in any of the Emerson Lake & Palmer albums.  The major drawback is having to endure Moonchild, the longest song on the album,  which is nothing more than a bunch of disjointed sounds with practically no musical relevance at all.  Unless you're into the historical significance of the album I wouldn't waste my money on it.  In it's place I recommend Emerson Lake & Palmer's Trilogy and Tarkus.
B00000I8UF|5.0|ok so im still new to jazz. relatively. <br />i called the local public radio station and asked the dj to play me a specific track. he didnt have it. i mentioned that there are some young guys i work with that i am trying to just get to listen. he said that this is the record he recommends to people that are just getting to know jazz and lo n behold i happen to have it.. i dusted it off on the old hard drive... man was he right.... i put a copy in my car and have been listening to it for days straight like my mind is trying to memorize every note... its not as dark as miles, which i really dig, but sometimes i just need to listen to something that just drags me out of the doldrums and this is it..... <br />
B00002E233|3.0|If you have read any of my reviews before you know that sometimes I can find cheesy movies of any kind fun to watch(Deep Star Six, The Being,and The Green Slime come to mind),so the fact that this silly shark thriller is one i like to watch shouldn't surprise anyone. It tries so hard to scare you and has some very well done action that it most of the time rises above some plot holes and lapses in logic. <br />        In the middle of nowhere(of course) a research lab at sea is looking to find a cure for Alzheimer's and they are using shark's brains to test and get the cure. Problem is (as it always is in these movies) the lead Scientist is doing the mad Doctor thing and messing with nature(but looking stunning doing so) and before you know it, you get a shark with Albert Einstein's brain and the Hulks rage. Can you say \\"chum and get it\\"(sorry had to use that pun). Throw in a storm and let the lab start to sink, and you have human tar-tar and lots of action. <br />            Like I said I don't know why, but if you are in the mood this one isn't going to tax the brain, but it is a great way to kill a rainy afternoon.
006085880X|3.0|This was my first Jodi Picoult novel. It was recommended to me by my stepmother, who absolutely loved it.  I was disappointed with the book inititally because the writing style is not as sophisticated as I had hoped it would be; but in spite of this, I got caught up in the plot and had trouble putting it down. I finished the book in about a day or so, but instead of feeling a sense of closure and fulfillment upon its completion, I felt vaguely annoyed.  I immediately began thinking about what was WRONG with the book: Emily's unconvincing motivation for suicide, Chris' ludicrous decision NOT to act on his girlfriend's behalf, the quick and easy ending.  Still, I did enjoy the experience of reading this, in spite of its flaws.  I don't know that I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys more literary fiction, but it is an easy read for a boring day.
B000C3H4M2|5.0|The Talking Heads' third album (the first with producer Brain Eno acting as a surrogate member)is an amazing auditory experience in the newly remixed 5.1 version.  I haven't done the 5.1 side yet, but the \\"regular\\" cd remixes and alternate versions are amazing to anyone willing to wade through the negative technical reviews here.  I've plugged these discs through both my car audio system and my pc.  I'm hoping it will continue this well.  Okay, with that said, this album was the one that helped me through high school.  The paranoia that surrounds Animal and Mind were very familiar to any kid who was \\"different\\" during that period of time.  While I never experimented with drugs, the build-up that accompanies that song is now familiar to me from any severe insulin reaction I've ever experienced.  The album flows through with an urgency.  I think the beauty of Mind is very underrated, especially after the line \\"Everything is very quiet\\" when the cacophony of the previous seconds calms down to a quiet dissonance no one else was doing at the time. <br /> <br />The \\"bonus\\" tracks are amazing.  Don't skip them, thinking they are just fluff.  \\"Cities\\" is indeed the long version with the verse about San Antonio which was lost in the original album/cd version (but was included in the Once in a Lifetime box-set).  It was thrilling to hear that verse reinstated in \\"Stop Making Sense\\".  It's even better in the studio version here.  \\"Life During Wartime\\" and \\"Mind\\" are versions that feature the guitar madness of Adrian Belew.  These versions are more dissonant and guitar oriented.  Again, not to be missed.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|Unfortunately, or fortunately, Clutch never hit the mainstream.  That's probably because they are so damn unique.  When browsing sights like allmusic, when you see the list of \\"similar artists\\", it's simply not true.  Sounds cliche, but they truly have a sound and a style all their own.  Can their influences be heard?  Sure, but they turn them on their ear.  How Tim Sult did not make David Fricke's \\"The New Guitar Gods\\" list is a mystery to me.  No one today plays with such an incredible combination of melody and thunder. <br />From Beale Street to Oblivion caps off a trilogy (Blast Tyrant & Robot Hive/Exodus) that is as good as any other in the history of music, in any genre.  And this is coming from a die-hard classic rock fanatic who also loves Motown, classic soul, classic r&b, and classic rap/hip-hop.  There no weak tracks here, no filler, just another set of amazing riffs with lyrics that'll keep you scratching your head, and going to Google or Wikipedia to find out what the hell they're talking about.  But the payoff comes when it all actually makes sense. <br />I don't care what you're into, you'll like this record.  Clutch plods on as the most under-rated, under-appreciated bands around ('cept maybe Wilco).
B000M341QE|5.0|Amazing Movie... But, the language is awful. The movie is great though... seriously go watch it if your not offended by swearing!
B000069HJN|4.0|Some bands have musical chops ... but absolutely nothing to say.  Some bands have great messages to convey ... but very little appeal in the way of idiomatic mastery.  Supertramp, with or without this or that prominent member, has always had a lot to say and total mastery of every musical trick needed to get the point across!  Extended sax solos, spoken word, moody guitarwork (from the master of moody guitarwork), keyboard tricks to soothe the beastliest of progressive rock beasts, and the ever-competent rhythm work that holds the whole thing together - check.  Meaningful things to say that only become more meaningful with time - check.  Dynamic tension - check. Short little pop gems - check.  Extended chunks of progressive mastery - check.  This album has it all ... and is tied with Crime of the Century as my favorite Supertramp disc.
6305882592|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites in the world. Maude and Harold are on opposite ends of the life continuum, which is really essential for the beauty of the movie. It illustrates artfully how children and the elderly are so much alike. <br /> The quirky, eccentric interest they both have in death can be distracting, but really, it's a brilliant way to make the sweetness of their relationship unexpected and sublime, which so few movies accomplish. <br /> Cat Stevens' soundtrack is perfect for it, and I love the way it winds through and expresses the innocence and poignance of the very young and very old.
0321344758|4.0|Excellent and thought provoking book that helped focus my ideas on web useability.  As Project Manager for web design projects, I needed a view from 20,000 feet - this got me there and then brought me down to earth.  Very helpful.

The beat of the metal presses of old Detroit, the musio running<br /><br />before the storm, the expectation of something bad about to break, all<br /><br />handled with an aplomb that would make our saints look radical.  This<br /><br />disc-\\"Never get out of these bluses Alive\\"  the title saya it more<br /><br />eloquent than it could have been said by anyone else, pure impact, it says<br /><br />to me, \\"yeah things are mighty askew, and we may not be able to do much<br /><br />about it, so let's put on \\"Never get out of these blues alive\\" and go<br /><br />about our daily lives, the old \\"move along, nothing to see\\"  I write to<br /><br />the beat of John Lee Hooker, and as an added bonus feature, the 7th. and<br /><br />last cut of the disc has two old Paul Butterfield Blues Band alums<br /><br />playing with the Hook, Elvin Bishop, and Mark Nafalin, there is John Kahn<br /><br />from Garcia & Saunders roving band of musician's playing base on cut #6.<br /><br />But thats what I always loved about JLH, his ability to gather musicians<br /><br />around him, and school them that needs it in the ways of them motor city<br /><br />blues.
B000002KMY|5.0|It is always difficult to follow up masterpieces. Black Sabbath's Heaven and Hell album with their new vocalist Ronnie James Dio at the helm shot them right back into stardom, garnering critical acclaim both musically and sales-wise. However, what everyone was curious about was whether Heaven and Hell was going to be a one-off achievement, and if not, how the band would top it without original drummer Bill Ward who had left due to health problems. He was replaced by Vinnie Appice, who put in an unbelievable performance, making Mob Rules the timeless masterpiece it is.<br /><br />In many ways, particularly its track-listing, Mob Rules tends to mirror its predecessor, and even though both \\"Turn Up the Night\\" and \\"Voodoo\\" are excellent cuts, they fall slightly short off the mark in comparison to the one-two punch start of Heaven and Hell. However, contrary to popular opinion, I happen to think this album actually surpasses the first Dio-era record, most notably because of its more in-your-face mix treatment (by the legendary Martin Birch) and rawer musical landscape. New drummer Vinnie Appice proves to be an excellent substitute, and his drum fills on this album are among heavy metal's best. The drumming on \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\" is stunning. Appice never lets go and  supplies a strong rhythmic backbone to Iommi's sledgehammer riffage, accentuated by a fuzzed-out keyboard arrangement courtesy of Geoff Nicholls (now listed as a full-time member in the credits). Dio's vocals are among his most diverse, going from innocent, almost whisper-like sections to rousing high registers. No other metal band had written such a dynamic song before 1981, and Iommi's run-out lead simply tears the roof. \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\" is the greatest Dio-era Sabbath song ever.<br /><br />On the whole, Geezer Butler serves to thicken Iommi's rhythm parts on the album, but the predominantly dissonant instrumental \\"E5150\\" sees weird collection of sounds built around his screeching bass guitar, smothered by sizzling keyboards and eventually darker-than-black guitar effects -- it is a frightening experience. Also, the remarkable interplay of \\"Slipping Away\\" has awesome bass lines coming through its addictive chorus, punctuated by yet another mindblowing drum performance. The title track, while great, fails to leave as strong a lasting effect as that of Heaven and Hell, but \\"Country Girl\\" is a fantastic mix of powerful vocals and hook-laden rhythms. The slowed-down middle of the the song with beautifully harmonised guitar tracks (excellent production job!) and backing vocals is sublime.

B000N6U0E2|3.0|The movie itself seemed extremely slow and all the pain and struggle somewhat self inflicted. The suffering went on and on and on and then just for the last couple of minutes a bit of \\"happyness\\". I expected it to be more uplifting and joyous. However, I truly appreciated the bonus material; especially being introduced to the real Chris Gardner. He does inspire and I appreciate his message to fathers to be with and care for his children.
0684800713|1.0|I read this book as a book report when I was in high school some 20+ years ago. I read it thinking that I would be able to read a great book that launched Hemingway's career.  How disappointed I was with the whole experience.  From what I remember, all the characters were drunk, they spend all their time drinking and doing absolutly nothing productive with their lives.  The language that Hemingway uses in the book was crude and \\"swear-like\\".  Young kids (and even adults) do not need to read such language.  There's no point for such language.  No role models at all in the book.  I see no point in a 14 year old needing to read such garbage.  I think people like this book because it is written by the famous, Ernest Hemingway and they feel that they NEED to say it's good because they want to fit in.  It's either that or they have no morals and don't care what comes out of people mouths.  These are the people that probably like to watch \\"Jerry Spinger\\".  Anyway, the book had no point and no plot.  This was a very hard book to do a book report on and I ended up with a \\"C\\" on my book report because of my options did not map to the teachers.  I later found out that my teacher didn't even read my book report and outsourced it to her teacher's aid. This made me mad.  Teachers should grade their own students book reports, not give the job to someone I don't know.  I could understand having a teacher outsourcing the grading of multiple choice/ true false tests.  Things that have a definate \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" answer to them but not essays.  Anyway, if you like garbage and wasting your time this book is for you.
B00005JPGO|5.0|Not being a very big Leonardo DiCaprio fan in the past, this year I've had a growing amount of respect for this young man as he proves his acting chops again and again. First it was within the excellent Scorsese film THE DEPARTED, and now he does another great job in BLOOD DIAMOND.<br /><br />For some reason, this film stands out above The Departed for me. Where the Departed had an ensemble cast, Blood Diamond can make no such claim (although there is a sprinkling of well-knowns). Many African actors lend their previously hidden talents to the film, giving it a bit more authenticity than The Departed. Most notably among them is the buffed Djimon Hounsou (AMISTAD), a quiet man living in a quiet village that is torn apart by rebel fighters trying for a piece of the region's diamond trade. Djimon plays the smart and tough Solomon as he races to find his family and his son. After being imprisoned via slave labor by the rebels, Solomon finds a huge, rare, pink diamond and quickly buries it. Having been seen with the diamond, the rebel leader tries to hunt him down.<br /><br />In the meantime, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio, THE DEPARTED), a young opportunist from South Africa, is completely immersed in the illegal diamond trade. He runs into Maddy (Jennifer Connelly, DARK WATER), an attractive journalist from The States who infuses Danny with a sense of morality. Uncomfortable around Maddy, yet still attracted to her physically and emotionally, Danny sets out to find if the rumor he's been hearing about the large, pink diamond are true. He meets up with Solomon and the two form a tenuous bond; Danny wants the diamond so that he can escape Africa and thus his past, while Solomon sees it as a way to possibly save his missing son who's been captured and brainwashed by the rebels.<br /><br />As Maddy's views of right and wrong spin Danny on his head, and Solomon's race to find his son sparks memories of his father, Danny's not only in for a physical battle, but one that'll force him to deal with his own immoral and prejudicial history.<br /><br />Part nonfiction, part fiction, Blood Diamond forces the viewer to realize that the rocks they wear on their fingers may have come at a very bloody cost. The movie spares nothing to get its message across; there are children being dismembered, children carrying guns and spraying bullets onto innocent villagers, torture, explosive governmental flaws, and it's all surrounded by one terrible little stone: the diamond.<br /><br />A very compelling film with DiCaprio dominating the screen (and rightfully so). His South African accent was spot-on and his internal battles of right and wrong are pulled off effortlessly.<br /><br />This one's a must.that'll force him to deal with his own immoral and prejudicial history. <br /> <br />Part nonfiction, part fiction, Blood Diamond forces the viewer to realize that the rocks they wear on their fingers may have come at a very bloody cost.

0618680004|5.0|Just how dangerous can religion be in 21st century Britain? Not many years ago you might have thought not very - in this country the \\"official\\" religion, the Church of England, is toothless and lame, knocked into submission and put in its place by an advanced, secular working class.<br /><br />Well, Richard Dawkins wouldn't have agreed with you then and certainly wouldn't now. He sees religion - all and any religion from the most extreme to the mildest, with no quarter given to the C of E - as fundamentally anti-science and therefore dangerous indeed. In The God Delusion he subjects religious thought to the powerful scrutiny of the scientific mind - where's the evidence, does it stand up to rigorous examination? - and goes on to lay out the implications and consequences of religious belief.<br /><br />This is a roller-coaster of a book, and a great read for anybody who is worried about the apparent growth in superstitious thinking in Britain and, indeed, anyone who enjoys the merciless yet passionate application of rational thought to superstitious hocus pocus. (Incidentally, he deals with Christianity in the US too, although we can't do much about that. Interestingly there have been some real successes there for brave people who are prepared to fight against Biblical teaching in schools. We are having less success here on this front.)<br /><br />No wonder Christian creationists and god-botherers of all kinds fall over each other to demonise (literally) Dawkins. He is a lucid, materialist, Darwinist thinker and also sharply witty. There are places where you will laugh out loud, although this is a deeply serious book.<br /><br />Dawkins points out that natural selection has not yet been bettered as a scientifically convincing account of our existence as human beings, of the awe-inspiring diversity of the natural world, and the magnificence of the universe as we know it at present. He of course allows that there is a great deal we do not know, but insists that all human knowledge about why and how we exist must stand the test of scientific examination.<br /><br />Religious anti-science campaigners often say that since any scientific theory can be rejected if the evidence accumulates against it, that showings that science is no more certain than religion as an explanation. Dawkins disproves this. If new evidence is found to prove him wrong, he will admit it, he says. This marks out the scientist from the religious, who can never be proved wrong because their ideas cannot be tested but rely on \\"faith\\". He demonstrates with utter conviction that Darwinism is incompatible with religious belief.<br /><br />He demolishes the Bible - \\"a chaotically cobbled together anthology of disjointed documents\\" - pointing out that Christians who claim not to take chapters like Genesis literally any more are simply cherry-picking the bits they like. Why accept any of it then?<br /><br />Those who cite \\"faith\\" as a justification for religious ideas might as well believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden. Who's to say this is any worse than believing that if you murmur private thoughts in your head a man in the sky will hear your thoughts and may act on them, or that if you blow yourself up along with lots of commuters on tube trains you will go to paradise to be waited on by virgins (presumably this doesn't work for women - a common fault with religions)?<br /><br />Dawkins reserves his greatest contempt for those who seek to indoctrinate children with religion, without allowing them to grow up to make up their own minds. This part of the book is particularly important in a time when government is handing over schools to religious organisations while giving them freedom to teach creationism alongside scientific ideas (or hatred of Jews in a west London Islamic school). He shows how the religious are afforded great privilege and a dangerous undeserved \\"sensitivity\\" - protection from being \\"offended\\" by cartoons about the Prophet, for example (\\"if you say we're a violent religion, we'll kill you!\\").<br /><br />Britain is a deeply secular society, launched on this path by Henry VIII's schism with the Pope, and progressing with an independent-thinking and materialist working class. It seems unbelievable that thought can go backwards. There is a growing divisive tendency to refer to people (including children) by religion, and for the religious to claim not just tolerance but respect for beliefs that do not stand up to any rational scrutiny. The anti-science lobby increasingly pressurises schools, universities and research institutions. The so-called \\"left\\" have fallen for this in a big way with the nonsense term \\"Islamophobia\\" being used in an attempt to dull critical thought.<br /><br />A worrying miasma of confused thinking, and one which makes Dawkins's The God Delusion feel like a blast of fresh air.violent religion, we'll kill you!\\").  <br />Britain is a deeply secular society, launched on this path by Henry VIII's schism with the Pope, and progressing with an independent-thinking and materialist working class.

B000LC55F2|4.0|It is amazing to me that director Christopher Nolan, fresh from directing stars Christian Bale and Michael Caine in the incredible movie \\"Batman Begins,\\" is able to turn the quest for a magic trick into a two-hour movie.  Even more amazing is that even in the slow spots this movie pulls you into the complexity of the relationship between two rival magicians.<br /><br />Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are magicians working together, until a terrible tragedy on stage drives the two men apart and into rivalry.  Angier is the better showman.  Borden is the better magician.  Each magician attempts to alternately outperform and sabotage the other.  Each magician routinely finds ways to steal the other's tricks.  Borden particularly becomes adept at humiliating Angier.  Borden's ultimate trick, the Transporting Man, is particularly clever and makes Borden a lasting success.<br /><br />Angier tries, unsuccessfully, to learn how Borden does the Transporting Man.  Angier then travels to meet electricity wizard Nikola Tesla (singer and actor David Bowie) in Colorado.  Angier believes that Tesla has the technology it takes to make the Transporting Man work, for real.  It is at this point that the science fiction nature of this movie appears.  As an aside, Tesla's lab did not burn as shown in the movie.  Debt collectors dismantled and sold Tesla's Colorado Springs lab to pay his debts.<br /><br />Angier's return to London is phenomenally successful, sparking the rivalry with Borden anew.  However, the rivalry has acquired a sinister element, one that will bode no good for either man.<br /><br />Hollywood rarely attempts movies of this type because they are so difficult to pull off successfully.  Neither Angier nor Borden is particularly sympathetic.  In fact, the movie only works because Angier and Borden are continually fighting with each other in some form.  Rather than taking the easy way out, director Nolan uses the steady, deliberate pace of this movie to establish the mood and style of the story.  There is some action in this movie, but that is not the point of the story; atmosphere and slowly revealed horror are.<br /><br />In an era where movies vie for attention with non-stop special effects and action, \\"The Prestige\\" makes effective use of lighting and sets to give this movie a moody Victorian feel.  The special effects that are used evoke Jules Verne or H.G. Wells.  The equipment we see in this movie was very similar to that built and demonstrated by Nikola Tesla.<br /><br />\\"The Prestige\\" is a nicely directed and produced movie that combines proven movie-making techniques with modern special effects.  The result is a unique movie that will appeal to viewers that appreciate story and characters over action and special effects.  The final science fiction twist provides a disturbing chill even to those who had a suspicion as to how the movie ends.<br /><br />The generally unlikable principal characters, the slow pace, the lack of action, should have spelled box office doom for this movie.

B000MXPE88|1.0|Having authored several books on the history of the CIA I find my friends in Hollywood sending me scripts about spies. One that was given by Wolfgang Peterson's office many years ago was an early version of The Good Shepherd. The original screenplay was far better then the movie that was produced. The movie as produced ended up with a storyline and screenplay that came off like a bad stew of CIA history and characters. In real life, James Angeleton, the real life person Damon's character is based on, went to England to train under Kim Philby. By killing off the British spy the moviemakers killed off the most interesting story line in the history of the CIA. You see Philby was a longtime Soviet agent in MI6. He betrayed Angleton in 1950's-60's Washington before defecting. After defecting Philby was giving the job of countering Angelton's protection of the CIA. The real story of Angleton and Kim Philby would make a far better film. Philby who defected after decades of being a traitor in MI6 was used by the Russians to target Angleton and a series of phony Russian defectors to convince our people the KGB had no role in killing President Kennedy. But I guess that story is not as interesting as making fun of the white anglo saxon establishment. If you want to watch something close to real and much more entertaining, buy The Spy Who Came in from The Cold or go see the amazing film about the Stasi, \\"The Lives of Others\\". For those of you who want to know what really happed about Angleton's era, read THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE CIA. DeNiro should have known better but he must be given credit for getting a movie about the CIA made at all. It really is the toughest sale in Hollywood.

1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini confirms his brilliance as an author made in his best selling novel THE KITE RUNNER. With the arrival of A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS he is firmly placed in the realm of important communicators in literature, a writer who can offer a complex history of Afghanistan and the wars that have plagued that country for decades by creating characters whose development and interweaving lives provide a profoundly moving story. It is an amazing achievement and for this reader it even surpasses the superb KITE RUNNER.<br /><br />Mariam is a 'harami' (bastard), a child fathered by Jalil whose wealth comes from owning the cinema in Kabul and who lives in splendor, while Mariam's servant mother Nana, now condemned to the poor sector of Kabul, lives in anger for her plight. Mariam adores Jalil, imagining that since he is her father she can escape her poverty to live with him. But when she gathers the courage to try her idea she meets scorn from Jalil's 'real family', is not allowed in and returns to her home to find her mother has committed suicide. She eventually is reluctantly married to the ugly older Rasheed who treats her well until Mariam is unable to complete a pregnancy. Mariam then lives in shame and is regularly beaten by Rasheed.<br /><br />Another character is introduced when Laila is born to another couple in Kabul, a dysfunctional mother and warm father whose political inclinations alter as the forces of power change in Afghanistan from tarnished wealthy land barons to Soviet intervention and war to overthrows to Taliban etc. As a young girl Laila's best friend is Tariq, a bright and happy lad who lost one leg in a land mine explosion. Through the years and changes in political climate their friendship turns to love and unknown to Tariq who is off to Pakistan, Laila becomes pregnant with Aziza. Laila's secret is covered by her family's death and her reluctant marriage to the ugly Rasheed, still married to Mariam. In this odd household time heals private wounds and the two women become fast friends, sharing the household duties and now two children but also sharing the continuous beatings by Rasheed. A climax comes when the two women's futures are altered and they are forced by circumstances to part ways.<br /><br />Hosseini's gift for visual painting with words is comparable to the best of writers: 'She could make out the minarets in the distance, like the dusty fingers of giants...', 'It's the friction of grain against grain', 'She watched the winds stir mutiny in the dust, whipping it into violent spirals whipped through the courtyard' and ultimately the 'poem' praising Kabul that offers the book its title - 'One could not count the moons that shimmers on her roofs/ Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.' Hosseini takes us behind those walls for forty some years of Afghanistan's bloody history and while he does not spare us any of the descriptions of the terror that continues to besiege that country, he does offer us a story that speaks so tenderly about the fragile beauty of love and devotion and lasting impression people make on people. It is a microcosm of mankind, told with the ever-present history of war in the clouds that would try to hide the thousand splendid suns. The book is immensely important, poignantly pertinent to today's Middle East situation, and one of the finer novels of recent years. Highly recommended.

B00099BPP6|5.0|The consensus of reviews here seems to be that this is a pretty good recording with a miscast Fischer-Dieskau and a too-edgy Scotto.  But despite that, it sounds very good to me.

B000N6U0DS|4.0|PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a film that despite all its flaws (repetition of chases, repeated encounters that mirror the last, emotional overload, excessive playing time of two hours, etc) reinforces some truly important human values: love between a father and son, pushing forward toward success despite all the roadblocks, kindness for the plight of the homeless, and strength of character in the face of hopelessness.  Knowing that the story (by Steve Conrad) is based on fact, that Chris Gardner really existed to survive these hardships, makes the film even more impactful. Director Gabriele Muccino knows how to aim for the heart and the film is bound to touch all who view it.<br /><br />Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is an African American very bright young man married to Linda (Thandie Newton) who has a difficult time working double shifts at a thankless job to support the family due to Chris' inability to sell Bone Density Evaluators that he used the family's life savings to invest in for a future that looks increasingly grim. Chris and Linda and their young son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) live next to the poverty line and finally Linda leaves, frustrated, angry and hurt.  Chris and his son strike out on their own: the relationship between father and son as enacted by the Smiths is as touching as any on film.  Bruised by the lack of success in selling his machines, Chris encounters a happy man who says his secret is working as a stockbroker with Dean Witter in downtown San Francisco.  Chris applies for employment, passes an entrance exam and is taken on with the firm - only to discover he is an unpaid intern who must pass a hefty exam and perform at top speed in order to succeed.<br /><br />With no income except from Chris' continued attempts to see his medical machines poverty embraces the father and son and they end up homeless and hungry.  The only things keeping Chris afloat are his love and concern for his son and his intense will to survive and succeed.  How this works out is known because of all the PR from the film and from the actual facts of the story.<br /><br />Will Smith and his son Jaden give warmly human performances, giving the camera as much with the silence of their faces as they deliver with lines.  Yes, there are many moments when the heartstrings are heavily plucked, but there is no problem defending that in a society too famished for stories of human dignity in the face of tragedy.  The large supporting cast is well directed and the production values are excellent.  PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is well worth the journey.  Grady Harp, March 07ucceed.

B000O178BY|5.0|I'm not one of those guys who says that the newest work from an artist is their best.  Did I like \\"With Teeth\\"?  Of course.  Was it better than \\"The Fragile\\"?  Not really.  Ignoring personal taste, I think it's fair to say that \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is the music-changing masterpiece of Nine Inch Nails.  It was a fusion of the electronica of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and the raw guitar of \\"Broken\\" and Reznor has done nothing like it since (unless you want to count the track \\"Burn\\" which came out shortly after \\"TDS\\").  \\"Year Zero\\" picks up sonically where \\"TDS\\" left off and politically where \\"With Teeth\\" left off.  All of which is to say that I think this may be the best thing he's ever done.  Again, this is my personal taste of preferring a lot of electronic noise (I always wanted a whole album of material like \\"The Becoming\\" and boy, did I get it!), but the bigger proof may come from the fact that Reznor has never recorded or written anything as quickly as he has \\"Year Zero.\\"  Anyone who understands a creative mind will understand that if it spews out of you and you don't mess with it, that's your subconscious working, which is where genius lives.  It's loud, it's angry, and the future's not bright.  I can't wait to hear what Part Two is like.

Do notice the diversity of music from country to sitar to ballaed. <br /> <br />Lennon's In My Life is very good.  Listen to the words.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I loved Norah's older work, but this one just seems to fall short.  I hate to see her do this, but she seems to have settled into a place musically that lacks something, that charm that was so rich in her older songs.  If I were you, I'd get this CD from a friend first to see if you like it  = (
B000MQC9H4|3.0|I enjoyed this flick. The pacing was a little slow for a romantic comedy, clocking in at over 2 hours. I felt the chemestry between Jack Black and Kate Winslet was kind of weak and not really believable (not knocking either of them as actors..I love them!). But that is not enough to skip this movie. Its a good date night movie. You wont be disappointed.

B000GG4ZSG|5.0|On this legendary album, Reed celebrates Andy Warhol and his 15-minutes of fame stars in a glamrock style, influenced by David Bowie. This new edition includes two extra tracks, acoustic versions of Hanging Round and Perfect Day. The informative insert includes illustrations and an essay on the history of Reed and the significance of this album.<br /><br />Transformer is a type of decadent cabaret comparable to Bowie's Alladin Sane, but it is less bleak and much more colourful and engaging. Reed proved himself to be a master of many styles, from the compelling rock of Walk On The Wild Side through the tender and tuneful pop of Satellite Of Love to the oneiric Perfect Day, a haunting poetic excursion.<br /><br />Other highlights include the edgy rocker Vicious with its hypnotic melody and sarcastic/ironic lyrics (an attitude that would soon infuse punk and new wave), the quirky New York Telephone Conversation, the energetic Hanging Round and the stately Goodnight Ladies. The songs are highly descriptive of a time, a place and a mindset, and the music is powerful in places and very elegant.<br /><br />The stylistic variety renders Transformer compelling throughout while not detracting from the cohesion, making it a great piece of musical theatre. Devoted followers would agree that it does not reveal the complete Reed, as he has been so prolific and his oeuvre encompasses a much larger spectrum. But as a document of the middle seventies, it remains superb, an essential album for all serious rock fans.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1562829939 Between Thought and Expression: Selected Lyrics of Lou Reed]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004T1HA The Bells]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000739R Legendary Hearts]]

B000GG4ZSQ|5.0|These songs are harrowing but beautiful and ultimately rewarding if you can survive its labyrinthine descent into heartbreak and despair. The most melodic songs include Caroline Says I and II, the wistful Oh, Jim, the harrowing The Kids, the bleak The Bed and the soulful Sad Song.<br /><br />Over these beautiful melodies Reed lays his vocals that are so genuine, so apt and so gripping that listening to them is like being privy to the private and excruciating details of a doomed relationship. Of course, these all fit the complete picture to create one of the most cohesive and searing concept albums in rock, from the jazzy intro of Berlin with its lounge piano through the spoken poem of Lady Day, right to the melancholy last refrains of Sad Song.<br /><br />The grand production and sympathetic arrangements add gravitas to the somber mood to create a dark masterpiece of epic proportions. Somewhat inaccessible to some fans, Berlin has nevertheless improved with time and remains one of Lou Reed's greatest albums.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002LQD Magic and Loss]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0711930023 Lou Reed: Growing Up in Public]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000HZTB The Blue Mask]]
0783227434|1.0|Apparently for some reason, everyone loves this movie. They say watch it with fun friends. I did. It was so bad. There is no plot, it goes from one thing to another with no explanation. Unless you don't know a good movie from a bad one, don't get this. The \\"comedy\\" in it is so repeatative. He fought the mini version for it seemed like 10 minutes and he fought the deadites in the well for another half hour. The phrase it's so bad it's good don't even apply. It passed that point on how bad it is. The action is horrible, and you shouldn't waste your money or your time on the \\"greatness\\" this movie supposedly has. Disgrace to movies and horrible spin off of an H.P. Lovecraft theme.
B000N6TX1S|3.0|don't get me wrong it is a good movie, just that the story has become old.  the writing is not original at all and is full of stereotypical social commentary.  there is nothing new here or no great revelation, just another protest movie loosely based on current events.
B0007D0AZU|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC album! I can't believe I haven't heard of her until now. <br />This is the second funkiest stuff I've ever heard, second only to the Godfather of Soul himself. Heavy, heavy stuff.
B000AP04L0|5.0|I love this movie. It was on Comedy Central a few times a week one summer and I watched it every time it was on. <br />Like Dilbert, it has something any office worker can relate to but will still be funny regardless of where you work
B000NA2776|4.0|When I saw the video for \\"Grace Kelly\\" back in January 2007 I sat up and paid attention. Who's this I said? He sounds like a cross between Elton John and Queen. In fact, he sounds a lot like Freddie Mercury. I have to get this. Alas, it was not yet availabe in the U.S., so I got it from the U.K. instead. It was not until today that I was allowed to post a review. After listening to it for 6+ weeks I have to say that it is easily one of the best debuts of 2007, and one of the strongest in recent memory.<br /><br />Mika is apparently Lebanese born and Paris/London raised. He apparently was trained at the Lysee school of music in France. This is evident by the abundance of talent throughout the songs. He is clever, he is original and he is thankfully DIVERSE. \\"Grace Kelly\\", \\"Lollipop\\", \\"Love Today\\", \\"Relax (Take It Easy)\\", \\"Any Other World\\", \\"Billy Brown\\", \\"Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)\\" and \\"Happy Ending\\" are all solid songs.<br /><br />After repeated listening I felt that not only does Mika remind me of 70's Elton John and Queen, but he also reminded me of the Bee Gees in terms of his abundant use of falsetto (which is more refreshing than it is grating). He also employs elements of The Beatles with the Eleanor Rigby-ish strings on \\"Any Other World\\".<br /><br />The bottom line is \\"Life In Cartoon Motion\\" is cheap and the music is very good. Mika definitely seems like someone to watch in the future. Also you have probably already been exposed to his music via the Verizon telphone commercials on t.v. and in movie multiplexes which featured the song \\"Love Today\\". Already he's released three singles from \\"Life In Cartoon Motion\\"--\\"Relax (Take It Easy)\\", \\"Love Today\\" and \\"Grace Kelly\\" in Europe. \\"Grace Kelly\\" was a number one hit over there already along with \\"Life In Cartoon Motion\\". Now, if Mika could only conquer America. Probably not--too much hip hop garbage. But you could change that. Check out \\"Life In Cartoon Motion\\".
B000CSUUOG|5.0|This collection of 14 sketches represents one of the most powerful song cycles of Reed's career. On New York he deals with the wider world rather than personal concerns for a change, and in the enchanting core of New York City, he found enough to comment upon, like crime on \\"Romeo Had Juliette,\\" the terrible impact of AIDS in \\"Halloween Parade,\\" the tragedy and psychology of child abuse in the poignant \\"Endless Cycle,\\" the plight of the homeless on \\"Xmas in February\\" and wrong priorities on the powerful rocker \\"Strawman,\\" where he actually sings with open throttle unlike most of the other tracks where he employs his talking-style delivery.<br /><br />Older themes are revisited too: \\"Dime Store Mystery\\" is a moving elegy to his former patron Andy Warhol. Not all the tracks are memorable though - \\"American Whale\\" and \\"Mr Waldheim\\" for example, are not up to the greatness of the rest of the album. In addition, due to the lack of any other but the basic rock instruments, the sound is not as varied as on some of his other classic albums. Neither is this Reed's most melodic work. However, the lyrics make up for that - in beautiful lines like \\"Caught between the twisted stars the plotted lines the faulty map that brought Columbus to New York\\", the poetry is full of sharp and lean images, driven by Rathke's guitar, Wasserman's bass and Maher's drums. This album is a beacon of literate, intelligent rock and amongst the top 5 of Reed's career.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0859651649 Lou Reed: Between the Lines]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002W5C Walk on the Wild Side: The Best of Lou Reed]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000H5TZUO New Sensations]]
B000N3ST8O|5.0|This CD/DVD is amazing! I bought mine last night (last one on the shelf...) after searching 4 stores. Obviously this is a very popular album! The DVD is very exciting and perfect for diehard Stevie fans. It has a great collection of music videos with commentary by Stevie. It also has some footage from the Bella Donna recording sessions which is really cool to see. The CD is also really nice and good for anyone who enjoys Stevie! A good collection of songs and some great variations of songs! I have to say that this version of \\"Landslide\\" with the Melbourne Symphony is probably by far the best version of the song I've ever heard! It's gorgeous! Awesome album...highly recommended!!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I am glad they decided to take things in a different direction with this Bond. Its not that the older movies are bad, its just that you cant keep doing the same routines without them getting played out, even if you put a different face on them.    This was a darker Bond for sure, but that was actually a very good thing. The film had a different sort of added intensity this way and if they continue to develop and evolve the character from here then in the long run this could be a great series of stories.    The reason I couldnt give it five stars - the moive felt like it lost track about two-thirds of the way in. Before that things ran smoothly, but then they shifted around when the car crashed and the rhythm felt thrown after that and never fully recovered. It made it feel like they were trying to merge two films rather than tell a single story. It wasnt seemless enough at all, at least to me.    The opening was excellent, one of the best in-your-face action openings I have seen.    The torture scene. Im not going to give anything away by going into details but I dont think any man could react that well to what happened no matter what kind of training he has. Im not saying he wouldnt be able to take the pain and keep secrets safe, just such a thing would be too debilitating to keep your thoughts that clear and your responses so witty. I think a trained agent would be able to not give in and talk, but then again I think anyone facing that would have trouble talking at all. I dont see someone gritting his teeth and grunting, would be more uncontroled vocal responses and probably vomiting. Let alone the damage done, wow. I didnt take anything off my rating for that though, its a movie and a Bond film at that.    This was a more serious Bond than we are used to, and not at all comical. I didnt think that was a bad thing. The comic routines felt forced at times in the past, even in the Moore days. The dialogue was still good, plenty of that cocky Bond attitude, even if from a darker mind. I was glad to see they pulled away from the cheesy names for the girls, instead they made it a joke he pulled on the main female lead. That worked very well, a nice nod to the past while avoiding too much cheese.    I look forward to the next in the series. I think Craig makes a good new version of Bond.
1416914285|3.0|While I won't go so far as to nitpick Clare's creative (sometimes too creative) use of adjectives, I do have some critiques of this book.  If you've read the fanfiction, you'll be well-prepared for this novel, and in fact you'll have fun recognizing some of your favorite characters back, thinly veiled.  This is actually Clare at her best, lots of improbable but fun dialogue, good pacing for once, no long dragged out subplots that make the reader forget what the main plot is, with bits that make the reader laugh aloud (at least me).  I read the story straight through, and I enjoyed it.  I even bought it after telling myself I wasn't going to.  It is the kind of book that you binge on, read in one go and enjoy.<br /><br />However, there were things that really bugged me.<br /><br />1. Self-referencing.  Two things that jerked me out of the narrative were the use of the word 'asshat' which is widely used now, but not so widely used that I think it's a coincidence it's in this book, and giving Luke a 'Still Not King' bumper sticker, also fairly common, but still in-jokey.  I suppose if the reader hasn't read anything else of Clare's, they wouldn't notice, but I don't look at that and feel superior for knowing the joke, I feel irritated with the author for waving at her friends instead of writing the story.<br /><br />2. It's a soap opera.  Admittedly, an enjoyable one, but the story is all drama and passion and twists, and not all that much character development, or even consistent characterization. I sincerely doubt a girl who refers to herself as 'shy' would slap a guy she barely knows who saved her life, and then make out with a near stranger.  Not really shy actions.  Jace, too, is uneven.  Isabelle's fanfic alter ego was one of the most fun parts of Cassie's fanfic, so I enjoyed her, and I think she has fairly good characterization, but I didn't feel like there was a lot of real character development.  Sure, they learned things, and supposedly changed, but Alec is the only one who appears to grow.<br /><br />3. It's derivative.  This story is like the happy offspring of Harry Potter, Uglies, Inksheart, Star Wars, with Lord of the Rings as a distant cousin and Buffy as the down the street neighbor.  It does combine some of the better elements--friends, a knowledge of occult mythology, sectarian groups and violence, fun villains who may or may not be related to you, etc--but that doesn't mean it's original.  You take lots of strikingly beautiful things and blend them together to come up with something generically pretty.<br /><br />Valentine reminded me of Capricorn the entire book, and he only made an appearance at the end.  For readers of Clare's fanfic series, you'll enjoy picking out how she changed some of her scenes and characters to fit this story, but it's also like \\"ooh! this is like the scene where Draco and Hermione get locked in the wardrobe! Only instead of Hermione it's Ginny--er Clary!\\"<br /><br />People who enjoy this genre will enjoy the book.  People who enjoy Clare's writing will enjoy this book.  I'm glad it got published.  But it's not exactly the kind of story that you imagine lasting through generations.ec is the only one who appears to grow. <br /> <br />3. It's derivative.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Think back of your best college professor on his best day presenting a topic that you had heard about yet didn't really didn't understand.  And at this friendly lecture's end you fully and soberly understand what's going on...and you're mad as hell that the greedy and non-caring dolts have screwed everyone including themeselves!  Mr. Gore's true best version of himself is presented to us. This is what he was designed to do: tell us like a \\"beloved uncle\\" to take action now.  This documentary won two oscars.  Grab the popcorn and hold on tight to your honey. Then take action, now, to help the planet. This reviewer's first action plan suggestion: buy another DVD of this and pass it on, telling the receiver to watch it with a friend (or more) and then to pass it along...get the word out now. Our survival depends on it.  Now do this at least two more times.
0375701427|5.0|American Pastoral was one of the memorable books for our club.  We actually began the discussion in the car on the way to our hostess' home, continued through wine and appetizers through dinner.  We had some very divergent opinions on \\"Swede\\" and his reaction to the book's events.  The book also prompted a good discussion on whether the individual can change, parenthood, the Vietnam war as compared to the war in Iraq, and the context of religion in our lives.
B00005JMYI|3.0|Mildly amusing and generally inoffensive; Will Ferrell pulls off being a likable boor, and his co-stars are adequate. But the setups are much funnier than the bits themselves; there were a lot of those \\"boy, this is gonna be funny.... ummm, well, kind of...\\" A lot like an SNL sketch; funny premise, disappointing execution. Some potentially great cameos suffer the same fate; there are several well-known faces given almost nothing amusing to say or do. One telling sign of its mediocrity: you walk away remembering no killer lines that bring to mind killer scenes. Okay, I'll give them one: during anchor Ron Burgundy's struggle for newsroom supremacy, his signature sign-off is sabotaged on his teleprompter, and what results is pretty funny. That's one. Maybe I'm just not Ferrell's demographic; to paraphrase the late great Dr. Frank-n-furter, \\"I didn't make it for you!\\"  C+

B000N6TX1I|1.0|What an unadulterated load of left wing propaganda. A two hour lesson of how bad it is to be against illegal immigration. Fittingly, it is directed by a Mexican. Every scene drips with how nobel it is to be liberal. This was like watching a left wing politcal rally. What a crock. I guess if our world is to survive we must do away with conservative values and open our borders unrestrictively. Scientiste and homeland security ruined the world and it is up to old hippies and left wing beliefs to save it.

There is much to enjoy here, including some laugh-out-loud moments and some enthusiastic skewering of action movie cliches.  In the end, however, it is a little too cute and self-conscious, though never boring.  Stick around for the credits. Robert Downey Jr. co-wrote and performs the final song.

All of the songs on this album presage the mysticism that will haunt and inspire all of Cohen's work.
0553801503|5.0|I've seen several negative reviews on this site and others about this installment in the series.  The biggest complaint is the lack of action in the book.  I have to say that if you been reading this series just for the action, then you will be a bit disappointed, as the action is spread out and sparse in Feast.  But, if you enjoy the richness of the world and the characters, and want to further immerse into the Martin's world, you will be fulfilled from page to page.  This novel I think is completely necessary, showing the desolation of a world so recently torn by war.  People are gathering up, new plots are starting, and you can feel that things are teetering on the brink of exploding into a new era in Westeros.  The complete development of the characters and their inner struggles keeps things interesting even when the realm is experiencing a relative lull of fragile peace.  Martin is an amazing storyteller, and a very in-tune humanist.  I've been completely spoiled by this series, and Feast is no exception.
B000AARKW6|5.0|A longtime fan of Al Pacino, I saw \\"Carlito's Way\\" when it first came out, in 1993. Even back then, it was apparent to me that I was watching something very special. Since then, I've literally seen the movie hundreds of times, and it remains one of my all-time favorite films.<br /><br />The plot summary has been covered many times here, so I'll just stick to my comments. I think \\"Carlito's Way\\" is Brian DePalma's finest hour as a filmmaker. I could never understand the lukewarm critical response it received, though, ironically, time has been very kind to it. A lot of critics dismissed it as a second-rate follow-up to \\"Scarface\\"--which, interestingly, was also panned upon its release--but it possesses a depth and resonance that \\"Scarface\\" (or any of DePalma's other films, for that matter) just can't match.<br /><br />Having grown up in Queens, New York, in the 1970s--and having run with a pretty tough crowd--I was stunned at how well DePalma captured the sights and sounds of the time. It was like being transported back 20 years. But, perhaps because the film was made two decades after it's supposed to take place, \\"Carlito's Way\\" hasn't aged at all. Like many great films, it has a timeless feel to it, because it avoids many of the filmmaking clich&eacute;s of the period in which it was made.<br /><br />DePalma was already working from a very good foundation--Edwin Torres' two books on Carlito Brigante, \\"Carlito's Way\\" and \\"After Hours,\\" are exceptionally well written--but he could've easily dropped the ball. Thankfully, he didn't. Though he and Pacino were both initially opposed to rehashing the success of \\"Scarface,\\" they eventually decided to work together again. The combination was pure magic. Like many great actors, Pacino sometimes needs to be challenged, and DePalma challenged him. And he responded with one of the best performances of his legendary career. He brings an elegiac air to the character of reformed drug kingpin Carlito Brigante, which brings out a level of depth and emotional weight that the character of Tony Montana just didn't have. In fact, Carlito makes Tony seem woefully cartoonish and two-dimensional by comparison. As the film progresses, the psychic weight of Carlito's worsening dilemma is channeled perfectly by Pacino's every move and word. Despite Carlito's sordid past, you sympathize with him and his increasingly futile attempt to escape that past. The rapidly shrinking box that is Carlito's way out is communicated stunningly, by Pacino's acting, the excellent dialogue and cinematography, and, crucially, the music, which builds to a crescendo during the subway chase scene--one of the best chase scenes ever committed to film, in my opinion.<br /><br />A movie is nothing without fine acting, and DePalma did a wonderful job of casting \\"Carlito's Way.\\" The cast is, to a person, first-rate: John Leguizamo as up-and-coming gangster Benny Blanco; Penelope Ann Miller as Carlito's love interest, Gail; Luis Guzman as the traitorous Pachanga; and the ringer, Sean Penn, as Carlito's sleazy, out-of-control lawyer, David Kleinfeld.  Penn has had a lot of great roles in his career, but his turn as Kleinfeld is definitely one of his most memorable: over-the-top, but never less than eminently believable . . . and chillingly frightening.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the years have been very kind to \\"Carlito's Way.\\" It has aged better than any of DePalma's other films, and still looks and sounds as vital today as it did upon its release. That's a tough trick to pull off, but it's a testament to DePalma's filmmaking prowess and the actors' collective skill that, never once, do you catch yourself thinking about the age of the film. It's, quite simply, timeless--and, in this viewer's opinion, one of the best gangster films ever made. Whether history will judge it as such is debatable, but I believe that time will continue to enhance its reputation. It's a stunning cinematic achievement that will gain more and more supporters as the years go buy. I have absolutely no doubt about that.orters as the years go buy. I have absolutely no doubt about that.    <br />

This movie takes forever for the main storyline to take off and never properly introduces you to anything in the film. This is a teen flick with hot guys taking their shirts off and going after the girls but nothing more. If you like teen sex movies, well this is for you. This movie is 110% not recommended.
B000002TLX|5.0|RICHARD MARX HAS TALENT PURE TALENT & THIS CD REMINDES ME OF ONE OF THE BEST LOVE SONGS OF ALL TIME
B000JLQSW4|4.0|Re-mastered release from 1977 with extra songs.  The album is loosely based on the Isaac Asimov science fiction book \\"I, Robot\\".  This album to an extent looks at questions and whether we may or may not be pre-programmed and act in a robotic fashion; also dangers of uncontrolled development of artificial intelligence.  The I Robot album was released the same week as the movie Star Wars was released - a very fortuitous time.  This remastered version celebrates the 30th anniversary of the original release.  The most interesting of the extra songs is The Naked Robot - 10 minute medley of early stage mixes of instrumental pieces on the album.  I thought the title song of the album, I Robot, should have been used in the movie I Robot, but Alan Parsons was never contacted about it.  To me the song I Robot has a feel of mystery and intrigue.  It is my favorite Alan Parsons Project song, and another song on the album, I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You, is my second favorite.

I listen to portions of it every day, it makes me feel so GOOD that things aren't as they seem in life and that it IS possible to change them. But becareful, it's so simple, you might miss it!<br /><br />I've just been introduced to The Secret 3 weeks ago, and I plan on making it a life time practice. There really is a universal energy out there that adores us all. YES.. that means YOU too!!<br /><br />Religion has proven to not work for the majority. I'm not knocking religion, but let's be honest, of the people who attend church, how many REALLY have something you want?<br /><br />The information in this CD makes it EXCITING to change, and you can demonstrate it just by being yourself overflowing with abundances and radiating and glowing from the inside out. THAT'S what attracts people to change for themselves, not preaching.<br /><br />This makes it EASY to change, and for me, it made me want something more than I've ever wanted in my life! You have the power within you to find your answers, to make a life that you want, insteadof living a life of default.

B0007Y08T2|5.0|Ever since I acquired a fetish for melodic death metal, I've looked into a lot of bands that are classified in the genre. Dark Tranquillity was one of them. The Gallery was the first CD I bought by them, and it certainly won't be my last. This album is filled with bone-crushing heaviness, melodic beauty, and mythical lyrics. Above all, it has an atmosphere that is unlike any other metal album I've heard.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't review this as soon as I listened to it for the first time, because otherwise, it would'nt have been so positive. Dark Tranquillity is a lot heavier than other melodeath bands I've heard. You could probably even argue they're borderline black metal, but with a melodic sensibility. But I let it grow on me, and after a while I recognized for the masterpiece that it is.<br /><br />The first track, Punish My Heaven, opens up with drums, and then really fast, schizophrenic guitars and bass interwind with each other, and Mikeal Stanne lets out a \\"RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!\\" that catches you completely off guard. It gives you a good feel for what the rest of the album will sound like. The following track, Silence And The Firmanent Withdrew, is a lot more melodic, but no less evil. Other great tracks are the title track, The Dividing Line, The One Brooding Warning, The Emptiness From Which I Fed, and ...Of Melancholy Burning. But the whole album is pure melodic death bliss. My favorite song is by far the title track: The lyrics, instruments, atmosphere.... everything in this song is top notch. The lyrics are a good representation of the album cover, and the artwork throughout the sleeve of the album. What makes it even cooler is the female vocals (done by Eva Marie Larsson) that wail during the acoustic guitar interlude. This is also used on ...Of Meloncholy Burning.<br /><br />The best part about The Gallery is that even in its most musically complex parts, it still feels very atmospheric and seems to just serve the music. Mikeal Stanne can hold a growl for a very, very long time. Just listen to his shrieks on Punish My Heaven and The Dividing Line. Even when he sing clean vocals, they're still pretty gritty and low. Frederik Johansson and Anders Jivarp make an awesome guitar duo; they also interwind solos on Punish My Heaven and The Emptiness From Which I Fed. Martin Henricksson's basslines are ACTUALLY audible! Not only that, but his basslines are very intricate and complex, not just the same-old-same-old that other metal bands use. And Niklas Sundin's drumming is very unique. I say this because even when using double bass kicks, his drums glide over you, if that makes sense.<br /><br />The only time the album gives you a breather is the instrumental Mine is The Grandeur...., which is soothing, folksy-sounding acoustic guitars, but that is interrupted as soon as .... Of Melancholy Burning kicks in. Mine Is The Granduer is basically the prelude to ... of Melancholy Burning (Mine Is The Grandeur of Melancholy Burning). It's also the only other track to use female vocals.<br /><br />Inside the album sleeve, there are fragments of art scattered on the sides. Some of the pictures include a raven, lava, forests, and others I don't know what the hell they are. But that doesn't matter because each picture is very cool and interesting.<br /><br />The reissue contains 5 covers: Bringer of Torture by Kreator, Sacred Reich by Sacred Reich, 22 Arcia Avenue by Iron Maiden, Lady In Black by King Diamond, and My Friend of Misery by Metallica. I haven't heard the originals to be perfectly honest, but I can tell you that DT do an excellent cover of each of these songs, and could fit in right with the rest of the album.<br /><br />Like I said before, The Gallery is my only DT record, but after being blown away by it, I plan to get my hands on every CD I can find by tis awesome band. Even if you only like metal a little bit, I STRONGLY recommend you buy The Gallery the first chance you get. The lyrics are intriguing, the musicianship is great, the vocals are intimidating yet strangely emotive, and the atmosphere is priceless.<br /><br />P.S. And don't you just love the cover art?t strangely emotive, and the atmosphere is priceless.    P.S. And don't you just love the cover art?
B000N6U0E2|3.0|I'm nearly 2 hours into the movie before I see/read about any of the \\"riches\\" in this rags to riches story.  2 minutes later the movie ends.   It would been a better (i.e more uplifting) if more was devoted to the \\"riches\\" portion of the movie;  I would've liked to see some examples of how Will Smith's character now being on significantly better financial footing improves his life and the life of his son and the relationship between Smith's character's ex-girlfirend/mother of his son.  (And this could've been done while still being true to the real life story the movie was based on.)  That said I liked how the son was portrayed as a real kid -- not perfect but not a brat, plus Smith's son's acting ability was better than I expected.  <br />
B0002W18MU|5.0|of all the inept scribblings that i've done on amazon, i find that it's hardest for me to write about the music that is most special to me. words won't do. they can't really capture the magic in the music. it's a different language. but let me start off with this: if you listen to this album, and don't like it; then i don't trust you. don't trust you in the way that i wouldn't trust somebody who dislikes dogs. this is stunning americana music. towards the end of his life johnny cash was our great interpreter of american song. that voice! all of life's experience seemed gathered there in his breathe. i will compare this album to another one, and it may sound whacky, but here it goes: this reminds me of coleman hawkins' last album \\"sirius.\\" i know. i know. the comparison seems off the wall. johnny cash and a jazz saxophone player? but here's the thing: both these albums were their last recordings, and both men were suffering from failing health. these were once powerful performers now weakened by age. you could hear it in mr hawkins' playing, and ditto in mr cash's voice. but, oh the spirit, and oh the experience. the way with nuance. on both of these albums we get performances filled with a love for craft, a love for music. on \\"american v: a hundred highways,\\" johnny cash gave me jewels to listen to for a lifetime, as he did throughout his association with rick rubin. and let's not neglect to praise mr rubin. has anybody ever made an acoustic guitar sound so pretty on a recording? the studio know-how, the genius of getting the very greatest out of a performer, and then making that performance into some wonderous piece of art, were all achieved gloriously by rick rubin here (as on all his cash recordings). i now fantasize about a studio match-up of mr rubin and billy joe shaver. but that's for another time. enough said. thanks johnny cash. thanks rick rubin.
0393320928|5.0|This was my first introduction to Richard Feynman, and it left an indelible impression. The book consists of a collection of essays, ranging from his upbringing, loss of his first wife, a few anecdotes, and even an in depth look at the Challenger disaster. Among other things, Feynman is a great writer, and makes each of these subjects a captivating read. He has a brilliant mind, and an intriguing vantage point for every subject. If you ever wondered what makes some men stand out from the rest, this is a perfect book to read.
1565114159|4.0|Classic business book. This audio-book version is very well narrated, but it's a very abridged version so don't expect all the details from the printed version. There's enough material for the listener to understand the concepts and it's REALLY nice to be able to listen while driving in the car, etc.
B00000J7J4|1.0|Man, talk about hitting rock bottom... What was he thinking, let's make a fast buck and sacrifice all artistic integrity? The album ranges from good to bad to just plain ugly, the good being Yaleo and El Farol - most reminiscent of classic Santana, the bad being Primavera and Love of My Life and the ugly being Put Your Lights On, Maria Maria, and just about everything else with rappers on it - I wonder what happened there, the band walked out on him? The poppy Smooth is soooo NOT Santana. The Calling is filler, so soporiphic that it will make you snore in the first 2 minutes, and there's like 8 of 'em. Does this stuff come from the same man who produced Abraxas, Caravanserai, Swing Of Delight, Santana III and Amigos? No way. I mean, all artists want to try new things from time to time, but it looks like here Mr. Santana forgot himself completely...
B000DZIGDU|3.0|If you're looking for another Saving Private Ryan, keep looking.  This movie was more designed to show the emotional anguish that comes from being away from your family for nearly a year, and all of the psychological effects that come from anticipating being shot at on a daily basis.  The battle scenes are few and far between, but you seem to get a snap shot of how sitting around waiting and waiting and training and waiting takes it's toll on you.  Many questions are left unanswered but it seems like a pretty realistic sample of a person's life who has been through a lot.  Hard to rate it higher than a 3 though due to the multiple slow parts.  Great sound track!

0393317552|5.0|Seven long years I waited to own this book.  Countless trips to Borders, Barnes & Nobles, or surfing Amazon never produced a purchase.  It always somehow lost out to another book, some of which was garbage. <br /> <br />Then, one warm September evening, I boldly marched into a Borders and made that fateful purchase.  I was elated.  After so many years I would at last read this book which had once upon a time been so highly recommended to me by a professor. <br /> <br />The next day I set forth from my house, eager to sit outside, enjoy the nice day, and read my newly acquired book.  I decided to go to City Hall and pay a bill.  While there, I ran into the Fire Chief, who invited me to see our new power generator in the Fire House.  I set the book upon a bench and accompanied him.  I never saw it again. <br /> <br />Seven years I waited to read that book.  In the blink of an eye it was gone.  At this point, I can only assume some universal conspiracy against my reading it. <br /> <br />Disappointing really.  Hopefully I'll come into possession of another copy someday!
B000N3ST9I|5.0|To anyone in the music industry looking to see how a true metal album is supposed to be made, stop right here.  This is what metal should sound like.  I have listened to Machine Head since the day of the Burn My Eyes release.  Throughout the years the band has changed going to an almost Nu Metal stance...  This is not Nu Metal... this is the kind of album that will leave you with goosebumps from start to finish - and a different sound from anything Machine Head has produced before. <br /> <br />For starters, the songs are longer than normal... much longer, the album opens with a start very reminicent of Metallica's Master of Puppets.  Very slow and melodic, the beat quickly switches to about 9 minutes of some of the most brutal, driving guitar riffs on the planet. It was once said that the day of the guitar solo is gone... Aparently Machine Head did not get the memo, they appear in all the songs frequently and appropriately.  From start to finish there is not a single song that a listener will skip.  In fact I don't have a favorite song, the whole album is my favorite song.  Vocal-wise Rob continues to lay it on thick and mix it up with singing that matches the tempo of every song.  As far as albums go, The Blackening is destined to be an instant classic and probably the signature album for Machine Head.  Pick this one up, you will not be dissapointed.
B000N3STBQ|5.0|The following review has been 21 years in coming as Depeche Mode's 1986 album and crowning achievement of their discography, 'Black Celebration', has steadfastly remained my most favorite and revered artist album of all time.     Following the moderate success of the highly innovative and experimental 'Construction Time Again' in 1983 and then a more resounding achievement, both in terms of the critical acclaim and subsequent tour which followed 1984's 'Some Great Reward', the time had come once again (\\"Get out the crane...\\") for the Basildon four to push the creative envelope further still and reach deeper yet, in efforts to broaden their burgeoning, worldwide fan base. In essence, it was time the world took notice of Depeche Mode and the band was ready ready to be taken seriously as a major and credible all electronic act. Who could have ever imagined an album which featured nothing in the vein of 'radio friendly' singles and lyrics which reflected on the darker nature of \\"The world we live and life in general\\", would aid in ascending the band to such stellar heights?    'Black Celebration', a dark, moody, sonic epitome of what the band was all about in terms of sound, word, voice and overall aesthetic, saw the creation of what I lovingly refer to as Depeche Mode's own personal, exclusively electronic sister to 'Dark Side of the Moon.' Indeed, the prodcution values and themes present on this 5th studio album were richer, more densely layered and contained combined elements which would demand the band be regarded as a musical force to be reckoned with by fans and critics alike and also as harbingers of a new era in electronic music.     From the moody, darkly atmospheric, sample laden opening of the albums title track, to the industrial yet plaintive longings of 'Stripped', 'Black Celebration' is a seductive soundscape drenched in reverb, angst and an oppressive, foreboding ambience which conjures heady, if not bleak imagery of life, love and lust. The inclusion ofa slightly (final) remixed version of 'Fly on the Windscreen' (1985's 'It's Called a Heart' B-side) was an obvious and proper choice, given the fact the track seemed to lend itself perfectly to the overall vibe of 'doom and gloom' ever present throughout the album. Another slightly new and inventive production technique, previously employed on 'Construction Time Again' (though to a lesser extent) was the mixing and sequeing of tracks together without traditional pauses or breaks. This production value is most notably featured on the albums first three tracks, beginning with 'Black Celebration' and concluding with the heartbreaking yet gorgeous strains of 'A Question of Lust.' The mixing of the first three tracks as one extended album intro, remains to this day the most flawless album opening I've ever experienced and has yet to be duplicated. The albums ebb and flow, as well as its overall track arrangement and order, is nothing short of brilliant. Alan Wilder's meticulous attention to every detail is quite obvious in every sound, note and nuance.  Many of the production elements found on 'Black Celebration' bear a striking resemblance to the sounds Wilder would later experiment with on his Recoil project, while Martin Gore's profound, emotionally resonant lyrics are, I feel, some of the best of his career. 'Sometimes', 'Here is the House' and 'World Full of Nothing' are three of the most beautiful Depeche Mode tracks ever produced.     While I enjoy the track 'But Not Tonight' ('Stripped' B-side and included on the US album release), I do feel the decision to excise it from the re-master re-release was a fitting one as the track lends itself to a more 'pop' sensibility and somewhat diminishes the mood and atmosphere created by the albums preceding tracks. Some argue the song allows the album to conclude on a more positive, upbeat note. However, I feel the albums original (UK release) closing track, 'New Dress', achieves the same task but with more pronounced minorchords and haunting lyrics, while still maintaining an air of optimism against gritty realism - 'You may change the world...\\"    As for the DVD re-master, the sound is fresh, crisp and startlingly bold and the CD version is nearly as impressive. The albums packaging, replete with the embossed logos of the original LP sleeve and which features red tulips before a looming skyscraper draped in European military styled banners (the explanation of the album covers creation and design is especially interesting on the DVD documentary) is both stark, beautiful and visually appealing as ever. And while I regard Anton Corbijn as an accomplished photographer and graphic designer in his own right, I do feel the band's album and single artwork which followed 'Music for the Masses', suffered an artistic defeat of sorts after the band parted ways with photographer Brian Griffin ('A Broken Frame') and Towne and Country Planning.    After the release and critical success of 'Black Celebration', Depeche Mode continued (and continues) from strength to strength, purifying and always evolving their production prowess to the next level with each subsequent album that followed - a sign of true talent for any band wishing to succeed in the music industry. The sonic artwork crafted on this album has yet to be replicated and I doubt it ever will. 'Black Celebration' was the turning point for the band. It was a moment in time, a testament to 'life in the so-called space age' and an indicator that one of electronicas inimitable pioneers were about to take the world by storm. \\"I'll drink to that...\\"

B000N4SHPS|5.0|It was good.  Im already for a Rocky VII.  There are so many things Stallone can put together to make a script for another Rocky.  It could be just like Rocky II (another rematch).  I could come up with a script that could work, but I don't have time.  Long live Rocky.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|When Rocky Balboa, the sixth installment in the series, was announced, there was almost a unanimous cry of \\"ugh\\" from people. Like the Terminator getting a horrible third outing or Alien which had a really lackluster fourth one, the idea that another Rocky was coming out was almost like saying another franchise was getting another unceremonious finale. Imagine people's surprise when it actually didn't suck and it was - gasp - pretty good. It's not an awesome movie though but when you think about what it is and what it could've been, it's quite an achievement. <br /> <br />Rocky Balboa is having a hard time dealing with the highs of his youth and constant reminders of his current lows. Make matters worse, he has a rather shaky relationship with his son Robert and his wife Adrian has passed away. He's incredibly nostalgic for the old days and he has to realize the old days are over and he's seen as part of it. In the boxing world, current heavyweight champion Mason Dixon is underappreciated and booed since he keeps beating anyone he comes across and there's no heart in his fights. When a \\"what if\\" computer simulated fight appears on TV, it gets people curious and Rocky and Dixon seem up for it. <br /> <br />But Rocky's old age and a \\"has-been\\" aura brought on by critics tries to deter him and while billed as an exhibition match for charity, it becomes an even bigger match for Rocky and for Dixon who wants to be appreciated by actually proving he's a good fighter since so many of his fights were rather easy. With the help of his son, Adrian's brother Paulie and Marie, now all grown up, Rocky steps into the ring and proves he can still pull off the impossible. <br /> <br />If there's anything that's bad about the film is that there's a little bit too self-conscious tone to the film where it knows it's an underdog story and meant to be inspirational but it kinds of pushes it. Nearly every line of dialogue Rocky says is some beat-all-obstacles tagline that they'd put on movie posters (the one they probably didn't use for the movie ends up being the cover tagline I bet). And the whole thing just feels like a big downer after all since there's so much hardship Rocky has to deal with, you're almost surprised there wasn't a scene of him jumping off a bridge. Obviously this is meant to reinforce the more inspirational aspect of the film but it feels like the film's a walking Chinese cookie dispenser. <br /> <br />Sylvestor Stallone I always saw as being lumped into that \\"action hero\\" stigma of guys who look tough and can say one liners but they can't act. In this, he's actually pretty good (though not Oscar-worthy) and if it wasn't for the aforementioned lines he says, it'd be a quite poignant performance. Milo Ventimiglia does an admirable job as his son Robert and Geraldine Hughes is also quite good as Marie who isn't really portrayed as a kind of \\"Adrian Part 2\\" but instead just a female friend Rocky can count on for support.  <br /> <br />The film as a whole is kind of erratic for the most part. The pacing during its initial two-thirds is sketchy with many scenes of Rocky reminiscing and trying not to let things get to him (such as a humorous scene where a young punk girl goes after him cause he didn't buy them beer). It takes a good hour before the fight is actually officially announced and then we go into the training montage, complete with the infamous music and the museum step run although amusingly, it has a dog in it. But the big star is the fight which is a big knockdown drag-out fight between Rocky and Dixon and, shot in HBO-like format rather than the \\"in the ring\\" approach Raging Bull had, it's still quite a rousing scene. <br /> <br />I got a huge truth to spill: I never saw the original. I've seen snippets of scenes and I have seen IV but let's face it: I was 10 and I forgot most of it. So I can't really comment if this is the best Rocky since the original or a pale comparison. What it is though is a pretty good film andnot the embarassment people thought it'd be, including me. Now, let's see if the Rambo sequel is the same thing.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Here we have a very fine example of popular music in the mid-1980s in a very highly regarded concert film that was directed by Jonathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs and much else).  The Talking Heads were quite popular and very admired within a certain fan base, but only broke out into pop stardom with a few numbers such as \\"Burning Down the House\\", whose lyrics even David Byrne notes are a series of disconnected phrases.<br /><br />It is shot with a story arc in mind.  Byrne comes to a bare stage alone and does \\"Psycho Killer\\" ostensibly to a ghetto blaster playing the drum machine while Byrne plays acoustic guitar.  As the first numbers progress more of the band and stage equipment is added until the full ensemble and stage is set for \\"Burning Down the House\\".  Byrne notes that his \\"character\\" does evolve over the course of the concert.  Yeah, but we only notice that after multiple viewings.  Most of the time we just enjoy the building of musical intensity and the way the whole thing sounds and looks.<br /><br />The stage antics create the presence for Byrne and the ensemble.  He runs and twitches, and makes what were then very strange gestures.  He explains the derivation of most of them and the iconic BIG SUIT in the commentary audio track.  He also notes that you could also use the film as an exercise video.  If, he says, you do everything he does in the video as hard as he does for as long as he does you will be in pretty good shape by the end of the film.  He seems to be onto something.  It is possible to get winded just watching him do all he does on stage.<br /><br />On the commentary track from the band members and the director, we learn that the movie was put together from performances over several nights.  We learn some of the shooting tricks they used to avoid having any of the seven cameras in the scenes (at least most of the time).  That is, one night they shoot everything from the left, the next night everything from the right, and so forth.  The also note that there are some continuity errors.  While they tried to keep it as true as they could to the live concert experience, they took a balance of the best pictures with the best audio and sometimes that led to things not matching up just right.  There were also some studio over dubs, but as few as possible.<br /><br />It is still a fine concert and a fine film of music making by some very gifted musicians.  And it is a great document from the mid-eighties.  Tina Weymouth notes her \\"blimp suit\\" with the big shoulder pads and so forth.<br /><br />Still very much worth seeing and enjoying.  Who can get enough of \\"Once in a Lifetime\\"?e continuity errors.

A government agency with no regard for our civil liberties, a man whose single minded pursuit of booze and babes leads to his undoing, and a hot blonde chic who never makes love on an empty stomach... and James Mason as a bad man with class.  Hitchcock eases Cary Grant through this role with such cool believability, it make me want to take the train.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Couldn't bear it last night and ran out at the last minute to get Stevie Nick's Best of album, which was just released.  What a lovely compilation!  Really enjoy hearing the duets with Tom Petty and Don Henley.  Also the Cheryl Crow collaboration on the \\"Sorcerer\\" is new and refreshing for me.  Likewise on the \\"Planet of the Universe.\\" Really like the Deep Dish band doing \\"Dreams\\" with Stevie for a different interpretation.  Loved the Led Zeppelin \\"Rock 'n Roll\\" interpretation done by Stevie.  Cool!  (Not to be outdone by the Smashing Pumpkins doing Stevie's \\"Landslide!\\")<br /><br />Some of the liner/booklet notes written or talked about live on the DVD describe the work she did to finish her songs, which is quite amusing.  No doubt a must-have for die hards.<br /><br />Since I have an iPod, I really longed for some remastered songs of hers.  Job well done!  This really hits the mark when I run. I can really rock to this.  Thank you, Stevie!<br /><br />Then the Melbourne Symphony plays for her background on a few of her hits.  Some of the jammin' on that with the orchestra is just far out freakin' neat and never sounded so good.  The last song or grand finale is my fave on this album.<br /><br />This album no doubt will go gold too.

The solos are blazing, the drums are punishing, and the bass is low and angry baby, Goddamn this cd rocks! This is by far their best album, that's right, I said it's better than Burn My Eyes, so what! They have taken the thrash of old school metallica and added some new age anger and spawned one hell of an album. I know there are only eight songs but over half of them are more than nine minutes! If that doesn't remind you of the good ol' days i don't know what will. Buy this cd and support this severely unappreciated band because they deserve glory for sculpting such a punishing, brutal album. Like I said, GODDAMN, this cd rocks!!!!!!
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Bought this album for wife's birthday in early February and have since listned to it at least 50 times. My wife has probably listened to it 500 times by now. We just love it. <br /> <br />To me the appeal lies partly in Nutini's vocal qualities (reminiscent of Paul McCartney), partly on the intelligence of the lyrics (clever rhymes and unusual word choices), and partly the authoritative, graceful arrangements. Each song is a finished work, a burnished gem, not some work-in-progress thrown in to fill space. <br /> <br />Thematically, the songs as a group convey the youthful joy in love and sex, innocence and sincerity, compassion and optimism--much like the best of that golden era of 1967-1973 when most of the really good rock-pop-r&b was being played on the then-new FM stations. Stylistically, I'm hearing The Beatles, Michael Bolton/Otis Redding, and maybe a little of Van Morrison.  In short, it's highly original yet warmly familiar. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are Last Request, These Streets and Millions, but there's not a lemmon in the bunch. I haven't been able to repeatedly listen to an album without getting good and sick of a few of the songs since about 1973. That's why I say it's the best album in decades. My wife and I are looking forward to the next one. I hope his touring schedule isn't making it too difficult to write. If it takes him a while, it will be worth the wait.  <br />

0385340559|5.0|Contrary to what many reader's believe Lee Child is British, but moved with his family from Cumbria to the United States to begin a new career as an American thriller writer. What probably fools a lot of people is that is rare for a British author to be able to write American thrillers with any kind of authenticity. He has won a number of awards with his books and he lives just outside New York City with his American wife Jane. The couple have a grown-up daughter, Ruth and when Lee is not writing he shares his time between music, reader and supporting the New York Yankees.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a loner and has an identity that has been lost in the mists of time. In fact he is the next best thing to the invisible man, apart from the fact that now after the events of September 11th he has to carry photo ID. Even so he is just about as untraceable as a human being living in America can be. So he is more than a little surprised when a member of his old army unit manages to get a message to him. The message is stark and to the point: I want you to put the old army unit back together again . . .<br /><br />Some of Jack's old buddies are in trouble and if you mess with them you mess with Jack and he is like a dog with a bone, he won't let go.
B000001FO4|5.0|Sure, \\"Night Songs\\" did well and Cinderella were already a household name by the time this album came out.  Still, this album produced almost as many MTV hits (remember when MTV actually played videos while people were awake?) as Def Leppard's \\"Hysteria\\", and for good reason.  This disc is a must have for anyone looking for good. bluesy hard rock.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|I can only imagine what many people thought the first time they heard this album, if they were only familiar with \\"Light My Fire,\\" back in early 1967.  Sure, the Beatles were experimental, but their experimentation was with studio tricks, not the songs themselves.  The Doors were the first real rock band to mix two celebrated art forms together, poetry and rock and roll.  This debut album is still today, one of the most brilliant, if startling, debuts in music history. <br /> <br />1. Break On Through (To the Other Side)-5/5.  The Doors' first single was a total flop, but the song itself is absolutely brilliant.  It clearly defined who they were and what it would be like to listen to their music.  The vocals, music and lyrics are all superb.  Great organ by Manzarek. <br />2. Soul Kitchen-5/5.  Excellent soul/blues tribute to something very dear to me (being from Mississippi), southern soul food.  The lyrics are about Morrison wanting to spend all of his time at his favorite southern cooking restaurant. Morrison was also a southerner and you can tell in his passion for the lyrics and music.  Excellent performances by all. <br />3. The Crystal Ship-5/5.  Another classic.  This one appears on every Doors hits collection, although it wasn't released as a single.  The music is slow and mystical.  The lyrics are excellent and Manzarek's piano is remarkable. <br />4. Twentieth Century Fox-4/5.  This one is atypical of the Doors.  The lyrics are simply about a woman who knows she is in control of her man.  The lyrics aren't great and Morrison sings it as if he only half believes it, but the music is great. <br />5. Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)-5/5.  This is a cover song, but I don't know who did it first.  It sounds very Eastern European, like several drunk Germans searching for another watering hole after being kicked out of several already.  It is kind of silly, but a lot of fun and fits in with the album well. <br />6. Light My Fire-5/5.  Not much to say about this song that hasn't been said a million times.  It remains their biggest hit single and the song that casual listeners always know.  The music, particularly Manzarek's organ, is absolutely brilliant.  The lyrics are a perfect mix of melody and poetry.  Simply a classic! <br />7. Back Door Man-5/5.  This is a Willie Dixon cover song.  Rockers in the late 60's, and even more so in the early 70's, loved to cover Willie Dixon.  His blues are very conducive to hard rock music.  The lyrics are typical southern blues, but Morrison sings them like they are his own.  Played perfectly with the Doors' own spin on it. <br />8. I Looked At You-3/5.  This is one of the weaker songs on here.  It isn't anything special.  The music are typical for this time period and the lyrics are simply average.  The main thing that keeps this above water is Morrison's vocals. <br />9. End of the Night-5/5.  I love this song very much.  It is slow and creepy and sounds exactly like a perfect Doors' song should.  Very Indian sounding with some excellent guitar from Krieger.  The lyrics are also phenomenal.  Great song. <br />10. Take It As It Comes-3/5.  This one is similar to \\"I Looked At You.\\"  Nothing special.  Sounds more like Jim Morrison singing with the Animals than the Doors.  The lyrics are okay and he sings well, but it is too typical of 60's rock. <br />11. The End-5/5.  Much has been written about the philosophy behind this song.  Lyrically, there are several themes in it.  The track is over 11 minutes long and explores the darkest depths of the human soul.  The vocals are absolutley perfect.  The music is very slow with Densmore's tribal drumbeats being the standout.  It is simply the best he has ever been.  Perfect song. <br /> <br />Bonus tracks: <br /> <br />12. Moonlight Drive (Version 1)-4/5.  Slightly different version than the one that appeared a few years later.  It is pretty good, but a little flat. <br />13. Moonlight Drive (Version 2)-3/5.  This version sounds kind of hollow.  It isdefinetly missing the meat on its bones.   <br />14. Indian Summer 5/5.  Early recording of a song that later appeared on \\"Morisson Hotel.\\"  No significant difference.  It is an absolutely beautiful song. <br /> <br />All in all, an absolute classic.  This CD has been remixed and remastered, so the sound quality is superb, The liner notes explain that the speed of this album has always been slower than intended, but not by much.  This remaster has fixed that.  On first listen, I didn't notice.  But the second time around, I did notice it.  I believe that this is an all around improvement.  Highly recommended for every person who is a fan of great classic rock.
B0000931QA|5.0|When I first bought this on cassette (dating myself) there was a sticker on the front that equated this album with \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Tommy\\".  Pretty high praise, indeed.  And it lives up to it in every way.  Interestingly enough, the political circumstances that seem to have inspired this concept album have reared their ugly head again (how odd that this was recorded with a Bush in the White House), and that makes this album just as relevant today as it was when it was first released.  If you're a fan of progressive metal, concept albums, or simply mind blowing, blazing metal with an IQ above 50 then this is the perfect disc for you.
B000003TA4|5.0|I was a working musician back when it counted in the sixties and with rare exception that music was much better at communicating emotions than most of the junk out today.  Sorry.  The truth hurts. But this album is a big exception.  I can only take this record in small doses it is so pure and unflinching in its depiction of pain, alienation and misanthropy.  Who can blame Kurt and the boys?  Most of the human race sucks and consciousness is an eternal battle with confusion the self proclaimed victor.  The times themselves shun any other more felicitous conclusion. And who am I to argue with the popular conceit?  The end result may or may not have been Kurt killed himself to get away from this world.  Which is a shame if he couldn't find a way to slip along having a good time on his own terms. I am trying to do so and it is a party over at my house.  But enough about me...The music on this CD is like a hot flame of truth.  Jim Morrison and the Doors never did it better.  More musically perhaps, but never better.  I don't just like this album. I am awed by it. It is ferocious and feral. Just what the times deserve.
B000001F7R|5.0|In almost every interview Joe Elliot has done since about 1987 he says this is his least favorite Def Leppard album.  He's even gone so far as to say he hates it.  I have NO idea why.  It's great.  Better than most of their post \\"Arenalize\\" music, IMO.  You can hear on this album why Def Leppard were originally considered part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (along with Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, et al).  You can also hear the melodic side too, which makes their transition to a \\"pop metal\\" band not all that surprising.  Still, if you like early 80's hard rock, this is one of the best of the first half of the decade.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|great to hear it again. always wanted to buy it again. brings back memories.the first 3 albums were the best.jojo
B000002H97|4.0|It's a bit ironic that Metallica's least heavy release up to that point was the one that made metal mainstream.  Sure the Glam bands had ruled the charts for 1/2 a decade at this point, but that's not really metal.  (Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE fan of nearly everything Glam, Sunset Strip, or \\"Pop Metal\\".)  Still Metallica came along and managed to be the first 80's band that it was still \\"okay\\" to be into after grunge killed the music industry.  This was Metallica's monster album (pun only slightly intended), but it's ironic that it was almost nothing like the four that proceeded it.  I only give this album 4 stars for \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Where ever I May Roam\\", and \\"Unforgiven\\".  The rest is forgetable filler, which is really the first time that type of material showed up on a Metallica record.  I prefer the first three to this, but then again I can remember when Metallica was releasing bootleg recordings on picture discs instead of taking their fans to court.
6302800897|5.0|\\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" is a solid courtroom drama set in the rural Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Shot in stark black and white, AM has an ominous aura from the opening scene.  Ben Gazzara is an Army lieutenant who kills the bar owner who supposedly raped his wife (Lee Remick).  There is no question who committed the murder, only if the act was defensible. Also in doubt is who is telling the complete truth, who deserves sympathy-or punishment- or even if an actual rape occurred.  How consensual was Remick? That Remick is neither the most sympathetic of victims nor Remick/Gazzara the most upstanding couple add to the mystery. The pair is not to be confused with Ozzie and Harriet!  Jimmy Stewart is the small town lawyer who agrees to defend Gazzara. JS bases his case on the slippery premise of temporary insanity. AM soon enough turns into a duel between Jimmy and hot shot mouthpiece George C. Scott-brought up from the \\"big town\\" of Lansing to prosecute BG.  The in court duel between the lawyers is as good as will be found on any silver screen, as is the out of court scramble to produce witnesses and gather evidence. Listen to the infections in Stewart's voice! This reviewer was initially leery of the 160 minute run time, but length is not an issue here. Viewer interest is certain to be maintained. (According to an old \\"Variety\\" review, Director/Producer Otto Preminger insisted on releasing AM quickly, leaving no time to edit or cut). The supporting cast is outstanding, notably Arthur O'Connell and Eve Arden playing Stewart's assistants.  AM received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor (Stewart), Best Supporting Actor (Scott and O'Connell) and Best Adapted Screenplay- all to no avail. 1959 was the year of \\"Ben Hur\\". Tom O'Neil's \\"Movie Awards\\" states \\"the Oscar runways were greased for \\"Ben Hur\\".  Cynics will love AM.  Guilt or innocence is highly subjective here. The final scene with Stewart and O'Connell in the trailer camp where Remick and Gazarra lived is agem. It captures the ambiguity of AM perfectly. On a final note, the black and white format is a huge part of the movie. \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" is one more example of why old b&w movies should never be colorized.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|Just as \\"Batman Begins\\" was a restart for the Batman franchise, so is \\"Casino Royale\\" a reboot for James Bond.  Not only do we have a new Bond in Daniel Craig, but we go back to the first of Ian Fleming's spy novels, long inaccessible because of a copyright issue with the makers of a TV movie.  Like Batman Begins and other reboots of successful franchises, the film is all the more enjoyable: it is familiar yet different, not \\"more of the same\\" which tends to happen in upper sequels. <br /> <br />Just as each actor has re-invented Bond to his own liking, so too does Craig bring a new twist.  Both his and Dalton's Bonds are more edgy and prone to violence (as opposed to the smoothness and womanising of the Moore and Brosnan incarnations).  The story: the young Bond is vying for \\"double-O\\" status (and therefore a license to kill).  He foolishly chases his terrorist quarry into an embassy and gets involved in an international incident.  This leads to my favourite line in the movie, uttered by Judy Dench's M: \\"In the old days, when an agent did something that stupid he had the sense to defect.  Ch**** I miss the Cold War!\\"  One senses that the writers of the Bond films would echo that sentiment.... <br /> <br />Having failed to bring in that terrorist, Bond gets to work trying a different tack to track down the mysterious \\"Le Chiffre\\" - banker to the world's terrorists and banana-republic dictators.  Foolishly, Le Chiffre loses a huge sum of these people's money, and decides to host a high-stakes poker game in an attempt to win the money back.  Unfortunately, there is the usual silliness involved in the poker (in one hand the 4 players have a flush, two full houses, and a straight flush, the odds of which are astronomical, even in Texas Hold-em rules). <br /> <br />But that is one of the few complaints that can be made of the film.  The scriptwriters (including the multi-Oscar nominated Paul Haggis) have a clear vision in mind and execute it well.  Most of the modern Bonds (going back to Moonraker) have been special effect and stunt extravaganzas where the plot often seems to be simply a thread holding together the action sequences.  This film makes the action serve the story.  As such, you're never quite sure what to expect - for example, once Bond finally gets into his Aston Martin for a car chase, it leads to a very unexpected result (if only in its duration). <br /> <br />Granted, the end of the film drags out and introduces a confusing array of extra villians.  But countering that is Craig's performance (and Dench's, for that matter - some of the best moments are M trying to rein in Bond's impulsiveness and violence while trying not to blunt his effectiveness).  I don't know what the most vociferous of Craig's detractors think of his performance, but the final word goes to Rotten Tomatoes, which rated Casino Royale in its top 10 films of the year, based on the number of positive reviews it received.
0618680004|5.0|If the faithful would read this book, they would probably become better people.  It is sad that people use their faith to only the extent that it serves them selfishly. Moral behavior that is thought out and actually does good in the world should be religious but it isn't.  Richard Dawkins is a wonderful writer. I wish people who really, truly believe there is a God and He/She is beneficent would have the faith in that God and God's love for them to read and think and wonder why.
B000001EUN|5.0|Here is the breakdown of this kick-[...] Scorp album. If you like commercial rock, leave this CD alone as it is just a raw and powerful hard rock sampling.<br /><br />1) \\"Make It Real\\" - This is classic Klaus Meine.<br />Rating:  5 stars<br /><br />2) \\"Don't Make No Promises (Your Body Can't Keep)\\"<br />Rating:  5 stars<br /><br />3) \\"Hold Me Tight\\" - This song is OK.  Not an awful song but pretty plain.<br />Rating:  3 stars<br /><br />4) \\"Twentieth Century Man\\" - A cut above \\"Hold Me Tight\\" but not much<br />Rating:  3.5 stars<br /><br />5) \\"Lady Starlight\\" - I like this one. It is a nice ballad that really digs into your soul.  Klaus Meine's vocals flow out and grab you and lets you feel the emotion.  It is superb!<br />Rating:  5 stars<br /><br />6) \\"Falling in Love\\" - This is a really nice ballad that rocks.  It was very close to 5 stars.  I think you will like it.  I do!<br />Rating:  4 stars<br /><br />7) \\"Only A Man\\" - This song starts out like it is going to be crap and then it picks up.  This song is just average, not bad, but not great<br />Rating:  3 stars<br /><br />8) \\"The Zoo\\" - This is the first Scorpion's song that I ever heard.  Of course, it was on the radio that I heard it.  I told a friend of mine about the song (He had just moved back from Germany) and he said that the Scorpions rock and he had been listening to them in Germany for years.  He then turned me on to songs like \\"Speedys Coming\\", \\"He's a woman, She's a Man\\", \\"Backstage Queen\\", \\"Pictured Life\\", \\"In Trance\\", \\"Hell Cat\\", \\"Dark Lady\\", \\"The Sails Of Charon\\", \\"Virgin Killer\\", \\"Robot Man\\", and \\"Steamrock Fever\\".  If you get a chance to buy these songs, do, definitely do.  You won't regret it.<br />Rating: 5 stars<br /><br />9) \\"Animal Magnetism\\" - The guitar at the beginning of this song, draws you in, for lack of a better word, like a magnet.  Then Klaus extends his vocals along with the incessant drumming and before you know it, you are there, in a climatic trance!<br />Rating: 5 stars<br /><br />I hope my review helps!!!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I love this record. John is a poet. He steps up and says things that need to be said. He can play really well. He totally steals from Eric Clapton but he admits it so you have to let him off the hook. If he's good enough to play next to Doyle Bramhall II; he's good enough for me.
B000002UB3|3.0|I have been a Beatles fan since I was 9 in the mid 70's. This record is very good, but for me I have never felt a charge run through me like the first (and recent) times I heard many of the other records, like the White Album. That record has so many dark corners to explore and find light and inspiration in - surprises around every corner. I was thrilled to discover that passion and spirit woven into all of those layers when I was 11, and I still get that way now.    Abbey Road as a group effort is light weight, and their appeal and magnetic attraction lay in their collectiveness, not individual virtuosity. It was the end of the road for them and I don't really hear that their hearts were in it for each other anymore. The band was over. There are great songs - George's and John's mainly. Some songs are corny, others too clever and lacking depth. As individuals it sounds like their hearts were only for their own work. Fair enough, everyone moves on in life and good that they did, but all of the great and clever production can't hide that as a unit they were through. Death was inevitable for them like anything else, so why get hysterical, dream that as a band they never stopped and say it was their best, when it wasn't their prime by a long shot.    However, the Beatles will always be my favorite group and this is a good record. If Let It Be was the band taking its final breath and dying, this is the wake and funeral, an embalmed body, when people who don't know how to mourn and say death isn't fair won't let you go just yet. It had to happen. Best of all, you can hear George and John begin to rise from it more prominently as individuals and move on to their solo careers.    I miss the tension between them that is there when people have a relationship, the friction between them that created sparks. It is like they put on their best behaviour, agree to get along and subsequently go through the motions and make the right noises towards each other. Don't people do that at funerals?    Because of the lack of group heart, and this lack rising up in spite of the clever tricks, I can't give Abbey Road a 5 for a Beatles record. It doesn't give me that thrill. It leaves me thinking that it is good and clever and well done, it is highly professional, but not inspirational. It was the right time to die. They deserve a lot of respect for ending when they could still make decent music and not carrying on and on for the money or fame.    And here I am supposed to say 'buy it!' Do it, pay your respects and say farewell.

B000N6TX1I|2.0|Last month, I read and reviewed the book Children of Men by P. D. James. I knew the movie was coming out (starring one of my favorites - Clive Owen), and I wanted to read the book first. Unfortunately, I think I would have enjoyed the movie much more if I hadn't.<br /><br />There are a few similarities between the book and the movie.<br /><br />~They are both set in the future.<br /><br />~In the future, the human race has stopped reproducing.<br /><br />~There are characters named Theo and Julian.<br /><br />~Theo meets a young pregnant woman and helps her evade the government.<br /><br />That's really all they had in common. The characters are completely different. In the book, Theo is a retired college professor. In the movie, he is a disgruntled office worker. In the book, he has a friend named Jasper who is also a retired college professor. In the movie, his friend Jasper (played by Michael Caine) is a pot-growing hippy ex-activist.<br /><br />In the book, Theo's wife Julian (portrayed by Julianne Moore) is a shallow character who barely makes an appearance. In the movie, Julian is an underground political activist who cons Theo into helping the pregnant girl by offering him 5,000 pounds. In the book, Theo decides to help the girl on principal and because he is drawn to her - not for money.<br /><br />I could go on and on. Why is it that people find a book that they enjoy, think would make a great movie, and then promptly change everything about it? I just don't get it.<br /><br />And more than the character and plotline changes, there is the whole theme of the book: the sacredness of life and how a world divorced from a Christian worldview becomes a place of horror and outrage. The movie becomes a political manifesto of a different sort. In fact, the whole idea that people have stopped reproducing seems to be secondary to the fact that Britain has started deporting all immigrants and has descended into mass chaos.<br /><br />As you can see, I was disappointed in this movie. Perhaps if I hadn't read the book, and didn't know what P. D. James' original vision for the story was, I would have enjoyed it, but I'm not sure. If you are a fan of futuristic sci-fi and haven't read the book, you might enjoy this movie. But if you loved the book as I did, the movie will be a huge let-down.in this movie.

B000KX0IOK|2.0|Ryan Gosling (Daniel Dunne) and Shareeka Epps (Drey) totally convinced me through their gritty, honest performances of both the bleakness of their inner-city surroundings and the tenderness of their difficult teacher-student relationship (further complicated by the latter witnessing the former's drug use).  Anthony Mackie also shone as family friend and self-appointed, dubious watchdog Frank.  However, the acting couldn't salvage a depressing, flat-action, preachy film whose characters were all either pitiable or odious.<br /><br />With very few exceptions (most notably Drey and her single mother), everyone was morally reprehensible, including minor and unexpected characters.  Dunnes' parents embrace their son during a rare visit home and profess admiration for his chosen vocation... until Dad makes offensive racial comments and inappropriate Ebonics jokes.  Frank's girlfriend shows potential as a possible female role model for Drey... until a flash of the camera in one scene reveals the two interacting while Drey weighs and packages drugs for Frank.  And wasn't Dunne himself bad enough as a negligent, America-hating, drug-using burnout?  Did we have to witness him try to force himself on his new girlfriend against her wishes as well?<br /><br />I could handle the realism of the life and characters depicted in Half-Nelson, and I didn't mind the film's slow pace or lack of a real plot line.  What I couldn't stomach was the movie's pretentiousness:  characters committed atrocious acts on a regular basis (using drugs on school property, teaching and driving students under the influence, sending kids to transact drug deals), yet kept their dignity by studying communist propaganda and speaking in Leftist platitudes against the man.  The classroom scenes featured hollow rhetoric about struggles and suppression, emphasizing all the historic events which cast white America in the worst light possible.  Token footage was given to an anti-WMD screed that was out of context, even given Dunne's carefully demonstrated political leanings.  His character was the prototypic far-Left hypocrite, thinking globally while abdicating responsibility locally.ext, even given Dunne's carefully demonstrated political leanings.

B00004YW6I|5.0|Already familiar with PJ Harvey and owning her first 3 albums, it was really difficult to desribe this album upon first listening. It seemed like she had come full circle though, it had all of the familiar elements I had come to expect from this incredible musician/songwriter but it also seemed completely different and new....all at once. It was a paradox but a fantastic paradox nonetheless and it still is hard to describe. It might just be a maturing, I am not sure but whatever it is , this is good music, fabulous songwriting and excellent production. However, I urge one to listen to her earlier albums first in order to get an idea of the progresson of Harvey's music and I think it may put this album into correct persepctive. Or, you could just listen to this album and revel in its uniqueness and ponder why everything else out there is just so bad, wishing you could hear more music like this instead.

B000G03RJA|5.0|The late Laura Branigan had a remarkably worldwide fan base, with several greatest hits albums in countries ranging from South Korea, Brazil, Japan, Germany, and 2 in South Africa (and that was before the U.S. even had one!). <br /> <br />This PLATINUM COLLECTION is the best new compilation of her work since her death in 2004.  While there are a few tracks that are glaringly absent (e.g., \\"Cry Wolf\\", \\"Hold Me\\", \\"Forever Young\\", singles from 1993's OVER MY HEART album, etc.), it is a good selection of her work.  Better yet, these tracks are remastered! <br /> <br />Again, this is not a perfect selection (the ones from South Africa had the best selections), this album is the best one in years, certainly better than the BEST OF BRANIGAN that was released in the U.S. in 1995. <br /> <br />If you must limit yourself to one Branigan album and you do not want shell out the money for the ones from South Africa, the PLATINUM COLLECTION from the U.K. is your best choice!

B00003CWL6|2.0|Five Osars??? This movie got FIVE Oscars? How sad is that? This is the culture we are exporting. This is why they hate us. Okay, I can see that some people like the idea of the poor, put upon patriarch finally standing up to his unappreciative family. Lots of deep, dark, disturbing images - we in America seem to like that sort of thing for some reason. What is it that makes it OK to celebrate old men seducing little girls? Okay, so he doesn't follow through - when she tells him she is actually a virgin. Would it have been okay if she had not been? Does that make it okay that he gets killed? That the only decent relationships the man seems to have is with children? And we're supposed to have COMPASSION for the character?<br /><br />Kevin Spacey has taken some risks with his career, most of which I have great respect for. I have to say this one makes no sense. Sexy naked teenaged girls and images of Annette Bening with her legs in the air may make a lot of money, but there's plenty of that on the Internet.<br /><br />The violence, the homophobia juxtaposed with homosexual imagery that only contributes to the phoniness of what passes for \\"family values\\" - perhaps it is the hypocrisy above all that so many could relate to.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw this movie just so I can say I saw it, given that it seems to be such a cultural icon. Now I can discuss it if I have to. But it's a sad day when a movie likes this says something this important about who we are as a culture. A sad day indeed.

B00005ATQD|1.0|We actually paid money to see this movie in a theater. We sat through the entire thing waiting for it to have some socially redeeming value. We left not only disappointed, but angry. Outraged.<br /><br />Yes, I know what it was about. Of course, I didn't know that going in, that would have been nice. And I couldn't believe the arrogance and the audacity of celebrating a culture of elitism that thrives upon decadence and depravity. Why are we watching this? And WHY ARE WE PAYING FOR IT?<br /><br />It is even more obvious, a handful of years later, that Tom Cruise is \\"not OK.\\" That Nicole Kidman has her own brand of dark drama going on, a drama that is not that far removed from Britney Spears and Anna Nicole Smith. It's larger than life and darker than insanity. We should do something about it. I wish I knew what. But I don't want it with my popcorn.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This CD has become my absolute favorite. Though I don't know DeGraw's writing process, I can imagine many of these songs being born of poems he may have written.  I originally purchased this CD for the song played frequently on the radio entitled \\"I don't wanna be\\".  Though this song is a fantastic song, I found it not nearly the best of the bunch.  DeGraw's voice is so unique and the music different from much of what is played on radio today.  It's a great combination of alternative and rock with a flair all it's own.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|This could have been a good movie, but at 130 min(!!), it was downright <br />dull in several spots, especially a lot of plodding, cutesy conversation <br />between Law and Diaz (neither one can i stand much, and rather smell <br />as actors anyways).  Take out a half hour of that schlock, and the movie <br />could have worked, especially with the funky duo of Winslet and Black (now those are entertainers!).  Actually, the WHOLE MOVIE should have just been about those two, duh!  Why can't i be a producer, \\"with a hit show on broadway, la la la\\". (-:
B000GGSMB2|3.0|When I observe our current American culture and see how many men are obsessed with Scarface, I simply scratch my head. Why is this movie so loved? Is it because it's a rags to riches story? There are a lot of rags to riches stories. Why has this one become such a \\"classic\\"?    The pathetic truth is, many men, especially men in hip hop, enjoy this crap on celluloid because it's brutal, violent, vulgar, and packed with so much testosterone that it should have a toxicity warning label: all of the things that make men feel like men. That and a good steak with a naked stripper on the side I suppose.     Scarface marks the point where Al Pacino began overacting in his films. You certainly can't compare the suaveness, intelligence, and quiet, cool menace of Michael Corleone to Tony Montana who has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It's impossible to believe that an unintelligent, quick-tempered, crazy time-bomb could build an empire of any kind; not even in the drug business where luck and brutality and immorality are the major requirements. And Tony Montana's lack of redeeming qualities as a villain is why he's a terrible central figure to watch. He's a bad guy, but he's not a bad guy you LOVE to hate. He's just a bad guy you hate. He is annoying and unbearable to watch for prolonged periods.    The bad accent, the bad acting, and the bad music all make this an average gangster movie. It does not deserve its prominent status in cinema history.    Bottom Line: A mediocre movie that is more style than substance (Brian DePalma's usual m.o.) It is so caricatured and overdone as to be comedic. Al Pacino has done so much better; and I hope this movie isn't put on his tombstone as one of his crowning achievements. It also scares me how many men idolize the snake character of Tony Montana. They don't seem to get the moral of the story: that when you choose that kind of life, you end up dead in a pathetic fashion. All they see is, \\"he came from nothing, made selling drugs look cool and went out like a warrior!\\"          \\"Don't get mad and don't leave me any stupid messages in the comment box. This is a forum for opinionated reviews, not a forum for agreeing with YOU.\\" --Me
B000JSI7AI|5.0|Loved it. The second disc gives good info about the soundtrack. I enjoyed it. Some of the stuff was the same as on the original disc. I would have liked a little more original info.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, I rented it a week ago and oh my god! I was amazed. A blonde Bond? Makes no difference. This is the origin of James Bond, the calm and collected 007 is yet to be. Daniel Craig is more like a boxer than a secret agent. It might be messy, but he gets the job done. He comes off unrefined, but the action scenes are amazing. Mr. Bond can be quite funny (not the usual cheesy humor). Though not so spectacular, the special features don't detract from the experience, and who buys great movies for special features anyway?
0316172324|5.0|I don't normally write reviews, but this book (actually I bought it as an audio CD) could be the most fascinating piece of literature I have ever listened to.  The information contained within Malcolm Gladwell's expose&eacute; is both enlightening and captivating. I purchased a few other books on mind mechanics and decided on a \\"snap decision\\" to include this work (last) on the list.  Boy, am I glad I did.<br /><br />The concepts which Gladwell presents have, overnight, harnesed themselves into my own cognitive decision-making processes, happily and beneficially.  I think the crux of his research really amounts to whether it is of benefit to make decisions based on a \\"hunch\\" (ba-da-boom-cha) [anyone who has seen Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein might find that allusion funny,]...but back to the point....<br /><br />Upon purchasing this audio CD (which I unequivocally recommend as opposed to the book, as what better way to be stimulated than by listening to a terrific work such as this in the car when you would not normally be doing anything else as productive) I was finding myself tearing up upon hearing what amazingly interesting and insight-reaching information Gladwell has unearthed to draw upon for his work.  I find it absolutely fascinating that, for example, Ted Williams always said he could \\"follow the ball to the point where it made contact with the bat\\" and upon further research, it was revealed, and then pointed out to Ted, that at the last 5 feet of a pitch, it was [italics here for emphasis, please people...] Physically Impossible to manage this given the speed for which the ball was traveling.  And of course Ted's reaction was \\"Well, I guess it just felt like I was following the ball all the way to the bat\\".  That's good stuff.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but gems like this, juxtaposed with Gladwell's own likable and again, the word which comes to mind is 'captivating', reading of the disourse on the CD make this work an absolute must have, a clear-cut leading addition to anyone's Summer Book Club listening list, and for that matter Winter, Spring or Fall.<br /><br />It is indeed rare and delightful when a tome of information such as this bridges the gap between written work to be browsed over and moved aside for the next, and, in contrast, \\"Bink\\", which can be absorbed, digested, and then assimilated into your own behavior patterns, and in doing so making you feel all the wiser and more knowledgable for having begun the process of recognizing and then pinpointing the cognitive processes which make up a chunk of our own mind behaviors at work, given the fact that we all must possibly \\"thin slice\\" numerous times throughout the course of the day without actually knowing we are doing so and that even better still, actually are utilizing a part of our awareness which operates, dare I say, subconsciously, for our own benefit if only we would give it a forum to breathe and become aware of it's time-saving and seemingly omnipitant intelligence.<br /><br />As a note to Mr. Gladwell, I would suggest taking the Blink discovery one step further.  Let's discover what additional components, universally, present themselves as part of significant timetable events, in addition to the \\"hook\\" of the initial telltale information disclosure which seems to exist ubitiquously in connection with querried factual conclusions.<br /><br />Otherwise, what other components do completed factual events share universally, besides the thumbprint of an associated initial informatinal Blink keyhole portending the concluding outcome.  We could learn more about what patterns to look for, what experience comes next after the Blink, we must journey through before arriving at our final conclusion.  There must be a deeper, larger, more fundamentally encompassing mechanism operating behind this Blink story.<br /><br />Well worth the price of admission, I give this work 5 stars and look forward to anything more Mr. Gladwell has on his next \\"to publish\\" list.ding addition to anyone's Summer Book Club listening list, and for that matter Winter, Spring or Fall. <br /> <br />It is indeed rare and delightful when a tome of information such as this bridges the gap between written work to be browsed over and moved aside for the next, and, in contrast, \\"Bink\\", which can be absorbed, digested, and then assimilated into your own behavior patterns, and in doing so making you feel all the wiser and more knowledgable for having begun the process of recognizing and then pinpointing the cognitive processes which make up a chunk of our own mind behaviors at work, given the fact that we all must possibly \\"thin slice\\" numerous times throughout the course of the day without actually knowing we are doing so and that even better still, actually are utilizing a part of our awareness which operates, dare I say, subconsciously, for our own benefit if only we would give it a forum to breathe and become aware of it's time-saving and seemingly omnipitant intelligence. <br /> <br />As a note to Mr. Gladwell, I would suggest taking the Blink discovery one step further.

B000M341QO|3.0|Hot on the heels of enduring,'Elephant', I subjected myself to Scorcese's much vaunted,'Departure'. The common ground of both films is the casual gun murders of numerous people obstructing self-fulfillment. Van Sant stalked his victims from behind, down school corridors suggesting that computer games, shooting targets from behind, fed youthful imaginations bent on violent retribution. Scorcese's thugs, with blurred distinction between police and criminals being its meaning, share the amoral code of Van Sant's teenagers. Conflict resolution equals gunfire. None of this is news. Death as entertainment has a hallowed cinematic history and Scorcese's contribution has been enthusiastically received. Michael Moore's corrective,'Bowling For Columbine' explores U.S.A's fascination with gun culture. The acting quality here is very good: Nicholson deploys a full palette of facial gymnastics, di Caprio is particularly good playing vulnerability - all contribute to the film's weight. But is this a parody? Nicholson's emergence, arms inexplicably besmattered with blood suggest as much.The film is too long by about three or four deaths. Even Leonardo seems unconvinced of the plot when Sheen thwacks the pavement next to him in a pulpy mess. It's laughable.The police shrink, who could have operated as a crucial link in the rife duplicity, or add to the film's moral stance, is insufficiently developed and lacks the sexiness to sustain her male suitors. She secures key information, but remains mute. All the protaginists are stymied by information deficiency and continue to blast their ways through to it. While the others cancel out each other, she survives to slip away below the inquisitorial radar. The final shot of the rat on the railing and the distant, gilded dome, is too contrived for comic relief.

0143038419|5.0|While following the author across the world in pursuit of pleasure, prayer and personal solace, Eat, Pray, Love becomes a chronicle of every woman's own inward journey towards establishing a sense of self. Not a mother, not a wife, not the girl she used to be, Elizabeth Gilbert rejects the false security of a mundane marriage, says farewell to an addicting rebound relationship and must somehow find the courage to climb her way out of a debilitating depression. Gilbert's voyage to self-discovery results in a sort of user-guide for the soul-on-the-mend in three of life's most divine locales, finding transcendent pizza in Italy, enlightenment in India and selfless love on the shores of Indonesia.<br /><br />  Eat, Pray, Love is an enjoyable read, spattered with linguistic anecdotes, geographical trivia, heartwarming characters, and moving personal accounts, as worldly pleasures give way to grounded spiritual devotion, ultimately leading to liberation. In the wake of haughty cuisine, Sanskrit chants, and Balinese birthday parties, both the author and the reader find that no matter where the inward journey of the soul begins the destination is universal.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I have been waiting for this set for over two months now.  After scouring 3 stores before finding a copy of the CD/DVD (Target only had the CD, who would buy that??), I found it at Barnes and Noble.  The CD itself isn't entirely spectacular.  I already have all of the tracks (except for the live versions of Rock n Roll, Edge of 17, and Landslide, and Rhiannon).  The most interesting part about the CD (other than the exceptional live versions, which do differ from previous live versions of these songs), is the sequencing. It's interesting to hear \\"I Can't Wait\\" after \\"Edge...\\" or \\"Planets of the Universe\\" after \\"Stand Back.\\"  I wouldn't have thought to place them in that order.  The most exceptional piece in this package is the DVD.  I love the fact that you can view the videos with or without the commentary.  The home video is a very special treat.  I highly recommend this product.  My only real complaint is, knowing how prolific a songwriter Stevie Nicks is, that there isn't one single new track to speak of.  I agree she needs to kick out some new material; it's great to have her out touring and having a good time, but 6 years is a long enough wait.
B000M5B6Q0|3.0|If you enjoyed the movie and like Hugh Grant's voice you will enjoy this soundtrack.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|My wife and I went to see this on our first night out after our baby was born. It was lovely just to get out, but we hoped to see a good film at the same time. This looked like a good concept and had actors we have appreciated in the past. Wrong move! <br /> <br />The script is terrible. It and the director totally waste the talent of the actors. The movie sprawls all over the place from shallow scene to shallow scene. One ends up not caring at all about any of the characters in the film, let alone sympathizing with them.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most insulting part of the film is the \\"old Hollywood screenwriter guy\\" storyline who laments how \\"they don't make 'em like they used to.\\" Not only does this storyline have no connection whatsoever to the other pieces of the film, but it is in the middle of the perfect example of Hollywood churning out crappy star-driven pictures just to make a buck. <br /> <br />And perhaps just like this review, the film drags on way too long. What a waste of time.
0439813786|5.0|My 8yr old heard me raving about this book to our school librarian at the a Book Fair where it was displayed. He could not wait to check it out, he pestered the Librarian to let him borrow it before she had had chance to catalog it. She could not deny him!! He read it at bedtime and stayed up late due to it for 4 nights in a row. (How can you demand lights out to your once reluctant reader when he's totally enthralled by a huge book like this?) He loved it, thank you Mr Selznick. (We have since purchased our own copy so that we the parents can enjoy a book chat as a family.)
1582701709|4.0|I absolutely love this book. The DVD was better, because I didn't have to read anything. Sitting on my lazy and watching a video is pretty easy stuff. But, the book is literally fantastic too. Thinking about it now, I just want to kiss myself. It's not conceit. The graphics are pretty much at the highest level possible. It blew up my mind. <br /> <br />Within days, I got up off my lazy and wrote a book called \\"The Ancient Secret Code: The Law of Attracting Bleep Loads of Cash, Goodies, Pleasure, Love, Power, Prizes, Riches and Wealth.\\" The irony is that this was all made possible by the secret. That is what is so mysterious and FRIGHTENING. Literally, I'm scared just thinking about it, because it is so real and powerful. <br /> <br />Thank you Oprah. Thank you Rhonda. Thank you Bob.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|[[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series]]  In Dec 2006, I bought UK edition for $42 (amazon,UK) that has David Attenborough as narrator.

The UK version is PAL, 5-disc, subtitles, 10 hours-43 mins running time. The 5th disc should be seen by everybody that discusses saving species and living together.

B0009MAP90|5.0|If you havn't heard this album before you may be put off by how dark it is. But it is my favorite of all Dylan's Albums. True folk music, which gives you a glimpse of his roots.

B000OLV97I|2.0|Although this movie is based loosely on the book, the hour and a half it runs for gives no time to explore all of the nuances of the book's extraordinary adventure.  I loved the book, which was well written and thought out, but the movie has basically butchered Christopher Paolini's great fantasy novel. <br />To do a movie like this, the time frame needs to be similar to Lord of the Rings.  Another hour or so, and this could have been a good movie.  The only reason I gave this two stars is for the dragon and Jeremy Irons. <br />Rent if you still want to see it, don't buy!

As for the new singer Monika, she sounds ok, but need work on her vocals, so she don't sound like a pop singer. As for the music, it has good guitars and drums.

6300216268|5.0|I first saw this at the theatre and during the opening scene, the audience got very quiet.  I, on the other hand, was making a fool of myself laughing out loud.  The irony of the mother scolding harold was perfect.  The audience soon followed with a few polite titters, followed by good natured chuckles but it was way out there for those who hadn't seen it coming.  This was during the hippies, it was an anti-war film, an anti-establishment film and an anti-parental discipline film, all of which appealed to the generation.  Other movies such as The Graduate and MASH had the same fan base.  Fortunately it has aged well and although tame compared to movies that came later, still maintains it's own style & form.  I think it made the top 100 movies ever made list, quite high, around 14 or so.  Bud Cort (Harold) continued to act and was at Groucho Marxs' bedside when that comedic legend died.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Not only is Daniel Craig the best Bond, but this is also one of the best bond movies ever.  Daniel Craig is James Bond on steroids and a whole lot of fun to watch kick [...] and think.

All of the back stories that are involved with Bond's beginning is very interesting for any Bond fan.
0307237699|5.0|This was not my sentiment: Obama records this on page 102 as some well-intended feedback he gets from his Illinois constituents from time to time. But it is a testament to Obama's writing skill that this statement comes across sounding exactly as it reads: an earnest plea from people haplessly longing for the return of some kind of integrity to American politics; the idea that people are supposed to be represented in Washington D.C. rather than corporate interests; the pragmatic yet sad realization that good people have been sent to Washington D.C. before, only to be converted into recipients of corporate lobbyist largesse.<br /><br />Barack Obama is a politician, of this there is no doubt, and based upon this self portrait he has had these ambitions for much of his life. But his words seem to flow with a streak of honesty even as \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" lays out his upcoming presidential campaign. He takes on the issues one by one, in chapters with titles like \\"Faith\\" and \\"Family\\" and \\"Opportunity\\", and walks a narrow centrist line between left and right. It's the middle of the road, yellow stripes, dead armadillos and so on, but Obama's views do not come across as forced or manufactured or patronizing. Rather, his arguments seem to be well-reasoned, practical, and competent, without the excesses of a driven ideology. I suspect that even New Conservatives could read this book without bursting an artery. And as for Liberals? We sense something from Obama that we haven't felt since Jack Kennedy: we sense a personality that can unite us again as one nation. Not someone to preach at us about \\"abstinence\\" or \\"just say no\\", but someone who can lead us back toward greatness.<br /><br />Barack Obama may not win the Democratic nomination, but he will certainly remain on the American political stage for quite some time. This political memoir can provide valuable insights to both the Left and the Right.
B000002C2E|5.0|This is more than a milestone (one of many). This is a genuine historical piece of fiction by a master craftsman.<br /><br />Actually for all involved. Daniel Lanois helped to bring a Bob Dylan statement a new meaning while completely tapping into the essence of the music's core and past.<br /><br />Something which Bob has taken great tongue-in-cheek pride in doing his entire career.<br /><br />A wonderful, stirring, moving and legitimate work of art on all levels. A watermark.
B0000931QA|4.0|A friend recommended this to me and it was surprisingly better than I had expected. This is certainly no \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" by Dream Theater or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" by Pink Floydd (two of my favorite concept albums), but the fact that it is not the best concept album I've heard doesn't mean it is not worth checking out for the great music. It sounds a bit dated, but the story line is interesting (if somewhat convoluted and lacking in originality) and the guitar work delivers when it is needed. Overall, I imagine when this first came out, I would have given it five stars, but it just doesn't stand up as well to the test of time compared to DT or PF concept albums (or even Symphony X or Rush).

0380778556|5.0|Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier drew me in and made me feel like I was there with the characters. When I picked the book up I thought it would be about a girl named Rebecca, but I was wrong. It is about Maxim deWinter and his dead wife Rebecca, and how she still impacts him and his new wife. Another wonderful thing I like about Rebecca is that Ms. DuMaurier doesn't give a name to Maxim's second wife, so I can imagine what I want her name to be.<br /><br /> The de Winters live at Manderly, one of the fanciest mansions in Europe. They held many parties with Rebecca alive, but now with the new wife nobody knows if there will be any parties at all. The de Winters try to have a ball, but their main housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, tries to ruin everything. She tries to ruin everything because she hates Maxim for marrying again, and hates the new Mrs. De Winter for marrying Maxim and trying to take Rebecca's place at Manderly. Will she succeed?<br /><br /> Ms. DuMaurier describes all of her characters in such detail that I was able to receive a mental picture of what they look like. Hearing the thoughts of Mrs. DeWinter, I was able to tell which characters Ms. DuMaurier wanted me to like and dislike.<br /><br /> I give Rebecca five stars.  It grabbed me and I was able to see myself as many of the characters. I was also able to feel the emotions the characters feel, and it drew me in instantly, so much that I didn't want to put it down.

075640407X|5.0|Kvothe is a legend. Pronounced much like the word \\"quothe,\\" his name strikes both fear and awe into the hearts of men. These days, however, he prefers his anonymity in the inconspicuous role of an innkeeper. When a talented scribe crosses his threshold, he reluctantly agrees to tell his tale. It is a saga, one that can be told in no fewer than three days.<br /><br />This is Day One...<br /><br />Growing up among a troupe of actors, Kvothe is unusually bright, a student at heart. After witnessing an arcanist call the wind in self defense, young Kvothe vows to learn the same skills. Forced into destitution by tragedy, his dream is pushed aside in the name of survival.<br /><br />When Kvothe finally gains entry to the famed arcanists' University, he learns that nothing is straightforward, that he must use his street smarts to survive even among scholars. Making friends and enemies is one small aspect to the journey that will lead him to knowledge of his family's murderers.<br /><br />In this debut novel, Patrick Rothfuss presents a new take on fantasy with a bad-boy hero and ruthless villains. While the very beginning starts off a little slow, the action kicks in and takes hold through the remaining pages. Rothfuss writes with the voice of a seasoned author in the creation of setting, tension, and characterization. Fans will enjoy this darkly bright new voice in fantasy.<br /><br />Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer<br /><br />03/22/2007
B000H305U0|4.0|I liked a lot of the songs. However, a lot of the beats were pretty much the same. I bought it because of the song \\"My love\\" and a lot of the other songs sounded like that one somewhat. Overall I thought it was pretty good. I'm not really a Timberlake or wasn't a Timberlake fan probably because I had only heard singles that I liked but never was interested enough to by the whole CD. I like Timbaland so all in all it was a good CD... I would recommend buying it.

0060931671|5.0|This is a great book for first time Pynchon fans because it's relatively short, highly interesting throughout, and keeps a rolling sense of humor.  The adventures of Mrs. Maas are intriguing enough and the writing style flows enough that you can enjoy the book with or without scrutinizing the hefty dosages of post-modern symbolism that comes along with it.  The complex \\"mystery\\" that Oedipa is trying to solve throughout the book is a medium for strange and little known facts about the Pony Express, as well as the postal service.  The line between historic fact and author's fiction is sufficiently obscured to both fascinate the reader and to warrant the book's placement in it's respective genre.  This attribute together with the bewildered ending makes the book both an anthem of Pynchonality as well as an anthem in post-modernism.  if you want to know what post-modernism is, you can do it while having a blast with an entertaining book.  This one convey's the meaning of genre perfectly with the wink and laugh of fine storytelling.<br />J. Lyon Layden<br />The Other Side of Yore

5558765283|2.0|This book was the worst in his series so far. <br /> <br />Loved the first three books he wrote, although it was already obvious that he was in trouble. He just lost control! GRRM has a good imagination, but lacks an \\"inner editor\\".  <br /> <br />He keeps inventing new subplots and characters, spreading your attention so thin that you essentially stop caring about the story. The story arc is broken.  <br /> <br />The most laughable thing about GRRM introducing new characters (even minor ones) is when he crams whole background stories in blocks of a few sentences... while quite a few of these minor characters could be omitted altogether. He seems in love with his own imagination, unable to let go. I don't think it's greed... it's incompetence. <br /> <br />Oh... and GRRM's recommendation on Robin Hobb's \\"Assassin's Quest\\" books: \\"A diamond in a sea of zircons\\" is spot-on... his own writing is definitely one of the zircons. Read Robin Hobb instead.
B000LC3IDI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, in my opinion the best out of the three. Excellent, waiting for the next one......
B000IJ79UW|2.0|I agree with the prior reviewers (Wayne C. Rogers, \\"bass boy\\" music fan), that this totally un-necessary four disc special edition, is nothing more than a pricy repackaging of the Dual-disc 2000 DVD release of \\"Superman: The Movie\\", with a few added bonus features, like the 78 Theatrical release of the film, and the old serials, meant to coincide with the Superman-Mania greeting the video release of \\"Superman Returns.\\"
0739340131|4.0|Came at this backwards, getting to Brooks' 'Handbook' after his magnum opus. Listening to this on a late night drive from New Mexico to Arizona will keep you awake the whole way. Full of horror, social comment, sarcasm and quirky details, 'WORLD WAR Z\\" takes what was once supernatural silliness to an odd level of plausibility. The skills of actors like Mark Hamill, Henry Rollins & Alan Alda (of all people) give this incredible future-history the ring of believability. George Romero must be proud of this red-headed step-child.<br /><br />The Audio Download was no problem at all. Nice source of stuff to feed the iPod.
0757302661|5.0|Once I read the book I had to take the class. The visuals and affirmations are what helped me have a wonderful 7 hour labor. I have never felt more proud of myself than when I birthed my baby with no medication. I could not have done it without HypnoBirthing. Thank you!
0143038419|5.0|I am not quite sure how I chose this book to read as it did not come to me based upon any recommendations.  My only thought can be, as I had just returned from an amazing trip to india that had inspired me to start a journal, I was curious to see what the author's experience was.  I was very pleasantly surprised by her writing style, her insight and the way that I related to everything that she wrote.  Even though I am not currently in a traumatic stage of my life, nor do I have any understanding of depression and the physical and emotional effects that it has, I was able to relate to her story and learn the lessons that she was hoping to share. <br /> <br />I will recommend this book to all my closest friends and have tabbed some of the pages that i would like to go back to at a later date to read again. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.
0671027344|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a cousin when I borrowed his copy of  The Catcher in the Rye. Altough I didn't enjoy reading that one, The Perks of Being a Wallflower was an excellent book. I wish I could think of a whole new word to describe it because excellent isn't enough. This was one of those books where you felt different after you read it. I finished this book and immediatley started reading it again. I took me about 3 hours to read it just because I couldn't wait to read what happened next. I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone, whether they can relate or not because it's just such a wonderful book that makes you laugh and think in the same sentence. It's a must read, though, for someone who's slightly off-center;)

0060832819|5.0|I have read every book Coelho has written and this is one of the best. It is richer and more complex than some of his other books. It, of course, talks about self discovery and love. I had been disappointed in \\"Eleven Minutes\\" but \\"The Zahir\\" ranks with Coelho's great works such as, \\"Veronika Decides to Die\\" and \\"By the River Piedra I Sat and Wept\\".
B000063Y8F|5.0|The Rosle garlic press is a must-have for every cook.  There are three presses now in three family homes...everyone wants one.  It is very finely engineered to extract all of the fresh garlic, it is extremely easy to clean due to the swinging press plate, and it is a nice weight in the hand... I could press for hours.  This is the only and last garlic press you'll ever have to buy for the cook in your life.  Enjoy!
B000NA2776|5.0|How do I count the ways I love this cd?  It's pure bubblegum at it's finest.  It's just so much fun!  I can't help feeling good as I listen to it.  There are so many good tracks I just can't pick a favorite (although \\"Love Today\\" and \\"Any Other World\\" are high up there).  To me it's a very joyful cd that is an instant pick-me-up for those ho-hum days.  In other words, pure bliss!
0765315246|5.0|If you are a fan of Heinlein, you'll love this book. I could hardly put it down.
006441034X|5.0|I'm aware that this is rated as a 6th grade and up read, however it would definately be an appropriate fantasy novel for younger children to read themselves or have read to them.  A good first fantasy and definately a \\"safe\\" one.  As an adult reader I really enjoyed this book, it was a fun, light-hearted romp that has been a pleasure to read and re-read.
B00006RIO7|5.0|mm hmm i love this movie i love this soundtrack...i sing to it all the time...it always gets me going when i go out!! If you like musicals with an upbeat tempo...buy this one! The movie is fun too!...but dont take my word for it!! :)
0743496728|3.0|I like Jodi Picoult books, for the most part, and I looked forward to this one since the subject matter sounded interesting.  It was a good story and the characters were nicely developed, although one thing that completely bugs me about her books is that she always has to toss in a romance.  This time I nailed who was going to get together in the first 50 pages--it was THAT obvious.  Most of the time, the \\"romances\\" are completely unncecessary and contrived. It seems to me that she is trying to pull in some of the gothic novel readers.  If you read this, Ms. Picoult, please stop--I hate romances!  What I like are intelligent novels which this isn't.
B000I5YCCO|3.0|Well i love to listen to this cd when i wanna sing like hardcore...nice sweet songs...and her songs are really hitting home for me...but i love the song 'Teardrops on my Guitar'...i know how it feels to like someon that likes someone else...and watch from the distance..and 'Picture to Burn'...that one is comical...oo and 'Tim McGraw'...sweet...
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a profound movie that I watched again last night because my wife hadn't seen it yet.  This movie is to the 1990's what Blade Runner was to the 1980's, 2001 to the 60's, Forbidden Planet to the 50's, etc.<br /><br />I doubt that I'll write anything that hasn't been written, but I did notice something last night that I hadn't noticed before, and that was the \\"no rules\\" mentioned in the narrative at the end.<br /><br />It struck me as ironic that the way Neo was able to survive and eventually triumph over The Matrix was by learning rules, lots of them.  Didn't he spend an entire day absorbing \\"rules\\" through all those programs that were downloaded into his brain?  He had to do this even though he was already predestined to be \\"the one\\".  He also had to practice and perfect the programming that was downloaded into him.<br /><br />Having a destiny didn't preclude him from having to learn a lot of rules, but Neo got to learn them painlessly while we in the \\"real world\\" have to learn things the hard way, buy studying or practicing something for years.<br /><br />But once we have mastered our subject or discipline, we have \\"freedom\\" that others do not: the freedom to make music, create art, build amazing computer applications, etc.<br /><br />So, whatever The Matrix represents to you, you'll likely not overcome it simply through \\"free your mind\\" and \\"no rules\\", but rather by learning the \\"rules\\" that \\"The Matrix\\" has made for you and then learning and practicing the rules you need in order to defeat it, but that will likely take more than a day of sitting in a chair.
0783226837|5.0|Tremors is a monster movie reminiscent of those old 1950s creature features. The small town of Perfection, Nevada finds its population dwindling due to the menace of underground creatures. The few remaining residents fight for their lives as they're cut off from the rest of civilization.<br /><br />Tremors has become a cult classic over the years and deservedly so. It's a great blend of comedy and horror, and has enough action and one-liners to keep everyone entertained. Kevin Bacon (in his most memorable role) and Fred Ward lead the pack of unlikely heroes including a seismologist (Finn Carter), a gun-loving couple (Michael Gross and Reba McEntire) and a few other helpless souls. The witty script gave the worms a run for their money; the tactics the characters come up with to outrun them are both ingenious and hilarious. Although this movie is a lighthearted one, there are still plenty of suspenseful moments. Ron Underwood brilliantly helms this little film with the hand of a pro; let's face it, in the wrong hands, Tremors might have been a disastrous and forgettable film.<br /><br />If you like left-field comedies, monster movies, horror films or are simply in the mood for a fun flick, Tremors is the way to go. The DVD has a lot of extra features including a making-of, an alternate opening and original ending, and movie trailers. Skip the sequels; they don't have the heart and freshness of the original.
B0007KVM32|5.0|I Girasoli is an antiwar protest. But De Sica protests without needing to stand in the street, and without destroying anything. This is a haunting story of what war can do to the relationship between a man and a woman. At the same time, it is a portrayal of love when love is a gift that survives in spite of all that has happened.
0393317552|5.0|In this thought-provoking and ambitious book, Diamond sets out to explain, in broad terms, how the current human economic, political and social world came to be the way it is. He refutes racist notions of inherent genetic superiority, pointing instead to geographical features, such as oceans, mountain ranges and the positioning of continents. The global distribution of useful plant and animal species is also crucial. This book is wonderfully entertaining, providing many a nugget of fascinating information for the curious. However, Diamond's conclusions are humbling, when one considers the way vast impersonal forces have worked together to shape human history. <br />
0525948023|5.0|I originally read this book about a year ago and it had a huge impact on my life... probably the biggest impact that any book has ever had on my life.  I don't know if the impact had everything to do with who wrote the book and what exactly was said in it, but I think i was just ready for the general idea of awakening and enlightenment at that point in my life.  GREAT BOOK and i recommend it to everyone.  Also the transaction went very smoothly with this seller. Thanks! :)

B000N3ST7A|2.0|While I love Stevie Nicks, this compilation irritates me. First off, I don't understand why they wasted space with  the live tracks. Although they are nice, they just don't fir for me on a greates hits. Thye take up too much room where a couple of her real hits (After the Glitter Fades, Nightbird, Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind all charted on Billboard's Hot 100) could fit. And since they chose to include Silver Springs from Flettwood Mac, where are her other Mac hits-Sara, Gypsy, Seven Wonders etc-it's just a lopsided compilation. Also, for soemone who stepped out on her own from Fleetwood Mac because she wrote so many songs she needed another outlet to get  her music out there, why no new songs? Why not go back and record something from the vaults (which she has done alot of in the past Trouble in Shangri-La from 2001 includes many older songs recorded for the cd) and record something? Seems Stevie no longer has  a burning desire to record, just tour...with anyone who asks.<br /><br />Lastly, for someone who looks as good as Stevie does at 58, it's sad that they chose to use photos for the front and back cover from almost 30 years ago.<br /><br />The dvd version is nice to have for the videos and Stevie's commentaries, but the cd version just doesn't cut it as a best of./greatest hits.
0805066691|5.0|'Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee' is a catalogue of the cowardly betrayals, massacre, outright murder and genocide carried out by the US Government against the Native American population in what is today known as, The United States. It is a well written and documented account of the Native American Indian during the 2nd half of the 19th century. This book is a unique, disturbing but compelling and highly readable historical narrative told with force and clarity, that has changed forever our vision of how the west was really won (stolen). Unlike other histories covering these topics, the book presents the events as experienced by the victims. It has been estimated there were at least 10 million Native Americans killed, some estimates place this figure much higher. We will never really know the true number. There were many hundreds of tribes spanning the entire length of the western hemisphere, from Alaska all the way to the southern part of Chile. These tribes were inde-and interdependent of one another. Taking into account the natives from these a geographical areas, the number of dead could be upwards of 40 million. Though this book only limits itself to the lower 48's, one quickly realizes that the aim of the government was to destroy an entire non-anglo culture and drive them to complete extinction if need be.  The main sources for the history are official records of U.S.-Indian treaty councils and meetings. The reasonableness and humanity expressed by the American Indian spokesmen during these encounters, as recounted here, do much to counter the stereotype of \\"ignorant,\\" \\"savage\\" Indians, and the courageous spirit they reveal evokes admiration and respect. Chapters are arranged chronologically, each devoted to a particular tribe or campaign. The final chapter describes the growth and significance of the Ghost Dance movement and the Battle of Wounded Knee. Maps show the location and dates of the main actions.   This side of the story was never taught in school. Ahighly recommended book and unlike anything you may have ever read.
B000N3ST8O|2.0|She needs to get off her butt and record something new, and I don't mean recycled old songs in concert. Apparantly Stevie no longer has the burning desire to record her songs anymore, the initial reason she stepped away from Fleetwood Mac in 1981, because she supposedly wrote so much music. That appears to be no longer true. The live versions waaste space. Do we really need more live versions of Rhiannon, Landslide & Edge of Seventeen? No.
B00005JPMC|2.0|This movie takes a few elements from Hunter's \\"Point of Impact\\" (major characters, one or two plot threads) and rewrites or discards the rest, resulting in an entirely different and lesser creation.<br /><br />I despise the central theme of this message movie: Governments are hopelessly corrupt and that hidden forces really control the government (evil white industrialists usually). The implied solution to evil government and injustice is private vendetta. Lethal force may be necessary under extraordinary circumstances--war, self-defense or defense of a third party. Much of what Swagger does is a legitimate use of force. But he departs from character at the end, a radical rewrite of POI.<br /><br />Many important supporting characters and subplots are reconstructed or gone. Nick Memphis' character is recast as a geek of Mexican (or Filipino) extraction; that's ok. However, he pales in comparision to the other Nick Memphis; his sad history, redemption and triumph are gone. Instead we get cliches and conspiracies: \\"No WMD in Iraq\\"; \\"It's all about Oil (not answering Islamic terror)\\"; evil fat, Haliberton-esque Montana Senator; good, but ineffective, executive branch and US Attorneys; bad Congress and its secret operatives (evil Serbian sniper). Was this script written during the Clinton years, or is it looking forward to Obama?<br /><br />The movie also pretty much trashes the prospects of a sequal when it changed the historical context of POI from Vietnam to Africa. Donny's death was not by a helicopter gunship (see \\"Time to Hunt\\" to find out by whom). The whole chemistry/relationship between Donny's widow and Bob Lee Swagger is lost. I guess Hollywood considers it too corny for the guy to get the girl of his dreams and justice for his dead buddy.<br /><br />However, the gun fiction is what really kills it for me: A Dinty Moore Beef Stew can at 1 mile (1760 yards), a head shot at 2000 yards (.25 MOA!), 1.5\\" group at 1000 yards. Even benchrest guns are hard pressed to shoot 0.15\\" 10-shot groups at 100 yards. The current 1000 yard 50BMG \\"heavy\\" rifle (approx. 50 bls) record 5-shot group size is 2.6\\". Add the environment out to 1000 yards, supported prone with a high-power rifle (14 lbs), group size gets dramatically bigger.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot--even the lowly .22lr is a miraculous sniping cartridge capable of head shots while \\"suppressed\\" at 200 yards! I admit, even Hunter elaborates on what is possible, but the long range precision featured in this movie is absurd.<br /><br />This is not POI. It really misses the mark: off target, left.00 yards.

B000063Y8F|3.0|My daughter raved about the Rosle Garlic Press.  And the reviews were equally outstanding.  Unfortunately, while pressing the 4th garlic clove, the press flew apart.  I sent it back requesting a replacement.  The reviews were so good that I had discarded the original packaging which Amazon had requested that I use to return the product.  So, good luck and good pressing.  I'm willing to give it another try based on my initial good experience and the reviews of others.

B000EHRVP6|3.0|I am glad this film was made , it will open the door for more horror films to be released in the mainstream with good budgets. The movie was good the story was good, i loved watching it once, but since the first 45 minutes has nothing but character development, i don't think i could watch the whole thing again, just the second half. The whole pay to torture somebody idea was great ,,, you will never run out of enemies for sequels.<br /><br />  the movie has too much beginning,,,,,
B00005JNQS|3.0|When there's robots in a film, I usually like it. Robin Williams is also pretty interesting. Still, \\"Robots\\" isn't exactly my favorite computer animated film. I think it's got an interesting look though. The shine on everything, particularly. Among the special features is an audio commentary, though it's pretty technical, the animation crew describing their innovations and such while making the film. Kind of similar to the themes of the film, actually, making the most of what you have and inventing things when there is a need. There's a lot of that in the plot, about a young robot going to find his fortune, and who he is, in the big Robot City.
B00005JO20|2.0|This movie was screwed up all the way from beginning to end.<br />1. no kong for one hour n ten minutes,,,so kids lose interest quick<br />2. CGI sucked,,man running from dinosaurs and ground is moving at a different rate than he is, depth of characters standing next to monsters is way out of proportion, kong is different sizes in different scenes<br />  ( CGI could be great, but it is taking the heart out of movies.)<br />3. How did kong know where to go ice skating in new york?\\"KONG ICE SKATING\\" LOLOLOLOLOLOLHAAHAAHAAH<br />4. Why does the girl take up for kong when he is killing all those people in new york,,, it reminds me of all the women standing behin their men in prison.<br />5. Unbelievable that kong can fight off dinosaurs while taking so many bites, he should have been torn to shreds.<br />6. the primitives look like white people painted black, or burnt in an oven,,(i am sure the old tribal lady is giving everyone the middle finger)<br />7.way too long.........................................................<br />8. i did not feel sorry for this kong,,,he knocks this girl around quite often on the island and kills several people in new york....<br />9. Too many monsters...for a moment i thought it was a remake of jurassic park until the giant bees came out<br />10. the military had a total lack of public safety, just firing rockets and bullets blindly in kong's direction,,,was there no military training in 1933.<br />  The only good thing was the depiction of the poor people in depression era new york, but really is that why we wanted to watch king kong.
B00005JPLU|3.0|Nice computer compositing work.<br /><br />The action was OK.  But one would have hoped they read the Iliad, which has greek warfare scenes that make 300 look G-rated.  One would have hoped that they watched the 7Samurai or read Outlaws of the Marsh - both stories have more more entertaining depictions of asymetrical warfare.  One would have hope the film makers had watched Richard the 3rd.  etc.<br /><br />The film makers seem to have been inspired by football.  SO if you like foot ball, and wish that football players had to charge head to head with elephants...  youre in luck.<br /><br />In the past Iranian Americans have dealt with racist anti-Iranian paranoia by referring to themselves as persian.  But 300 makes \\"Persian\\" sound like \\"gay goblin\\" - so now Iranian Americans are calling themselves Iranian Americans.  almost funny.
B000G73U5Y|4.0|As many have already stated and I agree as well, the \\"Show Biz Kids- Steely Dan Story 1972-1980\\" is a much better choice. And for a buck or two more you get 33 tunes on two discs which includes all the songs on the \\"Definitive Collection\\"(less the two new reunion songs)plus lots of other must have's from the Big Steel D.

B000AYEIZY|2.0|I saw them live, I have all the Original LP's I watched the 1968 concert on the BBC. This offering is far removed from the way I remember them. All of cream are the same age as I am, and it showed. Poor Jack was recovering from surgery and has lost is voice and stamina. Ginger was subdued but who would have expected him to still be alive. Eric, well he was just going through the motions. But the biggest criticism, as mentioned by others, was Clapton using the strat' instead of the Les Paul Gibson. They just didn't sound right. Having said this, it's Cream I bought the CD anyway.
0060594896|5.0|I am a big Jack Canfield fan as I find him to be (1) one of the most genuine self-improvement speakers/authors, and (2) a great story teller. So I wasn't surprised when I liked this book upon my first reading.<br /><br />It wasn't until I went back to the book, a couple of times, that I began to understand the full power of the book. Whenever I open randomly to a page, I find wisdom that more often than not \\"speaks\\" to me about some business or personal issue that I am having.  Not that the book magically solves my issue, but it does unlock creativity that routinely brings new perspectives on an issue.<br /><br />This has become one of my top five self-improvment books of all time. It really is that powerful, at least for me. Critics will contend it is a rehash of tried (but true) words of wisdom.  For me, Jack has effectively synethized success principles into a tool that just keeps on giving.
B00007K02F|3.0|I'd better confess that I'm a Jane Eyre fan since I was a child, having read the book several times.  I can practically recite passages by heart.  I have a small collection of every version of this story I have found.  I keep hoping that I will find the right combination of actors and script... I'm still waiting.<br /><br />Zeffirelli obviously had some money to spend on this production, and managed to get some very good people to play the respective parts - they LOOKED like they were supposed to look - but even all dressed up in good costumes with great cinematography, the movie doesn't go where it should.<br /><br />Of course, it would be impossible to condense Bronte's novel into 2 hours and convey the stark psychological drama that is the major theme of the work.  The script is actually well done all things considered.  A friend who watched it with me and didn't know the book liked it well enough.  But there was a sad lack of passion in the grown up Jane and William Hurt just wasn't rakish enough.<br /><br />I was also very disappointed with the \\"meet the mad wife\\" scene.  I don't think I have ever seen this rendered as it ought to be, a descent into Hell and damnation and horror.  Zeffirelli's  rendering was even weaker than others.  I suppose that the madness was supposed to be conveyed in the eyes or something, but it was lost on me just like Jane's passion and Rochester's recklessness was so absent due to under-acting.<br /><br />As I said, Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt really looked the parts, they just weren't up to playing them.  Probably the best acting in the whole movie was by Geraldine Chaplin as Miss Scatcherd at Lowood school and John Wood as Mr. Brocklehurst.  They were really fiendishly evil.<br /><br />I just wish that with all the effort put into the arranging of the movie, they had put a bit more into ACTING!
B000MM0L2S|2.0|Not that I'm a total die-hard fan, but I spent several years collecting the most obscure Morricone soundtracks I could find. And I just saw him perform at the United Nations and Radio City Music Hall in February 2007. Initially, I had high hopes for this CD. Those hopes didn't last much into the first listen... <br /> <br />This tribute album is cover versions of only (arguably) his most popular songs. The covers on this album pale, in general, to the originals. Some are just plain emotionless. Celine Dion and Metallica in particular manage to suck the life out of Morricone's originals.  As cover versions, they're vulgar. But that's part and parcel of the Morricone catalog; in over 400 soundtracks, you will find as much beauty as you will vulgarity.  In that respect, this CD might still represent his body of work even if it doesn't translate it very well. There is some good, some bad, and some just ugly. <br /> <br />We may all love Morricone, but we do not all love to hear his work treated the way some of these artists chose to treat it. If you're like me, you'll prefer to spend your money on Morricone's original works (though a few do appear on this CD). I recommend \\"Crime and Dissonance\\", a compilation of Morricone music curated by Mike Patton, released on Patton's Ipecac label.
0465043577|3.0|This book aptly points out flaws in the common methodologies for modeling the dynamics of markets.  (In fact, it points them out, over, and over again throughout the book.)  However, the book offers no solutions.  Rather, its goal is to bring these flaws to the attention of readers who, presumably, will then be motivated to develop improved methodologies if they are researchers or, if they are practitioners, at least be made aware of the limitations.  That goal is sufficient, I suppose, to warrant the writing of the book; it is indeed important to know the limitations of the models one is using to make decisions.  However, I found the many re-iterations of the problem with no solution offered to be slightly frustrating.  Among solutions, most notably absent was a solution from the field of fractals, which I was somewhat expecting given that the main author is given credit with inventing that field.

B000N3SS80|3.0|Well, obviously we know that J-Lo is a smart business lady. She has the best of both worlds. Even though she is still very hot and is very much capable of competing with the Best, she is aware that the younger talent and generation is right behind her. The American audience appreciates J-Lo's sense of style and the excitement she brings to the stage when she entertains and does her thing on stage. She is an international star. The Latino community and European community will embrace her and love her forever - no doubt about that. Now to the nitty gritty. Vocally we know she is not a Christina, but I like the way she is able to flip it. English/Spanish it doesn't make a difference. Jennifer you are a FLY-GYRL and always will be. Keep on doin' your thang! Her longevity is in her roots.

0618680004|2.0|Interesting read.  But... <br /> <br />We are finite, therefore, if there is a God, he has to be finite. This is the first failed premise of R. Dawkins' book.  <br /> <br />Where do we come up with the idea that everything has to have a beginning and an end? Could there possibly be realms, or realities, where there is no time, where things or beings just \\"exist\\" and have always existed? Could it be possible that these beings have created a universe where they choose not to reveal themselves to their creation, for whatever reason?  Surely such a being can keep us from \\"proving\\" his existense if he so chooses. To say that something does not exist simply because we cannot see it or feel it is very naive.  <br /> <br />It takes a lot more faith to believe that everything spouted from nothing, than to believe that an infinite being made something finite. <br /> <br />Surely this being finds it amusing how we argue the unarguable. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00004YTXH|3.0|I recently learned that Ennio Morricone had written some songs that I dearly loved.  However, when I purchased the CD, I thought the music was  grainy - like it was recorded off of an old soundtrack.  I have heard better renditions.
B000063V8S|5.0|La serie ha sido una de mis favoritas desde que sali&oacute; al aire. Simplemente se ha convertido en un art&iacute;culo de colecci&oacute;n. El empaque esta muy padre y mucho mejor al que se vende localmente.<br /><br />Para aquellos que crecimos con Star Trek TNG, la serie nos hace recordar a Data y su deseo de ser humano (un pinocho del Siglo 24), al primer encuentro con los Borg causado por Q (que se cuece aparte), a Guinan (ya no me acordaba que Goopie era parte del elenco), al Capitan Picard y sus buenas lecciones de mando y a todos los demas. La idea propuesta por la serie de como ser&iacute;a el futuro de la humanidad y lo padre que debe ser explorar el universo en busca de nuevas experiencias es lo que siempre me ha motivado a seguirla.<br /><br />En conclusi&oacute;n, una serie que no puede faltar en la videoteca de los amantes a la ciencia ficci&oacute;n.

B000C65Z1G|4.0|The Constant Gardener is a film that explores many themes; marriage, faith, love, greed, poverty, and cultural differences.  The cinematography of Africa and all of its beauty and humanity are emotionally captured.  The plot involving British intellegence, corporate pharmaceutical capitalism, and African societal explotation are melded together.  This aspect of the film is confusing.  It is often difficult to identify which characters are agents, spys, doctors, dignitaries, politicians, and murderers. What is beautifully crafted is the relationship that exists between Dr. Quale ( Ralph Fiennes) and his activist wife Tessa ( Rachael Weisz).  After Tessa's death Dr. Quale comes to the realization that his doubts and suspicions concerning his wife were unfounded.  In reality he learns more about his wife's inner soul after he researches the causes of her death. The ending of the movie was moving.
B00006I53S|3.0|This lens has been my workhorse for the past two years.  I have dragged this lens through the rain forests of the Amazon, backpacked with it in Europe and hiked with it in New Zealand.  The lens locks into focus very quickly and the image stabilization works quite well.  When I first got the lens, I played with turning off the IS and then taking the same photo with the IS and I found that with the IS I could get the same quality photo at a slower shutter speed if need be.   <br /> <br />However, that all being said, this lens does suffer from some problems.  A friend of mine and my sister also have this lens and two of our lenses arrived out of the box feeling quite loose.  While holding the camera body with one hand and the end of the lens with the other, you could move the end of the lens about an alarming amount.  I am not sure if other owners have this same problem or if it is just normal.  Or maybe the looseness has just gotten worse over the past two years due to use. <br /> <br />The biggest problem with this lens is dust in the lens.  Google this lens +dust and see how many people out there are complaining that this lens sucks dust into the body due to the extending piston design.  If I hold this lens upside down after it spends some time in my camera bag, I can see dust all over the inside of the lens.  I am not taking photos with a lens that I know produces spots and may be pumping the dust into my SLR body.  After only two years, I am now forced with the choice of returning the lens to Canon to be cleaned or writing off the lens.  Canon can not tell me how much the cleaning will cost until I send it to them.  However, I will have to pay $40 for their time making the estimate if I decide that the repairs are too costly.   <br /> <br />Despite the problems, unless you have the money for an L lens, get this lens because it is fantastic.  Based on my budget at the time, I would not hesitate to get this lens again despite the problems.  But, if you want a lensthat will last longer and is much better, spend the extra money on an L. <br />
B00005JPCF|2.0|Beautiful animation. Some good music. A few funny and entertaining scenes. At times, beats the viewer about the head and shoulders with it's anit-religion and environmental messages. Not in the same league as 'Cars', which should have won the best animated movie Oscar. However, it had a message that the academy members found agreeable, so the better movie was ignored in the name of political correctness.
1932100385|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who eats a primarily plant based diet with some occasional animal foods like fish and lean meats.    I read this book after reading another book which was highly recommended [[ASIN:0312338058 Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right]]    I think that this book has many valid points and I am impressed with the amount of research and studies cited.  And even though I found this book to be a bit too repetitive (eat plants, but no meat) - the vegan lifestyle is in my opinion is an extreme conclusion.      In reality after reading this book I am certain of the nutritional value of a mostly plant diet which it outlines well, as I plan to consume more plant based foods.  However I am not convinced about the role of animal protein being a cancer promoter partly because of arguments presented on several sites I visited.      [...]    I would be interested to read Dr. Campbell's scientific based response to the statements in the 2nd link labeled China Study Redux.      But I am somewhat disappointed because some of the rebuttals make sense as well and warrant more research.       Also I realized something else: There is no limit to the number of studies drawing similar as well as opposite conclusions and one could very well write a book that draws a conclusion to \\"eat meat because it's good for you\\" while citing studies that prove the theory.  I think that is the conclusions from books by Uffe Ravnskov and others citing our understanding of Cholesterol to be invalid,  while I didn't read the books yet, I am planning on looking into this further.    So why all the confusion?  Maybe it's like Dr Campbell said in his book.  The industry pushes the studies that will prove their side of the story.    Meat industry wants you to eat more meat, Milk industry wants us to drink more milk,  and undoubtedly Veggie Farmers want us to eat more veggies.    So back to my assessment of this book - it's a book worth reading but it does not have the whole picture. I am left with some answers but more questions and maybe that is a good thing.    There is an old saying \\"Live 100 years, learn 100 years\\"    I wish you long life of health and prosperity, thanks for reading.
B0007WPJBQ|4.0|The story behind ONE-EYED JACKS appears to have been almost as interesting as the plot which unfolds on the screen.  Rod \\"The Twilight Zone\\" Serling wrote a rejected treatment of the book this film was based on.  The original director attached to the project was none other than a young Stanley Kubrick.  Eventually, the star and director ended up being the same person -- Marlon Brando.  The film reunited him with co-star Karl Malden; the pair having had worked together before in the classic ON THE WATERFRONT. <br /> <br />So dark is this story, that even Slim Pickens is playing a manipulative bum with few redeeming characteristics.  ONE-EYED JACKS is basically a story of betrayal -- a topic it explores right from the film's opening set piece.  Trapped, and with only one person able to escape, Karl Malden's character promises to seek help quickly and return to save Marlon Brando from the law.  Instead he takes their stolen loot and makes a run for it. <br /> <br />Brando spends the next five years in prison because of this and most of that time he broods over his betrayal at the hands of a man he nicknamed \\"Dad\\".  No doubt the fact that Brando himself manipulated the game of chance which sent Malden off as the one to find  help ate away at him.  Once escaping prison, he quickly meets up with another band of outlaws.  But their plans of more bank heists are secondary.  Brando is more interested in revenge.  He quickly catches up with Malden, but instead of exacting his vengeance quickly, he picks a more protracted method.  Favoring to pretend there are no hard feelings, he bides his time in order to heighten his former partner's suffering. <br /> <br />It's almost wearying to watch this unfold.  Brando cheerfully proclaims that he bears no malice, but covertly plans his revenge.  Malden swears he trusts Brando, but has machinations of his own.  The audience must simply watch as these two men get deeper and deeper into their own games. <br /> <br />What's delicious about this movie is that you can connect a line between every individual character and each person they encounter.  And almost every single one of those lines draws a deceitful relationship.  Brando deceives Malden, Malden's daughter and every woman he meets.  Malden lies to Brando and his own family.  Malden's daughter hides the truth from her father.  Slim Pickens tries double crossing everyone he meets.  It's dizzying to keep up with what the actual reality of the film is. <br /> <br />As far as revenge films goes, this is good, but not great.  The vengeance is interesting to watch from the point of view of the audience, yet it's not quite as engaging as it could have been.  I felt simultaneously intrigued and removed from the action. <br /> <br />Where the film does get a boost though is from the performances of the two stars.  This shouldn't be a surprise.  Even in places where the script drags, watching Malden and Brando as they plot and scheme with each other while also trying to figure out the other guy's motivation is always fun. <br /> <br />The Digiview Productions edition of this film is presented in widescreen.  The picture and sound quality are more than adequate, although they could definitely benefit from some digital cleanup. <br />  <br />If you like movies where the only characters with redeeming qualities are given less than half a dozen lines each, then ONE EYED JACKS should be right up your alley.  But you might want to draw a flow-chart while watching so that you can keep track of everyone's ulterior motives.

1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone is the autistic protagonist of this book.  Christopher likes routine, mathematics, dogs, and Sherlock Holmes novels.  When his neighbor's dog is murdered, and he is incorrectly suspected as the killer, he decides to find out who did it, Sherlock-style, in both solving the mystery and writing it down.  This reflexive style is fascinating- I love Christopher's perspective on not understanding facial expressions, idiomatic expressions like \\"raining cats and dogs,\\" and the way he spends idle time by solving math problems in his head, and actually including said problems in the text.  The book even has an appendix to show how he solved a particularly difficult question from an academic test he takes.  Christopher also deviates from the story line sometimes, usually in order to make an extended metaphor, and gives you interesting scientific or historical tidbits that were also fun to read.  This book is great.  I loved it.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This movie is a great one for those wanting an interesting, well-done romance.  All the characters are very likeable (even the \\"evil\\" ones), and you wish them all the best.  Jack Black is a great leading man -- not all romantic \\"hunks\\" have to be skinny.  I absolutely loved him in this and in King Kong, as well as a few other movies where he hasn't been playing a complete idiot.  He could well carry a serious movie by himself -- but I believe his forte should be romantic comedies like this one.
141694740X|3.0|So, ladies, remember the episode of \\"Sex & The City\\" where Miranda realizes a guy just isn't that into her and is totally liberated? Two contributers to the show expanded upon the idea and made a book of it. This book basically tries to beat it into your head that if a guy really wants to sleep with you, he will make an effort. You don't have to try. If he likes you, he'll call (when he says he will), he'll want to be around you all the time (no matter how busy he is), he won't care that he just got out of a relationship / has committment issues, he'll try very hard to sleep with you, and he will ask you to marry him. I like the idea of it, but is a book really necessary? The mantra itself was probably enough. This book outlines all the ways girls try to weasel and say a guy is into them when he's not. I wouldn't bother with this one, unless you're bored or intrigued (or if you have a jerk boyfriend), but try to just remember the concept and apply it as needed.
1881273156|5.0|The five languages  of love is a very enlightening book. I found it very helpful because I now am able to recognize how people have different \\"love languages\\" in which they  express themselves and if one becomes \\"fluent\\", there is less  miscommunication and more harmony when relating. It was fun to find out which  is my personal love language!!  <br />Another book that I found helps transform  relationships in a magical way, is \\"How to Create a Magical Relationship\\" by  Ariel and Shya Kane.  With humor and compassion they guide the reader thru the  pitfalls of relationship, and like magic, one starts experiencing more fulfilling and passionate relationships -  including the one with yourself. I  highly recommend it.

Bill, now a 36 year old expatriate, decides to retrace these trips to recapture the whimsical, nostalgic memories of his 1950s childhood.  Bill's narration is definitely funny and spot-on.  I couldn't help but hold my breath until he got to towns I'd been to or knew of, to see how his brain interpreted it.

0345350499|4.0|I couldn't wait to be finished with this book until I finished it, and then I was really sad.  It's over 900 pages, so settle in.  This epic Arthurian tale is from the female perspective and has much to do with love, religion, and kingcraft through a few different generations.  It beautifully features orgies, heresy, gay and lesbian love, time warps, gruesome deaths, lots of adultery, threesomes, and love triangles.  Gwenwyfar is overzealous and unintelligent, Morgaine is the star-crossed villain who is resigned to deny her heart and only serve her religion, Arthur's secret is that he wants only to please everyone else, and Lancelet is only strong enough to be a little bit bad, which is worse than being all the way bad.  There are dozens of other characters too, and the author is talented enough to distinguish them pretty well.  I also like the perspective on medieval life- they only eat cheese, bread and meat, for instance, even the royal women are illiterate, and their culture is slowly being integrated with Roman ideals and Christian beliefs.  This precarious keeping of balance between varying religions, genders, loves, lands, and warring tribes all has an underlying promotion of moderation and equality.

0440241413|2.0|This is the first in the Shopaholic series. Rebecca Bloomwood has a very serious problem. She can't stop shopping. She has crazy money issues, and literally just hides her bills in a drawer and goes and shops more to make herself feel better. This novel takes place in Britain, where Bex (her nickname) spends all of her money earned as a financial journalist on the latest designer clothes. PS she knows nothing about finance, which adds humor as she bumbles her way through the work day in order to attend another press meeting that serves free champagne. The irony of her job and compulsion are cute, and Bex really means well, but honestly, can't you just cut up the credit card? How hard is it to not buy more sweaters? I'd only recommend this book if you're a big shopper, because that's the fun part. Otherwise, it's hard to like Rebecca because she comes across as irresponsible, endlessly without any willpower, and materialistic as they come. That said, I still must confess that I also read Shopaholic Ties the Knot and Shopaholic & Sister.

0060012234|4.0|Russel is in high school, and secretly gay.  He keeps it a secret because he's sure no one else is gay.  But, after discovering a gay classmate in a chat room, the two band together with other gay classmates in a group called The Geography Club, purposefully named so that no other students will want to join because they figure Geography is as boring as it gets.  This paradise for the closeted gay students quickly bonds the students, as they open up and learn more about each other and themselves.  Soon, though, this halfway point between \\"in\\" an \\"out\\" becomes a problem, and problems crop up in these new friendships.  This book is a well-written example of YA literature with a gay protagonist.  Russel is likeable and funny, and I like that he shows how easy it is to be both masculine and gay.  I think this would be a great book both for gay teens, and for teens that come from homophobic backgrounds, to show them how easy it is to relate to a gay teen.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I saw the movie in December and again last week on PPV but have not read the book. With that said I really love it, if you can love a movie about the death of the human race. I thought the movie was well paced, slowing only to develop characters and provide vital background info to the audience. I thought for the most part the plot was well developed and plausable. I didn't want to know everything about how this society could function, or why they were against immigration, after all if you have no children wouldn't you want a pool of new immigrants to help farm the land and work in the factories? I guess they had to make a decision and theirs was no Fugees, society will just crumble while the Anglo Saxon core of Britain keeps the upper lip very stiff. <br /> <br />I liked the Theo character, appropriately named (Gift of God) as I kind of thought the characters reminded me of the Gospels. Kee was the modern Mary and the Human Project the standin for the Holy Spirit. Not that they made her pregnant, but they will guard and protect her so that her child will live and help change the world and give hope to the world. <br /> <br />I don't want to provide spoilers, but one scene really made me laugh. Not Haha that was funny laugh, but OMG I love it laugh. It was when Theo and Kee try to navigate their way through the Refugee City and they have to pass through a very Hamas like funeral, complete with black masks and AK 47s. Once I saw them in the camp I thought to myself, this is really well thought out. <br /> <br />BTW, I thought the action scenes in the Refugee City was great. Some of the best choreographed combat sequences you will see in any major studio action film. <br /> <br />I think this film works well in the post apocalyptic film genre. This film would make a good double flick night with Soylent Green (too many damn people), or Zardoz (British elites live immortal lives while the destroyers butcher all others) <br /> <br />I agree with other reviewers that themusic helped frame the scenes of this movie, and the characters were developed fairly well (except the brief Julienne Moore). I thought the rascally Michael Caine was wonderful. <br /> <br />I feel once you see this movie you will end up watching it again and again to see the layers of detail in the story. I highly recommend this movie.

B000002NJM|5.0|This CD has a lot of good music and in the order it was in the movie. I like this one and have listened to it more than a few times.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This one is a classic.  It will be impossible to make another movie like this one.  It is all real, the actors drove real cars on real tracks during the racing season.  Many scenes were shot at real grand prix races, and has cameos from famous Grand Prix drivers such as Graham Hill and others. <br /> <br />No other racing movie compares.  Because of safety restrictions and actor liabilities, a movie like this would have to be filmed with a lot of green screen and computer generation. <br /> <br />So if you are a true racing fan, in its purest and original form, you've got to own this one.

B00006JDVV|5.0|This is a good movie if you like action and adventure.  It's not one of those \\"fantasy\\" movies in some fictitious D&D kingdom with magicians, fairies, trolls and other stuff. <br /> <br />This movie takes place in modern day England and is more typical of classic monster movies like Jurassic Park, King Kong, Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, et cetera. <br /> <br />Well worth the watch.

B00003CWPL|5.0|This was the  film debut of David Lynch, the most prominent promise in what concerns to imagery and display of nightmarish implications. After the raising of John Carpenter (Dark star) and Nicholas Roeg (Performance) in the early seventies, the figure of the weird presence of Lynch augured for many viewers at that moment a career filled of innovative proposals; and the time finally has been the best judge.<br /><br />A good part of the monstrous creative talent of David Lynch resides in having translated and formulated in terms of semiotic language, peculiar dreams, devilish landscapes and claustrophobic ambiances impregnated and nourished of sardonic humor and surrealistic visions ( the sequence of the bleeding chicken, for instance).<br /><br />The essential core of the bizarre universe of David Lynch may be found in this post- apocalyptic nightmare, hovered by shocking sequences that basically work out as a huge background of this poignant love story around a weird couple who has given birth a very strange creature (that reminds us closely to the horrid Alien 1). This hateful presence of this devilish being conforms the horror in its most brutal nakedness and at the meantime allows Lynch to show us part of his never ending imagery, filled of sarcastic touches and spasmodic visions.<br /><br />Like Bunuel, Lynch simply carves in relief his obsessions, without trying to explain or solve nothing. He is a social scalpel, a febrile entomologist that exposes with crude realism the sinister symbols that conform his personal vision of the world.<br /><br />You know what implies to follow the indications of this talented and outlaw filmmaker, but it will be an absolute reward in case you do. Since its release, the film achieved a cult status all around the world.<br /><br />A must-have.
B000EZ7ZZE|5.0|This movie is an awesome example of blu-ray technology. It looked and sounded amazing. And the movie itself is great on it's own. The only drawback is that, like most blu-rays, the special features are lacking.
1406793914|5.0|This is a truly wonderful book.  I can't think of a better one for Card magic.  It explains the different sleights, and has excellent routines to use them.  It does assume one has a basic understanding of Card magic, so I suppose someone starting out who has no background could find it frustrating.  It's not the best book for a rank beginner, but for someone who has some knowledge of the basics, I think it's terrific.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|At first, I just got this cd for a couple songs to see if I liked it, the first couple times I listened to this cd, I didn't like it as much as I do now, but the more I listen to it, the more I really love the songs...I also have the rest of her cds, and they are good as well...but I really like this cd...I really like the tracks Don't Bother, Your Embrace, Something, Timor, and all the other songs are just as great...they might be in English, but that doesn't mean Shakira can't still be good! I say, if you like Shakira, give it a couple listens, you might like it over time...it was just different getting used to, which is fine with me because I like things changing...you don't want an artists songs sounding the same do you?
B000002MUQ|2.0|I wanted to like this album.  I really did.  I'm a big Van Halen fan, and a big Van Hagar fan as well.   <br /> <br />It's just too trite.  Many of the songs feel like they threw a bunch of good elements in a hat (low chorused guitar riff/harmonics/big beat/primal scream/crazy solo/resolving of tension with soaring melodic guitar) and pulled them out in combinations to create songs.  Some of these elements work for a few bars, but ultimately they all disappoint. <br /> <br />Honestly, there isn't a single song on this album that is really complete and interesting.  Sorry guys.  I tried.   <br /> <br />
1573223085|3.0|Dan Pink does well to highlight the importance of developing abilities that utilize the oft-ignored right side of the brain.  However, even though he speaks of a whole minded approach to life, his emphasis often swings clearly to the right-brained activities to the point of seemingly devaluing left brained activities.  There is a good deal of value in the information and insights he provides.  These just would have been better utilized if his approach was more balanced.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I first saw this documentary in theaters and then on TV (after I bought the DVD) soon after it won the Oscar for best documentary. It is both a wonderful experience as well as a sad reminder of how far we have let go of our planet. I am sure this will touch people in many different ways, especially those in politics bent on trying to lie about the truths that are so evident in our world today. As for me, this DVD is a great way to never forget about all the horrible things we are doing to our planet and a constant reminder to do my part, no matter how small, to stop using our planet as our own personal trash can.

B000069KE0|5.0|\\"Oh wow, man!\\" <br /> <br />Any baby-boomer who remembers the role that rock played in the social conscience of young America in the late 60's/early 70's should invest in this CD, and perhaps the Chicago recordings on either side of it as well.  Having not listened to the complete recording of Chicago II in over three decades, the emotions invoked by the vigor and poignancy of the melodies and lyrics was an immediate trip back to that era, complete with its optimism and hope for social change.  Others have undoubtedly already broken this album down far better than I could, so I'll pass on that aspect, other than to say that it was the beginning of infusing brass into rock, and in its early years, Chicago did it as well as anyone.  It was a great time for horns, with Blood, Sweat and Tears, Ides of March, Tower of Power, and more.  Most importantly, Chicago really captured the spirit of that era.  Many songs have delved into social commentary in greater depth and with more clarity, but Chicago was about capturing the essence, which IMHO makes it a more lasting message.  In dealing with the topic of social injustice, how do you top the conciseness of the lyric \\"Gotta end soon, my friend!\\"? <br /> <br />The throw-in singles tracks at the end of the CD are just that, and add little.  As much as I loved those two particular tunes from that recording, they simply lose something heard out of the context of the flow of the entire recording. <br /> <br />At the risk of being over the top, I spent an enthralled hour listening to this CD, amid a swirl of emotions not felt in decades.  It was worth every penny if I never listened to it again.  But of course I already have.  Many times...

B00005JPFB|4.0|Yesterday I was able to watch \\"Alatriste\\", at the avant premi&eacute;re of this film in Argentina. The movie started way too late, but was well-worth waiting for. Agust&iacute;n D&iacute;az Yanes clearly succeeded in his filmic version of P&eacute;rez-Reverte's \\"Alatriste\\" series, offering the spectators the opportunity to witness the adventures of a soldier and his friends, and making us care for whatever happens to them.<br /><br />The action is set in the early 17th century, mainly in Spain. The story is told in retrospective by &Iacute;&ntilde;igo Balboa (Unax Ugalde), a young man that Diego Alatriste (Viggo Mortensen) took under his wing after the death of his father, an old comrade. Alatriste was a soldier that sometimes offered his sword for hire to those who could pay the price, and that lived a dangerous life, during the decline of the Spanish Empire.<br /><br />This film lasts more or less two hours, but that is enough to learn about Diego Alatriste and I&ntilde;igo, the women they loved, and the dangerous lives they led. It is also quite interesting to watch Alatriste's Spain, and learn what was wrong with it, from the point of view of a simple soldier that nonetheless had lots of pride and a distinctive point of view regarding what was happening around him.<br /><br />Pride, courage, friendship, love and treason are some of the themes that this film tackles, while telling us about Alatriste and his friend. I would like to point out that the cast did a wonderful, specially in the case of Viggo Mortensen as Alatriste, Unax Ugalde as I&ntilde;igo, Ariadna Gil as Alatriste's lover and Elena Anaya as Ang&eacute;lica, the young woman I&ntilde;igo loved with all his heart.<br /><br />On the whole, I can say I really liked \\"Alatriste\\". It is the kind of outstanding movie that creates an atmosphere that leds you to believe someone has managed to find a way to bring the past back, and you are lucky enough the experience it. What more can you ask a movie for? Of course, highly recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS1:  Bear in mind that \\"Alatriste\\" has some scenes with a lot of violence and some nudity, never gratuitous but not adequate for children.<br /><br />PS2: I saw Viggo at the avant premi&eacute;re, and I am pretty sure that the ladies will be glad to know that he is just as good looking in person as in the movies. What is more important, though, is that he was extremely polite, and with a seemingly never ending patience for signing autographs and letting fans take photos :)urse, highly recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS1:  Bear in mind that \\"Alatriste\\" has some scenes with a lot of violence and some nudity, never gratuitous but not adequate for children.<br /><br />PS2: I saw Viggo at the avant premi&eacute;re, and I am pretty sure that the ladies will be glad to know that he is just as good looking in person as in the movies.

141694740X|5.0|We ordered this book for our 16 year old grand daughter, after hearing her talk about her \\"boyfriend\\",we know from having our own children that kids hear you when you talk but don't always listen, so rather than try and talk to her we felt it was better for her to discover on her own....like it was HER idea.  The \\"boyfriend\\" is no longer in her world and hopefully she has a  learning experience to build on....she is just starting to date and we wanted to give her any tools we could to help her make wise choices.  This book is just one way we could hopefully help her discover in this very fun and exciting time of her life.
0743298020|5.0|It is still hard for me to comprehend how this tremendously impressive book could be Diane Setterfield's debut novel. She displays such masterful storytelling abilities, I assumed that she was an old pro. But my misapprehension is all for the better; now I can look forward to Setterfield amazing me again with further displays of her prowess.<br /><br />Let me point out one thing about this book that may have been missed in the rush to praise it. JANE EYRE, WUTHERING HEIGHTS, and the other classics of Gothic literature are wonderfully appealing books. They are also essentially quite silly. That is why so few writers attempt to write stories in that style now; it's too difficult to pull the Gothic rabbit out of the hat without contemporary readers rolling their eyes.<br /><br />Setterfield's accomplishment here is to write a thoroughly convincing, modern-day Gothic novel without making it a mere homage or a snide pastiche. Of course, there are many allusions to the genre (both subtle and overt) in THE THIRTEENTH TALE, but the book is very much able to deliver the goods on its own terms.<br /><br />Also recommended: Jennifer Egan's excellent novel, [[ASIN:1400043921 The Keep]]
B0007MVXQG|2.0|Dual disc's suk. I can;t play this CD in my car. 2005 Volvo nor does it work in my wifes 2006 Toyota. WTF! I'll buy it again if it's in a single disk format.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|If you've avoided this disc as I did because the idea seemed wrong, fear not. This is an exquisite experience. What convinced me was a friend sending me the combined Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows cut, which caused my jaw to drop to the floor. The hair stood up on the back of my neck. Simply astonishing. Words fail. <br /> <br />So I bought the CD/DVD set and have been swimming through it for the past week, totally delighted. <br /> <br />The key is to simply accept it as a dreamscape, and go with it instead of trying to critique it at every turn. Just drift. Just let it wash over you. <br /> <br />Quite seriously this is how the Beatles catalog would sound if the listener were on LSD. A few of you reading this will understand what I mean. It's high praise. <br /> <br />I'm turning 55 soon and it struck me today that I've been listening to the Beatles since I was 12 years old. Through the magic that I doubt any of us truly understands, no person, faith or fact has ever meant more to me or stayed in my heart so fully as have the Beatles. I know, it even sounds crazy to me... but it's true and I'm eternally greatful. <br /> <br />A surprisingly moving album, I think the serious fan may find it deeply emotional, if only upon the encapsulated realization of the immensity of this music and its influence on our lives. <br /> <br />George and Giles - you did a wonderful job. Thank you.
0066620996|5.0|This is one of the best books about leadership I've ever read.  Even though Collins discusses corporate America in his studies, as a military officer and company commander I found that G2G directly translates to leadership at company and battalion levels.  I made this a must read for all of my junior officers, and I would recommend this book to anyone, regardless of their profession.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|The definition of Babble is to utter in an incoherent, foolish, or meaningless fashion. Which this movie does for more then 2 1/2 hours. It's supposed to be 3 stories woven togther, but comes off as 1 story with 2 other \\"stories\\" paperclipped to it. I really was floored after I endured this movie, to find that some of the acters were actually nominated for Oscars. WTF? Like I have heard in the past, I only gave this one star because I had too.

B00004U420|2.0|Forty years ago Hogan's Heroes worked because it was pure farce and its German POW camp was acceptable as a setting for a comedy, while Life Is Beautiful failed in large part because a German concentration camp is not a place to set humor. I was told this was a charming movie with a lot of joy within it. \\"Joy despite the misery,\\" is what someone said. I found it ridiculous, boring, and an insult to the memory of those who were murdered by the Third Reich. Roberto Benigni wasn't funny, just manically irritating. The actor needs either animal tranquilizers or a punch in the mouth, I'm not sure which. Maybe both. Life Is Beautiful was a horrible film that shocked me with its idiocy, far-fetched plot turns, and overall annoying awfulness start to finish. How filmgoers ever fell for this incredibly unfunny waste of time baffles me.
B000MV8AE0|3.0|I'm not as overwhelmed as the last reviewer.  The movie is visually very pleasing, and of course the music is wonderful, but the characters and their situations are terribly cliche'd, and the script pretty clunky and wooden in places.  Basically, this is just an old-time Hollywood biopic with a touch of social comment (the role of women) and discussion of the nature of Art thrown in.  Diane Kruger is curiously lukewarm and not entirely convincing, but Ed Harris does a good job, and despite my reservations this is certainly a movie worth watching.

6305558167|5.0|A quarter of a century later and this is still the best retelling of the Arthurian legend I've ever seen...and my all-time favorite flick! Oh, I'm aware of it's flaws: Nigel Terry's acting is somewhat \\"stagey\\" and the grail quest portion of the flim drags a bit.  As a previous reviewer stated, it helps to be familiar with the legend before watching the movie.  Minor points, however.  John Boorman has truly created a masterpiece, a film of incredible dark beauty and power.  I've probably watched Excalibur 50 times over the past 26 years, and the ending still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.  Great stuff!

B000F6YPY6|5.0|After the unfortunate departure of John Cale, the Velvet Underground had a musical revamp -- their third album, \\"The Velvet Underground\\" is smoother and less gritty. Stripped of the shock value, the best of the Velvet Underground shines through -- great musical skills and beautiful songwriting.<br /><br />That change is evident from the very start, \\"Candy Says,\\" which is sort of the musical musings of transsexual Candy Darling. Rather than playing this for shock value, the way the Velvets did earlier -- see songs like \\"Heroin\\" and \\"Venus in Furs\\" -- it's soft, sweet and a bit poignant, ending with \\"Maybe when I'm older/What do you think I'd see/If I could walk away from me.\\"<br /><br />That mellower tone sets the stage for the rest of the album, which relies on poetic lyrics and strong music -- they no longer sing about S&M and drugs, but about self-examination and redemtpion. The Velvets' rock sound is less jagged and more laid-back, and they even take a foray into twangy country music in \\"Some Kinda Love.\\"<br /><br />A few songs hint at the earlier work that the Velvets did, with tambourines and blurred, high vocals from Lou Reed. But can you imagine the Velvet Underground, in their first album, ever singing a non-satirical song about Jesus Christ, as they do in one haunting ballad on here? I certainly can't, and it seems to be a part of the pensive, self-examining mood that permeates this album.<br /><br />The one exception is \\"The Murder Mystery.\\" It's literally impossible to understand the \\"right voice\\" and \\"left voice\\" speaking in this song. It's interesting, but completely unintelligible. However, this is amply made up for in the mature instrumentation and lyrics; while Doug Yule was not as great as John Cale, he does a good job with the organ. The fuzzy edge of Velvet Underground rock is retained, while they branched out into ethereal ballads and pretty acoustic songs.<br /><br />Reed's lyrics betray a greater maturity, and maybe greater poignancy. \\"One minute born, one minute doomed,/One minute up, one minute down/What goes on in your mind?\\" he ponders at the start of the album. He sings some of the songs, sounding surprisingly melodic, since his voice was kind of creaky; on the other hand, Moe Tucker provides some fair vocals for songs like \\"After Hours.\\"<br /><br />The Velvet Underground hit another peak in their self-titled album. Softer, more thoughtful, this shows them off at their best, and is definitely worth checking out.ancy. \\"One minute born, one minute doomed,/One minute up, one minute down/What goes on in your mind?\\" he ponders at the start of the album.

B000F6YPXM|5.0|Heroin, sadomasochism, paranoia, hangovers, seductive ladies and a big banana on the cover. The Velvet Underground was unique in 1967 -- even if it never made big sales -- and remains unique to this day, no matter how many bands are influenced by them. (Not bad for an arty band!)<br /><br />Lou Reed tears through a variety of songs, ranging from gritty hard rock to strange ballads. The most memorable song here is undoubtedly slashing, exotic S/M ode \\"Venus in Furs\\" (\\"Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him/Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart\\"). Elsewhere, he dips into pure rock in the desperate \\"Run, Run, Run,\\" but takes a softer turn with surreal junkie ballads and the eerie, soft \\"Sunday Morning.\\"<br /><br />However, German ex-model Nico -- who departed the band in hazy circumstances after this album -- leads with her seductive monotone. She only had a handful of songs, but they remain some of the best: singsong \\"Femme Fatale,\\" steady and slow \\"All Tomorrow's Parties,\\" and the exquisite ballad \\"I'll Be Your Mirror.\\"<br /><br />The Velvet Underground was probably the first real art band in rock history, formed at a time when megabands like the Rolling Stones were at their peak. But they couldn't have been more different from the heavily-publicized bands -- creepy, dark, and both beautiful and ugly. The Velvet Underground was the reverse of mainstream.<br /><br />The music isn't complex, but it is strangely compelling -- the wiggling guitar at the beginning of \\"Black Angel's Death Song,\\" or the tambourines Nico played in her songs. Nowhere else could musical compositions like \\"Sunday Morning\\" -- the delicate tune reminiscent of a music box -- seem so haunting as they do here.<br /><br />The vocals are excellent, although listeners will probably like one or the other. Lou Reed's high thin voice is a sharp contrast to Nico's accented, husky croon. (Nico left the band after this album, which is a shame), but it's the writing that makes it stand out The songwriting is outstanding, and since the frank references to kinky sex and drugs are nowhere near as shocking now as they were then, the raw quality of the songs can shine.<br /><br />The sparse, slithering music and excellent singing add solidarity to the reputation of the Velvet Underground as a classic. Dark and brooding, debut album \\"Velvet Underground and Nico\\" is an exceptional album.tand out The songwriting is outstanding, and since the frank references to kinky sex and drugs are nowhere near as shocking now as they were then, the raw quality of the songs can shine.  <br /> <br />The sparse, slithering music and excellent singing add solidarity to the reputation of the Velvet Underground as a classic.

B000F6YPXW|4.0|Distortion. Either you love it or you hate it, and that will determine whether you love or hate the Velvet Underground's \\"White Light/White Heat,\\" which was the final album with John Cale on it. It's strange, raw and eerie, and except for the too-long finale, a fairly good collection.<br /><br />It kicks off with distorted pop song \\"White Light/White Heat,\\" and gets followed by equally distorted series of offbeat songs, such as the sex-change operation ballad \\"Lady Godiva's Operation,\\" the relatively ethereal \\"Here She Comes Now,\\" and the twisted, squealing riffs of \\"I Heard Her Call My Name.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Gift\\" is perhaps the most offbeat of all the tracks here: A spoken story-song, recited matter-of-factly in John Cale's Welsh accent. It's about a jealous husband who, in doubt about his wife's fidelity, mails himself to her house. Sounds ordinary enough, except that there is a twist to the finale, both funny and macabre.<br /><br />This is one of the darker albums that the Velvet Underground did, as well as the last one that was so experimental. The finale is almost twenty minutes of screeching, explosive guitar riffs, and the story-song is definitely odd. But once you get into the swing of it, it's remarkably moving.<br /><br />The fuzz and wildness of \\"White Light/White Heat\\" is definitely offputting at first -- the melodies are buried under a perpetual buzz of sound. That lo-fi flavor won't be to everyone's taste, but those who like their music rough, raw and ragged will probably like the murky riffs and muffled drumming, rising out of a thick mass of fuzz.<br /><br />For those who don'ty like distortion, it might be a comfort to just focus on the offbeat lyrics -- they can be vulgar, nasty, enchanting, or they can be brimful of black comedy. At least, they are never boring. In his VU swansong, Cale gets to recite and sing, and his rich vocals prove to be somewhat more compelling than Lou Reed's.<br /><br />While perhaps the weakest, rawest and least accessible of the Velvet Underground's albums, \\"White Light/White Heat\\" has the distinction of Cale's vocals and some wickedly weird writing.and least accessible of the Velvet Underground's albums, \\"White Light/White Heat\\" has the distinction of Cale's vocals and some wickedly weird writing.

B000N3SS80|5.0|I am confused when people come on Amazon.com to write a review, I would assume that they they would be reviewing the book, album, or product rather than making personal attacks or personal praises....but that doesn't seem like the case when it comes to Jennifer Lopez, let alone this beautiful album. <br /> <br />I had the album a month before it's official release and officially bought my copy yesterday. This is the best album of her career thus far in terms of vocals and lyrics. She's been a good pop artist up until this point. With Como Ama una Mujer, Miss Lopez has made the transformation from pop fluff diva to mature musical artist -- and what better way to do it than through a Spanish album, which she's always wanted to do. She's always made it clear to her record label upon first album that Spanish music was her intent but they made it clear that she should first make an English album, followed by four other English albums. Upon hearing her Spanish demos, I can say she sounded fine but upon comparing with this album, she sounds way better. I am glad it took Lopez enough experiences about love in order for her to use her own money to finance the album herself. (PS - Her execs heard the album and decided to help market her 2 yr passion project). <br /> <br />Here is a track by track review of the album: <br /> <br />Qué Hiciste - Excellent first single delivering strong vocals and intense lyrics over a Latin flavored rock tinged production. This is one of the album's overall highlights. This is a great song for her to perform to. <br /> <br />Me Haces Falta - Beautiful opening, great chorus and overall contributes to the album's strong opening. The 2nd highlight of the album. <br /> <br />Como Ama Una Mujer - Great ballad. What makes this song work well is Lopez's voice. I have never heard her sound so raw, crisp and go so high in octave than ever before. This is one of the song's that puts the rumour to rest of her not being able to sing. There are no background singers, just Lopez's voice, great lyrics, and soft yet dramatic production to showcase the heart of the album's meaning -- how a woman loves -- the main  theme of the album makes it clear with a beautiful ballad like this. <br /> <br />Te Voy A Querer - This is a hot song! Because of the instruments and her voice, it sounds like it would be a great song for a live performance. I could see this being a huge summer hit if they were to release it and market it either this year or next year spring/summer. Another album highlight. <br /> <br />Por Que Te Marchas - One of the worthy leftovers from \\"Rebirth\\" but created with Spanish lyrics. I like the Spanish version more than the English version. With lush production, passion, and sadness, it's great to  hear Jennifer sing something everyone can relate to.  <br /> <br />Por Arriesgarnos - Besides No Me Ames, this is the BEST duet Marc and Jennifer have ever done. Marc only sings with her on the chorus but EVERYTHING from the opening to the closing of this midtempo love song could get no better. It's so beautiful and upon first listen, it touched me deep in my heart that I feel as though I have to hear this song played at my wedding (and I'm only 21, I don't intend on getting married until almost 30). <br /> <br />Tu- My favorite track on the whole album. It sounds like a feel of 80s Italian pop as someone else mentioned. I LOVE THIS SONG. It's one of the best ballads I've heard since the 90s from any artist. Lopez sounds AMAZING vocally, the production is PERFECT, and the lyrics are truly beautiful without being cheesy. One of the best highlights of the album. The opening is soft before exploding into the lush chorus with extended vocals by Lopez herself. She continues the theme of having no backup singers, with the exception to the fast paced songs like the first 2 and the midtempo ballad she does with M.Anthony. <br /> <br />Amarte Es Todo - Another of my favorite songs. It's beautiful without being cheesy and hereis where Lopez delivers her most powerful and intense high octave range vocals compared to any of the other ballads. All of them sound great, but with a title translated as \\"love is everything,\\" it's worthy to make clear that her vocals truly shine her. I hear she's going to be on American Idol next month. This would be the song for her to perform on a show like that.  <br /> <br />Apresurate - I like this song a lot, especially when I first got the album. It has great lyrics and makes you feel good.  <br /> <br />Sola - This song has an interesting feel to it - reminds me of an ambient electro midtempo ballad.  <br /> <br />Adios - Excellent way to close such a beautiful album. It sounds live with the audience joining in to sing and applauses being given to Lopez.  <br /> <br />There are no filler tracks on this album. 11 beautiful song ranging from tough latin rock to soft passionate ballads reflecting on the title of How a Woman Loves. Lopez has never sounded so good. As passionate as she seems about this album and from all the buzz and interviews, it has lived up to its expectations in comparison to any musical work she has ever created. This album is worth 5 stars.  <br /> <br />I find it tacky when the reviews attack her past personal life or discuss anything unrelated to 'Como Ama una Mujer. REVIEW THE ALBUM FROM AN HONEST LISTEN RATHER THAN POSTING THESE SAME LAME COMMENTS ABOUT HOW IT SUCKS. <br /> <br />For the record, her Spanish is FINE on this album. I can't say the same for her live interviews; she still manages to stumble here and there, but there have been noticeable improvements. I haven't bought an album in months, and purchasing this album was a satisfied purchase because again, I loved every track.  <br /> <br />If she were to have added 3 or 4 more uptempo tracks, then this would be a well rounded contempoary spanish album but instead she does fine relating to her overall theme of spanish ballads to showcase how a woman loves -- no one better todo it then Lopez herself, who is well known for her past public love interests/ relationships.  <br /> <br />Overall, the album is perfect with minimal flaws. Lopez has matured in her musical artistianship on many levels. Her lyrical and vocal maturity gives strong hope as to which direction she will take her future musical projects both in Spanish (and English) and how she has the potential to be  one of music's greatest pop bilingual icons if she continues on this road of evolving musical personal and professional development.  <br /> <br />When deciding to buy this album, you should buy it because it's great contempoary spanish music NOT because she is Puerto Rican or not buy it because of any stupid biases you've had in the past in regards to Lopez.  Even for those that do not speak Spanish; the beauty of this album is evident. Love is a universal theme in all languages.
B000LE0THO|5.0|If you love ELO you must own this CD, the packaging in a hardbound book form with the small put together ELO Mobile is awesome for any collector. I really enjoyed the quality of these recordings especially since I still own the Original 1977 double LP, it was also great to get a few bonus tracks not previously availible.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I have been a huge fan of FM and Stevie for years and I am very glad she came out with a compilation like this. I know a lot of us Stevie fans have most of this music (which is a common complaint among reviewers) but I think that the addition of the live tracks as well as ones that were previously included on Timespace are worth it. And if you buy the CD/DVD package, then the DVD is worth the price alone. <br />Having said that, the music is great, the live tracks are excellent. But the real treasure here is the DVD. If she had just included her videos that would have been more than enough but she goes a step further for her fans and includes a look at footage taped during the recording of her Belladonna album AND commentaries by Stevie on every video! I watched all the videos and commentaries and Stevie is a riot. She can laugh at herself, some of her lyrics, her hair, and even the sometimes non-sensical ways 80's music videos are made. I found myself chuckling through the whole commentary! <br />This is an excellent buy and if you are having trouble finding it at your local music store (much like I did) definitely buy it here. You won't be disappointed!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Being a huge Bond fan, I was a little taken back by how brash and un-Bond-like this was, I guess he's growing into the Bond I know and Love.
B000002O1Q|4.0|Dark, moody film, lots of physical action, and most definately the  music. Kind of music if you like Meatloaf - strong, bold, out there operetic rock. Best part of the movie is watching Diane Lane lip sync strong vocals, dance and just look sexy. <br />This movie was given a positive feature write up in \\"Time\\" magazine when it was reviewed and unfortunately did poorly at the box office. Don't know why as the movie actually has a story line, a great bad guy, a beautiful girl, a strong leading man, and some great music tracks.
B000N3SRRC|4.0|My Lord, I haven't even taken Robot Hive/Exodus off of heavy rotation, and the mighty Clutch drops another payload on me!  What can you say about these guys?  You feel a little odd critiquing a band that is clearly so much better than you.  Clutch is genius.  Clutch is sublime.  Clutch is a heavy metal hedonist's wet dream.  They are pure rock fury, and if you resist, you're only wasting your time.  Clutch will prevail, my friend, they will prevail.  You can't stop the progress. <br />
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I loved this movie for a couple of reasons.   <br /> <br />1) The director incorporated the song \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" into the sound track. <br /> <br />2)  Shortly after the King Crimson song.  Theo and his cousin are standing in front of some large plate glass windows.  Outside the windows, the background looks exactly the same as the cover of Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\" album.  I think I'm one of the few who caught that. <br /> <br />Can't wait for more from Alfonso Cuaron.
0321344758|5.0|I'm looking forward to the new edition in 2014. This book lays out the needs and expectations of site users and shows you how to design a site's content and navigation in a way that meets both.
1416914285|3.0|I found the book to be good.  It wasn't horrible as some reviews have stated.  Yes the continuity was off in parts of the book but lots of books have those kinds of issue. I blame the editing more then the writing. I thought the plot was well thought out, but not necessarily carried out as well as it could have been. The characters descriptions were a little thin.  I could have used a little more character description.  I found the book readable and it had plenty of good moments.  There were also boring and/or predictable moments, but more fun moments then predictable moments.  <br /> <br />Yes the book could have been darker but it was fine for a Young Adult book.   <br /> <br />I have not read her fan fiction so I might have a different reaction to the book then those who have read her fan fiction <br /> <br />Yes I have read better but it was a good read and I enjoyed it just fine.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Listening to the Celtic woman makes you happy and can also bring tears to your eyes.  Since receiving the DVD I have played part or all of it every day.
1932100660|5.0|This book has the ability to change lives.  I believe we will hear more about diet and cancer in the days to come.  My husband and I are now eating plant enriched diets and feel good about taking positive steps for our health in the future.  I doubt even the best science will convince America to change their eating habits, but for those of us who want a positive change there is sound advice in this book.  A definite read for the health concious.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is a great play and you should go see it. Having the soundtrack enables you to enjoy the fun stuff all over again. Lots of fun.
0393061434|4.0|An enjoyable look into the mind of a true computer genius. Whether you're interested in the early history of personal computing or just how really creative people think and work, this book won't disappoint you.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I disagree with the reviewers who feel there weren't enough \\"riches\\" in this story. I think focusing on the endless hardships he faced made his story that much more believabe.  When you thought he couldn't make it, more bad things happened, and he came through it with his strength and courage still intact.  The story does a fantastic job of letting you personally feel his desperation, sadness, frustration, but above all, his DETERMINATION.  This guy put everything he had into a program that could have very easily not given him a future.  Also, at the end, when you saw the \\"riches\\",  I felt such joy, relief, and true HAPPINESS for him.  I felt like a parent watching their child struggle for years on something, and then finally achieving their goal.  I was so encouraged by his strength.  So, I think the \\"riches\\" were in the whole movie...his courage and determination, and his son (who was absolutely adorable) were his riches that pulled him through the hard times. <br />What a great movie!
B000BCE918|5.0|Great service!!  The DVD pack arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The alien series is the classic films.And this 9-discs DVD boxset is great.Two version of films in one disc and each film has the individual feature.The ninth disc is the bonus.I'm very satisfied with this DVD. <br /> <br />The picture of Alien 1 dvd version is near perfect,and the DTS surround is good. <br />The aliens dvd is not refixed which compare with the direct edition.But the quality is acceptable. <br />The alien 3 has the  different version with the old version  and alien 4 has the different end. I just enjoy all content of this DVD . <br /> <br />
0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult is the story of thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald who sues her parents for the rights to her own body. Anna was conceived for the sole purpose of being a donor for Kate, her cancer-stricken sister, but after so many years of being pressured into medical procedures, she finally decides that she's had enough...despite the deadly consequences for Kate. <br />  <br />As with any book that explores a complex ethical issue, it is important to scrutinize every point of view. Therefore, to make sure each perspective is adequately examined, Picoult has numerous characters narrating the story, including Anna, her frazzled mother, her sympathetic father, her rebellious brother, and even her lawyer. Picoult's writing is so suspenseful that I often had trouble putting the book down, and not just because I wanted to reach the result of the trial. Even many of the subplots are incredibly engaging, and I wanted to know what happens if and when the firefighting father realizes that his own son is the pyromaniac he's been chasing, and what is the well-kept secret behind the service dog that the lawyer, Campbell Alexander, takes everywhere? Additionally, through the use of an extensive flashback, we learn all about the family's tragic history from the moment Kate is diagnosed. The already powerful emotions of the story are only enhanced by Picoult's wonderful writing style and her skillful use of imagery. In fact, my only complaint is about the \\"love story\\" involving Campbell Alexander and Julia Romano. I don't know why Picoult felt the need to include all the clichés and \\"coincidences\\" that only romance novel enthusiasts can ever take seriously, and I was disappointed that such a talented writer had to resort to such a formulaic subplot. However, because it was only a subplot, I can overlook it in my overall love of this book. <br />  <br />In My Sister's Keeper, Picoult succeeds in taking a complicated issue and exploring all aspects of it throughthe use of a suspenseful plot and multi-dimensional characters. I would recommend this book to anyone because, annoying romance novel stereotypes aside, it's the kind of story that, with the help of Picoult's accomplished writing skills, anyone can, and will, get drawn into.
B0002VL0KQ|3.0|The CD is OK.  It's Celine so you know the singing is stellar.  But in terms of variety (different tempo and melodies, etc) all the songs tend to sound the same so there is never a \\"climax\\" in the arrangement. <br />A better lullaby CD is \\"A Mother's Gift\\" from Carnie Wilson.
B000NA28I4|2.0|Let me start by saying if you have read the book don't try watching the movie. There is absolutely no comparison. To make this portion short: events were changed and mashed together, and there were to minor characters left out who play bigger roles in book two. And Murtaugh had all of 10 minutes of screen time. With that said... <br /> <br />The movie was rather slow paced with no emphasis placed where it should have been. Jeremy Irons character, Brom, seemed to carry the story along instead of the main characters, Eragon and Saphira. In the movie, I felt like events were put into motion without a reason behind them. (In the book everything was thoroughly explained, however I should not compare.) The movie lacked substance and motivation. <br /> <br />The best things I can say about the movie are the excellent cinematography and CG (plenty of it). Also the acting was great considering what needed to be pulled off. Saphira, the dragon, is only able to communicate by speech through thought. The actor really brought Saphira to life with words and voice only. Amazing!!! Also the actor playing Eragon used his thoughts to communicate with Saphira. The facial expressions he used during these parts were very well done.  <br /> <br />For anyone who has not read the book but has watched this movie and was not \\"wowed\\" (like many of my friends) take the time to read it. As I have already said there is no comparison. I know there are reviews out there comparing Christopher Paolini to Tolkien. Based on the book I agree. If only they could have done for Eragon as they did for Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br />Bottom line: The movie was lost in translation.  <br />
1932100660|5.0|this book presents a commprehensive .view of diet and healththat i affirm based on my own experience and research . I have tried the recomendations and they work.
0446530573|5.0|Every recipe in this book is excellent.  Brings me back to my grandmothers kitchen in Ozone Park.  The only thing missing is the wine in the jelly glasses. There needs to be a part II to this book
0143038419|4.0|I found this book to be thought provoking, especially on how messed up people get in the search for meaning or purpose.  In this case, the author searches for fulfillment in sexual relationships and as a result the fulfillment is temporary.  Through the course of the book the author greaves the loss of love and slowly recovers by spending time examining herself (and spiritual dimensions) but at the end falls back into the love seeking cycle.  It is an interesting book and is filled with vibrant imagery.
B000AAP7BM|5.0|at first I was little sckeptical about Luis Miguel's voice for mariachi, been always a fan of his romances and ballad or bolero recordings, when I heard Mexico en la piel I was blown away by his voice with mariachi, I can definettly now say he could sing in any style, and do it well.
0143034901|5.0|Have you ever read a book you fell in love with and wanted to read everything this author has written? What if all copies of that author's works were mysteriously destroyed? Would you give up or would you press on to find out why?<br /><br />On Daniel's 10th birthday, his father takes him to the cemetery of lost books and lets him choose a book - It is a work by Julian Carax. Daniel becomes fascinated by the book and finds there are no more copies of the author's work. He begins a quest to find out why, and begins years of unraveling this mystery. Carax and Daniel's lives seem to have parallel lives.<br /><br />Wind is beautifully written and the translation is expertly done. For those who love the beauty of the word, a mystery, a love story, a horror story, redemption, etc. this is a book for you.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|I've been a fan of Ms Badu since day one and I'd always wanted to get this CD. I just never seemed to get around to it. But then I saw her perform \\"Back In The Day (Puff)\\" on stage on [[ASIN:B000FMH8RG Dave Chappelle's Block Party (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]] and I knew the time had come.<br /><br />It's a brilliant set with Erykah doing what she does best, presiding over the neo-soul and hip-hop beats like some kind of musical & spiritual high priestess. The first couple of tunes (including the wonderful \\"Intro - World Keeps Turnin'\\"); \\"Bump It\\", \\"Back In The Day (Puff)\\", \\"I Want You\\", \\"Woo\\", \\"The Grind\\" and \\"Danger\\" are simply flawless, in my opinion.<br /><br />Things get rather ropey towards the end though, and her version of \\"Think Twice\\" is not even half as good as the Donald Byrd original. I've always believed that if you're going to do a cover, you need to bring something new (if not better) to the party or there's really no point bothering. And \\"Love Of My Life Worldwide\\" with Angie Stone and Queen Latifah is just awful.<br /><br />Still, she ends on a positive note. \\"Outro - World Keeps Turnin'\\" is just a reprise of the intro but it's so good it's worth hearing twice. Besides, it does sound like the latter part of the album was recorded live in front of an audience - but I could be wrong - in which case, aforementioned ropiness is well and truly forgiven.<br /><br />Cool CD, all in all. I like it. I read somewhere that this is supposed to be an EP and not a full album. It sounds like a full album to me and a pretty decent one at that.<br /><br />She's due a new one anytime soon, surely?
B000MV9026|4.0|In the tradition of Finding Nemo, Happy Feet is the story of the kid who just isn't like the others. Mumble is the son of two emperor penguins that both have beautiful singing voices. The emperor penguin uses song to find a mate, so it's important that they learn from an early age to sing from their heart so that they can find their one true love. Unfortunately for Mumble, he can't sing. Not just can't sing well, but can't sing at all, to the point where the penguins' vocal coach--who has never turned down a case--throws up her hands in defeat when he tries. Instead, Mumble has another talent. He likes to dance. His \\"happy feet\\" make him stick out like a sore thumb and cause him to be an outcast in the penguin community. Like Mumble's father says, dancing \\"just ain't penguin.\\" Happy Feet is the story of Mumble's struggle to find a way to fit in with the rest of the crowd.<br /><br />Having just watched March of the Penguins, Happy Feet was such a welcome change from the sad tale of how harsh life is for these animals. The entire time I watched MotP, I kept wondering what in the world sustains these male penguins as they stand in the freezing cold protecting these eggs. In Happy Feet, the answer is song. The male penguins huddle together for warmth, singing their heart song, and wait for their mates to return. It's romantic and endearing at the same time. I think anyone who liked March of the Penguins will enjoy Happy Feet. I would also recommend that the people who enjoy this movie see MotP.
1932100385|5.0|I come from a large family with many members who struggle with obesity.  Recently, several members of my family have been diagnosed with cancer and Type II diabetes, and less than a year ago one of my uncles died from a heart attack at a young age.  Campbell's book effectively demonstrates that we do not have to succumb to these kinds of outcomes.  He shows in a clear, scientifically grounded way that we have been bombarded with deadly information about nutrition our entire lives.  I used to think that veganism was an extreme, unhealthy diet until Campbell set me straight, and he did so without proselytizing; he simply provides the scientific information and lets the reader decide.  I have not been able to completely cut out all animal protein from my diet yet (who knew it was so difficult to cut out cheese?) but I feel empowered by Campbell's book.  I feel much more in control of my health, and I now know that I can protect myself from the painful diseases by which our modern society has been plagued.  Everyone needs to read this book.  Even if you choose to continue an unhealthy American diet, at least you will have been given the alternatives so you can make an informed choice.  I am a firm believer in choices, and Campbell's book provides choices in preventing disease rather than accepting disease as an inevitable part of getting older.  I am always skeptical of diet books because they are often gimmicky and devoid of convincing research, but even the most skeptical reader can see that Campbell's book is incredibly well-researched and informative rather than preachy.  It is not a fad diet book; it is a book about changing your lifestyle for the better.  (As a side note, cutting out animal protein has completely cleared my problematic skin.  I don't know if this would happen for everyone, but I would recommend this book for people who struggle with acne. At the very least, changing your diet will make you feel better all around, so if there is a possibility to clear up your skin too, it is worth a try.)
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I just got this CD today.  I'm listening to it as we speak.  This is just not another \\"Best of\\" CD.  Stevie really selected the perfect songs and/or remixes of her best songs.<br /><br />I love the Deep Dish mix of \\"Dreams\\".  My co-workers are probably going to kill me before the end of the day with that one.<br /><br />The live track of \\"Rhiannon\\" is fantastic.  One of Stevie's best performances of this classic.<br /><br />I've waited a LONG time to hear the live \\"Landslide\\" & \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" w/ the Melbourne Symphony other than a choppy clip off You Tube. The strings on \\"Edge\\" are fantastic.  I think thats my favorite cut on the CD. I'd like to see that whole Melbourne concert on DVD.<br /><br />Speaking of DVD's, I haven't watched the DVD yet ...... I AM working ya know!
1932100385|5.0|Extraordinary synthesis of the research done in the last 20 years on the causes of different health and illness trends.  After reading this book you  start to question the information being provided for making health decisions and the motivations of those who have been giving it.
0375408266|4.0|(This review is based on the German original, \\"Der Vorleser\\"). <br />One thing is amazing when it comes to this book.  The German paperback edition lists some 350 customer reviews, an American one, on the other hand, has more than twice as many (20% of what the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" collected).  Many of them are short and somehow superficial, being concerned mainly with the perhaps tingling relationship between an older woman (a former guard in a concentration camp to boot) and a young man and appear never to have fathomed the deeper, hidden layers of the story. <br /> <br />Schlink does not make life easy for his readers, perhaps because in his everyday life he is a lawyer qualified to plead before the German Constitutional Court and is thus accustomed to getting his point across in a complicated way; his narrative is far from straightforward and the questions he asks are often obscure.  He is very much concerned with the evolution of his characters over their lifetimes, but at a more fundamental level of this book he wants to plumb what they know, believe they know or can possibly know about the world around them. <br /> <br />To make his argument more extreme, he centers his story on an illiterate woman who, early on, realizes that she has only a restricted, personal view of the world, but still has to act out her life in accordance with the situations she finds herself in and which are far from being entirely of her own choosing.  Her decisions are not always morally acceptable to outsiders or to judgments ex-post, but in this predicament she is very much like everyone of us.   <br /> <br />What we know about the world at any moment is fragmentary, tainted, partisan and often, in hindsight, turns out to have been deliberately distorted.  Depending on our personal intelligence, on the trust we place in certain people, and on our individual upbringing we choose the direction in which to stumble along, knowing that we advance in a fog  and will never really know where weare nor where we are heading. <br /> <br />We try to find guideposts along the way and attempt to distinguish Good from Evil, but as Sartre tells us in his play \\"The Devil and the Good Lord\\", even those landmarks are unreliable in the long run.  Schlink's tale aptly illustrates this.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|Fantastic remastering, superb picture, unbelievable sound, probably about as good as it gets, and for such an old title to have been reproduced with clarity that almost defies belief, I can strongly recommend this title to anyone who has doubts about the reproduction. Just make sure that you have a high definition panel and only the very best in HDMI gold plated leads to get the best out of any Blu-ray title.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book. This is the first time I read anything by Elizabeth Gilbert and I didn't want the book to end. She is intelligient, witty, hits the nail on the head about so many circumstances in life.  Her style of writing kept me hanging on every word. I don't say this often, but I will definitely go back and re-read this book. Also, it took me on a soul searching journey along with her and if I couldn't actually travel, then this was the next best thing. A truly great read and one that I am recommending to all my female friends.
