B0001ENYKS|5.0|Sometimes, buying hyped albums without previous listenings pays off very handsomely. Glasgow's darlings Franz Ferdinand have created an album that I am enjoying to no end: upon walking into my favorite CD store, I saw the album looking me in the eye and I immediately bought it, and listened to it twice through. I hadn't heard any of the songs before, and I was most pleased with the effort and the money spent.<BR>Strokes? Interpol? Pulp? No no, FF does not sound like any of these bands. It could be argued that FF borrows small amounts of each band's musical style and creates its own amazing sound. The lyrics especially are reminiscent of 80s darlings the Smiths, particularily on the homo-erotic disco jumper \\"Michael\\".<BR>I won't jump the gun and declare Franz Ferdinand the new \\"saviors of rock n' roll\\", but their debut is everything a debut album should be: confident, swaggering, and breaking down the door of stardom instead of a small knock. This album is 39 minutes of sheer musical joy with not a minute wasted, and I will make it my personal mission to turn everyone I know onto Franz Ferdinand before Rolling Stone gets their turn later in the summer. \\"You just heard about Franz Ferdinand? I've had their album since March, where've you been, bandwagon-hopper?\\" Then I'll take off and DANCE! Seriously, buy this album today and beat the crowd.<br />\\"Beautiful boys on a beautiful dance-floor/Michael you dance like a beautiful dance-whore\\"
6304806434|5.0|When I first sat down to watch this film I was expecting anything, but when it was over I knew it was one i'd always want to Have! The Story is about a man who has done time in prison for murdering somebody who tried to hurt his wife! And Finally he's going to go home! Tho on his way home he is put onto a plane that seems to have Americas worst criminals in hostory abourd, and the plane is highjacked by them and the plot starts! to take place and unfold, and many storys are told through the way, with some comedy, some action and some fun along with some decent acting for a film of this type!<br />This movie is worth it in my opinion! But its not to everyones taste, my recomendation is to hire it before you buy it if you can! It does play on personal opinions and tastes! To me its a great movie, but you be the judge for yourself!
B0000CABBW|5.0|Based on a book by Witi Ihimaera, the story is set in a small Maori community on the coast of New Zealand. Leadership of the town is passed down from from eldest son to eldest son, tracing all the way back to Paikea, their ancestor who rode to shore on a whale after capsizing in his canoe. This hereditary line is broken, however, when a girl is born to Porourangi Apirana, the eldest son of the current community leader. The girl's mother and twin brother die in childbirth, leaving Pai (her father names her after their heroic ancestor) the sole heir. Her grandfather, Koro, is disappointed, and though he loves his granddaughter very much, and she him, he shuns her and refuses to train her as the next leader. But Pai knows who she is and takes it upon herself to learn the ways of her people and fulfill her destiny.<br />This is an amazing and touching story, made even better through excellent film-making. 12-year-old Pai is played by Keisha Castle-Hughes in a wonderful debut performance. One would never guess it was her first acting job. She manages to convey a great depth of emotion, and her crowning moment comes in a scene near the end, where she tearfully dedicates a speech to her beloved grandfather (Rawiri Paratene), who failed to show up for her recital of it. The whole film focuses on the conflicts between the great love the characters feel for each other, and the obligations of tradition. It is about a clash of generations and the struggle to reconcile the old world with the new. Pai's father (Cliff Curtis) is also at odds with Koro, so much so that he flees to live in Germany. And Pai's grandmother Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton) loves them all and tries her best to help then all make peace with one another.<br />The movie is fairly short, clocking in at 101 minutes, but the slow pacing of the story makes it seem longer. There isn't really any action, yet somehow the viewer remains captivated by the story. The beautiful, haunting soundtrack also adds a great atmosphere to the film. Every main actor turned in a spectacular performance. If you aren't familiar with the New Zealand accent, however, it may take a little while to understand everything the actors say. The realism of it all is heightened by the fact that the movie was filmed in a real seaside Maori village, and all the &quot;extras&quot; are drawn from the town's own population. This lends a great sense of community, particularly in the emotional scene near the end where the people gather to aid a pod of beached whales (which, despite being replicas, look amazingly authentic). This scene ultimately leads to Pai, in an important symbolic role, riding on the back of one of the whales.<br />The DVD also offers some nice extras. There is director commentary and the theatrical trailer. A great &quot;Behind the Scenes of Whale Rider&quot; featurette provides many insights into the filmmaking process, including how they selected Caste-Hughes for her role, how the whale replicas were constructed, and more. &quot;Te Waka: Building the Canoe&quot; follows the entire construction of the canoe that features as a major symbol in the film. Fittingly, the canoe was given as a gift to the people of the town in which the movie was filmed. There is also a featurette on the soundtrack, an art and photo gallery, and some deleted scenes. All in all I think this is one of the best films of 2003, and I recommend it highly. Though the main character is a 12-year-old girl, this is not a children's film, and should be enjoyable for viewers of all ages.osphere to the film.

0440237688|5.0|This book is great and everyone should read it. Although it seems a bit bizzare in the beginning, once you get into it it is hard to put down. This book is about a world where there are no wars, no sadness, no minorities. Everything is the same. Sounds perfect, right? Wrong. As you read this you will discover the world of Jonas, the boy who must receive all of the memories of the world. Memories of horrible things in the past. He must receive these from the Giver of memories and not share them with anyone. Everyone in this no-feeling world is being protected from these memories. Only the Giver and receiver can bear them. This book will really make you think. About life. About love. About sadness. About joy. About how we are lucky to have all these things.
0425098478|5.0|As I have seen among employees in different jobs that I have had, too often is the employee left to figure out his/her own job expectations.  When an employee experiences this feeling of insecurity, it is usually the trigger for many other undesired exhibited behaviors which soon follow.  Lack of motivation, lack of initiative, competing for the boss' attention, and trying to adopt someone else's talent rather than using one's own strengths to benefit the organization are a few of those behaviors seen.  Written job descriptions and performance evaluations are at times too vague in letting the employee know how to plan or work through their day-to-day operation.  With the concept of One Minute Goal Setting, a powerful tool for invoking motivation is born.  The employee feels like he/she has responsibility for a task, the task and the goal is written down and performance against the goal is frequently checked.  Success with the goal is then measurable.<BR>One Minute Praising is another concept of great benefit.  More than just providing feedback, it becomes a wonderful tool for reinforcing positive behavior or results, i.e. usually seen as quantity or quality work.  The employee feels a sense of fulfillment and importance, knowing that his/her work made an impact or made a difference.  It also allows the manager to currently share how he/she feels about the work rather than wait or most likely forget to mention it at the time of the employee's performance evaluation.  Out of the three concepts, I think this technique builds employee confidence the most.  When one feels confident, one is able to set higher standards for himself/herself.  Higher standards develop the attitude for working with excellence.<BR>Similarly, One Minute Reprimands \\"nip things in the bud.\\"  Undesired behaviors are curbed and discouraged and because of the seriousness in which the situation is handled, most employees will want to avoid getting reprimanded.  Two important and notable aspects of the reprimand is that the behavior of the employee is addressed, not the employee's worth.  The reprimand is also not based on \\"hearsay\\" but rather on what has been evidenced by the manager himself.  Therefore, using this technique, feelings of resentment are not fostered between the employee and the manager.<br />I found this book to be very inspiring.  Though I am not yet a manager, these concepts can be used at home, with family, as well as at work with my fellow employees - especially when we work together on projects.  They can be even be used with the managers who currently supervise me.  The principles are reciprocal and universal.  This is how I would want to be managed and this is the way I would like to manage.  Great book!
B00006CYAD|5.0|Okay, my fav. bands consist of Linkin Park, Blink-182, and WHO ELSE!!!  SIMPLE PLAN!!  Okay, like some of the other people said, you have to listen to samples of these songs and then buy the c.d.!  My friend got one when it first came out because she heard a song on the radio she liked.  Well, she let me listen to it and I loved it naturally!  I went out and bought it immediately!  That was like when it first came out but I just stumbled across this and decided to write the review.<br />-music geek
081292343X|4.0|Obama makes little mention of his white half -- although by his own account he was lovingly brought up by his white mother and her parents, and this might have provided further answers to the questions he raises about himself and where he belongs.  Obama, whom I admire as a political leader in Chicago, is young; the book is hard to read.  Obama seems to say that people of mixed backgrounds must choose only one of those backgrounds in which to make a spiritual home.

Mr. Makaveli (Tupac) spit his classic rhymes on this ablum. Unlike the other rappers, Makaveli is deep and has meaning in his rhymes. Makaveli has inspired many other rappers and he can be said to be the Run DMC of Gangsta rap. His lyric remain solid throughout the whole album, every song bangs, there is nothing you can skip, everything is a hit. Nas and Jay-Z have great lyrical skill, but they cannot top Tupac, as much as they try to be deep and put meaningful things in their song and remain in the mainstream (They have done successfully), no one does it better than Tupac. Production wise, nothing special, but when you have someone like Tupac rhyming on the beat, there is not really a big need for a hot beat behind.<br />RIP: Tupac (Makaveli)<br />Lyrics: A++<BR>Delivery: A++<BR>Production: A+<BR>Overall: A++
1559409002|5.0|Carnival of Souls is a movie made, apparently, almost on a whim by two men who never made another feature film and stars an actress who was only in one other minor movie. With that sort of background, the rather unique finished product is maybe not so surprising.What is very surprising is that the movie turned out as well as it did.<br />Some of the other reviews have compared it to the twilight zone, and that is maybe the closest thing. They are from the same time period and have overlapping themes. The plotting for Carnival, though, is loose and leaves you wondering if there was a point -something you could almost never say about the twilight zone. Is it, like another reviewer stated, a hyper literal portrayal of a woman rejecting all the things that make life worth while and becoming an actual lost soul? I don't know that the movie lets us know enough about Mary to come to that conclusion. (Maybe it's all just a dramatized depiction of an undead beauracrat correcting a paperwork mistake.) <br />Plot, I don't think, is what this movie should stand or fall on.<BR>Atmosphere seemed to take precedence with the film's creators(the director, Herk Harvey, told his writer, John Clifford, that he didn't care what he wrote about, except that he wanted to make a movie that had dead people dancing under the Saltair dome).  From this point of view, I think, the movie is very successful. Carnival effectivly creates a tone of strangeness and dread that is sustained almost throughout it's length. It reminded me much more of the silent film, Nosferatu, than any modern horror movie (the nearly omnipresent pipe organ score might have something to do with that).<br />Candace Hilligloss, who plays the main character, Mary, does an excellent job in her role as a brittle, eccentric young woman, right down to the hand and body movements. She also has the perfect looks for the part; doe eyed and blond, with long, pale hands that look like they were made for playing music (a church pipe organ, in this instance). It's a pity she wasn't in more movies (she, rather admirably, retired from films to raise her children). Another good actor who went on to do really nothing else on the big screen, Sidney Berger, has the only other very important speaking role in the film. He's also does quite well in a very unsympathetic part as Mary's slimy neighbor. <br />There's one scene in this movie that really sticks in mind; the one where Mary visits the deserted interior of Saltair for the <br />first time. The scene has no real action, aside from Mary just walking around, but it's effect is quite eery ( it concludes in an utterly sinister shot, which may possibly have been what Peter Jackson was thinking of in the dead marshes sequence of The Two Towers). What I believe this scene trades on is the strangeness, the unwholesome sensation that comes of being alone in a large, festive, public place. A personal experience of mine which parallels this scene -I'm certain it's part of why this movie had such an effect on me-  is my memory of walking around the desserted ruins of the massive, domed Baden Springs luxury resort in Indiana (it's since been gloriously restored, apparently) when I was a kid back in the 80's. I've never quite forgotten the lonely and desolate sensation it inspired.<br />Having said all that, I don't believe it's a perfect movie by any means. There's bad acting from bit players, at least a few near camp moments, mostly at the beginning (I was nearly expecting, was almost afraid, that the deadly drag race at the start of the movie would veer into a wooden PSA from some beefy sheriff). I think how much of an impact this movie has on you will depend on when you watch it, who you watch it with (watch it alone), and whether you will allow yourself to get caught up in it's mood. There's no real violence, nothing that will involuntarily repulse you. If you want to give it the MST3K treatment, parts of the movie will certainly lend itself to that, or ifyou sit in front of the television, cross your arms and determine not to let this film get to you, then I think you will very probably stand up unfazed. Speaking personally, I think there are a number of things that I'll never quite look at again in the same light, after seeing this picture.
B00006690G|4.0|Eminem has really grown since his first album. This album is mostly serious, but does poke fun at the world, just in a different way. You can tell from the production, except for \\"without me\\", rest of the beats are all serious. Throughout listening to the Eminem triology, theres 1 common problem: SKITS. At least he took off the annoying homosexual Ken Kaniff off the, Steve Berman skits are getting very old, finally he kills Steve even though Steve wasnt complaining about how his album sucks instead saying it was his best work. Intro and Outro are just curtain sounds, Ken Kaniff comes out in outro but did not say anything out of the line nasty. \\"Paul Rosenburg\\" brought no point either. Singles \\"Without me\\" is this playful song about how world needs some controversy, not his best work. \\"Cleaning Out Of My Closet\\" is a single about how his mom had problems and neglected him and how he loves his daughter and hates his wife. These were never my favorite topics from Eminem, \\"Sing For The Momment\\", had a great message to it, for the last time, what he says on albums are not real and if people do stuff because of him they need a reality check. \\"Superman\\" is a song about him sayin that girls are not loyal and will leave you, eventhough the video never came out officially, but the song does give a slow jamm and are played on radio repitedly. Other songs all stand out, same usual guest apperances by his Shady Aftermath crew and Dr. Dre. Nate Dogg sang great hook and the song had a great message using getting into the rap game as a metaphor for how you should always excel to your best. \\"my Daddy gone crazy\\" is a silly song about how hes daughter sees him go crazy. Like other Eminem albums, all the songs stands out and there is not much to skip. <br />ProductioN: A<BR>Delivery: A-<BR>Lyrics: A-<BR>OVerall: A-

B00004T9UF|5.0|The critics are blaming Eminem for kids actions and the rebellant teenagers. If you are not to mature enough to listen to some rap and know when someone is joking and being serious, you've got some growing up to do. This album is not like the first one \\"The Slim Shady LP\\", he poked fun at the world and all of the wrong things in more of a darked way instead of playful beats and lyrics like the first album. Admit it or not, Eminem has some of the best rhymes and lyrics in the industry right now. He makes words that doesnt rhyme and make it sound rhyming and does it naturally unlike some rappers whoo just does it to make them look good. Dr. Dre's beats are bangin, they are not too flashy like the Down South raps but they are good, solids, beats. D12 made their first appearance on this CD. \\"Under The Influence\\", D12 displayed their lyrical skills and Bizzaare showed why he is called Bizzaare. Again, some people might find his sick, perverted style offensive and bad influence but if you are not mature enough to know if he is just playing, you need to just stay away from rap albums. <br />Lyrics: A+<BR>Production: A+<BR>Delivery: A<BR>Overall: A+
055357342X|3.0|Martin writes well enough, but I am afraid he has come down with Jordan syndrome.  (...) The overtones of sexism are still there, whether intentional or not; and few of his characters make any progress or growth.  In particular, the way he treats Sansa seriously irritates me; I actually have to wonder if she's a stand-in for someone he doesn't like.  It's not the fact that he keeps putting her in dangerous situations; it's the fact that he refuses to allow her to learn to defend herself.  Daenerys still hasn't made it back to the Seven Kingdoms yet, and in fact shows no sign of doing so any time soon; Tyrion has taken off for parts unknown; Cersei remains as one-dimensional a [character] as she ever was, and so does Lysa until they off her. (...)<br />The darkness and slaughter of the main characters didn't really bother me, but someone on here had a good point that I hadn't considered until I read their review.  And that is:  If this is truly supposed to be a world based on the Middle Ages, then where is the yearning for spiritual fulfillment?  Where is the divine?    Christianity was a *huge* presence in the Middle Ages, for *everybody,* but we don't see anything like that in Martin's world; in fact his Seven are barely mentioned and certainly don't seem to be taken that seriously by anybody in his world.  He's essentially writing this series with a modern-day secular mentality, but this doesn't jive with his series construction.(...)
B000069CWE|3.0|After listening to Hybrid Theory, I was hooked, so I picked this up hoping it would be something special. Excuse me if I missed the boat and it said &quot;Reanimation&quot;, but I thought it was going to be new songs. After listening to track 1 which his depressing (BUT NEW) and has great sound to it I had my hopes up for this album. #2 is a remix of Point of Authority, there i found out what this album was. (Again I'm sorry if I didn't catch it and wasn't paying attention where it said remixs I just picked it up, bought it, listened to it, did not pay attention to it.) That proved to be a mistake. This is a remix album like P. Diddy's and I HATED THAT, so this didn't cut it for me either. This is a Punk ROCK Band get together and remix every original song and add their own taste to it thing. Some song did not sound bad, others did. However, the original songs like &quot;High Voltage feat. PHaroah Monch&quot; and &quot;My december&quot; are great. Other songs like &quot;Ent He End&quot; is just that they add a new guy whoo added a new versse and new beat to the song and left the singing to be acapella, that's basically it for the rest of the remix songs you hear. I never liked remix albums, this definitely did not change my opinion, if you never heard the first album, this might be good, but after hearing their best...just doesn't cut it.<br />Lyrics: B*<BR>Delivery: B*<BR>Production: D<BR>Overall: C-<br />*Same as Hybrid theory with different verses added
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Wrestlemania XX<BR>Madison Square Garden<BR>March 14, 2004<br />I knew that Wrestlemania XX could not live up to its hype.  It was given way too much hype, but as long as you don't expect a masterpiece, WM XX turns out to still be the best Wrestlemania.<br />DVD Info:<br />Disc 1<BR>- WrestleMania XX pay-per-view event part one (March 14th)<br />Disc 2 <BR>- WrestleMania XX pay-per-view event part two (March 14th)<BR>- Bonus interviews, Sunday Night Heat matches (aired March 14th on Spike TV), and WWE Hall of Fame ceremony footage/interviews (March 13th)<br />Disc 3 <BR>- WWE Films Presents: \\"The Mania of Wrestlemania\\" (aired March 12th on UPN)<BR>- Top 10 Matches of Wrestlemania special (aired March 9th on Spike TV)<BR>- WrestleMania History (photo gallery, factoids, official results) and WrestleMania trivia<br />Matches:<br />U.S. Championship<BR>Big Show [c] vs. John Cena<br />This was a good way to start WM XX with Cena capturing the gold.  This match was pretty good, I thought it should have been one of the last matches on the card.  This was definitely not main-event material, but it still had me entertained.  7/10<br />Fatal Four-Way for the World Tag Team Championship<BR>Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade vs. La Resistance vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Rob Van Dam & Booker T [c]<br />This match should have been an elimination match.  This was not one of the best tag team matches, but the reigning champions, (RVD & Booker) made this match somewhat exciting. 6.5/10<br />Chris Jericho vs. Christian<br />This was a surprisingly good match.  Although it was not even near the match between Y2J & HBK at last year's Wrestlemania, the ending made up for it.  This was an entertaining match, and the ending shocked me a little.  I was expecting Jericho & Christian to proclaim that they have been friends all along, but I was fooled.  8/10<br />Rock 'N Sock Connection vs. Evolution<br />This was a pretty good and.............funny match.  This did not have the best technical wrestling, but it still kept me watching it.  With Rock's recent return, i was a little dissapointed with the outcome.  7/10  <br />First-Ever Playboy Evening Gown Match<BR>Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler & Jackie Gayda<br />This was good, but not as good as I expected.  Since this was Wrestlemania, I expected something better, but I can't really complain, considering all 4 of these women are hot no matter what.  7/10<br />Cruiswerweight Open-Cruiserweight Championship<BR>Chavo Guerrero [c] vs Rey Mysterio vs Billy Kidman vs Jamie Noble vs Ultimo Dragon vs Funaki vs Akio vs Tajiri vs Shannon Moore vs Nunzio <br />This match was great.  Although, it could have been even better if it was given more time.  The ending was a bit sudden, but there was a lot of high-flyin' action throughout this contest. 8/10<br />Raw vs. Smackdown!<BR>Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar<br />Biggest dissapointment of the night.  However, it wasn't as bad as everyone has been saying.  It was a little bit like the Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior match a while back, this had lots of strength tests.  Even though this match was nothing spectacular, it was nice to see Lesnar get speared and jackhammered, Goldberg get F5'd, and Stone Cold Steve Austin stun both Lesnar & Goldberg.  5/10<br />Fatal Four-Way for the Tag Team Championship<BR>Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty [c] vs. The Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team vs. APA vs. Basham Brothers<br />Like I said before, I would have liked to see these tag matches be in elimination format.  I don't really care for any of these wrestlers, but I thought TSPWGTT should have won.  Okay match 6/10<br />Women's Championship<BR>Victoria [c] vs. Molly Holly (if molly loses, she must have her head shaved)<br />This was an alright women's match.  It was just like every other women's match.  It wasn't as good as last year's triple-threat between Victoria, Stratus, & Jazz, but this was still ok.  The best part was seeing Molly getting her head shaved.<BR>5/10<br />WWE Championship<BR>Eddie Guerrero [c] vs. Kurt Angle<br />This was a very good match, not as good as Lesnar vs. Angle last year at WM 19.  I was expecting Angle to win, but Guerrero won, giving this match a little suspense.  Good technical wrestling.  Although I like Guerrero, I would have liked to see Angle win.  8.5/10<br />The Dead Will Rise Again!<BR>The Undertaker vs. Kane<br />I was slightly disappointed with this match.  Taker's entrance was awesome, but entrances alone don't make matches live forever.  Undertaker didn't look like I was hoping him to, but he was still somewhat \\"scary\\" looking.  Pretty short match for such a long build-up.  7/10<br />Triple Threat for the World Heavyweight Championship<BR>Triple H [c] vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit<br />This was by far, the best match of the night, and easily the best match of 2004.  Very long, grueling match and wonderful performance from all three of these men. It was nice to see Chris Benoit finally win the title. 10/10<br />After the World Heavyweight Championship match, Guerrero came out to the ring and held Benoit's hand up in victory.  This was a memorable moment and a good way to end Wrestlemania XX.  <br />As I said at the top, this DVD will contain 3-discs.  I have already pre-ordered this DVD from Best Buy, and I advise you to do the same.  The DVD is $27.99 before tax and $29.95 w/tax.  <br />Wrestlemania XX is a must-buy for a real WWE Fan.
B000075BFK|5.0|There is really no point in argueing if 2Pac is alive or dead. Yes, he did consequentively release albums after he was dead. So what??? He may have pre-recorded million of songs, Digital Underground said, &quot;Pac recorded enough to release an new album every year after he is dead.&quot; Back to the album, he has hardcore gangsta style and it seems like he is still hates P. Diddy in Track 5. (That may show this album is pre-recorded) &quot;We Ballin&quot; is a banger, has great beat and 2Pac spits the Hit em up style lyric over it. Thugz Mansion is a great song with 2Pac talking about life after death and how peaceful it is even for the thugz. One problem about this album is that people who 2Pac would never work with appeared on the album, now that brings down the album. 2Pac's lyric is solid and at a level where the guest appearance would only bring down album unless they are at the same level. Production is great. Eventhough they did take 2Pac's stuff on it, it is much better than the Nu Mixx. Only guess appearance that diserved to be on the album and talk about how they knew 2Pac is the Outlawz. Nas, Jazzy Phe, Mya, Tyrese shouldn't have been on the album. Especially, 2Pac hated Nas. Even after that factor, theres no skip song on this song. Some songs might have flaws, because the guess appearances and remix beats, but 5 stars for Respect of 2Pac and his thugged out rhymes on this album.<br />Delivery: A+<BR>Lyrics: A+<BR>Production: A<BR>Overall: A+
B0000DJZAH|4.0|If you've only got a standard CD player and have the _original_ CD release of Tommy (not the mid '90's remaster), you may want to hold off on this purchase.  The stereo track hasn't been remixed at all, and the bonus disc, while novel, isn't anything you'll be listening to over and over.  If you're used to the 1990's remaster, you'll notice some differences, though.  Which version you like better will pretty much be personal preference, as both have their merits.<br />However, the 5.1 SACD layer was remastered by Pete Townshend himself.  It extends at least one track slightly, brings out instruments and effects that weren't really audible before, and adds some nice, largely pretty subtle, surround effects.  It really is almost like hearing the album &quot;for the first time again,&quot; as the cliche goes!  The first thing I did when I bought my SACD player was to throw this disc on and sit quietly listening to the album, beginning to end.  It would have been nice to have the stereo CD audio layer contained a stereo-downmixed version of this surround remix, since it changes much more than just speaker placement of the music, but it's also nice that the CD contains the original version for historical purposes, along with the new, redone 5.1 version.
0684800713|3.0|The novel has its moments of greatness: fishing, bullfighting, and even Jake's swim--a rather life affirming, physically invigorating moment wherein the numbness induced by a week of Spanish fiesta seems to abate.  Nature is the thing that revives the deadness of human realtionships.  Nevertheless, reading this novel is like watching the development of a garden slug: you keep waiting for it to change into a butterfly, but it just never, ever happens.  I enjoy the majority of Hemingway's works, but, to be very honest, this is not his best effort, and certainly not worth the 5 stars that one might give Moveable Feast, Farewell to Arms, or many of his short stories. I give it three stars for its powerful, raw, descriptive moments (Tell us what you really think, Hemeinway) and the writer's ability to make me laugh aloud as I read.  And, although the climax is supposed to be anticlimatic, (just as the journey in Heart of Darkness is supposed to drag on and on and on...) I did not like the lack of one, single, horrible, terrific moment that would shake me enough to FEEL and remember the contents of the 245 pages I read, only to learn that human relationships are fragile,indescribable,and expensive.  Someone wrote that one would either love or hate this book--I think that I am one who loves AND hates it.  Maybe that is the genius of it--maybe that is for the lack of genius.  People say, &quot;You HAVE to like Hemingway..&quot;  I say,&quot;It is okay not to share popular literary opinion, but it is not okay to deny yourself the experience of reading this book.&quot;

B00000DCHD|5.0|I was given '52nd Street' for my 15th birthday along with Breakfast in America by Supertramp (1979). It was many years before I discovered &quot;The Stranger&quot;. I just read the main review here and found that my two favorite tracks are the same songs that Mr. Blackstock has trashed in his 'critical review'. Hogwash!<br />If you liked the power and frustration of &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, then you'll most likely enjoy the harder-edged tracks on this album like &quot;Stiletto&quot;, &quot;Zanzibar&quot; (my two faves), and &quot;Big Shot&quot;. Joel is as much a macho guy from the City as he is a romantic songwriter.  &quot;Honesty&quot; and &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes&quot; are fine examples of his tender side.
B000069HZP|1.0|The movie keeps you guessing, right up until the end.  The end reveals just how baseless the movie is.  Think about it....the movie is based on something that simply put, would never happen, not even a chance.  Again, what are the odds that a guy trapped in a taxi cab that goes over a seawall, survives?....same guy falling many stories......survives?  Happy birthday???  Awful, insulting.  Sick.
0385504209|3.0|This book grabbed my attention from the beginning and by its midpoint, I was trying to veryify the information on the internet. A lot of what is in the book is based on fact, and a lot of it is speculation and then the rest is pure fiction. Still, it's a fun read and a good mystery. The reason for the 3 stars is that I thought Dan Brown chickened out toward the end and took the easy road out. The story is far-fetched in parts and I don't even mind that but he started with a certain premise and then abandoned it. I no longer understand why the priory is holding so dear the location of the grail. Who are they protecting it from????

B0001ENY6M|3.0|I agree with the reviewer from Arnold , Md. that this soundtrack is very derivative of Peter Gabriel's &quot;Passion&quot;. Originally I thought some of Gabriel's music might be used in the film. The original trailer, which appeared on the films website prior to it's release, used a piece of Gabriel's score from &quot;The Rabbit Proof Fence.&quot; I don't know if this was authorized by Gabriel or not but it shows that in all probability Debney used Gabriel's music as a model. In &quot;The Last Temptation Of Christ&quot; I felt Gabriel's music was the highlight of a flawed film and more than stands on it's own as a work of art. With &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; I feel the opposite is true. While the music in no way diminishes this very powerful film I don't think it stands as well on it's own as Gabriel's &quot;Passion&quot;. Skip Debney and get Gabriel. Even though it's not the soundtrack to &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; I have a feeling most listeners will conjure images from Gibson's film while listening to this incredible score. Also this recording has been remastered and repackaged in a limited edition. Hopefully with the success of Gibson's film people will seek out this recording and hear what was most likely the inspiration for Debney's score.
6305907145|5.0|This film takes considerable licence with the original text, so if you are an Austen-purist, you may want to pass it by. On the other hand, Mansfield Park is not generally reckoned among Austen's best work, and in my opinion it benefits rather a lot from the extra dimensions, the darker undercurrents and the sheer zest added by the movie-script. As does the character of Fanny Price, who is transformed from the rather insipid victim and distant witness she is in the book, into a personality every bit as strong and outspoken as Elizabeth Bennet, making her the pivotal force in the drama. Her character is fleshed out further by turning her partly into Jane Austen herself: the delightfully whimsical correspondence with her sister in Portsmouth is all Austen's own. Thus reinforced, Fanny is well equipped to handle some very un-Austenlike situations; still, her walking in on Maria and Crawford \\"in flagrante delicto\\" may well give the authenticists a start. Henry Crawford is a rather more good-looking and charming character in the film than the book would have you expect (where Austen merely describes him as \\"not handsome\\", but in possession of \\"an air and countenance\\"), which makes Fanny's doubts and vacillations more readily understandable. The slave-trade issue, only touched upon lightly in the book, is taken to the forefront of the story, culminating in Fanny's discovery of Tom Bertram's sketchbook, containing graphic depictions of the horrors going on at his father's Antiguan estate - throwing a very sinister light on Sir Thomas in the process.<br />Inevitably, the additions to the story, the profiling of the main protagonists, and the retelling of 350+ pages in just over 100 minutes, mean that other characters are reduced to vignettes, or completely left out. I did not find this at all disturbing - in fact the caricaturist treatment of Mrs. Norris or Lady Bertram adds a lot of the required \\"comic relief\\".  Also, there are some hilarious tongue-in-cheek moments, as when, at the beginning of her fatal speech on the possible rehabilitation of Maria and Henry, Mary Crawford exclaims, \\"For heaven's sake, this is 1806!\\" Again, purists may object against this scene: in the book Mary entrusts her scheme only to Edmund, and Fanny hears it from him second-hand; but in the film Mary shares it with the entire Bertram family including Fanny, and with the added cynicism of speculating openly on the financial benefits to be had from Tom's probable death. It is then not Edmund, but Fanny who challenges her. It is a very liberal solution, but dramatically it works perfectly, providing an intense climax through a head-on clash of \\"good\\"  and \\"evil\\".<br />The cast is as good as that in any of the other high-quality Austen films we have had in recent years, but Frances O'Connor deserves to be singled out; she has tremendous charm and charisma, and is a presence powerful enough to carry the entire movie on her own. Jonny Lee-Miller, whom you might well associate with a rather different type of work, is a very convincing Edmund, and Harold Pinter gives us a suitably troubled and complex Thomas Bertram.<br />The entire film exudes an unsentimental, even cool atmosphere; in terms of cinematography, the eye can feast on many gorgeous images, at times Vermeer-like in their stark beauty. The choice to \\"cast\\" the fantastic ruins of Kirby Hall as Mansfield Park is a masterstroke, making it clear right from the start that all is not well with the Bertrams (why a completely different house is shown on the box cover is beyond me...). All in all, even though the DVD offers literally nothing at all in the way of extra's, this is still very highly recommended!as when, at the beginning of her fatal speech on the possible rehabilitation of Maria and Henry, Mary Crawford exclaims, \\"For heaven´s sake, this is 1806!\\" Again, purists may object against this scene: in the book Mary entrusts her scheme only to Edmund, and Fanny hears it from him second-hand; but in the film Mary shares it with the entire Bertram family including Fanny, and with the added cynicism of speculating openly on the financial benefits to be had from Tom´s probable death.

B0001ENYKS|5.0|After one listen of their self-titled debut, you too will agree that they should be labled royalty.  'The Archdukes,' as it were, present one of the finest albums of recent memory with a truly infectious package.<br />The album's first track Jacqueline starts off somewhat sombre but don't expect it to last that way for long.  From there on, the music is fast and nearly impossible not to rock to.  From the two-songs-in-one package of Take Me Out to Darts of Pleasure and Michael, it'd be just about impossible to hear this album and find yourself NOT rocking along.  This comes highly recommended -- it's truly not to be missed.
B000002KLZ|5.0|This live album from 1980 is a rare insight on the band's marathon-tour in support of the &quot;Tusk&quot; album. Not only does it allow the casual listener to discover hidden gems like &quot;Don't Let Me Down Again&quot;, &quot;One More Night&quot; &quot;Fireflies&quot; or &quot;Over &amp; Over&quot;, it also enables the true Mac fans to capture a milestone in the band's history.<br />The recording is impressive; songs like &quot;Landslide&quot; or &quot;Never going back again&quot; feature such intimate readings, that you can even wonder if they were truly recorded live - that is, until a deluge of applause happens as the songs conclude. Other songs like &quot;I'm so afraid&quot; or &quot;Not that funny&quot; are a testimony to the mad genius displayed by Lindsey Buckingham on stage. Christine McVie is as good as always, with flawless performances of &quot;Over my head&quot; and &quot;Say you love me&quot;. And Stevie Nicks delivers an achingly beautiful version of &quot;Sara&quot;, less polished but more emotional than on the album version, where her voice is both sensitive and soaring. The band no longer performs &quot;Sara&quot; in their concerts, based on Stevie's wish, and judging from this version, one can only wonder why. This is the only official live version of &quot;Sara&quot; ever released, which is reason enough to purchase the album.<br />There are plenty of high points on this album, such as &quot;Rhiannon&quot; (less subdued and more rocking than the version later found on &quot;The Dance&quot;), &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Oh Well&quot; and the ethereal cover of Brian Wilson's &quot;The Farmer's Daughter&quot;. There isn't a weak moment on this album; and although it would have been nice to have songs like &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;, &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot; and &quot;Songbird&quot;, it's still one of the finest live albums ever recorded.
0385504209|1.0|Before you part with any cold hard cash, think back to your first creative writing class... now, remember the clunky prose and paper-thin characterizations of the least talented class members.  This will give you an idea of how The DaVinci Code reads.<br />Don't get me wrong:  I'm no literary snob, and I love a good Michael Crichton or Stephen King as much as the next person, but The DaVinci Code was no Firestarter.  Many of the theories it hints at are never developed;  the editor (if there was one) was clearly asleep at the wheel;  and the characters themselves are so clich&eacute;d and unbelievable that you will soon find you are only reading to find out how it all ends.  In short, Dan Brown makes John Grisham look like Shakespeare.<br />However, despite its flaws, this novel is not without merit:<br />BONUS #1:  Dialogue so stilted you will laugh out loud.<br />BONUS #2:  Possibly the lamest, least imaginative, most one-dimensional rendering ever of an uptight Brit by an American author... found myself wondering less where the holy grail was and more why on earth Brown chose to revive such a dull, DOA stereotype for one of his main characters.<br />BONUS #3:  You DO have a chance in hell of getting published after all!<br />For a somewhat better read on the same subject, I recommend The Prophetess by Barbara Wood.<br />For author Dan Brown, I recommend Creative Writing 101 and a seasoned editor!
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I love this music.  It's a personal experience that brings what you're envisioning at home all alone or seeing on a screen in a theater right into your heart and soul.  It makes the situation inescapable.  You can't ignore that they are nailing the Man to a cross....He is dying for you and you can't stop it and He won't....He loves us enough not to.  Can we wrap our minds around the idea of a love that deep in this world as we know it?  I don't believe so.  It's pain, it's hope, it's love, it's suffering, it's violent and it's peaceful........but most of all, it's perfect.  Just like Him.  This music brings those thoughts and feelings back to life inside me every time I listen to it.  It fills me up when I'm empty and picks me up when I feel like I can't go any further.
0792844793|4.0|In many respects - well, almost every respect - this is a brilliant film. The contrast between the violence and seaminess of Frank's world and the laughable banality of Jeffery's world comes across perfectly. Dennis Hopper's performance as Frank really cannot be praised enough. Sure, he's impressive when he's huffing nitrous oxide and hitting Jeffrey across the face, but his expression while listening to the old lounge songs - melancholy, regretful - is equally convincing, and he's almost sympathetic. Also classic is the moment when another character proposes to toast his health, and he mutters: 'Aw, let's drink to something else.' Jeffrey's Reeve-like blankness is a good foil for him.<br />That said, there's just something - something about the random imagery inserted, like subliminal shots but held for longer, images of a snuffed candle and insects - something about the pacing, the long silences and occasional anticlimax - and something about the surprising semi-happy ending - that doesn't work. I feel like I'm missing something, and maybe I just am, but I don't feel like Lynch accomplished everything he set out to do. Just when it could be frightening, it lapses into comedy. This vagueness may be part of the message - life isn't black-and-white, or clean - but still. The movie is effective, but it doesn't resonate.
B000059HB7|5.0|Howard Hawks, director of \\"Rio Bravo\\" had a belief in people. He rejected the idea that, in a democracy, there exists people who can be thrown away. Critic Robin Wood wrote, \\"If I were asked to choose a film that would justify the existence of Hollywood, I think it would be 'Rio Bravo.'\\"<br />  When Joe Burdett (Claude Akins) kills an unarmed man, Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) takes him into custody, but Burdett's brother Nathan is one of the richest men in town, and he doesn't like his brother being locked up. With his town full of Burdett's men Chance is in trouble but he has a few folks willing to help - he's got Dude (Dean Martin), an ex-deputy and recent ex-drunk, and Stumpy (Walter Brennan), a cripple who has long been Chance's assistant. His old friend Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) tries to help, but Chance rejects it, figuring any outsiders would just be more targets for Burdett's gang to shoot at - something proven when Wheeler is killed. Slowly, others join Chance's side: Feathers (Angie Dickinson), a card player who falls for Chance; gunman Colorado (Ricky Nelson), one of Wheeler's men; and Carlos (Pedro Gonzales-Gonzales), the local hotel owner. All the while Chance - who doesn't want help -  can use the help his friends provide.<br />\\"Rio Bravo\\" offers us great brush strokes on a democratic canvas , a film about a  bunch of folks that operate on the feeling that there really is no one to waste.<br />Early in the film when Wheeler realizes who's standing with Chance against the Burdetts, he says, \\"A bum-legged old man and a drunk. That's all you got?\\" and Chance answers, \\"That's what I got\\" and the way he says it you know that he doesn't mind a bit.<br />\\"Rio Bravo\\" is the most relaxed of movies. A film that moseys through its over two hour length and it always has time to slow down for a song, or banter among Chance and friends. Hawks and his actors seem to forget about the plot for long periods just hanging out, enjoying each others company.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie is so good, it's difficult to explain why. Some intellectual types have justified liking it with lines like this: 'It's a ridiculous plot, but Tarantino pulls it off with so much style that it's enjoyable.' This is a considerable understatement. Tarantino pulls it off with so much style that it makes you wonder if it is ridiculous, after all. He's found such a way of working with these cliches and scenes of mindless blodshed that it's an insult to use words like 'cliche' and 'mindless' anymore. Really, I don't even understand what he's done, I can only bow down in awe of it. This movie is the highest class of art. It's life-altering. Buy it. You can't own the original of the Mona Lisa, but you can own this movie.
0440237688|5.0|This book is an incredible page-turner that makes one appreciate the darker aspects of life. The seemingly utopian world that Jonas inhabits is in fact a cover for a multitude of shocking secrets that lie below the surface, such as \\"realeasing\\" any child that is not perfect. The book's ending makes the reader think and offers many possibilities for the future. I recommend the book to readers of all ages.
015626224X|4.0|If your looking for a basic start, middle, end story then down and out is not for you.  However, if you are looking for an honest insight in to the conditions of both Paris and London in the early 1900s then you have the right book.  One can understand Orwell's plight and dedication in this book because of the fact that he has came from a wealthy middle class family and chooses to live like this.  The book starts in Paris where the levels of poverty for the majority of people are shocking, unrecognisable by todays standards.  Yet through Orwell's imagery and attention to detail even a teenager of the 21st century can imagine the filth and insanitary conditions of both towns.  My favourite part of the book was the part in Paris.  this is because the friendships he makes and the job he ends up with despite being horrific make the reader feel warm and that despite this hardship he is happy.  The conditions in London and the description of the tramps and their way of life is sad and really makes you realise how lucky you are.  A frank account.
B00005JMFO|4.0|I was only mildly interested in seeing this movie, but I really enjoyed it.  Yes, there was an amazing amount of different threads to follow as this film told the story of nine or ten different people and their partners over a five week period leading up to Christmas.  Nevertheless, the witty script and the first rate acting made the whole process relatively painless.<br />There was charm in abundance from Hugh Grant, playing Hugh Grant as usual, but he does it so well that you can't help but warm to him.  Martine McCutcheon as his love interest was surprising unannoying, and not in the least bit chubby!<br />Plenty of laughs from Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher as a faded rock star and his long-suffering manager.  Colin Firth in pursuit of his Portuguese maid also provided a few laughs courtesy of the language barrier, and the nerdish caterer with his dreams of being a sex god based soley on the strength of the lure of his British accent would have on American women kept the humour flowing.<br />Acting kudos go to Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson and most notably Emma Thompson.  Ms Thompson once again plays the kind of gung-ho, upper middle class woman who has contributed to my usual dislike of her chosen roles, but she outdid herself in this slight role.  I was moved to tears by her brilliant acting performance in the scene where she retreats to her bedroom to adjust to the knowledge that her husband is having an affair with his secretary.<br />Eye candy was provided for both sexes in the shape Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln.  I enjoyed their storyline, despite it's flaws, but that may be because I'm just a sucker for physical beauty.  Laura Linney and her erstwhile Latino lover were also very attractive, but slightly less sympathetic.  And what can I say about the wonderful performances given by young Thomas Sangster and Liam Neeson as his grieving stepfather?  Excellent, believable acting rescuing a storyline that verged on unashamed bathos.<br />Overall, I would recommend this film and commend Richard Curtis for an enjoyable, feel-good movie that left me smiling with tears in my eyes.ecommend this film and commend Richard Curtis for an enjoyable, feel-good movie that left me smiling with tears in my eyes.

B00009ATIX|5.0|When I read Stanislaw Lem's book many years ago I remember Solaris as a living ocean with peculiar qualities.  The planet somehow managed an unstable orbit between two stars.  This is what caught earth's scientist's attention in the first place. Part of the search for intelligent life in the cosmos.  Lem's intelligent life is wonderfully baffling.  He looks at the human need to personify and communicate.  But to communicate something you have to have some common ground.  Lem's stunning premise was to look at an attempt at human-alien communication very uncompromisingly.  <br />    Soderbergh focusses the movie on the question, \\"How do we perceive ourselves and others and how vital is this to the communication process?\\"  Lem and Soderbergh both see the story from the eys of Psychiatrist Kelvin [Clooney].  Soderbergh's opening scenes stress this man's grief and attempts to recover from his wife's suicide.  He's soon asked by a long time astronaut friend for help with a delicate situation on a space station orbiting Solaris.  Wham! In no time Kelvin is totally befuddled at the mysteries he sees as he boards the space station.  There is almost no dialogue, revealing camera shots period.  Two surviving astronauts offer cryptic advice.  Snow says \\"I can tell you what is going on, but that really wouldn't tell you what is going on\\"  Gordon says \\"Until it happens to you, there is really no point in discussing it\\".  Not much help from our director there.  What \\"happens\\" is the living ocean presents each astronaut with a dreadful gift.<br />    The alien's \\"gift\\" to the earthling's was to generate in near perfect [to atomic] detail, the flesh and blood of whatever life was preoccupying the dreams of the astronauts.  Kelvin's visitor is his ex-wife Rheya. Clooney does a great job portraying Kelvin's repulsive reaction at first.  He banishes the mysterious woman, who couldn't be anything but a monster.  When she soon reappears, he opens his mind and begins dialogue with this person, played with wonderful grace and style by McElhone. The physicist on board is obsessed with figuring out how Solaris achieved these creatures and is hell bent on physically destroying them.  Snow's visitor disappeared long back.  And Kelvin approaches hs wife at first as a kind of grief therapy and then is slowly drawn into admiring and actually loving her all over again.  In consistent professional style, he tries to figure out how his memories of Rheya were manifest by Solaris.  Both he and Rheya look at who she is, and who she is becoming.  And how she is changing him.  <br />   What happens when reality becomes memory, and then memory is slowly warped and faded?  And who am I anyway?  How well do I know my wife of many many years?  And if I leave my kids for four years will I be able to enter their lives as a loving father based on our mutual memories of our past relationship? <br />The end makes you think about life and death.  Intergalactic mixed-species communication is intense and complex. The soundtrack fits.  The art draws Solaris as a beautiful floating blue nerve bundle.  This movie, like the book, is very imaginative, lively, challenging and original.  It casually dances between the spiritual and metaphysical and physical.  Not for everybody but this really isn't science fiction.  It's something else.
B0001ENY6M|3.0|You really can't tell how well the album sounds due to the fact you can only hear 30 seconds of the songs. On the frist two songs, they where just getting started, so you really can't judge. They do start of nicely, but it would be really nice to hear a little more of each song.

0783225849|3.0|.In the beginning of the film &quot;Psycho,&quot; by Alfred Hitchcock, was a film that didn't catch my attention.  The film seemed to be moving by with out a lot of excitement in the start and really felt as if it was getting no where.  Astonishingly towards the end of the film I found myself getting into the movie and realized that it had some great suspense.<br />     In the beginning the main female character, Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh), is trusted to deposit 40,000 of cash in to the bank for her employer.  Once she has a hold of the money, Marion plays a fake sickness and is supposed to be heading home after the deposit, only that's not what happens. Marion is quick to high tail it out of town with her hopes of starting over with a new life in Arizona.  She is heading towards Arizona for the fact that she wants to be with her divorced lover Sam, whom has only been meeting her<BR>secretly in cheesy hotels, yet he has no idea she is coming.  This part in the film was unsurprising, from one scene to another, I knew what was going to be happening before it even happened.  A movie that is so predictable isn't worth watching.<br />     As Marion is on the run she is pulled over by a police officer.  The acting in this scene is what made me angry with the character of Marion.  Although she was trying to act innocent, she practically told the officer - I'm guilty.  It's like when you see someone do something and then confront them and they deny it even though you were there. They try and hide the fact that they are lying, but you can see right through them.   He of course got this impression right away also, but surprisingly she gets away with out much questioning. <br />     In need of a place to rest for the night, the famous Bates Motel is the choice for our female runaway.  Even though the creepy look of the motel would be enough to make me jump in my car and drive away as quickly as possible, the young man Norman Bates<BR>(played by Anthony Hopkins) enters, fears are calmed by his charms.  A long chat between these two characters Marion and Norman, showed Norman had a bit of a spark towards Marion, but because everything was so quiet and lifeless during this scene, it left me in a bore and almost asleep. The scene seemed to last a half an hour when it was probably only around seven minuets.   <br />     As Marion is brutally murdered in the famous shower<BR>scene, after her conversation with Bates, and her body disposed of, the movie seemed to have nothing left to go off of since the main<BR>female character was now dead. Since Bates's mother was confirmed the killer by Norman himself during some shouting from the house when blood was discovered gave this away.  But oddly enough, when someone did come, detective Arbogast was also killed by the mother.  Little did I know that my views on this movie were about to change.<br />     &quot;Psycho&quot; constantly lead me astray from what I<BR>assumed was the truth, and the film became a lot more appealing than what it seemed earlier on.  It was now not just some horror movie, but a thriller too.  The suspense started to manipulate my views and caused doubt as to what really happened to Marion when she was killed in the shower.  I wondered who the killer is really.<br />     The twist in the end of this film was great.  It was<BR>something that I didn't even think about as I was trying to solve the mystery.  As a first time viewer of any of the Hitchcock films the twist alone is what makes me want to watch another one of his films. Just to see what other kinds of stories he has come up with.
B00018D44U|2.0|I absolutely loved her first CD but am really disappointed with this one. Many of the songs sound like country music, which I just despise. It hurts my ears to hear the scratchy voice of Dolly Parton singing with such a talented young artist. I hope Nora's turn toward country is just a passing whim and she will return to her previous self soon. One song I do like is the last one, &quot;Don't Miss You at All&quot;, which is devoid of that hillbilly twang.
B00004Z459|5.0|I think Linkin park was the first the mix rap and rock together and they do their work perfecly..<br />Papercut : One of my favorite cause the begining of the song is simply amazing like it<br />One step closer : The first song that I ve heard from them and belive me I dont stay indiferent.<br />With you : Still a very good song, simple, good remix.<br />Crawling : Awesome song I really love the chorus ..

B00015HVI8|5.0|It was really exciting, I got this set before the season had even finished on broadcast TV(we're a year behind without cable). Audio commentaries are always good for a laugh, but the Directors featurettes weren't as good as the video diaries from the season 5 DVDs. Overall good times.

0739302043|4.0|After hearing so much about the book I picked up the audio CD so I can listen while I was driving.  I was pleasantly surprised by the pace of the book.  The book was always moving forward and always left you hanging for the next chapter.  The story follows the death of the curator of the Louvre and leads to a quest for the Holy Grail and a possible truth about Jesus Christ that could topple Christianity.  What I love most about this book is that the author took a long series of true events and weaved them together with just enough fiction to make it seem so believable.  To me this is a sign of a good book.  It makes you follow the story because you think it is true but the author's imagination takes you to a fictional place your own mind would not have gone too.<br />The story to uncover the Holy Grail is well laid out by Dan Brown.  The book really takes place over teh course of two days but so much happens in those two days.  Reminds me of the fast pace that the TV show 24 has made so successfull.<br />I am Jewish and not an expert at all on Christianity, but the truthful and fictional tales woven together about Christ and the Holy Grail were so fascinating.  Add a long history of a Secret Society that guards a secret the Vatican wants to remain a secret, but one that the society is obligated to reveal.  What could the secret be that would topple an entire religion.  Why would a secret society exist to guard it and how is the Church going to protect itself?  More importantly, why is a museum curator for the Louvre a central figure that ties all of this together?<br />The questions above are an indication of the wonderful ideas the book brings out and makes you think.  There is suspense as the two main characters follow a series of cryptic codes left by the curator and are followed by the police and a killer who is being ordered by a very powerful man behind the scenes.  Is the Church involved?<br />Then there is the question of the secrets of the Holy Grail?  Are these two characters following clues that will ultimately lead to the Holy Grail?  What is the secret that could ruin the church and what does it have to do with the Holy Grail?<br />I could not stop stop listening to the CD as I needed these questions answered.  THis book fulfilled my desires, a great suspenseful story that realy made me think and question things as they are.  I recommend this as a great pleasure read or listen.<br />Of course the overriding question to all of these subplots, is what does this also have to do with leonardo Da Vinci???  These questions make you want to read or hear more and keep you captivated.<br />I know other reviewers criticize the book for certain factual mistakes.  However, I took the book for what it was, a fictional novel.  You have to suspend your belief somwhat.  I feel the author's research and touch of fiction have made the story seem so realistic and possible, which is the sign of a great book.  It makes you question real facts even though such facts were introduced in a fictional work.  Even when the fringes of fiction come through the truth, your quest to follow in the character's excitement makes you jump into their shoes and it feels realistic. I think I can let a few historical &quot;stretches&quot; slip by when I am reading fiction because it is not a documentary.  Personally I was so swept up in the story, I really would not notice anything incorrect unless I did the research myself.<br />This book has spurred numerous discussions about Christ, Mary Magdelegne and Christianity and the Church.  How awesome is such a work of fiction that it makes us question reality??<br />The writing style is very straightforward and clear and easy to follow.  The text moves quickly and there is not one point where it slows down, making you want to read more and more.  Pick it up and jump in with both feet.these two characters following clues that will ultimately lead to the Holy Grail?

0694526088|5.0|This CD did it for me.  First good use of driving time, but more importantly, you hear the Author and his passion for this subject.  On top of this what he had to say was very compelling.  If you believe you can be better than you are now, READ THIS!  It will help.  A must read for anyone who is serious about their work, play and home life!  :)
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Over a thousand reviews already. Who would expect a movie like this would excite so much commentary? And who would expect it to be so controversial? I don't see anything there that I'd expect people to get so worked up about. <br />I am amused though to see the occasional comment about &quot;insiders&quot; getting rewarded ... obviously from people who have not much idea about how Hollywood works, or who have forgotten that for long chunks of his career even Francis Ford Coppola could not get films made. Money is the key.<br />&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; cost small change for Hollywood. Probably less than the Lord of the Rings trilogy spent on catering. According to one English paper that 4 million dollar budget has so far brought in 44 million, NOT counting DVD (or maybe overseas markets). THAT is how and why films get money in Hollywood. And rewards. Ever known a flop win Best Picture Oscar? Even &quot;Titanic&quot; has never made 11 times its budget. And all the hype in the world can't do that.<br />That gladdens my heart. I can't remember if it was P.T. Barnum or H.L. Mencken who said &quot;No one ever lost money underestimating the (American) public&quot;. Most Hollywood films prove him right. <br />The fact that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; can make money also proves the opposite is true. That you can believe in the intelligence and insight of enough of the public (maybe - judging from what I've read here - more outside of America than in) and still make money.<br />In London we get to see a lot of European movies, and we don't always think a movie is an &quot;art film&quot; just because it has subtitles. Or just because it is not middle-of-the-road. Or because it moves at its own pace.<br />It's true &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a young person's film. But let's not forget most of Mozart's work is a young person's work too. When US movies seem to worship the young - at the expense of the mature - I don't even see why anyone complains about youth.&quot;Jaws&quot; was a young person's film too. So was &quot;Star Wars&quot; (which remains irredeemably childish). Maybe people only complain about youth when it makes a movie to which they are unable to respond. <br />&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; speaks to the head and the heart. This story of an actor perhaps a little past his prime, and a young woman who is realising her marriage and life are going nowhere, is a film of rare insight and delicacy. It's beautifully judged, and walks a knife-edge where the relationship of these two adrift individuals in Tokyo is concerned. A directorial or writing mis-step either way and the whole edifice would come tumbling down. The fact that it doesn't is a superb reflection on Miss Coppola's abilities as a director. Many veteran directors could have done no better.<br />There was a time when Hollywood made many intelligent and subtle films like this and huge audiences - even in the US - loved them. One wonders what has happened when doing so causes so much outrage in the modern world. Even &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; would probably infuriate the Matrix crowd today.
B000002KXV|5.0|I must admit I knew nothing about Mr. Fagen when I bought this CD. I knew that Marcus Miller, one of my favorite bassit is playing on it, so I bought it. On my first listen I found myself, more than once, nod my head with amazement in response to a praticullarly good phrase, and on second listening, I decided it's one of my best CDs. Donald Fagen is a talented writer and a gifted composer and arranger. He had assembeled some of the best players around, and together they create a fun, funky and delighting music, that'll make you have a good time.<BR>To the bassists among you, like myself, I'd say that you won't be disappointed. You'll hear great bassits, more and less known, accompany Fagen, and do it with inspiring skill. After all, with all the fun of being a leader, us bassits also have the accompanying job to do, and this CD is defiently learning it from the masters.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanya's album is really nice.What he is raping about is the truth. One this album he's introducing his own style and is making sure that everyone that listens to it know what his style is. I like what this album represents. It gives you the truth on some songs but then he flips it and have fun with the songs.The fact that Kanya raps about god on that &quot;Jesus Walks With Me&quot; really specks the truth even though the the truth hurts so that wins a lot of pionts with me. Also Kanya is representing for the Chi that alson win points.

B00018D44U|2.0|I agree with the reviewers that found the album dissapointing and quite boring. It is pleasant to the ear, but that's about it.
B000059MEK|4.0|i am a big fan of daft punk, i cant even tell u how many times i have listened to homework , just really brilliant... When i picked up DIscovery, i wasnt too happy. Alot more vocals added in and not only being very ... vocals but very annoying, it would have been a more solid album if they didnt include vocals, anyway that was only in the beginning  i listended to it many more times usually while i was drunk, it changed my perspective, although i still dont like the vocals it really is a good album and has some unforgetable moments 4 stars, BUT HOMEWORK STILL RULES
B0001ENY6M|5.0|The music using period instruments brings out what the sounds of two thousand years ago must have been like. It brings the sounds of Christ's time on earth personally to me.<br />While the Creator of the Universe does not need background music, I sometimes do. This soundtrack has been the perfect thing to listen to when I pray. I play it softly in the background and thank my Heavenly Father for my wife and children. It helps me find the words of forgiveness for taking my life for granted.<br />While I started as dust and will return to dust, all I can offer is my gratitude while striving to be like King David and the Psalms. A reaching up to Heaven by a very flawed man.
B00005LMBK|3.0|I bought this album after hearing Clint Eastwood blah blah blah. I believe that everyone who gave this album 1 star is wrong, and likewise the people who gave it 5 stars. There's some decent material on this, but overall it's a disappointment. Here's a rundown of the tracks on this album (out of 5 stars):    Re-Hash: *** - A weak intro- Kind of repetitive.  5/4: *** - Should be renamed to 3/5. This song has style, but it lacks in substance.  Tommorrow Comes Today: **** - One of the better songs on the album. Got a trip-hop-like feel to it.  New Genious (Brother): *** 1/2 - Decent.  Clint Eastwood: **** - This song is pretty good until you hear your corny exfriend who lies about everything singing it all the time. It also got way overplayed on MTV2 and the radio.  Man Research (Clappper): **** - Quality Song.  Punk - *** 1/2 - Another decent song.  Sound Check (Gravity): *** - Not the worst on the ablum, not the best.  Double Bass: ** 1/2 - Too repetitive.  Rock The House: **** - haha, Del is the man. Another quality track.  19-2000: **** 1/2 - Probably the best song on the album. The video's great too.  Latin Simone (Que Pasa Contigo): **** - What translates to \\"What's up with you\\" turns out to be another highlight of this album.  Starshine: ** - Probably the worst song on the album- dull, repetitious, and just plain crappy.  Slow Country: **** - I like this one. Don't know what to say about it though, sooooo...  M1 A1: ** 1/2 - The first minute and 40 seconds of this song is probably the worst minute and 40 seconds of my life, it's that bad. The song gets pretty good after that though, but it ends too shortly.  Dracula: *** 1/2 - Another decent track.  Left Hand Suzuki Method: *** - Just doesn't cut it. At the end of this track there is a remix of Clint Eastwood by Ed Case. So I'll review that too:  Clint Eastwood (Ed Case Remix): **** - Pretty Good Remix.    To sum things up, Gorillaz have talent and comparing this to most of the garbage they play on the radio, it's a breath of fresh air, but it's kind of like when you breathe out that air, there's garlic on your breath and your girlfriend has to smell it. Given some of the highlights of this album, it might be worth your money if you like listening to unique music. I'd suggest you just download the tracks I listed as being 4 stars or above though, because at times this album, like seeing the trailer for Garfield the movie, or The Matrix Reloaded, just kinda lets you down.
B00008VGL6|3.0|I bought this CD on a whim, being a fan of Depeche Mode and Martin's songwriting skills. When I listened to it, however, I was a little dissapointed. All the songs on this CD were written by someone else, not a drop of Martin's beautiful poetic structure anywhere. Don't get me wrong, the songs are beautifully arranged and performed in a wonderfully popish, electronic style, I just hope this isn't the start of a non-writing trend for Martin. All in all, if you liked Depeche Mode's &quot;Exciter&quot;, you'll like this.
630514415X|5.0|To me, this movie was and still my all-time favorite movie dealing with Basketball.The Plot was superb. Denzel acting chops were on point in this or any movie he has been in. Ray Allen was amazing in acting debut.I give it two thumb or ten toes up!!!<BR>Go cop that DVD!
B000000WZ4|5.0|DM fans pretty much see this as a weaker album in comparison with any of their 1980s stuff but seriously, they're just moping because Alan Wilder's gone. Yes they may lack his touch but what would that say about Alan if he went and nobody noticed any change in DM? They've simply matured but their music is as deep as it ever has been. Out of their 90s albums, this is the one to get.
0783225849|4.0|Alfred Hitchcock's classic movie Psycho helped define his later movies, titled The Golden Years. The way he portrays murder and sex is very subtle.  His trademark uses of over bearing mothers, relationships that do not last, theft, and madness. If you only see one Hitchcock movie in your lifetime make sure Psycho is the one you see.<BR> The movie opens eluding that Sam Loomis, played by John Gavin, was having sex with his lover Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh.  Following, Hitchcock throws in the element of theft when Marion steals a large sum of money and secretly runs away to meet up with her lover Sam. Look closely and you may catch a glimpse of Hitchcock. After stopping at the Bates Motel off of the main highway she meets the owner Norman Bates who says he is living with his mother. During an awkward dinner with Bates Marion finds out that he has a very overbearing mother who is not well, which is typical of a Hitchcock thriller. After dinner Marion retires to her room and the madness begins. Suspenseful music builds anticipation up to the famed shower scene where Marion is murdered. This throws in the common Hitchcock element of relationships that do not last since Marion and Sam cannot be together if she is dead. The remaining two thirds of the movie her sister, Sam and a private detective are trying to find Marion. Finally there is an intense climax on the premises of the Bates Motel that will have everyone on the edge of their seats. <BR> The thing that I found most refreshing about this movie was the fact that it did not need to show a massive amount of blood or even show the blade being stabbed into a person. His allusion to murder is inspirational. Hitchcock used suspenseful music building up to murders and then would have the camera show just the faces of terror and shock or the knife post-stabbing a victim. Modern day horror/suspense/thriller films use excessive blood and guts to try and shock you that I feel is an unnecessary use of film. Film makers should watch Psycho and take a lesson on what they could do to bring the violence and gore level in movies back down. <BR> His allusion to sex is also inspiring. Showing Sam and Marion putting their shirts back on lets the view know what was going on but did not have to show the actual act of sex. Modern movies go a little too far by actually showing the act and the actor and actresses naked bodies. Do we really need all of the nakedness and actions of the actors and actresses to know that they are having sex? <BR> When deciding whether to see the original 1960 Psycho or the 1998 remake, choose the classic. The scenes leading up to the famed shower scene were almost the same except when Norman, played by Vince Vaughn, takes down the picture on the wall and looks at Marion, played by Anne Hache. You get an image of Norman pleasuring himself while watching through the hole; just more than a little disturbing and unnecessary. The shower scene was not as effective in the remake because you see the blade going to stab her body but stops short of ever touching it. In the original they left the vision of the knife piercing her body to our imaginations. I also feel Vince Vaughn did not play as convincing a psycho as Anthony Perkins did in the classic. <BR>Everyone should see Hitchcock's classic thriller Psycho and if you have already seen it you should re-watch it looking for some of his classic Golden Years movie elements of sex, theft, madness, and relationships that do not last. This classic movie uses suspenseful music to keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie despite the lack of gore and provocative scenes, and don't bother to watch the remake it does no justice to the 1960 original.
B00005BL2A|3.0|I feel bad for initially giving this album only 3 stars when, after listen ing to it multip;e times, I discovered that it is just as good as Ultra. It's a bit 'heavier' meaining that they've gotten rid of a their old dance stly for a new meloncholy sound. It's quite a good sound too but you have to be more open minded about their style change.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is quite possibley the best movie I've ever seen. I actually saw it twice in theaters, something I've never done before. <BR>The movie is so effortless in its story telling and the acting is so exquisite it hardly seems to be scripted at all.<BR>People who don't appreciate this movie are simply too stupid to appreciate soemthing that isn't completely in your face all the time. If you want car chases this is not for you but if you're smart enough to appreciate it it's certainly worth owning
B00000HYXB|5.0|I know you've heard about 10,000 times now that this is their best album yet but It's not our fault that it actually is. This album probably has the best lyrics and the 'deepest' sound to it filled with emotions rather than just loud rock. You've probably also heard Blind Guardian, Iced Earth and Iron Maiden in the same sentence a lot but in my opinion, Iron Maiden doesn't really fit in with BG and IE. I personally don't think much of Iron Maiden but BG are closer to Queen than Iron Maiden with the more progressive rock style with folk/classical elements mixed with rock. If you like this album, also try Imagiunations from the Other Side - Blind Guardian and Iced Earth's 'Horror Show.
B000002GK1|5.0|This is soundgarden at their best.  Chris Cornell gives his best vocal recording ever on this album!! Didn't initially like the album but eventually grew to be a part of my life.
B000000H7I|5.0|Great album from what i would call the second wave of death metal. They took what Death and the many bands before Suffocation did and took it to the next level of extreme. Gutteral vokills, bone jarring bass, and skull crushing guitars that is what you will get with this release. Nothing but pure death!!! The way it's supposed to be. I truely give it 13 skulls out of 13 skulls. If you love extreme brutality then buy this release.
B00000K31Q|5.0|Opposite sisters in one house equals trouble.  <br />Bianca is your typical prep all into fashion and a hotsy tosty life.  Kat is the quiet loner who finds more satifsication relaxing at home than going to any type of party or social gathering. <br />New kid comes along adoring over Bianca.    His friend and him decide to make a plan to pair Kat with Patrick. <br />It's a hard trip to get Kat in a liking happy mood, much less to get her to a party that she must attend dually with her sister, or else.  The girl's have to live with an overbearing father who takes good watch over his girls. <br />I grew up with this movie and it is a definate high school flick funny for anyone.
0452279488|2.0|Based on the jacket blurb, I was hoping this would be a fun, literate romantic comedy. After the first two chapters, however, I found myself wishing Helen had a richer inner life, since Schine spends almost all her time detailing Helen's thoughts and feelings. Helen is too complacent and sold on her own charm and flirtatiousness to be interesting as a character we're supposed to identify with wholeheartedly. Jane Austen or Barbara Pym would know how to use irony to give us a larger perspective on Helen, but Schine really seems to expect us to fall in love with Helen. The references to books and reading (Helen owns a bookshop) end up feeling dropped in, since Helen never seems convincing as a reader and lover of books. The cutesy quality of the plot and some of the language, along with Helen's self-obsession, end up giving the novel a claustrophobic feeling.
B000002IJA|3.0|As a soundtrack, this CD is unbelievably good. So if hearing music from an average movie over and over again could possibly do one of your favorite bands justice, run out or online to your local record store and feel proud. As a 9-track compilation of the metal masters, the set sounds less than out of luck. It seems what Young, Johnson, Mutt and the rest of the ACDC team won't consider is what most fans have wanted/expected for years - a Best Of that honors the band's truly greatest hits. Trying to convince dedicated fans Who Made Who, with only 5 (including the new then title track) of the 20+ classics, no longer cuts any Black. No need to get in a panic Angus, followers have already bought all the studio albums. At least give us a chance now to own a disc(s) the band has meant concert/recording business with over the decades. I'm convinced I'd pay whatever the price to celebrate a listing of your greatest rolling in my car player on yes even a Cowtown weekend. If fans must again settle to burn the best, so be it. At least that way T.N.T. for one can be reassured the true Voltage it deserves after all this time...
B000059XUP|2.0|The Crow is one of my favorite movies of all time. I loved Brandon Lee and if it wasn't for his tragic death during the making of movie, he would have become a superstar. I must have seen the Crow at least 30 times, however I always refused to see any of the sequels. I thought it somehow tramples on Lee's legacy. Also I thought the sequels would destroy the franchise much like Robocop. Very few sequels actually live up to the original. Well about a month ago I caught Crow Salvation on the Sci-fi channel and I was pleasantly surprised. Based on many positive reviews here on Amazon, I bought DVD. Very disappointed! Although I thought Mia Kirshner and Vincent Perez were good, the itself just didn't deliver. I thought sexually perverse villains were horrible. Although nobody compares with Michael Wincott, Richard Brooks has to be one of the worst actors ever. To make matters worse he provides audio commentary (along with others) on how he was able to play the Evil Judah. huh?? The guy has no acting talent. The absolute worst part was the ending, very disappointing resolution. Best part of the movie was Thomas Jane (THE PUNISHER) who plays a quite \\"masterful\\" role. I actually think Crow Salvation was better, probably because I didn't expect anything, but I actually expected this movie to be good.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|All I can say is WOW!  This is an awesome soundtrack!  The brass section catches your ear and draws you in for the entire time!  When I first listened to it, I couldn't stop!  I was transported into the time of adventures and pirates!  After it was over, I longed for more!  I adore the main themes of this score!  My favorite tracks include: Fog Bound, The Medallion Calls, Will and Elizabeth, Swords Crossed, Barbossa Is Hungry, One Last Shot, and He's A Pirate.  I truly love all of the tracks, though. The only  bad things I have to say aren't about the music.  First of all, it was WAY too short!  Then, whoever titled the pieces didn't know what he/she was doing!  The titles don't even go with the music!  Will and Elizabeth took place in the blacksmith shop.  Elizabeth wasn't even part of that scene!  One Last Shot took place Port Royal, not the pirate cave!  Don't get me wrong!  This is a treasure to have in your music collection!  It's a worthwhile buy!
1400049628|5.0|This book is insanely funny. I use the word insane because tell a person you are reading a zombie survival guide and look at the reaction you get. Most of the time I got these strangely fearful looks when people asked me what I was reading and I told them. This book was well worth all the looks I got while reading it. First and foremost, the book is extremely well written, the survival guide portion and the zombie attack sections of the book were both written as if they were cold hard facts, not made up from the author's imagination. You really could use this book in case of a zombie outbreak. Check the website  for the new movie &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;. There is a link to this site from the movie site. That in itself cracked me up again at remembering how funny the book was. I didn't know that the autor was the sunof Mel Brooks and a staff writer for SNL, but it doesn't surprise me. This book is well worth the cost, and anyone who reads it, either as a serious novel of just for laughs, will have a great time all the way though.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I just will say I saw &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; on a plane from the United States, and it may be the only time in my life I have enjoyed watching a film in flying. I think Japan must be a very interesting place. It has a good mix of old and modern and I can see it will be very hard for an out sider to understand. I have been through a very same experience in US, and even I could follow the language. <br />You might think it not believable that a 20 year old girl could be so close with an older man but I have seen it happen all the time. Even many I have seen get married. Both of the main stars in this film were very good. I was so happy to see it win the Oscars when I was in Sacramento. I think the woman director is very charming and very talented. In India we do not have enough of this quiet sort of film. Even the films we see from America are not like this. I wish I could see more such films.

B0001AP12G|5.0|When I first saw the name Kanye West it was when I realized that he was the one that produced Beanie Sigel's &quot;The Truth&quot;, which was a song from Beanie Sigel's solo CD.  I would see Kanye West's name once again on Jay Z's &quot;Dynasty: Roc La Familia&quot; CD.  Kanye produced a nice collaboration with Jay Z, Scarface and Beanie Sigel called &quot;This Can't Be Life&quot;.   He used an old Harold Melvin &amp; The Blue Notes song and all three rappers had nice verses on the song.   Other well known Kanye produced beats are also &quot;Get By&quot; by Talib Kweli, &quot;Takeover&quot; by Jay Z and &quot;Guess Who's Back&quot; which is another collaboration with Jay Z, Scarface and Beanie Sigel.   The first time I heard Kanye West rap was on &quot;Champions&quot; featuring Young Chris, Beanie Sigel, Cam'ron &amp; Twista from the Paid In Full soundtrack.   I wasn't sure if Kanye would release a CD but by the sounds of his debut CD, we definitely have a classic on our hands.<br />His first single, &quot;Through The Wire&quot; sampled the old Chaka Khan slow jam, &quot;Through The Fire&quot;.  Kanye detailed the near fatal car accident that he was in and he basically did the whole rap, &quot;through the wire&quot;.   &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; is an interesting collaboration between Kanye, Twista and Jamie Foxx.  Twista clearly steals the show but Kanye produces the track and he also has a nice verse on the song as well.  His current single, &quot;All Falls Down&quot; samples a song from Lauryn Hill's MTV Unplugged CD.  Lauryn wouldn't clear her vocals on the song so Kanye had Syleena Johnson sing the chorus.   Kanye has a clever way of rapping.  He likes to use metaphors, sometimes humorous, and you can tell that he is intelligent by the words that he says in some of his verses.<br />&quot;Jesus Walks&quot; is my favorite song on the CD.  Kanye talks about God in a way that no other rapper has before and Kanye plays off of the fact that if he wasn't the person that hewas that no one would even pay attention to what he is saying.  He is sending a message saying that there is nothing wrong with pubicly diplaying your love for Jesus Christ.  While the song may not be played in a club or on local radio stations, his message is loud and clear.   Jay Z accompanies Kanye West on &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;.  Jay has two &quot;fire&quot; verses inbetween Kanye and J Ivy.  This song also serves a motivational song as the chorus goes: &quot;When it comes to being true, atleast true to me, one thing I found, one thing I found is that you'll &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;.   &quot;Get 'Em High&quot; features Talib Kweli and Common and definitely contains the best lyrics on the CD.  We have an Erykah Badu less Common sounding like he did on &quot;I Used To Love Her&quot; and Talib at his best as well after Kanye raps to verses at the beginning of the track.   Other stand out tracks include &quot;Spaceship&quot; where Kanye takes you back to almost an oppressive way of how people came up in the world, &quot;We Don't Care&quot; where Kanye has his own version of a kid's national anthem, &quot;Two Words&quot; featuring Mos Def and Freeway where it's nice just to hear Mos Def rapping and not see him in a movie or a play and the hilarious &quot;New Workout Plan&quot; where Kanye claims to have the remedy for all of the ladies' problems.<br />I also can't exclude &quot;Family Business&quot; and &quot;Last Call&quot;.  Kanye plays off of habits in alot of families today like the aunt you don't eat food from and many other things.  On &quot;Last Call&quot; Kanye finishes &quot;The College Dropout&quot; right as he raps for about 5 minutes and he gives you a summary of how he came up in the producing and rapping game.<br />The only negative thing that I can say about this CD is that there are too many skits on &quot;The College Dropout&quot;. However, the skits don't mess up the flow of the whole CD like on some rappers' CDs.   Overall, you can't afford to miss what may be the best rap CD of 2004.   Kanye West has clearly outdone himself on this CD.  <br />James' Top 5<br />1) Jesus Walks<BR>2) Get 'Em High w/Talib Kweli &amp; Common<BR>3) Never Let Me Down w/Jay Z &amp; J Ivy<BR>4) Slow Jamz w/Twista &amp; Jamie Foxx<BR>Tie 5) We Don't Care &amp; Spaceship
B0000067X1|5.0|An Album so seemingly ahead of it's time, that its difficult to define it amongst today's contemporary music.  Devised in the early 70's it's largely electronic infused rock, spliced with early forms of synthesizers, it's as much avant garde as it is Rock &amp; roll.  Japanese singer Kenji &quot;Damo&quot; Suzuki is a unusual singer frontman, in that his vocal strain involves as much quiet murmuring as it is loud shrieking (almost all of it unintelligible), yet coupled with the quite literally (and I'm not overstating this) Visionary arrangements &amp; instrumentation, it manages to become one of the most significant albums ever released in the 70's.  And thereby touching upon `Electronic Rock', Dark Ambient, Art Rock, psychedelic Funk, or swamped in a truly captivating consistency,  that even 30 or so years on, it manages to shoot straight in and become easily one of the finest albums I've heard this year (and will easily remain in the top 5, before the years out).  Although caution is advised with this album, as it's resolutely leftfield &amp; non-conformist, and for every 5 people that it hypnotises with it's brilliance, there'll be someone that's convinced it's utter `pretension', If you regularly listen to albums that push boundaries &amp; are too challenging for mainstream or your friends just don't get....then buy this, It really highlights how utterly incredible music doesn't always find a larger audience.
B000001FHV|5.0|I love these guys.  It's super cool that they associated with Kurt Cobain, fore the Meat Puppets music is hip and worthy enough to be played alongside Nirvana's Unplugged.  That is beside the point.  This is my favorite album buy the MP's.
0451527046|4.0|Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson is an epic story about a mutinous gang of pirates and buried treasure. The classic story starts when a strange man walks in to the Admiral Benbow Inn. He tells a boy named Jim Hawkins a very important warning, to watch out for a seafaring man with one leg. So when Jim found one, he knew not to trust the one-legged man, Long John Silver. Even though I saw all the movies and knew what was going to happen I enjoyed Stevenson's details and the way he turned Jim Hawkins into a spy for his captain.
0385504209|1.0|Unfortunately I can't give this less than one star.<br />I am not going to review this as a novel. If you read this as a novel you may enjoy it, I can't speak to individual tastes.<br />This review is more for those of you who are in anyway duped by the author's claim to historical accuracy.<br />Simply put, this is unimaginatively rehashed anti-Christian propaganda from days of old. That it is presented as a novel is simply to make it easier to sell. It is seriously remiss in some of it's blatant misinterpretations and outright falsehoods. By way of example, the Council of Nicea did not deify Christ. One has only to look to St Peter's words &quot;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God&quot; in the Gospel of Matthew, St Paul's Letters &quot;God sending his own Son&quot;, &quot;the only begotten of the Father&quot; St John's Gospel, never mind the voice from the sky at the transfiguration &quot;This is my beloved Son&quot;, and so on, for it to be blindingly obvious from the earliest that Christ was revered as God made man.<br />To then say that 250 years later the early Church Fathers rewrote swathes of text to present Christ as divine is the cheapest way out of an argument ever. &quot;I make a claim that X is false.&quot; But the evidence disproves your claim. &quot;Then the evidence has been doctored.&quot; Please. I hearby claim that Dan Brown is a short tentacled alien from Venus and that any evidence to the contrary has been doctored by people who wish to present him as human.<br />This is tabloid history from the 'mud sticks' school of journalism that has no need of or regard for truth. It reminds me of one book claiming the Apollo moon landings had been faked that reinvented basic geometry to prove a point. Presumably they hoped the reader wouldn't notice.<br /><br />The same trickery is in evidence here, as a particularly simple example for non-Christians shows. For more on this I would direct you to an earlier reviewer's (Evergreen, CO) nice summary of existing collections of Da Vinci's artwork including not least an early sketch of the Last Supper where the artist has labelled the figures. Shock horror, yes that figure is John, who is always depicted as young and clean shaven and not Mary Magdelene. If Brown the 'historian' can mislead you on these details don't kid yourself about the depths he will sink to to make money. After all, his making money is his and his publisher's main motive. Truth? Truth doesn't pay for his house.<br />Ask yourself, why wouldn't Peter or Paul or James or any of the Gospel writers talk about Jesus being married, particularly Paul when defending his own right to have a wife (1 Corinthians)? Were they running a conspiracy whose nefarious aims were to ask people to love God and each other?! Oh no, that's right, their texts were doctored by short tentacled Venusians to hide the truth about the Moon landings.<br />Spend your money more wisely and get some texts on logical poofs and fallacies so you can spot this sort of trash earlier next time.f existing collections of Da Vinci's artwork including not least an early sketch of the Last Supper where the artist has labelled the figures.

0385504209|5.0|This book should be included on the top one hundred books ever written.  I feel as if I've just completed a thrilling college course, and wouldn't be at all surprised if the study of this book wasn't eventually offered as one.  It covers a little bit of everything from history, math, logic, science, religion, astronomy, art, and architecture.  Back when I was in High School, I had heard about the universal code of Nature (1.618 PHI.) in a science class , but it was never presented in such a way before that made it interesting enough for me to really sit down and think about it.  After reading this book I was doing little experiments to verify that it was true.  Oh, by the way in addition to being a very good college text, this book was also a very good murder mystery involving a treasure hunt in search of the Holy Grail.  The questions remain however, \\"What is the Holy Grail or San Greal?\\"  \\"Is it a chalice, a women, a royal blood line, or a bunch of hidden documents?\\"<br />The book quotes the following from Leonardo Da Vinci that it says is in reference to the Bible, \\"Blinding ignorance does mislead us.  O! Wretched mortals, open your eyes!\\"  The line refers to people blindly reading the Bible without questioning the truth in the message.  I would like to caution people not to make the same mistake here by blindly reading this book and accepting everything said here without looking things up for themselves to see how much of it is based on facts, and how much on innuendo.  Some of course is just based on innuendo for the story line, but I was amazed by how much is actually based on real facts (especially the art work, and symbols).  Leonardo obviously had a hidden agenda with some of his paintings, but what that message was is still open to interpretation.  (It does look like there really was a women sitting at the table in his \\"Last Supper\\" painting to the right of Jesus.  Whether this person is supposed to be Mary Magdalene however is open to discussion.  This painting of course is Da Vinci's interpretation of that scene rather than based on anything that actually happened.)<br />I love a book that makes you think and go out and learn something new and this book by Dan Brown does that.  It reminded me a little of Michael Crichton's books like Jurassic Park or Congo, that take some real facts then ask what if, and lay out a believable story that leaves you scratching your head at the end wondering what is real.<br />Is the Catholic Church built on lies, and if so does it matter, or do we even care?  As a Catholic I remember being concerned years ago when I found out that Jesus might not have actually been born on December 25th, but that the Church choose this day to celebrate it since it coincided with other Pagan god's birthdays.  I wondered how many other things were done while setting themselves up to try to eliminate the competition, and this book just opened up a whole bunch of additional questions that I will now have to research and decide for myself on what is real.<br />The basic teachings of the church are still the same and have a good message.  That hasn't changed.  Even before reading this book however I have felt like something was missing from the church or needs to be changed.  Maybe by reading this book it will help point me in the right direction as to what I am looking for.<br />On a side note I saw that Nicholas Flamel the alchemist was listed as one of the previous Grand Masters of the Priory of Sion.  Nicholas is mentioned in \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\", but I hadn't noticed until this book that he was a real person when I looked him up on line. ...painting of course is Da Vinci's interpretation of that scene rather than based on anything that actually happened.)<br />I love a book that makes you think and go out and learn something new and this book by Dan Brown does that.

B00009V7ON|3.0|When I first saw the first half of the trailer to Cast Away, my mind was immediately excited. One guy tries to survive on an island with nothing but what washes up on shore from a plane crash. Sounded like my kind of thing. But then the second half of the preview let audience know that the guy gets rescued and survives. That's a pretty big spoiler to put in the trailer. Imagine the preview to Empire Strikes Back revealing the identity of Darth Vader, the trailer to Citizen Kane revealing what Rosebud is, the DVD cover of Planet of the Apes revealing... wait. They did that. Anyway, it is a misstep to place Cast Away on par with those movies. It's entertaining and nothing more. And the whole movie appears to have been financed by FedEx.
6305736650|5.0|From 1939 through 1941, many Europeans were wondering what ... was taking America so long to join the fight against Hitler. Keeping in mind that Rick Blaine(Bogart) is an American who refuses to get involved in other people's affairs, even with life and death on the line, CASABLANCA can easily be interpreted as a criticism of America's callous indifference to the horrors going on across the ocean. The film makers had acknowledged this as a catalyst for making this movie. And on that level, CASABLANCA is an enormous success.<br />But films rarely make it on just their political or social messages. What makes CASABLANCA the classic it is, is the incredible balance of top-notch acting, impeccable writing, and flawless pacing by the director. As one previous reviewer mentioned, the military intrigues and dangers are heightened by the tensions of the love story. Rick's love for Ilsa (part nostalgia, part real) is what finally gets him involved, but given his previous associations with all levels of Casablanca's society, he must be careful where this love leads him. This movie is a thriller and a sentimental love story, neither of which is overblown or corny. Bogey, Bergman, Jordan, Lorre all turn in performances which will be remembered for so long as films are shown.<br />Lastly, the serious nature of the plot finds relief in several moments of humor. As a New Yorker, this is my favorite bit of repartee:<br />Major Strasser (To Rick): Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?<BR>Rick: It's not particularly my beloved Paris.<BR>Heinz: Can you imagine us in London?<BR>Rick: When you get there, ask me!<BR>Major Strasser: How about New York?<BR>Rick: Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.<br />What a wonderful film!
1400049628|5.0|When the dead rise and walk the earth to feast upon the flesh of the living, all those gun-control advocates are going to feel pretty silly. <br />This highly amusing volume is, primarily, a spoof of survivialist manuals, and simultaneously is one of the best and most thorough summaries of zombie-fiction conventions I've ever read. There is a lot going on in this book all at once, and it is surprisingly fun to try to disentangle the threads of just what Max Brooks is spoofing at any given moment.  Sure, the book is a goof on survivalist literature, and on the zombie genre, but the completely deadpan presentation (and the fact that the author has clearly thought about both subjects WAY too much) belies a certain respect for both.  Is he sending up those of us who stocked up on toilet paper and bottled water prior to Y2K (or bought sheets of plastic and duct tape, all the better to suffocate ourselves to death in hermetically sealed interior rooms in the event of an anthrax attack after 9/11)?  Is he laughing at zombie-film fanatics who can categorize monsters by their film antecedents like the CDC tracking the progress of a mutating influenza strain?  Or laughing with them?  Is he laughing at you, for having bought his book (for whatever your motives)?<br />I highly recommend this book for horror or zombie film fans. And if you've got a crazy uncle who has been stockpiling ammo out at his ranch (complete with independent water source) against the day when &quot;they&quot; come, get a copy for him, too - even if he doesn't appreciate the humor, he might get some useful ideas for defending the homestead come the revolution.
0962477060|4.0|Most music is taught from a piano mentality... a long string of notes stretching from too low to sing to too high to sing. Edwards maps out music on the guitar the way notes are found on it, by strings, shapes, and relationships. His method allows you to move from tons of rote memorization to knowing a few things which apply to the whole fretboard. <br />You'll learn the elementary chord shapes which will allow you to play any major chord in at least five different voicings. You'll be able to take what you already know and translate it into what you need. (How do you play an E flat minor?). <br />You'll also learn the five pentatonic scale shapes and to see the relationship between them. <br />In the second half of the book, he takes the fundamentals and translates them into making music in various styles.
B000003S09|5.0|This is by far, the best, and only album that I recommend by this band. The first and last tracks, 21st Century Schizoid Man and Court of the Crimson King are absolute classics that hark back to the seventies. The heavy Mellotron and Greg Lake's voice add an atmosphere that is unique and exciting. I never liked the band after this album. Even the artwork on the album cover is classic. This work stands out in the field of jazz rock and I highly recommend it.
B00013PHGS|4.0|Air's 10,000 Hz Legend was such a disaster that any subsequent release would be better.  Talkie Walkie is not only a relief, but, in many aspects, a superior recording to their lovely Moon Safari.  That's recording, not record.  They've always had a facility in the studio, but Talkie Walkie is their finest produced work - a gorgeous display of sonic panache that's equal parts ambiance and composition.  The standouts here are instrumental - the banjo-crazy \\"Alpha Beta Gaga\\", the lilting \\"Alone in Kyoto\\" (from the soundtrack of Lost in Translation) - with runners-up props going to the space-y \\"Venus\\" and first single \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\".  Jean-Benoit Dunckel and Nicolas Godin still basically make mood music, but their disposition is more eclectic, more purely entertaining these days.

0743243307|1.0|I loved the idea of this book and was very open to it being as good as the hype, but it's not. To start with, the characters are too black and white, and not well drawn. Some characters don't even have names, they're a category: \\"The Questioner\\" and so forth. The characters that do have names are given characteristics much more that features. Chanu, the husband, is a pompous gasbag in the way that only the men of patriarchal cultures can be. He is a castles-in-the-air-type of person, and we read over and over about the selfish things he does, how he lords over and oppresses his wife and two daughers, how fat and revolting he is physically. His wife, Nazneen, married off by her father is virtuous, thoughtful, pious and not only runs the household, but ends up supporting her family with sewing piece-work. This book is LOOOOOOOONGGG, at least a hundred pages too long, and not in the good way. It's long in the way that has you skimming over pages, especially the ones about the Muslim group forming, losing your place and not caring, and basically just trying to get through it. After all that work, the denoument doesn't satisfy -- one can't believe that characters that have been shown to act one way (over and over and over) would suddenly start acting otherwise so the book could have the endig it did. Skip it.
0930289331|5.0|I recently read \\"Year One\\" in one sitting. After about page 11 or 12, I just couldn't stop! The story synopsis can be known through other reviews, so I'll just contribute my own reactions.<br />I've rarely been this engrossed in a graphic novel/comic series. Due to its length, \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" seems a little more daunting to bite into, so the simplicity and brisk length of Batman's beginnings in \\"Year One\\" make it very attractive and accessible to the first-time seeker of Frank Miller's brilliant and important work on Batman. The story and art really plays out like a neo-noir film, complete with dates (i.e. \\"January 4;\\" think of the film, \\"Seven\\") that give you a sense of where Batman and the \\"scene stealer,\\" Lt. Gordon, are in the progression of the first year of both characters' careers as Gotham's new \\"hope.\\" The other brilliant aspect of this story is that the villains aren't super-villains; I don't want to give anymore than that away.<br />What really attracted me to \\"catching up\\" on \\"Year One,\\" more than anything else, is the fact that I grew up with quite an obsession with Burton's films and highly anticipate Christopher Nolan's upcoming \\"Batman Begins.\\" What I found out is that, although Burton's filmic treatments are admirable, it's not quite as faithful to Miller's most-definitive work as it should be. However, I was watching Nolan's first film, \\"Following,\\" recently and noticed that, on one of the doors of a flat in the movie, there was a Batman logo sticker! First and foremost, \\"Following\\" is a stylish and intelligent neo-noir thriller that I highly recommend, but the film was released in 1999; four years before Nolan became involved with the new Batman project! This confirms that, not only is he the perfect young director for the Batman that Miller gave us, but he is also a true and caring \\"Bat-fan!\\"<br />In concluding, I kept Nolan's films and directing style in mind while reading \\"Year One,\\" and 1) this may prompt you to \\"bone up\\" on the material that \\"Batman Begins\\" is inspired by and 2) thoroughly informs you that Batman is the most intriquing of all comic characters and deserves a faithful filmic treatment that can inform the rest of the world who Batman really is!
0786880708|5.0|Mindfulness should be an exercise all beings participate in practicing, not simply exclusive to our Buddhist traditions; a point Kabat-Zinn makes in this wonderful book. What it truly encompasses is a kind of awakening (yes, clich&eacute;) where we begin living in accord with not just all people but, also with ourselves.<br />Jon Kabat-Zinn is the director of the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, a clinic which likely has helped innumerable beings. Mindful meditation is a letting go practice, a practice of non contriving and ultimately - endurance. It is an acknowledgement of who we already are, beneath the layers of attachments and aversion; that is of course that we are loving and generous people.<br />This book offers a plethora of meditative exercises and mindfulness applications to employ in our daily routines. Zinn suggests utilizing sitting, walking, and even \\"on your feet\\" meditation. Metaphors of mindful actions are here using topics like parenting or even washing the dishes. This work will hopefully motivate all who read it. Great book.
0452283760|5.0|A beautiful story of extremes - in Howard Roark we see the greatness of complete independence; in Elsworth Toohey we see a dependent striving to be great. The contrast of these two figures is not fully revealed until the last hundred or so pages, but it is startling and, when looking back, always present. First, the dependent - a man who relies on others for his survival. Rand shows us that the great dictators of the past are these people - the ones who have no power unles they control others; destroy them and rule them. Yes, it's power - but it is still dependency. The people under Toohey - Peter Keating, his authors and playwrights and architects - all broken and relying on this man's tyrany. Toohey boosts the mediocre so that &quot;greatness&quot; can be achieved by anyone. He discourages people from taking a course that they would be good at and that would make them happy, all to eliminate the chance that anything truly great could exist. In one sad scene he even tells poor Peter this, and Peter, at the end of the confession, still clings to Toohey, because he has nothing else left. <br />Second, the independent. Roark has no concern for others because he expects to be scorned. Far from hating man-kind, he loves by making them cope with the truth - letting them see what they could be and allowing them to heal themselves. He can only respect those that have respect for themselves. The only way to live is to be completely selfish - unwilling to give up integrity, truth, courage, kindness, greatness. People lose themselves briefly in the blinding truth embodied by Roark - and then heal, become better people because he looked upon them.<br />The Fountainhead is a stunning examination of the power of the independent, written in such a way that a single character can become that term and another its opposite. Too often we hear that worthiness is defined by &quot;selfless acts&quot; with egoism being the true evil. Rand argues that the center of selfishness depends onwhat you're speaking of - selflessly giving away your integrity is suddenly not such a selfless act. Told within the context of architecture, the story gains scale. What does the audience see of Roark's buildings - his modern masterpieces - and what do they see of the filth (excuse me - the things everyone else build) that quickly fill the skylines? Roark respects all aspects of designing and building - enough to insist it be done his way, with complete integrity as he knows few others are capable of. <br />I found this book to be beautiful and sad - a startling model of two disceptively similar roles blown completely out of proportion. If you find Roark to be emotionless than you did not read correctly, for he cares about many things, and if you blindly believe my words you have missed the point. We may never be able to reach Roark's independence, if ever we want to, but it never hurts to know what a purely selfish and undeniably great person can do.

Consulting the amazing Randi isn't such a bad idea...skepticism first-daydreaming later.

0440180295|5.0|When the movie based on the book was presented in Italian cinemas, I was in my pre-teens and, being  it rated NC-14, all I was allowed to look at was its trailer. Even it, alone, left me a strange impression, as a result of an usual mix of war, science fiction and sex (very few, however, but then considered enough for rating). The book has been a full confirmation of that boyhood memory: strict language, dark humour, plenty of references (The Execution of Private Slovik is an interesting historical note), an underlying structure uncorrelated events are attached over, build up an environment logical and confused at the same time. All books by Vonnegut I have read so far are someway related to previous references or boyhood memories, so I sensed a hint of completion of old knowledge by their reading. So considering him as the best author in science fiction may be an exaggeration, but I am glad I have read this book now: I think I could have not appreciated the random jumps in the thread when I was used to the \\"fairy tale\\" SF.
0783225849|3.0|We meet a young woman, Marion Crane, who seems to hold a rather common office job. Aside from complaints of a headache, everything about her seems normal. Or, does it? A big-name client comes in. He's ready to make a major purchase, which he'll pay for in cash. Marion's ready to leave for the weekend, so she's given the assignment of taking this large sum to the bank. However, she has deeper intentions on her mind when she leaves town with the money, an act that sets the rest of Psycho in motion.<BR>While the plot was a creative one, it still had its weak spots. Much of the events could be predicted before they occurred, though I still wanted to find out what happened next. For example, I knew Marion would do something with the money, though I wanted to find out where her getaway would lead her. When her journey took her to a mysterious motel, and to the likes of the odd Norman Bates, telltale signs were everywhere that something wicked was just around the corner. In the film's suspenseful scenes, I could sense something was going to happen, yet I still jumped out of my seat when it did. Except for the final scene - which I found added well to Bates' disturbing manner - Psycho's ending left much to be desired. I knew the main twist far before the conflict was resolved, and the remaining characters over-explained the puzzle's solution.<BR>Psycho's best aspects shine through in its scares, suspense, and music. In the death scenes, the music quiets to a complete stop as the camera pans in on the victim. The feeling is high that danger is near. When it finally does arrive, after moments of anticipation, it seems to emerge out of nowhere and can stun even the most relaxed viewers. This suspense plays out well through the movie, and not just in the climactic scenes. When Marion comes upon Norman, you crave to know where their interactions will lead. The same goes for other characters who step upon the Bates Hotel, such as the investigator Milton Arbogast, Marion's boyfriend Sam Loomis, and Marion's sister Lila. An element that fits in well with the mood is Psycho's music. It halts before action occurs, like an \\"eye of the storm\\" effect, then suddenly pipes up to increase the frightening event. At the crucial points, it increases in volume and speed, a perfect audio complement for a rapidly beating heart.<BR>Hitchcock's favorite themes add well to the film's effects. There are two occurrences when Marion comes across a suspicious looking police officer. As this officer interrogates and watches her, whether or not she will be allowed to move on is a question that comes to mind. The biggest theme that's intertwined through the movie would be madness, seen both in Norman and his invalid mother. While the mother tends to become a raging lunatic, Norman's insanity shows through in a more subtle way. When he has his quaint dinner chat with Marion, the unhealthy bond with his mother reveals itself as he defends her to no end against Marion's critical tone. Two of the themes help to add to Norman's disturbed character. First, we find out he likes to stuff birds in his spare time, surely an odd habit for such a man. Second, there's a point in the movie in which he spies on Marion through a peephole and a close-up is given of his eye. This scene dramatically increases the creep factor.<BR>Psycho is a suitable all-around thriller. Unlike today's gore-infested horror movies, there are only two or three instances when things get nasty looking. The squeamish viewer can watch this Hitchcock film without much trouble. While gore-loving horror aficionados may find it rather plain, this is a perfect horror flick for a more mainstream audience. Being a close follower of typical thriller elements, it would also be ideal for a newcomer who's just learning the world of horror films.
B00005TT77|5.0|This is a very nice cd.  It has some great remakes of Beatles songs.  If you are a beatles fan, you will enjoy it.  It has some artists we have all heard of and some that we dont all know, but is very enjoyable! If you haven't seen the movie, you should check it out too.
B00011V8CW|5.0|This is some great music by a great performer. This is an overlooked gem that really needs to be rediscovered. The music is perfect for driving music and it's very relaxing. Fully of great Jazzy hooks, while blistering out great rock music while adding a touch of techno to it, this makes an enjoyabe album for almost anyone. <BR>Bowie fans and non-Bowie fans, try this album! You won't be disappointed!!
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Finally!!! A modern rock band had the BALLS to break the cookie cutter sound that modern bands seem to have now days. What the heck do I mean you say? There are actually solos in some of these tunes!!! Pretty good ones too, although any 80's guitarist would still yawn.(They all could shred and most still do!!) It is a very refreshing sound that adds some color to the otherwise same-sounding songs. I read that the band set out to make this record with something in mind. They realized how modern bands now are very hard to tell one from another. They felt like they needed to distance themselves from the pack. Well I am happy to say that Godsmack is no longer a &quot;Faceless&quot; band.

B00018D3RI|5.0|When does season 2 come out?! This DVD has a great interview on disc 5.  (Would like to have seen outtakes.) The packaging is awesome. I learned a lot from that show:  If you're on the side of right, you have nothing to fear, be honest with yourself and others, and use your turn signals! I know now they didn't like the car, but I always will.  I saw one in Atlanta in 1979 at a restaurant and just KNEW they were there.  ha ha. I still want one today. Its funny, but when I first saw S&amp;H, I told my mom, &quot;Hey, that's the guy from Fiddler on the Roof.&quot;  :)
0783225849|4.0|Thrilling, suspenseful, and stimulating are only a few of the words you can say to describe the film \\"Psycho.\\" Alfred Hitchcock directs this mind boggling movie in a way that no other director could. This movie follows some of Hitchcock's other great classics such as \\"Rear Window,\\" and \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" which make them look as if they were Hitchcock's beginning movies.<BR> Instead of using a large budget and Technicolor, Hitchcock decided to take a different approach with this movie. He wanted the movie to be filmed in black and white even though color movies had been out for some time now. At first I thought that because the movie was in black and white that it would be uninspiring and dull but it actually made the picture better. Having it be filmed that way makes the movie scarier. It is always dark and gloomy so it puts you in that mood where you are ready to be frightened.  Hitchcock also did this movie on a very low budget with only $800,000 dollars to spend. With the little amount of money he had he did a wonderful job with all of the camera shots and angles that it looks like he spent tons of money and quality time while making \\"Psycho.\\"<BR> The movie starts out with Marian Crane played by Janet Leigh and Sam Loomis played by John Gavin in a cheap motel on their lunch break talking about how they want to be together but they can't  for money reasons. Marian is able to steal money from her job and drives off to surprise her lover. She stops at a motel one night while on her way but because it was getting late she decided to stop and this is where the real story begins. You think that you are watching a movie about one thing and the next minute the plot of the movie changes before your eye. The whole time that you are watching the movie you are always unsure of what is going to happen and it keeps you guessing right up to the very end unlike some of the movies that are out now. <BR> You would think that since this movie was made in 1959 that it wouldnot be the least bit scary but it turns out to be one of the scariest movies of all time. What makes the movie so scary is the music. The music in this movie is absolutely astonishing. There is music playing throughout most of the movie and the way they placed the music in each scene makes the movie that much better. Right when something is going to happen the music gets a little louder or it suddenly changes. Suspense is also another factor that makes this movie chilling. You never know exactly when something bad is going to happen or if someone is going to attack so you are left gripping on to your seat until something unusual happens. <BR> Another great feature about \\"Psycho\\" is the acting. All of the actors in the movie do a really great job portraying who they are playing.  None of them every look like they are acting. They make it look so real and that is one of the supreme effects of this movie. You feel like you are watching a documentary on a murderer who is being taped and you <BR>Just want them to stop.  <BR> \\"Psycho\\" is a movie that I went into a little bit hesitant but after seeing it I truly do believe that this movie is brilliant. This movie is for people who like suspense and love to be scared. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is sick and tired of seeing all the new horror films out that make you yawn. This movie is exciting, suspenseful and makes you want to go out and see all of the other films that Hitchcock directed.
B000021XS0|5.0|Yes, it's the band people love to hate, Dream Theater. There's just something about this band that rubs certain Type A's the wrong way... They are just SO DAMN GOOD.<br />This CD is the long awaited sequel to &quot;Images And Words&quot; recorded around 1992. It's a Rock Opera more or less. But for the people who have criticized every effort Savatage has made to record a Rock Opera, remember, it's not an attempt to remake the magic of The Who's &quot;Tommy&quot;.<br />The album is an individual. Buy it because you like Dream Theater, not because you want a new &quot;Tommy&quot; to spin.
B0000214F0|3.0|I wish I liked Caligula. It could have been so much: with talented actors, beautiful extras, a no-holds-barred approach shared by an intellectual screenwriter and an uninhibited director, it sounds like a blueprint for an brutally honest and emotionally strenuous film. And maybe it was at the time, but as one of the millions of movie viewers who don't remember the 70's, who never had limits on the amount of sex and violence presented as entertainment (except, for better or worse, our parents), Caligula is not very shocking at all. It's terrible to admit being desensitized, but anyone who has ever watched both a porn movie and a single episode of any network cop drama can handle this.  <br />It is important to watch the \\"Making of Caligula\\" feature with the DVD, as it explains everything that went into making the film. In many ways, this short film is more interesting than the movie itself. It's kind of sad, really, to see how Gore Vidal thought the movie would change the history of cinema and how much research and effort and money went into creating a Rome that ultimately looks like a porno movie but acts like a morality epic. If anything, it's evidence of the efforts in the 1970's to bring porn into mainstream cinema, of the time right before AIDS was discovered. It belongs on a shelf next to \\"Deep Throat.\\" <br />Caligula is a reasonably good movie about how excess brings the death of morality. But so many other movies have been made which better explore this theme in equally provocative ways. ...

0783225849|3.0|Known best for its shower scene, Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock is a horror classic.  Most modern day horror films try to grasp the element of suspense that Hitchcock is able to portray, but few live up to this standard; other films often shock us only for a few seconds, illustrating surprise but never reaching that level of suspense. <BR> Psycho tells the story of confusion, crime, and murder. Marion Crane (portrayed by Janet Leigh) is a young attractive woman who steals from a wealthy client. She looks at the money as a way to secure her future with her divorced boyfriend, Sam, who is unable to marry because he must make large alimony payments to his ex-wife.  On the way to visit her boyfriend, Marion stops at the Bates Motel on the side of an old highway. She meets the owner, Norman Bates, (played by Anthony Perkins) who is obviously attracted to Marion. They talk with each other openly about their lives, but Marion is murdered in the shower minutes later. <BR>When Lila Crane (played by Vera Miles) realizes her sister is missing she begins to search for Marion, and is followed by a private investigator, Mr. Arbogast. Arbogast develops a lead and tries to track Marion down at the Bates Motel. He makes an effort to learn more about Norman, and consequently becomes the next victim. Lila and Sam take matters into their own hands and just when they think they have the case figured out; Hitchcock delivers a major twist.<BR>Alfred Hitchcock is also well known for his brilliant camera angles and unique filming techniques. He brings this black and white picture to life by using surprising perspectives. After talking with Norman in the parlor, Marion leaves to take a shower. We see her undress through the eyes of Norman as the camera peers through a hole in his parlor. Next, unexpectedly, the audience sees an extreme close up of Norman's eye staring into the next room. A further example is the next scene.  The camera closes in on water spiraling down the drain, then fades to an opposite spiral of the eye of the recently murdered Marion. Throughout the movie the characters constantly watch one another which lets the audience see different perspectives.<BR>Hitchcock forces the audience to sympathize with a psychotic killer by reeling us in during the conversation he has with Marion. We feel compassion for someone who has been suppressed his entire life. He was forced to take over ownership of the motel, and never had much contact with anyone except for his overpowering mother. He is unable to escape her control, and her beliefs have been forced on her son, who struggles to balance his opinions and those of his mother.  We wouldn't want to be put in this position ourselves, so we are compelled to empathize with this character. Even as the car hiding Marion's corpse is sinking into the swamp, we hope it will be submerged so Norman will not get caught. Although I did not enjoy Norman as a character, Perkins did a wonderful job of convincing the audience of the lunatic he played.<BR>Psycho is a must see for all, including those who do not particularly enjoy horror. The film showcases great acting, filming, and directing.  Hitchcock added all the right ingredients to create a masterpiece. The film was purposely shot on a very low budget to showcase Hitchcock's filming techniques. The absence of special effects allows the audience to focus on the actors doing their best work.  The simplicity of the set and the black and white film lends itself to suspense and drama. Psycho has been the subject of many film studies, and for good reason. As I watched the film, I knew I would find more detail if I were to see it again. The black and white may discourage some, but I believe it added an element of style that the movie would have otherwise been unable to capture.
B00006LI26|4.0|A pretty good power metal album. Only 1 criticism: whilst Kai Hansen is an excellent guitar player, he is not the best singer in the world; the other singers of Helloween have been sooo much better. But the guitars and drums still kick @$$ on this CD, and I would recommend this to any Iron Maiden fan.
0783225849|4.0|Many people say Alfred Hitchcock is a mastermind when it comes to directing.  I was never much of a believer of that until I saw the movie Psycho.  The thought of a movie made in the 1960's was a huge turn off.  What could be good about a movie made so long ago?  There would not be any amazing special effects that movies had now a days.<br /> The assumptions I made about this movie were drastically off the charts.  Psycho would easily be considered first-rate in my book. The plot is exceptional.  You will never know what hit you as you watch this movie.<br /> The story starts out with two characters in a secluded hotel room.  Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh) is a gorgeous blond with immense sex appeal and her handsome lover Sam Loomis (played by John Gavin) are getting ready to leave the hotel to resume their daily lives.  Marion arrived at work after her lunch break.  She was then given a job to take $40,000 to the bank.  The $40,000 belonged to a tasteless man named Tom Cassidy.<br /> Marion leaves with the money, but instead of taking it to the bank she skips town to be with Sam.  On the drive she runs into a few problems: there was a nosey cop who seemed to be following her and then it began to downpour.  She stopped at a local motel.  When she stepped into the lobby of the Bates Motel Norman Bates (played by Anthony Perkins) assigned her a room.  They talked in the parlor, and that is where the twists of the plot began.<br />  The imagery in this movie is excellent.  Hitchcock brilliantly uses the eye as a focus point in many scenes.  In the parlor scene, there are many stuffed birds that seem to have their eyes focused on Marion and Norman.  Norman's eye as he watches Marion in her hotel room gives the scene a creepy feeling as the eye seems to be bulging out of the socket. Imagery is often used as an extra aspect of a movie, but this movie would not be the same without its images.<br />The angle's Hitchcock chose to set the camera during the scenes gives them a dramatic and chilling feature that most people would enjoy in a horror film.  Scenes such as when the water from the shower is swirling down the drain and the camera moves in closer and closer or how the camera angles focus in on the eyes of the characters makes the movie a classic in many peoples hearts.<br /> The element of suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the movie.  Films that are made now days have great special effects, but the element of suspense is slowly starting to die.  New directors seem to think that the element of surprise makes a better movie.  I think that the movie Psycho proves that to be wrong.<br /> The movie is filmed in black and white and this element seems to really give the movie an extra edge.  The shadowing that is able to be done in this version of the movie instead of the version that was just recently remade in color gives it a spooky and tantalizing feel.  Shadowing seems to be a very important aspect in the roll of suspense and excitement.<br /> Psycho is a brilliantly directed film that is a true classic horror film in my opinion.  When most people think of a movie in the genre of horror they think of a gory film with lots of blood and killing.  That is what most horror films of today seemed to be based around, but that is not truly what makes a horror film.  The element of suspense is what makes a horror film.  Psychos plot twists, amazing acting, and use of camera angles seem to give it a boost that will knock a person's socks off.a dramatic and chilling feature that most people would enjoy in a horror film.

B000002H33|5.0|I can't imagine anyone not being familiar with this album, but for those of you that aren't or are just getting into Metallica or heavy music, this is the standard by which all metal albums should be held.  From the opening passages of Battery, through the onslaught of Disposable Heroes and the final bursts of Damage Inc., James, Lars, Kirk, and the late Cliff Burton proved that they truly were the Masters of Metal.  Few albums are able to combine such elements as lyrical imagery, brute force, and technical proficiency as Master of Puppets.  A true METALLIC MASTERPIECE!
034537410X|5.0|This is THE book on lucid dreaming. It is a manual of how to lucid dream containing every main technique with clear instructions including a detailed description of the technique that the author used to learn to become lucid in his dreams at will. It is also filled with descriptions of the lucid dreaming experiences of many other people. Dr. Laberge is a rigorous scientist and you will not find any irresponsible conclusions about the the topic or pseudo-science. <br />After becoming interested in lucid dreaming, I scoured the net and read everything about the topic that I could find, but after 6 months I had no success. However this is the book that got me going in the right direction and now I am having lucid dreams regularly. <br />If you get one book on lucid dreaming, this is the one. His earlier book, called Lucid Dreaming, is also very good if you want a more detailed description of the history of lucid dreaming or discussion and philosophy of lucid dreaming. In short, the book 'Lucid Dreaming' provides lots of background and 'Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming' is the \\"How to\\" manual.

B0001AP12G|2.0|Kanye is a talented young man being that I recognized a lot of his work as a producer but when it comes to emceeing something is just not quite right. The ONLY tracks I felt was \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"Through the Wire\\"...can't even give him credit for the Lauryn Hill flipped track \\"All Falls Down\\"...sorry Lauryn's better than him on that track too (Listen to \\"Mystery Of Iniquity\\"). Even when I listened to his lyrics, I just cound NOT feel him, plus his voice is annoying. He doesn't grab me like Rakim, De La, Com, Mos, Face, Del, Jay, Nas, E-40, Black Thought or any of these emcees do. I just ain't feeling him...plus to hear ol' skool joints get sped up and abused was painful to my ears and just summed it up for me: Lack Of Creativity.  Not that I don't like folks that sample, but his style of sampling is tiresome, uninspiring and overall I don't enjoy it... Put it like this producer 9th Wonder enlightens me 10 times more than Kanye. I feel he's overrated and sooner or later folks will come to realize that this album was over exaggerated and over hyped to be something so ill when really it was wack from jump street. Don't waste ya time kids, wait for The Roots to release their album in April, let them show you how hip hop is done. This album was a huge disappointment now I'm left trading it back to get about half of my money back... Kanye, stick to producing man and formulate a joint without sampling all the damn time...
B00006AUIG|4.0|The Danvers Mental Hospital is a REAL, honest-to-goodness asylum in Massachusetts that pioneered and perfected the frontal lobotomy. Built in the 1850's and closed in the mid-1980's due to lack of state funding, this movie is filmed entirely(camcorder style)in the once crowded (with over 2500 patients) & still to this day, horribly sinister asylum. I must say, that the undisputed STAR OF THIS FILM is the ASYLUM, itself. The cast does a better than average job in delivering real characters, however...<br />A group of Hazmat workers are hired to accomplish the task of asbestos removal in the gargantuan hospital. Gordon, the crew boss, promises that the job will be finished in 7 days.  Each crew member will receive 10 LARGE as a bonus once they meet the deadline, which, no matter how many eerie, odd & unexplained things start to happen in the asylum and to the workers, the promise of the money keeps them all to their appointed task.<br />This movie is filmed very effectively a la Stanley Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\" style.  That is to say, each day of the week is stated, a shot of the asylum is shown & then the day is filmed.  This is a frequently used tactic that screenwriters/directors use to build a sense of foreboding, and BOY, DOES IT EVER WORK in this film. Great cinematography & a really frighteningly strange musical score help to build the sense of inducing madness that this film makes you feel. It also has borrowings of \\"The Sixth Sense\\" inasmuch, clues are given throughout the film so that you may figure out for yourself, (if you are paying close attention) what oddities and malevolent forces are at work in the asylum & in the plot.  You will experience what REALLY \\"Lives in the Weak and Wounded...\\"  I guarantee it!<br />If you liked the plot twists in Sixth Sense, the madness of The Shining, or the otherworldly spirits that inhabited Stir Of Echos,  you will enjoy Session 9!
0783225849|5.0|I thought the movie Psycho, by Alfred Hitchcock was very good.  Compared to other horror films of today, his tended to focus on a main point instead of just getting caught up in all the killing and blood.  Furthermore, the music that he threw into the movie was a spot on the match.  He could not have portrayed the characters any better, or their acting..  I will definately view this movie again and recommend this movie to anyone.

B00005JKYI|5.0|I grew up in a rural, religous community on the edge of the Appalachia.  We were not allowed to dance.  It didn't strick me at all odd at the time, and it doesn't now, that a town council could make dances illegal or that the local pastor could almost single handedly control the town council.  And yes, a small town police officer could, without getting into any legal trouble, in that part of the world in the 1980s confiscate a rock and roll cassette tape (Remember those things?) for being played too loudly or simply because he didn't like the attitude of the driver.<br />Having said that, the movie is extremely dated and so some parts of it look and sound a little silly today.  Just like today's hip teen movies will look and sound silly two decades from now.  But I still like this movie.  Probably because some of these seens could be right out of my life.  I too went to church and looked at girls acrossed the aisle.  And after church we really did ride around in cars and pickups and hang out on family farms on Sunday afternoons doing really stupid teenage stuff with farm equipment.  All of these seens are caught pretty realisticly and are done very sympatheticly.  People with simple value systems are not mocked here, as they so often are in Hollywood. And the story line isn't all silly.  The pastor character is especially well written and well played.  And I should point out that girls really did wear their hair like that back then and really did wear tight sweaters and even tighter designer jeans.  Youngsters now days don't know what they are missing.  Buy this movie and watch Ariel move around the screen and you'll see what I mean.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho Gets Thumbs Up<BR> Alfred Hitchcock's low budget movie, Psycho, was only made on an $800,000 budget yet it became one of the most influential slasher films of all time. I would say it is the father of all slasher films because without it there would be no Halloween, Friday The 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Scream. In Halloween even star Jamie Lee Curtis as the main character, the daughter of Psycho's Janet Leigh, and \\"Sam Loomis\\" the character name in Psycho was re-used. It is one of the most frightening films of all time. <BR> The film starts out with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), desperate to try to find a way to be with her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). She steals money from her boss and runs to California. She ends up at the Bates Motel on a rainy and meetswith the shy manager, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). He offers her a room and meal in the parlor. He speaks to her of the traps that people go through in life. Marion changed her mind and resolves to go back and return the money. But too soon, Marion is killed by \\"Mother\\". Others arrive at the Bates Motel looking for her, including Loomis, detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam), and Lila (Vera Miles. They make horrible discoveries by end of the film. <BR>     The actors and actresses in Psycho were awesome in the way they played their characters. Janet Leigh was exceptional during the conversation in the parlor. I watched her as she shifted back and forth in unease; I felt sympathy for her. I wanted to scream for her to run out of go back into her room. Anthony Perkins did a wonderful job as well. If it weren't a movie, I'd think he actually was mentally ill. He exudes nervousness through the movie screen as he walks about eating candy. No one can recapture this film, not even Gus Van Sant. Vince Vaughn who played Norman Bates in the remake of Psycho can not and will never achieve what Perkins did. There was always something lacking in the modern remake even though it was redone frame by frame. The modern actors just didn't cut it.<BR>     I remember watching Psycho when I was younger. I couldn't take a shower for days. The famous shower scene was frightening with the weird \\"screech screech\\" music. It really made me think of knives. Now I associate the soundtrack with knives. It has influenced much of society today because probably it's not just me who associates the soundtrack with knives but many others. <BR>Overall, I loved the film. It was a great and surprising movie that kept me on edge till the very end. There could have been more added to the ending but if it were changed it would not be Psycho anymore. This influential movie will be one of the great slasher films of all time even centuries from now. I recommend this movie to those who have not seen it. A beautiful, wonderful, frightening classic.
B00006HBUB|5.0|Although I was at first quite skeptical about watching a movie that was based on a cartoon show,  after seeing Scooby Doo however I found I had really enjoyed myself. The movie although not oscar material certainly entertains, director Raja Gosnell does a superb job as do the actors of making the characters of mystery inc funny and very likeable. I thought the filmakers did a wonderful job casting this film. There is plenty of gags and phsical comedy for the kids and enough adult themed jokes to keep teenagers interested. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to enjoy themselves.

Oyster Boy is the lovechild of Shel Silverstein and Edgar Allan Poe. The illustrations alone are just gorgeous. I wouldn't recommend this for children, though.

B00005AQGH|5.0|It's crazy to me now that i look back at this album and get back the old feelings i had about 2pac before his violent death. Back in '96 when his last album while he was still alive came out &quot;all eyez on me&quot; 2pac was a superstar like no other. His run in's with the law and the historic beef with the east coast(mainly bad boy, biggie, puff) gave 2pac his thug life title back. Right after his death pac comes out with his most lively detailed album of his career titled under his alias Makaveli. <br />If u never heard this record like many people out there, then u must know that Pac was still beefing with his east coasts rivals and calls them out, by name in numerous tracks. He even calls out a super producer of Death Row(2pac &amp; snoops label) who left the label earlier that year, i'll let you figure that one out. The album starts off with &quot;Bomb first&quot; a mocking intro with disses pointed out to Biggie, mobb deep and Jay-z. The first track opens with gun shots and Makaveli spitting verses of heated threats with a dark off track beat. &quot;Bomb first&quot; pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the album with &quot;hail mary&quot;, an instant classic following with PAc once again spitting dark poetic lyrics. On the both tracks, pac features members of the OutLAWZ who late in '99 came out with thier own album respectively called &quot;2pac and Outlaws: still i rise.&quot; The members do hold their own throughout the album however. <br />The next two tracks &quot;toss it up&quot; &amp; &quot; to live and die in L.A.&quot; shows pacs love for women, california and also exposes some darker reflects mostly at the end of each track. Both tracks are solid, production is great through out the entire album as are the lyric vibes. Some other great tracks on the album are &quot;crazy&quot; a regret and hopeful view thru pacs eyes and the metaphoically (spelling?) driven &quot;me and my girlfriend&quot; give the album it's creative and touching feel.<br />In all Makaveli is a great LP with some of Pac's best work since &quot;me against the world&quot;. His theme may be negative and contridictive but pac showed his emotional side and put an album out that diplayed why he is considered by many, the best Emcee of all times. It's just too bad things went the way they did.......R.I.P.
0783225849|4.0|\\"Psycho\\"-one of the best films of its time- creates vivid images for its audience. Hitchcock depicts a world full of love and greed by placing at the center of this twisted plot at a motel surrounded by darkness. \\"Psycho\\" makes its name well known by its quality of acting, symbolism, and elements of surprise.<BR> The characters in \\"Psycho\\" are believable. Anthony Perkins, who does a superior job of playing his role of the murderer named Norman, is attracted Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh.) Perkins acts exceptionally well. He appears to want Marion for himself, but he can't have her due to a force that controls him. An example of Perkins acting abilities demonstrates how he appears to be a friendly person but in another scene he emerges with hatred filled face. His presence of another being inside him is best portrayed in the scene when Marion and Norman are sitting in the backroom. Marion begins to ask the questions about putting his mother away in an institution, making Norman's face change shape and appear dark and mysterious.  I think that this aspect is important to the film because if he wasn't able to show a dark side we would never know when he is somewhat \\"possessed.\\" Critics think the psychiatrics conclusion is not important to the ending- I would have to agree. His diagnosis was not relevant because Hitchcock already visually explained what happened. We don't need it repeated.<BR> The use of symbols in the movie not only creates a stronger level of suspense, but also shows Hitchcock's own fears. Hitchcock uses what he is afraid of in his own life because it's usually relevant to everyone's as well. The use of the symbols in any movie lets the audience understand more about the individual who produced it. An example of understanding Hitchcock more is the symbol of the policeman. Hitchcock had a fear of cops because when he was boy his father played a trick on him that has forever had an influence on him. Even though the policeman appeared normal you could tell by his dark figure that the man didn't seem right. Using the cop is a good idea to incorporate himself into the movie while creating a disturbing image. Another symbol used in the film is the use of birds, which don't have any relevance to Hitchcock but create suspense. The birds could be considered as someone watching the persons every move. The eye is also used when Norman looks through the wall, and this image is creepy because of the thought of someone watching. I think that the eye is a vital part of the films symbolism to heighten the suspense. The symbols used in the movie bring out a meaning portion of Hitchcock's life, and make it more suspenseful.<BR> The element of suspense makes the movie \\"Psycho\\" what it is; nail biting. In the movie there is no thrill that creeps out at you and makes you want to jump out of your seat. Instead you are calmly placed with little bits of the puzzle to slowly make you gain more interest. The movie is not about blood and gore, but rather keeping your attention throughout the movie using symbols to make a long lasting suspense. To make the screen play more believable the sound used during the film helps create a more eerie feeling when watching. Your spine starts to tingle as the music grows louder, and the thought of something jumping out is only what Hitchcock wants you to think. The use of black and white also gives a sense of suspense because we are able to see dark things perceived as evil and whiter textures associated with good. When watching, you begin to feel bad things approaching, and making your eyes become more focused. Suspense is an important key to every movie, and this movie uses it to keep the audience fix to the screen. <BR> The quality of acting brings out suspense through symbols in the movie \\"Psycho.\\" The actors in the movie do an excellent job of making themselves believable in the role that they play, which is important to make a successful film. The uses of symbols help the movie provide stronger images for a viewer to become more intrigued. The suspense is never ending. This helps make the movie more appealing to keep your interest. Overall the movie isn't considered to be a classic in my opinion, but is a strong structure for other films to work from to present a better movie.

He shares with us everything from new friends, first crushes, parties and more.He takes you through what seems to be a typical teenagers life. <BR>   This book was an amazing book that I would recommend to anyone. Once I picked it up to read I couldnt set it back down. Stephen Chbosky is an amazing writer with other great books.After reading this book it made me feel like i already knew who Charlie was. All his secrets and things he might have not told anyone else was all written down in his diary.
0061015725|4.0|This was truly a quick read.  If you want pure action and simple plot structure, this novel is for you.  Crichton provides amazing details on nanotechnology and makes interesting predictions as to where we [society] might be headed with regards to it.<BR>I enjoyed reading this novel and became more interested in nanotechnology as a result.  I suggest this book to anyway who likes a somewhat futuristic story with lots of action.

0385504209|4.0|I just couldn't get into this one, and I gave my first copy away without reading it.  Then, the pressure building from those I love who read it and LOVED it, I bought a second copy, which I also set aside.  I also bought &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; with this second copy.  And after reading &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; two nights ago, I finally earnestly opened &quot;DaVinci&quot; and read it.<br />This one is a better write.  Dan Brown shows more polish with the second Robert Langdon tale.  But it does go on, doesn't it?<br />I admire Brown's obsession with facts, and I like his web site that backs up his phenomenal best seller.  But I feel as if the super escapes that Brown's Langdon and his new female quester pull off are a bit more than super improbable.  Great fantasy entertainment.<br />Of course, all the Grail mystery and that of the Knights Templar and even Leonardo, are good bases for a new version of a suspenseful novel.  I think the folks reading this to bide their time on airplanes and in transit otherwise are sure to find the book up there with the Clancy's and Cussler's of the last century.<br />Obviously, the whole world is still searching for the truths to things that are steeped in legend.  And not discounting the faith of millions, I can see why true believers in Christ will be more than a little offended by the &quot;Code's&quot; telling.<br />I will be amused to see what Dan Brown creates for Robert Langdon's next adventure.  I understand it will center on Florence, Italy.  Hmmm?  Can Michaelangelo be next as we have examined Bernini in &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; and Leonardo in &quot;Code&quot;?  With Blythe Brown being an art historian, I guess that symbologist Langdon can be assured of a long path to come, as written by Dan Brown, her spouse.<br />Whatever he comes up with, I hope his writing continues to improve, and I do think he owes me a good story, as I have added to his coffers by three hardcovers already!!! :-)
B000021XS0|5.0|I have known of the band Dream Theater for several years, and while I had heard about the drumming abilities of Mike Portnoy and the amazing speed of John Petrucci, I never quite got around to really listening to their music. I ended up finally listening to a few tracks, but the one thing that got me was an online mp3 of Petrucci playing, i kid you not, flight of the bumblebee on his guitar, and playing it stupid fast. That decided it for me, I knew i was going to love this band, and this album was the one that assured it. I had a friend who told me it was their best, and after having heard several tracks from albums such as &quot;Awake&quot; and &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence,&quot; I was a bit skeptical, as I was expecting a mind-blowing performance.<br />     But there it was, &quot;Scenes from a Memory.&quot; I picked it up and never looked back. Once I heard the instrumental insanity of &quot;Fatal Tragedy,&quot; I was ready to jump out of my skin. Being somewhat of an amateur guitar player of about a year, when I heard Petrucci rip i was stunned. He is, in my opinion, the greatest living guitar player out there. And that's not just based on speed, but the technicality and musicianship of the music is brilliant.<br />     Not to mention the strange (and sometimes creepy) theme of the album gives them a great originality. The final track, once you've listened to it completely, is the strangest ending to an album I've ever heard, especially if you're like me and your name is Nicholas (you know what I mean if you've heard it and you should hear it if you haven't). But the story behind the music makes it even more enjoyable, and you seem to connect to the music more.<br />     And for the metal lovers that listen to this band, they tend to complain about LaBrie's vocals being too soft. But for many of you out there who are like me, it's like a dream come true: hard and unbelieveable metal music that isn't completelety ruined by screaming, growling, or any other form of musical garbage that most &quot;metal&quot; band today use. This is finally the perfect incorporation of a good singer with good hard metal music that will have your stereo on repeat for a good long time.<br />     I know I'm not the first person to say great things about this band, and I know I'm not going to be the last, but if you are looking for a break from the mainstream &quot;metal&quot; of today's world, this album is for you (and &quot;Train of Thought&quot; is not). Dream Theater is by far one of the best (for lack of a better term) progressive rock/metal groups out there, and if that doesn't interest you, the several ballads that are worked in may suite your softer side. All in all, this is the most brilliant musicianship I've heard come from 5 men. Simply astounding, pick it up &amp; find out for yourself. I'll never let this album go, and will be listening to it for the rest of my life.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I have had the Say You Will album since last spring. It is like wine, it gets better with time. When I first heard it last spring I thought it was good. I listened to it quite often in my car and with each listening it got better. I then saw Fleetwood Mac in concert on their tour last summer and the new songs were great in concert. It is a mature album. If you are looking only for light pop music you will be disappointed, say You will covers a broad specterum of music, pop, soft rock,and hard rock. It remindes my of when I first heard the Tusk album. I was dissapointed because it did not sound like Rumors but, over the years Tusk became my favorite album of Fleetwood Mac. Say You Will shows the true talent and vision of Fleetwood Mac. Lindsey Buckingham is a true musical artist, uncompromising to his craft. I respect him for taking a chance with some over the top tunes and not playing it safe with a strict formula. Yes, there are a couple of songs I could do with out but as a whole Say You Will, is an excellent album and should have won a grammy. Buy it, you will be satisfied
6305127638|5.0|May be the best of all of the Trek movies.  Even Number One looks like he lost weight for this one!<br />From the very beginning to its final moments, this is a script that shines.  Great characters.  Sharp, fresh dialogue, terrific and appropriate humor, exciting scene after exciting scene, and an enemy worthy of the chase.  I watched this again after a year or so of its release and it was every bit as entertaining.<br />Weak moments?  Deanna.  Marina Sirtis is just a lousy actress, and her bad delivery and semi-comatose performance (her best scene is one in which she's dead drunk) take away more than they should from the movie.  But that's a small complaint for such a great action movie.<br />Bravo!
079284131X|4.0|You must buy this DVD for one reason and one reason alone.  Jack Colvin!  Jack gives a fantastic performance starring as Dr. Ardmore, little Andy's Psych Doctor. Although Jack Colvin (one of the greatest character actors from the 19670-1980's)is only in the movie for about 5 minutes he makes this movie great rather than good. See Ch. 29 &quot;Electrified Exit&quot; and you'll see what I mean (warning - very graphic scene where Dr. Armore &quot;checks out early&quot; ouch!).  Jack Colvin is one of only a handful of actors that could pull that scene off.  Great stuff! Should have been nominated for an Academy Award! For more Jack Colvin genius,  reference any &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; episode from the 1980's (starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferigno)<br />Overall, the movie is one of the better thrillers from the 1980's and is worth watching at least once.  Chucky is cool and Brad Dourif brings a freakish edge to the whole movie.  Sound is decend for a dolby 2.0 mix. Unfortunately, there is nothing in terms of extras.  Hopefully, the studio will release a &quot;special edition&quot; with deleted scenes (More Dr. Ardmore please!)and possibly a &quot;making of&quot; featurette with interviews from the legendary, Jack Colvin.
B000002AE3|4.0|I have recently purchased Tambu.Since Jeff Porcaro's unfortunate passing he can't really be replaced but Simon Phillips is certainly as good as it gets. I have always admired this band because they contribute to the music as a band,not just one individual's take on writing lyrics and music. I have all of the band's music except Through The Looking Glass and I just love these guys. Gift Of Faith, Slipped Away,Time Is The Enemy,Drag Him To The Roof and Dave's Gone Skiing, The Road Goes On are very strong tracks. This band will probably never get the credit they are due. Too many people have only heard their ballads on the radio. I have always found that radio hits are not always very representative of the real talent in a band.
0060934913|5.0|With this book, Tony Bourdain has turned himself from an average New York City chef and a below average mystery novel writer into a very much above average reporter on the American culinary world. The book is basically a memoir, starting with several chapters that chronicle Bourdain's introduction and early career in the food service industry. Oddly enough, as different as Bourdain seems from your typical Food Network celebrity, he does actually seem to fit the mold of many, those as different as Mario Batali, Bobby Flay, and Alton Brown. If you are to believe the public persona of these swells, they all share the same early exposure and infatuation with culinary skills, an adolescent wildness (maybe not with Alton), and a blossoming into a successful, inspiring career when they find their proper niche in the culinary world.<br />The overriding message of the book is the same I have seen in all books written from the inside. Cooking in a busy restaurant kitchen, especially for the executive chef working the line or the expediting table is very, very hard work. Looking in from the outside, it is so hard, it is sometimes hard for me to appreciate how anyone would actually want to do it, let alone revel in it. This is especially true because we are not talking about Daniel Boulud or Charlie Trotter here. Bourdain may have been considered a `master chef', but he was in charge of the kitchen in a relatively undistinguished New York City brassiere lookalike. He is not creating new cuisine at his job, he is recreating classic French cuisine in a restaurant named after a famous French market. Not very much room for improvisation here.<br />Bourdain's tales of his early career are an enjoyable first course, but the real meat of the matter is in his tales of New York City restaurants behind the scenes. His trademark revelation is the fact that, in general, the fish served by restaurants on Monday is left over from deliveries made on Friday, but his most interesting stories revolve around a real restaurant owner whose identity Bourdain hides with the nom de guerre of `Bigfoot'. Bigfoot succeeds in the very difficult restaurant business with a passionate attention to the details of purchasing, chef's operations, and kitchen design.<br />My favorite story is the one of an artisinal bread starter, sometimes known as a poolish or sponge maintained by a singularly irresponsible baker who, with fermented hunks of this sponge made some of the best bread to be found in five states, including New York City. The introduction to this character is a desperate call to Bourdain in the middle of service from the baker requesting that someone in the kitchen feed the sponge. The name he gave the sponge would probably not make it through Amazon.com's automated review censor. I had no sense of what the role of this kind of sponge played in bread baking when I first read this, but after having read several books on artisinal bread baking, I appreciate the humor and irony even more than I did on first reading.<br />I have read many books on the culinary world since I first read `Kitchen Confidential' and most of the names like Rippert, Bouley, and Luongo unfamiliar to me on first reading are now counted as spiritual intimates. This makes Bourdain's book the sort of work which rewards rereading after two or three years have passed.<br />This book may be a classic in the very small field of culinary journalism.volve around a real restaurant owner whose identity Bourdain hides with the nom de guerre of `Bigfoot'.

0385504209|2.0|Anyone who thinks this is a great piece of fiction does not know a thing about writing. But I'm willing to admit that this book is great fun to read - there are times when I do crave a mindless ride through formulaic cheap writing techniques, eg, plot postponement, multiple climaxes, deja vu, blah blah blah. This book is &quot;good&quot; only in the sense that it fulfills a niche of bad fiction that somehow still remains entertaining. It is bad fiction because every element - every twist of plot, every detail of &quot;history&quot; and art, every character - is a slave to the author's attempt to continually surprise and keep the reader on edge. when characters are enslaved by plot, there can be no depth or meaning or DEVELOPMENT at all throughout the book. but dan brown was successful in surprising the reader - albeit, in a predictable way - the careful reader of literature knows what i mean by &quot;surprise in a predictable way&quot;<br />this book is good for what it is - lazy reading that is simply entertaining, nothing more - not informative nor meaningful. it is entertaining if you love superficial suspense thrillers; it is also entertaining if you love to make fun of artificial suspense thrillers. this book is NOT, i repeat, NOT intellectual in any way, nor does it possess any &quot;meaning&quot; - in the cognitive or affectual sense of the word. it's about as deep as a petri dish, and if you know what that is, you probably should not read this book unless you have a good 8 hours with absolutely nothing to do.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|good acting.  beautiful views of the city.  incredibily overrated.  with all of the hype surrounding this movie, i figured i would save myself the 4 bucks it would cost to rent this movie and just go ahead and buy it...b/c i was assured by the world that i would like it.  so i'm sitting, watching, trying to be engaged by this 'amazing' movie, 30mins, 60mins, 90mins...still waiting for the scene where i come to love this movie, that defining moment when i identify and empathize with the screenwriter, the characters, the city.  45 mins into it my wife said, 'this is dumb' and i said, 'wait, maybe the big payoff is coming.  i'm still waiting.  with the exception of the cinematography, there is nothing in this movie that wasn't in harold and maude...that other weird movie about the old and the young shacking up.  i can't even really describe what this movie is about.  is it a midlife crisis movie?  a movie about loners and lonliness?  a soulmate movie?  my wife pointed out that trying to tell someone about this movie would be a difficult chore b/c no matter what you said, no matter how you recalled the story, the message, one way or another, would get...lost in translation.

0060263857|5.0|For many a literary child, \\"Charlotte's Web\\" is the first sad book they read.  It is an early reader story that looks death straight in the eye without blinking or making up wild stories.  It is honest and pure and the best kind of book for adults or children and I love it very much.<br />The plot begins with the best possible opening sentence:<br />\\"Where's Papa going with that ax?\\", said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast.<br />Papa is, of course, going out to kill Wilbur the runt piglet.  Saving him from this fate, Fern takes a personal interest in the pig, raising him by hand until he is bought by her uncle.  On the farm, Wilbur makes the acquaintance of Charlotte A. Cavatica, a beautiful kind spider.  The two grow to become good friends, and it is through Charlotte's cunning that she finds a way to ultimately save Wilbur from becoming bacon for breakfast  The book not only gives sympathy to pigs as adorable little creatures (as back-flipping Wilbur, helped by Garth Williams's illustrations, most certainly is) but also to spiders as well.  Charlotte is beautifully written.  A perfect lady with an amazing vocabulary, she is the height of poise and good manners.  The grand dame of the barnyard.  E.B. White brilliantly captures emotions that all children can identify with.  Loneliness, fear, friendship, and love.  The story is simple, but undoubtedly White's best.<br />Disney approached White about animating \\"Charlotte's Web\\", an offer White adamantly refused.  Years later the film was animated instead by a studio that was not Disney, making a truly terrible movie out of a pretty spectacular book.  This is for the best, though.  Had Disney succeeded in getting the rights, we would probably be remembering the movie and not the book (much as when we think of Mary Poppins we forget it was once a story).  Hence, \\"Charlotte's Web\\" remains a masterpiece.  A quiet lovable masterpiece.
0440224764|2.0|What an utter disappointment!  I have read a few of Grisham's books, usually quite good.  Unfortunately this is incredibly poor.  Weak, unlikable characters.  Shallow uninteresting story.  Hands down the worst ending of any book I have read.  Look at other Grisham books or move onto Crichton or Dan Brown for a better thriller.
B000083E79|5.0|I already have to start buying a new copy of Cher's latest album because I've been listening to it so much!  It's a great compilation similar to her earlier greatest hits album (&quot;If I Could Turn Back Time-Cher&quot;) but it also includes her most recent dance material. I love the remix of &quot;One By One&quot; (a remix taken from the not-so-sucessful &quot;It's A Man's World&quot; in the mid 90's)especially for the edit because the original is pretty long. Her two biggest and probably best solo hits &quot;Believe&quot; (#1 Pop) and &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; (#3 Pop, written by Diane Warren) as well as her older number one hits from the 70's like &quot;Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves&quot; and one of my favorites &quot;Half-Breed.&quot;  The only problem is she could have substituted &quot;Save Up All Your Tears&quot; with the bigger top 40 hit &quot;Love And Understanding&quot; (another Diane Warren one, both from the album &quot;Love Hurts&quot;). Also the ballad &quot;Way of Love&quot; could have been on here too as well as &quot;Baby Don't Go&quot; one of my favorite Sonny &amp; Cher songs!  BUt this is still a great collection even though it's flawed in terms of HITS. One of my favorite Cher songs &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; (from the album of the same title) didn't chart as well as &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; but still a top 40 hit is on here.  Another favorite is the country-ish &quot;Just Like Jesse James&quot; which according to her &quot;Farewell Tour&quot; DVD (also reccomended) isn't one of her favorites (they never hada video but it was a big hit).  Anuyways if you love Cher pick up this great collection. Also makes a great gift!
0385507755|5.0|&quot;A MILLION LITTLE PIECES by James Frey provides a rare look inside the lost soul who has fallen from the top all the way to the gutter.<br />The look at drug addiction is unforgiving and stunningly vivid. <br />In terms of the details of the story and honest notions on the soul sucking nature of the nastiness of addiction, &quot;A MILLION LITTLE PIECES&quot; is on the same level of brilliance and brutal fascination as &quot;MY FRACTURED LIFE&quot; by Rikkilee Travolta.

B00000DG1R|4.0|have listened to Duran Duran for the past 22 years. My sister was a 'Duranie' so for a while I had no choice. My interest in them waned after the departure of Andy and Roger Taylor, but I still listened, but followed Andy's career more closely, which met with little critical and commercial success. <BR>To the reviewers who compared Duran Duran to Led Zepplin, it is clear that Led Zep brought more to the music scene than Duran Duran. However, those who claim that this group has no talent are way off base. When I want to look for bands without talent I look at N'sync, Backstreet boys, Celine Dion, Brittany Spears, and the like who not only sing songs others have written, and cannot pick up any instrument if thier life depended on it. <BR>These guys wrote and played thier own music, and it has withstood the test of time. Whether you like them or not, they are here, and they are real musicians. True they capitalized on their good looks and music videos, but they are putting out a new cd with the original five soon, and have been rocking in one form or another continuously for the past 25 years, which many bands, including the Great Led Zepplin cannot claim. <BR>The album itself is a mistake, as it should have been a double album. Most of the stuff on this was on Decade, which was not that great either. I was suprised when it came out as they had already put out Decade. I did not buy it, but received it as a gift. The only post 85 studio album I owned was the Wedding album so it was nice to get copies of the songs such as Serious and Electric Barbarella. The album should have included other tunes as others mentioned such as My own way, Careless Memories, Meet El Presidente, and maybe could have included the side project band hits from Powerstation and Arcadia.  <BR>This album is worthwhile if you own little or no Duran Duran, otherwise save up and buy the Box Set of singles 81-85, the night-versions, or strange behaviour, and wait for thier new album which should be outsometime soon.
B0000035E7|4.0|OK, we've just had two reasonably articulate and extremely scathing reviews of this album, and Nirvana's career in general. Hurling crude insults at a man who had an extremely short, troubled and painful life is a little bit cheap, but never mind. However, millions of people are Nirvana fans, and many of them like Bleach. I'm one of them. Here's why:<BR>Bleach is the first of three studio albums recorded by Nirvana and catches them in a formative stage, playing dives and recording on a shoestring budget. It's the only album they recorded which isn't a stone-cold classic, but it's still worth shelling out for if you like the other two. Kurt's songwriting is still developing, and cuts towards the end of the album such as Swap Meet and Sifting are some of the few Nirvana songs that can be truthfully described as filler. But there are some gems on here, diamonds in the rough. About A Girl, apparently  written after an afternoon of repeatedly listening to With The Beatles, is just the best known. The melody is possibly the best hook on the album, and although the Unplugged version is probably better this one is enjoyably ragged. Negative Creep is brilliant, a primitive, roaring riff with a demented scream of a vocal over the top of it. Blew, the opener, is another highlight - the downtuned riffing is typical of much of the rest of the album but  the tune and, particularly, Kurt's delivery of it take it to the next level. The Love Buzz cover is also excellent, featuring a great performance on bass by Novoselic, who seems to stand out more than he did after Dave Grohl joined the band. The majority of the rest of the tracks are a good listen as well, growing on you with time. The rawness of the recording actually does it some favours: they never sounded more punk (those who doubt Cobain's integrity on this score: spend your entire adult life totally dedicated to music to the exclusion of practically everything else and THEN call the man a fake). All in all, a great, but nottranscendent, listen.<BR>Nirvana went on to become huge, and eventually the mania destroyed its frontman. Some people called Kurt a sell-out, and persist to this day, overlooking the fact that he maintained strong links with the underground, constantly using his privileged position to help other bands to attain a similar level of recognition. I'm not saying the man was the messiah, or that he was a genius, in fact he could have been a total idiot for all I care. He was a damn good songwriter, and his band rocked. And they captured the zeitgeist in a way that technically superior bands from the same grunge movement failed to do so (irrelevant for me, discovering them as I did retrospectively). At the root of the hype is a bunch of solid rock 'n' roll performances that will ultimately survive it.<BR>Buy In Utero and Nevermind first, by the way...
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Warning: spoilers in this review!<br />This film's lead characters are adrift in a world so removed from their understanding and immediate concern that it seems almost imaginary.  With no obligations to attend to, they're suspended outside of time as well.  They meet, there's attraction, they hesitate to act on it, and for most of the movie they exist in a private world made almost solely of that tension.  Many of these reviews are spot-on in describing the whole experience (both for the characters and the audience) as dreamlike.<br />When the characters have to return to their lives at the end, you'd expect a catharsis of some kind, a revelation bringing a new level of understanding as they're waken from their dream.  Instead, Coppola gives the biggest cop-out, non-ending I've seen in years.  The &quot;speech the audience can't hear&quot; isn't poignant  -- it shows that director Coppola doesn't understand the characters she's created and doesn't have a clue what they actually would do in that situation.  It woke me, the audience, from the dream I was in -- and like many dreams and summer camp romances, it all seems far less deep, meaningful or important afterwards.<br />When Coppola leaves the audience to fill in whatever ending they want, that's not sublime or profound. It's the catchy jingle of a radio tune, where the lyrics give you the barest of frameworks so that you can fill the rest in from your own experiences and desires.  That can be entertaining, and it can mean a lot to you personally.  But that doesn't make it Great Art, and it doesn't make me shallow, unintelligent or insensitive for prefering movies with more substance and insight.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Reading the editorial review, you may be misled into believing that this is a dry and academic,only for diehards DVD.Wrong, this is an exceptionally well made and researched documentary. And, if anything the first disc, with their pre-fame story, is perhaps the most fascinating disc of the lot. Considering that The &quot;Fabs&quot; were the most important and influentual pop/rock group of the 20th. century, I consider this essential viewing, and hugely enjoyable, don't miss out!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a highly instructive DVD, because it shows how a half-decent film could have been even better. The deleted scenes included on this DVD are of exceptionally high quality, and makes you yearn for an extended 'Director's Cut'.<br />As Curtis says in his introduction, he shot far too many scenes, and was forced to prune 80 minutes' worth. Whole characters are deleted from the movie -- e.g. the headmistress, her lover (Frances de la Tour), and most of Emma Thompson's wayward son. Personally, I feel this approach is undesirable, when it means that you as the director have to explain to several major actors that none of their scenes is in the final movie.<br />The editing decisions that Curtis forced upon himself explain why the film at the cinema appeared to be a bit of a dog's dinner, redeemed by a number of uplifting sub-plots. The extras included with DVD encourage the viewer to try to build their own version. Personally I would eliminate the annoying brother-in-the-asylum sub-plot. The story of the two nude stand-ins is the least integrated with the other plots, and removing that story would also help to make the film more child-friendly.<br />Heavy with a head-cold, Curtis also explains why he chose five of the key tunes in the movie. It's clear that music, particularly as created by female singer-songwriters, is a very central part of Curtis's life. Viewing that interview has directly led to my ordering the referenced Joni Mitchell CD from Amazon.<br />The commentary is rather fun, provided by Curtis, Grant, Nighy (occasionally) and the 10-year-old boy. Curtis frequently feeds Grant with opportunities to diss Colin Firth -- e.g. when Curtis mentions that the French villa used for the writer's refuge has subsequently burnt down, Grant asks \\"Was Colin still in it?\\". Curtis starts the commentary, by the way, five minutes before Grant arrives -- stuck in traffic -- and soon after his arrival, Grant has to take a mobile call from his golf coach. The banter is generally at this Oxford level, and Nighy seems left out. Curtis is also aware that the 10-year-old probably shouldn't be watching a 15-certificate film, but the lad does OK.<br />As for the movie itself, I still maintain that it proves that Emma Thompson is the finest actress of her generation. A big [disappointment] that she didn't get best supporting actress at the Oscars.<br />Anyway, see what you think. Curtis's DVDs always get the most repeated viewing in our household. Definitely worth investing in. A 4-star film with a 5-star commentary.nerally at this Oxford level, and Nighy seems left out.

B000060P79|1.0|simple plan are a band like anyother trying to make it big. but with the gay lyrics and crap vocals, they shouldnt even be  a  band..<BR>i definatly recomend this for ppl really into the whole POP punk, thing if you want it more like nsync.  <br />download id do anything, and youll be fine. nothing else on this cd is worth money!!
B00005JKZV|1.0|Put simply, this movie is just terrible. Compared to the incredibly good first movie, this movie is not just bad, it's incredibly bad.<BR>The main features of this movie are talking trees you can't understand, one pointless bloody battle screen after another, an adulterated story line that a particle physicist couldn't keep track of, and a Golem that isn't a fraction as loathsome or frightening as the one I imagined when I read the books. <BR>The first movie had a feeling of wonder and magic about it. This movie has a feeling of gore and death about it. <BR>After watching the first movie, I wished J.R.R.T. could have been alive to be proud of what they had done with his great creation. After watching this movie, I was glad he was spared the embarrassment.
B000005YZM|5.0|My wife and I cannot stop listening to this album. After a year of &quot;heavy rotation&quot; at our house, it's still fresh and compelling -- which is lucky for me, because she blasts it at least once a week, it's always the first thing she reaches for.<br />It's a bit unusual in some ways and took a few listens to grow on me, but now I'm convinced it's a masterpiece and I can't resist it. The arrangements and song topics are often unconventional, yet come off successfully.<br />Take &quot;Care of Cell 44&quot; for example -- the &quot;waiting for my girlfriend to get out of jail&quot; theme probably kept it off the radio, since that may seem corny at first.  What a shame, this has to be one of the most underrated songs of the 60's, written with compassion, depth and harmonies that make me drop whatever I'm doing to listen to them, even though I've heard this 50 times by now.<br />And that's just the first song.
B000000H57|5.0|Its my fault that I read alot of the reviews... I like Type O Negative now. This album just slightly escapes me makeing it perfect. No one else mentioned thier vivid similarities as a cross between Lycia and My Dying Bride(although thier not half as known but should be which is why I mention them so listen to some samples). This album is prog/goth/sludge-metal all tossed together in a great combo plater. Very edible and very rich but not like you can't go for a walk to burp it down.<br />If Type O Negative is depressing to you then this must be the first time you've been exposed to colorful or improvisational language.<br />Try the band &quot;Swans&quot; for culture and an understanding of the term influence. Listen to &quot;Lycia&quot; or &quot;Dead Can Dance&quot; when you want to melt your eye liner in droves. Then try &quot;Neurosis&quot; to understand depth and profoundity. <br />This album is fantastic. Buy this album... used or new... You can regret it if the money means that much to you...
0385512104|5.0|The story line of this novel would struggle to get to four stars on its own.  This is a five star book because of the writing.  Never have I read a book such as this where the writing was crafted so that it became such an integral part of the telling and the novel.<br />The plot is rather simple.  Christopher, the narrator, is an autistic teenager.  He finds a dog that has been murdered and decides to solve the crime.  From there the novel moves into a family in crisis.  Christopher is told his mother has died, only to find that is not the case.  Eventually he travels on his own to London - quite a feat for him.<br />What separates this book from the norm, though is how the author uses his writing - the telling - of the story to assist in the telling.  An example is in order.<br />At one point, Christopher is in atrain station in London.  This is a boy who hates crowds, strange places, strangers, new details in his surroundings, etc.  Not surprisingly, he is on the verge of panic while trying to stay sane, no less get out of the station somehow.  While reading, I came to a point where I said to myself: &quot;Whoa! Slow down! This is too much...&quot;  At that point I realized that that was a taste of what an autistic person goes through when he is unable to process all the stimulation he is getting.  This is what I mean by the writing was an integral part of the telling of the story.  It helped craft the story.  The pace and manner put the reader in the autistic's mind for short moment.  I do not know if there is a better way to create a better empathy with an autistic person.  In this way this book is pure genius.<br />The novel also shows the pressures put on a family attempting to raise an autistic child.  In this case, it pulls the family asunder, adding more conflict to the story line.<br />I strongly recommend this book.  It gives a revealing view of autism as well as being entertaining.  This is not a &quot;cause&quot; book, but one that reveals autism whileit entertains.
0800177177|3.0|When I first saw this film in high school I loved it! Now as I am older I can still enjoy it and not take it so seriously.  I can appreciate the artsy feel to it but the eroticism was too much.  It was as if the director really wanted to make sure you understood it was erotic.  To date it is the best adaption to the novel, excluding the love story graft that reminds me of the soap Dark Shadows (vampire finds his reincarnated lost love). (...)<br />But to answer some questions mentioned in earlier reviews (...), Dracula in the novel DOES WALK IN THE DAYLIGHT!!!!  In the novel as in folklore, vampires are NOT HARMED BY SUNLIGHT. Sunlight as sudden death for vampires was invented for Hollywood and adapted in novels ever since. So Dracula walking the streets of London by day fits with the novel. He is just weaken and volnerable in daylight. <br />So I like the film. I no longer love it now that I am older. I enjoy vampire novels but never seem statisfied with any of the movies (\\"Interview With A Vampire\\" was good though).  So if you are into artsy films with over the top romance this movie is for you . . . Just watch out for ape/wolf man thing sowing his wild oaks.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A beautiful little film that focusses on a slice of life. It won't be to everyone's taste, but if it is your cup of green tea you will find it absolutely magical.<br />I have an uncle who looks at the world very much like Bob Harris does in this film. It's always fun to be around him. That's one reason I could understand Scarlett's liking for him. <br />In the end it's always better to be a positive person than a negative one.
0440238609|1.0|What started out as an excellent fantasy yarn became more and more darker as it progressed. Although Pullman's narrative style is good and he paints a realistic fantasy world, what should be worrying for all parents (never mind of what relegious leanings) is his indirect attack on relegion.<br />This becomes more apparent only in the last book of the trilogy when a \\" senile god \\" is revealed whose dominion is being run by the villainous Archangel.<br />Thus the stage is set for the final fight with the Arhangel, with the senile deity being a bystander.<br />Notwithstanding the brilliance of the narrative and the various plots and sub plots, I wouldn't recommend these books for any children until they are adult and have formed their own opinions about relegion and the role of the Almighty.<br />One wonders whether the author is insinuating what seem to be his own personal antireligous convictions into the minds of innocent children or else this was just an undesired ending for a complicated struggle between good and evil. Unfortunately the evil here represents relegion.
0767020308|3.0|This was my first experience with a film of a beloved Jane Austen novel.  While this retelling of \\"Emma\\" was true to Jane Austen's book, I did not at all enjoy the casting, nor the acting of the two main characters. I did very much enjoy the portrayals of Harriet, Jane Fairfax, and Emma's father.  That being said, I was most disappointed in the portrayals of both Emma and Mr Knightly.<br />Kate Beckinsale creates a smug and immature Emma, thoroughly lacking in the \\"real\\" Emma's decorum and chic-ness so evident in the book even prior to her self-realization.  I also feel that her appearance was just too childlike to be credible.  Mark Strong's Mr Knightly was stern and wooden. I sensed no attraction between the two whatsoever!
0321127420|5.0|This book is a little more implementation specific than the incredibly popular Gang of Four Design Patterns book. Many of the patterns, the Data Transfer Object pattern, for example, are fairly specific to the J2EE structural problem at hand. Other patterns, like the Lazy Load, are good architectural patterns on any platform. There is enough generic content to justify the purchase of the book for architects implementing on any platform (J2EE, .NET, PHP, etc.) but it does favor the two current platforms de jour; J2EE and .NET.<br />One of the nice things about the book is how the code tends to de-emphasize the application container by doing most of the work in the raw database access systems (e.g. JDBC), which makes it easy to understand what is going on but will offend the true J2EE believer. This makes the patterns in the book accessible to anyone coding in any environment, which I greatly appreciate.<br />One pet peeve is that some of the patterns are obvious shells for a single technique, such as the Transform View, which is really just XSLT. The text says as much, but shouldn't there be more than one example of a particular pattern in nature? It's just a pet peeve though, it's no reason to avoid the book.<br />Overall, the book is well written and edited and the graphics add to the exposition but are not gratuitous. It's a useful guide for anyone looking to raise the level of the enterprise application (read web application) thought up to the next level.
B00013F38K|3.0|Although I have not watched all 15 episodes yet, I was disappointed to discover that a total of one to two minutes in each episode were cut.  While the short scenes that were cut were not crucial, they do create noticeable gaps in the smooth telling of the story.<br />It appears that the master tape used to make the DVD was not taken from the original series, but from a shortened version that was edited to make room for additional commercials when the show was shown in recent years.  The total run time for each episode is 50 minutes.<br />It is also not \\"complete\\" because the top and bottom of the screen have been cut to make it fit a widescreen format.<br />I purchased the DVD because, although I had recorded the series on VHS, I did not have all the episodes.  Therefore, I am happier with the DVD than without it; but I can only give it three stars since this is not the \\"complete first season.\\" It has been cropped and shortened.
B00005QCVY|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life is one of the staples of any cinematherapy collection. It is a remarkable feat to show us a man metaphorically drowning in despair and contemplating his literal suicide by drowning, and then to guide us through a deft tour de force that transforms that rejected/disowned life into one of joy, affirmation, and triumph! This film is Capra's greatest achievement, and Jimmy Stewart reported it as his personal favourite of his career.<br />I have recommended this film to many clients, and it has its own meaning to each of them. A number find it difficult to embrace a film that in many ways preaches the virtues of self-sacrifice and constantly putting the needs of others before that of the self: and in many ways, this does run counter to much of the emphasis that is ascribed to self-fulfilment and `personal actualization' in popular psychology. Despite these perceived difficulties, most of them find it to be up-lifting and a splendid affirmation of the human spirit. Not least because many of them have personal heroes or family members who have made remarkable personal sacrifices for the benefit of others: significantly, like George Bailey, it was enough for these people to have had the privilege of serving others, the sacrifices were not made with the intention of forming a network of obligation and guilt.<br />Bailey word paints a wonderful life for himself:<br />I'm shakin' the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm gonna see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum. Then, I'm comin' back here to go to college and see what they know. And then I'm gonna build things. I'm gonna build airfields, I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high, I'm gonna build bridges a mile long... <br />He makes a valiant defence of the civilising effect of giving working people the opportunity to benefit by their labours, and making them stake-holders in the community to which they belong. \\"This town needs this measly, one-horse institution if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to Potter.\\"<br />Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about. They do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.<br />Ironically, his verbal skills are partially responsible for the dashing of his dreams when his impassioned defence of his father's vision leads to the board voting to save the Bailey Savings and Loan Co. if George will agree to sacrifice his dreams, and stay on to succeed his father.<br />Throughout It's a Wonderful Life, we see George Bailey as all too human in his discontent, frustration, and despair, yet we also see him demonstrate the strengths and virtues that are the affirmation of what is best about the human spirit. Ironically, one of the strengths that he seems to lack is gratitude (see \\"Character Strengths and Virtues\\" by Peterson and Seligman; or \\"Authentic Happiness\\" by Marty Seligman, which also describes the `Gratitude Visit', of which the closing scenes of this film are such a triumphant example). The arc of the story gives us (and George) an opportunity to see what life would have been like if he had not been there: we have the nightmarish Pottersville, and a film noirish re-introduction to characters whom we have already `met' but now see in their degraded guise, because George was not there to help them (the degradation of the druggist, Mr. Gower, who is imprisoned for his dispensing error, and becomes the town drunk, is especially moving). Unbeknownst to him, George's compassion, love, and empathy have saved the human dignity and spirit of Bedford Falls.<br />We learn that George Bailey may be poor in material terms but he is spiritually rich in the goodwill and love that his actions have garnered. In contrast to the abuse of talents that is embodied in the sterile, spirit-destroying Potter, Bailey has social capital and learns the truth of his father's motto \\"All you can take with you is that which you've given away.\\" Clarence (the Angel/Guide) sums it up when he says,<br />You see, George, you've really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?<br />Ultimately, George Bailey leads a very different wonderful life to the one that he envisaged, but his reality is no less powerful or influential than the one he had constructed in his dreams. He may not have built the structures of which he dreamed, but he was responsible for the utopian/usonian Bailey's Fields, and shares some of the kudos for all of the social order and advantages that flowed from that strong community of families. Bailey may have been measured and categorised as 4F and unfit for military service, but his courageous actions as a child in saving his war-hero brother are shown to have indirectly influenced the survival of hundreds of soldiers. <br />George Bailey is one of those unsung heroes who is destined for `valour without renown': it is a moving irony that it takes the collapse of his world and a descent into despair for him to learn how much his life has enriched the lives of both those he knows, and those whom he will never know. It's A Wonderful Life is one of the finest cinematic affirmations of the human spirit.
B0000931OG|5.0|Because I loved the Albarn-Nyman sound track for 'Ravenous' I've been meaning to check out Blur for years. Better late than never. Initially this album left me cold, but I let it play in the background a while and it really ambushed me. It's been a while since I felt so compelled to recue the same CD multiple times a day. I guess I'll work my way backward through their catalog now.
B0000VCZK2|2.0|I thorougly enjoyed the first three Alien movies and eagerly awaited the release of this set.  I think the movies are great.  However, the set is the worst packaged DVD collection I have ever owned.  The individual plastic cases which secure each movie to the cardboard backing frequently come loose and must be reattached.  In addition, to take a movie out of the set, it must be unfolded to what seems like a length of six feet.  Come on Fox, get it right.  I would return these disks and buy the movies individually if I could.
B000002KIC|5.0|Great musicianship from the mainstay of the evening, with guest appearances from a host of the &quot;old school&quot; (rock?)stars during that period in American music (it feels odd referring to that period in a past tense, but it is almost 2 generations ago).  The Band couldn't have been rock.  Progressive, Alternative... it must drive the critics and catagorizers looney.  How about great music from North America.  Together this group had a fullness and richness to their sound that others in the field could only envy.  I recall that Clapton was reported to have left Cream and wanted to start up a group along the lines of the Band.  Clapton gets part of his wish and is invited to join in the festivities of the Last Waltz.  Can you imagine being there at this event?  It would have been a phenominal experience.  This release documents this historic occasion with an evening of stellar performances by all guests.  A beautiful release.
B000089RVX|5.0|How refreshing it is for a band like this to shove aside all the punk, rap, and pop trash that dominates the mainstream these days.     Crap like that has had such a hold on the charts that I thought I'd never see something like Evanescence in the mainstream, but when you are as good as this band, you force people to pay attention.  When you blend the vocals of Amy Lee with the metal of the rest of the band, the result is beyond what you could ever comprehend until you actually hear it.  To anyone who hasn't heard this band yet, check them out and be prepared to be knocked to the ground!
0385504209|3.0|I read this book after hearing the 20th person rave and gush about how she simply &quot;could not put it down!&quot;  I had little trouble putting it down, myself.  The Da Vinci Code is fun, but irritatingly commercial at times (starting with physical descriptions of our heroes, George Clooney and Julie Delpy, oops, I mean Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu).  Some of the facts are just off, and show the single-source limitations of Brown's &quot;exhaustive research&quot;:  for example, the selection of books for the New Testament was basically solidified more than 100 years before Emperor Constantine was a wicked gleam in his father's eye, contrary to Teabing's claim that Constantine handpicked the New Testament volumes for their marketing values.  Moreover, the canon of New Testament books was chosen from only 34 volumes, not 80.  (By the way, if you're curious about those rejected books, try reading their translations on earlychristianwritings.com.  It'll remind you of the well-circulated e-mail joke, &quot;Rejected Dr. Seuss Books.&quot;  You'll find that there are some good reasons why some of that material didn't make the cut, reasons that have little to do with portraying Jesus Christ in a negative light.  Some of those proposed books of the New Testament are just laughably bad and bizarre enough to convince one that the Mediterranean cultures of the early first millenium A.D. were growing more peyote than olives.)  Finally, I found that the puzzles lacked challenge:  anybody who'd passed 7th-grade math could recognize the members of the Fibonacci sequence, and I spotted them right off.  The anagrams were also obvious (duh, most famous artist in the world, most famous museum in the world, most famous painting in the world.  Duh.), and anybody who's ever been to Westminster Abbey wouldn't have been much fazed by the &quot;orb&quot; and the &quot;Pope&quot; cryptography.  If readers truly are looking for intellectually stimulating puzzles based on trivia about hoary-headed Western Civ All-Stars, try reading Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; instead.  I haven't read other Dan Brown books, but my advice to him would be to skip the cheese-filled &quot;it was all a dream&quot; epilogue in future works.  Not that my advice is worth anything to him...ry-headed Western Civ All-Stars, try reading Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; instead.

B0000AQVCL|1.0|jet = trendy &quot;retro&quot; pseudoclassic crap.  who seriously like this?  you'd have to have amnesia or something to not know that this is a complete ripoff of important music from the '60s and '70s.  somebody should push these guys, kings of leon, the vines, the white stripes and all the rest of them off a cliff.  seriously.
6305907145|1.0|I cannot believe that Jane Austen, with her subtlety and cool observations, would have cared for this sledgehammer-like exposition of the evils of slavery, and the abuses of the class system. The characters have little to do with her creations. The film simply throws Austen's Fanny Price out, and replaces her with a feminist changeling, who, however attractive in another film, is simply not what Austen meant at all. I think I see what the film makers were getting at. I don't, however, think they should have appended Jane Austen's name or the title of her novel to it.<br />If you are not a great lover of Jane Austen and her work, you might find the film interesting. If you are looking for a good and faithful adaptation of Mansfield Park, you will probably find the film intensely irritating, as I did.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Duran Duran's second album is the most beautiful thing I've ever listened to.  So full of substance and depth.  How could anyone choose the Police over this?  It's impossible!  Listen to the incredible \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" and the haunting \\"The Chauffer,\\" and you'll realize that this is no ordinary band.  This is an execptionally talented group that is so MUCH better than the Police.  \\"Rio\\" sold millions of millions of records and is one of the best sellers of all time.  It got reissued in 2001 so obviously there is still a demand for this band even after all this time.  Please, ignore any 1 star reviews of this album.  They are written by people with NO TASTE in music.

B000002GGU|5.0|Seven of the ten tracks on this album were all hits. A year after the release of CUTS LIKE A KNIFE,RECKLESS spawned six Top 20 hits. The album title is mentioned in AIN'T GONNA CRY,the last track on the CD. ONE NIGHT LOVE AFFAIR is one of the six Top 20 hits that should have appeared on the 1993 compilation SO FAR SO GOOD. KIDS WANNA ROCK was the only minor hit that appears on the compilation. Other hits are SOMEBODY,RUN TO YOU,IT'S ONLY LOVE with Tina Turner,SUMMER OF '69 and the love ballad HEAVEN. The latter title became the theme for many dances and proms as early as 1985. No other Bryan Adams album had a sales record as high as this one. Not even 1991's WAKING UP THE NEIGHBORS.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|....a Strokes clone with more &quot;edge&quot;.  A more accessible &quot;Strokes&quot;.  Pathetic.   How much would you like to bet that these guys were playing grunge 8 years ago and nu metal or pop punk 4 years ago?  STARTILINGLY unorginal and uninteresting.  A &quot;Strokes&quot; for the middle American bar crowd.  Man do I despise bands like this.  This is the kind of crap Creed fans would buy to say that they have &quot;diverse&quot; musical tastes!!!  LOL!!  : )
B000005JA8|1.0|Thank goodness some people have the courage to speak out against this claptrap.  Not too many people are actually going to say anything bad about truly solid music.  Most of us commenting on this album are open-minded and willing to listen to new/experimental music (how else would we have heard of beefheart?).  However, this album is just terrible, and it's important that people not put up with jokes just because they are new or different.  Let's have some standards: we want new and interesting music, but it has to be well done.  Beefheart meets the first qualification easily, but fails miserably at the second.  1 star only.
B00008973Q|5.0|I read &quot;King Lear&quot; several years ago and I confess that I got lost from time to time in the play.  I believe that I understand it a lot better now that I have seen &quot;Ran&quot;.  This is one of those film epics ala &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot; or &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; with the added bonus that Shakespeare helped with the screenplay.  I might get into trouble with that last comment.  After all, the language was a little more down to earth but still on a level well above your typical epic.  This foreign film won an Academy Award for best costume design and it's not hard to see why.  The only problem is, nobody ever seems to get theirs dirty except when they're killed.  There are a number of battle scenes that bring to mind the old film trailer line..A CAST OF THOUSANDS.  The color and quality of the film are superb on this version at least until the last part where it darkened rather noticeably.  Although it's 160 minutes in length, I have no complaints about that fact.  I do have to admit that I had to take a break a time or two to run some errands but the story line was well developed so I had no trouble picking up where I left off.  This would have been an impressive movie to see on the big screen.  Like the play, this is a tragedy in which many characters are killed but the motivation behind it all is the heart of it's story.<br />As I always do with foreign language DVD's, I watched this initially in its' original language with English subtitles.  The acting was so good, I believe I will continue to watch it that way.  I would recommend this movie to anyone has something of an appreciation for Shakespeare and an appreciation for good movies.  I came away with the impression that I had just seen a cinema classic for the ages.  You may just get the same reaction.
B000002G26|5.0|SO FAR SO GOOD was very excellently titled for this compilation. Six RECKLESS tracks include HEAVEN,SOMEBODY,SUMMER OF '69,RUN TO YOU,KIDS WANNA ROCK and IT'S ONLY LOVE with Tina Turner. From 1983's CUTS LIKE A KNIFE is the title track and THIS TIME. From 1991's WAKING UP THE NEIGHBORS is EVERYTHING I DO and CAN'T STOP THIS THING WE STARTED. From 1987's INTO THE FIRE is HEAT OF THE NIGHT. PLEASE FORGIVE ME is the only original track. DO I HAVE TO SAY THE WORDS? is from WAKING UP THE NEIGHBORS and STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART is from CUTS LIKE A KNIFE. This album could have used ONE NIGHT LOVE AFFAIR from RECKLESS.
B00012QM8G|5.0|In \\"Schindler's List\\", Steven Speilberg surpassed even his formidable powers to create a moving, yet largely clear-eyed visualization of the Holocaust. Step-by distressing step Speilberg carefully portrays the Nazi's gradual destruction of the European Jews: from discrimination to ghettoization to incarceration and extermination.  And yet, the film is such a fully realized work, from its pacing, character development to the elegant black-and-white photography, that it is also, paradoxically, embracing - Speilberg shows you what a great director at the top of his powers can do with the film medium.  When I first saw it in 1993, I was both horrified and saddened by the content of the film but, also, in awe, thrilled even, that Speilberg had the courage to realize this brilliant historical recreation.  Rarely has a film been so evocative of an historical period different than the one in which it is made.  <br />Looking at the film now, I appreciate its subtlities better.  After an additional ten years of filmgoing, the violence in \\"Schindler's List\\" doesn't seem quite so overwhelming (its portrayal of human degradation does, however); in fact, Speilberg actually exercises admirable restraint throughout - he doesn't over-emphasize the cruelty of the Nazis to hammer home his points.  Liam Neeson's performance seems less wooden, now, and fuller; he makes wonderful use of his physique throughout and his transformation from war profiteer to hero doesn't seem as one-dimensional now as once it did.  Finally, for the things that Speilberg got wrong, like Neeson's final scene, crying that he could've saved \\"one more person\\" (one would think that, by that point in the film, Schinder's essential goodness wouldn't have to be emphasized), it's amazing how much Speilberg got right: all the little historical details and observations of family life.  The Jews themselves, who were criticized as being an indistinct mass of victims in this film, have actually come into greater focus andwe see now how skillfully Speilberg has intervowen the histories of a good half-dozen families within his larger narrative. <br />It's a great film but a less-than-desirable DVD.  I second all the \\"whining\\" about the double-sided disc - mine came in scratched too - and lack of extras.  I appreciated the documentary from the Shoah Foundation, but it would have been nice to have seen more the Schindler Jews who were prominent in the film. Also: Speilberg mentioned in interviews when the film was first released that he had an initial 4.5-hour cut of the film, I was really hoping that he would've restored this footage and brought out a \\"director's cut\\" edition rather than a gift-pack edition that is essentially all marketing paraphenilia wrapped around the same standard DVD.

B00005AQE8|5.0|This album is it. The first double album in rap history and a one time greatest selling rap album in America ( and therefore the world). This album has everything u need, ill beats, meaningful lyrics by Tupac the great, and immpresive guest appearances. This album clearly shows us that Tupac wasnt withering away in jail crying about his luck, and that he was calm and focused. The only sad thing about this is that he took it to Biggie on this album which is really unfortunate because they could have rocked the world.<BR>Best songs: How do U want it, Cali love, Only God can judge me, Heartz of Men, 2 of Americas Most Wanted and the underrated song Can't C me. (What the fu@k! make that the whole album playa)<BR>RIP to Tupac Makavelli the don, the boss of all bosses
1587990717|3.0|This is a good book; although not a great one. It is, though, a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone involved in the business of convincing others (and indeed themselves) of facts based on statistical &quot;evidence&quot;.<BR>Taleb is clearly a gifted thinker but I, as some other readers, couldn't help feeling annoyed by him before I reached the middle of the book. The last time I felt this uncomfortable was reading Michael Moore's last diatribe. Not that I disagreed  wholeheartedly with either of the writers' polemic; just that I felt the arguments were so heavily soaked in personal anger as to reduce the rational arguments to a one-sided shouting match.<BR>Taleb's clear failure to communicate to his colleagues and bosses says as much about Taleb's communication skills as it does of his acquaintances' foolishness.<BR>Sadly, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Taleb is not without foolishness himself in some of his spurious arguments (used to back up perfectly rational concepts). When he claims that if someone had invested 1 million dollars in the US stock market in the 1920's he would now effectively own the whole of the listed market we know he's not quite serious. Even assuming that the rest of the investors would sit quietly on the sidelines for 80 years, try finding someone in the 1920's with a million bucks to speculate!<BR>In terms of the foolishness of using past performance and past experiences to predict the future what other tool do we have?<BR>My understanding of the &quot;Bigger Fool Theory of Investing&quot; is that fundamentals are irrelevant to the future returns of an investment. While analysts may look at P/E ratios and capitalized values of companies and claim that the stock is fundamentally over-valued, what of a Cezanne?<BR>Many institutional investors hold works of art in their portfolios for the purpose of tax-efficient investment growth and diversification. Fundamentally, a Cezanne may be worth $50 US tops (and that's if you're prepared to pay current prices for the paint and canvas).<BR>There's nothing rational about paying US$49 million for a Cezanne....unless of course you can sell it to a &quot;bigger fool&quot; later for US$55 million.<BR>Mr Taleb's failing is that he leaves out the &quot;human nature&quot; side of making money (and being successful); success which can never be ascribed mathematically.  <BR>That being said, this book, though, despite the &quot;chip-on-shoulder&quot; tone of Mr Taleb (who incidentally, I suggest he goes out and, randomly, finds a nice supermodel to have a nice life with!)should be read.<BR>However, it can only be after you have consumed the excellent &quot;Against the Gods&quot; by Peter Bernstein.<BR>Oh, and Mr Taleb, don't overestimate our foolishness. Or if you do, don't tell us!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|good movie but confusing at some points. Once again, the visual effects are everything in the movie. Well not really but you know what I mean. You may want to watch this at a matenee or rent it on dvd but there are some things to like about the matrix revolutions. Like the sound and the special effects. Like I told you, the movie is quite confusing. I give it a B- and  2.5 out of 4 stars \\"**1/2\\"
0783225849|4.0|The Absence of color<br /> The movie Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock was filmed in the 1960's. It is a black and white horror film that is filled with suspense and a color that is not shown.  This was an excellent movie even though it was shot on a low budget and lack of color.  <BR>The movie starts out with two characters Marion Crane (Janet Lee) and her divorced lover Sam Loomis (John Gavin).  They are in a hotel room talking about how they wish they could be together and not have to meet in secret. Money problems keep them from being together.  Marion then gets her hands on $40,000, money she steals from her employer one afternoon rather than banking it. This is where things take a turn for the worse for Marion. She runs off with the money at the chance of being with the man she loves, but instead runs into Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).  Bates is the owner of Bates Motel, a secluded old motel that hasn't had many costumers in years.  When Marion comes along, things begin to twist in a new direction. The money does not seem like such a big deal with this twist in the plot. The second half of the movie consists of Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles), Sam, and a private investigator Mr. Arbogast (Martin Balsam) trying to find Marion. <BR> The movie was filmed in black and white. Even, though most of Hitchcock's films are in color. This black and white technique makes for a serious horror film.  The way that the film is portrayed with no color is useful in this horror film; by not having color makes the movie more intense and thrilling. The entire look of the movie is the same. The characters resemble each other differently even though they have different visual roles. The lack of color makes the intense scenes more exciting, as in the famous shower scene. The dark shadow of the killer coming near is used expertly, against the lightness of the bathroom; it disguises the character and leaves the viewers uncertain of whom the killer is.<BR> Compared to modern horror films that are in color Psycho displays Hitchcock's artistry through what we don't see.  When a character is shown covered in blood from either being the victim or finding the victim, the use of the red brings out a gory aspect to the movie.  This can be seen in the movie Scream. In the beginning of the movie, the killer strikes the high school girl and she is hanging from the tree outside. She is covered in blood and the redness that is shown on her clothing makes the scene horrifying to watch.  If this film were in black and white, this scene along with others in the movie would not have been so grotesque and at times unbearable to watch.  In Hitchcock's film we do not see this color of the red blood; this makes the viewer more interested in the plot rather than the color of the blood. <BR>Psycho being filmed in black and white helps with the suspense that the movie portrays.  A reoccurring theme in the movie are close ups of the eyes. When something was going to happen to one of the characters, the heart racing music would start and then there would be a shot of the characters eyes. The use of the black and white film makes the eyes look horrific, since there is no color present it gives off a dark and tense mood, the music helps portray this dark mood of the scene. The absence of color brings out a mysterious sense to the film like the close shots of the eyes. You did not know what to expect next. <BR> The fact that there was no color made the movie and scenes in the movie have a dark and tense mood. The shower scene is a helpful example, the shot of Marion's dark eyes was a striking way to end the scene and grab hold of the audience's attention and a curious transition as to what was going to happen next.  <BR> Psycho provides a thrilling, suspenseful mood with scenes that are unforgettable. <BR> The soundtrack is relentless and adds to this horror film.  This movie is different from other horror films these days; it's less predictable. You may think that some of the events that take place have something to do with the plot, but then find out that it has nothing to do with it at all. Those who like to watch movies that make you think and have you at the edge of your seat should see this film. After viewing the film you may be strangely left with the question what is normal in a colored world?
B0001AP12G|5.0|I will admit it, I didn't buy this cd the first day or week that it came out.  The reason why is because I have been burned many times by buying albums based on hype and come to find out that the albums were horrible.  With Kanye's album, I decided to try my luck based on the singles that he already had out.  I am really a fan of his production, so that made my decision easier.  This album is really really good in my opinion.  I can go through the entire album without skipping anything (yes even the skits).  All the songs on the album are good, but my most favorite songs are:<br />1. Never Let Me Down<BR>2. Jesus Walks<BR>3. Last Call<BR>4. Family Business<BR>5. Spaceship
B000005JA8|1.0|How in the world does this have a 3.5 star rating?  Someone must be artificially inflating it.  I should have known something was up when the spotlight review has more people voting against it than for it.  Oy, now what am I going to do with this album?  I can't even listen to one song all the way through without getting a headache.  Bah humbug.
006054094X|1.0|Gavin Menzies is a charming, seductive, inventive story teller, but his book is just an elaborate literary hoax, and belongs on the fiction list.<br />Gavin claims he has real, tangible evidence. Not true. Just check out for yourself some of the sources he cites. His own sources do not support the claims he makes.<br />For example, at pp 201-2(hardcover) Gavin writes of a pulley &quot;for hoisting sails&quot; found on the beach at Neahkahnie, Oregon, about 60 miles south of me. I drove down there and spoke with the curator of the Tillamook County Pioneer Museum. He had talked with Gavin in 2002 and Wayne told Gavin the pulley had already been carbon dated (in 1993) to 1590; and, the wax was beeswax for candles, prized and common cargo for the Spanish trade galleons that traveled between the Philippines and the west coast of North America, on a regular basis, between 1564 and 1815. The pulley was from one of those Manila galleons. In his book (page520) Gavin lists as a source &quot;Tales of the Neahkahnie Treasure&quot;, prepared by the Nehalem Valley Historical Society Treasure Committee, 1991, published by the Tillamook County Pioneer Museum. It clearly states (p5) the beeswax, not as Gavin states &quot;paraffin wax&quot; a hydrocarbon product, had been carbon dated to 1681. Further, a pollen study of the beeswax had revealed its source was northern Luzon in the Philippines where there was a certain variety of shrub the bees visited for pollen.<br />Gavin ignores the inconvenient facts, hides them from the reader, and writes as if he is just waiting for the lab to confirm the finding of some possible real Chinese evidence. It's not possible, as Gavin well knows, the lab work has long since been done and it does not fit his time frame. <br />For another example consider the Bimini road story. Gavin devotes a short chapter to this (pp265-277). The Bimini road is a long standing hoax in its own right. Gavin claims all the experts agree it is man made. Not true. He only cites one &quot;expert&quot;, David D. Zink, who was not a scientist, rather a former English teacher, a Cayce discple, intrigued with megalithic (big rock) structures and with the origins of myths. All the real experts know it is a natural geologic formation. Just by coincidence I noticed a timely article by Dr. Eugene A. Shinn, a geologist with USGS, in the Jan/Feb 2004 Skeptical Inquirer, pp38-44; &quot;Natural submerged beachrock off the island of Bimini in the Bahamas has been deemed a remmant of Atlantis by the faithful since the 1960s. In spite of geological research demonstrating the stones are natural, 'true believers' continue to be drawn by the strong 'force field'.&quot;  Take a look at that article and see if you can still believe the nonsense Gavin writes.<br />I could go on and on. Open any page and you will encounter nonsense. Gavin cites sources to be sure, but, if you take the time to read the claimed source material, you will invariably find it doesn't support what he writes. Gavin is desperate for some real, tangible evidence, and he simply ignores or misstates his own source material, and writes whatever he wishes, whatever he thinks may convince the reader his grand fantasy is true.<br />The book is a hoax and belongs on the fiction list.
0783225849|4.0|Psycho is unlike the thriller films of today's standards. Modern thriller films contain graphic murder scenes. Scaring the audience depends on how much blood, guts, and gore are involved. The movie scares the audience without the vivid gore. That reason is what makes Psycho known as a classic suspense film. Hitchcock's uses class in the making of the film. He makes the audience use their imagination instead of showing a detailed murder.<br />Vera Miles and Janet Leigh are the actresses Hitchcock chose for this movie. These female actresses are beautiful, yet sophisticated. Today's thriller films feature rather promiscuous looking teen girls. Having classy women acting in the film makes it refined.<br />The suspense used in Psycho makes it a classic film. It doesn't depend on the graphic murders that today's films use. The most graphic part of the famous shower scene is a flash of Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) stomach. The knife is never shown touching the skin. Although the murder takes place thirty minutes into the film, the suspense does not end. The search for Marion and the mystery of Mother keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Alfred Hitchcock lives up to his reputation as the \\"Master of Suspense\\" with this film.<br />Marion's love for Sam (John Gavin) drives her to steal forty thousand dollars from a client of her boss. She lands herself in an old, eerie motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). The forty thousand dollars serves as Hitchcocks' McGuffin in this film.<br />The mystery of Norman and Mother keeps the viewer in suspense. His outwardly nice appearance diminishes when the audience finds Norman watching Marion undress through a hole in the wall. The suspense begins building from here. After a nice meal and conversation with Norman, Marion realizes she set herself in a trap so she decides to fix her mistake. Marion decides to shower and go to sleep early in preparation for her long drive home. Her shower ends with her death, and Norman cleans up the mess. When the private investigator (Martin Balsam) is sent to Bates Motel to ask about Marion, Mother strikes again. Her facial features are never shown; this keeps the audience wondering not only what she looks like, but wondering what her motive is.<br />Hitchcock explored cinematography in Psycho. Hitchcock used specific camera angles to hide the mystery of Norman's mother. After the private investigator and Sam stop by the hotel to search for Marion, Norman moves mother to the basement. The birds-eye camera angle is used so that only the top of her head and body is seen as Norman carries her. When victims are being killed, Mother is usually seen from behind. When her face is shown, Hitchcock uses shadows to make sure her facial features were obscured. <br />Alfred Hitchcock's techniques in filming Psycho make it a classic thriller film. By not using blood and gore he allows the audience to use their imagination in murder scenes. His choices of actresses add to the sophistication of the film. It's classic because the suspense continues to build even after the murder scenes are completed. It does not rely on murder to make the audience frightened.
0385504209|5.0|If you don't think for yourself, don't bother with this intellectually and spiritually challenging work by Dan Brown.  This book is an highly provocative mind-opener, so you really have to be a courageous, free-thinking person  in order to really get into it and explore new territory.  It throws into question many of our comfortable traditions and truisms, our cherished and well-defended beliefs and practices(like going to church every Sunday and trusting the cliches coming from the pulpits above us).  I believe that this novel is a landmark on our journey toward greater self-awareness and freedom of intellectual exploration- but you have to be gutsy enough to shed a lot of mental baggage and inherited illusions to get there.  If you want to be brave and expand your consciousness, read this work. If you want to remain a sheep amongst the flock with the same color of wool over your eyes, then do not even venture into the first chapter. It will shake you to the foundations of your uncritical thought. Stay where you are. Pray. Smooze. Follow the dicta and the routines of your Church. The pure sunlight out here in Dan Bown-land can be blinding, especially for sheep.
038572179X|5.0|An amazing book. Wonderful writing. It has been weeks since I finsihed it, and I am still thinking about it. I have recommneded it to everyone I know.  Once you finish, you will grow to love it more and more!  Breathtaking!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I have enjoyed Bill Murray's work over the years.  I haven't always LOVED it, but he can always make me laugh.  My favorite is \\"Ground Hog Day.\\"      I was interested in seeing this movie because of the things that I heard about Murray and this role.  I heard that he portrayed a character who was deep and that the movie was meaningful.  I was prepared for a bit of \\"artsiness,\\" and I was prepared to like Bill Murray if not the entire film.  I figured - with the Academy Award nomination and all - he must have broken new ground and stretched his acting range.    Well, I failed to enjoy the movie and found Bill Murray almost unrecognizable as a human being.  Perhaps the movie was about how shallow many people are.  Perhaps it was about how difficult it is to maintain a marriage, to get older, to be deeply bored, to have a mediocre career, to think you made a big mistake, to experience selfless love.  Maybe it is about how an unlikely, inconsequential meeting of two people can almost ruin two families.      Any of these seem like plausible themes.  However, there was almost no character development and almost no plot.  My guess is that the director had too little maturity and life experience to make a credible point through these characters in this situation.  As a result, I will never know what this movie was trying to do.  Furthermore, I'll probably forget all about the whole thing as soon as I hit the save button for this review.
B00009ATIX|1.0|I enjoy science fiction movies.  I have always like George Clooney's acting ability.  I thought this movie was going to be great.  After all, George Clooney is in it.  While my friends fell asleep, I stopped myself from falling asleep because it has to get better because George Clooney is in the movie.  It never does get better.  I dont know even though how to begin to describe this movie.  It was the most bizarre movie I have ever seen in my life.  When my friends woke up, they asked me about the ending.  I told them that I dont even know how to begin to describe it.  I asked them if they wanted me to rewind it.  They all say at the same time, never mind.  I should have rented Ocean's Eleven.  He was good in that.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I'll start by saying that I did not like this movie. I was ready to stop watching it after 30 minutes but stuck it out to the end. Mostly, what I appreciate in a movie is good writing. Acting and cinema photography help but, in my opinion, cannot carry a movie. The nighttime photography was rather compelling but it made me want to visit Tokyo about as much as Potterville (which it rather resembled.)<BR>This just might have made a good book, however. The thoughts and feelings of the three primary characters could have been presented (in a book) in such a way that the reader would have a different impression of them than was obtained from the movie: indifference. I neither liked nor disliked any of the main characters and felt no more involved in their lives than I would to the guy next to me at the airport after having listened to one end of his cell phone conversation.<BR>This book/movie comparison works both ways. One of my all-time favorite books is &quot;Catcher in the Rye.&quot; I have felt like I have known Holden Caufield all of my life. It would, however, make a horrible movie.<BR>&quot;Translation,&quot; (as a movie) in my opinion, had the makings of a good story. As I see it, it completely failed. I would be very interested to see it written as a novel.
B000066C87|1.0|I enjoy britcoms.  It was so differcult to understand the english dialog in this movie.  The accent was just too thick.  There was so many subplots going on during the movie.  It took about an hour and fifteen minutes for the murder to occur.  My friends and I drifted in and out of sleep during the movie.  I have never before slept during a movie until I saw this one.  Believe me, none of cared who the murderer was.  Much less why the character was murdered.  If you want to watch a riveting murder mystery, then dont buy this movie.  If you have trouble sleeping, then buy this movie.
0385510438|5.0|This is so much better than the last few of John Grisham's books. I loved all the characters, especially Miss Callie. This is a must read for Grisham fans and those who aren't yet. Very, very good.
B00018D44U|5.0|I have never heard of someone purchasing a CD from someone, hoping that this one will be better (since you're disappointment is &quot;without words&quot;). I normally won't buy another from the same artist. This is a really great CD, and having your review posted on the same page with true music lovers is a waste of web space. I truly recommend this CD and if you have your doubts, just listen to the sample links....enjoy!
B0001AP158|5.0|This is a definite must have for any Bon Jovi fan. It is by far one of the best concerts i have ever seen or heard. The sound is great the color and clarity is awesome. I have been a Bon Jovi fan for around 10 or 11 years now and will admit i've never heard them sound as good as they do on here. It is some of there best songs stripped down to simple form as they give you an intimate look into them. Bon Jovi has not lost anything in the 20 some odd years they have been together. As I said before a definite must have for any fan.
B00008PW2D|5.0|...>I have seen worse and anyway, Season 5 might have its flaws but it's not THAT bad.<br />The only thing I hate about all the releases are the stupid, unpractical keep cases. They look cheapish and they do not protect the discs properly (dust can get inside the case, etc) and it is a pain to get the discs out.<br />But anyway, I will always love Sex and the City forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This isn't a review of the movie, just a warning about the DVD.  FIVE MINUTES OF ADVERTISING THAT CANNOT BE SKIPPED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  In other words, every time that I will watch a movie that I love, I will start out angry.
B000002UJQ|5.0|On first listen, you just realize this is an album without symmetry, without easily recognizable hooks that reach out and grab you...you hear long, flowing melodies, odd rhythms, extremely complex structures and textures, layers upon layers of chimey, distorted, clean, and acoustic guitars, glitched digital effects, a piece recited by a cold, creepy computer voice while someone plays a distant echoey piano, jagged, unpredictable chord changes....then after a few listens it sinks in, and you just sit there and bask in it's gloriously odd beauty.  The hooks are there, they are just so subtle that they implant themselves deep in your mind before you even know they're there.(...) Beatlesque, ....[i doubt 'Karma Police' would have sounded out of place on 'Magical Mystery Tour.'] but totally original...tinged with psychedelia yet thoroughly fresh sounding.  This is a great album by a great band....Radiohead at their height.  I love Thom Yorkes moody lyrics...at times spiteful: 'When i am king you will be fast against the wall...'  at times cheeky:  'Karma Police, arrest this girl, her hitler hairdo is making me feel ill...' (...)  Brilliant...their masterpiece.
B00005JM02|4.0|I didn't think anything could top the original Toy Story, but this movie just made it. The gags in this movie are hellarious, features some of the best computer animation ever put on film, and a heartwarming story that only a true grouch coudln't appreciate. I guess the rest is self explanitory. See this movie.
B000067CPX|5.0|Let me start by saying what a great album. This cd has everything! From slower ballad type songs, which are awesome, to louder rock type songs like Minor Thing, this cd has it.<BR>   The cd starts with the title song By the Way, which starts slow and swings to fast guitars and powerful lyrics. The song Universally Speaking comes next, and that is a very great song. To be honest I enjoyed every song on this cd in one way or another.<BR>   My favorite songs on this cd are: Dosed, I Could Die For You, Midnight, Tear, and Venice Queen is great. I have listened to this entire cd at least 20 times.         <BR>   If you have an open mind, and don't just enjoy the Red Hot Chili Peppers Funk-Rap then you should enjoy this. I definitely enjoyed this cd and hope you will as well.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This morning I heard someone tell a co-worker not to bother to<BR>see this awful movie about nothing, with no ending.<BR>So I had to check amazon reviews to see if anyone else had loved it like I did. It looks like the people who loved it, had explained it perfectly. <BR>It is not for someone who prefers a less subtle movie -<BR>action films, or the in-your-face style comedy of the Farrelly Bros. Some movie watchers don't want to translate, they want the point to be obvious. We thought this movie was touching, magical, funny and sweet. A reviewer said it best - it makes you feel something you haven't been able to put into words.  My husband and I didn't want the movie to end, we had become so involved with the chemistry of these two people. <BR>Obviously not for everyone.
B000003TA4|5.0|This cd came out in possibly the greatest year in music. This year brought you new music for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and of course Nirvana. This cd shows you how great music can be when it's done right.<BR>   From the mega hit opening song Smells Like Teen Spirit to the slower Something in the Way closing this cd is very solid. What I really enjoy about this cd is that I can listen to it every day and never get tired of it.<BR>   In my opinion the best songs are: In Bloom, Lithium, Territorial Pissings, Drain You, and On a Plain. When I bought this cd, I immediatly fell in love with it, and I think you will too.
0671027344|5.0|This book was amazing. It is about a freshman named Charlie who is having trouble fitting in to his everyday life, since his aunt died and his best friend committed suicide. It is the story of how he learns to deal. It is much more open and raw than any novel though. This story is made up of letters that Charlie writes to an anonymous character. Charlie is so genuine, caring, and real, that I assure you that you will fall in love with him as well as this book.
B000002LQR|3.0|Ok, I know practically everybody that enjoys the Chili Peppers says that this is their best cd. But, in my opinion, they are dead wrong. This cd is good at some points, but bad on a lot of points. <BR>   Maybe, I am being a little rough on them, but I fill that all this cd is is them talking about genitalia, and what not. It has some songs on it, like My Lovely Man, where I just stopped and said, &quot;what the f*** is this?&quot;<BR>   I haven't actually listened to this cd in about a year though, so I will give it another chance. In closing I'll say not their best, but still a respectable cd.

B00000J7JO|5.0|This was the first Chili Peppers cd I got. It was given to me on my 13th birthday 3 years ago, and it was my favorite gift. I think its a great cd but like some of the songs way more that others.<BR>   The reason I originally wanted this cd was for Scar Tissue, and Otherside. But, when I listened to it I realized it didn't only have two good songs. If you listened to this cd you will probabley know what I mean.
B000002LCE|4.0|Hey guys.  Has anyone else noticed that when you look at the word &quot;Dio&quot; on the front cover upside-down, it resembles the word &quot;Devil&quot;?  Anyways, this is a great disc by a great artist.  I would consider Dio to be a Metal God.  Check out his album &quot;Holy Diver&quot; if you don't know his music.
B00003CX5P|2.0|That 'The Phantom Menace' was a bit of a letdown isn't exactly news to anyone.  What I think is surprising, however, is the lasting impact this half-baked prequel has had on the collective psyche of fans and followers alike.  It was all renewed for me while watching the new Simpsons episode last night which, out of left field, spent about 15 minutes making fun of 'Cosmic Wars,' 'Jim Jam Bongs' and their midget-like creator, a faux Lucas.  Bart and Lisa even go so far as to break in to the fake Lucas' workplace to convey their criticism of his lackluster work.  Obviously some sort of catharsis for some Simpsons writers, the episode simply showed that what many of us suspected from the onset is now likely to prove true:  The Phantom Menace will always be the ugly stepchild in the Star Wars family.  One had hoped that over time, with reflection and further perspective, this film could have aged somewhat gracefully and it, warts and all, could have been accepted.  Doesn't seem likely now, since it just serves to embody all the frantic CGI ugliness and consumerism that severely damaged Return of the Jedi, Attack of the Clones, and the horrid revisionist 'Special Edition' originals.  The cure for this malady is the word 'no', which should be applied liberally in Lucas' brainstorming sessions.  Here are some of the many Phantom Menace errors that could have been corrected with such a simple phrase:<br />Anakin is Jesus.<br />The Force is not mystical so much as derived from tiny little parasites.<br />Physical comedy works best when telegraphed several minutes in advance.<br />Amphibian sidekicks work best when used on desert planets.<br />Ships and technology from a previous decade are far more advanced than in later years, and all somehow magically vanish.<br />Queens/princesses are elected.<br />Assassins are always confused when a Queen and handmaiden switch places (this happens AGAIN in Attack of the Clones)<br />Goofy droid soldiers are more compelling than armored stormtroopers.<br />It is important to indoctrinate 6 year olds to the films rather than appease their decrepit 25 year old forebears.  This means more shiny things; less plot, dialogue, and acting.<br />To all of these things, history appears to be serving up a resounding 'No.'BR>It is important to indoctrinate 6 year olds to the films rather than appease their decrepit 25 year old forebears.

B00005JN1L|4.0|This was a pretty good movie,though I was expecting it to be better.The first hour and a half or so, it was very good and suspenseful,but in the last 20 minutes, it just gets really weird and the style of the movie seems to change all of a sudden.The ending reminded me of an ending to another movie that came out a few months ago but I won't mention what it is in case I give away the ending for this movie.Overall, this was a pretty good thriller,but it gets pretty strange towards the end.
B000002TQV|5.0|This album is a perfectly crafted piece of art. OK Computer is only slightly less perfect in my mind because of &quot;Fitter, Happier&quot;. This album runs perfectly from beginning to end and it isn't an album which'll make you skip tracks. I would compare this album to The Joshua Tree by U2. The hits off this album are also wonderful. &quot;High and Dry&quot;, &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, &quot;Just (You Do It To Yourself&quot;, and &quot;Street Spirit (fade.out)&quot; are all fantastic singles and one of those songs alone makes this album worth owning. But together those songs and the other songs make this an essential album.
0060987464|5.0|This biography is one of the most interesting books I have ever read, and this is coming from a guy who normally doesn't read books. It was interesting to read about Manson and Trent Reznor recording at the Sharon Tate house and his views on various things. Also has lots of great pictures of Brian Warner as a kid. Once you start reading this, you can't put it down.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice has a beautiful Irish tenor voice. And it works wonderfully in his folk aranged album. He also has a female companion who harmonizes with him, and she is a fantastic vocalist. This album is composed of guitar, the two vocalists, some percussion, and generally a cello or small strings arrangement. That makes for a wonderful album to listen and relax to.<BR>The song-writing on the album is amazing. Rice writes songs like conversations and uses the wonderful (and beautiful if you've seen the video) female to sing the response. Many songs are about lost love or bad love or just love, but they are not just simple, stupid, pop love songs. They are incredibly crafted lyrics that can stand alone without music, which says a lot about Rice's songwriting skills.<BR>Buy this album if you enjoy folk/pop music. James Taylor, Angie Aparo, Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Gark Jules and David Gray are a few musicians I would say if you like you'll enjoy Damien Rice.
B0000AMJED|5.0|What a great movie. Everyone told me about this movie but i never thought of it this way... the movie is great for teenage BOYZ... Maybe GIRLZ will think its a stupid. If you love cars JUST watch this movie.. But my mom liked it!!! :D
B00009IEDC|2.0|It is amazing how many awards one can win by writing one song!<br />When the album appeared in my local music shop, I listened to it instantly. Something, the name, the cover intrigued me. But like with so many other albums, only a couple of songs caught my ear, so I did not want to waste my money on it. Life is too short - and my music collection already far too big - for so-so music.<br />But now, a few months later, it seems like I bump into the band (not literally) and its music constantly. For example when I was in Vejle for a conference a few weeks ago and got to my hotel room, switched on the television (by curiousity as I don't have one at home myself) and stumbled over the totally rubbish programme 'Danish Music Awards'. Evanescence again. The band was given the award for best foreign album or something. [But did, understandably, not show up!]<br />Back in Luxembourg where I live, I therefore took the opportunity to borrow 'Fallen' from the Record Club, as it had after all been re-intriguing me.<br />But what IS the fuss?! The only special thing about Evanescence's music is lead singeress Amy Lee's voice. It is emotional and kinda sexy, and she sings pretty well. But after two songs (no, not half a CD, but two songs!) I was tired of it. The voice, the music... Evanescence.<br />It IS amazing... this band has written one song - the hit 'Bring Me To Life', which I in fact find a pretty good piece of nu-rock - and then made it into an album by copying it 8 times and adding the two obligatory ballads. Which are not particularly inspired either. So much for shooting stars.<br />And for that they get overloaded with awards. I don't get it. Evanescence basically sounds like an aftermath of Linkin Park, only with a female singer. Writes one song. Records it ninefold. And sell zillions.<br />I do not get it.<br />Me, I grant the album two stars out of five.<br />So much for shooting stars.
0385504209|4.0|Annotation: A mysterious Death takes place at a famous art museum. The French Police are convinced that the killer is Robert Langdon, which gets him involved in finding the killer himself. After a sequence of events he learns who the true killer is and the reason he killed the famous curator of the art museum.<br />Author bio:Dan Brown is the author of many bestselling novels. His novels have been translated and published in 40 different languages. Dan is the son of a math professor and a professional sacred musician. Dan's wife, Blythe, is an art historian and painter who helps with his research and goes on reasearch trips with him.<br />Evaluation: This was a good book. The keyword being good. It was an entertaining book and kept me wanting to read more, most of the time. At parts, the book was extremely boring and I wanted nothing more that to put the book down. But then it would get interesting agin. One thing that really irritated me about the book was the way it seemed to preach to me and it had a lot of information that really wasnt needed. I found myself skipping over many pages and picking up again and still I knew and understood what was happening in the book. The last few chapters make of the book were incredibly awesome. they made the book compltely worth sticking with and worth reading. If you're into mysterious thrillers that keep you guessing, or if you are in the mood to read a historical fiction book with good factual information than this is a book for you.

B0001932ZA|3.0|I am writing this review to rate The Running Man. It's Arnold. It's action-adventure. It's entertaining!!! Nothing in this film to change the social conscious of America or inspire great literary works but who wants that in their boom-boom bang-bang films. The look of the film was, on a whole, dark and sweaty. The music caught my attention as being an odd score for a film of this nature but has a memorable theme. Arnold does another good job and kicking that a$$ and then piling on a one liner or two. Maria Conchita Alonso is a beautiful woman and gives a solid performance. Seeing them together harkens to a Total Recall vibe. Yaphet Kotto of ALIEN fame is on board for a supporting role and Jesse \\"The Body\\" Venture and Jim Brown shine in rolls of stalkers on the maniacal gameshow. Richard Dawson makes a dominating persona of the Running Man's host. Entertaining while leading you to believe he is one of the bad guys without any hint of \\"acting\\" like a bad guy. The plot has a general feel of Escape from New York. Paul Michael Glaser of Starsky and Hutch TV fame does a fine job of directing this film, coming on board after the first director separated from the project. Some unique shooting angles and motion shots in this one. The reason I give an overall rating of 3 stars is due to this two disc set being spiced up with several Extra Features that are NO FEATURES! The best of the 3 main extras is Meet The Stalkers, a review of the characters that hunt Ben Richards(Arnold). Game Theory tries to relate modern reality shows to the Running Man gameshow and does a poor pr job for the modern shows(Survivor, etc.) clarifying that many participants of these not-so-real \\"reality\\" shows are prompted and directed, while many scenarios in the shows are forced upon the participants to draw reactions desired by the creators. How real is that? Lastly...I am OUTRAGED that the Lockdown on Main Street feature, alleged to be a documentary about current national security issues in the post9/11 world, is really a liberal political statement. I paid my money for this item to be ENTERTAINED/informed and not lectured about how the government, particularly the current administration, is out to rob US citizens of their rights. How this directly relates to the plot is vague at best(the government runs the TV network that airs Running Man show and controls the network/Dawson). A debate over how far the government works in controlling TV and it's effect on the viewing masses would have been tolerable, even if remotely relevant to the film. This feature far exceeded that scenario and simply portrayed elements of the government as wanting to invade American homes by using backlash from 9/11 as the excuse. I DID NOT buy this DVD to be told how I should think!!! Show me a movie and make me laugh/cry/jump/pump my fist. Don't feed me PROPAGANDA for YOUR cause. I find it humourous that the government is made to be a villian, being in control of the fictional violence-rich TV show, when the current administration is from a party that is usually leading the effort to control the language/violence/sexuality on the airwaves of this nation while being opposed by cries of CENSORSHIP from the other side. Wouldn't this DVD have been better served with extra features that actually relate to the movie/cast/crew??? Poor decision making on REPUBLIC PICTURES and ARTISAN HOME ENTERTAINMENT for producing this release when it could have been more ENTERTAINING to have an interview or two with Arnold, Jesse, Maria or Yaphet(none of them appear anywhere in the extras) and SHAME on them for attempting to make politics out of a good/entertaining film.
0783225849|4.0|Director Alfred Hitchcock's movie, \\"Psycho\\" kept me at the edge of my seat throughout this classic thriller. Although the movie is in black and white, Hitchcock uses other special effects to add excitement. Not only that, but his wise choice of actors made the film that much more enjoyable. They portrayed the characters just as Hitchcock wanted them to. At the beginning of the movie, the plot is shifted in many directions. Hitchcock did an extraordinary job adding many twists into the story. \\"Psycho\\" is a famous, classical horror movie that will be a popular movie for many years to come.<BR>     Hitchcock knew what he was doing when he chose the characters that he did.  Anthony Perkins, who played Norman Bates, used the perfect facial expressions and tone of voice to keep you guessing his innocence or guilt. When the investigator comes to his tiny, in-the-middle-of-nowhere hotel looking for Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), Perkins is nervous and stutters a lot. This suspicion leads you to believe he might have something to do with the disappearance of Marion, but in your head you're portraying Perkins as this nice, innocent hotel owner with great hospitality. Throughout the movie in many different scenes, Perkins uses very meaningful, evil, and friendly facial expressions that especially play out Bates' character. When Bates' is watching Marion through the window, you get the feeling that Bates' has something evil planned, but murder is not what jumped to my head right away. <BR>     Janet Leigh was another great actress for Hitchcock's film. She is a petite, vulnerable character that is marvelous for the role of a devious, suspicious blonde on the run with $40,000. I think Hitchcock knew what he was doing when he asked Leigh to be in his movie. It adds a whole other twist to the storyline. <BR>     The special effects make the movie outstanding all by themselves. One thing that really stands out in my mind is the soundtrack. The music adds to the horror and suspense ofit all. Hitchcock selected music that terrifies you even if you weren't even looking at the screen. It really draws you into the scene like you're witnessing things firsthand.<BR>     Throughout the movie, the lighting and camera angles draw you in even more. Hitchcock uses outstanding shadows on the faces of the characters, and adds a dark, eerie glow to the dark nights at Bates' Motel. I especially liked the camera angles during the shower scene. Hitchcock zooms in really close, once again inviting the audience to be a part of the scene.<BR>     At the beginning of the movie, Marion Crane is with her boyfriend Sam, at a cheap motel over their lunch break. Unable to get married because Sam is still paying alimony to his ex-wife, Marion is drawn in to the perfect opportunity: She is trusted with $40,000 in which her boss orders her to take it to the bank at the end of the day. Instead, Marion flees the town to Sam's home in another town.<BR>     Tired from driving almost all through the night in a heavy rainstorm, Marion sees a hotel off the main highway and decides to stop. Here, she meets Norman Bates, the owner of the hotel. Being the nice hotel clerk that he appears to be, Norman offers Marion a late supper. She complies, and patiently waits for his return. In the meantime, she overhears Norman in an argument with his mother. This adds yet another twist in Hitchcock's film. After dinner, Marion tells Norman she wants to get cleaned up and get a good night's sleep, so he leaves, only to return later, leaving the audience in total shock after what comes next....<BR>     I think \\"Psycho\\" is an excellent horror film that will scare many viewers right out of the shower after watching it. Its constant mysteries and plot twists keep you thinking all the time. Although it may be quite gruesome, Hitchcock's film remains on my list for scariest movies of all time!
B00005JM1F|4.0|I know, I know, the plot for this film has been rehashed from &quot;Animal House&quot; and countless other college debauchery flicks, but so what?  OLD SCHOOL is a hilarious romp of scintillating and titillating proportions, a 90-minute mad dash of sight gags, crude one-liners, and tongue-in-cheek zaniness.  If college fraternities were really like this I never would have left academia (well, I did have my own &quot;eight-year-plan,&quot; but that's another story).<br />Three thirtysomething buddies (Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell) decide to revitalize their lives by cranking up a college fraternity whose members are not required to be students at the local university.  Of course, such a blasphemous act draws the ire of the college's administrators (insert &quot;Animal House&quot; plot here), and accordingly, the fledgling frat must do battle with the corrupt, unscrupulous establishment.  Sure, this ground's been covered before in countless other movies, but OLD SCHOOL adds its own loony spin of mayhem--from concrete blocks tied to fragile appendages, to eye-opening mud wrestling.<br />While OLD SCHOOL's cast, from top to bottom, is excellent, Will Ferrell dominates this film (much like Dangerfield in &quot;Caddyshack,&quot; or Belushi in &quot;Animal House&quot;).  As Frank &quot;the Tank&quot; Ricard, a newlywed with a party animal mentality, Ferrell's over-the-top antics are bust-a-gut, roll-on-the-floor funny.  Ferrell, whether he's streaking or performing a gymnastics floor exercise, carries this film like a fullback with a football.<br />If in fact we equate entertainment with escapism (which I do), OLD SCHOOL delightfully fits the bill.  You'll forget the problems of the day with this puppy, and you'll have fun in the process.<br />--D. Mikels
B00004VWA7|5.0|This is the greatest bass player of all time's first solo album. I LOVE Flea a lot and he is the master of slapping but I have to say Jaco takes it all in terms of quality and control.  What I hated is on the Flea message boards where people shredded Flea and said Cliff Burton was the real bass genious, NO! not true at all, Cliff just used distortion and wah to hide his sound, he never played anything big and true like Flea and Jaco did. Cliff burton was in Metallica! METALLICA! That tells you he can't be that great.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|But then I guess it's so important that we get three more trashy reality shows about useless idiots. Anyway, This show is excellent and the dvd's are well done. I watched it when it was on, but I have to say that the dvd's were more enjoyable for me because the episodes were in order, which they were not when they were aired. Unsurprisingly, they make more sense in order and there were quite a few subtleties that I missed the first time that were very clear once the story lines were unbroken. Add to that the cow smuggling scenes are now contiguous - much better. <br />The cast is incredible. I don't really think there's a lot that can be said otherwise, but the acting was excellent. Fans of Joss' other work can catch several guest actors that also appeared on Buffy and Angel. Speaking of which, the writing, as one comes to expect from Joss Whedon's projects, was vastly entertaining with that extra bit of flair and surprise that he does so well. He balances humor and drama like no one else. <br />As to the dvd's themselves, the extras are great including the gag real that was cut for the cast Christmas party that ended up being the wrap party (oh, the unfairness!) and a taped audition by Alan Tudyk (Wash). The comentary is hilarious and interesting (not commentary for the blind viewers), and there is a lot of it. Joss himself provides commentary for several episodes, as do many of the actors. Aside from great behind the scenes stories and clever banter, you really get a sense of what it was like to make this show and that for the cast and crew it was a real labor of love. I was sad to see that Ron Glass (Shepherd Book) did not provide any commentary, but you can't have everything.<br />The show was experimental in many ways, including some cutting edge effects stuff, for instance computer generated scenes made to look as though they were shot through a hand held camera. Unfortunately, not everyone appreciates innovation and a good story line. I do have to say thoughthat if I don't find out what was really going on there with all the mulitple meta-plots and teasing hints, I will never forgive Joss &amp; co.

6300275213|5.0|This movie was truly entertaining.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  I laughed throughout and couldn't be more pleased with the preformances given by Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah (not to mention the others playing smaller parts).  The story line may be far fetched as it does involve a mermaid, and a &quot;mad scientist&quot; but I feel this is one of the reasons this movie is so endearing.  I would recommend this one to anyone looking for a good laugh, and a bit of romance.
B000089RVX|5.0|Yes, this is the best album of this genre ever. I would say it's the best album ever, if I wasn't afraid to be too bold and too unfair to other music genres I never hear (pop and country). It's been almost a year since I've bought it and still haven't grown bored of it. And those who thought \\"Bring Me to Life\\" was good, then go, go and get the album! Every thing else on this album is simply... I don't normally use the term \\"kick ass\\" but I'll make an exception this time, this album \\"....\\". <BR>I'm the type of person who listens to a song, and buys the single, for the sole reason that I never like the whole album. Ever. And think its a waste of my money to buy the whole thing. This is the first time I get an album and love every single single on it, Amy Lee.... what can I say, her voice is beautiful *and* sexy, it is mesmerizing and hypnotic, inspiring beyond measure. If I could compare her to someone else, I would have, but nothing could possibly compare to her. To be on target: GET THE ALBUM!!! GET IT and get it NOW.... It's worth every freaking penny!
6302787068|5.0|This was a movie that could easily be called a typical Disnay animated movie.  Most of the time &quot;typical&quot; is not a discripter used when writing a rave review about a film, but when in this case it works well.  A typically Disney film is always enjoyable and this is no exception.  This is a light hearted romance that revolves around the story of Aladdin and his magic lamp.  As an adult I still enjoy watching this film with my young son.  Both my son and I laughed hysterically at the Genie who stole the show, but I wouldn't have expected anything less from a Robin Williams preformance.  I would most certainly recommend this film to anyone.
B000002H97|4.0|Coming off of what was arguably their masterpiece, in ...And Justice For All, Metallica decided to make a more mainstream oriented album. Their self-titled fifth studio album, also known as The Black Album, is just that. This point is emphasized by the fact that five singles were released for the album. Still, the album is a very good one, although quite different from the band's first four, as it is less of a metal album, and more of a hard rock one. It was also the beginning of the end for Metallica in the eyes of many, as the band turned to much softer pop metal after this album. However, all surrounding the album aside, it's a very good album, with some classic Metallica songs. <br />These include &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, the band's most famous song, which despite suffering from being overplayed, is a great energetic song with great guitar riffs, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, Metallica's best ballad, which would unfortunately be crapped on six years later when Metallica released the terrible &quot;Unforgiven II&quot; on their album Reload. Still, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; is a great display of James Hetfield's less thrashy, more emotional vocal style that had previously only really been seen on the Ride The Lightning ballad &quot;Fade To Black&quot;. Then there's &quot;Of Wolf And Man&quot;, which sounds as much like a song from the earlier days as any on TBA and &quot;My Friend Of Misery&quot;, which has beautiful guitar riffs, just as much as it does great vocals. Of course, the album has its cons as well. &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot;, &quot;Don't Tread On Me&quot;, &quot;The God That Failed&quot; and &quot;The Struggle Within&quot; are all, to say the least, forgettable. &quot;Sad But True&quot; is better known for having it's riff used in Kid Rock's big hit American Badass than it is for itself, which is unfortunate, since it's a good song, and in true Kid Rock fashion, American Badass is not. &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; are the album's other two songs, both of which were released as singles, and both are good but not great songs. &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; being an energetic, guitar driven rocker, and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; being a beautiful acoustic ballad, which, despite being a nice song, is not on the same level as the masterpiece that is &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;. <br />Dismissing The Black Album as pop just because it was Metallica's most commercially successful album is a very stupid thing to do. The album was the only good thing Metallica did in the 90's, and is the band's most accessible album that is worth listening to. It's a great place to start if you're interested in getting into Metallica, and although not their best, a solid album that's worth picking up.
0385504209|3.0|I've read a few reviews on this book and I think the overall average review for this book is pretty accurate.  This book reads pretty fast, which is good.  For those who didn't get pass the 2/3rd mark you were smart.  The ending, as usual for Dan Brown, was disappointing.  I just have 1 word, &quot;Hollywood.&quot;  After reading Angels &amp; Demons and Da Vinci Code I have to say that's the last of Dan Brown for me...unless he kills off Robert Langdon.  Of course, if the anti-matter, the Hassassin, or any of the secret frats couldn't kill the little nerd I don't think anything or anyone else could...except Mr. Brown himself.  The one bright spot was this book was an improvement over Angels &amp; Demons.
B000002H33|5.0|Before Metallica turned to radio friendly hard rock, they had perfected the genre of heavy metal. Master of Puppets is Metallica's third album of a career that had already had an impact at this point. Kill `Em All, the band's debut, created the genre of thrash metal, and would be copied for years to come. Ride the Lightning, their sophmore effort, showed tremendous growth and maturity, as well as produced one of the best heavy metal instrumentals ever created (\\"Call of Ktulu\\"). However, they showed us that there was still room for improvement with their classic third album. <br />James Hetfield's lyrics were one of the strongest points on Ride the Lightning, as he was blooming as a lyricist by this point. Hetfield's lyrics are strong once again on Puppets, but what makes it so much better than Lightning or anything that came after it is the music. Containing four excellent musicians at this point, they seemingly could do no wrong here. \\"Orion\\", the instrumental featured on here, is proof of this. Based around Cliff Burton's outstanding bass work, James Hetfield delivers some of his best riffs ever, while Kirk Hammett's soaring lead guitar just gives it even more punch. It's not too badly composed either. The part near the middle where it comes to a stop and goes to a great interlude has to be one of the greatest Metallica moments ever. No track on this album manages to beat \\"Orion\\", but they all come damned close. \\"Battery\\" goes from a mellow acoustic intro to a Kill `Em All esque thrash song. While not one of the best on here, it's got great energy and sets the pace for the rest. The thrashier version of Metallica also appears on the album's closer, the violent \\"Damage Inc.\\" On the opposite end of things, there are some slower songs here as well. \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" is driven by ultra-heavy riffs and Hetfield's eerie lyrics, based on a story by H.P. Lovecraft. \\"Leper Messiah\\" is the other song of this variety, and like it's counterpart is highly riff based. This one has a very addictive melody and an impressive guitar solo. Then there's also \\"Disposable Heroes\\", which is probably the weakest song on here, but that's not to say it isn't great. Just a little less great. Like \\"One\\" on the follow up to Puppets, ...And Justice For All, \\"Disposable Heroes\\" is a song about war, and may be the most sinister song on here. It has a great chorus though, and is certainly worthy of it's place on this classic album. The other two songs are the title track, which is one of Metallica's finest accomplishments in every way, and is up there with \\"Orion\\" and \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" as possibly being the best song on here. The other is \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\". Ride the Lightning featured the first Metallica ballad, in the heartbreaking \\"Fade To Black\\". \\"Sanitarium\\" is inferior to their previous album's masterpiece, but still has a great melody, great lyrics (which, obviously enough, deal with insanity), and an outstanding louder part towards the end where the band goes all-out as only they can. <br />This is the quintessential metal album. If you have decided that you hate Metallica, or heavy metal as a genre, but haven't heard this, your opinion is invalid. Metallica couldn't possibly top this album ever, but they were at least able to come close to matching it with the follow-up. This album got me into Metallica, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. A must-hear for all music fans.
B000002LPH|5.0|I don't own the CD of this album. I bought the vinyl back when it came out in the late '70s and lost it. Recently my brother died and his whole huge record collection was left behind. I brought it down and found four of Harrison's albums in it, including this one. It was a revelation, after nearly 25 years, to listen to the vinyl recording again. How well it stands up! Practically every cut is remarkable. My favorite is &quot;Your Love is Forever,&quot; which is truly beautiful, with the guitar &quot;chimes&quot; just echoing glassily over the chords and vocals. It's one of the most beautiful songs Harrison ever did, though there is much to choose from on this album. Sometimes you can go home again. Highly recommended.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This is pretty much just a bunch of leftovers from the Kid A sessions. And sure enough, on songs like &quot;Packt Like Sardines In a Crushd Tin Box&quot;, &quot;Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors&quot;, &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot; (an uninspired remix of the haunting Kid A song) and &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; this is evident. The studio version of &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; totally fails to do the live one justice. The rest is solid though. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; is probably the best Radiohead piano ballad ever, and features some of Phil Selway's most impressive drumming. &quot;You and Whose Army&quot; has one of the most haunting, powerful climaxes in any Radiohead song, and is absolutely chilling on headphones. &quot;Knives Out&quot; is the most straight forward song on the album, and is the only one that really sounds like it could have been on The Bends. The studio version of &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; is far more mellow and moody than the jazzy live version, and shows a very interesting side of the song. &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; has to be my favorite from the album. The song's music consists of the music for the song &quot;I Will&quot;, only played backwards. The vocals are done normally over the backwards melody. &quot;I Will&quot; would later appear on Hail To The Thief sounding nothing like &quot;Spinning Plates&quot; backwards, but as it is an old song, they could easily have reworked it. &quot;Spinning Plates&quot; is one of the most haunting, beautiful Radiohead songs and shows that the band is still experimenting with brilliant results. &quot;Life In a Glass House&quot; closes the album, and is the only Radiohead song ever to feature a trumpet. I was never a big fan of this song, although there's no question it's a well done piece. It's one of the eeriest songs on the album and also one of the more straightforward ones (despite the trumpet, which makes it far jazzier than the usual Radiohead song). <br />If you liked Kid A, you'll probably like this. The album's biggest weakness is the lack of cohesion. While Kid A flowed perfectly, you can tell that Amnesiac was just a bunch of songs thrown together. The other big weakness is that some of the b-sides for &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Knives Out&quot; such as &quot;Trans-Atlantic Drawl&quot;, &quot;Worrywort&quot;, &quot;Cuttooth&quot; and &quot;Fog&quot; were left off. Any of these great songs being included could have made the album much better. Despite being Radiohead's weakest since Pablo Honey, this is by no means a bad album, and features several classic Radiohead tunes.
B00005JN1L|4.0|In general, the movie was great.  The acting and casting was near perfect, however, anyone who has seen adaptation can't help but notice how many \\"rules\\" are broken (i.e. lots of voice over when it wasn't really needed).  It was worth seeing, though the plot was not the strongest, and the ending was somewhat predictable.  Johnny Depp was his normal wonderful self, and assumed the role completely.  He wasn't the only great actor, the cast as a whole was strong.  It had its funny moments, its suspense and its gruesome times.  They were balanced very well.  All in all, it was a good movie, but not the best.
B0000TB050|5.0|U2 are the greatest rock band to ever grace this world.  It is probably their best live concert.  Awesome
B000002J1H|5.0|Moraz was never integral to YES - he joined when Relayer was almost finished and added some touches. Yes couldn't stand him anymore while they were making this album. The gave him bus fare home and called Wakemen back. RICK, DONT EVER LEAVE AGAIN! It has taken me 25 years to fully appreciate this album. I saw YES in '77 (among other times) and I'll never forget Alan White playing the Tympani in &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; - I remember thinking that for the first time since being in that band for 5 years he finally made my list as &quot;Worlds Greatest Drummer&quot;-<br />&quot;Onward&quot; - took me years for this one-Jon Anderson is a very special person who walks, thinks and talks a little different than the rest of us. &quot;Parallels&quot; you gotta like right off - its an easy one to like-if you dont have this album-get it-and while your at it, get ALL the others too-you'll be glad you did.
B00003CX9E|1.0|Spoilers Herein.<br />This an extremely influential film, by one of the very few inventors of cinema. But I do not think it is Welles' best. (That's either `Othello' or `Lady from Shanghai' depending on your religion.)<br />First of all, this is not the work of a genius, but the excellent product of three committed artisans: Welles, Tobin and Mankiewicz.<br />Mankiewicz, with his brother, were the industry's working intellectuals. Here (aided by Houseman), he simply got a client intelligent enough to know what was up. Similarly with Tobin, who was the Sascha Vierny of his day. These two men pulled on Welles, but as we will see, in independent directions.<br />The story, Hearst and all that, is irrelevant except for the notion that a writer in the right place can create reality if willing to pay the price. The acting is fine of course, uncharacteristically abstract -- but that's hardly innovative nor groundshaking. No, what makes this film important are two features, and the failed relationship between them.<br />The first of these is the incredibly complex narrative structure. Things that are normally nested frames: a reminiscent flashback, a text annotated with pictures... are here multiply set up and in turn enfolded into the film proper. We see a newsreel, whose footage later appears in the `real' action; we have a recalled death vision of a childhood but that becomes untenably self-critical; we see her singing and again from her perspective. We have several on-screen narrators but each gets swallowed. There are so many narrative devices at work it keeps us spinning, sledding as each comes into play and is then reabsorbed. The puzzle is assembled several different ways. Nowhere else is such narrative cleverness been even attempted, not by Lynch, Bergman, Wenders, anyone.<br />The other innovation is the breaking of convention with the eye of the camera. The camera takes positions -- physical and philosophical -- that were previously utterly unknown. Previously, the camera was audience supplemented by `context' shots: perspectives that a human observer might not see but that seemed natural. Now, the camera is something unto itself that we have to accommodate. The camera does things no human would or could. It sometimes (often!) sees two things simultaneously, something that never happens with the natural eye. It has a curiosity that we would not have directed. The eye defines the lighting, not the other way around -- here everything is colored not by what it is, but by how the film's eye changes it.<br />Both of these experiments are masterful. They changed the world of films, and hence dreams, and hence all of abstract thinking forever.<br />But the flaw, the lethal problem with this film is that the two experiments have independent lives. They are not coordinated beyond some fairly easy touchpoints and then only in the simplest of ways: an image that is being described by a speaker and the nature of the newsreel. It is as if there were TWO geniuses at work, each doing something important and neither communicating with the other. So when there is a shift or a trick in the narrative, the eye is ignorant of it.<br />But hey, it was just the man's first film. He quickly fixed that in `Othello' and especially `Shanghai.' The merger of eye and narrative is the real revolution. `Kane' raised the question, which is why it is important. Tarkovsky, some Bergman, Malick, Greenaway have subsequently succeeded with this merger using different devices, but the master is Kurosawa. Welles made Kurosawa possible. It all starts here, but only as a promise. In real terms, the film is a failure.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I wasn't sure about this one at first. A friend was going to loan me his copy and then when I asked again, he said he didn't really like it so he traded it off.<br />After watching it about half-way through I found myself laughing out loud in my living room.......THESE GUYS ARE GREAT, REALY GREAT, REALLY, REALLY GREAT! How could anyone not like this? This is great family fun. Steve Howe seemed a little out of sorts (and if I were him I would lose the glasses) But Chris Squire and Jon Anderson are steller throughout. It's Alan White though, that'll knock you out. if you are even a &quot;mild&quot; Yes fan this is a MUST SEE and also you need to catch their BIG tour this spring.
B0000C8AQM|2.0|This movie was great I love it. But this soundtrack is CRAP!!! Whatever happen to the songs that really rocked? 'Highway to Hell'? 'Back in Black'? 'Smoke on the Water'? you know the songs that the kids play. I think there should be a second soundtrack honering the greatist rock songs. Now that would be an album I would buy.
B000002BYD|5.0|YIELD is one of the most truthful and inspiring albums I own. This album contains almost everything you could ask for - <BR>grunge grand-rockers like &quot;Brain of J.&quot; or &quot;Do the Evolution&quot;,<BR>breath-taking, passionate songs like &quot;Given to Fly&quot;,<BR>radio friendly songs like &quot;MFC&quot; and &quot;Faithful&quot;,<BR>interesting experiments (&quot;Push me, Pull me&quot;)<BR>and more steady, hushed and beautiful songs like &quot;Wishlist&quot;, &quot;Low Light&quot; and &quot;All those Yesterdays&quot;.<br />The band admits, that this record is much more collective than their previous 4 albums. That's exactly what I felt when I heard YIELD for the first time , because you can really sense every member of PJ give his heart and soul in every song.    <br />So, if you can appreciate good music, I highly recommend this record, as well as all others PEARL JAM albums.
0553583182|2.0|Basically the author read &quot;PsychoCybernetics&quot; written by Maxwell Maltz in 1960 and attempted to paraphrase the entire book (while leaving out critical details). It's a cheap watered down carbon copy that even occassionally plagarizes the original.  If you want to read the best book ever written about the subconscious mind and circumvent all of the silly new age garbage (I.E. This book claims that the Biblical term &quot;LORD&quot; is actually referring to our subconscious mind.?) then pickup a copy of PsychoCybernetics. It is much better.
8478886559|2.0|The third Harry Potter book is awesome. The author really lets the characters evolve and be more real than the previous two books. She lets them have more emotional depth and it's great.<br />The translation, however, is not that great. There are parts where I simply do no understand why the translators chose one word instead of some other, much better, alternative.<br />I agree with the first reviewer. The Spanish language can lend itself really well to certain things, and children's literature is definitely one of them. This translation could have been so different. There was such potential and it was just completely ignored.<br />Here's an example:<br />The title of the first chapter is \\"Lechuzas Mensajares,\\" which means \\"Messenger Owls.\\" The title of the first chapter in the English book is \\"Owl Post.\\" I simply don't understand why the translators didn't translate it as \\"Correo de Lechuza\\" or even a less grammatically correct \\"Lechuza Correo\\" or any other variant of the two words.<br />It really is a good book, it's just sad the translation doesn't do it justice. The publishers really should retranslate it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Just about a week ago, I was the host of a party. I wanted to purchase some entertaing kind of music. I was very doubtful of getting this CD because none of my friends like Britney. I don't mind her but I'm not a very big fan of her either. I was even more doubtful of buying it when I saw the reviews here. But I was like - what the heck...and I bought it. I was in for a wonderful surprise. So were all my friends. <BR>Every song in this CD has something about it that will create an impression in your head. It is simply great for a party. <BR>You must get it.
B000002AZ8|4.0|I always want to like this album more, but some of the songs are annoying, and really disrupt the flow. Minus these songs, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; would be near perfect, but I just can't get past &quot;Bugs&quot;, &quot;Aye Davanita&quot;, and the last track. But on the positive side, half of this ranks with the best &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; has ever done. &quot;Nothingman&quot;, &quot;Corduroy&quot;, &quot;Better Man&quot;, and &quot;Immortality&quot; are all excellent, and they alone make this essential for the &quot;PJ&quot; fan. Overall though, I think &quot;Vs.&quot;, &quot;Yield&quot;, and &quot;Riot Act&quot; are much stronger and more consistent, and therefore more &quot;Vital&quot;.
B00013F38K|2.0|.<BR>&quot;Kung Fu&quot; is the best TV series known to me because it really shows  what real Kung Fu is: philosophy of life, how to lead a life in wisdom and of course martial art when there is no other way ;-)<br />The story is absolutely great! A shaolin monk(David Carradine) walking through the wild west in the 19th century and encountering all the follies of wordly life and taking care of the situation the best he can. <br />The scenes are very carefully filmed: an artwork of the director and the cameraman.<br />The worse it is that you can not enjoy it if you buy this DVD because the editors of this DVD have cut off the heads of actors,  the deep blue sky in many scenes that give the beatiful atmosphere and so on only to get a widescreen format of films that formerly had been in TV format. They should have preserved all the information of the original format!<br />Now the artwork is destroyed :-(<br />The stories, the director, the cameraman, the artists get 5 STARS.<br />This DVD edition gets 0 STARS that is an average of 2.5 STARS wich I reduce to 2 because of my disappointment...<br />I really hope they bring out another version without any loss ... means with all the information of the original films and where this marvellous artwork is preserved for all times :-)
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|Behind All Things Must Pass, this album is definitely in the fight for number 2 on the all-time George list.  Depending on my mood, Cloud Nine and Brainwashed also contend for that spot.<br />As I am writing this review at work, I will not take the time to break it down song by song, but let this be said; Your Love is Forever is the most beautiful song George wrote after ATMP.  The entire album is wonderful, but the amazing thing is, even if it were terrible, it would still be worth it just for that one track.  Good thing for us, every single track is top quality.  <br />Faster = Fantastic
B00005ATQH|4.0|while most of you are correct about the DVD &quot;lolita&quot; one of you left out something very important.<BR>yes both men end up dead, one shot and one from heart failue.<BR>lolita too dies, she doesnt go on with life with the guy she met her own age, she dies during child birth less than a month after the professor dies in prison.<br />it is a decent movie with a good story line just don't get it thinking you will see a lot of explicit material because that is not what the movie is meant to be and you will be disappointed.
0446677450|5.0|I think the book was great.  It had a lot of great information that teaches all readers how to spend their money wisely and how to keep it.  I recommenf it ti all people of aal ages, especially high school studentd.
B00005JL3A|1.0|Where to start, where to start. I know... the game. Resi Evil the game was, and still is, one of the greats. It had everything you could've hoped for. Zombies, action, scaryness, and a conspiracy/mystery. The sequels continued the story, and once again great. They where like movies themselves. Now, lets look at the movie on its own before we compare it to the original game (resident Evil 1 - psone). The casting of Milla Jovovich, although she can't act, wasn't bad. It was the others who where terrible. Michelle Rodriguez... OH MY GOD, when she tried to act tough, i squirmed. The Story... oh yeah, there is no story. The zombies... people with a bit of grey make up and contacts (although the dogs where good). Action... Yawn. Scary level 1-10 (10 highest) -4. Sory to sound sarcastic, but it stunk. Now the comparison. With the game, you had a great story with real suprising twists. You had real terror, and great music to go with it. Even the characters where top (although the voice acting is the only bad point on this game). It was gritty, it never had mad sci fi gizmos... it was a true horror game with true horror survival game play and could've been easily converted in to a film. But no, Paul Anderson (One of the worst directors ever) some how gets the job to turn this great game in to a film. Instead of keeping to the story, he throws out all the work done by the guys at Capcom and uses the name to tell his own so-called story. he throws out the characters of resi evil and brings his own in. Who ever says this is a kick ass movie deserves to have there ass's kicked. I've heard this be called a prequel. If its a prequel, where's Albert Wesker. Bye this film at your own preil. Regarding the sequel, Apocalypse, i've seen stills of Milla and the new character, Jill Valentine (thats right) and four words come to mind, looks cheap and tacky. Don't let the trailer fool you. Kick ass film... yeah right... idiots. If the review sounds rough, sorry. Very angry man. Paul Anderson has destroyed any chance of a proper Game Adaptation with Resi Evil, With Chris Redfield the main guy, and Albert Wesker the arch nemeisis and the betrayer. I Hope the studios see sense and don't make a 3rd resi film, and leave it a few years for a proper director to come in and revive the franchise in the proper way.
0553801546|3.0|I liked &quot;Farseer&quot; trilogy, I absolutely LOVED &quot;Liveship Traders&quot;, but &quot;Tawny Man&quot; left a taste of something written just to finish the series... Fitz is the main hero only because he's Catalyst to the White Prophet, which through middle tree books is a woman...?!<BR>The plot is inconsistent, with weak links, unfinished story lines in middle and too much finished story lines at the end (all those in stile &quot;happily ever after&quot;). I didn't want Fitz dead but there could be different hero... Or may be there's another trilogy waiting?<BR>I do not wish to finish with a bad taste - writing itself is as always brilliant, but as I said, other factors don't let this book rise to flight like Icefire dragon!
B00005JKC3|2.0|This was a film i was looking forward to. After X-men and especially Spiderman, i was expecting a hugh blockbuster. Instead, what i got was a hugh melo-drama that was attempting to look to artsy fartsy. What was bad was that it didn't just stick to the comic book, there where changes, and not for the better. With X-men and Spiderman, the changes you see (the costumes in x-men - the organic webbing in spidey) where a necessity and chasnges for the better, but no changes to the origins story. In Hulk, i don't remember anything about Bruce's father injecting him with something as a child to help bring the Hulk to life. Why they did this when it was never part of the origin story is beyond me. If they where trying to improve on it, they failed, because you can't improve up on it. The casting of the movie was a brilliant choice.Jenniffer Connoly was top notch as Betty, full of character and emothion, she brought her to life, Nic Nolte was average as the dad. While Eric Bana was a good choice for Bruce, the dialogue and direction used for him impaired him from doing his job properly. The only good thing about this film was the CGI and the use of comic stips throughout the film. Don't bother with it, a waste of money.
B0001ENY6M|1.0|I thought while I was watching the passion of the christ that I could almost pick out the same drone variations and electric violins as in Peter Gabriel&quot;s &quot;passion&quot; the album, the most overlooked soundtrack in the history of all films.  Do yourself a favor and buy this you won't be able to tell the difference plus you'll have an album that lasts the test of time.  After all peter wrote it more than ten years ago, and Debney can't help but say in his work that nothing says Christ movie like peter gabriel's passion.
B000089RVX|1.0|...Evanescence!<br />This &quot;band&quot; (using the term loosely - it's clearly The Amy Lee Show) is obviously the beneficiary of this whole &quot;alternative to teen pop&quot; wave that's going on, along with the likes of Avril Lavigne.  &quot;Wow, they play their own instruments and write their own songs - how amazing!&quot;<br />People, don't let the whole wave of bubblegum pop distort your view of this incredibly average band.  Evanescence can be described as a hybrid of Lacuna Coil (only far more commercial and not nearly as artistic), Linkin Park and Sarah McLachlan - they're desperately shooting for across-the-board mass appeal as well as incredibly image-conscious.  They seem to be going for a pseudo-goth look, yet they have these wholesome saccharine lyrics that are in stark contrast to their appearance.<br />Let's move on to the actual songs: The guitar parts are as simplistic as your token rap-metal band, the rhythms aren't all that complex, and when Amy Lee sings during the choruses, she sounds like she's auditioning for a Broadway show.  &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; became popular because it sounds just like a Linkin Park song, complete with obligatory nonsense rapping courtesy of Paul McCoy from goody-goody Christian rockers 12 Stones.  You also have your overwrought, cloying ballads like &quot;My Immortal&quot;, a melodramatic weeper that easily could have been written by the likes of Diane Warren.  The other songs on the album sound pretty much like &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, only thankfully they spared us the hokey rapping.<br />In summary: Don't believe the hype, this is not the astounding work of art that MTV and radio want you to think it is.  But if you're looking for a by-the-numbers collection of pseudo-gothic rap-rock and maudlin power ballads, here you go.
B00005JM20|2.0|There's a reason this movie bombed at the box office.  It stinks.  Mr. Bean has a go at playing Bond in this mildly amusing spy spoof.  After having (...)erotic dreams about being Agent One, Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) indirectly kills Agent One by providing faulty entry codes for one of his missions.  Later, at Agent One's funeral, the rest of the agents are blown into oblivion when Bean allows a bomb to slip into the funeral in Agent One's coffin.<br /><br />From there the film deteriorates into Bean's bumbling attempts to recover the stolen Royal Crown Jewels.  Few laughs and if you're watching too late at night you'll be fighting the impulse to fall asleep.  Not too offensive for the kiddies, though.<br /><br />Save your money.
B00007ELEL|5.0|This was the first film that the Coen Brothers released after their wildly popular 1996 hit &quot;Fargo&quot;, which was a huge success from both a critical and commercial viewpoint.  Unfortunately, it didn't garner the reviews and press that it deserved, and was a box office disappointment.  Deservingly, it seems to have found a second life as a cult film, and has even spawned an annual gathering of fans of the file called Lebowski Fest.<br />The plot is deceptively simple, as suggested by the description on the box - a hippie that's down on his luck gets mistaken for a billionaire with the same name as his by a couple of thugs, who &quot;soil&quot; his rug after he doesn't automatically comply with their demands.  He goes to the home of the billionaire Jeffrey Lebowski hoping to be compensated for his soiled rug, and what follows is absolute insanity - the film is punctuated by several eccentric characters and the clever dialogue that has become associated with all Coen films.  Some have said that this movie is pointless, but I think of it as being ambiguous and open to interpretation.  This movie has the rare achievement of being at once simple and complex.  The Dude is so leisurely and laid back, Walter is the confrontational member of the group, and Donny is the mild-mannered introvert - part of this movie's appeal is that it's easy to relate to the character ... either you know someone that displays similar behavior to one of these characters, or maybe even you have the similarities.  John Turturro (Jesus) steals pretty much every scene he's in - I just wish they would have built up more of an on-screen rivalry than they did. <br />All told, this is one of the most innovative and original films that has come out in the past few decades, comedic or otherwise.  I can't recommend it enough.
0698119347|5.0|Storm Breaker: An Alex Rider Adventure<br />Storm Breaker: An Alex Rider Adventure, by Anthony Horowitz, is a book of secret agents in England. The book was one of the coolest books that I read and I loved it. The book has a lot of adventure, action, and a lot of detail that lets the reader feel like he is there watching it, or living it. `Alex let go of the steering wheel, grabbed the harpoon gun, and fired. The harpoon flashed through the air...Alex felt himself almost being torn in half as he was yanked out of the jeep on the end of the cord. In seconds he was forty, fifty yards above the runway, dangling underneath the plane.' By the end of the first chapter, the book draws the reader in and they will not want to put it down. <BR>The book's main character, fourteen-year-old Alex Rider, discovers that his dead uncle is an MI6 agent (Britain's top-secret intelligence agency), and is hired to complete his uncle's last mission. This book is one of the coolest books that I've read. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes books with action or adventure in it.

B000069HKH|4.0|This is the only CD I own by this artist. The first three songs, Lonesome Day, Into The Fire and Waitin' On A Sunny Day, are worth the price alone. Into The Fire is especially a poignant anthem about people who put their lives on the line every day, not just the one day, 9/11. That is a day that many people seem to have forgotten, or they would rather blame our own foreign policy, our democracy, our capitalism, etc., than on the fact there are people who would like to kill us for no other reason than that we are radically different. This CD is important because it serves as a time capsule for a day which should never be forgotten by us or by America's allies. It doesn't scream &quot;America is Great, so take this or take that, Saddam, Osama, whatever,&quot; although I am not about to say those people shouldn't have a voice, partly because I believe those things, too. I believe<br />America's so-called corporate greed or imperialism in no way justified these attacks, partly also because of the very people Springteen sings about, the type of people who would run into a burning or crumbling building risking, and sometimes sacrificing, their lives, people who face danger every day and don't get recognized for it. This album is also important because, well, the music is good, too.

031286504X|5.0|SO BUY THIS BOOK!<br /><br />This is where it all started. The pioneering work that later inspired George Romero's \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\" and Stephen King's \\"Salem's Lot\\" and every other tale of a normal human being fighting against the odds in a world gone mad with the hungry hordes of the undead.<br />Matheson, a TV writer (most notable work, \\"The Twilight Zone\\"), places us in a world where a mysterious virus has not only killed off virtually ever other man, woman and child but causes them to return as zombielike vampires intent on only one thing... to drain the blood of the living. Matheson's hero holds up in his old family home, now a battered fortress assaulted nightly by what were once his friends and neighbors and who have become the walking dead intent on taking hold and devouring him. He, in turn, waits until the morning light and searches out there hiding places in order to destroy the revenants when they are at their most vulnerable. A one man army, who is patiently, skillfully ridding his world of this vermin.<br />Fortunately, in one of his sweeps he finds that there is another who is doing the same thing. He is not alone in the world afterall.<br />Unfortunately, this other wants to destroy him as well.<br /><br />Matheson wrote a thinking man's horror novel. He touches on that feeling of alienation and loneliness that pervades so much of our modern world. A world that places us as pawns, used (and often victimised) by the science and technologies of our own creation. However, Matheson also inspires in the reader a feeling of hope and fighting back even if the odds are staggeringly against us. He appeals to the survivalist instincts that every healthy, normal man and woman possess. He builds the anger in us to strike back and overcome the menace to our existence.<br />Two movies made were based on \\"I Am Legend\\": \\"The Last Man On Earth\\", starring Vincent Price and the classic, \\"Omega Man\\", starring Charleton Heston. Neither of these came close to the quality of this novel. This book is essential reading and keeping for every horror fan, especially us zombie fanatics. Now go order this book!book is essential reading and keeping for every horror fan, especially us zombie fanatics. Now go order this book!
1401300901|1.0|This book was on the up and coming table at Barnes &amp; Noble; the jacket certainly sounded great. Indeed, it was the plot that led me to assign this one star instead of zero (but you can read the plot in the summary and be done with it). Two chapters into the book I checked the &quot;about the author&quot; to discover who wrote this awful book that read like a high schooler's creative writing assignment... it was no surprise to see that she was the 21-year daughter of Ireland's prime minister. Only with connections could such a book have been published. Poorly written, superficial characters, way too many adjectives... this book belongs in the teen section.
B00003CX9W|4.0|\\"Fantasia\\" is the classic 1940 film that features the iconic \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" short.  \\"Fantasia\\" is a different sort of film from anything else that Disney Studios has ever produced.  It is a very experimental film, and one that must have been very daring to release at the time (as it would still be so today).  Rather than hold to a normal sort of storytelling, \\"Fantasia\\" is more like going to see an orchestral concert.  \\"Fantasia\\" is a marriage between music and image, and this time around it is the images that are on screen that only support the music.  The music is the focus of this film.<br />On one hand, this is a fascinating film.  The music is conducted by Leopold Stowoski and we are taken on a journey of music with the images serving only to complement what we are hearing.  Narrated by Deems Taylor, we are told what is going to happen in each segment and what music we are going to hear.  We begin with the animation just being shapes and colors reacting to the music, giving us the impression of what we might see if we closed our eyes while listening to the music.  When we move into the next song, we are given more definite images and then the music starts to tell an actual story.<br />There are several excellent selections in this film.  \\"The Nutcracker Suite\\", \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", and \\"The Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria\\" are standout selections in my mind and are the ones that have stuck with me several days later.  Despite this being an animated film, this isn't a movie for young children.  They are likely to be scared by \\"The Night on Bald Mountain\\" and perhaps even by \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", and they may not understand or appreciate this film as it does not truly tell a story (like \\"The Lion King\\" does).  The bottom line is this is a good film, and an interesting movie experiment, but on the same token it is not a movie for everyone.  It is a symphony with animation.

0321127420|4.0|Martin Fowler is a brand name for lucid (&quot;UML distilled&quot;), maturity enhancing (&quot;Refactoring&quot; for the practical side and the great &quot;Analysis Patterns&quot; for the modeling side) top notch books for software professionals. This book even has on its front cover a label telling us it is a &quot;Martin Fowler Signature Book&quot;. This book was a disappointment. In the introduction Fowler claims much less. This book should be merely &quot;useful&quot;. It is much better than that. It is good.<br />So what is the problem? The title is misleading. It is about patterns, but not really about enterprise applications. I am not in the subject of enterprise applications. I never ever have touched a program like SAP or a language like COBOL. But I encountered nearly every problem addressed in the patterns. Even the money class has corresponding problems in other fields: a Voltage has both a value and a unit. Also having complaints about the fact that 3 times 33% are less than 100% are always common.<br />What is this book about? It is basically about problems you have in moderately big applications. How do you connect a relational database with its structure and transactionality to a system, especially an object-oriented system (but not only)? And how do you connect to the user interface, especially a web interface. Also it contains a lot of useful small patterns at the end. As you can see: a lot of valuable stuff for many people. Yes and you get the deep judgments and fine humor of Martin Fowler too.<br />What is the main problem? This book is not really suited for actual reading. It contains an introductory part of a hundred and a reference part of four hundred pages. The introduction part is annoying to read. It is at the same time too simple (Some knowledge of relational databases should be a requirement for this book, and much more...) and too difficult (An extremely lot of forward references to patterns described later in this book). Also a lot ofstuff is in the most trivial sense repeated within a few pages distance only. And it is repeated down to the wording of the individual sentences.<br />The reference part is a lot better. It gets better to read the further along you already read. The number of forward references gets less along the way. I liked especially the last part about base patterns. As their name already says they should have been much more to the beginning of the book.<br />This book contains an excellent book within it, just waiting to be \\"refactored\\" out of this collection of valuable thoughts. I firmly believe that Martin Fowler is well suited to do this refactoring job. I do sincerely hope that he does it for the next edition of the book. Most of the work is already invested and the result would be very valuable for many people. It is possible to write excellent and readable books about patterns as for example Buschmann et al in \\"Pattern Oriented Software Architecture\\" showed.
0790743507|4.0|Singing in the Rain. One of the best musicals Hollywood has ever given us, starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debby Reynolds, and Jean Hegan in what might be the best performances of their lives.<br />It's about Hollywood it the time when sound pictures were just coming into focus. Enter Don Lockwood, an silent screen star who doesn't take show biz too seriously, and Lena Lemont, who is a beautiful actress but has a high-pitched, screechy voice and has the mistaken idea that Don is heads over heels in love with her, which he is most emphatically not.<br />Add to that Cosmo Brown, Don's sidekick who is smart as a whip but prefers to be a comedian and Kathy Seldon, a pretty dancer who is tugging at Don's heartstrings.<br />Then add to all that the fact that sound pictures are all the rage but Lena ruins every one that she's in because of her voice, and throw in some wonderful songs, and you have the makings for a fantastic movie that is well loved made<br />The songs in this movie are some of the best I've ever heard, including \\"Make `em laugh\\" with Donald O'Connor, \\"You were meant for Me\\" with Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, and of course, \\"Singing in the Rain\\" with Gene Kelly.<br />When watching the movie, it's almost impossible to realize that it was make just to string together a bunch of songs, and the script was built around them, and that Gene Kelly did the number \\"Singing in the Rain\\" with a tempeture of 107.Imagine what it would have looked like with him feeling 100%!<br />Of course, every movie has its faults, and this one is no exception, but the good parts make up for the bad ones. But that's just my opinion. You really need to see this movie for yourself, and then you'll know what I'm talking about. But I promise you will not be disappointed.
B0000009SM|5.0|One size fits all indeed. It's one of few Zappa albums that can be described simply as \\"perfect\\" - there's something magical about it. FZ is known for many things, one is the great quality of his musicians, and many claim that this band was his finest. OSFA proves that that might be the case. The musical performances are beyond words, and the deep sound of the whole recording brings a powerful and convincing mood which makes you appreciate the feeling of the cover art; it sounds as it looks. Unlike a lot of Zappa's albums--especially around this period--this one has very few changes in the rhythm section; on bass, Tom Fowler is exchanged for James Youman on one song, but Chester Thompson plays drums, Ruth Underwood plays percussion, and George Duke plays keyboards throughout. That is definitely a reason why this album, despite alternation of styles and lead singers, has a steady main thread. Furthermore this album doesn't alternate styles as dramatically as many others - the music can fairly be described as \\"rock/fusion,\\" even though there's more to it than that; blues elements and light melodic influences here and there by e.g. Stravinsky would be two things. The musicians are experienced and skilled in jazz et al., and their ensemble playing therefore brings a very unique feel to this music. Also, credited as \\"Bloodshot Rollin' Red\\" (for contractual reasons) is Captain Beefheart, playing the harmonica on \\"San Ber'dino.\\"<br />The compositions are all great and powerful, and taken to even further heights by the truly dedicated musicians. Those who enjoyed FZ's three albums prior to OSFA --\\"Over-Nite Sensation,\\" \\"Apostrophe (')\\" and \\"Roxy and Elsewhere\\"-- will absolutely not be disappointed - on the contrary.
B0001611DI|5.0|Geroge A. Romero's second feature in the 'Holy Trilogy' is without a doubt the best. 'Night' had the ability to freak you out, simply plotwise. 'Day' had the ability to make your mind spin with both the plot and the visual effects. 'Dawn' makes you freak out on the basic principal of the story -- not to mention the gore (some of the zombies look fake; but what can you do?). The DiviMax DVD release is a shameful way to get publicity. They released this simply because the first two editions (theatrical &amp; director's cut) are out of print and the fact that the remake was being released -- so they rushed this edition. Audio commentaries are excellent, as well as the theatrical trailers and television spots. The picture is a miracle! Absolutely outstanding job on the video clean-up. The audio was pretty impressive as well. However, it lacks the special features that we'll be getting in the &quot;multi-disc&quot; release. Word of the &quot;multi-disc&quot; is that it will have both the theatrical cut and the director's cut. I also heard it WILL be loaded down with other special features -- this being said, how many discs will there be? I figure three -- one disc apiece for the films and another disc for the special features. Now with 'Dawn' getting a 2-3 disc treatment, 'Day' getting a cozy 2 disc set, how about 'Night' getting a nice little 2 disc release?

B00012QM8G|5.0|This film transcends any packaging issues.  The DVD itself demonstrates excellent transfer quality.  Most importantly, in reviewing this work, one must recognize the singular achievement of the fine line that Steven Spielberg, the remarkable cast and crew, editors, and John Williams, all managed to walk across as they presented this remarkable true story of the most unlikely of heroes.  Telling the story from the perspective of an unlikely hero such as Oskar Schindler, allows everyone involved with this film to find a touching and hope-filled story in the midst of such respectfully well-filmed horror and despair.  By staying within the realm of hope, Spielberg, et al, was able to illustrate the horror of the Holocaust while reaching the broadest audience possible with a message of triumph against the deepest adversity.  By having the German Oskar Schindler, blemishes and all, emerge as the hero of this film, prevents the movie from isolating ANY group and articulately shows that all of us, no matter what our flaws or origins are, possess the ability to prevail against extreme forms of evil.  It is truly unfortunate that stories like those of Oskar Schindler were the exception, rather than the rule.  My deepest respect and gratitude to Steven Spielberg and all participants in this true epic that will stand as a monument to victims over their victimizers for the rest of time. Its approachablility will keep this film widely watched forever.
B00005JMTN|4.0|I'm a big fan of Tim Burton, so I walked into Big Fish with some trepidation. I was aware that this was Tim's big break - a genre movie that wasn't quite so \\"genre,\\" just like Sam Raimi directing Spider-man. Would he be able to pull off something that's not quite so dark and wonderful but still retain that magical quality that makes Tim's movies so much fun?<br />Yes!<br />This is not to say that Big Fish is a happy-go-lucky film. The plot revolves around Will Bloom, a journalist, and his tenuous relationship with his tall-tale-telling father, Edward Bloom. You see, Edward doesn't just make up stories -- he transforms them into Homeric proportions as he spins each tale for his audiences. What Will found to be a wonderful trait as a boy turned to cynicism and frustration as a man. It's like finding out Santa Claus isn't really but still seeing him every day. What do you say to the man?<br />Nothing, in Will's case. He had long since stopped talking to his father. But then Edward falls ill and Will is called back home. Thus begins a journey through Edward's life, as told by Edward himself and played out for audience as if it were real.<br />What's compelling about Big Fish is that the events are played with enough seriousness to take them as truth. Yes, there's a witch with a glass eye, a goat-eating giant, the conjoined singing twins Ping and Jin, and a ghostly town named Spectre. But they are all presented with careful maturity. When one of Ed's young friends looks into the witch's eye, he sees his own death on a toilet bowl as a middle-aged man. You half expect his head to explode or something.<br />That theme, that Ed knows when he's going to die, is an undercurrent throughout the entire film because it crosses the line between fantasy and reality. If Ed's tales are actually false, if they're complete fabrications, why does a man on his deathbed believe in them so strongly? Is it just desperation? Or are they real, in some way?<br />The answer is both. Ultimately, Will keeps looking for answers that cannot be found - he wants to know his \\"real father,\\" but in reality he can't accept who his real father is. It is Will who is the fabrication - he has constructed a form of \\"normalcy\\" that doesn't exist and that he judges his father by. In the end, it's not about the veracity of anyone's story...it's about listening. All Will ever wanted to do is have his father listen to him.<br />And at the end of the film and Edward's life, he finally does. This is an exceptional piece and one Tim should be proud of that still manages to stay true to his fantasy roots and yet takes a serious look at very real issues of death, immortality, and a father and son's affection.ately, Will keeps looking for answers that cannot be found - he wants to know his \\"real father,\\" but in reality he can't accept who his real father is.

B00005JLEU|5.0|First, Spirited Away is about a little girl, but it is NOT A MOVIE FOR LITTLE KIDS.<br />This is something I feel should be stated up front for all the folks (*cough*mundanes*cough*) who think that anything that's animated is for kiddies. It ain't. Welcome to the world of anime.<br />Actually, let me amend that. There seems to be some anime apologists who are afraid the film will get a bad rap if parents are told that it's not for children. Well foo on them too. This is not a movie suitable for young children. I'll explain more in a moment.<br />And what a world it is. A young girl named Chihiro travels with her parents to their new home and on the way, take a short cut to what looks like an abandoned theme park. Her parents wander heedlessly into the grounds and find some delicious-smelling food, which they consume.<br />Then they turn into pigs. It's not a blink-and-you-miss-it special effect. It's a slow, terrifying effect. Chihiro's parents turn into big, fat, squealing pigs. It's horrible -- it's meant to be. Remember the not for kids warning? This is one reason why.<br />Chihiro is not without her allies. She meets Haku, a river dragon who appears to her in boy form (most of the time). With his help and guidance, Chihiro manages to survive her transition into what turns out to be the spirit world. She makes friends with a moustached, goggled spider-like being who runs the boilerroom and finds employment with Yubaba, the domineering old crone who runs the bathhouse.<br />Being that I've written a few fantasy books set in Russian fairytales (see Tsar Rising and The Dancing Hut), words like &quot;bathhouse,&quot; &quot;crone,&quot; and &quot;Yubaba&quot; ring bells. I'm saddened that very few reviewers picked up on the movie's inspiration.<br />The movie takes many of its cues from Russian myth. Yubaba = Baba Yaga, the infamous hag. Just as Yubaba has a baby she fawns over, Baba Yaga alternately menaces and cares for children. She has a host of young girls working for her in some stories -- in others, she is a cannibal. The parallels are all there.<br />There's more: Yubaba has a twin sister, Zeniba. In Russian myth, there's typically three hags (all sisters), but the similarity is unmistakable. And of course there's the bathhouse itself. In both Russian and Japanese myth, the bathhouse is a magical place where the spirits take over at midnight. Which is precisely what happens in Spirited Away.<br />And oh yeah, there's a two-headed eagle (a symbol of old Russia) on Yubaba's tapestry. Of course, nobody pays attention to Russia these days for reasons I can only ascribe to the Cold War.<br />There are plenty of elements that aren't from Russian myth. No-Face, a strange demon that leeches off of other people's personalities, changes from a benevolent ally to a monstrous thing that tries to eat everyone in the bathhouse. It moans and wails, it eats people, it's really quite gross and scary -- not for kids.<br />What the movie does have is charm. Love, friendship, trust -- all these things help Chichiro to survive. Her good-hearted actions save her (just like in Russian myth...most of the time) and help her defeat Yubaba at her own game.<br />The animation is superb. The voice acting (including the dub) is excellent. Disney is giving Japanese anime the respect it deserves. See it.<br />This movie IS worth seeing with your tween daughter. As in, 10 years old and up.working for her in some stories -- in others, she is a cannibal. The parallels are all there. <br />There's more: Yubaba has a twin sister, Zeniba.

A lot of people will say that Kanye can't rhyme or can't spit or whatever, but his lyrics are real, and his flow is different but original and good. I mean if you really listen to his songs your gain something, because its raw. Its real.

B00008EY9G|5.0|Ever see Memento?<br />Identity's like that. It takes place in another person's mind. It's disjointed. It tells the events out of order. The order of the movie's scenes gives insight into what's really happening. And of course, people die and nobody's sure who did it or how.<br />Identity is not quite as slick as Memento. It's choppy at parts, disjointed or just plain plays dirty pool in others.<br />10 strangers end up stranded in the rain at a creepy hotel. The laws of their world slowly unravel as they attempt to escape -- cell phones don't work, cars can't cross the flooded roads, and accidents happen that keep them from escaping the area and each other.<br />There's a lot of interesting characters. There's the cop and the serial killer con he's escorting to an execution. There's the limo driver who was once a cop. There's the hooker with a heart of gold. The couple who just got married because the girl's pregnant. The average family, complete with silent little boy and weird stepdad. The bitchy washed-up actress. And of course, the freaky hotel owner.<br />Everyone in the movie has a secret. The secrets unravel as things go from bad to worse and each person gets bumped off. Some of the deaths are accidents, some are outright murders. All of them leave the corpse with a hotel key, in the order of each person killed. Things get REALLY weird when the hotel keys starting showing up on corpses that died by accident.<br />If you haven't figured it out yet, the rest of this review contains a spoiler. It's the only way I can talk about the film with any candor. So kiddies who don't want the ending spoiled for them, leave the room.<br />Identity takes place in Malcolm Rivers' head. He has 10 personalities in there banging around and Malcolm is about to be executed for murder. Malcolm murdered a bunch of people at a hotel (six victims, I believe), stabbing them to death. But his psychiatrist submits that Malcolm is legally insane and that a new drug treatment will force the personalities to eliminate each other.<br />The premise of Identity is great. I also figured it out five minutes into the film. If you pay attention, the pictures in the first few minutes of the film -- along with certain phrases said by the patient -- are repeated by characters within the movie. In that respect, Identity is internally consistent. If you know that (and when I was watching this with my brother, he didn't catch it), the rest of the movie falls into place pretty quickly.<br />I couldn't help but feel the cut scenes involving the psychiatrist broke up the flow. I wanted a real mystery that strung me along and it felt like Identity thought I was too stupid to keep up.<br />And yet, Identity is definitely an expertly crafted work. There's even a surprise twist -- the dominant personality isn't who you think it is (SURPRISE!) but what's irritating is that while every other twist and turn can be figured out, the final twist simply can't be predicted.<br />In essence, the movie is internally consistent until it isn't, and I felt a bit betrayed by the way it ended.<br />On the other hand, the ending is delicious. It's grimly cynical but perfectly poised, a tribute to everything Hitchcockian and &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; (which the film directly references). Identity loses points for not being perfectly consistent, but it's still a damn fine movie.<br />Oh yeah. John Cusack kicks ass in anything with him in it. That boosts a movie normally that would get a 4 from me to a 5.force the personalities to eliminate each other. <br />The premise of Identity is great.

078322947X|4.0|Sorcerer showed up in the mail via NetFlix and for the life of me I couldn't remember why I ordered it. One theory is that I thought it was a fantasy flick. The title has little to do with the movie itself and it's certainly not about fantasy sorcerers casting spells. Another possibility, and more likely, is that I was writing a review of Vertical Limit and someone mentioned that Sorcerer did it first.<br />It doesn't matter, I watched the movie anyway. And what I saw was alternately painful and enthralling.<br />Sorcerer is about four men down on their luck. Actually, that's an understatement. They're not just down on their luck; they're at the very rock bottom of their lives. They are each one step away from complete oblivion, be it at an assassin's hand or their own.<br />The movie starts out with little apology tracking these four independent threads. The first half hour of the film makes no sense because we don't know what we're seeing: one Frenchman businessman is ruined and flees the country; a New York wheelman crosses the wrong gang; a Middle Eastern terrorist bombs a dwelling; one is an assassin. They are all on the run from their respective countries.<br />They all end up in Vera Cruz, in South America, a stinking fissure in the earth. Naked children and dogs wander the streets. Everything is encrusted in dirt and the slime of sweat, rain, mud, and oil. The only place a man can find work is at the oil company upon which Vera Cruz depends for its survival.<br />An explosion sabotages the well. The oil burns and will burn forever unless it is covered - and that requires explosives. Of course, in the South American jungles the nearest cache of nitroglycerine has been festering for years and become highly unstable. It can't be lifted by helicopter, so trucks must carry it. One strong bump and the nitroglycerine explodes.<br />Finally, the movie gets interesting. We have four unlikable characters forced to work together. They must battle the elements, bandits, and human stupidity to ensure their cargo and their lives make it to the oil well intact.<br />If you recall Vertical Limit, the concepts were the same: different groups armed with nitroglycerine must brave nature and the elements for some noble cause. While not as gut wrenching as Vertical Limit, Sorcerer manages to inject pathos into the characters. They weep, they take desperate measures, and they become more noble as they rise to each crushing challenge.<br />Ultimately, all of them came to Vera Cruz to flee something else. Now that they have come to Hell, like Orpheus and Dante they must descend to its bowels to escape it. The journey with the nitroglycerine is their purgatory.<br />It's no surprise that few of the characters survive, but the movie goes one step further. The sole survivor finds solace in the dirt and horror of the town itself. In short, his journey to get enough money to escape was about selfish ends until he realizes that his struggles had purpose - he saved the town's fate, at least for a little while. His own life is precious. And so, he uses his last moments before leaving to dance with a haggard woman rather than make his escape. His redemption will not be satisfied with anything but his death.<br />And the name of the movie?

Children love the absolute meanness of the adults in the book, and Matilda?s unique solution to her wretched life.

B00005KHJR|3.0|This is a weird movie.<br />It's a good kind of weird, an anachronistic kind of weird, a religious hysteria kind of weird. But make no bones about it, this is not your average movie. Mundanes, move along.<br />Are they gone yet? Okay good. You're in for one hell of a freaky ride.<br />The Wicker Man is about an island, run by village folk who harken back to the old ways. And we're talking old ways: sucking on frogs to cure sore throats, dancing around maypoles, dressing up as fools, sacrificing maidens to keep the crops bountiful...oops, I've given away too much.<br />Enter an incredibly uptight, prudish, extremely Catholic, British police officer. Mix well. Add in some really bad 70s music, Christopher Lee, and a lot of bad photography and you get this movie. Which is not quite a horror movie, although it was released in the tradition of the Hammer horrors. Heck, to date, nobody really knows what to do with this flim. If you're a Christian or worship a non-traditional religion, this movie will likely rattle your cage. And it rattles cages in a good way, raising some thought provoking questions about who is in the right -- the religion that works for the majority, or the established hierarchy of the rest of the world. And really, who's the &quot;established&quot; religion anyway? Which came first -- the pagan chicken or the Christian egg?<br />What a lot of reviews don't mention is the rampant Anglocentricism throughout the film. We have a typical British officer casting aspersions on a Scottish community. For the American equivalent, it might be like a fundamentalist Christian minister visiting an all-black community. There's a lot of history there.<br />If said blacks suddenly started reenacting African rituals, most people (the reasonable ones anyway) might suspect it of bias. After all, African-Americans, just because of their heritage, didn't hop around shaking spears and dancing around flames. So why, then, are the poor Scottish folk shown as believing in all kinds of pagan beliefs, some of them randomly selected from other cultures?<br />To Americans, this may not seem like a big deal. To Europeans, or at least to the British, it might seem quaint. To anyone who is Scottish or pagan, it's blatant prejudice. I should know, Maleficent's a pagan, I'm a Roman Catholic, and we know all about the differences between the two religions. This movie does not.<br />At heart, the Wicker Man was an observation by Julius Caesar about the Gauls. See my Druid History article for more information. Julius was a conquerer, talking about people he defeated -- he was by no means an accurate representation of druidism. And modern Scottish people aren't any more affiliated with druidism than African Americans are affiliated with nature spirits.<br />The movie was a horror flick preying on the fears of the Europeans -- that Christianity DIDN'T WORK. You don't find that nearly as much these days in America. In the 70s, in Europe, this was a big deal.<br />However, given its background, we took the movie for what it is: a social commentary, a psychological horror, about the clash between modern and ancient times. As Carl Sagan pointed out in the Demon Haunted World...you can teach people that demons aren't real, but they'll just call them aliens instead.<br />This movie is worth seeing, if only to experience the crazy ending. But make no mistake: the snide British commentary about how great The Wicker Man constitutes a good part of what makes this film a &quot;horror.&quot;n all kinds of pagan beliefs, some of them randomly selected from other cultures? <br />To Americans, this may not seem like a big deal.

B0000DJZA0|2.0|I was looking forward to Coldplay live, popped in the DVD, and took it out after 10 minutes because the sound quality was so poor.  This wouldn't be such a problem if all of the same songs were on the CD, but not all the DVD songs are on the CD.  I thought it was two audio discs when I picked it up... talk about misleading advertising.  Why do I want to be near my TV to listen to it?  Although I love Coldplay, I'm very disappointed in this release and would have avoided it had I known how shoddy the quality is, and that I was really buying a DVD with bonus CD.
0393317552|5.0|I originally learned about Guns, Germs, and Steel on the RPG.net forums. It sounded like an excellent book to ground a Game Master or an author on world-building. So I put it on my wish list and last Christmas I received it as a gift. It took me this long to finish reading it, and I'm the better for it.<br />But I put it down after reading one chapter into it. The author, Jared Diamond, explains on page 19 that racist explanations are &quot;loathsome, but also...wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking.&quot; Then he turns around and states, &quot;...modern &quot;Stone Age&quot; peoples are on the average probably more intelligent, not less intelligent, than industrialized peoples. Displaying his bias up front, Diamond states on page 21, &quot;in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners, and they surely are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up.&quot;<br />There's a few problems with Diamond's arguments, not the least of which is that he spends two pages arguing a point that he has no means of scientifically proving. This is ironic, given his last chapter that talks about a scientific approach to history. It's also telling that Diamond has but one source mentioned in his notes for his argument that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners.<br />On its surface, I don't object to Diamond's bias. It does however, taint his entire argument. It's difficult to take Diamond seriously when he devotes an entire book proving that one society's domination of another is not inherently racist but determined by a wide variety of other factors - but oh yeah, New Guineans are genetically superior. It's like listening to a priest and a die-hard atheist argue - the two are so diametrically polarized, it's difficult to consider either argument as objective.<br />So I put the book down and it sat on my shelf for two months. Then I decided to give Diamond another chance, because some of what he said was intriguing. To whit, Diamond provides evidence that societies excel because of a combination of geographic and societal factors.<br />For example, farming societies can produce more food per square foot than hunting societies. Hunters have to expend energy to carry their children, so too many hinders the tribe. Farmers can stay put and reproduce as well as feed more mouths. As time goes on, farming societies can support politicians. Politicians are better at waging war and organizing peoples than hunters, who will often leave the area and move on to a less dangerous location.<br />Farmers also coexist with domesticated animals. Of particular relevant for world builders are the attributes that make an animal useful for domestication, including diet (food must be easily available), growth rate (they must grow quickly enough to be productive), breed in captivity, benign disposition, not prone to panic, and social structure (herd or pack mentalities allow humans to take roles in the domesticated animals' structure). Animals are important for another reason - by coexisting with them, humans are exposed to a wider variety of diseases earlier than hunters. This is how Europeans ended up plaguing North and South Americans.<br />Geographically, he east-west axis of a continent allows cultures to travel easier across similar terrain as opposed to a north-south continent, which will have a wider variety of climates. This in turn makes it easier to carry foodstuffs and farming.<br />On the opposite extreme, unified societies can be a hindrance. China fell behind modern societies even though it led the world in chemistry, clockworks, exploration, and warfare - all because the ruling classes passed laws to prohibit their development. Conversely, Europe's fragmentation was ripe enough in its diversity to allow good ideas to eventually flourish.<br />Diamond's overview is breathtaking in its breadth and a critical part of our education system. It should be in every child's school texts. It helps dispel, once and for all, the racist notions that pervade common views of history - if only Diamond could keep his own biases out of the book.urish. <br />Diamond's overview is breathtaking in its breadth and a critical part of our education system.

B00005JM09|5.0|I pride myself on my ability to sniff a bad movie out before it hits the screens. After seeing so many movies, reading so many magazines (like Time, Entertainment Weekly, and Cinescape) and listening to so many interviews, you start to realize before a picture even hits the theaters when something is wrong.<br />I'm also a big fan -- I helped create the Terminator: Future Fate D20 Modern campaign setting. What, you haven't gotten a copy? It's free! Go! Go right now and get it (under Freebies)!<br />With Terminator 3, my Spidey sense was tingling.<br />The majority of interviews all centered on \\"how great it is to work with Mr. Schwarzenegger.\\" Uh huh. That's nice. Whenever a director talks about how great the movie is, I get suspicious.<br />Then there's the, \\"we've made a new Terminator and she's a BAAAAAAAABE!\\" This idea already hit the comics and novels. But really, why? Why make her a beautiful woman? Is this going to be The Hidden all over again? The Hidden was great -- but it gave a reason for why the bad guy took on a luscious female form. And don't even get me started on calling her a Terminatrix.<br />And why bring Arnie again? My idea, which was used in the Terminator series of novels out now, was to have Arnie play himself as a human character in present time who is the model for Terminators. Glad S.M. Sterling agrees it's a good idea.<br />So, with all those thoughts going through our heads, Maleficent and I took in a matinee. Whenever we suspect a movie might suck, we go to a matinee so we don't feel like we were suckered. And...<br />We were pleasantly surprised. Terminator 3 is really quite good. It is not as good, in my opinion, as Terminator 2. Maleficent liked Terminator 3 better (she hated the squeaky punk in Terminator 2).<br />This movie follows a T-X (get it, Terminator-X or Terminatrix, although that's a term used only by Connor) who has gone backwards in time to kill all the lieutenants of John Connor since Skynet can't find him.<br />Right away, we know something is different. The T-X has a blue lighting scheme. Her interface looks more like a Windows environment than the old red-code Terminators. She moves with the same eerie patience that the T-1000 did. For the most part, she's expresionless. When she reacts at all, it's disturbing. A scary, beautiful woman. Go figure.<br />The reason for the change is because the future has changed. Skynet's birth came and went. If you saw the last two movies, the world was supposed to have gone to nuclear war already. But thanks to Sarah, Judgment Day didn't happen. Not yet, anyway.<br />Arnold is unbelievably bulked up. I thought maybe they digitally inserted his head on a younger man's body. Nope -- it's him. Naked. 50 years old and the man is bulked. I fear anyone dating his daughters (does he even have daughters?).<br />The movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It focuses on the chase scenes, the running combat between the two Terminators, and the slow recognition of the whole scary plot by Kate Brewster, John's future wife.<br />The movie makes several propositions, which I found interesting. For one, it implies that history is self-correcting. Although John didn't meet Kate right away, he met her again a decade later anyway. Although Skynet wasn't built as a mechanical fortress, it was created as a virus over the Internet instead. In short, the future is NOT what you make of it. It all HAS to happen. It's just a matter of WHEN.<br />The director, Jonathan Mostow, recognizes his core audience. We've all seen Terminator 2. We know how Arnie got his clothes last time. This time, he walks naked into a bar with another fat guy with another shotgun guarding the entrance...and he says without blinking an eye, \\"You're early, go around back.\\" Now the audience is confused. Why isn't he surprised Arnie's naked? We get the answer in a strip club for ladies who are hooting and shouting at the stripper on stage -- who just happens to match Arnie's dimensions. You've got to appreciate a movie that's willing to laugh at itself.<br />Although it has an \\"R\\" rating, this movie isn't that gory. The moments of possible nudity are actually covered up (no, you don't get to see frontal nudity on the Terminatrix). Almost like they were trying hard to make it acceptable for parents to bring their kids to see it. Hmmm.<br />The ending is very well done. I say this a lot -- this is one of those movies that had the strength of its convictions. There's a logical, unpopular conclusion to the events going on in Terminator 3. The movie embraces them.<br />If you're looking for a good popcorn movie and want to see robots beat each other up, this is a film worth seeing. If you're a Terminator fan and want to see more adventures set in the wild and wacky timeline that is constitutes the Terminator universe -- this is a MUST SEE.ons.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|It's a complete mystery to me that so many seem unable to appreciate this movie. The same words crop up time and again. <br />&quot;I was bored&quot;. Well none of the five star reviewers were bored. They obviously saw something there. I wasn't bored for a second. The film has plenty going on, and for those who see it &quot;Lost iin Translation&quot; is unforgettable and one of the best movies of last year.<br />&quot;It wasn't funny&quot;. I thought it was very funny, although in a dry laconic way rather than an immature sixteen year old kind of way. Maybe some were expecting the wrong kind of funny.<br />&quot;It was over-hyped&quot;. Well maybe it was in the US. Not in the many other parts of the world that find it completely excellent. <br />&quot;It was racist&quot;. Was it hell! Having witnessed real racism in the US I must say I find the idea that Americans might be bemused by the manners and mores of a foreign country a laughable one.<br />I guess that most of all I find it hard to understand the vitriol that such a small, personal, subtle film awakens in some people. It's as if they take it as a personal insult that a film like this even gets made. For myself I take it as a personal insult that so much of what Hollywood crams down our throats is so irredeemably stupid. I saw &quot;Taking Lives&quot; last week and THAT was a film that deserves this kind of anger.<br />Why do so many people apparently not have the necessary equipment to understand or &quot;get&quot; this movie? It's absolutely wonderful.<br />(I noticed - by the way - that one reviewer spoke of Charlotte &quot;cheating&quot; on a faithful husband. I think he walked into the wrong cinema in the multiplex or fell asleep and dreamed a different movie.)<br />For those with eyes to see, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a small, sensitive, beautifully written, superbly-acted, well-photographed look at what is almost a love affair, or maybe it is, but in a different way. <br />Scarlett Johannsen is excellent in both this, and &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; - which is also not for those who like more formulaic fare. And Bill Murray is not in a man IN a comedy but a man who uses humour to cope with the world. A lovely, lovely film.
0385507755|5.0|This book was a spontaneous buy for me. I feel that I was lucky enough to end up with the kind of writing that changes lives, much as the situation the author is writing about with his confrontative journey to sobriety. Whether your addiciton is a substance, behavior, feeling or action, this very powerful and moving account of one man's journey can provide many deeply felt opportunities to listen within.<br />Growing up in a family with many addiction issues myself, the book has become a stepping stone for our own family's discussion on the impact of such destructive behaviors - both as instigator and as victim/survivor. My 12 year old daughter chose this book for her 7th grade book report, saying that it speaks to why it is always important to listen every step of the way along life - you could miss something that makes a BIG difference.<br />I hope Mr. Frey is able to continue his literary career and the success of this first book. He has a lot of talent and with a committment similar to addressing his life issues, he will go far. We can all learn much from this man.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I love this cd , Its this bands best since AWAKE in my opinion. Its heavy , melodic &amp; shredding. If you like DREAM THEATER , This isnt the bands best cd ...That was IMAGES &amp; WORDS by far ...But you need to hear this one still , It floors me everytime I check it out &amp; James sounds better than ever on vocals. If your into PROGMETAL or bands like DREAM THEATER , FATES WARNING ...etc....Also search for this cd on AMAZON.COM - MAGNITUDE NINE - &quot; DECODING THE SOUL &quot; , Melodic progmetal cd released by INSIDEOUT in 2004 .
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This album is good and some catchy tunes but my only complaint is that the sexual undertone seems forced.  Britney is a pretty girl and a good singer but this album is not very open.  If she had taken a different approach, it would have been better.  But all and all the album is a good pop CD.  Only buy it though if you are a true fan.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|IRON MAIDEN is still going strong , and is still awsome . Great melodic powerfull , well written metal. This new cd is great , but not as close to my heart as the classics like POWERSLAVE , SOMEWHERE IN TIME , etc .... If your looking for another new melodic metal cd , Check out this cd , search for it here on AMAZON .... MAGNITUDE NINE - &quot; DECODING THE SOUL &quot;  released in 2004 ,
B0001AP12G|5.0|This record was such a surprise for me. I wasn't actually too crazy at first with &quot;Through the Wire&quot; or &quot;Slow Jamz,&quot; but I decided to get the album anyway.  I was blown away by West's creative genius with both his lyrics and his production capabilities. His unique beats have been found all over the rap industry, and he finally is getting the credit he deserves.  Last year was Pharrel's turn for recognition, and this year will be Kanye's.  He avoids the cliche rhymes of money, rims, rides, and instead focuses on deeper issues including religion, education, and family affairs.  His lyrics, even for a &quot;suburban white boy&quot; such as myself, are inspiring and comedic.  Although I haven't experienced the things he raps about, I can appreciate what he has gone through.  I would definitely suggest that everyone buys this album if your sick of Lil Jon owning a rap industry that has turned to shouting and yelling about crunk.
0385512104|3.0|I would not recommend this book to anyone not because it is a bad novel.  It isn't.  It reads well. The concept is interesting: narrating the novel through the POV of an autistic boy.   The chapters are cleverly numbered by prime numbers, which ties in with the novel.  It has interesting illustrations and diagrams to look at. However, I would not recommend this because it disappointed me and I couldn't, in good conscience, tell anyone to read a book I was disappointed in.<br />I guess my disappointment lies in the fact that not only did my book club tout this as a mystery novel but also many of the literary reviews I read as well.  What I was expecting was an exciting roller coaster ride mystery about an autistic boy trying to find the killer of his neighbor's dog and, as he slowly sleuths out the killer, finds himself embroiled in dangerous life threatening situations.  Kind of like Tartt's The Little Friend told from an autistic POV.<br />However, The Curious Incident... is not a mystery in any way, shape or form and because of this, the autistic POV begins to wear thin by the second half of the novel remaining sometimes fascinating yet sometimes tedious. Instead, you get a novel that starts off as a promising murder mystery.  At the first half of the novel, the mystery is solved.  Or rather we're unceremoniously told who is the murderer of the dog.  From that point, the second half of the novel hugely focuses on Christopher  attempting to travel to London by himself.  A difficult task considering Christopher is autistic, hates crowds and can't stand to be touched by people.   I won't tell who the murderer is or why Christopher takes off to London, as these are the only two real surprises of the novel.  I will say overall this was a huge disappointment to me.  I thought I was getting an exciting murder mystery and instead I got a highly readable family melodrama.  Perhaps if this was not pushed as a murder mystery I would have enjoyed it much more.  <br />An interesting read but I wouldn't recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The lead editorial review of the Firefly boxed set does a good job of telling you why you ought to own a copy of this collection but, in reality, it could use far fewer words to get the point across. For anyone who knows the work of the folks involved with making the show (Joss Whedon, Tim Minear, Ben Edlund, etc.) then really that's all you need to point out. This is another stellar series created by a group of people whose collective output has been critically VERY well received.<br />For those people who DON'T know the creators involved... Well, the first question that comes to mind is &quot;Where have you been living?&quot; but perhaps a more relevant question is &quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; Firefly is a show that crosses all KINDS of genre boundaries to create a show that is extraordinarily fun to watch (even if watching it is a little depressing at times since it was really never given a chance on Fox).<br />So, get this boxed set, watch it, enjoy it, and get your Browncoats ready to see Serenity on the big screen in the near future.<br />Thanks, Joss and Company, for creating another classic bright spot on network TV!
6304602944|5.0|I love this film! Its no acadamey award winning preformance from Stallone or Russel, but do you ever watch an action movie expecting that?<br />This film is about 2 cops who work opisote ends of the city and there considered the #1 cops at the time! Stallone plays a sharp dressed cop , and Russel is the laid back smartass more cheaply dressed cop of the other side, but both cops are busting alot of drug deals and its pissing the drug lord whos making it off! (Jack Palance)! So the drug lord sets up a meeting where he will frame LA's two best cops who have done so much damage to his buisness and frame them for murder and make sure there going to jail! But his plan is not to leave them there! Watch it and find out what happens from there on! Also starring a vary of familluer faces like \\"Terri Hatcher\\" and .... errr....recignisable faces! But this is a great combination of two of the best in this great action adventure! For the right price i'd say buy it, but i wouldnt pay too much! It has no extras worth noting or any hidden eggs! I'd recomend a rental if you've never seen it, as it does play on personal taste. And if your into explosians, action, a bit of voilence, and all blended in with some humoures antidotes, then this movie is for you!<br />Just too bad there no bonus material :(
076790592X|5.0|For whatever reason, I was slow on the uptake where this book is concerned. I actually picked it up at a second hand store - and am I ever glad I did.<br />I fell in love with Morrie Schwartz... and through him was reminded how blessed I am to teach adults many lessons similar to what Morrie taught his sociology students.<br />Mitch was one of his students who got caught up in the rush, rush, rush of life and forgot what was really important about life.<br />Some of the richness came from Morrie's own words within Mitch Alborn's narrative.<br />\\"The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let it come in.\\"<br />\\"Love each other or perish\\"<br />\\"Detachment doesn't mean you don't let the experience penetrate you.  On the contrary you let it penetrate you fully.  That's how you are able to leave it.\\"<br />This book is a must read for teachers, a really should read for anyone who is still breathing.... and I am thinking not a bad book for the Junior High Set.
B000002H70|5.0|I just had a listen to this record for the first time in years last night...it's STILL perfect. Best Record of all time??? MAYBE...I think for me it is...I can remember being in college and falling asleep to this record with my girlfriend, she and I used &quot;Love Song&quot; as our wedding song thats how much of an impact this record had on the both of us...I must have played Prayers for Rain, Same Deep Water as You and Disintergration over so many times, it's so addictive...enjoy.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold's book entitled \\"The Lovely Bones\\" depicts a young girl named Susie Salmon, who was raped and murdered in 1973 by her neighbor on her way home from school.  She struggles to watch her family from heaven live their lives without her in it. She observes as her parents grow apart, her sister deals with the downside of being a \\"dead girl's sister\\", and watches her first crush grow up without her.  The plot was simple and easy to follow, but very different and creative.  Instead of forcing the reader to guess throughout the novel who the killer may be, it is revealed almost immediately.  This allows us to concentrate more on Susie's story than worry about who it could have been that killed the poor girl.  Throughout the book the strong connection between Susie and her father is evident, and his life is consumed with finding the killer of his little girl.  The book is suspenseful at times, and does not drag on with unneeded wordiness.  It is relatively short in length, which seems to be just long enough to tell the story.  It was more of a simple than challenging read and once again easy to follow.  Overall, the book was interesting and more creative than the typical suspenseful murder-type novels, and it was quite enjoyable.
6304936362|4.0|If all you know about World War II is Hitler and the Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima then this movie will help show another side of the war.  Not everyone who died in World War II did so in a foxhole or on the beaches of Normandy.  Many young men met their fate in the statosphere, some by themselves and others with their crews.  Memphis Belle is a great movie on showing how men fought and died at thousands of feet above the ground in the war against Hitler and the German war machine.  Although not entirely acurate on how the Memphis Belle flew its last mission, this movie shows just how special this bomber crew was.  Also it shows just how lucky the crew of the Memphis Belle were in being the first B-17 in the Eighth Air Force to finish 25 missions and complete their tour of duty.  This movie is a great tribute to the men who flew this bomber as well as all the men who gave their lives for both sides in the sky over Germany.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Despite the movies flaws it is obvious this reviewer did not pay attention to the film.  At one point it was mentioned that the coven owns a company that produces plasma and cloned blood. So that's how they can pay for their cell phones.
B00005JM0B|2.0|I never like seaqulls that dont bring back the same cast. This movie prooved it. Only Shwartzenegger and whoever the shrink docotor is have returned for the film from the previous 2 great action blockbusters. And it certinly IMO suffred with out the original creator James Camron.<br />The plot takes place 10 years or so since the last blockbuster movie T2; Judgment day. John Conner is a loner, his mother has passed away and he is his familly Toto! I strongly beleive the intrest to this film is the fact that there is a female terminator, and theres guys enjoying seeing her in tight clothing. That kind of image never works for me so the movie failed in its attempt to sell scenes in a uncalled for way! I'd like to see alot more woman become action stars, there sure isnt enough of them, but this new terminator is hardly threatning at all, and unlike in T2 with the t-1000..this soupposed new upgraded terminator looks more downgraded!<br />A new Terminator has been sent back to not just kill John Conner but also another leader of the resistance and a bunch of other people too! And of coarse Arnold is sent back once more as a terminator to protect them.<br />The movie suffered in alot of plot ideas IMO, I dont care that Arnold returned...with few SFX shots gave some great action seaqunces, the SFX where no where near as impressive as the ground breaking SFX that T2 provided us with! This plot also rueins the whole genre of the Terminator. Particuly the most i did not like was the ending to this film. The ending IMO has been rueind, and has created a non beleivable ending, unlike the last 2 movies. If they make a 4th movie, they should consider highly about going back in time to prevent the events that happend in this film, other wise this movie has rueind the terminator story lines IMO.<br />Rent it first, many people judge this movie on Arnie and a female in tight cloths to sell a sexy image rather then concentrate on important and significant things to make the movie beleiable. The begining is kind of cool, then it drifts, then its going no where, then it picks up, then the end ruens the entire saga! Only a 4th movie can fix the bad idea on how to finish this film IMO!<br />Bonus features are forgetable, and its no wonder they cut a few of the deleted scenes, if they had have been included the movie would have done harm to the terminator saga even further!
B0000256RB|5.0|The music of Ayreon doesn't fit into any easy categories. . .  Symphonic metal?  Power prog?  Heavy music?  Psychedelic space visions?  In my opinion, this is what heavy metal was always destined to mature into, if only most of it hadn't degenerated into merely loud head-banging.<br />Whatever it is, I love it.  I've collected most of Arjen Anthony Luccassen's recordings, and have to rate this one as the pinnacle -- at least so far.  The whole two-disc set is more polished and consistent than Ayreon's earlier recordings.  It's very much a concept album that leads the listener on a journey, not merely a collection of tunes.<br />If you like Into the Electric Castle (and you will!), the next thing to look for should be The Dream Sequencer.  I consider it a very close second out of Ayreon's catalog.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie is boring and stupid. Don't buy this DVD or rent the movie. I can tell you right here everything that happens in the movie so save your money. Bill Murray goes to Japan to film a commercial for a local whiskey. He is bored and meets the wife of a photographer who is also bored. They go together to a few stupid places and develop some platonic relationship. In the end he leaves to the U.S. and she stays in Japan. The end. Sucks huh? I can only say that this movie was done becuse of the Coppola name behind it. If some unknown would have written this junk they would have been laughed at.
B0001932ZA|2.0|Stephen King story converted to an Arnold Schwarzenegger action film? I think that says enough.<br />If you were expecting more, you are going to be disappointed. If you can let go, suspend disbelief and just enjoy the total &quot;cheesy-ness&quot;, then you should have no reason to not enjoy the film.<br />But let's get to the important stuff. 2 discs? Given the pathetically little amount of extras, this didn't deserve 2 discs, not when the clowns in Hollywood were originally putting out two versions of a film on one, two-sided disc. Oh, how I wish for a return to the early days of the DVD.<br />The &quot;Game Theory&quot; documentary was fluff. End of story.<br />Why not more info about the making of the movie? Why not some mini-documentary on Arnold? Why not develop more sections along the lines of the &quot;Meet the Stalkers&quot; extra?<br />Instead, we are subjected to liberal political dribble in the form of the &quot;Lockdown on Main Street&quot; documentary? When are the &quot;enlightened&quot; Illuminati of Hollywood, California going to realize that they are not representative of the rest of America?<BR>Why is it that there is only 2 other reviews that mention this worthless tidbit of an extra?<br />Wait for a different version of the film. One where you aren't going to be subjected to the less than subtle attempt at calling you a moron for not standing up in revolt against the Patriot Act.
B000002LHT|5.0|Certanly not as bad a record as everyone seems to think.  All the songs on Brain Drain are excellent Ramones classics.  The problem with this album is the production.  <br />The drums are mixed considerably louder than anything else on the album for some reason, and the guitar drowns out the bass completly.  The worst example of this poor mixing is on &quot;All Screwed up&quot;.  It often sounds more like a grunge/metal band than classic Ramones punk rock.<br />Besides the poor production, I can't think of anything wrong with this album.  The songs are all classic Ramones tunes!  I believe in miracles, Ignorance is Bliss, Merry Christmas, Punishment fits the Crime, Palasadies park, ect. are all killer songs!<br />In fact, one of the Ramones biggest hits is on here: &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;.  The production on this song is much cleaner (a differnt producer did this song).  That song alone would make the album worthwhile.  <br />I love Brain Drain.  And sadly it was Dee Dee's last.  Introducing CJ and not breaking up was a great move for the Ramones.  <br />Get this album!
0060012218|5.0|This book was truly fantastic.  There are very few adult characters in it, just teenagers.  \\"The Geography Club\\" discusses all sorts of issues, from popularity to homophobia.  It's also a very interesting story, centered around Russel, a secretly gay teen and how he meets other gay people.  There is always the underlying question:  \\"Is it better to be a nasty popular person, or an unpopular good person?\\"  In the end Russel has to choose, because being himself won't make him popular.
B000001E7V|5.0|After owning this album since 1996, I can safely say...This is the best album I own.  Hands down.
0385504209|5.0|In settling on a title for this review, I was at a loss to find the right adjective. Compelling?  Intriguing?  Informative?  Gripping?  All of the above, actually. I settled on &quot;great,&quot; because I truly believe this book will be read as a classic of this era.<br />The book is an amazing learning experience, opening my mind to realms of thought and beliefs I never knew anyone espoused.  As one who has always loathed history books, the education garnered from Brown's writing was assimilated without a fuss.  Indeed, I absorbed willingly.<br />I enjoyed a similar experience from James Goldman's brilliant play, &quot;The Lion In Winter.&quot; It's apparently useful to have the characters brought to life and given dimesion, not some dry account of their actions and their relevance to history.<br />The plot, stripped of its embellishments, is basic enough. Even trite.  A man is accused of a crime he didn't commit, and with the aid of his brilliant, charming lady cryptographer, struggles to prove his innocence.  But fiction readers of all stripes will find something to appeal, from mystery to history, and even a love story.<br />Dan Brown will prove to be recognized as one of the greatest writers of our time.
B0001AP12G|3.0|I was kinda in and out as far as feeling this album. I see a lot of reviews up here saying this album is about something... there has always been MC's talking about &quot;something&quot; such as his guests like mos def, kweli and common. Most of the beats on here are tight and a lot of the lyrics are on point, but it has its faults. skits kinda pointless. Also I was left kinda confused... in &quot;Get em high&quot; he feat. kweli and common (common owned the track) and he uses kweli in his first verse while tryin' to pick up a female and even feat. kweli in the track, but then in &quot;breathe in breathe out&quot; he disses kweli and mos. how are u gonna invite their style into your raps and then diss them for what they're about?<br />he says:<br />Golly, more of that bull**** ice rap<BR>I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli<BR>But is it cool to rap about gold<BR>If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali?<br />overall this cd is 50/50, but i think more thought should have been put behind the album.
B00005JMX4|5.0|Saw the sneek preview for this movie in my area on 3/20/04.  Movie's plot was fun, and good acting from both main characters.  Hope to see Elisha Cuthbert in more movies.  Plan on seeing it second time in theaters cannot say that about many movies these days.
B0000020C4|5.0|Ever since this 10th Anniv. Celebration was broadcasted on public television back in 1995 I have been totally in love with Les Miserables. This soundtrack to that wonderful performance is just as exceptional as the production itself. The best voices from past productions (including the one and only Jean Valjean Colm Wilkenson and the highly acclaimed Michael Ball as Maurius) were all pulled together for this anniv production and the result is astounding. For those like me who have heard mainly the Les Mis soundtrack with the Original Broadway Cast - use this set of CDs to re-discover of charm of Les Miserables. If you are looking for your first soundtrack for Les Mis - this is the one to get. I highly recommend this soundtrack and the DVD as well. This Dream Cast performance at the Royal Albert Hall really IS a dream and everything else as well.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|In May of last year, I was very excited to see Matrix Reloaded. It turned out to only have two cool scenes in it.Then at the end of the movie a preview of REVOULTION was shown. I figured they were saving the best for last.Boy..was I ever wrong. This movie died by the first 5 minutes. Then it got worse,how can you ever get worse from death? But of course, it had to end somehow, someway. Matrix pulled it off in many ways, but for the worse. I believe this film shoveled itself into the grave. I give it the one star due to the fact that this would very well be the end of this dumb-drowned series. I put it as if I saw a bad joke that was told to by a person with no scence of humor....
B000002WPI|5.0|The first thing I want to say is Hip Hop and Rap are not the same thing. Lil Flip is Rap, Ying Yang Twins is Rap, Three 6 Mafia is Rap. They have no lyrical substance just booty shaking beats. Nas is Hip Hop, Jay Z (WAS) hip hop, Big L, Raekwon, KANYE WEST. Only people who been in the &quot;hood&quot; can apprechiate the art of Hip Hop. Lyrics that actually require you to use your mind and beats that make you feel &quot;gangsta&quot;, This album is a Hip Hop classic. And if you don't know that....You a weak ass N****!!!!!
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Godsmack's initial release will always be the best, but Faceless is definitely better than their second CD, Awake.  Personal favorites are Releasing the Demons and Make Me Believe.
0385512104|5.0|Mark Haddon's debut takes the form of this startling fresh and new book that is destined to climb higher and higher on the bestseller lists as the months pass.  Reminiscent of THE LIFE OF PI or McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, the point of view and telling of the story is similar and equally as unique.  But what is so amazing about this book is the way the author handles his material, for some of the ideas and scenes in any other author's hands could easily turn grotesque and off-putting.  Not so with THE CURIOUS INCIDENT.  <br />Well-paced, with excellent characterizations and food for thought like nothing else out there, this is the top of the list in my opinion.  Would also recommend THE SLEEPING FATHER and THE HOUSE ON MANGO STREET
B000002MUN|5.0|Call me cheesy, but I can't help feel a certain aura when listening to Tom Petty's Wildflowers. Back in High School, this was the album to listen to when we got stoned. The odd thing is that whenever I come back home from traveling, the first thing I do is listen to Wildflowers. The album has truly been a part of my life for a while now.
0385510438|5.0|I wasn't expecting much based on some of the negative reviews about this book, and perhaps that was why I enjoyed it so much.  True, it's not at all like Grisham's thriller genre, but it does have the courtroom element and this, coupled with his styles in &quot;A Painted House&quot; and other great reads of his, makes it enjoyable and fun.  The story itself is not that unusual but the masterful telling of it reminds me of &quot;King of Torts.  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Would also recommend &quot;In This Mountain&quot; and a great new book I just discovered:  &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; by Jackson McCrae.
B00012QM8G|3.0|Liam Neeson is excellent once again but I just didnt think this was as good as expected. Also I dont see why there was so many nude shots. There not the shots you'd expect in a holocaust film, tortured and deprived humans. They are straight up nude woman! Probably the only movie Speilberg could get the chance to film it so he made sure to take advantage of it. Also, the german soldiers just act like goons. Their child-like gullibiliy was way to over the top for me and made it all less believable. Overall this is another totally hollywoodized portrayal of a true and more dramatic story but because of the subject matter it is unthinkable to call this anything but classic.
B000068FUM|5.0|The album is a masterpiece- country-folk tinged psychedelic<BR>rock. The abilities of the songwriting team, Louris and Olson, are perfectly balanced. Marc Olson's simple yet very effective and wise and uplifting take on country folk tradition.<BR>Gary Louris with his intellectual artistic spin on his experiences, in rock and roll format.<BR>The combination results in an album which is ambitious while being reflective and painfully honest. <BR>It embraces it's heratige and the spectrum of experiences <br />that are autobiographical and results in being more than merely insightful, it is an awe inspiring showcase of the bittersweet nature in events and meanings that wrote the album and that is why 'Tomorrow the green grass'  Is so profoundly real.
B00005JKC3|5.0|Let me start out by saying you must go into this movie with an open mind, don't think it's going to be another Spider-man or X-men type movie, it's got WAY more depth and story then they both do combined. And that seems to be why some people didn't enjoy this film, because it wasn't a popcorn type film like they thought it was going to be. Again go into it with an open mind.<BR>The original is changed some from the comic book Hulk, but at the same time it still tells the same story, just in an updated way.<BR>The visuals are jaw dropping, the all CGI Hulk is the best use of CGI to date in a movie (right up along side of Gollum and surpassing him at times), and the overall visuals of the movie are also great looking.<BR>The acting is top notch. Nick Nolte gives the performance of his life in this film, and the rest of the crew is also fantastic. Banner (played by Eric Bana) has a tough job to do since his character is emotionally repressed, which would be very hard to pull off on screen without looking to boring, but he pulls it off well. And if you think an all CGI character can't act, think again. The Hulk shows more emotions then most actors to in movies today.<BR>The sound track is also amazing. The score is done by Elfman and it's fantastic, one of the better scores that I've heard in a long time.<BR>And last the editing, it's the most amazing editing I've seen so far. The way Ang Lee uses comic type panels in the movie is both fresh and it works. They usually show either more then one thing that is going on at one time, or different things going on at different time periods. Again, it's amazing what they did with the editing.<BR>Everthing in this movie is top notch, it's a must see, and Ang Lee (the director) should have been nominated for some awards, but since all movie awards are complete crap it didn't happen.<BR>I'd give this movie a 10/10, it's as perfect as a comic book movie as you can have.

B000059ZLH|5.0|This is quite possibly the best live dvd ive ever bought of any band.  This dvd really beats there studio work, and really delivers the live dream theater experience.  These guys are amazing musicians and this dvd shows it.  They have no trouble reproducing there studio work live.  Great dvd.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Say what you will about this album, it still sold more than many other records this past year. <br />You have to remember Madonna is the ONLY artist to survive the 80's and still be at the top. Michael Jackson is on his way to jail, Whitney is back in drug re-hab and Prince hasn't had a hit since 1994.<br />Never underestimate the artist who has had more Top 10 hits than anyone except 60's icons Elvis and The Beatles. Madonna has moved over 250 million records worldwide - American Life may have been all but ignored by the USA but in Europe it has been a success spawning 3 Top 3 singles on the UK charts and a fourth peaking at #11. Most artists would dream of that success. Also remember American Life has seen 3 singles go #1 on the Billboard Single Sales chart - forget airplay - who needs it!<br />Madonna's re-Invention tour showcasing American Life and for the first time in a decade many of her older hits kicks off in May - if you haven't got American Life yet, get it.<br />Recommended tracks are Nothing Fails, Hollywood, Die Another Day and her record-breaking 33rd US #1 Billboard Dance Chart hit &quot;Love Profusion&quot;

B00003CXAA|1.0|O.K, before you look at the score I gave this and go scrolling down to the next hight flyer, give me a chance, and  hear me out.<BR>I am a huge movie fan. Any type of movie I generally enjoy. (Of course modern hollywood get's a little tedious).<BR>Anyway I had heard so mucha bout the Godfather (As had anyone else) that when I finally got a hold of the first one I couldn't wait to jam it in.<BR>Now I've seen Apocolypse Now and quite frankly I think it's amazing. Despite the fact that I feel the end is something to be desired, I still love the movie and can see why Copella is so highly acclaimed.<BR>But let's face it people, the Godfather is tedious and boring.<BR>Now for all I know I will watch it again, change my mind and forever regret writing this, but not yet.<BR>I thought it was too long and slow, Al Pacino was highly over-rated as always (Don't get me wrong I still like him) and the film didn't really go anywhere.<BR>The only reason that I can imagine people falling to there knees over it, is that it's a film about the mafia. Since it was on eof the first that really took the whole thing seriously people enjoyed it because they thought that what they were watching was real.<BR>I don't know.<BR>I asked someone recently why they thought it was the best film ever made and he couldn't say. It looked to me like he was repeating his fathers words, as I'm sure so many others are.<BR>Basically, I don't want to put you off it, I f you like it, and you know you like it then by all means buy it. But you have to admit it's over rated.<BR>The best film ever made? Come on people, Reservoir Dogs strangles this film and Pulp Fiction kills it.<BR>It's boring and you know it. But if you can sit through nice cinematography for hours on end, time after time without anything happening, then feel free.<br />P.S<BR>Keep posted for when I see it again. You may see my stars racking up.<BR>But probobaly not.
B000000OSG|5.0|I don't know which album I like more, Use Your Illusion I or II...but this album rocks hard either way.  All the songs are classic GNR and with only one downfall ('My World'), this album is one of the best albums ever.<BR>Guns N Roses go back to their roots of harsh and brutal truth in their lyrics with the pin pointed 'Civil War' and the stirring up sadness anthem 'Estranged'.  Guns N Roses cover Dylan's 'Knockin' On Heaven's Door' and is much, MUCH better than the original.  'Get In The Ring' is somewhat of a letter to the magazine writers of that time, for example Hit Parader and Circus.  They don't hold back a bit and it's an outrageous angry song.  The perfect slow songs of 'So Fine' and 'Don't Cry (alt lyrics)' on the same album as the genius 'You Could Be Mine' and 'Breakdown' ... you damn right.  This album has it all, it's got everything and I'd recommend it to ANYONE.  If I could, I'd buy it for the world because it's that DAMN good.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Aquilera risked all and managed to pull it off.  Anyone who likes pop music can appreciate this album.  Stripped offers an eclectic array of music remenescent of Janet Jackson's Rythm Nation (Interludes and all).  I will even go as far as dousing those critics who called &quot;Dirrty&quot; one of the worst songs.  In my opinion, it is one of the best songs on the album.  It was catchy, it was picking up on the hip-hop element (i.e. rrrr-ty) and Christina's voice was raw and powerful.  I don't think most critics of the song hate the song, I believe, they either hated the video, or Christina's new image.  Beautiful is definately, the stand out song; simple with a nice chorus.  Still, those who are yet to hear the album, should give a listen to &quot;Walk Away.&quot;  It's one of the most well-sung songs I've heard in years. &quot;Infatuation,&quot; which I just recently started hearing on the radio, is a great latin-pop song.  Reminds we of J-LO's &quot;Aint if funny.&quot;   In fact, every track on the album, tells a different story and genre never seems to be important: rock, pop, r&amp;b, even metal.  That's what an album should offer.  I think when history tells itself, fans will look back on this album as a true gem, offering something for everybody.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|'Colour and The Shape' is the Foo Fighters best album to date.  With perfect songs like 'My Hero' and 'February Stars'.  Dave's voice is rockish yet haunting at the same time.  Foo Fighters song writing ability shines on this album with the brilliantly done song 'Everlong', 'My Poor Brain' and 'Hey Johnny Park'.  A must for any Foos fan.
B0001ADAVK|1.0|Watching the trailers for this movie I didn't think it would be very good, but I was quite prepared to have my mind changed, particularly since it had such a good cast.  The story is obviously taken from The Dead Poet's Society, but this time given a feminist edge.  That feminist edge is Julia Roberts, a thoroughly modern miss who takes a class of art students at a conservative college, only to realise that it's really just a finishing school.  There's an appropriate array of stereotypes: the nasty one (Dunst), the wild one (Gyllenhaal) and the nice one (Stiles).<br />The greatest travesty of Mona Lisa Smile is that it wastes the talents of such brilliant actresses.  It doesn't even seem to appreciate them.  Roberts, showing such spark in Erin Brockavich, does good work here but she's just too modern to fit into a 50's set piece.  The worst hit by it all is Kirsten Dunst, whose character seems to be repeatedly punished for refuting Roberts' feminist agenda and has some truly abysmal dialogue, especially when confronting her mother with a picture of the Mona Lisa.  Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal come out of the whole mess relatively unscathed though.  Stiles has always seemed to be a good actress in need of a good film, and here is no exception.  Her poise, voice and mannerisms are impressively realistic, and her talk with Roberts that maybe her feminism isn't always the right course of action is the best scene in the movie.  Gyllenhaal is just wonderful.  She imbues her character with an almost manic depressive quality that's not in the script.  It's all her, and I can only hope that after her startling turn in Secretary that she moves on to bigger and better things.<br />Of course, the real problem with Mona Lisa Smile is that it's too self-consciously 'worthy' and seems to be begging for an Oscar in almost every scene.  Although there are a couple of scenes where the film comes alive, it's too few and far between, and once you've left the theatre and look backon it you realise what a shallow exercise it was.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Every once and while you buy an album and you expect it to be good and then you pop it in and after it's finished you are completely blown away and even after 7-8 years it's still in your CD player.  This is one of those times.  Pearl Jam shows to the world once AGAIN that they are the best damn band that ever lived.  'No Code' is hard, beautiful, haunting, experiemental and genius all at the same time.  With the hard songs 'Hail, Hail' and 'Habit', beautiful songs such as 'Who You Are' and 'Off He Goes', haunting songs like 'I'm Open' and 'Present Tense', experiemental songs such as 'Mankind' and genius songs like 'Smile' and 'Around The Bend'.  This album is by far one of my favourites of all time and make it yours:  BUY IT.  Eddie Vedder is the best frontman ever and with guitarists like McCready and a bassist like Ament to back him up, it isn't hard to say that Pearl Jam is the best.  Legends in the making, Pearl Jam will be around for a long time and as Vedder plays with Neil Young, someone of my age is going to be playing alongside Vedder in a couple of years without a doubt.  Perfect CD.
0385512104|5.0|Prior to reading this book, I knew little about autism but I have seen such children and their behavior before... which makes it easier to relate to the book. I must say, the book is a delight! It's different, light and interesting because its evolving around a boy who's not our usual Tim or Jim in high school..started with an unusual dog murder..very interesting ideas really! Good book! I just kept reading it non-stop!!I love the book and I definitely recommend it.By the way, the hardcover was worth it. Nice :)  Enjoy the book!
B000002H97|5.0|This is my personal favourite Metallica album.  Every song on it is pure brillance.  I love it and that's all there really is to say.  Just buy it and you'll understand.  Speechless for genius pieces of art like this.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|The best from Briney ever...My favorite tracks are 1,2,3,5,6,8 and 9. Ok trax are 4,7,10 and 13, wack trax are 11 and 12. all in all a good cd.
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N Roses are one of the best damn bands ever and were the best at their peak in the late 80s early 90s.  'Appetite', the album which made GNR is now a classic.  (...) 'Appetite' is a brilliant mix of hard rock and metal with brutal honesty and genius lyrics.<BR>Unfortunately, GNR are no more but this album will have you rocking for the next decade.  It's NEVER too late to pick up this CD and get into Guns N Roses either.  I had the pleasure of seeing the new Guns N Roses in November of 2002 and it was the best experience of my life.  I wish I could've seen them when Slash was in the band though because he's an amazing guitarist.  These songs performed live just shows you how much these guys deserve all the awards in the world just for making hard rock songs that are this good after all these years.<BR>About the songs, my personal favourites would have to be 'Think About You', 'Out Ta Get Me' and 'It's So Easy' but all the other songs on the album are genius.  'You're Crazy' was twisted up a bit for the original is actually quite slow.  There are NO slow songs on this album, this is a PURE hard rock/metal album that is PERFECT for in the car ESPECIALLY going or coming back from ANY concert.  It's the CD I always put in after concerts or before to get you hyped.  If you want to get hyped, pop this baby in.  Brilliant guitar work, excellent vocals and genius lyrics = heaven.  Or just GNR.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I actually really enjoyed this CD. I was not Britney's biggest fan but sinc &quot;slave&quot; i started to kind of like her. I use to despise her music but now i'm infatuated with it. This album may not show a &quot;personal Britney&quot; but she did co-write on this cd. My favorite songs are ME AGAINST THE MUSIC, I GOT THAT (BOOM BOOM),definately SHOWDOWN,EARLY MORNIN,TOUCH OF MY HAND and TOXIC. Other songs that are good are SHADOW,OUTRAGEOUS,THE HOOKUP and BREATH ON ME. BRAVE NEW GIRL is just wack, EVERYTIME is a mush mush ballad but that's about it. All in All a good cd.
B0000028UK|5.0|I said Pearl Jam is God?  No.  This album is the best follow-up album ever created and known to man.  Following in the footsteps of their first album 'Ten', Pearl Jam combines hard rock with down-to-earth truth along with some slower songs that just show off Eddie Vedder's illuminating vocals.  The song writing on this album is some of Pearl Jam's best with the songs 'Small Town' and 'Dissident'.  Here's a more detailed song review:<br />01 Go - the starter is a hard hitter, very Pearl Jamish and grunge.<br />02 Animal - Vedder stresses the chorus, it's brilliant.<br />03 Daughter - one of Pearl Jam's most known songs, a very discriptive story telling song, excellent<br />04 Glorified G - one of my favourite Pearl Jam songs.  A fast paced fun song to listen to, some people may mix up the lyrics but the message is clear to me<br />05 Dissident - check out the amazing lyrics<br />06 WMA - I don't know why a lot of people don't give this song a chance, it's actually really well written and performed.  I love the 'police man' part<br />07 Blood - a lot of people I know don't really enjoy this song, I don't know why.  Always been one of my favourites on this album.  Very hard, Vedder is screaming with angst, pure grunge at its best<br />08 Rearviewmirror - though this song has been a bit overplayed (since it was my sister's favourite for years), it's still an amazing song.<br />09 Rats - Ament shines on bass on this classic Pearl Jam song.  I love the lyrics as well<br />10 Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town - often short formed to 'Small Town', this slower, fun-to-sing-to song is one of Pearl Jam's best.  I don't know a single person on this Earth who doesn't enjoy this song<br />11 Leash - another hard song, some people get the lyrics messed up for in the booklet it says 'lucky face' but we all know what Vedder is saying.  A perfect song for the car<br />12 Indifference - ends on a slower note.  Actually very sad, amazing lyrically and musically.  Vedderknows how to put his voice to work in any instance.<br />In all, get this album and you won't be disappointed.  One of the best Pearl Jam albums!

B000002AS3|4.0|Liam Gallagher sneered 'I'm a rock and roll star', Noel Gallagher gloated that Oasis were the best band in the world. Both were so convincing, we all believed them. The sheer audacity of the Gallagher brothers to self-proclaim themselves as rock's kingpins shook the very foundations of the music industry in the mid 90's. The stage was set, Oasis had arrived with a loud bang. 'Definitely Maybe' was to complete what the Stone Roses had only managed in the UK, hard-edged sons of Manchester unleashing rock and roll fury on the music world. Their debut is ear-piercing, brazen, and seeping with arrogance, hailing upon the spirit of the rock gods for a pure and distilled brand of rock and roll. Noel Gallagher and Bonehead sets the mood with brash lead/rhythm guitar-riffs, equal parts classic rock, glam, and garage-rock, making for a raw crunchy guitar wall-of-sound. Just like crackling thunder, primal and spine-chilling, powerful yet jolting. But at the sametime non-threatening and palatable, arms held high and swaying, a tribute to rock's icons, a homage to jukebox anthems, a collective call to arms for voices raised in song. Liam's vocals are like some swashbuckling rogue, more swagger than substance, more attitude than emotion, self-assured and cocky...which is basically the essence of rock itself. 'Definitely Maybe' is an admirable blend of sheer bloody-mindedness, subtle seduction, and unsettling yet infectious guitar prowess/energy. This CD endures only because rock's flame continues to burn, and every so often, we need a reminder the beast is merely lying dormant waiting to be unleased again.

0385504209|5.0|I had heard so many wonderful blurbs about this book and after reading it for myself I can't give it enough praise either!<br />The opening chapters of the books reveals the dying moments of the curator of the famous Louvre museum.  This curator holds a secret that dates back to the days when Christ walked the Earth.  However, with the death of the curator the secret is in jeopardy of being lost forever.  Before he succumbs to death, the curator must find a way to pass along this secret and deliver it into the right hands.<br />Dan Brown takes the reader on a thrilling, nail biting journey chock full of historical references and fascinating symbolism.  You won't be able to put this book down!
B000007ODY|5.0|There is not much to say! This is Brahms with Berlin Philharmonic and Karajan. Which means - the very best Brahms!
B00005Q66T|3.0|It seems as if Warner Brothers and Madonna just decided to throw together some tracks just to cash-in from the fans and the success of the 'Music' project and the 'Drowned World Tour.'<br />First of all, why is it even called GHV2?  Greatest Hits Volume 2?  There isn't even a Greatest Hits Volume 1.  There's 'The Immaculate Collection' - which covers the years 1983 to 1990 - and that misses a lot of hit singles.  The compilation should have been titled 'TIC2' - 'The Immaculate Collection 2.'  The 'GHV2' title just annoys me!  It doesn't fit!<br />Besides the title, the tracklisting has major, major flaws.  Why not put the tracks in chronological order like on 'The Immaculate Collection'?  Then perhaps I wouldn't have to complain about which songs were included and which ones were not.  They at least would be in chronological order and would seem more fitting.<br />Now on to the tracklisting.  I'm actually glad that single edits and radio mixes were used on most of the tracks, except in a few cases.  That AWFUL \\"Human Nature (Radio Version)\\" has got to go!  It can go in the vaults and never come out again!  What I don't understand is why Warner Bros. just didn't use the \\"Video Edit\\" of the track.  It's radio-friendly because it bleeps out the word \\"sh*t\\" with a door slam.  Very clever edit.  Instead, the whole \\"I'm not your b*tch don't hang your sh*t on me\\" part is completely removed!  Ack!<br />I'm a bit \\"eh\\" about how \\"Ray Of Light\\" was edited for radio.  It sounds a bit choppy, namely at the ending.  But that I can let slide.<br />Why do we get all these edits of the tracks until we get to the end of the disc?  Suddenly we are back to the full-length album version of \\"Don't Tell Me.\\"  The 'Radio Edit' omits the orchestral outro.  It would have worked here just fine.  I can't say that I like the 'Radio Edit' of \\"What It Feels Like A Girl.\\"  Thankfully it wasn't included here!  Nonetheless, a more appropriate edit would have been fine.<br />Warner Bros./Madonna were a bit greedy for only including 15 tracks, whereas 'The Immaculate Collection,' despite it's many many flaws, included 15 classics plus 2 new songs.  Why no new songs Madonna?  Okay, perhaps she didn't have time to record anything new.  That's fine.  Then at least another single from the 'Music' album should have been pulled and included here.  Fans were calling out for \\"Impressant Instant\\" as a single ever since the album leaked onto the Internet.  Warner Bros./Madonna decided to only release 3 singles from the album.<br />So, there was no lead single to promote this collection.  What were they thinking?  This collection could have been as big as 'The Immaculate Collection' had they bothered to release a single to promote it - not some 'GHV2 Thunderpuss Mix' which radio refused to play.<br />Okay, so no compilation is really perfect.  We all have our favorites.  But realistically, I think many fans agree that this could have been SO MUCH BETTER!  Here's what I think would have worked and gave Warner Bros. many more millions in sales:<br />01  Erotica (Radio Edit)<br />02  Deeper And Deeper (7\\" Edit)<br />03  Rain (Video Edit)<br />04  I'll Remember (Theme From 'With Honors')<br />05  Secret (Edit)<br />06  Take A Bow (Edit)<br />07  Bedtime Story (Edit)<br />08  Human Nature (Video Edit)<br />09  You'll See (Edit)<br />10  Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Miami Mix Edit)<br />11  Frozen (Edit)<br />12  Ray Of Light (Radio Edit)<br />13  The Power Of Good-Bye<br />14  Beautiful Stranger (William Orbit Radio Edit)<br />15  American Pie (from 'The Next Best Thing' soundtrack)<br />16  Music<br />17  Don't Tell Me (Radio Edit)<br />18  Impressive Instant (or whatever track they wanted to pick from the 'Music' project to promote this project!)<br />If there was/is room, I would have included \\"You Must Love Me (Single Version).\\"  I hate to omit this one, but there's only so much space.  I personally would have picked \\"Bad Girl\\" for this collection as well, but \\"Rain\\" is thebigger hit from the 'Erotica' project.  Plus, anything more than 15 tracks is a bit too generous for Warner Bros.<br />We already have \\"You'll See\\" and \\"I'll Remember\\" on another Madonna collection, 'Something To Remember.'  However, these tracks were first featured on a Madonna album for the first time there.  Plus, \\"I'll Remember\\" is one of Madonna's biggest hits ever, spending 4 weeks at #2 in the USA in early 1994.  So, I see no reason why they can't be repeated here.  \\"Take A Bow\\" and \\"Rain\\" may be a bit redundant, but \\"Take A Bow\\" remains Madonna's biggest U.S. #1 hit to date - even though I would personally exclude it from the tracklisting altogether.<br />Also, I removed \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" simply because it was a very recent single, and I think that to keep the 'Music' catalog sales up, it should only be available there.  I also removed \\"Drowed World/Substitute For Love\\" because it just shouldn't be here.  It wasn't even a single in the USA and many other countries.<br />I included \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Miami Mix Edit)\\" because it was this dance mix version that brought the song into the USA Billboard Top Ten.  This mix was hot at radio and still remains only on the maxi-single release.  Time for an album debut.<br />I also included \\"American Pie.\\"  Even though it wasn't a major USA hit, it was a major hit all around the world and would have fit perfectly on this collection.<br />With all that said, the collection as it stands today works well perhaps more so with a \\"Best Of\\" title than a \\"Greatest Hits\\" title.  I think that the artwork and album cover are fantastic!  Too bad the tracklisting didn't match up.' project.

B0000028M7|5.0|Them Bones - Perfect opener.  Nihilistic and anguished.  The first verse lays out the entire album.  Scary video.<br />Dam That River - Just can't get myself to like this track.  With the straight ahead drumming and toned down wah, it doesn't belong.  I wish this track was replaced with their soundtrack, &quot;A Little Bitter&quot;.<br />Rain When I Die - Extremely powerful vocal performance over a great riff.<br />Down in a Hole - The thinking man's power ballad.  Haunting harmony. Best moment on the album is when the lyrics of the bridge fuse with the chorus and they realize that, &quot;Lord I WANT to be inside... Down in a hole&quot;, and that tragic-sounding outro riff begins.  Pure genius.  Unfortunately, the video's boring.<br />Sickman - I love this track for its fast, complex drumming and the thoughtful lyrics. Kinney's awesome here.  The pre-chorus screaming is almost too much to bear.<br />Rooster - Not my personal favorite, but still a great song and great video.<br />Junkhead - The sarcastic &quot;And it ain't so bad&quot; at the end brings a smile to my face, which I desperately need after the depressing solo.<br />Dirt - Perfect title track.  Wow, Jerry REALLY loathes himself.  The pistol-tasting imagery coupled with the, &quot;One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be&quot; refrain could bring down the happiest person.<br />Godsmack - Might be the most hopeful song on the album (heh).  Crank up the bass on this one.  Mike Starr really pounds it.<br />Hate to Feel - Great track. Kind of bluesy and &quot;Hendrixian&quot;. Wow, Layne REALLY loathes himself.  Solid drumming and a mind-boggling solo.<br />Angry Chair - Yes, the lyrics are bleak, but I always see Layne chuckling and shaking his head when he sings, &quot;Lost my mind, yeah. I don't mind.&quot;  To me, the song is ultimately about acceptance. Another boring video though.<br />Would? - Jerry's masterpiece. This song IS grunge.  It's ten times more uncomfortable than anything Pearl Jam or Nirvana ever recorded.  The riff is awesome, the vocals (Jerry sings verses and Layne takes over on chorus) are powerful, the bass is menacing and the drums stand out.  Oh, and the video fits the song perfectly too.<br />So there it is, my take on Dirt.  If you don't have it, get it.<BR>One more thing, this is a great weight lifting album!
0380789035|3.0|I liked it. In fact, the more I think about it, the more time passes, the more I like it.<br />It didn't hit me over the head. Although I cared what happened next, I didn't stay up late reading. I didn't sneak off to bathroom, asking my husband to watch the baby &quot;for a few minutes.&quot;<br />I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about - pages and pages of quotable blurbs written by reviewers I've never heard of. &quot;An important, essential book&quot; is a bit overblown. &quot;Keeps the reader turning pages&quot; is somewhat more lowkey, but a meaningless comment, really, to make about any adequate book.<br />There's nothing bad to say about this book. But it's lingering with me. The story's a giant metaphor, of course, which I'm still enjoying unravelling. This book is aging well.<br />Gaiman paints America with the reverence only an outsider could muster.<br />Gaiman's no literary genius, but he knows his craft well enough. It's idea that drives this book, not language. (More books might be better off if they had ideas like these.) I don't really see how American Gods could win both the Bram Stoker Award for Best Horror Novel (the only horrific element is that dead woman who keeps hanging around) and the Hugo Award for Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Novel (there's certainly no science about it, and the fantasy is the kind that pervades our daily lives) - I'd sooner file this book in the magic realism genre.<br />I'm not sorry I read it and it has me asking questions about various mythologies. [...]
B000001FS3|5.0|To Whom It May Concern...<br />It has gone far too long!  This fantastic album sounds mediocre at best.  Please remaster (and possibly re-mix) this and all the other U2 albums.  Get on the bus with everyone else.  In this day and age, for fans to listen to such a muffled sounding cd is crazy.
B00003CWL5|1.0|This movie is a who dun it where you have to guess who killed the dad.  Now, i dint see American beauty because I dont like mystery.  I like movies where people ACT! and not just who did the killing.  My grandmother likes who dun its, though, so I know people out tehre like them, but I would rather wach a movie wioth James Dean or Marlyn Monroe.  Also, even though I dint see it i know from previews for it that it was the dark haied girl who killed him, I think she's his daughter?  See, I'm right and look at all the time and money i saved by not watching American Beauty!!!
B000085RTZ|5.0|The title says it all... this album is an amazing achievement, and I can't wait for part 2!  Khan's awesome vocals convey the power and emotion that so many vocalists are unable to reach, and he's backed up by an incredibly talented band.  Epica once again proves that Kamelot is the best in the business!
B00004RFFS|5.0|Interview With The Vampire, is the film adaptation of Rice's Novel, originally written in the mid '80s.  The film explores the psychological makeup of the vampire mind.  A creature once mortal turned vampire, lurking the streets in the night, only to feed on those who cross his path.  This movie shatters all stereotypes of the vampire.  This creature does not jump from behind bushes only to mutilate one's neck and ferociously bleed his victim dry.  This movie demonstrates the truth of the vampire, that like all creatures, including humans, they are emotional, thinkers, intellects, compassionate, lovers, and some even befriend mortals.  The vampire Louis, brilliantly portrayed by Brad Pitt, is the central character whose very actions depict a sudden transformation from human to immortal.  He must re-evaluate what he deems &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;good&quot; to put into perspective his new found life or death depending upon how you see vampire existence and is remarkably emotional as Rice describes Louis in her novel.  Kirsten Dunst is a extraordinary Claudia, a child vampire, who must also come to grips with her immortality as child having been made a vampire as a child, never to mature physically.  Tom Cruise, was a brilliant blond, blue-eyed, Lestat, he is the true spoiled brat prince, arrogant vampire as Rice intended him to be.  Louis (Pitt), reeks hatred against Lestat (Cruise) for not being able to explain the meaning of their existence as creatures of Dark.  This movie is brilliant, complex, intelligent, and destroys the vampire stereotypes.  The vampire, having once been mortal, is more human than us all, having lost the luxuries of walking the daylight.  A spell-binding journey for the mind.  The Vampire Lives.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|The laughs wear out quickly; it gets off to a good start with Stiller's preening/pouting model shtick but that same gag gets milked ruthlessly for the next ninety minutes. Jerry Stiller and Will Ferrell are good in supporting roles but it's far from their best stuff. People seem to compare this to &quot;Old School&quot; a lot but it's definitely not in that league, although it's okay for a goofy comedy. I'd give it two and-a-half stars if I could. A bad cameo by the totally useless Paris Hilton drags it down a half star at least.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a very unique film and the Japanese theme was outstanding! It was an overall great piece of work. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson did an incredible job! Not just any common person would like this, though. This is the type of movie you really have to think deep about, not just what they present on the surface on screen....
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|I will do have to give it merit, The lyrical work and instrumental tech is decent enough. But, I would have to say that is NOT METAL. No, metal is Iron Maiden, Dimmu Borgir, In Flames, Death, Pantera, hell, I'll toss in Tool in the same catagory. This band is near that level, but not IN that level. It is a cute attempt at gothenburg, but a horrible attempt at that. There is no brutality, no heart, no soul of death metal found here. <br />Honorable mention in the drum work in Chapter Four :00-:30 and the guitar solos. The lyrics needs to be polished though... The lyrics is ok throughout the album... but the delivery just sends it to the &quot;emo&quot; section for me. The screaming singer sharpens the edge of the lyrical content, but at times, even he fails to deliver. <br />Yet, This album is a step forward in the right direction though. I personally will watch on this artist to see if they can reach the unholy section known as Melodic Death Metal, or if they stand stagnant in a sugar coated blasphamy of the name. <br />If you are really into this type of music, and are looking for something with more teeth in it, try In Flames, new Arch Enemy, or even Shadows Fall. All are good candidates for progression of musical horizons.
B00000JCY0|4.0|HEARTBREAK TODAY, SET ME FREE, SWEET F.A, INTO THE NIGHT, REBEL ROUSER, OWN UP, TAKE A LOOK AT YOURSELF AND OF COARSE NO YOU DON'T. WHICH HAD A FEW MINOR FLAWS IN THE RECORDING. DROP OUT OF VOICE AND ONE MIX DID NOT SOUND ON ONE SIDE OF THE SPEAKER. THE LAST 1 MIN AND 15 SEC. WHERE IT STARTED. I HAVE A LOUD BUTTON ON MY RECIEVER. IF TURNED OFF. THE SOUND IS MUCH BETTER. THAN WITH IT ON. IM TALKING ABOUT THE NON-FLAWLESS SONGS THAT IS. THE REST OF THE SONGS DONT SUITE MY TASTE. MAYBE IN TIME THEY WILL.
0385336810|5.0|I loved this  book! Because I got this book from my friend who lives in the UK, the read it 2 weeks before it released here in the US. If you loved the Shopaholic series, I absolutely recommend this book for you! It is very funny and very much relatable! I enjoyed it very much and I can't wait for the movie to come out!
B0001611DI|4.0|The latest edition of George Romero's classic film Dawn of the Dead is a visual treat to the newly intiated, or the long time fan.  The transfer onto dvd for this nearly 30 year horror film is nothing short but incredible.  The resolution is crystal clear, and the sound is excellent.  The creepy soundtrack alone is enough to raise the hair on your arms let alone the grim visage on the screen as the story unfolds before you.<br />  The story is pretty simple, and Romeros camera work lets it unfold like a long lunch.  From the long pans of the gased up hunter picking off zombies as if they were empty beer cans to the panaramic shots of the deserted suburban shopping mall where the film takes place.  Our four survivors hold up in a pittsbugh shopping mall and slowly make the place their own in stylish late 70's chic.<br />  The characters while never really going overboard with background quickly become endearing to the viewer, and to this day still represent classic &quot;Movie Heroes&quot;.  Make-up artist Tom Savini makes a memorable cameo as a biker leading an army of malcontents intent on taking the mall away from our heroes.  Well one thing leads to another and before too long zombies are ripping bodies apart in graphic all to familiar form.  The special effects of the New Dawn don't seem to be as &quot;In Your Face Like A Hammer&quot; as the original, and even i was getting a little sqeamish during one particularly horrific scene involving a prone biker, and a pack of very hungry zombies.  The scene still dusturbs me even after all these years.<br />  The extras are nice but do seem a little sparse for such a cult classic, but its been nearly 30 years.  any &quot;lost&quot; footage or Bonus scenes are most likely nearly disintegrated with age.  The price is very nice for such classic, well put together Horror classic.<br />  I can solidly reccommend this for the not so faint at heart.  After watching this you'll never look at shopping malls the same again.ame again.
0393314804|4.0|It's a hard book to understand. The English is really bad, you don't know who's saying what, half of it is cursing and is basically a bunch of non related stories. So why is it so good? The dialogues. Renton is the typical smart guy disenchanted with life. We've all know him even if he didn't have this sincere and truthful junk habit. His rants are the best and most of them aren't even in the movie. By the way, the book has nothing to do with the movie. There are hundreds of characters that don't make it to the big screen (Rents brother, Second Prize, etc, etc.) Also, Tommy isn't such a clean guy in the book and Dianne is just a small character. In the end the message is the same: people do drugs because it's the only good time they have even if it destroys them. (...)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Although the lead single may be attempting to cash in on the publicity of \\"the kiss\\" with madonna the other tracks on this CD more than make up for the weakness of that particular song. toxic, the hit single, is fast paced, high energy and sexy: the three ingredients to a great pop song. the next single \\"everytime\\" is one of the more beautiful songs on this CD and one of the many songs written by Britney herself. other standouts include \\"showdown\\", the duet with the ying yang twins \\"(i got that) boom boom\\", the always sexy \\"breathe on me\\", \\"shadow\\". the australian edition has the typical me against the music remix as well as 2 bonus songs which are definatly worth checking out
B0000AOV85|4.0|Dark Side is the best album ever. However, knowing exactly what some of the songs are about takes away some of it's magic, which is why I gave the DVD 4 stars. On the other hand, it's great to see the band talk about it and what it meant to them. People describe the album as a complete experience and not just a collection of nice tunes, which is exactly what it is. This DVD is a must for any Floyd fan but it really doesn't make any sense if you've never heard Dark Side. Any Colour You Like is not mentioned but since it's a jam I supposed it's ok. It's amazing how it fits in the album though. One of the highlights of the DVD is listening to &quot;the voices&quot; and how they came about. Also, Gilmour playing Us and Them and Water's very last comment: &quot;... but that doesn't mean the potential for the sun to shine doesn't exist, walk the path down towards the light rather than into the darkness...&quot;
0792844882|2.0|I don't like this film and because of it, it gave me a different perspective of the original as an immature movie.<br />It's great for adults but anyone under 17 don't watch it i guarntee you that<br />I am 13 years old, so pretty please with a cherry on top, recommend my review PLEEEEEEEEEEASE or else!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The Matrix movie was a hit. The first time anyone used \\"bullet time\\" special effects.<br />The Matrix Reloaded was a box office hit but not quite good to me. Using the same effects, it has gotten better.<br />The Matrix Revolutions had fans a little disappointed. It was a good movie, but not quite the greatest show in the dreamworld and Zion. Of course, there are special effects. The story/movie is confusing at some points, but there are still things to like about The Matrix Revolutions. This may be good to rent or just borrow from someone else. You could buy it thinking it is inevitable. You can think about it saying the problem is choice. Or not to by saying Why? It's your choice. I give it a B- and 3.5 stars
B00004TH83|1.0|Fabian's fresh offering for her first English album is a replica of Celine Dion's previous work. If you like Celine Dion, you'd hate her. More so, if you dislike Celine Dion you'd hate her more! Totally no originality. I'll give Lara Fabian the ax on this! Grab &quot;Just Me&quot; from the best Australian Selling Female Artist instead, Tina Arena! She's helluva better than Lara!
B00008J4P5|5.0|Once I heard this album I couldn't stop listening. Fantastic!
B0000057C5|5.0|this is the best rammstine cd ever. i love it but i dont have it if u wanna sell it email me at coolkeith@critterpost.com.
B000059ZLH|4.0|...for the sound being a bit subpar and the video effects etc...a little immature I would be giving it a 5. But even with the sound the way it is I can still shake my house when it's cranked up and it sounds thunderous, but the master volume is too low. I get no high level output on my eq display, but it still sounds pretty nice. Both my kids like it...11/2yrs and 2mo.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Mildred pierce in his spirit the film together with The Pastoral Symphony of Jean Delanoy who better explores the female world in this decade so filled with trouble and fear.<br />The close experience of the Second World war in a certain way was a crossroad for a huge crowd of directors. 1945 is the birth of the italian neorealism, the full comittment of the film noir, the first aproximations of the social film (Remember Kazan , Wilder , Dmytrik , Losey, Wyler,) and I think it was the starting point of the sparkle for the new wave cinema ten years after.<br />If you watch this movie, you`ll forget you`re in the a a film from the forties. Because the story is told so perfectly and the matter in question is so related with everyone of us that all the explored universe of feelings , the proud, the anger and the constance of the main character in a ravishing performance of Mrs. Crawford and the astonishing Anne Blyth, makes that film not only a cult movie but a obligated reference for those who love the art of cinema.<br />If I coukd, I`d give it ten stars instaed of just five.
B00005U2JL|3.0|The sound quality wasn't nearly as good as the nine inch nails dvd, and the video as well.  that's my opinion.  if you're a manson fan, how could this dvd make you disapointed though, his shows are crazy.  I would have asked for more features though sinse it costed so much.
0786869143|4.0|The Luck Factor by Richard Wiseman is definitely one of the more interesting/entertaining books I have read in my lifetime. I am not much of an avid book reader, but I do know a good book when I read one. Throughout the book, the doctor details the data gathered from many people of various types who he studied  to discover just what exactly makes one person \\"luckier\\" than another. One thing he found was that persons who exert themselves socially create more contacts and more opportunities for &quot;lucky&quot; events. He spent eight years doing many elaborate tests and comparing the data from these tests. And with the results, he compiled this masterpiece book that everyone should read--especially the unlucky!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Any perfect circle fan will relize that this album is quite different than their first. The only songs that remind me of the fist album are &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; &quot;The outsider&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot; the rest seem to take on an original format that still is perfect circle sounding somehow. <br />This album is VERY dark and deals with issues such as death, suicide, drugs, lonliness ect... From being weak and powerless, speaking of nooses, being a stranger and a suicidal outsider, to counting bodies to a war drum, or simply vanishing, and watching someone turn blue (perhaps dieing?) This album seems to deal with some serious dark issues. But fear not, many dismiss this album because they claim its TOO dark. They cant handel the repeated death and lonliness images; however, this album must be listened to in ORDER. The last song gravity offers the only optimistic message on the album and it also the last song the listener is left with. You must keep in mind that the last words that are spoken are &quot;I choose to live&quot; totaly turning the rest of the album on its head. Pretty cool stuff
0671027387|5.0|You will learn some facts and fiction from this reading.  I couldn't put it down.  It was GREAT!!
0345440900|4.0|Why all the bad reviews?  I thought this book had so many good suggestions!  After reading all the negative reviews, I would swear I had read a different book, because they just don't make sense to me.  I did not find any condescending tone whatsoever...  I could picture a very pleasant British lady speaking to me as if we had been best friends for life.  And what's the deal with breastfeeding?  I didn't notice anything that made it seem like it's not the best thing for your baby.  As a matter of fact, she helped me to get the hang of it a little better.  Of course, there are some things in the book that I choose not to do as a mother, but that's true with ALL the reference books I read before having a baby.  That's the key. Don't ever use a book as a way of life!  Use it for what it's for...reference!  Take what you want from it and leave all the useless info aside.
076790592X|5.0|Of all the books I have read in my life this is the best one so far. It makes you live life to the fulliest and not be so caught up with the fear of death. Not only taught me about death but also all those things we fear about the most. For example, love, regrets, and marriage. These are just a few of the many things that Morrie teaches us through his inspiring words.It has really inspire me to live my life with no regrets. I just hope that I can be as strong as Morrie if I am placed that kind of situation that he was. I highly recommend this book to everyone that feels that their life is not worth much because this book will teach you not to take life for granted.
B000088E6D|2.0|Buble's take on swing is Frank Sinatra by way of Wayne Newton.  The voice is tremendous, but he can't seem to hold on to the intimacy; he starts out slow and low, but then the music takes on a hard-edged, brassy sound that never fails to remind me of Vegas, for some reason.  Too showy.
0345403959|4.0|I thought this thick book would be at worst repeating things already mentioned in the saga, as the style of Eddings is similar to fairytales rather than an attempt for a realistic feeling world, and the stereotypes (particularly describing the various peoples and cultures) he already created in books 1 to 5 were repeated enough as it is. I was right about that, he repeats some things but generally speaking 90 percent of this book is all new material, as the history from Belgarath's point of view.<br />I had a great deal of good laughs; the book has a slower pace and allows for greater detail at points, but Eddings spares us a lot of boredom and still manages to capture not only great events but also everyday life. Robert Jordan could learn a thing or two from Eddings even though he might have greater talent.
B00000294R|5.0|Big L, <BR>Is by far one of the most clever MC's ever grasp the mic. He resurrected Harlem in the early 90's. A time when Harlem had very few hip-hop artists, some of whom were ashamed of there own area. Big L and Kool Moe Dee are probably the greatest MC's ever to rise from the Harlem streets. What kills me about this, is how so many folks jumped on Big L's jock after he was brutally murdered. Let's face it, a large majority of these reviewers only became interested Big L overnite. Why do you think his posthumous album &quot;The Big Picture&quot; is certified gold? Why couldn't everyone see this raw talent when he was living? It's become a redundant trend in music to all of a sudden pay close attention to dope artists after they pass away. If you weren't down with the underground from the jump just stay out, and keep supporting that garbage you call hip hop. Quit trying to pay your respects to the soldiers you know nothing about. Some of these people in these reviews go on and on about how L was so great, but don't probably even own any of the other DITC family albums. God forbid if O.C. dies...I garauntee will see some more bandwagon dikridders up in here, talking about how great  he was, when they didn't know squat about the man when he was alive. Personally when L died that was my worst Valentine's Day ever in life. He was truly an inspiration that taught us that being underground in hip hop can still be simplistic as hell while using witty punchlines, instead of complex as hell... with deep metaphors. If you add Lifestylez to your collection, explore the entire D.I.T.C. catalog as well, peep the classic albums from Lord Finesse, Show &amp; AG, O.C., Diamond D, and Fat Joe. Don't be a freakin tourist....support real underground hip hop. Quit coming around after somebody passes. The reason why hip hop is so screwed up right now is simply because it lacks the balance of underground and mainstream...when you have an equilibrium it provides the audience with more creative outlets and alternatives. But if the balance is gone and its shifted too far to the mainstream or too far towards the underground, you have a world of mimicry, lack of inspiration, and no creativity. Think about that....That's why hip hop was at its peak during the Golden Era -1987-1994.<BR>Big L RIP.
0440178002|5.0|And still it's well worth 5 stars. the first two thirds of this book is quite simply the richest and funniest story I have ever read. Clavell combines elements of power politics, culture clash, intrigue and romance in such a powerful way, just when a few pages of one aspect leaves you breathless the other grips you. There aren't many dull moments in this largish book. <br />The book might have it's faults as far as language and detail goes, but it's the most entertaining fiction I ever read. Unfortunately there comes a point in the story where more effort goes into bulding the climax, and a truly woeful event takes place which will likely lessen the interest of many readers; the last third of it is is drifting along both for the main character and the readers, and while a climax is built properly, in fact there is no proper climax, or it can be read from history books but not this one.<br />Which is not an entirely bad thing because this book serves as a great introduction to late medieval Japan, more in the sense of arousing interest toward the culture and history rather than being that educational, or necessarily even accurate at points. For anyone who doesn't want to educate themselves about history and exotic cultures, beware - after reading this, the next three books you'll read will be exactly that.
B0000931OG|4.0|they have really grown up since parklife, and although the depature of g. coxon is unfortunate, they can still make challenging, thoughtful music.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|What a pointless movie. I cannot believe they gave an Oscar to this snoozer. I agree with the reviewer that the clout of the Coppola name is the only thing that got this monotonous movie made (much less honored with an Oscar).<br />There are a couple of times when I felt hopeful the story (such as it is) might actually take off, like the amusing exchange between the Japanese commercial director and Murray. But too quickly the scene passed, and the viewer is left watching the protagonists lying around their hotel rooms, doing nothing but stare out windows and up to ceilings.<br />If the two main characters think they are bored in Japan, they should try watching this movie.
0385510438|2.0|I am so glad I am done with this book. I have never not finished something I've started, but was darn close with this. Boring. If I wanted to read about segregation in the south I would have chosen a non-fiction book.I was excpecting an exciting, fast paced, &quot;whodunnit&quot; thriller. Boring. The charachters are absolutely forgetfull. I really enjoy reading and developing a &quot;relationship&quot; with well drawn charachters. None hear. So much more could have been done with the offing of the jurors. Just bang,bang their dead? How bout some detail!? Boring. This was the first Grisham novel I have read, and frankly, I was extremely dissapointed.
B000006YYM|4.0|Although I don't like it quite as much as its predecessor, &quot;In a Glass House,&quot; or the album that follows, &quot;Free Hand,&quot; don't let some of the other reviewers mislead you, this is a definite step toward the less complex, more commercial sound that would find its peak in the Giant's next release, &quot;Free Hand.&quot; The album is still original and challenging, but some songs, especially &quot;Aspirations&quot; and &quot;Playing the Game&quot; can be grasped after two or three listenings, something that can't always be said about this great band's music. (If you want dissonance, I won't argue &quot;Interview&quot; is the album for you).<br />Derek Shulman once said in an interview that this album lacked some of the energy of their other work. That may be true in the case of some cuts--&quot;Valedictory&quot; strikes me as a particularly unsatisfying re-hash of &quot;Proclimation,&quot; but there's plenty of energy in cuts like &quot;Cogs in Cogs&quot; and &quot;Proclamation&quot; and some of the quiter songs, including the aforementioned &quot;Aspirations&quot; and the underrated &quot;No God's a Man,&quot; stand up to anything they've done. This may not be my favorite GG album, but along with &quot;Octopus,&quot; &quot;Glass House&quot; and &quot;Free Hand&quot; it does form the core of their best work, falling just a notch below those three others.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|I highly recommend buying this! It's a must for a Mac fan! 41 songs! 20 of them being the original album and 21 being extra material! It's definately worth every penny!  Some of my favorites from this album are &quot;Over and Over&quot;, &quot;The Ledge&quot;, &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;Storms&quot;, &quot;I Know I'm Not Wrong&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Child&quot;, and &quot;Tusk&quot;! The extra songs are great! I especially like the awesome version of &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;Stroms&quot;, and &quot;Kiss and Run&quot;!
B000002JSR|1.0|I can't be more honest about how I feel toward this album except to say that it sucks. I tried to rate it with no stars but the site will not let me so I must give it one (which it doesn't deserve). I live in a town (Las Vegas) where the &quot;classic&quot; rock radio stations seems to think that there were only four classic rock bands that ever existed and each of those bands only recorded four songs each. Well, this is one of those bands.<br />To be fair, I actually used to like the Zep for their first three albums, but I started losing it for them when the fourth started getting overplayed. I still did not hate them when I wasted a few bucks on this gem either. Like has been said before at this site, this is a collection of outtakes and stuff and it shows. I listened to this mess one time and it left a bad taste in my mouth, as in &quot;ripoff.&quot; What can I say? It sucks, plain and simple.<br />Moving to Las Vegas is what really tipped the scale for me with this band. Our great radio stations play Zep to death, to the point where I am wearing out the off button on my radio! Thank goodness I have a CD player in my truck! To make things worse, I have to put up with that Cadillac TV commercial with the &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; music playing in the background.<br />Just to remind myself and give it another chance, I listened to the samples here on Amazon and had to cringe. They still suck. Sorry for all you Led Zeppelin fans, but if you must buy their music, I suggest leaving this one alone unless someone gives it to you or pays you to take it! By the way, did I already say this album sucks?
B000002UAI|5.0|This album is overlooked...........great originals....a few covers....and a little cream in your jeans
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas, I think is New York's top emcee, jay-z thinks he's gonna go out on top and retiring with the Black album, but with nas coming out with two cd's in summer he'll prove him wrong.  Every track on illmatic is a gem, his rhymes and flow are incredible.  He has alot of talent and he'll never make such a great album as this one.  Most definetly one of the best hip-hop records made.
B000002UDB|5.0|Alright....do yourself a favor and see the movie.......Filled with good tunes, a midget photographer that wheres a bear mask, random dialogue and John Lennon shoveling spaghetti onto a fat woman's plate......need I say more?
B00018D44U|4.0|Overall, a very enjoyable album and a worthy sophomore effort from Norah Jones.  Most tracks feel comfortable and familiar.  That's not criticism, but I get the impression that she knows where her strengths are.  The one 'outside the box' track is the rather bizarre duet with Dolly Parton.  That one should have been left 'outside the CD' as far as I'm concerned.  But for that track, I would have given the album 5 stars.
0316666343|5.0|`The Lovely Bones' works as an odd yet affecting coming-of-age story. Susie struggles to accept her death while still clinging to the lost world of the living, following her family's dramas over the years. Her family disintegrates in their grief: her father becomes determined to find her killer, her mother withdraws, her little brother Buckley attempts to make sense of the new hole in his family and her younger sister Lindsey moves through the milestone events of her teenage and young adult years with Susie riding spiritual shotgun. Random acts and missed opportunities run throughout the book - Susie recalls her sole kiss with a boy on earth as &quot;like an accident - a beautiful gasoline rainbow&quot;. <BR>Sebold has managed to lighten the gruesome, gritty subject matter in an uplifting way with a lively read, which is often very funny at times; bringing tears of joy as well as sadness; and helping the reader to step back a little, (just like fourteen year old Susie in her heaven), as the tragic, traumatic events unfold in front of us. We struggle with Susie as she struggles. We watch with her as she watches those she loves. She has been snatched from earth, cruelly raped and murdered by the seemingly normal neighbour. Her family are torn asunder in their own private ways following her untimely death. We watch with Susie as she watches her first love Ray, wishing she could kiss him again. <BR>The descriptions of the love and friendship between a parent and child are beautifully constructed and painfully moving. It describes the kind of love that is so strong it almost aches. This is a book that will not fail to touch people on so many levels, those dealing with grief, loss and guilt. A book that is all at once harrowing and stunning, keeping you on a knife-edge throughout. <BR>Its beauty lies in its simplicity; a love story tainted by grief but surmounted by humanity with an ethereal presence. <BR>Sebold offers a comforting picture for anyone that has ever lost someone close, where they are at peace and watch over those they have left behind until they are ready to let go.<BR>Although a fictional piece of work, this was story that had to be told. It speaks volumes and will linger hauntingly with you long after the final page is turned. Susie Salmon deserves to emerge as one of literature's true classic characters as her story has tackled the realistic, chilling horrors of child rape and murder and the loss of a child in a world where this occurs on an hourly basis. Her ordeal is told in such a terrifying yet tender way that it will render you speechless in places, reduce you to tears and chill you to the bone. This is one of the most powerful, thought-provoking and disturbingly beautiful books I have ever read.
B00009ATIX|2.0|&quot;Solaris&quot; is a conceptually idealistic love story couched in a Science Fiction film that is highly reminiscent of Sc-Fi films and novels in the fifties and sixties.  That being said, it does accomplish that to a certain degree but the overall outcome of the film is a less than spectacular film that leaves one looking at their watch as the DVD plays on.<br />One of the most surprising aspects of this film is that one of its primary producers is James Cameron himself.  Typically, if his name is stamped on a project it is destined for success but that unfortunately doesn't happen here.  Perhaps had he taken the director's chair for this film it might've been a touch better.<br />Performance wise, all of the actors involved did a good job with their respective roles, the script not withstanding.  To date, I would have to say that George Clooney's departure from the small screen to big screen has been a more or less lesson in hit and miss, with this film scoring as a miss.<br />Director Steve Soderbergh, best known for films such as &quot;Erin Brokovich&quot; and &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; more or less stepped outside of his comfort zone with this film and the seeming end result of his traveling in the Science Fiction lane leaves one to the conclusion that he probably won't travel in it again.<br />The Premise:<br />George Clooney plays Chris Kelvin who is a company psychologist sent to a space station orbiting an extremely mysterious planet.  He's sent there after the crew stops responding to hails from the company and one of those crew members sends a message specifically asking for him.  Upon his arrival he finds that some of the crew is dead and he too starts experiencing the same problems that everyone else had.  A few years prior, his wife had died and now, in the middle of his first night on the station she shows up in his room with him...<br />What follows from there is a story that is quite different in and of its self where the primary characters aretrying to cope with these mysterious characters from their pasts showing up.<br />Overall, I'd recommend this film primarily as a rental to most movie watchers.  Of no doubt is that there are some out there who would find an appreciation for this films approach unfortunately, I'm not one of them.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Full length audio commentary by Director Steven Soderbergh and Producer James Cameron<BR>-HBO &quot;Making Of&quot; Special<BR>-&quot;Solaris:  Behind the Planet&quot; Featurette<BR>-Original Screenplay<BR>-Theatrical Teaser and Trailer
0385335482|5.0|For any woman who loves to shop and spends hours pouring through fashion mags longing to own the best of the best-you must read all about the adventures of Rebecca Bloomwood.  I felt like I was reading about myself.  Rebecca can rationalize any purchase she makes.  She finds a way to convince herself that she &quot;needs&quot; the latest sweater or make-up.  If you love fashion and love to shop-THIS IS A MUST READ!!!  Absolutely hillarious!  I laughed out loud several times while reading.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I love this concert film since I first saw it when I was fifteen years old (that is in 1983). I was in love with this group from the time I saw the film. They have been my favorite band and David is fantastic. This is a must for anyone who likes the TH's. I can not wait to get my copy!!

B0000TLA9G|5.0|I have been waiting for this album FOREVER.  Without it I be forced to buy all of their CDs just to get the songs I want from Guns N Roses. (Of course I bought them all on tape originally.)  I am thrilled to see all the songs I love on one CD.  Guns N Roses songs have stood the test of time.  I love them for their nostagia value, but they're also just really good songs.
0385336810|5.0|People that liked the Shopaholic books, should love this book... as for me - I thought this book was even better...  altogether funnier!<br />The character of Emma (she was a bit flaky) was very likable. I am sure that everyone can find some aspect of Emma's life that they can identify with (not getting the promotion they wanted, not being the favorite child, etc).  She was a very REAL person.<br />The way the book is written makes you laugh out loud as Emma finds herself in one predicament after another. <br />I won't kid anyone - this book has no deep plot, no twists (you can figure out how its going to end from the beginning)... but its great fun!
B000002AS3|5.0|I can't understand why people like (WTS)MG? better. DM's got everything. It's simply amazing. <br />The best songs, IMO, are Rock 'n' Roll Star, Live Forever, Supersonic, Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol (so f***ing good) and Slide Away. They get 11 out of 10. The others 10 out of 10. <br />If you're new to Oasis. Buy this album first. I promise that you won't be disappointed. Not if you appreciate good music.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|After reading a good portion of the reviews for this movie, it becomes clear that folks that like it feel so much superior to those that didn't. Any film with artistic aspirations seems to have a built-in ace in the hole: if you didn't like it, you didn't get it. Clearly, if you gave it less than 5 stars, it was over your head. According to the films' many ardent fans, those of us that didn't care for it must obviously fall into that vast, amorphous population so ruined by coarse American culture that a subtle and delicate piece of art like this is lost on us. Christ, Americans are so pedestrian in their tastes. It's rather embarrassing to be one, isn't it?<br />I might add here that this little film did very well in America, did nicely on Oscar night, and the DVD sales aren't doing too badly either. So to say that this film can't be appreciated by the blunt, obvious taste of America is incorrect. I might also respond to those reviewers critical of American film making by saying that most of the great European directors, particularly the French New Wave, learned their craft by worshiping at the feet of the great American masters of the thirties and forties. Still, this film didn't do as well as, say, Bad Boys II. But then there is a good reason for that.<br />I remember reading that Francois Truffaunt was a huge fan of American gangster films, and in fact remarked more than once he considered them the only kind of film that interested him. How could this be? How could the director of such a  tender character study as Jules and Jim get off on James Cagney and George Raft (who were the big-budget &quot;action&quot; stars of their day)? The answer is simple: in an action film (yes, like Rambo, which was a very good film, by the way), the situations are heightened to an unusual level, thus characters in the film are themselves heightened and brought into sharp focus. Action films, in the most dramatic of terms, always have a very powerful conflict that needs resolution. What characters do under the extreme pressure, in action, is very interesting. Thus the experience of watching a good action film can be a very intense experience. You folks that turn up your noses at Rambo are missing plenty of great cinema.<br />What the zealous fans of this film don't get is this: it is very possible to dislike this film while at the same time &quot;getting&quot; every bloody, boring second of it. I mean, c'mon, somebody make me fall down laughing and call this film &quot;deep.&quot; Lost in Translation was a dull, pretensious, childishly obvious piece of filmmaking. It was a long student film about (what a surprise) alienation. Oooh, I bet Sofia Coppola feels alienated herself, much like the young female lead she posed in endless &quot;lonely girl&quot; shots, don't you think? It was not a terrible movie; just immature. It didn't have what a great film like Die Hard had: a great conflict involving great characters. Bill Murray saved the day by adding his talents, which made it worth a rental. The last scene, which was the only gripping scene in the film, was very moving. It just took way too much celluloid to get there.<br />By the way, all you European lovers should go to Europe sometime, or anywhere in the world, for that matter. You know what they are watching? The current blockbusters from Hollywood. You know why? Because Hollywood learned long ago how to make a great movie that keeps butts in the seats. That's why. -Mykal Bantan.

B0001DI0FI|4.0|The negative reviews for \\"Master and Commander\\" that I've read sound like they were written by those of the MTV generation, or younger still.  Anyone who is just looking for action, graphic violence and nudity will be sadly disappointed in this movie.  Believe it or not, this movie actually has a Plot.  I know many of you remember the days when movies still had a good plot at their core, but they have become very few and far between these days.  Once in a while we get some great movies, like The English Patient, Dances with Wolves, or Schindler's List.  \\"Master and Commander\\" ranks among those few films worthy of the term \\"masterpiece\\".
B00005JMNA|5.0|Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I have seen it 2x in the last 3 days. Diego Luna is a great actor besides the fact that he is very hot! He's my new fav actor. Romola Garai did a good job on this film.  Their chemistry on screen is great and I am surprised that neither of them had any previous dancing experience and had to learn all of it. They did a great job! There are a couple lines that disrupted the intimate scenes, but overall it was a fantastic movie! Go see it if you haven't already but make sure you don't have expectations. It is nothing like the original. It's my new fav movie and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!
0142000663|5.0|Set in the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma, and on the long road to California, the promised land in the time of The Great Depression.  The Joad family is one of many families, sharecropers, thrown off thier land when the crops fail and who must become migrant workers.  There is the promise of jobs in California, so to California they must go.  Piling thier trucks and cars high with what few possessions they have not sold, and heading out on the road.<br />This is more than the story of a single family though, much more.  This is the story of hundreds of thousands of families, homeless and wandering and starving while trying to maintain a shred of dignity and humanity.  They must endure the cruelties of the road, the police, the foremen of the farms who will work entire families all day for only enough money for a single meal's worth of food at the company store.<br />Though this book's length is rather daunting, I found myself so caught up in the struggle of the Joads that I read through in a short time.  Through the story of the Joads, the story of the migrant workers of that era is well portraied; the struggle of many in the migration, the search for work, the pain of death, the dispair of watching the children go hungry and feeling helpless to stop it.
B000002JPA|5.0|As an avid rock music fan, I love all styles of the genre, from punk to metal, from ska to thrash, from classic rock to 80's metal, and even a little bit of easy listening thrown into the mix.  After hearing so much about Dream Theater from friends and prog aficionados alike, good and bad, I decided to give the band a whirl, and purchased Images And Words, as recommended from the DT fans I've talked to.  To be honest, I wasn't easily impressed by the music, overall, although the technical musicianship was as good, if not better, as advertised.  Mike Portnoy is nothing but automatic on the drums, pummeling on the drums like a madman seemingly without exerting much effort.  John Petrucci is a magnificent soloist and John Myung is simply a virtuous on bass. However, my first impression of the album was that 1) James Labrie couldn't sing if his life depended on it, 2) the musical precision is so abundant that you would just be plain exhausted, 3) and of course, the keyboards can be annoying, especially if you're used to the raw energy of thrash and heavy metal.  But, Dream Theater is the type of band you really have to have an open mind about because they just delightfully grow on you and before you know it, you're hooked.  Images and Words is a refreshing break from today's nu-metal drivel and from the overwhelming, at times, exhausting thrash and death metal scene.  Here's a track-by-track rundown:<br />1) Pull Me Under: A steady, heavy, 8-minute rocker, which displays some flashes of thrash/speed metal.  It's not hard to fall in love with this song if you're accustomed to the thrash of the 80's and or early 90's metal.  Very catchy song with Portnoy's drum work and Moore's haunting keyboard rhythms carrying it while Petrucci and Myung tear it up on guitar and bass every now and then. 5/5.<br />2) Another Day: A metal ballad that you could imagine being played on your local soft rock/easy listening radio station.  The most discriminating of metal fans (especially fromthe harder and heavier variants of metal) might dismiss it as some cheesy pop track with a few sax and piano solos thrown in.  It's a beautiful, soothing track overall but past the two-minute mark, the song takes an uplifting, majestic, almost airy turn, reminiscent of 80's hair metal.  Look out for an awesome, climactic guitar solo. Labrie's vocals really match this type of song. 5/5.<br />3) Take The Time: Excellent intro, bringing in each instrument slowly and breaks out into a fast, heavy wall of drum, guitar, and keyboard.  This track takes on an array of tempo changes and Labrie's voice complies with this, although his first couple of verses are somewhat awkward since he takes on a Michael Jackson tone and pace in his vocal.  However, Labrie makes up for it, showing phenomenal range, almost reminiscent of the likes of Axl Rose, Freddy Mercury, and Bruce Dickinson. 5/5.<br />4) Surrounded: Starts off all soft and poppy, but quickly turns into an uplifting rocker. 4/5.<br />5) Metropolis Pt. 1: The most overwhelming track on the CD especially if you're giving it your first listen.  Very sophisticated solos and instrumental interplay at the climactic stanza of this almost 10 minute track. 4.5/5.<br />6) Under A Glass Moon: My personal favorite song here which just goes to show you how heavy and melodic DT can get.  Kevin Moore is absolutely stellar on keyboards here.  Labrie's vocals just soar on this track, showing some shades of Bruce Dickinson.  Poetic lyrics and an easily memorable chorus.  All elements mix flawlessly on this track; it's just poetry in motion. 5/5.<br />7) Wait For Sleep: A short (2:31) piano pop track, nothing real special. 2.5/5.<br />8) Learning To Live: Superb way to close out a masterful prog metal album.  Learning To Live is an 11-plus minute song which combines the heaviness of tracks like Under A Glass Moon with the melodies of tracks like Surrounded. 5/5.<br />Summing up, Images And Words is a must-have for any rock music fan.  I recommend becoming more acquainted with 80's metal bands and NWOBHM bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest or some other progressive bands before delving into this.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|its hard to say how i felt about wmxx. there was a lot of hype, as there is with every wm. i, personally, as a fan of wrestling, loved this event because of eddie and benoit reigning supreme. it was good to see \\"true\\" champions at wrestlemania. i am glad hhh had enough [courage] to drop the belt at the biggest event. nothing taken away from hhh, as he is a great mat wrestler, but if you want to \\"start again\\" is there a better way than having two of the absolute BEST in the business win (or retain) the titles? these two have deserved it for A LONG TIME, and seeing them embrace in the ring afterwards is reason enough to buy the dvd. there were some other highlights of the night, as well as some major disappointments. i mean c'mon, undertaker... a dead cowboy? he should just come out as mark callahan (ala mick foley) and end his career on a high note. i was in tears as he entered, one because he came back, two because i was so upset. other than that wmxx didnt live up to expectations. it was good, but if you want to start again, start here.
0679428895|4.0|I have heard so many good comments about this book, that I decided I had to read it, even though I feared that it may be a little bit boring by giving too many details on the Roman aqueducts. What I found instead was a highly entertaining story, which merges historical facts with fiction in a well thought out way. It is clear that the author went through great trouble to research the topics: aqueducts, volcanoes, Roman civilization, etc; and he presents the information proficiently and without losing the reader in the myriad of facts. Some of the findings exposed are incredible; for example, in the first century AD the Roman Aqueducts supplied Rome with more water than New York received in 1985!<br />The story starts two days before the eruption of the Vesuvius and focuses on Attilius and Ampliatus. Attilius is an engineer in charge of the Aqua Augusta, an aqueduct in the south of the Campania, which provides the cities of Pompeii, Nola, Neapolis, Puteolis, Cumae, Baiae and Misenum with their water supply. Attilius comes from a long line of engineers, notable for their work with the aqueducts. Ampliatus is a liberated slave who has become extremely wealthy after taking advantage of the destruction of Pompeii by an earthquake seventeen years ago.<br />At the beginning of the book we find Attilius looking for additional sources of water due to the drought that is affecting the Aqua Augusta. In one of his errands he is interrupted by a young lady, Corelia, asking him for help because her father is punishing a slave that was in charge of feeding his red mullets. Corelia's father is Ampliatus, and upon arrival Attilius discovers that the fish were killed because the water from the aqueduct is contaminated with sulfur. At this point the aqueduct's engineer embarks in a journey to Pompeii, where the suspected failure is located, to find the source of the problem and fix it.<br />Even though the action is not fast-paced through most of the book in terms of the writing, Harris makes the plot so interesting that the reader is drawn to the story as a scrap of metal to a magnet. There is a very impressive presentation of the aqueducts of Rome as well as of the main traits of the civilization, its politics and the interaction between the different social strata. As most stories dealing with the Roman Empire, this one does not lack in conspiracies and betrayal. It is impressive that the book has such a high level of suspense and tension considering that the reader knows what is going to happen in terms of the eruption of the Vesuvius. This is the first Robert Harris's book I read, but it definitely woke an interest in me to read his previous works.rris makes the plot so interesting that the reader is drawn to the story as a scrap of metal to a magnet.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|Not many bands can say they had this many Top 40 singles:<br />Gun n' Roses                Billboard<br />Sweet Child O' Mine - 1988    1<BR>November Rain - 1992            3<BR>Patience - 1989                    4<BR>Paradise City - 1989            5<BR>Welcome to the Jungle - 1988    7<BR>Don't Cry - 1991            10<BR>You Could Be Mine - 1991    29<BR>Live and Let Die - 1991            33<br />Plus the fact that Knockn on Heavens Door and Civil War are also great songs that they never allowed to compete for Top 40. They surely would of made it if they were released too.<br />The only bad about this is it is missing Brownstone, Nighttrain, Rocket Queen, and Estranged. But we now know it was not Axl or the bands fault. Record company's are terrible!<br />Awesome to see the Gunners already topping the charts with this (released March 15th) in Europe.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I managed to watch about 9/10 of the movie before I had to turn it off because I was so bored. I kept hoping that it would get better, but it didn't. There wasn't even really a plot line!
B00000ICN5|5.0|In 1983 Stevie Ray Vaughan came upon the blues scene with his debut album Texas Flood. If you can remember the 1980's was filled with hair bands. Then their was Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble. The first time I heard Texas Flood I thought to myself this is the next Jimi Hendrix. Stevie Ray Vaughan was a powerful blues guiarist, as well as a powerful voice. My favorite song on this album was always Texas Flood this was one of the greatest blues songs ever written. Before Texas Flood the band played the Montreux Jazz Festival one of their biggest downfalls. In the roaring crowd was David Bowie who discovered the young texan guitarist. Latter the great John Hammond would sign the band to Epic. Texas Flood was basically recorded live no special arangments just straight ahead blues played live just like the band did in the early Austin Clubs. The band Double Trouble were already Legends in a sense with a sucessful album in hand. Stevie Ray Vaughan was to me the guitar hurricane expesically on Texas Flood. <br />Pride And Joy, Texas Flood, Rude Mood, Mary Had Alittle Lamb, Dirty Pool, and Lenny were songs that Stevie reguarly played on stage during 1983 to 1990. I think for most guitarist Texas Flood is the best blues album that was ever created. Steive Ray Vaughan was a huge influence to many guitarist also. On this album their are also 5 bonus tracks. Starting out with SRV Speaks when Stevie talks about his guitar playing then, Tin Pan ALley, Testify(Live), Mary Had Alittle Lamb(Live), and Wham!(Live). Stevie remains as one of the greatest guitarist of all time he is truely the guitar hurricane. Highly Recomended!!

B0001JXQEM|5.0|As we all know, the blue album is one of the greatest CDs ever, but to combine it with another CD with excellent B-sides is just too cool!!  The rarities used on the second disc are excellent songs, and its cool to see how this magical little group called Weezer evolved.  Buy this if you want the greatest CD ever and enjoy the B-sides (hopefully you become an avid fan in no time).  Check out their DVD as well, out the same day as this, with all their stellar and groundbreaking videos!!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I don't know what all the negativity is about.  Yeah, Axl, Slash and Duff didn't want it out.  Yeah, \\"Entangled\\" is missing.  Yeah, there's nothing new here.  So what??  Think about what is.  All the big hits off APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION, G N'R LIES, USE YOUR ILLUSION I & II and THE SPAGHETTI INCIDENT?  Besides, anyone who is interested in this CD will already have the other albums (let's be honest), so if \\"Entangled\\" isn't here, guess what?  You already have it.  With the CD clocking in at 79 min, there was very little else Geffen could do.  The basic facts are that this album isn't \\"THE BEST OF...\\", but the GREATEST HITS and the two don't necessarily mean the same thing.  This was compiled with the Brits in mind too - remember that.  Every song here was a British Top 10 hit, yes, even \\"Ain't It Fun\\" and \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\".  This is a band that hasn't delivered an album in OVER TEN YEARS.  Naturally Geffen are obliged to put together a CD of songs that will SELL - and those are the hits.  For what it's worth, the sound is great and getting all these songs in one place is really convenient.  Bottom line: it's Guns N' F' Roses.  There's no way every song we like could be on here, otherwise it'd be a 3 CD set.  Just chill out, put it on and let GNR take you down to \\"Paradise City\\" again.
B00005JN1L|5.0|Johnny Depp should be recognized this film. His performance really deserves an Oscar. Johnny Depp character is an author who is accused of stealing a story from John Turturro's character. Johnny Depp then says he has proof that he created the story first. John Turturro character gives Johnny Depps character 3 days to give him proof that he made up the story first or else he'll kill him if he doesn't make the changes of the story, the original ending John Turturro character made. John Turturro character mess's with his head by killing his dog and just plain messing with him. Johnny Depp caught his wife cheating on him 6 months earlier. So he is going through a divorce, her new boyfriend then threatens to kick Johnny's ass if he doesn't sign the divorce papers for the divorce can be final. Johnny then hires a cop to look over his house and check if no one is in there, and to just protect him. It is a war between Depp and Turturro of who's the better author, even if you don't really like this film, I know your going to love Depps performance. It is a really shocking thriller, which will leave you on the edge of your seat.  <br />This movie is based on the novel by Stephen King, and you know all the movies based on Stephan Kings novels are amazing, like Pet Cementary, Misery, It, The Shining, Carry and other movies based on Stephen King. And you know the movies based on his novels are sure to be shocking thrillers! This is one of those movies where you have to watch it again and again to actually get it. These performances are really great.  John Turturro plays his character so well, he can actually just creep you out like if his character was real. This film has really great cinematography. The movie is really confusing at first, that's really the reason you need to watch it again and again. It will keep you guessing from end to beginning. This movie can make you jump out of your seat, when you walk out of the theater you will just be blown away out of the movie. Thisis truly, a must see.

B00000JLWW|4.0|Of course you're going to achieve big box office bucks when you put Leonardo DiCaprio in a movie! He is of course one of Hollywood's biggest heartthrobs, and at his peak, ANY girl would go see ANYTHING he made even the littlest appearance in.  That is obviously the reason the creators of the movie picked DiCaprio for the role, so billions of girls went, enjoyed the love story, but hated it when the boat sank.  This movie did a pretty good attempt at making a historical event enjoyable for young viewers, and it was a creative idea for simple minds.

B0001IN0DA|4.0|Wrestlemania XX was titled \\"WHERE IT ALL BEGINS...AGAIN\\". The WWE did it all over again. Sure some of the matches were great but most were let downs. Sure there was some funny and exciting moments, but the negatiives are way more noticable than the positives.<br />The Big Show vs John Cena(U.S. Title)- Good opening match, and it was cool to see Cena pick up a major title victory.  3.5/5<br />RVD & Booker T vs. La Resistance vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Gindrak vs. The Dudley Boyz(World Tag Team Titles)-Could of been a lot better but it was a decent match with some high spots. 3/5<br />Christian vs. Chris Jericho- Great match. One of the best of the night. Great ending that you must see! 4/5<br />Evolution vs. Rock n' Sock- Good Tag Team match. Better than what I was expecting. One of the highs of this event with great wrestling, filled with funny moments and a great ending. 4/5<br />Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Miss Jackie & Stacy(Playboy Evening Gound Match)-Not a good match at all. It just wasted time and built suspense and wait for the coming matches. 1/5<br />Cruiserweight Battle Royal- An ok match. There was not that many high spots and a very prdictable match. 2/5<br />Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar w/Stone Cold as ref- worst match that I have seen in a long time. This match was only saved by Stone Cold at the ending but not even Stone Cold could make this match a good one. 0.5/5<br />Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi vs the Basham Brothers, APA, and the Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Team Championship)- Another 4-way tag match. Not much to say about it when you already saw the exact same match earlier in the night. 2.5/5<br />Victoria vs. Molly Holly(Womens Championship)- Short match and not that much entertaining. Even after the match when Molly had to shave her head it still was not that entertaining. 1.5/5<br />Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero(WWE Title)-The WWE finally had a Wrestlemania type match. This was a great match filled with many high spots and exciting action. The ending is very unpredictable. 4.5/5<br />The Undertaker vs.Kane-In my opinion the most anticipated moment of the night. The Undertaker's return. It was awesome with the druids and Paul Bearer. Then when he came out it was a let down. He is still the American Badass with the same attire just different music. The match was short and should of been longer but it was still one of my favorite moments of the night.4/5<br />Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs.Chris Benoit(World Title)-Best match of the night. Blood,sweat, and tears were involved in this match. This was well woth the wait. One of the best Triple-Threat matches of all time. 5/5<br />Overall the WWE had a chance to hit a Grand Slam, but they didn't. They had numerous oppurtunities to make this event the best of all time, but they did not.<br />Good-Undertaker and Paul Bearer's Return<BR>Trish's heel turn<BR>Benoit wins the title<BR>Lesnar and Goldberg Get Stunned for there lackluster performance<BR>The New York Crowd was awesome and spoke there minds (i.e. The Lesnar vs. Goldberg Match)<br />Bad-Lesnar vs.Goldberg<BR>Lackluster tag team title matches<BR>Cruiserweight Battle Royal<BR>Playboy Evening Gound Match<BR>Kane vs. The Undertaker was too short<br />Final Rating 3/5<BR>I recomend Wrestlemania XIV,X-Seven, and XIX if you want the best that the WWE has to offer.
0385510438|5.0|I just finished reading The Last Juror and all I can say is it is probably one of the best books I've read this year. The story is simple yet complex, and the characters are beautifully drawn out. If only I could write like Grisham, I too would be a bestselling author (although I'm told THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY is going to be one). If I could write like JOhn Grisham, I'd be reading all the time instead of writing.
B00003CXTG|3.0|This movie attempted at satisfying both sexes with both war and love.  Unfortunately, this was unsuccessful because there wasn't enough war and gore to keep males interested, leaving the only audience to be sappy females who didn't want the war scenes at all.  I find myself fast forwarding through all the parts that don't pertain enough to the love story aspect of the movie.

6305897786|5.0|This is a psychologically disturbing film. In the Ninth Gate, Johnny Depp stars as a rare book finder/ investigator who is hired by Frank Langella (in one of his finest acting roles) to find a book which is supposed to open up the ninth gate, which is the gate to hell. There are only three copies of this book and everytime one shows up someone dies a strange death. A beautiful yet strange girl keeps following Johnny and seems to be protecting him yet also inticing or inviting him deeper into the unknown. In one of the best scenes in the film Johnny makes love  with her as a raging fire roars nearby. She appears to be the guardian or gatekeeper to hell or the devil incarnate. At the end, we see Johnny walking towards the gateway or doors to hell. My only complaint with the film is the music, its dull and boring but Johnny gives a great performance to make up for it. The Ninth Gate is a film worth seeing, if you like dark  and disturbing films.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Like millions of other fans of Bill Murray, I looked forward to his latest work, a rare dramatic performance.  However, despite the widespread acclaim from the press, I felt that &quot;Lost&quot; was given too much credit.  Frankly, this was not a great movie.  The acting (even with Murray) was sub-par.  The plot was weak and not believable as well as boring.  I expected to be an emotional piece of cinema.  Unfortunately, I sat through the entire film looking at my watch in anticipation of the conclusion.  My advice, rent first.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Some of the Best Tupac A.K.A. 2pac soon to be known as Makaveli I've heard. Soon, Makaveli will return and fulfill the prophecy. Yeah I know I sound crazy but I'm one of the 83% of Tupac a.k.a. 2pac Fans that belive he will be &quot;reborn&quot; as Makaveli. One reason I BELIVE Makaveli(Tupac) is alive is that The video &quot;I Ain't Mad At Cha&quot; foretold his death. &quot;I Ain't Mad At Cha,&quot; is also track number 13 on &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot; and Tupac died on Friday the 13.Weird huh?

B000000XCA|5.0|The first time I heard Bayou Country right after it's release in  January 1969, it blew me away.  This was truly a unique sound  that captured the imagination of practically every kid who had a guitar  or even the slightest interest in starting a garage rock band.  From the haunting, opening E7th chord salvos in \\"Born on the  Bayou\\" to one of the staples of 60's/70's pop, \\"Proud Mary\\"  and ending with the catchy, rhythmic \\"Keep on Chooglin' \\", this album continues to amaze me how it still grabs the musical psyche.  Creedence took the San Fran. rock style of the late 60's and made it a little more palatable to the main stream.  The grooves on side one of my original vinyl have worn through to side two. This album still remains close to my heart  as a favorite, and one that helps recapture a long-squandered youth.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I have to say that so many of the negative reviews here are their own best reviews. Boring, negative, trite, and pointless. At least they have the merit of being as short as they are lacking in insight or point. <br />The movie however is terrific. As most of its fans know, movies are about more than just a story. Those who can only look for soap-opera of cliff-hanger story here would be better off watching soap operas or cliff-hangers. <br />Coppola made a very good movie with &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;. She's made another with &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. They are, in most ways, not very similar, except that they do share a certain soft and likeable sensitivity. It is good to see her writing her own script, and getting much deserved awards for it, but I would like to see her do another adaptation like her first. <br />The idea that only her father's influence got her this movie is completely laughable. Just look at how popular it is with the public, and often with people who don't even like her father's kind of movies. I know she'll do another soon. I can't wait for it to hit the screens, further annoying the &quot;Matrix Ad Nauseam&quot; brigade. <br />At least someone out there is making movies for people with an IQ above 10. Not to be missed if you care about fine movies.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Episode 5, first 10 minutes when Ed Sullivan introduces the Fab Four sums up all the dynamics and enormous impact Beatlemania had on the world.<BR>Still,till this day there is no comparison. After you see the Beatles at Shea stadium you wonder either &quot;Why was I not there or why was I born too late...?!&quot;... The transition to Sgt.Peppers and the studio years also fortifies the claim that the Beatles were the greatest rock/pop band ever. Amazing DVD set.

0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is an amazing novel, it allows for the reader to learn some of lifes most pertinent lessons through the eyes of an amazing student and the teaching of an even more amazing professor.  This novel not only taught me about the importance of the people in your life but also that is important to cherish every moment that you have with them, not to waste time on pettiness, and not to dwell in the past or in the faults of others.  The student teacher relationship is an amazing dynamic in this novel because it extends far beyond the classroom.  By conveying this dynamic the reader can experience life through the characters eyes, and learn lessons about selflessness that you would never think possible.  This book is a true experience that teaches us all how to live life to the fullest.
B0001AP12G|5.0|excellent, this cd's beats have an old school flavor with a new school lyrical bite, absolutely genius, if you happen across this Kanye, thank you.
B000089RVX|5.0|It has some of the best music out there!!!!
0062502182|3.0|It has a nice underlying message. But the story isn't very moving.  And it wasn't in any way a &quot;page-turner.&quot;  Thankfully it was an easy read and fairly short.
B0001ADAVK|1.0|When movie first came out wanted to see soo bad. But i never had a chance over the Holidays. SO When it came out on DVD i was thrilled. the plot was SO bad it would go from one scene to the next and leave you totally confuesed. the dialoge was one the worst i have ever seen there was no teacher/student interaction. one of the actress.an involved Lisiban/ prostution lifestyle. and on a top of that a ton of sick sexual conversations were  going on  the sad part was that. they picked some wonderful actress in this movie if they just would  left out those scenes and the storyline that people follow it would been much better. it was as bad as my dead grandmothers dentures!
B000068TP0|5.0|I've only been a Shakira fan for about 10 months but I feel as if I've been her fan for much longer. With 4 of her CDs and 2 other DVDs (that accompanied 2 of these CDs) I finally persuaded myself to get this DVD about 2 months ago. And I am glad I did so. Although I'm not the best at Spanish I was able to fully enjoy Shakira's numerous performances and all the bonus features. With the help of English subtitles I was finally able to find out what many of my favorite Shakira songs actually mean! But even before then I fell in love w/ Shakira's music and her songs. In an age of manufactured super stars Shakira shines through writing her own songs and music, producing her own albums, and blending cultures and languages from across the globe. Shakira's performances are an hour or so of cultural experiences. From the sensual and mouth-dropping performance of Ojos Asi in which Shakira displays her grand talent in the field of belly dancing to the Mexican mariachi version of Ciega Sordomuda to the tear-jerking Sombra de Ti this whole DVD brings the talent that Shakira beholds into your home. I highly recommend it. All of her performances are well executed and rehearsed and the money I paid for this DVD was truly worth it. Can't wait for 'Live &amp; Off the Record' in 7 days! :)
0385504209|3.0|The only thing I'm sure of at this point is that The Da Vinci Code certainly doesn't live up to its hype. As someone who knows absolutely nothing about art history, I was fascinated by the impliciations of the protagonist's (a symbologist at Harvard University) unconventional analysis of Leonardo Da Vinci's artwork. But the more and more I learn about Brown's glaring inaccuracies (most of which the layperson to art history would not notice), the less respect I hold for the author and his book.<br />As far as the plot goes, I loved the first half of the book, until the characters got all nutty with the Royal Bloodline and the Holy Grail and whatnot. It was fast-paced, intriguing, and different. But it soon loses focus. As the plot gets more complex, Brown seems to think twice about the intellect of his readers. Whenever something happens, the implications are repeated. Several times. JUST TO MAKE SURE YA GOT IT. This is a thriller, a mystery, if you will. It's supposed to be subtle, not overtly user friendly. After the first half, this book just goes down hill fast. The simplicity of the riddles, and the difficulty these renowned scholars have figuring it out, gets annoying. The ending turns into a Oprah-like romance scene. And the revelation of the (once) enigmatic Teacher is disappointing to say the least. Anyone who's ever read a mystery before knows the bad guy is always the character you'd least expect. That's why most mystery authors have stopped using this passe technique, but unfortunately Brown has yet to catch on.
B00005ATQI|5.0|Best horror movie ever! Scary as hell! See this movie!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Yes, that was the sound of a movie going right over the heads of many. And no matter how much they say they &quot;get&quot; it, they clearly did not. If it didn't have anything for you, that's fine, but why the level of bile for a movie that clearly held much for millions? Whereas negative criticism of &quot;Titanic&quot; when it came out launched jihads against the critic, it seems to be praise that launches the jihads this time.<br />I see one negative reviewer call it immature (in a second - or more - negative review of it) and then compare it to the &quot;success&quot; of &quot;Rambo&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, and &quot;Die Hard&quot;. <br />Well if any of those are one's idea of &quot;mature&quot; movies it's really not hard to see why some of us are critical of the general US (and even world) audience's level of &quot;maturity&quot;. Granted they ARE about as &quot;mature&quot; as the MTV love story of &quot;Titanic&quot;. So if those are indicative of your taste, then rent or buy them. Small honest independent movies like &quot;lost in Translation&quot; aren't going to be upsetting the apple-cart and dominating the movie industry any time soon, so the world is quite safe for mindlessness. <br />And please don't lump today's commercial nonsense together with the great movies of the thirties or forties. In those days scripts more often made sense and weren't just formulaic pieces. &quot;Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; or &quot;White Heat&quot; were masterpieces of maturity compared to today's action films. &quot;Die Hard&quot; is such formula there has to be a &quot;resolution&quot; for everyone, no matter how unlikely. &quot;First Blood&quot; had some merit, but every Rambo film after that was as adolescent as you could get. And &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (I &amp; II) were just the apotheosis of commercials as movie making, and immature cop-outs at that (and were less brave or subversive - despite their attempts at looking cool - than Billy Wilder's &quot;Kiss Me Stupid&quot;.)<br />I see some criticising the hype over a fine small film like &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, and then defending movies, and an industry that - they proudly say - has dominated world cinemas... MOSTLY with hype, AND a marketing juggernaut. <br />Language advantages and a large captive audience that can make it profitable even to make garbage are a large part of the Hollywood advantage. So is US trade clout which has pushed to have movies labelled as industrial product rather than cultural product. And doesn't that make the mainstream Hollywood attitude clear enough! Maybe LIT is for people who still believe film is, or can be, a cultural product.<br />Yes, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; has got audience's bums on seats too. And outside of the US it has been sold on very little hype. <br />It's unproductive, inconsistent, and illogical to claim worldwide box-office as the ultimate judge of success and then claim all those who love this film and have made it make dozens of times its budget are wrong. <br />Coppola, working within the Hollywood system, has made a movie that reminds me of the best of earlier movies. You can do this, get this degree of freedom, if you keep your budget low enough. As you go up the ladder budget-wise the pressure to create immature action or comedy garbage only builds.<br />Truffaut, early in his career, liked CLASSY American directors like Ford and Boetticher. NOT every schlock-meister out there. He went on to make films in a quite different mould and films that found a wide audience despite Hollywood's economic clout. Just as &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is finding its audience with people who do not think maturity is defined by &quot;Rambo&quot;, &quot;Die Hard&quot; or &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;<br />I couldn't have said it better myself, but I will. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is for those of us who don't regard &quot;Rambo&quot;, &quot;Die Hard&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;. &quot;Titanic&quot; or &quot;American Pie&quot; as mature film-making, and I bless Coppola for it.
B00012FXB8|3.0|I don`t know why they made a third one. The first and second were masterpieces. This, is just plain wierd. This one is to violent and the violence takes away the chilling side of the movie. If they didn`t have all the violent scenes, this would be another alien masterpiece.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|This set is a must have for any Weezer fan.  It contains a remastered version of the Blue Album and a second disk full of B-sides from their singles and previously unreleased early versions of Blue Album tracks.<br />The album liner notes have the lyrics to all the Blue Album songs (not in original Blue Album notes) plus background info on how the songs came about.<br />...
B00000099Y|5.0|This album is my absolute favorite. It's pure genius, and I don't say that lightly. I'm amazed they can play so delicately (sometimes) in drop-D. How do they do that? Anyway, everything on the album is blended flawlessly, nothing sounds out of place. And the lyrics are so genuine, even Hooker With a Penis, ironically (buy the CD; you'll understand). Tool manages to push the envelope without sacrificing aesthetics and technical perfection. You can listen to it for a long time without noticing everything that's going on. Truly excellent.
B00005JMFI|5.0|Elf will land a spot alongside The Grinch (cartoon), Charlie Brown & A Christmas Story in my holiday video library! Will Farrell was hilarious & touching as the ever-cheerful,naive and polite Buddy. Bob Newhart, deadpan & stuttering as ever, was the perfect Papa Elf. The rest of the cast were ideal picks. A nice movie & a clever story. I needed a \\"feel-gooder\\" the day I watched it, and I wasn't disappointed.
B00005B36H|4.0|Tool has evolved quite a bit since they made Aenima. Lateralus seems to be more experimental in style. The lyrics are more spiritual and generally a lot less hateful than before, which is kind of nice. Don't get me wrong, though, they haven't gone soft. It just seems that Maynard has worked a lot of his problems out. The title track, which is about &quot;reaching up and reaching out&quot; describes the tone of the entire album. Their latest release is more free-form than Aenima, not as technically precise, but they're trying a lot of new things here. The rythms are still genius, though. The band is clearly a lot more mature. Definitely a good buy.
B00008PW2D|5.0|... I thought this is one of the best seasons it may be short but the girls are single and when they are single they have the best stories, it may have been a little to much money for two discs but i enjoyed every minute.

B0000AGWJ7|2.0|for starters, avenged sevenfold has been a pretty good band in the past-their last cd was pretty good, so i bought this one.  the music is different from their energetic old stuf, this is more bland, if you know what i mean.  i heard 'second heartbeat' on hopelessly devoted to you and thought this band still had some good music coming, but in their cd, they totally redid second heartbeat!  now its slower, the guitars are less daring, and the the singing is way more boring.  thats kind of a reflection of their first cd and this one! <BR>  as for their image--hilarious!  i dont know if they try to make their cd appearance look corny, but everything from the gay dancing skeletons to the \\"spooky\\" spider webs and cackling witch, is  screaming three-year old halloween party.
B00008DDRX|5.0|This movie captures the world of racing at it's finest in the early 1970's when Porsche and Ferrari battled it out for the World Championship. The racing footage is wonderful and the soundtrack brings the racing into your livingroom.<BR>All the acting cast brings to life the world of racing, not with special effects or daytime television &quot;soap&quot; styled scripts. Quiet characters who are involved or part of the international racing scene bring this movie to life. No &quot;over-acting&quot; here, just down-to-earth serious dialog that adds to the whole experience.<BR>The racing footage is spectacular...forget the computerized specials effects of today. This is as real and solid as it gets. I felt a part of being in a Porsche 917 or a Ferrari 512 while accelerating to 200+ MPH.<BR>This is one movie I was happy to spend money on...you can keep the &quot;Fast N' Furious&quot; for the kids.
B0000026UL|4.0|In 1988,Bob Dylan joined forces with Tom Petty,Jeff Lynne,the late Roy Orbison and the late George Harrison under the name The Traveling Wilburys. Dylan powerfully delivered his vocals to TWEETER AND THE MONKEY MAN,CONGRATULATIONS,MARGARITA and DIRTY WORLD. The following year,Dylan as himself(he and his 4 fellow TW's had aliases),put out this album which is precisely 39 minutes long. The tunes I like best are RING THEM BELLS,POLITICAL WORLD and MAN IN THE LONG BLACK COAT. This album was produced by Daniel Lanois,who produced albums for U2 also. U2 recorded Dylan's composition ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER. Also Dylan sang background and played harmonica on another U2 recording,LOVE RESCUE ME. Dylan has recorded countless albums on the Columbia label since 1962.
B000063COX|4.0|not their classic sound, but for sure their classic style.<br />The major stain here is the sound of the record itself. It is really old despite Brich's efforts at the time.<br />Other than that the album is probably the best first album that has been recorded ever, since first albums are usually poor in style and tecnisism.<br />With Phanton of the Opera Iron Maiden was showing that they were to stay, and not mediocrely, but to become a legend and inspiration for generations.
B000002L9Y|5.0|Ten years after Fleetwood Mac's blockbuster RUMOURS was released and spawned a record of nine hits,TANGO IN THE NIGHT spawned not as many,but four chart-topping hits. Lindsey Buckingham's BIG LOVE appeared on 1988's GREATEST HITS compilation but not on 2002's THE VERY BEST OF FLEETWOOD MAC. A live version of the song recorded in 1997 appears on TVBOFM. SEVEN WONDERS appeared on TVBOFM but not GREATEST HITS. On both compilations are EVERYWHERE and LITTLE LIES. FAMILY MAN has been recycled for the 2002 compilation also. Buckingham,Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie take the lead vocals on different songs on the album,of course. All three have recorded solo albums previously. All the other songs are excellent.
0805062971|5.0|and I read a lot. I saw the movie Fight Club at a friends house, and I thought it was strange, but yet very good. It was not like any other movie out there that follow the tradition that Hollywood likes to impose on film. Fight Club starts out with the main character, we dont know what his name is, but he goes to support groups for diseases he does not have, travels the country by plane until he meets Tyler at a nude beach. So together while at a bar, Tyler has him to hit him, his best shot. So begins Fight Club. There are three rules to Fight Club; One no one talks about Fight Club, Two, no one talks about Fight Club, Three, two men to a fight with no shoes or shirts. Then so begins Project Mayhem where each follower; the fighters, they each have a job, like one person's job might be to mold the soap so Tyler can sell it to the big shopping malls and such. <BR> Basically the book just gives guys a reason to beat the s*it out of each other, and to spread anarchy through soap making with human fat. The book ends totally than the movie, so if you saw the movie like I did, just read the first two chapters and skip to the last few chapters. The book and movie run close together.
B00005JMSE|5.0|unlike the other reviews on here who have just seen the trailer, i have indeed seen the actual movie. I saw it last week at a press screening in LA for Free. And i can tell you that this is a great action movie, right from the very start it starts with a bang. Del Toro is an amazing director who knows how to use light and shadow, his action sequences are down right amazing. Everything in this movie is top notch except for Selma Blair's character, she was just a little to timid compared to the character in the comic. Parting words: SEE THIS FILM!! you won't regret it
1400031362|5.0|The beauty of this series is its simplicity and non-formulaic pacing and style. With few words, with a seemingly simplistic point of view, complicated matters that go beyond the borders of Botswana are broken down into small parcels. The facts have life are not often so basically described.<br />One of the main aspects of the novel that I really love is the unpredictable pacing of the novel. Halfway through the story, a new and very important story line surfaces and without a lot of Hollywood-style drama, the story continues unfolding calmly, without exploding cars; wild, passionate scenes; predictable melodrama. Unlike most stories today, the plot doesn't build up to a dramatic plateau three quarters of the way through the story; rather it unfolds like rolling hills.<br />The plot is almost inconsequential compared to the telling of the story; it's the telling of the story and the point of views that make these books so captivating. This series successfully transports you to a new world and way of looking at life, something that can't be said for most fiction that I have read.<br />Between this book and Matt Lauer's report on Botswana, I am now looking forward to visiting this country someday.
B00018D44U|5.0|Like others, it took a few days for Feels Like Home  to grow on me. I couldnt wait for its release. Come Away With Me was so refreshing. I love about 7-8 songs on that album. Same thing with this album. It's original. I'm glad she didnt make Come Away with Me 2.
B000002UTO|5.0|I like this album, but I believe that you have to listen to it about 5 or 6 times before getting into what it has to offer.<br />Most of the ballads are great especially songs such as &quot;Palomino&quot;, &quot;Too Late Marlene&quot;, and &quot;Edge of America&quot;
B00016POFE|5.0|For those already familiar with the regular audio CD release you ain't heard nuthin yet! This DVD audio release is an incredible sonic upgrade. The surround mixes (DVD-A 5.1 surround and DTS 5.1 surround) are well thought out and really make listening a complete experience. The regular CD release was on sonic par with Pink Floyd's Dark SIde of the Moon. This release makes that one sound like an old 78. This mix opens up the soundscape and is chock full of ear candy in the surround speakers. There are three bonus audio tracks (all in surround) and three videos included. The videos contain disturbing images that really enhance the storyline. You'll be using this one to demo your system to friends-it's that good.  It would be nice to have their back catalogue receive this treatment.  Incredible.
B000002UTO|5.0|I think this album is pretty good. I don't particularly like dancing, still there are many tunes in this album that will make you move your body. On the other hand, I believe this album has many good and touching ballads such as &quot;Palomino&quot;, &quot;Too Late Marlene&quot;, &quot;The Edge of America&quot;<br />I also think that this is the kind of album that you have to listen to about 5 or 6 times before you can really appreciate it.
0689835604|2.0|this book is very colorful... the illistrations are very bright.... my two year old loves books and i purchased this one becuase it came recomended by his speech theropist, however, the flaps are easily torn becasue they are paper... cardbaord books are better for smaller children. It only holds his attention for a very limited time and my three year old won't even attempt to look at it... i know all children are diffrent, and i hope you children likes it better than mine do.
1400049628|5.0|You're sitting at home, casually watching The Simpsons. You've just gotten a call from your friends, saying that they were going to come by soon and pick you up for a game of bowling. Suddenly, the power goes out. You glance around. You don't really see anything that could have caused this, or that would be of any help. Unworried, you just sit back, and wait for your friends. When the moaning outside starts, you're getting annoyed at them pulling this prank. Then they break down the front door. You angrily storm in, and you see only a group of shambling, clumsy, disease-ridden ZOMBIES!<BR>The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks is a humorous, tongue-in-cheek book about the true zombie (not created through magic, evil spirits, or anything like that, but through a virus called Solanum) and methods to combat, escape from, and defend against them. It sounds very serious, except for the topic, and may make some people reading this start to worry and take precautions. Overall, it's a pretty good read, with plenty of helpful zombie combat strategy and laughs. Just make sure that this information becomes common knowledge when the dead do attack.
0312263120|1.0|Terrible.  No, perhaps it's supposed to be funny.  The factual errors alone are distracting for anyone who has any knowledge about the intelligence community (or anyone who has an IQ above 100)  If ignorance is bliss, then this book is downright giddy.
0066620996|5.0|\\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins is all about transforming average companies to great companies. Collins and his research team selected eleven great companies and contrasted with their comparison companies (who they feel are average) to understand why some companies make the leap and some don't. The team discovered that to be a good to great company needs to have a Level 5 leadership. Level 5 leaders are leaders who are humble, fanatically driven, understand the need to produce sustained results and they set their successors for even greater success in the future. The leaders also understand the need to get the right people in their organization before figuring out where to drive it. As Collin puts it \\"First who, then what.\\"<br />In addition, they understands the \\"Hedgehog Concept.\\" To quote directly from Collins, a Hedgehog Concept is a concept \\"to understand what your organization can be the best in the world at, and equally important what it cannot be teh best at - not what it \\"wants\\" to be the best at.\\" It is \\"not a goal, strategy or intention; it is an understanding.\\" It is also essential for the organization to build a culture of self-disciplined people (as getting disciplined people would limit the bureaucracy needed to compensate for lack of discipline), uses technology wisely (avoid technology fad), good to great transformation doesn't just happen with one single action, no grand program but instead follows a pattern of buildup and breakthrough. The organization is also able to confronts the reality of the company's current situation as the right decisions would follow subsequently.<br />\\"Good to Great\\" is truly an insightful book and it is very well-researched. His points are well presented as he uses analogies and stories to back them. It is an easy read as his tone is very conversational. There are some jargons but it is not too difficult for the average reader to understand. I like the way he structures the book with \\"key points\\" and \\"unexpected findings\\"at the end of each chapters. I find that helpful and the \\"unexpected findings\\" are quite interesting. For instance, 80% of their 84 interviews did not mention technology as one of the top five factors in their transformation. In addition, Collins considers \\"Good to Great\\" more of a prequel to his other bestseller, \\"Built to Last\\" as many would expect his second book to be a sequel. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the transformation of good to great companies.
0375422307|5.0|This book tells the story of a young girl growing up in Iran variously under the Shah and then the Ayatollah.  Using cartoon drawings to convey the message of struggle and survival against persecution this book will open your eyes to the truth behind the Mullahs and the Islamic law that was forced upon the people of Iran in 1979 after the Shah and his regime was deposed.  The story follows the young girl as she is forced to wear a viel and `modest' full body black robes  and then as se is barred from being educated with the boys and she witnesses the suppression of women as her mother, who had a good job and a college education, is forced to wear the same `modest' clothing and forced to stay home.<br />But this is a story of strength and perseverance against a tyrannical government.  This is in the tradition of Maus, in that it incorporates cartoons to tell the story of struggle through through the eyes of a child.  A must read for anyone interested in Iran or the affects of Sharia law upon society and for anyone interested in the status of women.<br />Seth J. Frantzman
0385336810|5.0|\\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" by Sophie Kinsella deals with Emma Corrigan who after a disastrous client meeting blabbed her darkest secret to a good-looking stranger sitting next to her when she thought her plane was going down. Thinking that she was going to die, Emma panicked and starting telling the strangers all sorts of things such as she wasn't sure if she has a G-spot, faking her examination grade, hating to wear G-strings, and so on. Her family secrets, work problems and relationship issues were all blurted out. Of course, it was only turbulence and the plane was not going down. <br />Emma was completely shocked to find out on Monday that Panther Cola (the place where she worked)'s American CEO was visiting and he turned out to be none other than the stranger she confided a few days ago. Thinking that Jack Harper, the CEO was going to fire her for lying on her CV but turned out he didn't. Soon, Emma had to face Jack daily and he was aware of all her darkest secrets. She thought things couldn't get any worse. Totally not anticipating this, Emma attraction towards this good-looking stranger increased. But then, there is also Connor, her steady boyfriend whom everyone thinks is perfect for her but she finds him not that interesting. <br />\\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" is extremely funny and fast-paced. There is no dull moments and it keeps leaving its readers wanting for more. There are times when I find myself laughing out loud (literally!). The characters are extremely likeable, and are extremely well-developed. Sophie Kinsella is definitely one of the best chick-lits authors out there and I highly recommend this book. If you enjoy her \\"Shopaholic\\" series, you'll enjoy this one too.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I wish i could give this 4 and a half stars.<BR>This is a great album, and by all means by it.<BR>The only reason I refuse to give it a five is because this band has a lot of potential and they can do much better than this album.  Near the middle of the album a few of the songs become monotonous (THEY SOUND THE SAME) which is annoying.<BR>If they drop the silly sounding voice and plunkity plunk guitars like they want to rip off the already awful sound of the Strokes, and stick with the spacey guitar, glowing voice, then they will do great.<BR>Forget the STrokes, the Hives, White Stripes, The Vines, that sound sucked the first day it was created. Puke.<br />Interpol needs to stick with bands like Radiohead, NEU, Coldplay, and artists like David Bowie.
0192833588|1.0|(Warning!! I do give hints to events in the book) Simply put the book is a romance novel that is very long and some what drawn out. It takes Austen pages to discuss how some woman brings her kids to social events so she can talk about them. Just imaging this going from one social event to another. I personally found the book sort of repetative after about chapter 18 of 50. It seems the only way the book is kept alive is by introducing new characters. If you are a fan of romance novels with one of those cheesy endings, then cheese it up with this four hundred page novel. I couldn't get any furhter than chapter 18, I got tired of nothing happening, specifiically action. Like in &quot;One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, which is an awsome book things happened. Not only that it was funny, but realistic enought to keep my attention. In conclusion if you like books were the entire novel revolves around the realtioships between people (soap opera) then this is the book for you other wise keep away.

B0000640VO|5.0|A shy young woman (Amelie) wants everything to be well with the people she knows so she plans and plots to bring a little happiness to each one of them in different ways. But she is shy about meeting her own true love. She hatches a scheme, a complicated mystery tour to catch the man of her dreams.<br />This is why I love the movies. Amelie is not your everyday dark film of murder, mayhem and ugly behavior; this is a dream world and the beautiful place I want to be taken too when I suspend reality at the door.<br />I watch in wonder at how the filmmaker embellishes such a simple story to create a delightfully rich tapestry, ripe with incredible images and subtleties of life. This is an excellent example of how all the cinema arts can be directed to create total magic.<br />Amelie is so full of originality, whimsy and nuance in this modern world of fast people and obvious everything. It is such a pleasure to be captivated by something that I would call a modern work of art.<br />This is a soft, lovable, puppy dog of a film. Catch it while you can and be transported to an amazing world far beyond the normal.
B000001TVD|5.0|the second song on the album is all worth it. the entire song(12 minutes) is all guitar. i recommend anyone that is in their right mind (or not) to give it a chance.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|It looks like the lovable little boy from \\"Home Alone\\" has grown up.  Macaulay Culkin is now in his early 20s and stars in this outrageous and rather sick story of Michael Alig, a real-life club kid of the early 1990s, who is now serving a long prison term for murder.  This 2003 film is not only his story, it is also the story of a time and a place and a world that it no more.  It's about parties and fantasy outfits and the shock value of indeterminate gender..  But mostly, it's about a drug culture that catered to these party people, and how it destroyed Alig's life.  Culkin does an outstanding acting job in the role, bringing a touch of humanity to the character as well as a great deal of ego and evil.<br /><br />Based on a book entitled \\"Disco Bloodbath\\" by James St. James, who actually lived through these years, the author is a major character in the story.  Seth Green is cast in this role and plays it to the hilt, a party person who likes to play but stops short of the excesses that push Alig over the edge. The rest of the cast is full of some of real party people, with Marilyn Manson playing a drag queen.<br /><br />One of the scary things about this film is how real it feels.  The small subculture of partygoers search for thrills, their makeup and clothing screaming for attention.  Their brains are addled with drugs and their purpose in life is only to draw attention to themselves.  It's fame without substance or meaning and its all mindless.  But, with the exception of the Culkin character, their carryings on doesn't really harm anyone but themselves.<br /><br />I didn't expect to like this film.  I almost shut it off after the first 15 minutes.  However, it was so intense that I just kept watching.  And I was eventually swept into the story and the people and the world that it depicted, a colorful bubble world which inevitably burst and is no more.  This film recalls that bubble, including all the horror as well as the fun.  Recommended.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Now, most of my musical reptoir consists of artists like The White Stripes, The Strokes, Blur, Weezer, The Cranberries, The Rolling Stones, The Who, and so on. In other words, I normally despise many goth/metal/shock genres. But there is something so beautifully poetic about Manson that stands out to me in a way that no musician - genre regardless - has ever been able to do before. I tend to dislike the more typical Manson songs, some examples being &quot;This is the New *hit&quot;, &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;, and other songs that are more shock than anything else. But his deep, emotional, painful ballads such as &quot;The Speed of Pain&quot;, &quot;Disassociative&quot;, and &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; move me in such a way with their beautiful instrumentals, soul-flooding lyrics, and passionate vocals that I can honestly say they are among the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Particularly &quot;The Speed of Pain&quot;, which starts out as nothing but vocals and an accoustic guitar and builds up until it reaches a full-fledged symphony of lovely echoing, enchanting sounds. That one five-minute song is an intense emotional experience in itself. <br />Mechanical Animals is most definitely my favorite Manson album. I find it comforting when I'm in a dismal, desperate, depressing state of being. It's almost as if Manson himself is whispering words of comfort to someone he's never even met. He describes the pain everyone feels so perfectly in his lyrics and instrumentals. It's incredible, he's a genius. A true artist.

B00005221M|1.0|I agree with everything the majority of the other viewers have said.  I love this movie, but this version is absolutely terrible.  Buy the original, or don't buy it at all.  Believe me.  I made that mistake myself.
0812968255|1.0|I picked up this more modern translation of this work, and phrases like 'junk' and 'if you keep putting things off' leapt out of the text. Consternation - did the Greek original actually have words like that? It was a 'modern' translation - 'modern' as in 'dumbing down'. <br />So I went looking for another translation, only 40 years old, but more faithful to the original, as in 'think of your many years of procrastination' rather than 'if you keep putting things off'. I don't view it as 'colloquial', I view it as patronising. <br />I'm sorry, but if you can't handle good English, and need the 'dumber' versions, then you're probably too dumb to appreciate the finer points of the work in the first place. Both versions were the same price, so that didn't influence my decision. <br />One reviewer mentioned it was translated from the Greek, and another reviewer corrected them as he was a Roman.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore is rightfully being dubbed the \\"Bernard Herrmann\\" (i.e., the infamous 'violin screech' composer from PSYCHO-fame) of our day.  And rightly so.  (The Herrmann influence may be most evident in the track 'Shelob's Lair.')<br />In a recent documentary, it is suggested that, with ROTK, Shore has composed the greatest soundtrack to date.  And Shore's comeback is (to paraphrase) well, \\"if it's true, it's only because I had the greatest movie as inspiration.\\"  True on both counts.<br />This is not euphoria speaking.  This is frankness.  Like all great masters of their respective craft, Shore ingeniously builds on the traditions.  There are tones of John Barry strings and John Williams percussion and brass throughout.  There are seemingly Celtic-inspired soprano and boy-soprano parts that mist the eyes with unfulfilled longing.  There are grand choral parts that unseat the soul (like a great action composition should).  Shore takes the finest traditions of like-genred films and blends them into his own, unique, and perfectly complimentary composition that stands on its own apart from the film that inspired it better than any other soundtrack to date.<br />And, if this is the greatest soundtrack ever composed to date (and I believe that it is), then no words convey the listening experience.  You must listen for yourself.
B0001I55OC|3.0|The only thing besides the characters that this movie has in common with the book is that it is slow to start.  This is a good movie to see if you like action and have no intention of reading the book.  I have learned to accept that no one has been to be able to do a fair adapation of a Michael Chrichton book since Jurassic Park.  Watch it for the sake of watching it, but don't expect it to faithfully represent the novel.
B000000OAA|5.0|Let's face it. Every Queen album contains filler. The amount of filler is directly proportional to how recent the album happens to be. In other words, the older the material the better it is - which is a general formula applicable to most artists as well as Queen.<br />Sheer Heart Attack and Queen II are by far the most solid albums of their entire catalog, with unparallelled inventiveness and eclecticism, not to speak of impeccable musicianship. <br />The two albums are stylistically and conceptually related, but since both cannot be reviewed here, I'll pick S.H.A.Q.<br />This album covers a lot of ground. There are elements of metal, classic rock, glam, progressive and art rock. Classical music is well represented, particularly with Freddy Murcury's piano playing, which has to be the most underrated in rock. While no Keith Emerson, Mercury is more than capable on the keys - after all he has had classical training, and it is evident throughout the album. The sounds range from the angelic and ethereal to titanic fury, sometimes in the same song. There is '30's pop as well - barbershop harmony and swing-style jazz, courtesy of Brian May, a true guitar scholar. Because of their eclecticism, musical adventurism and well-developed artistic sensibility, one may call Queen an Art Rock band.<br />&quot;Brighton Rock&quot; and &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; must be the very earliest specimens of speed metal, a genre Queen may have invented on their previous album, and revisited by other bands only a decate and a half later.<br />&quot;Leroy Brown&quot; is the first Queen attempt at '30's parody, and is outrageously campy, with banjo, tap dancing, swing-guitar, string bass and &quot;all that jazz&quot;. And, there is room for great harmonies as well. One of their best songs ever.<br />&quot;Now I'm Here&quot; - is grandiose glam-rock Queen style, Bowie should be envious. Great Rush-like guitar riffing, pre-dating Rush by a few years. (Did you catch that reference to &quot;Little Queenie&quot; by Chuck Berry?)<br />&quot;In The Lap On The Gods&quot; - This is Queen at their most pompous and progressive, just listen to the piano and falsetto intro!<br />&quot;In The Lap On The Gods ...Revisited&quot; - more great pomp rock, Brian May is the undisputed maestro of the leading bass note. Full opera choir comes in for a grand finale. Queen at their best.<br />&quot;Dear Friends&quot; - a mini-anthem, with just Freddie on vocals and piano, and background harmony coming in later.<br />&quot;Misfire&quot; - Feel-good classic rock, would be unremarkable if it wasn't for the amazing key changes and gorgeous harmonized guitars (of interest to prog fans!)<br />&quot;She Makes Me&quot; - good, but does not sound like Queen, therefore uninteresting.<br />&quot;Tenement Funster&quot; - same comment as above.<br />&quot;Killer Queen&quot; - this is what Queen is all about. Nothing more to add.<br />&quot;Flick Of The Wrist&quot; - nice piano intro by Freddie, venom and mayhem - this is Queen at their most melodic. The chorus reminds me a little of Elton John in his better days. Segues seamlessly into &quot;Lilly Of The Valley&quot;. Does Queen get any better than this?<br />&quot;Lily Of The Valley&quot; is a beautiful, ethereal, angelic ballad that rises to a great choral and instumental intensity towards the end.<br />Although music of Queen is almost impossible to categorize, the album has an overall Art Rock feel to it, due to complex and well constructed compositions, amazingly sophisticated symphonic arrangements (remember, they did not use mellotrons of synths) and self-mocking operatic pomp. <br />I am treading on dangerous ground here, but I'll stick my neck out and say that this is Queen's best and most consistent album. Of definite interest to anyone who enjoys hard rock, art rock or progressive rock.
0385484518|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was an assigned reading for my Sociology class at school, and after reading it I understood why my teacher assigned it. This book really made me think about my life and the people in it. Morrie was a great man and he had much to teach the people that he encountered. It is a very easy read that only took two days to read. I enjoyed how Mitch Albom reflected back and related it to the present time. I recomend this book to anyone who has had to live through the death of a loved one and to  anyone who might have to experience that, so basically everybody!!!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|People are putting down WM20 a lot, and its not right if u ask me. Behind WMX7, and perhaps WM19, this was the best WM put on by the WWE. WM20 had its share of downfalls, but overall the show is a big thumbs up. Here are the reasons why: <BR>The Rock and Sock vs Evolution, Y2J vs Christian, Eddie vs Angle, and HHH vs HBK vs Benoit were very very solid matches. <BR>Lesnar vs Goldberg was a terrible match, but yet it was memorable because of the crowd. This match will go down asn one of the craziest matches ever in WM history just for that reason alone. <BR>The Undertakers return was phenomenal. The entire atmosphere, the crowd... everything was great about it. <BR>Besides this, Cena vs Show was watchable, and the Cruiserwieght Open had some really good spots. The rest of the card was nothing to be talked about (The 2 tag title matches, and the 2 womens matches)<BR>But overall, this is definitely one of the greatest Wrestlemanias of all time, hands down. Just for the Undertaker's return, and one of the most memorable endings in Wrestlemania history with Benoit finally capturing the world title, this DVD is worth it. There are set to be some really good extras as well, but as far as the event goes itself it was one to be remembered. And the main event which was the 3way title match between HHH/HBK/Benoit will be remembered as one of the best main events in Wrestlemania history.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Identity...How can i explain this movie in words? When i saw it the FIRST time i kind of had to let is sink in. Then when i relized what a great thriller it was, i knew it was my favorite movie. What's not to like, you go you suspense, horror, and twists, and that's what makes a good movie. I have seen this movie a couple of times, and really looked at how the movie was made, and who the actors and actresses were. Amanda Peet, the star actress of the movie, is my favorite actor in the whole world. Her work is great, and she has done many movies. Ok... I'm getting off subject. The movie is about 10 people who get stuck because of a storm. A family, a newlywed couple, a callgirl, a limo driver, an 80's actor, a convict and a cop. What happens is people start dying one by one and everyone is getting freaked out. I can't say anymore because i will give it away but everything is great! Watch this movie, you'll enjoy it!

It is  intresting and you will never want to let go of it.It takes place in the future and makes you think, will this stuff or stuff like this ever happen in the future? I think that this book is a bit confusing some of the time and it is nice to have someone who has alredy read it  there to talk to about it.  It does have some volilence but I am glad I read it. Now, about the book. You are only aloud to have to cildren but this one cuple is aloud to have a third because they were going to give a perfect child to the IF to rase as a army to protect earth form some ailens called buggers. There first child, Peter, is to rough, strong and tough,  and stuff.There second child, Valentine, was to soft. She was to kind and  would give in way to esaliy. They neded someone who was very smart, wich both were, but they also needed someone who was inbetween Peter and Valentine. The third child, Andrew, who gose by Ender, is not to week, to strond, and is very smart. A kid tried to beat him up at school,but ender made him fall to the ground and then he did somthing else becaouse he is smarter then other firtgraders. At the age of  6 he was at battle school and at 7 and a half he was at a army and was no lonnger a lounchy, at the age of 9 he was a commander of a new army. It was the best army ever and he was winning evrybody. Menwhile down on earth his brother was trying to roll the world. He tried to do this by getting himself and his sister fake ieds and they wrote on the nets all over the place. He talked his sister into doing it and then one night at dinner  his dad was using some of the lines that she wrote. This book has such good detail and a very good plot and I could write a millon words about it but we can only write 1,000. I don't know where to begin or end this reveiw but there are a cuple of things I do know. THIS BOOK IS GREAT. YOU SHOULD READ IT AND IF YOU DON'T YOU ARE MISSING OUT. I HOPE  YOU READ IT AND ENJOY IT.
6305558167|5.0|An excellent movie and a very faithful adaptation of MAllory's Le Morte D'Arthur.  This isn't your children's fairy tale however.  Put the little ones to bed when you watch this gem.  Why you ask.  This is the R rated version of King Arthur's tale.  There is not shortage of violence, blood and gore associated with that violence, and sex that filled these tales.  Yes, these British people were not squeamish with blood and nudity back in 1981, but it does not take away from the movie.  It only strengthens it by making it more realistic and belivable.<br />This movie throws in everything from Uther's lust for Igraine and what leads to Arthur being born.  Merlin taking Arthur, Arthur pulling Excalibur from the stone, Morgana and Merlin's rivalry, Lancelot and Guinevere's affair, and Mordred vs. Arthur.  It also has the quest for the grail, which they could have made a little longer.  ... it was too easy.  Maybe they were afraid of the movie being to long (alread over two hours).  But nevertheless, it gets the job done.<br />The acting is excellent and the cinemetography is exceptional.  You almost forget that this movie was from 1981!  And I love how funny Merlin can be at times throughout this movie.  Excellent stuff!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|The film was a masterpiece and the soundtrack is incredible. Phillip Glass's repetitious musical style takes hold here in true genius form. Sad, exilirating and hypnotic- all at the same time. An achievement beyond compare.
B000059R8Y|3.0|I must say, when I first bought this album I was a little taken aback by it. It's not that I didn't like it, and it's not that I loved it at first... It was simply a sound that I wasn't expecting from a clapton album.<br />The first element I noticed about this album was the overall 'diversity' it showed with each track. All of Eric Clapton's solo albums end up running in the same vein or 'sound/production' to where this one has something for every Clapton fans taste(s). <br />What makes Eric Clapton so unique as a 'musician' is that whatever your taste is in music, he's made an entire album in that genre. Wheter it be in Country-rock, Blues, Soul, Pop, Acoustic, Psychadelic, Jazzyesque.. He's done it. Up until &quot;reptile&quot; he had never really recorded and released an album that encorporated all of those styles and in a way, this album represents all of the facets of Mr. Claptons solo career in one album. <br />The songs range from Rock-pop (superman inside), Blues rock (Come Back Baby, Got You On My Mind), Basic pop (I Aint Gonna Stand For It, Travelin' Light) Acoustic (Believe in Life, Broken Down, Modern Girl, Second Nature) Soulful R&amp;B (I Want A Little Girl), Jazzy (Find Myself), instrumental work/sountrack esque songs (Reptile, Son And Sylvia) and the bluesy ballad (Don't let me be lonely tonight). <br />The only tiff I have with this album is that it just never picks up. Even though the intensity of Come Back Baby half way through is the albums saving grace, the rest of the album is very somber. Unless you are truly in the mood for the WHOLE album, it tends to get a little boring at spots unless you are a person (like me) who listens to 'entire' albums.<br />Buy it and try it out, but with an open mind. It's got something for all Clapton fans in every aspect of his career. Now if you are only interested in a specific phase/sound of Claptons career then you won't be interested.  Promise me to be open minded about it, and have some fun.  <br />Take care,<BR>-The AndyMan-
B000002MUN|5.0|This album has changed my life.  It is what music is all about: pure, emotional, and chillingly good.  It is worth the money.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie is by far the best movie I've ever seen! It's the only movie that has made me both laugh and cry. Anyone who says it is insensitve obviously wasn't paying attention. The movie has two distinct halves: the first is comical and is about how the main character Guido falls in love with a woman named Dora. The second half is dramatic. This is when they get married and have a son and get taken to a concentration camp. It is sad to see the devotion Guido has to his son and how much trouble he goes to to make sure his son doesn't get horrified by the truth of what is going on.<br />The DVD also deserves 5 Stars. The picture is very clear and presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio (if you don't know what I'm talking about, go to [...] The Italian audio quality is also very good. But whatever you do, do not watch this movie dubbed! The English does not fit at all with the Italian, and some lines have been re-written (horribly) to better coincide with the Italian. Also, the actors who did the dubbing seem to switch back and forth between really fake Italian accents and American accents. Trust me, after about 15 minutes you'll forget you're reading subtitles, you just read them automatically without thinking.<br />All in all, it is probably wise to first rent this movie. It seems most people either love it or hate hit.
B0000073BG|5.0|What can I say, I have been listening to Renaissance for 30+ years. My kids, now young adults grew up with Annie singing her heart out and the group playing their beautiful souls. Now 30 years later I see a movie &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; and what do I hear but shades of &quot;Trip to the Fair&quot;. I need to confess I always felt it was out of place on this collection. It really made me sad. Now I know why. I never understood it, but after seeing the movie, it makes perfect sense. Go see the movie and then listen to this spectacular work of art. You will cry at the movie and when you hear this album (sorry CD). By the way in 30+ years I never tire of Renaissance. I may stop listening for a few months maybe a year but as soon as I pop any of their work in its like I am hearing it for the first time. The most beautiful music on earth from a collection of true artistic geniuses - thank you Renaissance. Please compile a music video or two.
B0000AOV85|1.0|If your looking for music, its not on this DVD.
0393316041|4.0|I thought this was a fun book about a tremendously unique and funny character.  I don't know a lot about physics or science or anything, but this book doesn't get bogged down with that.  Rather, Feynman explains to you in plain english what the issues or problems he was facing at different times were.  That's not half as interesting, however, as his creative solutions to the problems and his application of common sense to them!  This is more times than not what will make you laugh out loud.<br />The most insightful parts of the book to me were his experiences working on &quot;the bomb&quot; and his study of art.  These really show you his character on a more personal level.  You see the scientist in him, too, though.  The most pivotal thing I got out of the book was that you should never take someone else's &quot;proven&quot; theory for granted.  Always, always, always recreate the &quot;proof&quot; for yourself before you use it as a basis of further study.

B0000TLA9G|4.0|Actually, I'm suprised this took so long to come out, even though Axl and the boys didn't want it to. Too bad it's your typical \\"Greatest Hits\\". It does include some classic stuff though, like \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", \\"Patience\\", \\"November Rain\\", and of course \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\". \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"You Could be Mine\\" are pretty good too. I could have done without 5 covers, but at least they're not bad. I wish there was room for \\"Rocket Queen\\" and \\"Used To Love Her\\", but I guess those weren't really popular. Fortunately this does remind us of how much they rocked the late 80's, which is the point of such collections. ...
B00009TB5G|1.0|I am not a fan of the fantasy genre. So I was surprise to find myself so enthralled by the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien's books have to be read if you want to appreciate how he used the language (vocabulary, syntax) to indicate the race, history, class, morality of each of his characters. Moreover it is the incredible depth of his details: every river and mountain contains vestiges of long-vanished inhabitants of which only partial histories remain, the Fellowship's path crosses many other paths that might have been taken, but were not because of the choices each character made, that gives LOR its powerful quality of having *actually* once happened, in a *real* landscape. The reader's imagination is truly given wings for flight. <BR>  Finally it is only in the form of printed word that a character's inner dialogue with himself, his struggle with moral choices, his doubts can be fully developed, and that the reader has the time to savor and understand. (Be sure to look at \\"J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century\\" for more on this.)<BR>  But the entire inner, moral, and finally spiritual dimension of Middle Earth is utterly squashed by Peter Jackson into sense-jarring, superhero maudlin action-flick. Let's not talk his making the Elf Race into xenophobic, mechanoid fascist army. Let's not talk about Jackson's close-up sadistic fascination with gore which completely inverts Tolkien's refusal to treat battle scenes in detail (as he was concerned about the moral dimensions of war and evil, and not to titillate the reader). Let's not talk about how Aragorn's character is reduced to an Oprah-Show-like figure striving to believe in himself.<BR>Yes, the scenery is great. The views of the Mines of Moria are tremendous. The sight of Gandalf's horse troop, bent on saving Helm's Deep, galloping down a slope so absurdly steep as to make a live horse and rider tumble head-over-heels had me howling with laughter. <BR>Be forewarned. If you only see this movie, you will not haveany clue of why Tolkien has inspired generations of readers. If you have to do both, then read the books FIRST!
B000077VR3|5.0|If you like a story that ends happily, do not watch this movie.  If you favor a good drama that may invoke tears while entertaining you and surprising you at every turn, then watch it!  It's a DIFFERENT sort of film- it doesn't REMIND you of ten other stories made tired by overuse.  The only movie with a similar style I have seen is Romeo &amp; Juliet (another tragedy, of course).  If you didn't like that movie, you might not like this one either.
B00007ELEL|5.0|This is the definitive comedic installment of genius of our time.  Everytime this DVD enters my player, I know that for the next hour and 39 minutes, I will consistently laugh.  Not just &quot;oh that's silly&quot; laughter.  I'm talking gut-wrenching &quot;Bwah hah haws!&quot;  This movie is so ridiculously funny its legions of fans and impersonators don't even do it justice.  You know when one of your most non-funny friends is making you laugh just by quoting any line from this movie, that you have a classic on your hands.  Parts of this movie will just enter my head for no reason while I'm going about my day and I'll have to physically try getting the images of Walter, Donnie and the Dude out of my head so I can function.  I love this movie so much, I may have watched it more than anyother, but when you're partying or alone, and you suggest to anyone: &quot;Should we watch Lebowski?&quot;  The return reply is always, most assuredly, a heart-felt &quot;yes.&quot;  The only hard part is when the film ends...you just want more.
B000002KIK|5.0|It always facinates me to hear the guys in Sabbath say they didn't care for albums like Sabatoge and Never Say Die. I think they remember the events surrounding the albums more than the actual music. Never Say Die is a fantastic album no matter what anyone says. You really won't find the classic sludge of Master of Reality on Never Say Die but you will find Sabbath acting like a real group and expanding on different styles in the same manner Zeppelin did. If Sabbath released a new album you can bet it would be a bit more 'by the numbers' and that would be fine since we all want a new Sabbath album anyway. But this is probably the most diverse album Sabbath ever did. Does this mean this is the quinissential Sabbath album? Of course not. But it does mean it's a great album to really hear what Sabbath was capable of, regardless if you dig their ideas at the time. Once Ozzy was gone, Sabbath took a step in the new metal sound of the time and an album like Never Say Die would never be a possibility following this. Buy this album and dig it.
B000053VJI|4.0|This cd is a wonderful compilation of the greatest hits of Juan Luis Guerra's music over the years. I couldn't of compiled it better myself. If you are familiar with and like Juan Luis' music and are looking to have some of his best on one cd this one would satisfy your requirements. I like most of the songs on the album although there are some that are not good as the others. The big hits on this album that seem to always hold strong are: La Bilirrubina, Burbujas de amor, Ojala que llueva cafe, El costo de la vida & Bachata Rosa. However, popularity varies from region to region. But I must say this album has power because in every Latin country that I have visited in the past and present somehow from a store, a car or a house I would hear this album playing and could imagine the joy that it brings to its listeners.
076790592X|5.0|I read this book in ninth grade. It tells how the narrator meets with his former professor who is about to die. Morrie sounds very intellectual that he doesn't like the idea of traditional funerals-he'd rather have people share their remembrances of him while he's still living the remainder of his life-they hold a \\"living funeral\\". If you know somebody is going to die and the dying person still knows what's going on, living funerals are a thumbs-up!  Great book for the death of a close one!
B000002C1W|3.0|For those of you who think it ain't Pink without Roger, get over it.  Genesis was still a band after Peter Gabriel left and they managed to continue to make some fine music without him.  Same here.  If you want &quot;old&quot; Pink there's plenty of recordings out there that will stand the test of time.  And this &quot;new&quot; Pink is flawed but a great step forward.  The production is incredible.  &quot;On the turning away&quot; is as good a song as there is and Gilmore's guitar playing is emotional and stinging.  Remember, it's all about the songs and there are at least 4 on this cd that are as good as anything they ever recorded.  While not as complete as &quot;Division Bell&quot; this is a fine album to behold.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a super album.  I've heard bring me to life on Daredevil and somewhere else.  Very powerful.  Now I love the entire album...
B00006AW2P|5.0|Keep in mind that when this album came out it was part of a huge wave of lps from countless British Groups that followed the Beatles to America.  What kept the Stones from just becoming another Manfred Mann or Gerry and the Pacemakers?  One listen will tell you.  This album absolutely sizzles with youthful, naiive enthusiasm and it didn't try to imagine that it would spawn &quot;Top 40&quot; hits like the Fab Four were dominating the charts with.  They were true to themselves and their passion for R&amp;B and it set them apart from the pretenders from the first cut.  It still represents the best of what the Rolling Stones stood for and set the pace for their next 6 or 7 albums to come.  Would-be rock and roll musicians at that time wanted to look like George Harrison but they wanted to play like Brian and Keith!
B000075BFK|3.0|Yet another attempt to cash in on his unreleased material, Tupac Shakur's estate should definitely have made sure that what they were releasing was credible for at least 50% of the project. As bad as that may sound, 'Better Dayz' is not an entire wasted effort as the album does have some highlights.<br />The 2 disc set is pretty even when it comes to the share of the album's best tracks. 'Still Ballin', 'Street Fame', the playful 'Late Night' and the acoustic version of 'Thugz Mansion' do not disappoint, but being listed in various places, it doesn't help disc 1's level of consistency. Disc 2 however does include my favourites such as the title track, the slow but meaningful 'Fame' and 'There U Go', which is perhaps the nicest sounding song on the album - not forgetting the peaceful 'Who Do You Believe In' featuring late Outlawz member Kadafi.<br />Unfortunately, as a whole, the album failed to really satisfy as most songs are remixed or re-edited for commercial release and features rappers and singers (Nas and Mya most obviously) who Tupac would never have worked with in life. Its unfortunate as 'Better Dayz' is strong lyrically but fails greatly when it comes to the beats behind them.<br />A worthy Tupac album, but not the most fulfilling - cop it anyway.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have a great time listening to this. I love every song on the CD and it's great to have a CD where you like each and every song. <BR>Britney found the right producers this time and I'm glad she did because she was kinda getting old with that Max Martin guy. <BR>The standout songs are  - Toxic, Everytime, Breathe on me, Touch of my hand, Showdown and the remis of MATM. I also love Hook up, Brave new girl and Shadow a lot. The original version of Me against the music is a classic club song and is very good as well and Britney and Madonna's voices kinda blend well. Boom boom is a great song though I feel the Ying yang twins didn't have to shout so much. Early Morning is also a good song. <BR>Overall rating 4.5/5<BR>I loved this CD and I'm sure all music fans will. However, I do not recommend this for anyone below thirteen/fourteen. The lyrics of a few songs are not meant for them.
B00005RYLE|4.0|When asked my favorite series of films, I will likely say THE EVIL DEAD.  As far as horror series go, &quot;Evil Dead&quot; is definitely my favorite.  &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; is the first film in the trilogy, a low-budget film with a $250,000 budget that ended up being one of the most popular and influential horror films ever made.  Drawing inspiration from films like &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;, &quot;Evil Dead&quot; was the first film to demonstrate Sam Raimi's creative genius.<br />The story involves five friends (your typical 70's college students) who travel to an abandoned cabin in the woods.  There, they unwittingly resurrect evil demons which have one goal: to scare you out of your skin - literally.  You see, these ain't just flesh-hungry demons: they're flesh-possessing demons.  With the friends being picked off one-by-one, in the end, only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is remaining.  Now it's up to him to save the day (or night) and get the hell out of there before the demons reach him.<br />Sam Raimi, who is in fact much more of a Three Stooges/comedy fan than a horror fan demonstrates his creative genius here.  The story was surprisingly original, and the script is filled with suspense and scares.  Then there's Tom Sullivan's terrific effects; there's enough barrels of gore here to make even the strong-stomached feel sick.  Joseph LoDuca also contributes a creepy score; Bruce Campbell's performance is good, but comes nowhere near being comparable to his role in the sequels.<br />I loved &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; when I first saw it and still do.  It is one of my favorite horror films, and undoubtedly a horror masterpiece, using all the tricks in the book while creating some new ones.  &quot;Evil Dead&quot; is a true horror classic, and essential for any and all horror lovers.<br />&quot;I know that my wife has become host to a Kandarian demon.  I fear that the only way to stop those possessed by the spirits of the book is through ... the act of ... bodily dismemberment ...&quot;
B00006879E|1.0|Well, here's another one of those bands where the hype machine has been turned up to 11 for them, but if you expect them to deliver, you will be disappointed.  The members of this band were once a bland Weezer knockoff (Kara's Flowers), but after releasing an album in 1997 that went nowhere, they added another member to the band and rechristened themselved Maroon 5.<br />The result: Unconvincing suburban R&amp;B with no passion or originality whatsoever.  Imagine NSYNC picking up instruments and deciding to poorly mimic the sounds of Jamiroquai - this would give you a pretty good idea of what Maroon 5 sounds like.  Their vocalist is even a dead ringer for Justin Timberlake, only more nasal.  The songs themselves have all the marks of inexperience: plenty of cliches (&quot;Beauty queen of only 18...&quot;) and all the song topics are pretty much the same - pleading with some girl to come back or telling them to go away.  It's like they had one idea and decided to stretch it out over the course of a whole album.  The album title &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; suggests that there is a running theme, but with each song more or less expressing the same sentiments as the next, what's the point?<br />The album's low point comes in the form of the dull ballad &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot;.  The song's maudlin sentimentality makes it sound like an Air Supply song, and the vocalist sings the chorus through a vocoder which makes him sound an awful lot like Cher - a frightening combination if ever there was one.<br />In summary: this band is not worthy of all the hype and praise that they have received.  If you even remotely enjoy this, pick up a Stevie Wonder album and you'll forget Maroon 5 even exists.
B0000844IT|4.0|&quot;Army of Darkness&quot; is the third film in Sam Raimi's legendary &quot;Evil Dead&quot; trilogy.  Surprisingly, while it was the least popular of the series in theaters, it's arguably now the biggest cult hit in the series!<br />Picking up where ED2 left off, Ash (Bruce Campbell) finds himself in 1400 A.D., taken prisoner by Arthur's knights.  Soon, he finds that the only way he can return to his own time is to retrieve the Necronomicon (a.k.a. Book of the Dead).  Of course, there are some complications: he'll also have to save his girlfriend, blow up his evil clone, and destroy an army of the dead.  Armed with those ever-so-trusty weapons, the double-barreled shotgun and chainsaw, Ash sets out on his quest to return home.<br />&quot;Army of Darkness&quot; is one of the few films that successfully blends comedy with horror.  AOD is, in fact, much more comedy than horror.  Ash is outrageous, albeit a little more pissy than in the previous films.<br />One of the interesting things to do with this film is to look back at the other two films and see how far along the ED crew came.  Bruce Campbell's acting improved by ED2, Sam Raimi became a more experienced director, the scripts changed from gore-filled horror to laugh-out-loud comedy, Joseph LoDuca went from creepy 70's horror score to booming medieval soundtrack...<br />There are two versions of the film: the original theatrical version (nicely remastered on this DVD) as well as the Director's Cut (horridly &quot;mastered&quot; on this DVD).  I would highly recommend the D.C. to the T.C., but with the quality of the D.C. on this DVD, I can understand it if you stick with the T.C.  (Woah, that was a mouthful!)<br />All in all, &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; is even more rockin' now then it was ten years ago.  Filled with bone-rattling action and groovy comedy, AOD is a film only Sam Raimi could make.<br />&quot;Shop smart, shop S-Mart!&quot;

B000002513|5.0|My first Springsteen album was The River, but I soon realized that there was a wealth of great music on the four albums that had come before it.  (I'd heard Born To Run and Darkness On The Edge Of Town, but Greetings and The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle had passed through while I was still in my top 40 phase.)  Originally fished out of a dollar bin in a local used record store, I was amazed to find that it was nearly the equal of Born To Run.  The only semi-clinker on the album was Wild Billy's Circus Story (but I'm sure there are others who LOVE this one.)  I found early on that the six tracks that I loved from this album meshed with those that I loved from Greetings.  They weren't cohesive in any way, but together they made a great side of one of my favorite driving tapes.  At this point everyone knows about Rosalita, but this album offers so much more than just that admittedly great concert staple.  I think what makes it one of my favorites in the car are the constant tempo shifts, from the placid New York City Serenade to the wildcat energy of Kitty's Back and Rosalita, this album delivers a whole spectrum of emotions and sounds and is a great find if you've never indulged before.
B000002UB3|5.0|As a child, I was exposed to the Beatles all the time; I'd heard bits of nearly every album, and to this day, I'm recognizing songs I'd thought I'd never heard before. There were three albums I'd never really heard: Please Please Me (which is so-so), The White Album (which I've only heard a little of), and their final album, the masterpiece Abbey Road.<br />That's right: Abbey Road truly was the final Beatles album, having been recorded last. I know that Let It Be was released after, and I don't really know why, but I prefer the more natural (musically) flow of White Album - Let It Be - Abbey Road.<br />It brings about an interesting question: if your band, in four years, has created itself to be the greatest music phenomena of all time, and you know you're only making one more album before you split, how? Simply, how? It's certainly no mean feat, and I know I would be intimidated as hell in addition. But this album is masterfully done, and a worthy end to a great musical legacy. Let's review:<br />1. &quot;Come Together&quot;: A surprising, and surprisingly surrealistic, start for a Beatles album. Certainly, they haven't done too much like this before, and it gives this album a fresh start. The lyrics are nonsensical enough to be really enjoyable, even though this song is about some guy John and Yoko met. Quite the treat.<br />2. &quot;Something&quot;: This song is, simply put, beautiful. I used to not like it, back when I was musically thick, but now I can really appreciate the time and soul investment a song like this takes. I can no longer help but sing along whenever I hear this song. It's just amazing.<br />3. &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot;: Wow, this song is really funny. The overtone is just so not serious it's hard to believe this song is about a serial killer. Yep; Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine, kills his girlfriend, then his teacher, then the judge trying him, and the Beatles managed to put a super happy face on the whole thing. Great stuff.<br />4. &quot;Oh! Darling&quot;: This song is Beatles rock at its best. The screaming bridge is just great, and the guitar fits in really well with the bass and piano, along with the background oozin' aahs. Another one of my favorites.<br />5. &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;: One of the few songs Ringo Starr (who I guess turned into Graham Chapman) wrote, this helps balance the album while lightening a potentially serious mood. I love the underwater singing during the guitar solo. It's just like the Beatles, really.<br />6. &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot;: This slow song is really deep, and gets really heavy and involved later in the song. I would call this their last great shot at experimentation, and it turned out really well.<br />7. &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;: A very upbeat mood lightener, Here Comes The Sun was the last song off this album I ever heard as a child. This song is really simple in concept, but delivers a message so powerfully in implementation. The gradual buildup during the bridge is really amazing. 8. &quot;Because&quot;: An interestingly slow song with very nice lyrics and great harmonies. This seems like another balancing song, probably to offset what the finale brings.<br />9. &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;: This is a fun song to listen to, as it changes mood abruptly halfway through, to a tune that reminds me a lot of the tunes played while showing Vegas in movies. A nicely written song.<br />10. &quot;Sun King&quot;: This song is a lot like Because, but it signals the beginning of the Beatles finale, which I liken to the finale of fireworks on the Fourth of July; a bunch of small fireworks go off in quick succession before the big bang finally comes.<br />11. &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;: The first finale song, this is an interesting short tune about a homeless old man; it's mellow and wacky at the same time.<br />12. &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;: A harder song, probably as close as the Beatles got to modern hard rock. This isa great old song, and the old sound just adds to the effect.<br />13. &quot;She Came In Through The Bathroom Window&quot;: A great short story song, spawning from when some fans made it past security one time. The melody is really catchy, and the guitar is a great offset.<br />14. &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;: The beginning of the end, Golden Slumbers is a great short song as well, with very nice lyrics and a spot-on melody. My dad had planned to sing this to my brother as a lullaby.<br />15. &quot;Carry That Weight&quot;: This song has a lot of meaning for me, as whenever I listen to it, I invariably look back on four amazing years of Beatles music, and it leaves me, simply put, awestruck. All of this leads right up to...<br />16. &quot;The End&quot;: It's the end, and the only way the Beatles could have ended, in my opinion. They knew, at a time when this really was the end, that this was the last impression they would leave with the world, and it shows; if you listen to this song while realizing all of this, you'll achieve temporary enlightenment. The rock portion is very powerful with the context, and the buildup is strong, but not too strong, leading up to the Beatles' final, mystifying, beautiful, ultimate message to all of us:<br />&quot;And, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.&quot;<br />Could it really have been any better?<br />17. &quot;Her Majesty&quot;: Do you remember in Family Guy, on &quot;Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows&quot;, when Pearl has just died, and Peter has just let the baby birds go, and it's a very sentimental scene, and then the doctor comes and looks in the room, then turns around and yells, &quot;Hey! Who wants to see a dead body?&quot;, and the whole mood is shot straight to hell? This is exactly what this song does. It really could have gone somewhere else.<br />Even with that tiny imperfection, this is the greatest album of all time. It certainly sold like it, and it's affected me personally in ways I can't describe; I just tried, and probably screwed up big time. But don't take my word for it. Go buy the album and see its greatness for yourself.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I confess that I did not have a high opinion of \\"Pearl Harbor\\" when it was released three years ago.  However, I changed my mind when I rented the movie this past December.  I found the film to be very entertaining and a sincere effort to honor those who lost their lives that day and to all the veterans of World War II.  As a student of American and military history, I expected and accepted that there would be some historical inaccuaracies.  However, I was surprised and pleased by what <BR>the film got right[.]<BR>...<br />Overall, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" was a very satisfying movie and I am glad that I have had a change of heart and now own a copy <BR>...I applaud the cast and crew for a job well done and thank them for their homage to <BR>our veterans.  If this film inspires our citizens to learn <BR>more and remember that \\"date which will live in ifamy,\\" than \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is truly a worthy effort.
B00003CX5P|1.0|this movie is a joke, george lucas is couting up the $$ he's making off of this new trilogy trash and he doesn't even have to bother coming up with a good script. he just uses a bunch of special effects and slaps the star wars name on it and probably laughs at all the people who shell out their money to see it.
B00008EYA5|1.0|I remember there was a movie once, in which the psychopath told the hero; \\"the only way you'll know what happened to your wife is if you experience it yourself.\\" Said wife was buried alive, which metaphorically refers to what should be done to SWAT - buried deep into the hole from which it came from, mind you. And yes, to ultimately discover how bad S.W.A.T is, you do have to see it for yourself.<br />Imagine the following. Ron Jeremy and Danny DeVito holding hands. Running towards you. In slow motion. Covered in syrup. Naked. Yes, that's simply how terrible this movie is. Vomit inducing garbage. ... And where it isn't painful, it is annoying. A circular stairway into the pits of hell.<br />The plot is virtually non-existent. It seems this is one or two S.W.A.T episodes glued together with paperglue - some parts ripped off, some parts glued on top of each other - like a kindergarten students' artistic work. In a way it is like an abstract piece of art one cannot come to understand. Ever. <br />The characters are utterly miserable and clichéd. There is the \\"by-the-numbers\\" captain, the hardened veteran, the roguish rebel, the tough cop female partner, the shape shifting turncoat and the sacrificial family guy. Deja Vu, anyone? Probably so, you will have seen these characters before. I am disappointed. Samuel L. Jackson's talents are truly wasted in this junk-food-like spoof. A complete waste of time, and hour and a half I cannot take back. An hour and a half during which I could have sat and done nothing, which would have been better than watching S.W.A.T, quite frankly. Avoid at all costs.
B0001ADAVK|1.0|WHEN I FIRST HEARD ONE REVEIW ON THE MOVIE THEY MENTIONED THE MOVIE &quot;DEAD POETS SOCIETY&quot; THAT MOVIE WAS WONDERFUL. THEN I SAW THIS ONE WELL SUCKED. I SPENT AOLMOST THREE HOURS SEEING SOMETHING COPYING A MOVIE I LIKED AND NOT VERY WELL. I LOVE A LOT OF JULIA ROBERTS STUFF. BUT SHE WAS TERRIBLE IN IT AND IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME. I DIDN'T LIKE ANY OF THE CHARACTERS AT ALL. AND IT NEVER REACHED A GOOD POINT. EVEN AT THE END WHEN KIRSTEN DUNST FINALLY COMES AROUND I WANTED TO HIT HER. THE OTHER THING IS IN &quot;DEAD POETS&quot; THE DAD WAS MEAN AND CRUEAL AND YOU COULDN'T PUSH HIM AROUND. IN THIS I FELT I COULD TAKE THE MOM. SHE WAS ANNOYING AND EVEN IN THE 50S YOU COULS SEE THAT. ALSO THE SPECIAL FEATURES AREN'T THAT GOOD AT ALL. IF YOU INTO THEM THEY HAE A SPACE THAT HAS TRAILERS. THEN YOU GO OUT TO THE MAIN MENU AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER SPACE THAT SAYS TRAILERS AND THEY WERE THE SAME ONES AS IN THE OTHER SPACE. THE  CAST DIDN'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT THE MOVIE BUT THEY ONLY TALKED ABOUT THE TIME PERIOD. I HATED IT AND THINK PEOPLE EVERY WHERE SHOULD BURN IT!
B0000BWVCM|1.0|NOW I REALLY LIKE HUGH JACKMAN AND ALL BUT EVEN THIS WASN'T HIS BEST PERFORMANCE. NY PROBLEM IS THE COULD HAVE GONE ANY WHERE WITH THE SCRIPT BUT THEY DIDN'T. THEY ALSO TRIED TO BUT SO MANY NEW CHARACTERS IN THAT THEY DIDN'T FOCUS ENOUGH ON THE MAIN CHARACTERS. ALSO THE LEFT IT OPEN FOR A SEQUEL. I HATE THAT! THERE WERE TO MANY GOOD ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE THAT THEY WASTED. I THINK THAT IF THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT ANOTHER WAY IT WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT GOOD. IF YOU ASK MY OPINOIN I WOULD SAY IT DOESN'T MATCH THE QUALITY OF THE FIRST ONE. I GUESS THE STUNTS AND CRAP WERE GOOD BUT I DON'T LOOK AT A MOVIE JUST SEEING IF JACKIE CHAN CAN FLIP A GUY WITH ONE PINKY. I DON'T CARE! IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND CARE ABOUT A STORY THIS WILL BE A DISAPOINTMENT AND A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! DON'T CONSIDER IT FOR A MINUTE! IT'S TRASS!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|This trilogy could have ended in the middle of this movie and I would have been happy.  the first one was an intriguing glimpse into a complex world while being accented by good action.  The second movie was a GREAT sequel.  It left you guessing and was a total cliff hanger.  The one thing that was consistent was that this was a dark world.  With such a dark and downtrodden first 2 films the last one should end on a serious up note.  No major bad news in other words.  This was not the case for this film and about halfway through stopped showing any hope for a positive resolution.  It angered me that a series that could have gone down as one of the best ever took such a \\"blah\\" turn.  I would say see this movie if you liked the other 2 just to complete the story, but buy it... no.
B00000JBCP|4.0|As so many reviewers have said this is an excellent CD to get whether you're already a Mana fan or if you just want to get to know their music. <BR>Unfortunately, though, there are a couple of flaws. First, a couple of tracks are misnamed; &quot;Te Solte la Rienda&quot; is actually Track 6 and &quot;Desapariciones&quot; is Track 7. Secondly, the track breaks don't always make sense. For example, the talking at the end of Track 6 is the actually the introduction to Track 7 and would make much more sense either as its own track or at the beginning of &quot;Desapariciones.&quot; <BR>I'm nitpicking, but for good reason. If the music industry wants consumers to buy CDs then the production quality should be higher than what we can create off our home computers.
B00003003R|4.0|Guns n Roses have to be one of the most electrifying live bands around, and for those who never had the chance get youre ass to a concert(or maybe you did and just didn't feel like waiting 3 hours for them to come onstage). Live Era is the perfect chance to hear GNR's hard rock rumble in all its glory. As far as live albums go Era deserves a hearty &quot;were not worthy&quot;. In their best moments GNR combine raw unbridled energy, whiskey drenched attitude, snarling riffs and wails of defiance into a sound that is utterly impossible to disregard. &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; is 9 minutes of some of Slash's best guitar playing(including a voice decoder solo that puts Bon Jovi's Richie Sambora to shame). &quot;Paradise City&quot; sounds better then the studio version and all the AFD hits(Nighttrain, Out ta Get me, Mr. Brownstone, Welcome to the Jungle) utterly drip of so much intensity youll be kicking yourself if you never saw them live. Axl's voice does seem a little too over worked on &quot;Sweet Child o Mine and &quot;Estranged&quot;, maybe all the cigarettes and backstage Jack and Cokes finally got to him. However,the weaknesses of Era lie not so much as in whats there as whats missing, wheres Illusion triumphs like &quot;Coma&quot;, &quot;Civil War&quot; and &quot;Locomotive&quot;? And many will especially be dissapointed with the band's decision to leave &quot;Don't Damn Me&quot; on the editing room floor. Theres also no history as to where and when each show was played and which lineup took on which songs, leaving the listener to ween out clues themselves. Still although its a shame GNR didn't try to harder to seal their contribution to the history of rock n roll, its a damn fun album to listen to and as one reviewer said, it captures the spirit of Live GNR which is, &quot;A rock n roll bash where everyone's smashed&quot;.
B000088E6D|5.0|'Enhanced' is an excellent title for this CD.  Buble enhances music that cuts across three decades and updates them with a new sound.<br />Michael Buble could be the one who brings back swing and big band and he revives the love song.  His voice is clear and fresh.  He breathes new life into tunes of yesteryear and even does a better job on many of them compared to the originals.<br />I heard this CD at a friends house, my wife and I love it.  This is romantic, lilting music that will inspire you.  I would not say that Buble is better than Sinatra, yet there is no comparing Buble's singing talent to anyone else.  His rendition of Kissing a Fool was excellent.<br />&quot;For Once in My Life,&quot; he sings that with full lung capacity and makes it very snappy. &quot;Come Fly With Me,&quot; is really a kick, upbeat and perky.  I really like his rendition to &quot;Put Your Head on My Shoulder.&quot;<br />This is a tribute to the time when music and America were great.  This is going to be a gift I give to many of my friends over the next few months.
0792164903|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie.  Tim Burton's masterful artwork is shown to the maxium in this beautiful film.  Based on the famous, yet humorous tale, &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&quot; by Washington Irving, this movie takes that folk tale to a whole new level of suspence and mystery.  <br />Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane, a forensic scientist, who is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate several horrific murders, all found with their heads 'removed.' Ichobod, a man of sense and reason, does not believe in the Headless Horesman, who the townspeople say is behind these murders, not until he sees him for himslef.  Crane makes several discoveries that leads him to believe that the horesman is being controled by a person of flesh and blood.  Ichabod falls head over heels for the mysterious Katrina van Tassel, played wonderfully by the beautiful Christina Ricci, who has secrets of her own.  <br />After much investigating, the person behind these murders is revealed, too much of the audiences suprise.  <br />This movie is fantasic and I whole-heartedly reccomend this book to anyone who is a fan on Tim Burton.
6305161879|3.0|I had the opportunity to watch this after watching Fierce Creatures first.  Actually, I was glad I saw that movie first, because I personally did not like this one.  Wanda had a lot of potential and had a lot of witty things in it not tried before, yet, the crudeness made me a little tired.<br />Interesting to see how things lightened up in comedy in the 90's compared to this 1980's flick about crime.  There were definately some very funny scenes, Kevin Kline showing up all the time was really fun, wondering what he would say when he did, and the gem to me was Michael Palin chasing after a witness that he trying to off.  That had me in stiches.<br />I rated this movie a three because of the concept of attempting to get to the stash by whatever means possible was very clever.  Cleese in court was outstanding.  This movie will be liked by most, however, there is too much language and crudeness as you can see in the other reviews.
1401300901|1.0|oh my, this was painful to get through.  I only did it because it was a bookclub pick.  If I had time on my hands I'd go through and count the hundreds of times characters &quot;laughed hysterically&quot; or were &quot;shocked&quot; or &quot;tears spilled&quot;.  Such juvenile writing, and no inner substance in the main character.  The only well-plumbed depth of feeling related to the sense of loss, but other than that, it felt like writing for a bad sitcom.  If you're at all interested in this book, save yourself some money and check it out at the library as you won't be wanting to keep it on the shelf.
B000002TP7|5.0|Again, the Beastie Boys, modern histories greatest thinkers/rappers/punk rockers strike gold with a deliciously ecclectic record in &quot;Ill Communication&quot;.  This album starts off strong with &quot;Sure Shot&quot;, a funked out classic.  Root Down, Sabotage, and Get It Together are the big tracks on this CD, but the real pleasure of this album are the punk and instrumental tracks slipped between witty, jazzy rap tracks.<br />The Beasties truly have their own style, and its hard to argue against it... Its that CD that you listen to over and over again on a roadtrip, rhyming along with the 3 MCs.<br />If you liked Paul's Boutique (an absolute triumph) then pick up this record, the more you hear from the beasties, the more you'll like them.<br />Long story short, its a classic gem that leaves no track unlistenable... When it comes to the B-Boys, you can't seem to go wrong
0553674447|4.0|Although this is a return to the magical Kingdom of the Six Duchies, magic is really a secondary element of this story, even though it figures prominently in the plot.<br />FitzChivalry Farseer, the hero of Robin Hobb's previous trilogy, is fifteen years older than when we last saw him.  He and Nighteyes, the wolf whom he has Wit-bonded with, are now living far from the court where Fitz grew up, and raising the orphan boy Hap.  But it seems that court intrigue will just not leave them alone.  One day Fitz's mentor, the assassin Chade, pays him a visit seemingly out of the blue.  A few days later the Fool, the mysterious former jester of the court, drops by and stays for several days.<br />This is only the beginning of a story that does contain magic, but it is really more about a man who has never truly been able to live on his own, without having to answer to anyone; and about a boy who has much in common with the young FitzChivalry Farseer and who needs to learn about growing up in a hurry.  In that, it is truly a story of a major aspect of the human condition.<br />As I said, there are also many magical aspects of this story.  The telepathic ability known as the Skill is explored in some detail, and the mystical man-to-animal bonding called the Wit in even more.  And the book also delves into some mysteries that are left unanswered - hopefully they'll be answered in the other two installments of this trilogy.  The most prominent of these is, who exactly is the Fool?  He is a being of many talents and many faces, none of which appear to be his true one.  We want to know more about him, but every statement he makes about himself, though apparently true, poses more questions than answers.<br />This book is a complete story in and of itself, but I definitely want to read the other two installments, if only to (hopefully) discover the secret of the Fool.
B0000074CU|4.0|Rory Gallager was one of the last true great guitarists.<br />This CD shows his talent evolving, to I believe his peak in 1974 with the Irish Tour CD and DVD also available.<br />A master blues guitarist with vocals more fiery than Eric Burdon.<br />This CD has average sound but worth getting for the performance of Sinner Boy alone.<br />Rory Gallager is the guitarist Eric Clapton should have been in the 70s, listen to this and you will know why.
B00005JMQ0|5.0|Some anti-Vietnam War critics who disagreed strongly with the policies of Robert McNamara as Secretary of Defense under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson have criticized Errol Morris's Oscar-winning documentary for allowing certain statements of the controversial Washington bureaucrat to stand unchallenged rather than present a rebuttal or at least other viewpoints.  A better way to view this documentary is to consider it as one of an ongoing series of oral history presentations assisting us in understanding the vital issues of war and peace.<br />What makes this documentary so gripping is that McNamara is confronted with important questions by producer Errol Morris in a spontaneous exchange, and must come to grips with them before an audience seeking responses.  He is still visibly shaken over his role in the Vietnam conflict and concedes that he was ultimately forced out by Johnson due to policy differences rather than resigning of his own accord.  In the manner of Washington tradition for the lavish, he was given a grand sendoff ceremony by the man who was dumping him for policy differences.<br />Despite the fact that McNamara does not answer the pivotal question of, as stated in his autobiography, if he ultimately knew that he was sending off troops to a war he knew could not be won why he continued to do it, his uncertainty allows us to study the all too frequent response of someone under pressure, unable to take the ultimate step to free body and soul.  As a result McNamara continues to agonize, aware that he was sending young men to die in a war he knew would never result in victory.  He can never know, for instance, the peace and resolution that someone like Richard Goodwin, who concedes that Johnson had treated him like a son, could know for resigning in spite of pressures due to his strong opposition to Vietnam.<br />Another fascinating point in the film is the discussion of how close America came to war in the Cuban Missile Crisis.  McNamara providesenormous credit to then Russian Ambassador Llewelyn Thompson for engineering a ploy that helped avert nuclear conflict.  Thompson publicly disagreed with President Kennedy and, due to his close involvement with and knowledge of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev,recommended that he respond to the first of two communiques sent to the Russian leader, the first much more conciliatory than its blustery successor.  While the clever ploy has been cited in other works on Kennedy and the period, the showcasing of Thompson's role in the decision provides important addendum to the record.<br />It is to be hoped that Errol Morris will continue in the same vein as \\"Fog of War\\" in approaching the historical record by confronting individuals who helped shape it with important questions designed to illuminate the public.  A chlling element of this film is when on the scene Cold War active policy participant McNamara states bluntly that the only reason we avoided nuclear war was by being just plain lucky.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I found this movie amusing. I love the Matrix clothing, and I love vampires, and though it was light in the plot, I didn't think it was a waste of my time. I actually enjoyed watching it, and will no doubt watch it again, and see the sequel. <br />Some people here have been downplaying it for certain aspects, such as vampires having reflections. Ok, first of all, get real. We're talking about vampires. Anne Rice's vampires have reflections, too, and aren't allergic to garlic, won't die from a stake in the heart, and can't be held back by a crucifix. Bram Stoker's Dracula could go out into the sunlight, and metamorphose into a flock of bats. Every culture has some vampiric entity that has different attributes that make it its own unique type of vampire. Personally, I think most of the popular vampire lore is silly - and much of it can be traced back to folkloric beliefs. Yet, I enjoy it all. <br />I only gave it four stars because I feel they could have done better with the execution of plot twists and character development. Otherwise, I recommend it.
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|I have to agree with the real death metal heads:  this band trys (and ultimately fails) at being a death metal band.  This brew, at best, could only be categorized as &quot;emo-metal&quot; IMHO.  Besides, one wonders how competent these musicians are at their instruments when EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM IS IN THE SAME KEY.  (How much variety can you muster with that limitation?)  Maybe they planned it that way.  And if they did, perhaps they should have named their opus, the &quot;EEEEEEE&quot; CD?
B00012FXAE|5.0|I think this DVD is awesome. It has a lot of interesting information about how the movie was made and also gives us the selection of the two versions of the film. Plenty of extras to choose from including interviews with the actors and behind the scenes info. The quality of the movie itself in outstanding. One of the best films in Sci-Fi or War! James Cameron does so much with so few resources and the acting is phenomenal. As far fetched as the plot is, the story of Space Marines taking on Acid bleeding aliens seems very realistic because Cameron wanted it that way: people afraid of dying, gear not working or breaking, human characteristics such as confusion, fear, isolation, and greed make this seem like it could really be happening. A great film.<br />The only bief I have with this, however, is that you can't find the ALIEN VS PREDATOR trailer that was advertised with this DVD. This is worth every cent with out it, but if its there, we should know how to access it. If you know how to do it, please let me know.
B00005G95H|5.0|Originally released March 1983, on Harvest/EMI in the UK, Eire, and Europe.  I have the UK tape and CD.  As you all know, this was appropiately the last with Roger Waters, who turned in his walking papers to CBS and EMI two years later.  He beaugards (sic) this record, as he wrote and sang each track, much to the chagrin to David Gilmour, which was setting the duo apart which endures to this day.  Both would retaliate with solo debuts the following year.  Nonetheless, this was another stepping stone in Waters' unique lyrical style of what I see as socio-political commentary, which he would go further with in his solo career.  A handful of these tracks were used on his solo tours, but not by Floyd without him.<br />The Final Cut is supposed to be a follow-up (besides just in sequence) to The Wall.  It's darker than Dark Side and The Wall, the anchors of the Floyd lexicon, yet this album was overlooked here, since The Wall LP, tour, and movie had become overkill.<br />This was reissued worldwide last year by Harvest/EMI/Capitol with \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" as a bonus track.
B00008EYA5|1.0|Even by summer action flick standards, this movie is pretty bad.  Why did they even bother making this?  It was so cookie-cutter generic and predictable.  I kept thinking maybe they were setting us up with this paint-by-numbers plot, only to throw in some huge twist at the end, but no such luck.  This was one of the few movies I've seen where I was able to predict each and every event that was going to unfold with nauseating accuracy.  Even this review is generic, for cying out loud.  Yes, this movie was so bland that it actually infects everything it touches and renders it disgustingly uninteresting.  Case in point;  I used to have a sense of humor and an active social life before the day I watched this movie.  Ever since then,  all I can think about are state bailment laws, APA format, Leon Uris, and fluctuating interest rate trends on home equity loans.  My friends have all alienated me due to my incessant rambling about stuff nobody cares about.  Even now, I ramble on.  Don't you just want to shoot me?  Don't let this happen to you.  Stay away from this movie.
0141301120|2.0|This book is not that good. Because there aren't too many things happeningin the begining. And then it just switches subject and another thing happens instead. Somrtimes it's very funny but when it's not funny, it's a very boring book.<BR>    However the characters in the book are guite good. My favorite character is mr. Willy Wonka. He is very funny and he's never scared.<BR>    I don't recommend this book to anyone, but if you want to read it it is better to read \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" first.
B00003CXI0|5.0|You (and a few others) hate this movie.  Thats fine.  But if you hate this movie why do you have to write a review that is so long that everyone falls asleep reading it?  Just tell us you hate it.  We don't care why.  And fyi Ron Weasley has red hair in the movie because he did in the BOOK.  Don't insult him and say he's high or gonna come out of a cereal box.  Grow up.  I like to see you or anyone else do a better job.  Most of the actors are just kids.  Quit being jealous cause they have a ton more money than you.
B000001GQU|5.0|Ever since I purchased a recording of the Tchaikovsky 4th symphony conducted by Fricsay years ago  with the RIAS orchestra, I have always been on the lookout for his rather scant recordings available to the public.  His old Decca recording of the Tchaikovsky I still bellieve is the best interpretation on vinyl disk, hands down.  Similarly, this monaural version  of the great Verdi opus grabs the listener from the beginning and holds on  until the final chords of music vanish from the pages of the text.  I simply like Fricsay in more ways than none and here is proof of my sensibility toward this eminent conductor.
B00008DDXB|5.0|I hate to tell you Kristen but the actors are British because the movie and books takes place in LONDON.  How dumb would that be if an American actor played Harry or anyone else?  This movie is awesome just like the first one.  I can't wait for the rest.
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World is a complete experience. I must admit I was not a constant reader. Nevertheless I have always been interested in Philosophy, and Gaarder's book is the best way to keep you interested in a great story along with all the knowledge you can acquire. Usually Philosophy History is hard to read and understand if you're not into philosophy itself. But Sophie rides with you into a very easy, understandable course on every important philosopher along human history. I really recomend this excelent work.

B0000042H4|4.0|I feel that the tempo, casting and general style of Solti's Ring is great. The performances and the quality of recording are of a particularly high standard. Of course there is Nilsson but I think Gerhard Stolz is great, as Mime, as Aegithus in Solti's 'Elektra', as Herod in Solti's 'Salome'. He always plays the revolting characters with great drammatic effect.<br /><br />For me the first act of Siegfried embodies all that is great in Solti's Ring Cycle, appropriately paced with the drammatic tension created by the discourse between Siegfried and Mime keeping you totally hooked.<br /><br />Solti's Ring also has problems. When it comes to the big scores such as 'Ride of the Walkyries', 'Siegfried's Funeral March' (in particular) and the finale to Twilight of the Gods, Solti's bombastic style can be quite irritating.<br />He seems to have a habit of placing undue emphasis on the brass which has the effect of drowning out the strings. Such pieces are played too loudly and lack subtlety. 'Siegfried's funeral march' for me is particularly disappointing. Indeed I have noticed a trend in many of Solti's works to drown out the strings; 'Salome' and 'Elektra' for example. The orchestral emphasis (in particular on brass)in these recordings serves to make it difficult to discern the lyrics.<br /><br />So, in some respects I think this is a brilliant recording but for the big scores Solti completely messes up. Whilst I have not heard any other of the 'classic' recordings I would imagine Bohm's rendition is worth its salt if his 'Tristan und Isolde' is anything to go by. I feel that Bohm produces a better orchestral balance than Solti on the whole.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Greatest Hits compilations tend to limit themselves to just that. So you end of with a group of songs that represent the list of songs that have been played to death on the radio already. In 1986, when I wanted to get into Aerosmith- what did I go out and get? Greatest Hits, of course. I think it's useful for this to be out there for the same reason. Five years from now, some kid will just be getting introduced to rock n roll and will probably get this to see if he/she wants to go any further and buy more G N R CDs. Of course I was disappointed that my favorite G N R song \\"Nightrain\\" was left off- but, then again- that would have to be left to a \\"Best Of\\" since it was never released as a \\"single\\" and, therefore, could not really be a \\"hit.\\" But, then again- why would \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" be included? Greatest Hits and Best Of compilations tend to disappoint the hardcore fans because there is ALWAYS something left off. These tend to be geared more towards the beginners. This one is for the kids who are getting tired of hip-hop being forced down their throats- or the kids who just want to hear a band that doesn't sound like it needed to develop a little more in the garage before it got signed- or even the kids who just want to know what a guitar solo is. Since G N R is my favorite band of all time- 5 stars always for the music. Of course I would've preferred to have an option to buy a version of this with a bonus disc of hard-to-find material- like the \\"Live from the Marquee\\" B-sides of \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" (a superior version, in my opinion) and \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" as well as the \\"left off of Live Like A Suicide\\" track \\"Shadow of Your Love\\" (not the horrible remake G N R recorded as a B-side to, I believe, \\"Live and Let Die\\"). To all of the reviewers who seem confused by this release and, therefore, have to give it a bad review- just remember- this is not for you. Give it to someone you know who is just becoming a teenager and help keep rock alive.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I see a couple of comments on boom mikes in this movie. I'd just like to point out that this is a common problem when a movie is shot full screen for later cropping to wide screen. The cinematographer tends to favor the widescreen format, and it's the sound guy's job to get as close as possible. <br />Not only that, when a movie is projected there's a &quot;safe&quot; area that should never show on the screen if a projectionist is doing his job properly. Sound recordists will often put the boom in that safe area for the best sound. <br />I've seen this movie in widescreen format, both in the cinema projected properly and on DVD. I saw no boom. I'll stress. This is projectionist error, particularly when you view the movie in the &quot;wrong&quot; format. Not filmmaker's error.<br />Second, about those DVD previews. I wonder if some of the people complaining actually HAVE the DVD. There is a superimposed caption telling you that you can fast forward through them.<br />Unless your DVD player has some problem, it's just not true that your controls won't work. The DVD producers COULD have made that happen if they wanted to, but at least they didn't go that far. <br />They're not bad previews, and for good movies, but still, I do sympathise with those who give the DVD a bad mark for this. I would be furious if more DVDs were produced that forced me to watch previews. Certain kind of movies - like &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; - are bought by film-lovers anyway, who would DEFINITELY check out the previews voluntarily.<br />All the same, I find the movie itself to be a marvellous, quirky, sentimental, even poetic experience. I'd like the DVD to be better but I'll accept its drawbacks for the chance of seeing this wonderful flick again and again.
0385504209|2.0|Everybody complains about the history.  &quot;These details are wrong, the history books say this...&quot; and on ad infinitum.  It's fiction.  Says so on the copyright page.  Fiction.  Grounded in reality, but ultimately made up.<br />That people give this book one star for &quot;being bad history&quot; is just grossly ignorant.  It is not a history text, it's a novel.  And, it's a BAD novel.  The plot speeds along, and is the book's saving grace.  There is little to no characterization, and clunky prose that sticks out like a sore thumb on subsequent rereadings.  (I admit that I was flummoxed by the quick pace of the book, only on review did I realize just how badly it was written.)<br />I bought this for my fiance for Christmas cause she likes DaVinci, and for making her happy, it gets five stars.  No stars subtracted for being &quot;bad history&quot;; four stars subtracted for being too badly written for the money I spent on the hardcover, and one star added for a quick plot that glosses over all the obvious problems.<br />&quot;Almost inconceivably, the gun into which she was now staring was clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino.&quot;<br />?<br />-Evan
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I made a review of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; a few days ago, but it has not appeared here. I saw the film on a plane going from America back to India. Usually I do not watch the films on planes because it is to hard to concentrate but I watched this one all through. <br />I think it is a lovely film. Bill Murray plays a very kind and funny man. It is easy to see why a young lady will feel some closeness. And Scarlet Johnson is a very sensitive actress as a young lady who's husband seems to not love her very much.<br />I enjoyed to see the Japanese city and country. And the experiences they have in Japan were like when you go from a small town to a big city. This film made me cry. And it did not make me feel like it was trying to make me cry like sometimes films do. And it is a very quiet story. Not like I am used to in films, but sometimes in books.  It is a very wonderful film.
076790592X|5.0|I picked up this book 1 year ago at a friend's home and read a few pages.  I left my friends home &amp; never got around to buying a copy of Tuesdays with Morrie for myself until nearly a year later!  <br />I just finished this book and I am forever changed!  To see that there was a person with so much knowledge, so much love and so much compassion brought tears to my eyes.  <br />Morrie is someone who will truly never die.  He touched the  heart of his family and friends, but through this book, he will continue to touch the herats and souls of every person lucky enought to pick it up.<br />In such a difficult world, it was wonderful to take a few moments each day and read about a man who had made good choices - probably hard ones - and regretted very few.  It is even better to hear of a successful person who vowed to never eploit others.  Sensible, courageous, compassionate - these words describe Morrie!  We need more people like him!
0385504209|2.0|A highly overrated book.  The primise is kind of interesting if you toss reality to the winds, but this guy Brown couldn't create an interesting character if his life depended on it.  Shallow, stupid dialogue, irrational actions, dopey scenarios (after a gut shot, chould the good perfesser do all that artwork?? C'mon...) make this a loser.
B00005JKC3|1.0|first, i should appreciate the director of this movie, Li Ann.<BR>After awarding OSCAR prize, he continue his style, direct a movie that mixed any elements he can.<br />When i saw this movie, the scene which gave me a deep impression is, Hulk feel angry and change his outside looking to a greeen monster, you may feel shocked by the direct tech that Li Ann who want to give you.<br />Last, just like most people said, this movie is not bad, and I bagan to look forward Li Ann's next stuff^^
0671027387|1.0|To sum up this book in one word &quot;brutal&quot; comes to mind.  Dan Brown did not follow-up Angels and Demons ( which I found to be the best) and DaVinci Code well at all.  The story is boring, the characters are boring, and worst of all the whole thing is very predictable.

B000089RVX|4.0|Make no mistake about it, although it's mainstream pop music, this album is very good. This isn't goth rock, lets get that straight right now, but it is dark rock music that has found it's way into the popular music charts of Mtv, VH1, and local Hit Music stations across the country (something not easily done). Bottom line, this is a great album, well worth the money, and definatly worth a listen
B0000057C5|5.0|I first heard Rammstein back in 98 when this album first came out and saw thier video for du hast and i loved the song and video. They are very unique and have a distinct sound.

B000007T1M|1.0|this is NOT heavy metal...this is NOT crazy...this is NOT talent...this is some kind of rock, and its very bad.  why do people say the solos are crazy, or its heavy, fast, or complex? here you go:  you want solos? listen to children of bodom, sinergy, onward...you want crazy listen to mr. bungle or fantomas...you want fast listen to slayer or soilwork...you want complex listen to spiral architect or death...you want heavy listen to deicide, morbid angel, cannibal corpse...basically, if you want some kind of heavy metal with talent or thought behind it...stay away from this, the 'anti-metal' man, americans really know nothing about music
B00004BZ0V|5.0|If you have never heard the clash before or are interested in hearing thier music i say get this cd or London Calling- both are great cd's. Some of the best songs on this album are london calling, train in vain, i fought the law, Rock the casbah, and should i stay or should i go. Excellent collection of classics and Highly recomended.
B0001A79JO|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this album... to put it simply, I love tracks 1 through 6 and strongly dislike tracks 7 through 13. The obvious best song is Where They Wander, and, well... then there's Kool Flattop. <br />They do, however, have a very original sound. I really don't understand why there is so much comparison between Patricia and Gwen Stefani. I am a huge fan of No Doubt and just can't hear a similarity. If anything, I'd say she sounds more like Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo. All the vocals and instrumentals are of bitchin' quality.<br />This is a fun, high-energy album with a unique mixture of sounds. There is something on it for a fan of pretty much any genre, and I'd recommend it to everyone.
B000068IEU|1.0|Last house on the left sucked. Story was about 2 girls who get kidnapped and then try to get away from these psycho druggys and end up dead, then the family of the girls seek revenge. I saw this film once, i could not beleive wes craven did this. This film is horrible, and not cause its low budget either, texas chainsaw massacre was low budget and was an excellent film. I dont know how anyone can find this movie scary, the end of the film isnt shocking at all its just some father coming after them with a chainsaw and then it ends. The characters in texas chainsaw massacre were scary and disturbing and in some parts funny but these characters had no charm or scaryness about them and they certainly are not memorable, just a group of drugged up whackos. I cant see how this is groundbreaking , maybe for the genre it was but this film is very bad. Not recomended at all.
0385510438|5.0|I believ the negative comments are from those who like CNN and USA Today - they like their stories in sound bites. This is a rich, warmly told tale that is a story, not a mystery, but a story. And a fine one at that.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|I bought this DVD because I was told by a friend it was &quot;Funny,&quot; and with Bill Murray, I did not question it any further.  My mistake.  The representations of Japan are very interesting, but the movie has little plot and you will have to search very hard to find much humor (at least not Bill Murray style).  Later, my friend informed me that she had not seen the movie, but had heard it was funny.  I Have seen it, all of it. I found it slow and uneventful.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I believe this is one of the best films I have seen in years. At first I thought it was a little slow. Then I got in to it and got hooked. It was awesome when I found out it was a true story.<BR>How does the Academy Awards miss stuff like this?
0385504209|4.0|On the positive side, it was impossible to put the book down, from the opening scene through the 75% mark. It was so engrossing, it was difficult to even pause and think about all the codes and enigmas yourself. The action is fast paced, quick short chapters jumping around. An Excellent and exciting read.<br />Then things slow down, and they start not making sense. Regardless of all of the little nit-picking criticisms of inconsistencies, etc, I just can not overlook one major flaw.  Forget about all of the religious details...if you take it as a work of fiction they don't matter.  But the plot still has to work.  And for the plot to work, we have to understand what the goal of grand-pere was in his dying moments....protect the blood line, preserve the link to the Grail.  So why would he put in motion a series of puzzles where the last cryptex would (even mistakeably) point to Sophie's brother and grandmother. Sophie was definitely in danger, but the sacred bloodline was not...because Sophie's brother was safe.  Nobody knew of his existence (it is almost as unlikely as finding the Grail). So why leave a trail of codes that would lead someone to him...even the risk of leading someone to him is a huge mistake. It makes no sense. If the goal was to have Sophie find her grandmother and brother...just about any other way makes more sense and is less dangerous. The twist at the end just creates too many problems.

B000002OX7|5.0|If only all reclamation projects turned out like this.  &quot;Who's Next&quot;, as nearly everyone knows by now, was the result of Pete Townshend's &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project collapsing under it's conceptual weight.  Townshend's attachment toward &quot;Lifehouse&quot; has often made him seem distant when discussing &quot;Who's Next&quot; in interviews; his emotional disappointment is palpable.  &quot;Who's Next&quot;, however, is The Who's finest album, and one of Rock's essential works.  From the pioneering synthesizer sequencing of the opening track to the thunderous closing of &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;, The Who is a band firing on all cylinders. The best performances of each individual member are here, melded into one glorious volley of styles and sounds. Pete Townshend may have been disappointed, but the rest of the world was astonished.  The extra tracks included in this re-release are an interesting snapshot of what The Who was up to during this period, but the original album itself towers over everything else.  Which, of course, is how it should be.

B0001FR3IQ|2.0|GOTHIKA follows standard horror-thriller conventions (especially the red herrings and cheap scares) and it's technically well-made. But . . . the anticlimactic third act finishes with a ridiculous finale with muddled disclosures and plot holes galore. GOTHIKA wants to be a supernatural ghost story, a woman-in-prison movie, a wrongfully accused movie, a murder mystery, and unintentionally, a comedy! Not awful, but not that good either.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This film is funny, and may be one of disney's and Pixar's best computer animated Film.
0790729725|5.0|This is one of the most amazing films I've ever seen.  It has drama, makes you want to keep watching, gruesome scenes of mafia &quot;hits&quot;, and loads of profanity. &quot;what am I, a f***ing clown? Here for your f***ing amusment?&quot; Ah, Joe Pesci was the best.  Too bad they whacked him-errr, i mean.... Joe Pesci lives.  Anyhoo, buy this movie, stock up on food, watch it, watch it again, keep watching it, don't go outside for a month, keep watching it, and, oh, did I mention you should watch it?
B00009V7P8|5.0|The first time I heard &quot;Cannonball,&quot; I got goosebumps and immediately knew I had to go sample more of this artist. I have to admit that I bought the album based on that one song and have absolutely no regrets, other than to wish I had discovered Damien Rice sooner. I haven't been this impressed and amazed by an album by any artist, established or new, in years. <BR>The melodies are almost ethereal, as are the vocals. The lyrics, for me the most decisive element in music, are so penetrating and beautiful that they occupy my mind for hours, after I turn off the stereo. I hope Rice gets the attention he deserves for this stunning debut, and that he records another album soon...
B00006V9A0|4.0|This is a good cd, but they should have included their better songs, like Serve the Servants, Frances Farmer, Blew, Hairspray Queen, Very Ape, Territorial Pissings, and Aneurysm...and why do some of you people come here just to bash Nirvana? It's not like you're going to change anyones opinion on them just by saying that they are talentless, which is actually something that could be used to accurately describe The Beatles.
B00006WUWQ|5.0|I have always enjoyed Mike Myers.  He is a great comedian and is one of the best.  But in the Austin Powers series, he does his BEST work out of all his movies.  He is funny and will make you laugh out loud.  Great movies for the family if your not to harsh on the movies the kids watch.  What I mean by that is if you didn't let your kids see such movies like Mars Attacks!, Beetlejuice, Batman, Batman Returns, The Mummy, Dumb and Dumber, Police Academy and Scary Move 3.  If you would let your kids see those movies, than these movies are perfectly harmless.  So, make some popcorn and get groovin with Austin.  <br />Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery-This is a great film in the series but isn't exactly my favorite of the lot.  It's hip and hilarious.  It's a riot to watch.  Me and my family laughed very hard.  Ok when it comes to features.  But I have seen better when it comes to features.<BR>9/10<BR>Rated PG-13 for nudity, sex-related dialogue and humor.<br />Austin Powers in The Spy Who Shagged Me- This is my favorite of the series by far.  It's gross with humor and it's very funny.  It's gross when Austin drinks Fat B's crap.  Funny, but sick.  Anyway, the acting is perfect and the begining is one of the best parts through out the movie.<BR>9/10<BR>Rated PG-13 for sexuel innuendo and crude humor.<br />Austin Powers in Goldmember-This is a funny film but just by a sliver wasn't as good as number 1.  Anyway, the acting once again is perfect and the humor keeps flowing in over and over again.  Yes, it is the grossest of the series by far.  A couple sites even posted it to be rated R.<BR>9/10<BR>Rated PG-13 for sexuel innuendo, crude humor and language.
B00005AQE8|5.0|this album is straight fire.the great ones all have a classic- jay had reasonable doubt and biggie had life after death.the thing that separates pac is that other than the rose that grew from concrete (which he didnt even rap on) every album that he dropped was a classic.in my opinion this was his best.top to bottom on both cd's i haven't found one track worth skipping.my favorite tracks are ambitionz as a ridah and all eyes on me.but it's hard to just single out &quot;the best&quot; songs on this album when they are all GREAT. this album had 6 singles, sold millions, and was pac's most commercial album but i really do think it may have been his best
0060934913|4.0|kitchen confidential was a great book about the life of anthony bourdain but most of it was not about the life of chefs. in my opinion it was funny but i think he put to many things that were negative about the culinary business. there are some references about him being addicted to drugs and doing them. and it also had some sexual refferences and sexual things that happened. yes there are some very funny parts in the book that are some funny ideas if you were ever to try them. anthony made a great book but he put to many negative things in it about his life in it that might reflect what people might think secondly about the culinary business.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Well i never was much of a Britney fan until I decided to get this CD, I think I listen to it at least 3 times a day.  U can definetly tell she has grown up a bit, yet she uses no profanity in her songs.  She does imply a lot of sexual thoughts like in her #8 song on CD \\"Touch of a hand\\", but its great because its a mysterious song, you have to really listen to the song to really understand what she's implying.  All around; the beats,rhythms, and different instruments used in this CD are great, its finally kinda original in its own way, not poppy/girlish sounding like rest-like her old cds.  Most of the tracks on this CD are the type you just want to get up and start moving your body in some kinda way cause it just has that effect on you.  I guess ya'll that don't like Britney, keep hating, but maybe explore one of the songs on this cd, be a little more open minded cause thats the only reason i got this cd and i dont regret it, but ya'll that like her-keep grooving- and enjoy the music cause it only gets better as time goes by, Im not a critic but I know my music and this CD deserves a little credit cause this is her best yet!!!
B0001WTUH6|4.0|This is a special \\"Director's Edition\\" of Underworld.  There will be over twelve minutes of additional scenes, as well as eleven minutes of footage swapped out for different angles, cuts, effects and the like for 23 minutes total of never before seen footage.  Most of the features from the original DVD release will be included as well as a new cast commentary, a 45 minute documentary on the history of werewolves and vampires, a blooper reel and a sketchbook of concept art.  A comic book will also be included in the packaging.<br />For super fans of the flick this is a mixed blessing.  LOTR fans are gobbling up both the regular and super editions of their favorite trilogy, but was it  really neccesary to break this set up?  Why not release a two disk, special edition with both versions of the film and all the extras and make that one the definitive edition?<br />I'll probably end up getting this flick just to see the edits and hear the cast commentary.<br />Five stars for the edition and bevy of extras, take one away for the mentality behind a second release.

B000002WU9|5.0|1995 was an excellent year in hip hop. Wu-Tang, Fat Joe, Mobb Deep, Kool G. Rap, 2-Pac, and others DOMINATED. There was no Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz, no Nelly, No Chingy, or any of these wack rappers that dominate hip hop today. In 95, there was REAL hip hop, so real that it'll never be this REAL again. With Wu-Tang already a household name, they went for the kill in 95, and boy did they serve up a CLASSIC. Raekwon and Ghostface Killah teamed up to deliver \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\", one of my all time favorite albums and one of the greatest albums ever released, PERIOD. They were on top of their game and one AWESOME album resulted. Here's the review:<br />Striving For Perfection (an album where even the INTRO is classic, simply put, rae and ghost want the best for themselves and each other)<br />Kunckleheadz (Rae, Ghost, and U-God, a head banging track with hard lyrics for Wu fans)<br />Knowledge God (Rae's solo is a classic and RZA's best is something to behold)<br />Criminology (Rae and Ghost, no, it's not a subject in school, but with this track, you would think that rae and ghost would be the professors)<br />Incarcerated Scarfaces (another Rae solo that's dope as hell)<br />Rainy Dayz (Rae and Ghost, a classic song talking about life's hard times)<br />Guillotine(Swordz) (Rae, Ghost, GZA, Inspektah Deck, everyone spits fire on this track, absolutely thrilling)<br />Can It Be All So Simple (Remix) (Rae and Ghost, it had to be a remix, and boy did they deliver on this one)<br />Shark Niggas (Biters)(on this interlude, they warn you, don't EVER bite the Wu, nuff said)<br />Ice Water(Rae, Ghost, Cappa, the song that introduce the world to Cappadonna)<br />Glaciers Of Ice(Rae, Ghost, Masta Killa, lyrical dars just thrown)<br />Verbal Intercourse(Rae, Ghost, and Nas, an AWESOME spectacle with one of the greatest verses EVER by my favorite MC, Nas)<br />Wisdom Body(ghost, this solo is tight)<br />Spot Rusherz (rae, solo again, listen to rae go Kool G. Rap style onthis one)<br />Ice Cream(rae, ghost, meth, and cappa, who says that the Wu don't like the ladies)<br />Wu Gambinos(rae, ghost, rza, meth, and masta killa, straight bangin, classic Wu here)<br />Heaven & Hell(rae and ghost, what do YOU believe in, heaven or hell)<br />Bonus Track: North Star (Jewelz)(rae's next solo song is the PERFECT way to end an album)<br />Overall, this is ANOTHER MUST HAVE, an album that defined what the Wu sounded like in their prime and the possibly the BEST production that the RZA's ever been responsible for. Cop this NOW if you don't own it. You WILL NOT be disappointed.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|This is the band that has been in COMA since 94, and still is...... this is just like a tiny finger movement from a hand and everybody gets all excited about, thinking that it may wake up. Hope So. I think it the hits could be better without the covers.<BR>including for example: ESTRANGED,DEAD HORSE, USED TO LOVE HER
B000002WPI|5.0|1993 was another tremendous year in hip hop. Snoop Dogg, A Tribe Called Quest, Black Moon, and others dropped gems in 93. But the hip hop world sat up and took notice when the Wu-Tang Clan dropped their first album \\"Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). No other group made such an impact as this group did, ok maybe in line with N.W.A.m, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, just to name a few. But this nine man group had an effective sound NEVER heard in hip hop before, and that's what made them so tight. And what resulted was one of the greatest albums ever. Here's the review:<br />Bring Da Ruckus (RZA, GZA, Inspektah Deck, Ghostface Killah, and Raekwon, what better way to begin an album by challenging ANYONE to bring the ruckus)<br />Shame On A Nigga (ODB, Method Man, Raekwon, tight stuff here)<br />Clan In Da Front (GZA, the genius of the Clan gets to show why he's one of the best members in the group, lyrically)<br />Wu-Tang:7th Chamber (the entire clan, except U-God, everyone shines on this track)<br />Can It Be All So Simple (Raekwon and Ghostface, an introduction to the supreme duo of Rae and Ghost)<br />Da Mystery Of Chessboxin (Inspektah Deck, U-God, Ghostface, Method Man, ODB, Raekwon, and Masta Killa, just awesome and mind blowing at the same time)<br />Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing To F' Wit (RZA, Method Man, and Inspektah Deck, classic Wu-Tang here)<br />C.R.E.A.M. (Raekwon, Method Man, and Inspektah Deck, CLASSIC MATERIAL, one of the greatest songs ever in hip hop and coined the most popular slang term for money)<br />Method Man (Meth goes solo on this one, ripping the mic, setting the seeds for his first album, cememting his position as the most popular and recognized member in the group)<br />Protect Ya Neck (the entire clan except Masta Killa, classic where the group shows what they are like when they are together)<br />Tearz (RZA and Ghostface, great song)<br />Wu-Tang:8th Chamber/Conclusion (they conclude this CLASSIC with a BLAZING remix of the original track)<br />It's a shame that the Wu aren't this catchy now, but in 93 (and up to 98-99), they had their brush with greatness and this classic resulted. Purchase this album NOW if you don't own it.
B000002H7I|5.0|Took sometime without listening to this album, then decided to purchase it again, just to hear more of the magic, and it sounds better everyday. Bridges and Be careful Of my Heart are great tracks...the guiter quality and blend of instruments with Tracy's strong voice makes Damien Rice look like he got his stuff from this album.
B00005JMCT|2.0|O.K first of all, the American Pie Trilogy was no way in line for being the greatest trilogy of all time. But that doesn't disregard the fact that for what the films were, they were good.<BR>They were funny in an uncomfortable way, but then again I'm sure that by now you know that. <BR>This one however was not. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the film but it wasn't very good. The characters that originally made the films watchable in the first place became old hat and stretched. They weren't the same characters anymore.<BR>Also the cinematography was extremely wierd for a comedy.<BR>In the first two the look of the films was easy going and light. This one was dressed up witha lot of colour and styalised shots. None of which is needed in a comedy film.<BR>Anyway, If your one of those people who lives for teen comedy such as this trilogy, Road trip and frankly anything starring Sean William Scott, then unfortunately you generally know nothing about film. Don't worry about it though, much of us fanatics would love to take your place so that we could like more films and criticise less. So if you are one of those people, then you will like this film alot.<BR>However if your not, and you're more than happy to sit down and watch through a huge back catalogue of old films rather than the drivel that Hollywood is constantly spewing up, then you will be dissapointed with this film and it's lack of attention to detail.<BR>You know who you are!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Watch out for this one folks!  I didn't think that I could ever NOT like a Bill Murray movie.  I think Mr. Murray may have been nominated for an Oscar because he is totally &quot;out of character&quot; and &quot;unfunny&quot;.  Let's hope we never have to see the serious side of Bill Murray again.  Scarlett Johansson was beautiful and did a better acting job in &quot;Girl with the Pearl Earring&quot;.  Now we know why movies with NO plot don't work!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Evan Martins -- anyone who reads these reviews can tell that you are a true loser. who do you think you are to be writing about the same album 11 times! - not to mention the horrible reviews you're giving TOT. you obviously are completely brainless + have serious lack of respect for well-made music. i bet if someone met you they would agree that you are unbelievably moronic and obsessive over nothing...  on a better note, Endless Sacrifice is undoubtebly one of the best songs ever made in my opinion. the rest of the album is also amazing. i'm very thankful that my boyfriend introduced me to dream theater - anyone who gives this album or any of dream theater's albums less than 4 stars is not worthy of listening to. for all you know, you could be taking advice from someone who listens to good charlotte, the white stripes, and all the other crap thats out there - the people who dont know what they're talking about. i would reccommend this album to anyone who would take DT's music seriously. its by far worth your money.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Personally I dont know why I watch the show every week when its on  TV but I know that I feel hundred times better once I have seen it. The show gilmore girls have a strange effect on people and you cant help wanting more. who knew that such a simple story could be so much fun. Hope for all our sakes that the rest of the show also comes on DVD in the near future. [...]
B000002H33|5.0|wow...this was an EXTREMELY impressive album! A wonderful display of what Metallica is capable of. My favorite song on this album is Damage Inc. because it is a very upbeat and moving song. I also like The Thing That Should Not Be and Battery. The guitars in the beginning of Battery add a soft and dreamy touch to the slightly heavy song. 5 STARS!
0671027387|5.0|Now, I do not usually read thrillers, but after all the hype about the DaVinci Code, I had to read it.  Once I read that, I HAD to read all Dan Brown's other works.  This was the third I devoured, and I loved it as well, not quite so much as Angels &amp; Demons and DaVinci Code, but very well indeed.<br />I have a great interest in the space program, and while reading this, I kept thinking, &quot;Wouldn't it be awesome if this really happened?&quot;  Then as the book took a typical Dan Brown turn, I reversed that thought to, &quot;Thank God this didn't happen!&quot;<br />The heroine is just the fiesty sort I love to read about, and the plot will, of course, keep you on the edge of your seat.  Interesting concept for a book, with unusual locales, I recommend this to anyone who wants to be absorbed in a book cover to cover.  If you have a busy week planned, put it aside!!  You won't put it down once you start!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|From his rich, great-ranged voice to the ecletic influences in his music, Gavin Degraw has impressed me (and other listeners).  When I first heard the song &quot;Chariot,&quot; I heard it live, and the true test to a good artist/band is not how good their cd is, but how well they play live.  That being the test, Gavin Degraw more than passed (flying colors is an understatement).  I am very impressed with his voice, type of music and performance!
0312263120|4.0|Digital Fortress was a very good read, don't get me wrong, but it was obviously an earlier work of the author's rereleased to capitalize on his DaVinci Code success.  The plot had predictable twists and turns, but was sufficiently interesting and well-conceived.  I did not feel this to be as tautly written as, say, Angels and Demons, but none the less, a good read.  Unlike his other books, I was able to put this one down and get other things done the weekend I was reading it, so I must give this 4 stars rather than 5.  However, if you like Dan Brown's style, I think you will still enjoy this.
B00007LTIC|5.0|Going For The One(1977). Yes's eighth studio album and the return of former Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman.<br />At the dawn of the 70s, Yes was a young band looking for an identity, and they managed to find it through the success of their third album, The Yes Album(1971). They combined the 60s pop rock sensibilities of the Beatles with a strong experimental jazzy prog rock influence and became one of the finest and most innovative prog rock bands to come out of the 70s. Other compeditors like Pink Floyd, Genesis, and Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer were still toying around for a proper sound, and others like Rush and Marillion were years away from starting out, but Yes as well as King Crimson were already well under way to jumpstarting the prog rock movement. They continued to impress new fans and critics alike with timeless classic albums like Fragile(1972) and Close To The Edge(1973). However, the band took on a much more experimental route with the followup releases Tales From Topographic Oceans(1974) and Relayer(1974) which were praised by all the die-hard fans, but were lamented by the critics. Though drummer Bill Bruford and keyboardist Rick Wakeman left around this time, the two albums still served as Yes's creative peak which they would never repeat again.<br />Nearly two and a half years after Relayer, Yes finally unleashes another amazing album, Going For The One. The band decides to forge on ahead with some notable changes, mainly that there are more songs now and they're much shorter than they used to be. Also, Rick Wakeman decided to rejoin because as quoted in the linear notes, he believed that Yes, &quot;...were writing songs again.&quot; Keyboardist Patrick Moraz was booted out of the band due to his over-inflated fame ego. GFTO is to Yes what Permanent Waves later was to Rush: simply a transitional album between periods displaying many qualities of the past while treading onto new territory. Most Yes fanatics have lamented this release because of the shorter lengths of the songs. I say, So what?. Most of the tracks still average around the 5-6 minute mark and there is still a 15-minute epic right at the end, so there's something for everyone. Besides, GFTO showcases some of the best songwriting Yes had ever done. So if more albums were released consisting of nothing but long structures people would start growing tired of them. Yes managed to keep fresh and retain certain qualities which make the band so great. Vocalist Jon Anderson is still at the top of his game, as well as guitarist Steve Howe, bassist Chris Squire, and Alan White on drums. There is really no need for Yes fans to worry here.<br />The album kicks off with the soaring title track, grabbing the listener first with a classic oldies guitar riff, and then letting the other bandmembers joining in to create a catchy rocker. The song works well as a commercial radio single. The band brings the excitement down a bit in the beautifully melodic 'Turn Of The Century', which builds up gradually with accoustic guitars, atmospheric keyboard melodies, and then ending on a powerful note with booming orchestrations and electric guitar melodies. Definitely one of the greatest ballads I've heard in a long time. Next is the steady rocker 'Parallels' which is constantly carried along by a pipe organ melody. Very commercial also, but it never fails to please. Afterwards, the album tones down again with another softer rocker, 'Wondrous Stories'. It harkens back to earlier Yes albums in its sound, and is dominated by accoustic guitar and keyboard overtones. It's actually quite a pleasant and memorable song. The fact that it is my least favorite track on here really tells you how excellent I think this album is. The original album ends on a real high note with the 15-minute epic 'Awaken', starting off with a short piano intro and then gradually becoming more melodic until the pace picks up later on. It's certainly one of the best tracks on the album, and in all of Yes's career.<br />IMO, Rhino Records did an excellent job with the new 2004 remaster series. The album includes a booklet detailing extensive liner notes and many photos of the band during that time. My only gripe here is that Rhino Records decided not to continue the digifold slipcase packaging starting with GFTO. Oh well. Everything else is still there. The remastered album itself is jam-packed with LOT of bonus tracks, filling up the entire disc space and more than doubling the length of the album. You get a few instrumental jam pieces like 'Montreux's Theme' and 'Veyvey (Revisited)' as well as a bonus studio Steve Howe jam of 'Amazing Grace' and several early versions of four of the five studio tracks.<br />Overall, I am very impressed with GFTO and the remastering job, so it gets my full five stars. If I were to say anything bad about the album, it's the fact that the naked man on the album cover has got to go. Honestly, no one wants to see that, but I guess it must've been currently popular. Afterall, Rush did place one on their album Hemispheres around this time and it didn't stop fans from listening and loving the album. GFTO is one of Yes's high points and is essential to any true Yes fan. No Yes collection (or even prog rock collection) is complete without this album. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />Other albums which sound like Going For The One:<BR>-'Tormato' by Yes<BR>-'Fragile' by Yes<BR>-'Permanent Waves' by Rush<BR>-'Hemispheres' by Rush<BR>-'Trilogy' by Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer
B00005V9IK|4.0|I know this movie has gotten mixed reviews, but it is worth watching.  I've seen it many times, &amp; every time it's on cable, I always find myself watching it again.  I do agree with the editorial review about how everything just magically happens in the characters' favor, but *shrug* don't many movies work like that anyway?  The thing that attracted me to it was just the story... the &quot;what if&quot; notion of aliens taking over the planet.  That alone may push some away who don't feel open-minded enough to the possibility...&amp; whether it is or not, it's just a movie.  I myself don't think it's too far-fetched... but, well, I'd have to see it for myself.  So with that in mind, it sort of falls into the fantasy category...with a mix of sci-fi, adventure, &amp; comedy, so with all these genres mixed in, it's fun to watch.<br />As far as the characters, if you liked Will Smith in Men in Black, you'll certainly like him here.  Randy Quaid's character is similar to the one he played in American Pie.... &amp; actually, at times it feels like it IS the same character.  You'll get a good laugh either way.  Jeff Goldblum is pleasing as the genius cable guy who happens to crack the code that no one else noticed... yah, I know.  Goldblum's character's Jewish dad, played by Judd Hirsch, is likable with his memorable wisecracks.<br />Overall, it's not the best movie in the world, but it is entertaining and has many good moments... so there must be some reason cable keeps playing it over &amp; over.  And of course, some of the special effects are really cool.  I didn't see it in the theater, but I'm sure they were even more impressive.  There are some frustrating &amp; aggravating moments (like the virus idea) that many have already pointed out in here, but different things seem to annoy different people, so I'll let you figure it out.  It is also safe enough for a family, esp. if kids are alien fanatics.  If you like movies like this, I'd also suggest Twister, but if you found either of these aggravating, you'd probably find Godzilla even more so.ou found either of these aggravating, you'd probably find Godzilla even more so.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Relayer(1974). Yes's seventh studio album<br />By the time the 1970s rolled around, times were turbulently changing and so was the music. For the most part, 60s pop rock had already declined in favor of hard rock and progressive rock. Yes falls under the latter category. Combining the pop sensibilities of the famed Beatles with a jazzy progressive storytelling influence, Yes took the 70s by storm with several massive albums which are now regarded as classics, such as The Yes Album(1971), Fragile(1972), and Close To The Edge(1973). There were several other bands like Pink Floyd, ELP, and King Crimson who were just getting started by the time Yes had achieved success. CTTE saw Yes experimenting more with long song structures, limiting quantity and focusing on quality of the music. While that album was praised by most, their next foray Tales From Topographic Oceans(1974) which took the experimentation even further, received mixed reviews. In other words, it was good in the eyes of Yes fans but a disaster to the rest of the world. Keyboardist Rick Wakeman even quit the band briefly after the tour because of Yes's musical experiments.<br />Though TFTO didn't fare as well as Yes would have liked, they weren't ready to give up on their exploits yet, so later on that year the bandmembers reached their creative peak with Relayer, Yes's final 3-song concept album. New to the lineup is keyboardist Patrick Moraz, who joined after most of the album was written. Steve Howe was experimenting with a heavier guitar sound, as other bandmembers Jon Anderson(vocals), Chris Squire(bass guitar), and Alan White(drums) were improving on their styles as well. At the time, Relayer didn't have a good reception from the fans a lot like TFTO did, but unlike that album, this one fares MUCH better over time in the context of Yes's discography. TFTO didn't work well because it lacked focus, quality songwriting, and the band was more concentrated on creating a &quot;long story&quot; than actually writing an album. Relayer sees the band in really tight creative cohesion, making memorable free-form music in addition to telling stories. Yes is full of energy here much like on CTTE, and because of that they end up delivering in spades. Here's the album lowdown:<br />Relayer starts off with the massive opener 'Gates Of Delerium', considered by many to be Yes's greatest 20+ minute epic. It shows a lot of variation and is considered to be the heaviest Yes song as well. 'GoD' starts out with lots of guitar and keyboard effects and gradually builds into an orchestrated rocker with many memorable melodies. Towards the halfway mark, the song erupts into a violent clash of guitar and keyboard solos and time change signatures until it reaches a furious peak when lots of crashes can be heard (created by leftover car parts hung on a rack and bashed, according to the liner notes). It's supposed to represent a &quot;battle&quot;, and eventually as the excitement hits the zenith, it calms down gently into a melodic haze of atmospheric keyboards. The last seven minutes or so of the song consist of a balladic section called 'Soon', which served as the album's single. Overall, this is certainly one of the best and most epic songs I've heard from any band, and is worth the price of the disc alone. Next is the cool outer spacey jam 'Sound Chaser', which shows the band at their all-time best instrumentally. There is plenty of jazzy prog stuff going on throughout the course of the song. The more frantic sections of it are similar to the style that the band Rush would be playing in the later 70s and 80s. I'm surprised that most fans don't like this track, but I find it to be quite entertaining and it's one of my favorite Yes songs. It did managed to sit in their live setlist for many years. The original album closes with the optimistic ballad 'To Be Over'. It's a pretty decent song and the band themselves seem to love it, but I find myself listening to the other two tracks far more often. It does serve as a good way of closing the album though, and I'm sure it can grow on fans over time.<br />If one important thing is to be said, it's that Rhino Records did an outstanding job on remastering the album and including extras. Roger Dean sported some excellent artwork on the front and back covers. Relayer comes in a digifold slipcase, with the full album art, and a booklet with many band photos and extensive liner notes detailing the time period around this album. They sure don't skimp out on the extras either as the album itself contains three extra tracks, consisting of single-release versions of 'Soon' and 'Sound Chaser' as well as an early demo of the full 'Gates Of Delerium.' Plus the remastering job itself really brings Relayer's sound to the full, so most all Yes fans (new and old alike) will appreciate the entire package.<br />So is Relayer worth the purchase? You bet! Though I probably wouldn't start here if you are new to Yes. I would recommend checking out Fragile, CTTE, and the next album Going For The One(1977) first before moving on to the masterpiece Relayer. It gets 5 stars for the album itself and the remastering job. Relayer is a rare album which transcends its time and greatly rewards repeated listens. It shows Yes mastering the prog epic format before condensing their material afterwards. Though it wasn't popular at the time, most Yes fans consider Relayer to be a true classic and is essential to any Yes collection. Afterall, it's my favorite of theirs. Plus, upon listening to this, you can see why Geddy Lee (of Rush) onced picked this as a perfect desert island disc. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR FANS AFTER PURCHASING THE AFORMENTIONED ALBUMS.<br />Other releases that sound like Relayer:<BR>-'Close To The Edge' by Yes<BR>-'Fragile' by Yes<BR>-'Hemispheres' by Rush<BR>-'Trilogy' by ELP
B00015YVDG|2.0|\\"Ransom\\" is the taut thriller about a man's desperation to get back his kidnapped son. Instead of paying the ransom, Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) decides to play a deadly game of cat and mouse with his son's kidnappers. He publically offers a million dollar reward to the person who can apprehend his son's attackers - either dead or alive. Gary Sinise, Rene Russo and Brawley Nolte (yes, Nick Nolte's son)all offer stellar performances that make this high stakes drama intense visual pleasure for the cinematic thrill seeker.<BR>TRANSFER: Unfortunately no one at Touchstone seems to agree. There can be no other reason for offering \\"Ransom\\" in the identical, tired, poorly rendered, NON-ANAMORPHIC transfer that was previously available. The open credit sequence is riddled with \\"age\\" related nicks, chips and scratches (how old is this film?!?!). The color palette is betrayed with muddy, inconsistent hues and an overly low contrast level that even in a completely blackened room is hard on the eyes. Aliasing, edge enhancement and pixelization - as before - are obvious on this transfer as well as more than a passable amount of film grain. The audio is STEREO - not 5.1!!! <BR>EXTRAS: An engaging commentary by director Ron Howard, four deleted scenes, a ridiculous but new making-of featurette and a thoroughly useless \\"Between Takes\\" featurette. Also, the internationl trailer (gee, thanks!).<BR>BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
0385336810|5.0|This is the greatest \\"chick lit\\" author of all time, and this might just be her best book. Can You Keep a Secret? is the story of Emma, a girl who is just like you and me. She has dreams, frustrations, a funny family, awful co-workers- everything we can relate to. She also has an amazing ability get herself into hilarious messes. The book opens with one such mess. During a very turbulent and frightening airplane ride, she tells a total stranger all of her deepest and most embarrassing secrets. However, the airplane does not crash, and that is not the last she sees of this handsome stranger.... This book will have you laughing out loud. It is a very enjoyable story.<br />I am a big Sohpie Kinsella fan, so I have so be honest, I mail ordered this book last year from England. (The author is from England, so this book has been out for sale there for a while) I enjoyed it so much and I shared it with all of my friends. It was a big hit. Everyone who reads it loves it. I guarantee this book is a \\"5 star\\" book!!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I was soooo looking forward to seeing this movie! I was. Reloaded wasn't what I had hoped it to be, but it was OK, I guess. I gave it a 6 out of 10 stars (my own personal scale). I was hoping the Brothers would redeem themselves with Revolutions. \\"The Matrix: Revolutions\\" was absolutly the single WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life! There was NO PLOT, nothing from the first two movies are resolved, no questions are answered. I personally gave it (and I'm a HUGE Matrix I fan mind you.) 1 out of 10 stars. Nothing more I can say about it. I'm going to forget about II and III, should have never of been made. Either of em.
0679428895|4.0|The world's only superpower, an abundance of advanced technology, rich people who cheat on their taxes, corrupt functionaries, a huge gulf between the have's and the have-not's.  All of this plus an event so horrendous no one could ever have imagined it.  How very much Rome, AD 79, resembles a certain other place we all know.  This sense that the world Robert Harris creates in \\"Pompeii\\" is at once alien (when was the last time you feasted on flamingo tongues?) while at the same time familiar is a part of the appeal of this book.<br />\\"Pompeii\\" concerns an aquarius (an engineer in ancient Rome who specializes in aqueducts) who has just taken over responsibility for the aqueduct that supplies a quarter of a million people in towns around the Bay of Naples.  His predecessor has mysteriously disappeared, and he is noticing some very funny goings-on in the functioning of his aqueduct.<br />I loved Harris's descriptions of Roman hydraulic engineering, his blow-by-blow account of the eruption, and the scenes in which Pliny the Elder - scholar, commander of the Roman navy, and eyewitness to the big event of  AD 79 - is present.  The book has been painstakingly researched, as the acknowledgements attest.  However, I thought that the book dragged a bit in the middle, and that the love story could have been given a bit more substance.  But I put that aside when I came to the book's last memorable chapters.  The last sentence of this book is one of the best book-last-sentences I have ever read.  But it won't mean anything to you until you've had the pleasure of reading this fine work, which I highly recommend.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|This CD is awesome.<br />The original disc is incredibly cool, with ten of my all-time favorite songs on it.  \\"My Name is Jonas\\" is a cool \\"geek rawk\\" song, and so are the rest of 'em.<br />The B-Sides are really good, too.  They rock just about as much as the originals.  Also, its pretty cool to hear the demos of the songs we all know and love.<br />The first CD I got on the first day it existed is one of my favorites.<br />GEEKS FOREVER!!!

0671027344|2.0|This book makes me think I could write a teeny bopper anthem.  It makes it look that easy.  Just recall my early high school days and exaggerate a little.  Social trouble since I wasn't in a clique... lets make that social outcast that no one will talk to... ever.  And on top of that, lets make that bother me a lot, and I will be an emotional sissy as well.  Charlie really didn't seem very schooled in the art of being a wall flower.  Yeah, I understand the death of his aunt and other childhood experiences shook him up.  But he was still way too emotional.  Too extreme for a character people seem to relate to so well (maybe I was just boring?).  Meh, I'll move on.<br />This book is basically the journal of a social idiot.  I don't see how anyone could act as poorly around people as the kid in this book does.  More than anything, this book made me laugh, because the people the main character was calling his friends seemed to do little more than drug him up so they would have something to laugh at.  It was kind of sad, but he put himself in all of these situations.  I enjoyed reading it, but not because it was &quot;eye openning&quot; or &quot;inspirational&quot; like I had heard from numerous sources, but because I found it hilarious how naive this kid was.  It is like a really bad, really stupid version of Catcher in the rye.  I would classify it as utter crap if not for the last 15 pages or so, when it actually delivered a message.  But this message is nowhere near ground breaking.  Maybe that is just because I am 19 and have had time to figure out the topics it hit for myself.  But when I was talking to a couple of friends that had read it, and reading reviews of it, this book was being hailed as a classic.  People were calling it their favorite book ever.  I just don't see where you can get that.  You go through 190 pages of a kid going through unrealistic emotional swings, around people who bury themselves and then whine about it.  And then you get 15 pages that are kind of interesting.  And that just doesn't make a classic for me.  Maybe I am missing something, but I am pretty confident in my reading comprehension skills.  It just gets really old reading other people portray this time of life, and then others praising their work as genious.are kind of interesting.  And that just doesn't make a classic for me.

B00005JLEX|5.0|Hey Seinfeld lovers. I have great news straight from the horses mouth.

And not delete it from this site. this is great, I have seen every episode of Seinfeld 100 times and it is still funny everytime I see it. So I hope this is some informative news and just as exciting for all of you as it was for me. Thank you Sony pictures. !!!!!!!!!
B00007FOMP|5.0|How does one write words about this wonderful album that can speak to our heart and our soul? Love one's fellow man and remember to express your love to God too. Wow. Mr. Gaye was writing at a time of very great social unrest in the USA. MLK &amp; RFK were dead and people were very, very distressed about the Vietnam war. He spoke of basic love. Now we listen to him as if he is the Walt Whitman of R&amp;B music. And he is. Beautiful sound. Inspiring lyrics. Makes you want to hug your mom, dad, your children and....see your neighbor as your equal and your responsibility to care for. It doesn't get any better than that.
0385504209|5.0|This book masterfully combined all of my favorite themes  - history, secret societies and ACTION!  I tore through the pages more engrossed than I had ever thought possible. The obscure connections through history and geography fit together ingeniuosly.  Very impressive.
B00003CX8N|2.0|I've given this charming movie 2 stars because of the treatment it got on DVD.  The movie itself deserves 5 stars.<br />Columbia Tri-Star did a real disservice by releasing this movie in pan and scan mode and not in the format as it was shown in  theaters.  If you remember at the very beginning of the DVD the words \\"This movie has been reformatted to fit your television\\".  So in reality, you viewing a heavily cropped out movie.<br />I won't give a descriptive review of the movie as others have done so quite eloquently here.<br />A quiet and magical movie that deserved far better treatment on DVD.  Shame on Columbia Tri-Star.
0156027321|5.0|Reading this book became more than the simple act of reading.  As with truly intelligent writing, for days after the last page was turned, I was left thinking of the magnitude of this tale and all that it implied.  When I first heard of the premise, I wondered how it would possibly work, but then, sea voyages are nothing new to literature.  Moby Dick, The Old Man and The Sea, and of course Kon Tiki all took place over long periods at sea.  Life of Pi contains elements of those aforementioned master works, but maintains its own special dignity by adding spiritual lessons to this unique genre.<br />There are many in the world today who could learn from the intelligent look at the innocence of a child who becomes entranced with the Muslim faith, Christianity, and Hinduism. It is through the varied faiths that he has that Pi is able to survive his ordeal.<br />This book is simply astonishing and I recommend it highly.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I am not ashamed to admit that I don't like hip hop/rap music. In my opinion, the whole hip hop/rap genre has gotten tiresome and predictable. It has gotten into a stagnate like rock music has. Other than Outkast, the only hip hop/rap group that I honestly respect and like is Black Eyed Peas. I just got into them recently thanks to new BEP member Fergie (Sarah Ferguson from the old kids show \\"Kids Inc.\\") and the ultra catchy \\"Where is the Love?\\". I just love the addition of Fergie's vocals as well as the lyrics (as cheesy they might be for some people). I just received my copy of \\"Elephunk\\" today. I immediately loved the cd. It is very catchy melody-wise and very reggae-influenced. The beats were tight. I liked the fact that there was more of a world-influence on the music than the predictable slick sample from some '70s soul/funk song. It gets really tiresome listening to a some old soul/funk/rock song get regurgitated (i.e see that talent-challenged P.Diddy). I thought the marriage of Will.I.Am, taboo, and apl.de.ap's raps with Fergie's smooth vocals was a match made in heaven. I love all the songs on this album but I will always have a soft spot for the refreshingly positive track \\"Where is the Love?\\". \\"Sexy\\" is another personal track of mine because of the lovely piano melodies which reminded me of Henry Mancini believe it or not. \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"Lets Get Retarded\\" are other favorites with their humorous lyrics. \\"Elephunk\\" is certainly going to be a great cd to listen to over this summer. It just has a great vibe that is perfect tto listen to while hanging out with your friends at the beach.
0375713751|5.0|I finished this poignant tale today and am reeling at just how good it was.  Set in modern day London, the main haracter Kate is trying her hand at being Super Woman, but as she and some of the rest of us have figured out, there is no way that we can do it all.  Every woman who has tried in vain to master being the perfect mother, home keeper, career woman and of course, wife will relate to this remarkably well crafted story.<br />Although the book is unique in its own right, there are traces of Bridget Jones at the end of each chapter where Kate goes through her Must Remember list.  Pearson did such a masterful job in defining all of her characters down to the smallest detail, that it became hard for me to even like the over-achieving Kate until halfway through the book.  Then, as the history of her own childhood became clear, the pieces came together deftly and I realized why she was trying so hard.   <br />The fierce and starving heroine Scarlett O'Hara once said, \\"As God as my witness, I will never go hungry again.\\"  Kate never wanted to be poor again, and at great cost she finally realizes that having money isn't the only wealth we need to have a happy home.
1563898586|5.0|This 'graphic novel' by Alan Moore is filled with fascinating characters, literary references, and very dry humor.  It's a hundred times smarter than the movie that came out last summer under the same title.<br />This tells the story of five famous characters from Victorian literature who join forces in a 'league of extraordinary gentlemen' to save the world. Allan Quatermain from 'King Solomon's Mines', Mina Murray from 'Dracula', Dr. Jekyll and his Hyde counterpart, the invisible man and Captain Nemo from '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' come together, bantering over cups of tea(...).<br />The graphic element of this graphic novel is absolutely stunning.  The artist O'Neill assembles crowded street scenes in Paris and London with a few quick strokes of his brush, and lovingly creates detailed images of the macabre and sometimes perverse world Moore has created in words.  Take a look at the all girls 'school' the characters visit while recruiting the invisible man.  Whew.<br />The action is fast paced, the dialogue is biting and believable, and the characters are great fun.  Overall, a good, smart story.(...)Enjoy.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Everything after Vogue and Express Yourself has been mediocre to positively dull and monotonous.  She'll always be a STAR, but it doesn't mean that everything she records is good.
0783228570|5.0|First is the rather annoying operatic feel of the movie , everything is grandiose and over the top . Every set is massive as the camera pans out showing us the sets . People don`t just take a line of cocaine , they fall face down in a massive mound of the drug . <br />The second flaw is Tony Montana`s motivation . He cares about children deeply ( It`s this that leads to his downfall ) but nothing in Oliver Stone`s script explains why he`s so caring about little ones . It`s an obvious redemption plot . He cares . End . No explanation . It`s never really explained either why Tony wants to keep his sister away from all men<br />SCARFACE does have some really good points . I never once thought I was watching Pacino act because Pacino IS Montana and all the other performances are good . Despite the flaws of the script the dialogue is highly quotable with lines like &quot; I bet you aint been f***ed all year &quot; and &quot; Say hello to my little friend &quot; . A shame the gut wrenching violence is too overblown to be credible or disturbing .
0060987464|5.0|This book was a fascinating and definitely worthwhile look into the eyes of America's monster, Mr. Brian Warner.  It took me only a day to read, because I could not put it down, and I am in the course of reading it a 3rd time now.  Brian, or as you most know him by, Marilyn Manson, had one messed up childhood, and it really makes you see exactly why he puts a lot of his messages in music.  He even explains a lot of personal things about his album AntiChrist Superstar that most people never knew, and for me, that makes the album all the better and in depth.  Its packed with dozens of photos and even some drawings by Manson himself, and it has 14 full color pages of Manson pictures in the middle if you just cant get enough of him.  Some highlights of the book are Manson getting kidnapped by Trent Reznor of NIN, Manson's `rules' about drugs, cheating, and homosexuality, pages of affidavits regarding the horrible things that supposedly happened at his concerts (but of course didn't)stories and poems Manson sent into a magazine to be published, and an explination of that whispering noise at the beginning of the song `tourniquet.'  The only problem I had with this book is it didn't seem personal enough.  It was based more factually than it was emotionally for Manson, which is something I wasn't hoping for, seeing as how we all know he always has something intelligent or artistic to say about the world.  But little does he go into his theories or his views throughout the book.  And i wish he would have written this book later, so he could have talked about the things that happened after he wrote this, such as his album Mechanical Animals or Holy Wood.<BR>But still, its fantastic.
B0000A118M|5.0|The negative reviews are from people with poor taste and poor ears. As for the review in 'trying-to-write-Ebonics' -titled \\"What's the hype, dog?\\" by some idiot from Garden City, MI United States - white guys fronting as black guys is very easily discerned by the knowing. Know that, playa-hatin' white boy!     Now - to the album. This is very pure music that comes undiluted from the soul of a highly evolved and empathetic human being - who knows the depths and ecstasies of the human soul - and who has the genius to express every shade of his gigantic wisdom and understanding.     You don't need to look up a jazz encyclopaedia and throw words around to understand this - people who do that are usually trying to show off because they lack soul.     A healer plays these sounds - a medicine man. Coltrane is truly a Bodhisattva.
B00009Z574|4.0|I, too, have experienced the skipping error on Track 18.  Between my friend and I, we have cracked and returned 5 copies, and from different shipments (all US pressings) and the defects vary, depending on the player used.  I had a friend in Britain also check a German pressing out for me, and it also skipped at various places on the track.  I understand that some people either don't have the defect or don't notice it (how can they not?) but in any case, it is too widespread, which points to a mastering problem.  Buyer beware!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I have seen the Greendale show five times, and was blown away each time!!!  The album is a perfect look at a slice of today's life.  Neil is such a great story teller, and his current story about a &quot;normal&quot; town in America nails it!  People had mixed reviews about Greendale, both live and on the CD, but that is just because people fight change!  So many people in music have been afraid to speak about the nation's current issues, and Neil had the courage to tell it like it is!  I am greatful that this sort of emotion still exists in music.  When Neil performs live, and get's lost telling a story, I hang on every word!!!  I don't understand one of the reviews on this page that mentions Neil playing at The Meadowlands.  Greendale did not play there!  His website has all the songs and lyrics if you need to see before you buy.  It may not be for everyone, but it is perfect for me!!!!!<br />&quot;sun green started makin' waves<br />on the day her grandpa died<br />speakin' out against anything<br />unjust or packed with lies&quot;<br />sun green leaned into that megaphone<br />and said, &quot;truth is all i seek&quot;<br />security brought in some blowtorches<br />news cameras recorded the speech<br />&quot;when the city is plunged into darkness<br />by an unpredicted rolling blackout<br />the white house always blames the governor,<br />sayin', 'the solution is to vote him out'&quot;<br />Be the Rain!
0385510438|1.0|Grisham is off on another political tirade. He starts off developing a decent plot and then abandons it.  He gets off on an anti-Vietnam crusade extolling the virtues of running off to Canada.  He focuses on his relationship with a matriarch which, again, diverts from the story line. He treats the solving of final crimes as an afterthought.  Grisham has clearly lost it.  Where he once wove a tale that meshed from beginning to end, he now appears on an ego trip to stuff his political predjuces down the readers throat at the expense of whatever plot he initiated.  I was also disappointed with The King Of Torts for many of the same reasons. This was the last book by him that I shall read.
B00012QM86|5.0|To lulubee56 for saying: &quot;and what were the jewish people thinking they had time to do something too. There was enough of them to fight back.&quot; How can people be so ignorant? Yeah, it must be easy for you to imagine yourself in their shoes, right? You can't even begin to conceive of what it felt like. It's an emotion Spielberg admirably touches upon, but even he can't portray this emotion on film--it's humanly impossible. Aside from that rude (to say the least) comment, I'd like to mention that this is a wonderful film. It evokes emotions rarely achievable in film. Spielberd did a spectacular job.
B00018D3RI|5.0|The best  cop show of the '70's is back with a vengeance. I remember this show when I watched it as a teenager. Thought it was cool then, and still think it's cool now. You can thank Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul for that. These guys made the show what it is. And that ultra cool Lalo Schifrin score is baad. My only two minor complaints are that I wish they remastered the sound in dts or 5.1 instead of mono, and the episodes from the master prints- a few look a little fuzzy and scratchy. But besides that,  the dvd set is great. We've waited a long time for this. Bring on season 2!!

B00008EY9G|4.0|To begin with, this movie has a great cast!  The story line is very unique and not your typical thriller movie plot. I also thought the end of the movie was very unpredictable! Just when you think it's over, something new happens. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the thriller/horror genre!
B0001JXQEM|5.0|I picked this up today, and I must say that I am pleased.  Even though just about all of these songs have been released, it's nice to have the b-sides and demos officially released on one disc.  And there are three new tracks -- \\"Lullabye for Wayne,\\" \\"I Swear It's True,\\" and an old demo version of \\"Undone - The Sweater Song.\\"<br />For the casual fan, hearing these old demos really gives you an idea of what Weezer sounded like when they were still a garage band.  They definitely had a more raw, edgy sound.  For hardcore fans, this is worth it just for the new tracks, especially \\"Lullabye for Wayne.\\"  Also, the new pictures and liner notes are nice to have.<br />Make sure to also pick up Weezer's new DVD, Video Capture Device.<br />Have a good day,<BR>  J.L.

0792838084|5.0|BLUE VELVET, at its core, states a simple case: all things that appear good are only good in appearance; all things evil are evil through and through. You start with the over-Kodachromed shots of Anytown, USA, with its wildflowers, fire engines, and spotless sidewalks. You conclude with a chirping robin which is a puppet, and David Lynch makes no attempt to make it seem like it's anything but a puppet. In between these elements is evil: a severed ear, shootings, bloodied and battered people, and Frank Booth. This dark world seems much more real than the sunlit Anytown, and this is David Lynch's starting point.<br />BLUE VELVET is going to be unwatchable for many people: it's violent, it's graphic, it's &quot;weird&quot;, etc. But if you get beyond some of the stylization, you will find this film to be a powerful indictment of American society gone mad. And as far as movie-making goes, this movie is a magnet for the eyes. This is a visual dans-macabre: stark settings and brash lighting amid the darkness; the contrasting colors; the sweeping camera movements just keep your eyes glued to the screen. Combine this with the brilliant performances of Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, and, of course, Dennis Hopper, and you'll find out why this film endures, even as it nears its third decade.<br />If you don't get this film, you will get a love letter from me. And you don't want a love letter from me. Do you know what a love letter from me is?

B0001ADAVK|1.0|This is yet another example of Hollywood's liberal attacks on America's most popular decade. There are books written about teenagers that portray all of them as rebels that were out to destroy their parents. As a teenager (actually I was in my early 20s; I was born in 1935) in the 1950s, I came across NO ONE who had these feelings at all both in high school and college. Neither did my teenaged sisters. ANYWAY, let's look at this  film:<br />Set at supposedly idealistic Wellesley College in Massachusetts (said to be the most conservative woman's girls school) just after Eisenhower's election (America's best time period was from when Eisenhower was elected in 1952 to when Sputnik went up in October 1957), these young ladies continue to be traditional. Then this radical from Berkeley (naturally) comes and encourages them to not be traditional. Soon, the girls turn to lesbianism and sleep with all the male professors. This is vicious because it is portraying all men in the 50s as being cheaters (thanks to the Kinsey report) and all women are lesbians. Marriage is wrong. It enslaves women because women should be free and live together, not vow to love, honor and obey. This is the message this show presents. <br />Marriage is something that is no joke. I remember the old Frank Sinatra song: &quot;love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage since you can't have one without the other.&quot; I married my college sweetheart in 1958 and we were happily married and raised two sons until she tragically drowned ala Natalie Wood in 1982. I remarried in 1992. So steer clear of works like this and instead look at real 1950s films made by Douglas Sirk, Joshua Logan, Nicholas Ray, Billy Wilder, etc. I think you'll find those more interesting and enlightening.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is truely one of the best cds I have ever listened to.  One of my favorite songs \\"Where I End and You begin\\" is on this cd.  That song is just incredible and everyone should listen to it at least once.  Other great songs are 2=2=5 and Sit down, Stand Up.  Some people might have different thoughts about this cd than me, but I know rock music and this is surely a great Radiohead album and a great rock album.
0486282147|5.0|The Hound of the Baskervilles is a true mystery classic by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It tells of Sherlock Holmes and his trusty comrade, Dr. John Watson. This extraordinary pair has solved dozens of mysteries times before, but now come to their most difficult case. Years ago, Hugo Baskerville was killed by a monstrous hound. This curse of the hound has haunted all the Baskervilles who come to live at the Baskerville Hall. Sir Charles goes to live there, but soon is found dead, scared to death. His only relative, Sir Henry Baskerville, goes to live at Baskerville Hall accompanied by Holmes and Watson. All along the way, they are left mysterious clues that eventually help them unlock the killer. I really liked this classic who-dun-it because around every corner was a twist. It kept you guessing until the end and was really upbeat
0783225725|5.0|This gives the old saying, \\"painting the town red,\\" a whole new meaning.<br />Eastwood is portraying a gunman wreaking vengeance on an entire Western town for standing by while a gang of nasties brutally kills the sheriff.  One gets the impression, at the end, that he is the reincarnation of the murdered sheriff, himself.<br />This is, in no way, intended as a criticism: Eastwood, like John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable and a host of other fine actors, always plays himself.

0060934719|5.0|Okay, maybe not the kind of Fairy Tale you would read to your very young children, but after delving through horror and dark fantasy, I found Stardust to be a refreshing, childlike break; minus the hangover of feeling like I was exposed to an excess of sugar and cotton candy.  After all, Fairy tales used to be a bit brutal in their own right, and taking away all of the blood and violence in order to conform to today's &quot;Politically Correct&quot; standards also takes away from the lesson to be learned.  IMHO.<br />This tale is told with a simple exuberance, yet manages to hold up under the scrutiny of all us die hard Neil Gaiman fans, showing us that he has the talent to lead us along gentler slopes of the same deadly peaks and chasms he has taken us to in his other works.  His playfulness shows through in Stardust as a novel, the way his chapbooks \\"Wolves In The Walls\\" and \\"The Day I Swapped My Dad For 2 Goldfish\\" did with his graphic novels.<br />Tristin Thorn lives in the English town of Wall, right next to, well, the Wall.  There is only one way through the Wall, a gap which is constantly guarded by the village folk of Wall; not to keep people from coming in, but to keep the inhabitants of Wall from crossing over into the land of Faerie.  Once every nine years there is a huge fair within the field beyond the gap, and only then do the peoples from each of the lands mingle.  Tristin is not aware that half of his lineage is from across the Wall, and when the day comes that he watches a falling star with the girl he wishes to marry, and promises to bring her back that very same star, his father Dunstan helps him to cross the gap into Faerie.<br />Over in Faerie, it is time for the Lord of Stormhold to die, and pass along his Reign to one of his sons.  Unable to determine which of his surviving sons is worthy, the old Lord tosses the Power of Stormhold (a topaz set in an amulet) up into the air and tells his sons that whoever finds the amulet will rule after him.  This won't be easy for the offspring of the old Lord, for already four of his seven sons were dead, killed off by the living brothers in order to eliminate their claim to Stormhold.<br />Also in Faerie live the Lilim, three ancient women who have lived on and on for forever, revitalizing their youth by eating the hearts from fallen stars.  When the star falls, one of the ancient crones makes herself young again and sets out after the star.<br />Tristin is helped along in his quest by some, and treated rudely by others, but always manages to get along by determination and, surprisingly, innocence.  When he is transported by a magic candle to where the star had fallen, he is shocked to see that the Fallen Star is a girl, and she has a broken leg to boot.<br />The adventures of Tristin in his journey back to The Wall and the market within the field are magical, fantastical, and sometimes just a tiny bit scary.  Though the plot really does have a transparent ending, it still does not take away from the total enjoyment of Tristin's adventures and the predicaments he falls in and out of.  All of the main characters coalesce in the ending, but the side characters we meet along the way are just as fleshed out and real to me as Tristin, Yvaine the Star, and Madame Semele with her mysterious bird.<br />Go ahead and step through the Gap with Tristin, you won't be sorry you tagged along.

0385336810|5.0|I admit it.  I am a major fan of Sophie Kinsella and all three of her Shopaholic books.  I was so anxious to read her new  book that I ordered it from Amazon(...) the day it was released there.  I LOVED it.  This is her best book since the first Shopaholic book. I could not put it down.<br />Just like Shopaholic, the main character is awesome and funny and you care about her and want to root for her right away.  <br />I love Miss Kinsella's style of writing.  The heroine's dialogue just draws you into the story.  Just like Becky from the Shopaholic stories, Emma just gets into one hysterically funny situation after another and I had to keep reading to see what would happen next.   <br />There are some similarities between this book and the Shopaholic books particularly since  both leads are somewhat neurotic English females and the books are all done in first person, but the situations are totally different and even though Shopaholic books were great and I and hated to see them end, I loved Emma and her story on its own merits.<BR> <BR>Two suggestions:  Do not start this book late at night because then you will be up all night reading this page turner.  Also, do not read it anyplace where you will be embarassed by laughing out loud.
B0001CNRS4|3.0|This movie is not worth $18. It's not even worth the $8 to see it in the theater. It's that type of movie that's awesome to watch if you have time and a bit of money to waste... to go rent it or even on pay-perview. It's a heart-warming movie and a real tear-jerker. But why is the movie called Honey? Her co-stars and the other characters overpower her. The little children are so cute and so adorable they steal the screen. The movie is more about the children getting off the streets and doing something than it is about Honey finding her career. So if your just watchin it to see Jessica Alba shake her butt, then your wasting your money.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Most people write this album off as &quot;U2 trying to be a techno band.&quot; This is a stupid statement, and if people saw beyond the marketing image of the album and listened to the actual music, they would realise that there is only one song that would really be called techno; track #3, &quot;Mofo&quot;, and through the rest of the album it is really just rock with some electronic overlays for effect. Immediately after &quot;Discoteque&quot; and &quot;Mofo&quot;, &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot; makes thing undeniably 'rock' and no one in their right mind would call it techno. Then it moves on to &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot;, which is a new spin on their former more folk oriented style, and then as the album progresses it becomes gradually darker and more downbeat, from the agressive &quot;Miami&quot; to the melancholy &quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress&quot; and the forlorn &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;.<br />U2 had allready been using electronic elements in their music for years before &quot;Pop&quot;, with albums like &quot;Zooropa&quot; and &quot;Actung Baby&quot;. Producers like Flood and Brian Eno had helped them use these elements to give the music a more dramatic and intense edge, and in my opinion, it was really evolving U2's music and took it beyond the level of the feel good, folky, arena rock pop songs U2 became famous for in the late 80's, to make something more emotional and complex. This improvement really showed in Achtung Baby, and in Pop they pushed it further and created what I think is the album with the most emotional range and dramatic punch of U2's career.<br />Unfortunately they decided to slap this &quot;pop&quot; &quot;techno&quot; &quot;discotec&quot; label and look on it, and suddenly everyone wrote U2 off as &quot;selling out&quot; when in reality fan favorites like The Joshua Tree were much more &quot;pop&quot; oriented. The whole &quot;pop&quot; image was probably meant as a sort of  sarcastic parody of U2's own sucess, but the joke went right over the public's head and they suddenly saw U2 as &quot;technopop eurotrash&quot;.<br />Now, as a result, we have &quot;All that you Can't Leave Behind&quot; in which U2 recoils from the bad reception of &quot;Pop&quot; by merely rehashing the folky arena rock style that made them famous instead of actually trying to do something new and different. However, perceptive listeners with an open mind can be treated to one of the hidden gems of the popular music industry, and enjoy what is perhaps U2's best work. Give it a chance and you might like it...a lot.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Someone compared this movie's last scene to a lyric in a pop song, and not kindly, because it is elusive and allusive enough that the viewer/listener has to fill in the gaps. Do you know what they call spare writing where the reader has to fill in the gaps? They call it poetry. I wonder how many who dislike &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; actually like poetry of any kind.<br />In just a few short lines a poem can move you as powerfully as any novel. The most small-scale work of art, perfectly honed can penetrate deeply. But you do have to make an effort yourself to fill in the spaces. <br />&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is beautiful for the same reason a haiku by Bashu is beautiful. And has a similar mood.<br />The year's first day<BR>thoughts and loneliness;<BR>the autumn dusk is here.
0790751305|5.0|Eastwood has turned in a good Western here, even though the theme is anti-Western, and he plays an anti-hero.<br /><br />The plot is well covered by other reviewers.  A ... is attacked and disfigured by a couple of local cowhands, and the madam and her girls raise a bounty and hire Munny (Eastwood) and his sidekicks to kill them.  And, they do.<br /><br />That's the gist of it.  The movie is earthy.  The bad guy, for example, is killed while using the outhouse.  An undignified end, which is exactly what he deserves.<br /><br />No heroism here.  No shining knight on a white charger.  Instead, you get the feeling of realism, which is what director Eastwood was certainly after.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance
B000000I3O|5.0|this is the best collection of Danzig-era misfits material.  This is a great starting place for anyone interested, in fact static age might be better, as long as you don't get american psycho or famous monsters first.  It was Danzig's band after all.
B00005JMKI|4.0|It is not surprising to me that this movie got a limited release and has yet to be made available on DVD in America. It is available through amazon.co.uk.  Lars von Trier paints an even more biting view of small town life in America, than he did in Dancer in the Dark.  This time, he works with Nicole Kidman and once again proves he can draw more out of a mediocre actress than any other director.  This is unquestionably Kidman's best performance to date, but even here she is upstaged by a fine acting ensemble that includes some old favorites like Lauren Bacall and Ben Gazarra.  But what struck me the most about this film was the way in which Von Trier staged it, making this is into a theatrical production and relying on a relative handful of props to project his image of Dogville.<br />The movie builds in the same way a Shirley Jackson novel does, slowly, inexorably to its shattering conclusion.  The fact that Von Trier relies so heavily on narration does not detract from the film, but instead gives it an even more ominous air.  Grace finds what at first appears to be safe harbor in Dogville, only to learn that the people are not what they seem.  The town is essentially a collection of castouts, who have created a marginal existence for themselves in what appears to be a coal mining district in West Virginia.  Von Trier holds the suspense very well, and the ending will catch most viewers by surprise.
0739313126|1.0|I admit I read this book because of all the hype.  I am in total disbelief that something like this has accumulated so much positive acclaim.  This book is badly researched, has ridiculous omissions and the supposed expert characters are made to look like ridiclous buffoons repeatedly.  Did all these people that rave about it miss that?  The thing that bothers me the most is the constant references to this bad piece of bad researched pulp as genius.  I will never cease to be amazed by the bad tastes and obvious bad education of the general public.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is one of the best books I have ever read. It is filled with life's lessons and quotes that will remain with you long after the end of the book. It is about a man who is dying named Morrie and the relationship with one of his students, Mitch. Instead of dying a defeated and lonely man because of the life he has chosen to live, he dies happily and surrounded by those that he loves. Until his last breath he continues to teach Mitch lessons that will last a lifetime. &quot;When you learn how to die, you learn how to live&quot; was one of my favorite quotes that Morrie shared with us. This book is fabulous and will give you a whole new outlook on life. We should all hope to be half as selfless as Morrie was. If I achieve on tenth of what Morrie did my life's goal will be accomplished and my life will be complete.
B000094J5W|5.0|Mitch, Beanie, and Frank are three guys reclaiming the good ole days before they settled into marriage, long-term relationships and careers.  In the beginning of the movie, Mitch comes home and finds that his girlfriend Heidi is into ganbanging.  Frank gets married but finds that he can't stay married because he feels that he is losing himself and goes out of control at the Mitchapalooza party.  Beanie is married with children and is doing what he can to help his friend Mitch get out of his funk.  They form a fraternity with some of the guys that are considered not popular enough.  Then in comes the dean who can't stand the sight of them.  He was picked on by them and plots revenge against them.  He uses the SGA president and pre-law student to deny the fraternity their charter.  <br />This movie is hilarious.  Big boy dropped his attached concrete in the manhole and fell.  That has got to hurt! Seeing Will Ferrell naked was even hilarious.  He was the lone streaker until he was busted by his wife while she was driving her friends.  <br />This movie was funny and watching it the second time is even more funny!
0385336810|3.0|First off, I must say, I love the Shopaholic books.  The inventive way in which Kinsella advances the Shopaholic stories through notices from the bank and notes from Becky is really neat (and has been copied by numerous writers since).  Unfortunately, there is none of that inventiveness here in \\"Secret\\"...just standard \\"chick lit\\" fare that screams \\"SCREENPLAY\\".  Truth be told, it has already been sold and is scheduled to be made into a film with Kate Hudson.<br />Knowing that colored my reading a bit because I only saw Kate in the role...and as appropriate as she seems for the role, I hope she makes Emma more spunky and less ditzy.  But on to the real review:<br />I knew when I picked up the book that I was getting a pretty standard \\"chick\\" book, but from a writer I really enjoy.  Truthfully, until Kinsella really drops the ball, which she doesn't do here, I will read anything she writes, just as I do with Jane Green and Marian Keyes.<br />I was not disappointed in the book.  Just saddened that there seems to be no originality left in the \\"chick lit\\" world.  \\"Secret\\" is a light and fluffy read that is a good \\"palate cleanser\\" after you've read something heavy.  It's also a good book to read when you're traveling, as it shouldn't take more than a couple of days to plow through.<br />The story is simple...Emma is an entry level person at a big UK cola company (which sounds a lot like Nike as a drink company).  She is sent to Scotland as the company's representative for a big meeting.  On the return flight, the plane hits turbulence and Emma thinks she's going to die in a crash.  As a result, she blabbers on to the handsome stranger sitting next to her, telling him all her secrets.  Of course the plane doesn't crash and Monday morning when she arrives at work, Emma finds the handsome stranger is the owner of her company...an enigmatic American named Jack.  As the two begin to dance around each other, Emma is horrified that she can't hide anything from Jack since he already knows everything about her from the plane ride.  And the things Jack remembers show a soft side to a guy who seems a bit rough on the outside.<br />The interplay between the two is very funny and the way Jack uses what he knows to his advantage is both cringe inducing and sweet.  And the way in which Emma tries to hide her workplace \\"pseudo-romance\\" is priceless.  <br />You know how it will turn out, but getting there is a sweet adventure.  Of course the route of true love is never easy and the constant road blocks for Emma and Jack get a bit tiresome.  It's enough of a problem that Jack is the owner of the company, but then Kinsella has to throw in some big secret of Jack's that really gets short shrift at the end.  That secret alone could've made up a great subplot throughout the book...especially since Jack knows all of Emma's secrets but she's too blind to notice she knows nothing about Jack's.  <BR> <BR>The only major complaint I have is that Emma is a bit too much like Becky from the Shopaholic stories, but with a bit less charm.  I would hope that in her future books, Kinsella can find a different type of heroine to write about rather than disguising the same Becky character with different names and surroundings.<br />In any case, I enjoyed reading it and am not sorry that it took up my time doing it.  Though unlike the Shopaholic books, I probaby won't keep it on my shelf to re-read in the future.
B00005R1N3|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was in the 80's.  I had already been subjected to Freddy, Jason and Michael, and this scared me more than the three of them combined.  Don't get me wrong, Nightmare, Friday and Halloween were, and still are, very scary movies.  I went into it expecting the worst and came out of it wanting to go back to a time before I had witnessed it.  It scared me soooo bad that I had to sleep with the lights on for weeks afterwards.  Every time the phone rang I sank inside from fear.<br />Now I am older, wiser and more mature......... I am no longer a teen as I was when I watched this the first time.  I have been subjected to things much worse and more horrifying over the past 20 years...........  or so I thought......<br />I thought that the padding of time and the advancements of movies and cinema would cushion me.....<br />I was wrong.<br />I watched this movie again with some friends who had not seen it, yet alone even heard of it.<br />I watched in horror as every feeling came rushing back.  I watched in amusement as my friends lost every ounce of cool.  I watched in sheer delight as I witnessed, once again, one of the most terrifying movies ever made tear me and my friends to shreds of useless nothing.  Even with all the camp that is now visible in the movie, it does not let loose of its horrifying grip.<br />The premise is that there is a killer loose.  It appears that he has chosen the attic of the sorrority house to hold up in.  He uses the phone to do some of his or her terrorizing.  One by one the sorrority sisters and housemother are picked off.  And one by one the list of suspects grows until the climax at the end when everything is solved... or is it?<br />I could go on about the plot, but others have already done so.<br />If you watch this with the knowledge that this is one of the originals, not a knock off, then you will have more appreciation for it.<br />Sure, the acting is questionable, as is the directing, camera work and editing.<br />But, this is the real deal..  this is what other movies have molded themselves after.  This is the movie that deserves all the credit that others get.<br />Watch this and see if you feel the same way about unicorns that you did before you saw it.<br />And I dare you to sleep with the lights out afterwards......is the real deal..  this is what other movies have molded themselves after.  This is the movie that deserves all the credit that others get.<BR>Watch this and see if you feel the same way about unicorns that you did before you saw it.<BR>And I dare you to sleep with the lights out afterwards......
B00002E233|3.0|Its great, but not. Ya know? Well let me explain it to you this way: its well scary at first ya know watchin it when you're 7, 8 years old but then it gets boring after about watching it 10 more times (im exxagerating so go with me) its about 5 people (i think) who are tryin to make sharks smarter, so  they have to get near the sharks after they are injected with the smart shark potin thing. This one guy gets to close and he gets his arm bitten off (so cool!) so they rush him off to the hospital in a helicopter but falls in the water and drowns. Then both the girls died (man!) so then there are 4 guys left then the black guy is making a speech in front of the water hole where they go in and out of the water (big Mistake!) and gets pulled down from the sharks and u see them under water and they rip him in half (haha). so 3 guys left (they are trying to fix the under water house thing from getting water in it all because the guy with the ripped arm got pushed in to the glasss by one of the sharks) anyway there are 3 guys left and the other black guy (the cook) the sharks eat his parrot and so he gets mad and he sets him on fire with a match. But still alive and so they survive and its only those three who survive. Its pretty good You should buy it if you like shark movies with blood and killing and people getting ripped in half.
B000002G89|5.0|I actually remember the day this album was released - it was two days after I saw Clapton and his band at the Capital Centre in D.C.. He played much of it at the show, and I was anxious to hear the songs again.<br /><br />This album didn't disappoint that day, and it doesn't disappoint today. Contrary to another review, it ages quite well. The rock covers (\\"Willie and the Hand Jive,\\" \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\"hold their own with the originals, and the blues songs are timeless. \\"I Can't Hold Out\\" and \\"Steady Rolling Man\\" kick major blues butt! The originals are excellent as well, particularly \\"Mainline Florida.\\"<br /><br />Any record collecion that includes Eric Clapton is incomplete without this record. It was his comeback effort following several years of laying low with a heroin problem. It is clearly a career milestone, and his first recording with a band that he would work with for the remainder of the decade. Don't overlook the band - with the exception of Duane Allman, George Terry may be the best guitarist Clapton worked with - he compliments Clapton and drives him at the same time.
B0000DCGT7|4.0|This movie was somewhat funny.  Jim and Michelle are getting married and Stifler is back.  This time eating (...) Jim is trying to impress his true love from the first movie, which is more hilarious.  <br />American Wedding is okay compared to American Pie, which was hilariously off the hook.  This movie was more romantic and serious than funny.  Marriage is more than just sex.  It's about true love, finding the right person to be with.  Jim and Michelle prove that love is not dead.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|UNDERWORLD is visually impressive, with its dark, dark underworld and the lack of real &quot;color&quot; in the film.  Blues, greys, blacks, and of course a little blood red(even it is dark) combine to create an atmospheric world of evil.  Lots of flashy special effects and imaginative camerawork.  The cast does some good work:  Kate Beckinsale, Shawn Brolly, Bill Nighy, and Michael Sheen in particular; Scott Speedman walks through his role as a zombie, which is not part of the horror menu here.  So what's wrong?  The movie has no real likeable characters, as if one should like a vampire or werewolf, and there is such disregard for human or other life that it left me feeling vacant and unaffected.  Nice to look at, but empty calories.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye is a new rapper, but definately not new to the rap game as he has been producing for a while and he obviously knows what he is doing as shown in the album.  The beats he uses are extremely catchy and the lyrics are are not about bling bling which is nice.  Anybody who is into rap should get this album.  Also ive met Kanye and he is so cool it made me want to buy a second album just because he was so chill.
B0000A0DS7|5.0|I'm going to tell you a little secret. I like metal music. No that's not the secret. Hell, you all already know that. My secret is that even though I like metal music, the guitar is not my favorite instrument. Oh like guitars just fine but in metal music it just goes with the territory. What really gets my attention is any and all of the following things augmenting and enhancing, even overpowering the guitars.<br />Give me choirs, pianos, organs, violins, bells, cellos and great female singing. This is why I like the music of Therion, Within Temptation, Nightwish and Edenbridge to name a few.<br />Enter, Epica!<br />Epica is good! Epica is very good! Epica is magnificent, Epica is, well....Epic! Epica is a breath of fresh air in this genre of music I like to think of as the new wave of metal music for the new millennium. Not really better but a little different.<br />I never thought anyone would top Within Temptation until fellow Dutch band Epica came along. I'm still not sure they have but it's close. Epica is a new Dutch band following in the footsteps of two Dutch giants - Within Temptation and After Forever. Founder Mark Jansen is very familiar with After Forever since he was one of their founding members and a former guitar player. He left A.F. citing artistic differences. Like W.T.and A.F., Epica plays Symphonic Metal with a female singer, Simone Simons whose voice is pleasant enough but doesn't seem to have the power of some of the other European divas.<br />Phantom Agony<br />The first thing I notice and like about this album is the increased use of a choir. This is probably to make up for the loss of a top notch soprano such as Floor Jansen. As much as I like Floor, I like this new direction.<br />Phantom Agony is also reminiscent of Therion's recent efforts, which is another reason I like the CD, with the intrinsic use of a choir of two sopranos, two altos, a tenor and a bass and a small orchestra of three violins, two violas, two cellos and a contrabass. Occasionally heavy, but never hard, keyboards and the orchestra play a more sifnificant role on this album than the guitars and that's fine with me.<br />Song/Track list<br />1] Adyta (The Neverending Embrace) (1:26)****1/2<br />2] Sensorium (4:48)****1/2<br />3] Cry For The Moon [The Embrace That Smothers - Part IV] (6:44)*****<br />4] Feint (4:19)****<br />5] Illusive Consensus (5:00)****1/2<br />6] Facade Of Reality [The Embrace That Smothers - Part V] (8:12)*****<br />7] Run For A Fall (6:32)****1/2<br />8] Seif Al Din [The Embrace That Smothers - Part VI] (5:47)****1/2<br />9] The Phantom Agony (8:59)*****<br />10]The Phantom Agony (4:34)***** single version<br />Out of necessity all songs have a similar sound and feeling so I will describe the highlights.<br />&quot;Cry For The Moon&quot; (The Embrace That Smothers - Part IV)<br />the songs starts out with Simone and is taken over by the choir, which is magnificent. The middle contains faster drums with a clever mixture of soaring violins answered by the choir. There are some male growls but it feels like it's part of a story. This is an intriguing song.<br />&quot;Facade Of Reality&quot; (The Embrace That Smothers - Part V) bombastic guitar and violin laden sounds prevail. The pieces of Latin lyrics and dark grunts give this song an epic quality. Halfway through the song becomes much slower and cello and violins support Tony Blair commenting on terrorism after the events of September 11th. Thereafter the pace gets back to normal.<br />&quot;Phantom Agony&quot;, the title tracks uses recurring refrain consisting of short violin notes, the choir, the bass guitar and bass drums throughout this 9 minute epic masterpiece. The whispering in the beginning and ending adds a nice touch. The last couple minutes of this song is a good example of how this album feels like a movie score.<br />&quot;Phantom Agony&quot; single version is a bonus track on the ltd edition. It's about half as long as the epic version.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are under the impression that I like this album, good for you, you got that right. Now that you're on a role, you need to check this out and at least see why I'm so impressed. Why?

B00005U11Z|5.0|Here's the only drawback for this great concert video.  I wish that the guys would have invested more effort in the extra features.  No interviews, and very little backstage footage made me wish for more.  Then on came the show.  The first song was the powerful &quot;Seperate Ways,&quot; and Steve Augeri immediately nailed the vocals that were originally piped by the other Steve (Perry).  Strong to the end.  Then the other &quot;new&quot; member, Deen Castronovo played with power and precision equal to any of the previous Journey drummer.  As well he should.  Deen played with Neil Schon on Ted Nugent's &quot;Double Live Gonzo&quot; as well as with many other artists including Ozzy Osbourne, Steve Vai, and with Schon and Jonathan Cain in Bad English and on their respective solo projects.  Deen is no stranger to the Journey experience! Best of all is the strong song set and video and audio clarity.  If you've experienced a live Journey show lately and as often as I have, you'll really appreciate this collection of songs!  This was one of the rare concerts where Journey played the gorgeous &quot;All the Way,&quot; and &quot;La Raza del Sol.&quot;  <BR>This DVD is a must buy for any Journey fan or any fan of melodic, classic rock.

B000005IU2|5.0|Funhouse is probably one the best albums of the seventies. Filled with rhythm, funk and kick, the Stooges give you the ultimate underground party mix. <br />Recorded in 1970, this gave birth to what is now known as proto-punk. The Stooges deliver with power and lust like no band before or since, influencing everyone from the New York Dolls to the Germs. With the cathy appeal of the Rolling Stones and the mystery of the Doors. <br />The cd begins with &quot;Down on the Street&quot; a fun openner that is followed by the themes &quot;Loose&quot; and the classic &quot;TV Eye&quot;, which contains one of the greatest guitar riffs of all time. <br />&quot;Dirt&quot; and &quot;Funhouse&quot; are 7 minute plus epics that combine jazz and blues with punk insanity. <br />The album get its fuel from a mixture of jazz and rock. The mixture of guitars and saxophones is chilling and quite impressive. If it wasn't for the Stooges, music would have collapsed in the 1970s into the world of consumtion and mediocre, like it is today. But luckily we have Funhouse to listen to and reminise about better days.
0446677450|2.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad had moments of brilliance and moments of boredom. As a highschool student, making life choices at the moment, I could relate to the life choices one must make in order to be a success; yet Kiyosaki's suggestions for success, reminded me of a self help book. Using such effective devices as, usage of personal connections with the reader, Kiyosaki also came off slimy. The slimy qualities coming from his sympathy and admiration for both his fathers, but a biased for wealth and power. The interest for me, as a young reader was his family story. One father would say, &quot;I'm not interested in money,&quot; while the other would say, &quot;Money is power.&quot; The parallel universes of his homelives, cultivated trust in the author. He shared personal moments of his life to later persuade a unhealthy love of money and the baggage it comes with. <br />Overall, the book had some helpful suggestions and advice for building one's own power, yet he left out the richness of life and love, replacing it with materials.

B00006879E|5.0|This is a great CD. Seems like everyone who hears it gets addicted--with a few exceptions. If you are an elitist music nerd, you won't like it--It's too much fun. And if you have a problem with white musicians being influenced by black music, you won't like it on principle. Otherwise, you'll love the combination of rock and funk and the cool, the excellent musicianship, and the literate lyrics.
B000005IS1|5.0|MC5 were one of the original anarchist groups, before there was even a such thing as punk. With insane live shows and inspiring lyircs, MC5 put Detroit on the rock n roll map and gave us something else from Mo-Town. <br />This album was released to show how great a band the MC5 were. Not only that, it is by far the best live recording of all time. The sound quality sounds like it was made in a studio, and the music featured is like a constant good time. <br />Kick out the jams, Mother F**ker
0792840070|3.0|What one realizes while watching this is how limited and ultimately unsatisfactory is a relationship based purely on sex.<br />I imagine that the familiar dominance/submissive psychology at the heart of this visually stunning movie--and it really is beautifully shot--comes from the novel by Elizabeth MacNeil.  I say that, not having read the novel, because the seduction of Manhattan art dealer Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) by the smooth and supremely confident financier John (Mickey Rourke) is so very well done with the expensive presents, the well-timed flower deliveries, little endearments, etc., that it amounts to a woman's fantasy.  The partial debasement of Elizabeth and her eventual triumph over her darker instincts and her realization that there is a difference between love and submission is also something that one might expect to find in a woman's point-of-view novel.<br />However when we get to the actual sexuality and how it is acted out, it is unclear who dreamed up the scenes, MacNeil or director Adrian Lyne or the scriptwriters.  I say this because the scenes were so predictable and so ordinary, and when not ordinary and predictable, were bordering on the just plain dumb.  Making love in the rain, at the top of a tall building (inside the clock tower), blindfolding the woman, making her crawl, feeding her strawberries, etc., bring nothing new to eroticism.  And the scene requiring some imagination--[...]--was not realistically done.  Why directors insist on allowing a man holding onto the hand of woman to outrun the men chasing them never ceases to amaze me.  And then to have Elizabeth and John stop in the middle of the street to allow the bashers they have outrun to catch up was just plain stupid, not to mention the phony fight that followed.<br />Not only were the sexual scenes predictable but clearly Lyne was in harness (and I am glad of that) since he stops well short of what might happen if this sort of theme were fully played out.<br />Putting all that aside what makes this movie worth seeing is Kim Basinger.  She is absolutely stunning, and it is clear that Lyne and his camera adored her.  More than that Basinger does a fine job of acting in a demanding role.  I was impressed.  Before seeing this film I thought she was a rather ordinary actress, but her ability to combine grown-up New York chic with little-girl vulnerability and to make absolutely clear the psychological dilemma her character's heart faced really held the movie together.<br />Lyne's insistence on whispered dialogue difficult to hear was consistent with the theme of the movie but not kind to these ears.  But that was okay because much of the dialogue was secondary to the visual exploration of the woman's sexuality.  The peek-a-boo and off center and shadowed shots of Basinger's face and her silhouette, and the studied smile from Rourke combined with the stark black and whites of their clothes and the furnishings served to highlight and emphasis the flesh tones of Basinger's skin while lending an appropriate artistic and fashionable atmosphere to the movie, which after all has an art dealer at its center.  The many scenes that were began and suggested, and then cut away from, allowed a richer texture of experience for the viewer than would have been possible had the scenes been played out.  And that was doubly good because again it is the visuals that make this movie worth seeing, not the originality of the story and its development.<br />To those viewers who thought that this was some sort of high class pornography, I can only say you missed the point entirely, and indeed, you may be projecting your own sorry mentality.<br />See this for Kim Basinger whose sensitive and robust beauty dominated the screen.aside what makes this movie worth seeing is Kim Basinger.

That is what I learned reading this book and these are the lessons I will follow though the years.
B0000CE742|4.0|This is pretty much a definitive collection of Cher's hits.  Much more comprehensive than the 1999 \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection (International only) and the recent single-disc compilation, \\"The Very Best of Cher\\".  <br />However, I found the sequencing on those CDs much better than this one.  This one starts off with her 90s and 80s hits but it pretty much goes all over the map once you hit the halfway point on the first disc.  The second disc is made up of some recent dance songs, classics from the 60s and 70s and some duets from each decade.  But I wish the album had followed a chronological order.  You get no sense of how Cher's voice or sound gradually changed throughout the years.  <br />The one glaring omission is Cher's version of \\"Alfie\\" which hit the top 40 and a favorite of Cher's, and a version which is somewhat overshadowed by Cilla Black and Dionne Warwick's versions.  I would also have liked to have heard more songs from her 1987 self-titled comeback album and 1996's \\"It's A Man's World\\".
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a great movie, my daughter watches it nearly every night (until she falls asleep). If you're looking for more - I'd recommend some of the IMAX films about the ocean - including Coral Reef Adventure -- and another interesting DVD - Captain Jon Explores the Ocean - both available on Amazon.
0671027344|5.0|(...) Until I read ...Wallflower, i didn't think a book of this kind could compete with(...). I loved it because it tells the story in a real aspect, the way teens can understand. I enjoyed how it wasn't glossed over...it told of kids doing drugs and experimenting with their sexuality and suppressing feelings and memories. It was raw and emotional, just like us teens. Any teenage or young adult could appreciate and relate to this book. I found many things to relate to while reading it, and I have never done drugs or experienced the death of a close friend. It's not just a book for suicidal or melodramatic teens, it can touch anyone's heart. Pick up a copy of this book immediately.
B00009MGGI|5.0|The Brits may no longer rule the world, but they sure produce some of the best television the medium has seen. In any discussions of the best projects or series in television history, this trilogy will have a place.<br />The series opens with Conservative Party Whip, Francis Urquhart, fondly holding a portrait of Margaret Thatcher, remarking that all things, no matter how good, must come to an end. This perfectly sets the time and tone of what is to follow. Urquhart must maneuver and control the political scene in the power vacuum left by the exit of the Iron Lady.<br />This production strives for Shakespearean proportions, and hits the bull's eye. The main character, Urquhart, played by Ian Richardson, is a crafty blend of Macbeth and King Richard. Like Macbeth, Urquhart has a power hungry wife gently messaging his shoulders and whispering pretty treacheries in his ear; and like Richard, Urquhart takes the viewer into his confidence, revealing his black plans with wicked joy. This technique of Urquhart speaking directly to you, the viewer, is a tremendous stroke. Like with King Richard, you will find yourself somehow cheering for this cold, angular blade of a man, as he slices through well-meaning fools and bumbling bullies alike (or, as Urquhart says, &quot;put a bit of stick about&quot;).<br />A great production throughout, with wonderful writing and acting. Highly recommended. --Mykal Banta

0440238609|5.0|I do not believe that it is possible to better His Dark Materials as a trilogy - as anything. I have never been so engrossed and enraptured by a work of fiction as this - it is a perfect whole, many layered and complex. Intellectually challenging, stimulating and rewarding but also humanly engaging. Will and Lyra and most of all Mrs Coulter are breathtaking literary creations. Some books flare in a burst of publicity and then age and fade away, I think that these three will grow and grow - what a way to start a century! Masterful. His Dark Materials defies categorisation - to see them as childrens books or cross-over books is a nonsense. They are books for everyone and anyone. Read them and weep.

0385504209|1.0|i wanted to see what would make a bestseller - and now i know, appeals to the lowest common denominator.  it is a somewhat entertaining book because i did not have to use much of my intellect.  however, it insults the intelligence of many people especially in places where the author attempts to explain, e.g., how much $20 million euro is, who designed the pyramids at the Louvre, etc.  but worse is the writing, the lack of character development and the interesting similarity in plot (and plot only) with umberto's foucault's pendulum, though the latter books is a masterpiece.  so, if one is looking for an entertaining book on the plane, this might be an ok book.  but if one is looking for intellectually honest book with superb writing, this will definitely disappoint you.
0385504209|2.0|I was excited to read this, having heard from so many people how they *loved* this book.  Imagine my surprise when I found an interesting plot (I don't know how much of it is accurate, but his main thesis is fun to consider) but with such boring, cardboard one-dimensional characters, that I kept getting distracted by how bad they were.  The book is readable, but by no means a feat of literature.  As a friend of mine said, it is like reading a Hardy boys' mystery...but without the pathos!
0743243307|4.0|Not as much fun as White Teeth and not as deep as Midnight's Children. I did enjoy reading Monica Ali's much hyped new novel, but really felt it a quite light, entertaining novel that was let down by lapses into cliche. I think there is a curious situation with books that refer to a specific community and are written by someone who comes from that community - the voice is taken to be very authentic and that allows them to draw upon a pool of 2-dimensional characters that an outsider would not necessarily get away with. I thought the novel was well paced and well written, but I did feel frustrated by the gallery of characters - the rebellious friend, the hypocritical maintainer of old-style values (who is a Usurer), the not-good, not-bad sad husband, the down-trodden doctor, the sexy revolutionary. I felt I had met them all before in a myriad of other novels. I do however think that Nazneen is an immensely likeable heroine and she did live for me. More than that Ali should be commended for dealing with the impact of 9/11 on the Muslim community so directly. I'm sure Ali will develop and grow as a writer and there a signs of something very good here - but she's not there yet.

B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvana may not have been the first people to start grunge music, in fact they may have heard Soundgarden or Pearl Jam and then were inspired to make that kind of music OR Nirvana could have been the makers of Grunge music.. it doesnt matter either way, Nirvana was the band that did it the best, Nirvana was the band with the most talent. I personally think that Nirvana is better and alot harder than Pearl Jam even though Peral Jam is still a great band. In Utero is Kurts last goodbye to the world and each song has so much emotion and energy in it. The lyrics on each track are genius and are extremely hard to understand, in fact we may interpret them differently then the way Kurt Cobain intended us to, but he has some incredible lines on this CD. This is Nirvana's best work, better than Nevermind(also a great CD) but this is my opinion. The guitar is alot more distorted on this album then any of the other Nirvana albums and it isnt polished the way Nevermind was.Nirvana was a great band with Dave Grohl pounding the drums, Krist Novelstic playing an awesome bass, and Kurt Cobain with his genious lyric writing ability and tremendous singing ability. Let me go through all the great tracks on this album so you can get an idea of how good it was.<br />1. Serve the Servants 85%<BR>A great opening song to the CD, talking about teen angst and not having someone there when you need him, it has a good guitar riff and the verses are very catchy, the chorus lacks a little bit though. <br />2. Scentless Apprentice 75%<BR>Kurt really screeches on this one, every band member had a part in writing this song, my least favorite on the CD even though its pretty good, one of the harder tracks.<br />3. Heart-Shaped Box 100%<BR>Wow. This song is amazing and has so much depth, the lyrics are so in depth that people actually analyze this songs lyrics and the music video Kurt made for it to find the true meaning. The chorus is amazing and has a feel of rebellion. Known to be one of the greatest if not the greatest Nirvana song of all time. My personal 2nd favorite Nirvana song of all time, with Smells Like Teen Spirit at Number 1. &quot;Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back&quot;...what a great line.<br />4. Rape Me 95%<BR>Another amazing song with fantastic lyrics. The song is an anti-rape song where Kurt is a girl being raped saying &quot;Rape Me&quot; because he'll get it a lot worse after hes done &quot;you'll always stink and burn.&quot; Alot of peoples favorite Nirvana song as well. The guitar riff is very similar to &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;<br />5. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle 95%<BR>I got really hooked on this song, its very catchy and has a good guitar riff. This songs about Frances Farmer who was an actress who then went insane and ws put into an insane asylum. The song is great with lines like &quot;I miss the comfort in being sad&quot;, one of the best lines Kurt ever wrote.<br />6. Dumb 85%<BR>One of the catchiest on the album, not as hard as the other tracks. About being in love and feeling Dumb. The verses sound alot like those of &quot;On A Plain.&quot;<br />7. Very Ape 80%<BR>Good guitar, good drums, everything a good rock song needs. Not one of my favorites but still good.<br />8. Milk It 100%<BR>This song is truly amazing. It is very dark, strange, and distorted. I didn't like it at first now I love it. One of the scariest guitar riffs ive ever heard. This song will make you feel very down. This is Kurt's suicide note to the world, the chorus goes &quot;look on the bright side is suicide.&quot;<br />9. Pennyroyal Tea 85%<BR>Made back before Nevermind and sounds like a Nevermind song. The song is catchy and mellow. The chorus is good but the verses are lacking.<br />10. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter 85%<BR>This song is pretty good, this one part in the song is awesome and I wish that would have been the chorus, the &quot;hate your friends save your enemies&quot; part. The song is about finding your place and knowings your surroundings in life.<br />11. Tourettes 90%<BR>This song is the hardest and craziest on the album, when you first hear it you wonder how its even a song because you can hardly understand what hes saying. But for some odd reason its really addictive and great to listen to if your angry.<br />12. All Apologies 80%<BR>Everyone loves this song but for some reason I havn't been able to get hooked on it. The lyrics are great but I just dont think the song music-wise is that good. Good quote at the end &quot; All in all is all we are.&quot;<br />If your a Nirvana fan and you dont like the distorted, dark sound of this album then I understand because at first I didnt like this album, try giving it a few listens and you will really appreciate this albums glory.
B000063DFQ|5.0|After Bruce Dickinson's vocalist debut on The Number of The Beast, Iron Maiden rose into further prominence and into their most glorious period of the band's history.  Piece Of Mind had risen the bar in the heavy metal scene amidst a budding thrash scene (Anthrax, Metallica, and Slayer made its &quot;baby steps&quot;, so to speak at the time this album was originally released).  This album and Powerslave were influential in its musicianship, songwriting, and vocals as a measuring stick for serious heavy metal before (heyday) Metallica had arguably taken that designation later on.  Here's a track-by-track rundown:<br />1. Where Eagles Dare: Right off the bat, the opener is a long, fast, rip-roaring track.  There's not a whole lot of singing (only for the first minute and a half and the last minute or so), but the middle of the song being an awesome instrumental with all kinds of fancy riffs and rapid drumming.  The song is based off the book and movie, &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;. 5/5.<br />2. Revelations: A stark contrast from the opener in that the tempo and mood changes in this solo-laden song. Bruce's vocals are just simply outstanding, especially the first verse. 5/5.<br />3. Flight Of Icarus: If you're new to Maiden and are making the transition from 90's or contemporary metal, this song isn't the most ideal starting point. A rather steady rocker which some have said is overrated since the chorus is too hauntingly catchy and Bruce's vocals are most over the top in this one.  Hands down, Bruce's vocals are the highlight of this, especially when he holds onto the last note. 5/5.<br />4. Die With Your Boots On: A flat-out fast, anthemic rocker, which starts off with awesome opening riffs and chorus riffs.  Bruce's vocals are quite underrated here; you just have to love how this voice soars in the chorus. 5/5.<br />5. The Trooper: It doesn't take very long for this song to blow you away. The opening riff is absolutely divine and added with the drums, the tempo isa galloping one as if you're riding on horseback, as one reviewer put it.  The visceral lyrics really do put you on the battlefield. 5/5.<br />The next three tracks demand a few listens to get a good reaction:<br />6. Still Life: Starts off awkwardly with a voice speaking backwards and a peaceful, low-line bass riff for the first minute or so, with Bruce's vocals at its most low-key.  About after a minute and a half, you have a melodic rocker, which gives a majestic, airy feel especially at the chorus part. 5/5.<br />7. Quest of Fire: This track and the next one, Sun Of Steel, usually get the most injustice as being labeled &quot;filler&quot;.  It maintains that gallop of The Trooper, but it seems a bit bouncier.  The chorus, although quite over the top, makes for a rather good sing-along. 4/5.<br />8. Sun of Steel: Melodic, has a faster gallop than Quest of Fire does.  Bruce's vocals shine very well here and much like the previous track, the chorus is a fun sing-along. 4.5/5.<br />9. To Tame a Land: A surprisingly brooding, moody epic track, which just goes to show you the range of how heavy Maiden can play. I still think Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a tad superior over this, but the amazing solos are worth the listen. 5/5.<br />Piece Of Mind is nothing short of classic Maiden.  If you're new to the band, I recommend you don't buy any of their CD's...yet.  Try listening to individual tracks because Maiden is the type of band that you have to digest slowly in chunks, especially if you're raised in today's school of hard rock.  I would start off by listening to tracks off Number of the Beast like &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;, &quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot;, &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; and *sigh* &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;.  If you like that, you could buy Number of the Beast, or better yet, purchase Powerslave first, which is a lot like this album.  Happy listening.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|The reason I give this dvd 4 instead of 5 stars is that like many of the best movies, its not something I envision most people watching over and over again - like say a stupid comedy or a throwaway action flick.  As a result I view this as a better rental (say once every 3 years) than a purchase.  In any case though, its a great film.  It captures the feeling of being out of place and living in a foreign country really perfectly.  Any one who has ever done it knows that it can be a really traumatic experience.  The isolation invariably leads to a lot of introspection and basically that is what this movie is about: introspection. The actors and director really capture the mood and pace of such an experience really well.  The shots of Japan are memorable.  Furthermore the extras in the dvd are also highly interesting to fans of the film - the documentary is not a piece of cable PR like is often the case and the discussions with bill murray, spike jones, sophia coppalla, et al are really insightful.  If you havent seen the movie and think you can handle the slow unwinding pace this movie is a cant miss... Im just not SURE you really need to OWN it.

B00004RJ74|4.0|This is really two movies in one.  First is the ultra-violent crime spree.  Second is the ultra-violent horror film.  Packaging used to concentrate on the first part so I avoided picking this one up until recently.<br />The Gecko brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarrantino) are running for the border and leaving bodies in their wake.  One brother is rather twisted.  They kidnap a family and manage to get safely across the border to Mexico.<br />Once in Mexico they head for a biker/trucker bar to make meet their contact.  Unfortunately, the bar is actually a front for hordes of vampires.  Much violence ensues until the final climactic battle.<br />A very interesting film but it does come off as two separate pieces.  There is the crime film and then the horror film as if the film makers had two ideas and only one budget.  My biggest problem was the sheer number of vampires.  There were so many they should have bled Mexico dry years ago.<br />This film is followed by two sequels but they do not have the same characters.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|This set is an absolute must for anyone who is a Weezer fan.  The two cds are a necessary addition to anyones existing Weezer collection, or a great to start for anyone who wants to hear some Weezer for the first time.<br />The first disc contains all 10 songs from the original blue album, with a slightly different sound.  While the common man won't take much interest in having essentially another copy of the blue album, this disc is a must for any Weezer fan.  <br />The second disc (titled \\"Dusty Gems and Raw Nuggets\\") contains a variety of music from Weezer's early years.  There a couple of new songs, along with some B-sides most people haven't heard.  Along with those we get live versions of  My Name is Jonas, Surf Wax America, Jamie, and No One Else.  Fans and new listeners alike will soak up these new tunes.<br />I also recommend buying the Weezer \\"Video Capture Device\\" DVD along with this.
B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go is without a doubt, the best album released by a female artist in all history.  It amazes me at how much talent Avril has singing and lyric wise.  This is an astonishing album that is fun, catchy, and full of meaning.  I could listen to it over and over and never get tired of it.  Her lyrics are mature and something that people can relate to.  She's definitely talented beyond her age.  This album rocks!
B00005JKLZ|4.0|If you watch this film to compare it to the George Pal version or to the book, you will be disappointed. To literally tranlate Wells onto film won't work. he's too dated And to Pal fans it is heresy to say someone can do as well. I, personally, never thought much of the Pal version. Okay for it's time but not all that spectacular. <BR>But this is a film only based on Well's story. Not limited to it. Just like the movie War of the Worlds was only based on Wells<BR>This film has charm all it's own. The musical score is interesting enough to buy the cd. And the CGI effects are understated so they don't overwhelm the story. I would have fleshed out the story more. Perhaps a half hour more. If there is a valid complaint , it might be that Well's social commentary doesn't come through very well. But by creating the charactor of the &quot;uberMorlock&quot; (played interestingly enough by Jeremy Irons) the director gets to slip a bit of his own social commentary about the world changing and how we deal with it. Watch for the typical American reaction to change. That which offends us, we blow up. I will have to say that Samantha Mumba makes a refreshing change from Yvette Minieux who I have never liked in any part. Guy Pierce also plays the Time Traveler not as a ruff &amp; tumble he-man (ala Rod Taylor)but as a frustrated academic.<BR>A nice film if you leave your comparisons and prejudices aside.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|For those of you who consider this little gem of a movie to be &quot;boring&quot;, you have no heart. This is possibly one of the sweetest, loveliest films I've ever seen. It's also fresh and unique, something that can't be said for much coming out Hollywood these days. Murray's subtle performance is both tragic and gently funny--a brillant turn on his part, even more so than &quot;Rushmore,&quot; where I felt he was much more cynical and dark. Johannsen is wise beyond her years, and I can't wait to see what she does next--great things are coming to this young woman. The two of them, along with Miss Coppola, succeed in creating an atmosphere of almost tangible loneliness and melancholy, while at the same time carefully piecing together a simple story about two souls finding each other in the most unlikely of settings. This movie isn't just worth watching--it's worth owning and experiencing on a regular basis. As for all you close-minded people who refuse to sit through this wonderful film, you're the reason Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson still have careers.

Taxman and She Said are good songs of a different type, but Yellow Submarine, Here There &amp; Everywhere, Eleanor Rigby, etc. don't have the energy of the Beatles' earlier work.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I went to the theatre to see this with my mother-in-law. The beginning was nice. Starts off reminding us to get refreshed in human nature by going to the airport and watching the people at the arrival gate. Then you had to follow 5 different story lines. The love interest had the language of a merchant marine. One couple (they are porn star body doubles)meets in a vulgar display of acting out sex scenes, it was embarrassing at best. We were very disappointed. We felt it had such comic potential, ruined by the disgusting content, unnecessarily added in our opinion.
0062502182|5.0|I finished to read The Alchemist in my Englis Language Arts class. My instructor, Anthony De Lorenzo gave us because is his favorite book, and we worked on it. I learned how follow the dreams, never stop. I remember my life. with fear, without love, only life for life, without any sense. Santiago was always optimist, he never was afraid.<BR>     I liked this book very much, because I have to learn let my fears, reaching my dreams like Santiago, begin to fly. I believe the dreams come true, if you want do it, if you want follow them. I reached a dream when I came to the USA but I need others dreams come true.&quot; There is more time than life&quot;, says my Grandma, I hope have time enough for my dreams.<BR>     This book change my life a little bit. Now I beginning my own personal legend. I will learn to hear my heart, hear the people, my parents, my friends.<BR>     When I feel the pure love, my life will be complete.<BR>     It's a great story.
B00006690G|5.0|I dont get it i put my review on which made perfect sense but now i got beef with repplibeast. I aint gonna diss u i jus got somethin to say. I dont gotta problem with white rappers my best friend is white and im a quarter white we both rap but we live in harlem and are very poor. the only reason im usin this computer is cuz im at my aunts house in Long island i do have a problem with people who rap but aint grew up in the hood. Rap was created so people in the hood who had a hard life could express their feelings n expieriences in music. But eminem did not go thru to much his mom was an alcoholic but my parents have some alcohol problems and i love them because they are very nice to me n they work their asses off just so my family can have a place to live food and clothes. What rap needs is creativity important issues n more gangsta s**t. Eminem was very creative on his 1st album with good beats by dre but not from the streets. i cant stand the fact that eminem is praised by critics for saying he wants to kill his mom but criticize other rappers for promoting violence because they rap about their expeiriences in the hood but its the opposite. He only makes fun of his mom to make $ but i would never make fun of my mom or dad. this album was made just for the benjamins not for the music n thats the problem with rap these days. repplibeast u should listen to amerikkkas most wanted by ice cube for great issues  brought up, or 6th chamber by wu tang clan which is real creative
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This movie moves like two travelogues, spliced together for the scenes where the two main characters are not together. It is not a plot driven film. There is nothing to &quot;get&quot; or to guess at. It's more of an observation, leaving conclusions to be made by any and all with a need to make them. It had the decency not to presume to try and convey a neat and tidy message or attempt to speak to universal truths, at least it didn't to me.  If you are not one who believes that movies have to &quot;go somewhere&quot;, check this out. If you are someone who can sit and let exquisitely filmed imagery stir you in ways you don't feel a need (or an ability) to explain, who enjoys seeing quality actors put in interesting situations delivering terrific dialogue, and who won't sit simply &quot;waiting for something to happen&quot;, check this out. No car chases, no nudity, no ass-kicking, no saccharine ending. I'll probably give 5 stars after seeing it another time or two. Phenomenal soundtrack as well.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|When I heard that this box set had come out I was excited to buy it because I am a big fan of the Alien movies.  Reading the above reviews made me think twice about buying this.  When I saw the price drop from $80, I just had to order it.  The day the package arrived I checked the disk to see if they were scratched and non of them were.  I tested all the dvd's in 4 different dvd players and they all worked perfectly!.  I tested them on Pioneer 525, RCA RC5215P, Toshiba SD2800, and Samsung DVDC624.  Do not let the reviews stop you from buying this! It is a great set to have in your dvd archive.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|The Blue Album will stand as a masterpiece.  This cd is always in heavy rotation in my CD player.  The songs on this album sound better and the bonus disk is a great add on.  Full of b-sides, live songs, unreleased material, and orginal versions of some of Weezer's great songs.  Included is a booklet with photos and lyrics.  A great buy for Weezer fans and newcomers.
B000099T2L|3.0|This CD isn't all that great, there are a few decent songs on it:<br />Crazy in Love<BR>Naughty Girl<BR>Baby Boy<BR>Me, Myself, and I <br />But the rest of the CD didn't really cut it for me. She has a good voice and all but the songs just basically all sounded the same to me. I wish she had a bit more variety, than the CD would have been better. Maybe next time. I was also surprised to see some of the sexuality in this CD especially after I thought I remembered Beyonce trying to act a bit more virginal and bashing those who were too sexual in their work. Dunno, I could be mistaken. 3/5 stars for Beyonce.
B00006LHYC|2.0|Pausini had a voice of her own until now. She sounds so much like Celine Dion, its depressing. I hope she retires in English because  she just doesn't do it. This recording only sold a meager 45,000 copies. Not that she has no talent, but the lyrics are weak and forgettable. There are no bright moments, and this cd is overall boring. Tres boring! No wonder only 45,000 people bought it. Get &quot;Entre tu y mil mares&quot; instead or her previous productions.
0786867973|5.0|The absolute perfect book for the creative baker.  Nigella gives ideas for different variations and always identifies which areas of the recipe can be played with and which can't.  There is so much stuff jam-packed in this book that I can't see myself ever getting tired of it.<br /><br />Embarrassingly enough, I couldn't find anything that I didn't want to try, so I just started at the beginning.  The Easy Almond Cake was a favorite at my house, as well as the Victoria Sponge Cake (both the zucchini and the fruit version).  I can't wait to try the Lavender Cupcakes.<br /><br />The quality of the book itself is unsurpassable.  I love the glossy pages and the beautiful photographs.  Nigella always seems to take such personal care in her work, that it's like having a friend in the kitchen with you.  The only problem I have with this book is that it doesn't fit into my cheap cookbook holder.<br /><br />If, like me, you can't decide which you'd rather do more, eat one of Nigella's cakes, or hang out with Nigella herself - yet you balk at some of her entrees (I initially had Nigella Bites but exchanged it for this one) - this is the book for you.
B0000DZ3EA|3.0|Ive just recieved my copy of this &quot;Hit&quot; and &quot;Misses&quot; and something its &quot;missing&quot;... my personal favourite &quot;in your eyes&quot; is not included !!!<BR>I previously looked at the tracklisting here at amazon and I found it on the second CD the number 7, but the one I have in my hands has a different tracklisting and this song its not listed !!!!<BR>Im a bit disappointed... I must buy the album &quot;So&quot; to get that song finally...
B000066HI4|5.0|It boggles my mind that someone can sit down and write these kinds of melodies.  If we're all looking for that perfect combination of notes and words - the kind clearly understood by the Beatles - &quot;A Minor Place&quot; is it, along with several other tracks on this record, such as &quot;Madeleine-Mary&quot; and &quot;All Around.&quot;<br /><br />I like it in the same way I like the Shins' &quot;New Slang&quot;, Mogwai's &quot;Haunted by a Freak&quot;, and Brian Eno's _Another Green World_. Something about it won't let you go.
6305907145|3.0|The cast in this film is awesome! Franis O'Conner was wonder as Fanny Price. I thought that it did justice to Jane Austin's writtings. It portraited subjects, that Jane Austin rarely ever wrote about, with great style. It will be a treasure to my movie collection for years to come.
B000002VCB|5.0|I cant explain it, but it seems for me the later the 70s the better. September, 1979......right there close to 80, when it seemed the levee broke and flooded the airwaves with less inspired music...(Queen;the game Yes;drama).<BR>Ive always had this bizarre fascination with 1979 recordings. Its so on the edge of almost not sounding 70s. But I can tell. I can tell the difference between a 79` recording and an 80` one without even thinking about it. <BR>This album REEKS of 1979 and its just too precious to me. The sound  quality is absolutely prestine. It really sounds perfect. Stuart Elliot is a very tight drummer, full of very tight drum fills, a lot like 1979 Supertramp stuff. How does he get his snare to sound so FAT yet so tight at the same time? That snare drum sound is insane. Of course alan poured his heart into recording and writing this album!!! I dont even know why there is an issue on this subject? I dont know why everyone hasnt already given this 5 stars? <BR>This album is funky and that Prophet5 Synthesizer is just crazy...
B0000CFWZA|5.0|I am the biggest critic for music and tend to review the c.d before buying it so when I picked up this c.d without getting the reviews I was a bit apprehensive but the wondering payed off! The long road is not their best c.d to date, but if your looking for good guitar rifts, wicked vocals and songs to screm along to then you have found your safe haven! The first single from the c.d - Someday is probley the weakest one of the bunch so don't assume the rest is along the same lines. Figured u out and Do this anymore are by far the best and Saturday night will have you rockin along with the band! The rest rocks and I have unfortunaly not been able to get the songs outta my head for sometime now! Pick it up NOW  and maybe well your there grab Silver SIde Up by far the best c.d to date! Oh and try to catch them in concert! Definatly worth the hard earned money!Canadians rule!

Hope U Enjoy My Review!
B00008J4P5|4.0|Well I was thinking of buying a good album but I was confused. I had heard of The White Stripes and also of other good albums. I was thinking of buying The White Stripes new album-Elephant or John Mayer or Radiohead or something. I thought that as I hadn't heard the White Stripes it could be my choice. However I needed recommendation. I knew it had been nominated for Album of the Year but still I wanted to read the reviews. I read one review here, which said that they (The White Stripes) were untalented and was a bunch of craps. I thought of dropping the idea but again I was looking forward to buy a rock album so I took the risk. And when I heard it I WAS SHOCKED.UNTALENTED? SAYS Who? They are Super talented. Man they, rock. The White Stripes is no Gorki's Zygotic Minki or Chicks on Speed-that is, bands that are so exotic that no one outside the art n architecture circuit has heard them. But that certainly isn't the case with ex-hubby n wife duo from Detroit a.k.a. The White Stripes. They're all over the place. But if there's one album that deserves the Strawberries, it is ELEPHANT. Elephant hits u like a hurricane in a mixer right from the start. It's a goulash of guitar-marauding rock, Led-heavy R&amp;B, garage punk and southern Blues.Meg on the drums plays John Bonham to Jack's masterful Mayhem (or seduction, depending on the song being played) and it's passion playtime from the moment we hear the rattlesnake riff of Seven Nation Army which is probably the best song of the album. The music recorded on an eight tack tape machine over a period of two weeks is blistering and the rawest `mainstream' mainstream album since the Stones' Exile on main street. The most traditional number is the snarling blues of Ball and Biscuit. There's a Robert Johnson tucked away inside, but he's sporting a Mohawk. Some of the great tracks are the hard rock and garage punk of There's no home for you here, The hardest button to button, Hypnotize, Black Math, The Air near my fingers andGirl, you have no faith in medicine. The slow numbers, I just don't know wat to do with myself, In the cold cold night, You've got her in your pocket and the humorous Well It's true that we love one another are also catchy. The other songs are rocking too.
0345451325|3.0|I was questioning reading this or not.  I had just finished Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six when I picked up The Fall of Reach, and must say I'm impressed.  There's plenty of action and suspense to keep even the biggest skeptic on the edge of their seats.  Unfortunately there's some problems with the book that really keep me from enjoying this the way it should be enjoyed<br />First and formost editing in this book is horrific.  There's typos all over the place, and for me to pick up on typos and gramatical errors is pretty big!  The UNSC becomes the USNC many times throughout the book, John goes from being a Petty Officer to Master Cheif to Petty Officer again within three paragraphs, sentence fragments are repeated several times within the same sentence breaking the sentence flow.  These might seem small, but there's so many in the first half of the book to really cause an annoyance.<br />Secondly, there's WAY too many holes left.  A lot is written about in the book that never comes to a conclusiona nd you're left questioning what happened and what the purpose was for this story<br />And lastly, there's little to no character development.  Names come up, but in the end that's all they are are names.  You never get emotionally attatched to anyone in the book, simply for the fact that they're too shallow of a character to grasp a hold of, even John, the main character.<br />This book is for true Halo fans, and for those that can look past the flaws mentioned above.  Like I said before, there's plenty of action and suspense, but with such numerous flaws I can only rate this book as subpar.
0380715430|4.0|I enjoyed this myself but I think the readership for this must mainly be people who are already interested in languages. It has rather a lot about such things as vowel shifts in English between fourteen hundred and fourteen fifty. To convert someone into a Bill Bryson addict I would turn them on with one of the travel books. One thing that carries over from his other books is the British/American comparison. He is a mine of information and insights about this. It's also the only language book I've read that fully covers the dirty words and cuss words.<BR>   I don't know how the experts feel about its accuracy. I note that he describes William Jones as English. His nationality is relevant because the fact that he was a Welsh speaker was one of the things that enabled him to recognize the relationships between the Indo-European languages. On that subject I take issue with Bryson's implied endorsement of the Economist's criticism of subsidizing Welsh. If you really want to eliminate useless relics of pre-Saxon Britain why not start with say Stonehenge. You could probably save the taxpayers millions of pounds. by bulldozing the place, putting a useful road through, and selling Salisbury Plain off to developers.<BR>    I don't know about the alleged thirty Inuit words for snow. I've seen that one debunked and confirmed. Maybe Inuit in Alaska have diffrent words from ones in East Greenland.
B00000K0T8|5.0|This album is straight fire! Personally, I think Ghostface is one of the better rappers of the Wu-Tang Clan and this debut album explains why. This is what you get here: typical hot Wu-style beats and Ghostface at his best. Ghostface is known for his quickly-spit, off-the-wall lyrics and that's what you get here. Ironman, along with Liquid Swords and Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, are the solo albums that proved Wu was for real. These 3 albums pretty much solidified their spot in hip-hop history. <br />I think every track is hot here, especially 260, Winter Warz, Fish, All That I Got Is You, Wildflower &amp; Iron Maiden. Thos are just my favorites off this album. I don't feel the need to ever skip any songs. <br />If you have heard any Wu-Tang albums, and you enjoyed Ghostface, than this album is for you. All I can say is, if you don't get a copy of Ironman, you are definitly missing out.
0385504209|1.0|I admit it, I read this book because of the hype.  I expected a deep book, with careful research.<br />What I got was a book of tin-foil hat conspiracies, weakly intertwined and excruciatingly thin characters.  The characters only exist to move along his poorly executed plot.<br />Dan Brown is a bad writer.  Worse, he's a lazy researcher.  I have no idea why this book is a best-seller.<br />It's impossible to care about any of the characters.  The plot is full of holes and improbabilities.  He makes amazing omissions.  He goes on through the entire book about how the church wanted to minimize women by limiting the role of Mary Magdeline, but avoids ever talking about Mother Mary.<br />It has an utterly predictable hollywood ending.<br />The most laughable thing about this BADLY written book it that people are now going around quoting its psuedo-history and made up theology as facts.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I GUESS THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTINA'S DISC EVER!!! SHE SHOWS HOW STRONG IS HER VOICE IN EVERY SONG BUT THERE ARE SOME SONGS THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE IN THE DISC:<BR>STRIPPED INTRO.

B0001I55OC|1.0|Well, I am the last one to say that a movie is bad because I look at movies for entertainment, not some deep purpose or meaning.  I must say that Timeline is BAD!  While bits and pieces of the movie are similar to the book, overall, this is one of the worst adaptations that I have ever seen.  The main point of the story is the only thing that even comes close to the book.  The rest of it, well, isn't even close.<BR>As far as entertainment value, I would have to say this movie has little.  The only saving grace is the battle scene at the end of the movie.  The rest of it was dry and very un-entertaining.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I CAN'T XPLAIN HOW AWESOME IS THIS DISC, CAUSE IN THIS ONE SHE MIXED MORE GENRES OF MUSIC SUCH R&amp;B, TECHNO, A LITTLE BIT OF REGGAE, HIP HOP, AND ALSO SHE HAD GREAT COLLABORATIONS 4 THIS DISC.<BR>ME AGAINST THE MUSIC: 10/10.

0613550757|5.0|There comes a time in everyone's life when it is necessary to read something that will provide you with serious intellectual stimulation. This is a book that will make you think about life though a whole different perspective. A book that will draw you in and force you to think about issues you may not have paid much attention to. Tuesdays with Morrie is full of insights, and wisdom. Morrie was the example of life that had meaning. This book will inspire you to become someone with purpose in life and make the most out of your life.Truly life changing.
020530902X|5.0|Writers can learn more per word of this small book than any other book I've read on writing (quite a few). It focuses on the practicalities rather than the mysteries of writing. If you follow this book's recommendations (or commands!), whatever you write will sound better. You may still need an editor; no one can take the hard work of thinking out of writing: in other words, you can't make up in style what you lack in thought.<br />So, think clearly and use this book when writing. Good results will ensue.
B0000035E7|4.0|For a debut, especially on such a small budget, this is really good.  It isn't at the same level as their later works so they can't be compared very well; but if I had to, it is most similar to the second half of Incesticide.  It shows Nirvana's roots in punky garage music.  I got this when I was about 12 and here it is ten years later and I still like it.  Sure, it's not heavy radio play material, but it's great for rockin' out in your car or cleaning the house or something.  <br />If you're a so-so Nirvana fan, listen mostly to the Best Of and Unplugged, this will probably not be your favorite and maybe you should save your cash (even though some songs from Unplugged are on this).  But if you're really into all their stuff you'll probably get into this.  But if that's true you most likely already have it.<br />Anyway, if all my CDs got stolen and I could only replace so many, I would get this again.
0385335482|5.0|If you've been anywhere close to any woman, you're gonna have fun with this book. Becky Bloom has a lot of what each and every woman has a little, a craving for shopping. She's constantly hiding from her bank manager, trying to find excuses for her credit card bills and, of course, lots of reasons to buy a new shirt (but every decent woman needs a classic white shirt, right?) If you ever heard yourself coming up with a fantastic excuse to buy a new pair of sandals (and a matching bag, obviously), you'll have the time of your life reading this book!
B00006LLOG|4.0|OK, I'm not here to further illuminate the highlights of this 70's classic, but to warn those who may be looking to replace their earlier CD release. Now, that version was muddy and lacking in presence, but, sadly, this &quot;remastered&quot; version isn't in anyway significantly better. Yes, there are the two previously unavailable demos included, and true completists will want to have this release just for them, but for those who hoped to rock out to a new and sonically improved Transformer, you'll be disappointed. The new liner notes are also kind of lame.
B00009RAJI|5.0|... Not that the original version of Rumours wasn't good enough in it's self, the WB people finally decided they needed to remaster this great artwork of an album into digital quality, and give Fleetwood Mac's loyal fans a bonus disc of roughs/outtakes/early demos/and jam sessions from the recording sessions.<br />   This is definetely one album that can NEVER be duplicated and the reissue of it proves that. It stands the test of time, no doubt.  The bonus material is the best part. You get to hear Nicks sing an early version of \\"Dreams\\" and hear her in the background say \\"alright second verse\\" before she sings. \\"Oh Daddy\\" from the outtakes on Disc 2 should've been the version they put on the album, Nicks' vocals are so loud and haunting, it almost becomes a duet with Christine McVie.<BR>   Also, \\"Silver Springs\\" the long lost (until 1997's reunion tour/CD) makes it's deserving spot not only on Disc 1 in the mix with the original remastered album cuts, but in rare outtake form on Disc 2 as well.<BR> Just when you thought Lindsey's guitar work couldn't get better, wait till you hear this. It is especially evident on the instrumental version of Never Goin Back Again (Brushes) on Disc 2. Now we all get to hear all the little parts that went into every song (without having DVD Audio 5.1 Surround)...things you never knew where even there.<br />  Thank You Fleetwood Mac and Warner Bros. for giving fans this great piece of history in digital form.
B00004XONN|5.0|The opening synth line of the album was the first thing people had heard of Radiohed in a couple years. The huge commercial success of OK Computer had drained the band, and what would seem like bussiness suicide, rleased no single,. promos, or any publicity before the LP hit stores. Radiohead judged their fans well, because Kid A still is their highest selling LP to date.<BR>In Kid A, Radiohead was not merely being musically weird to just be cool or &quot;post-modern&quot;, but it shows a true musical progression that represents the quintessential and apex of studio rock--after Kid A and her sister album, Amnesiac, a &quot;return to rock&quot; movement began, led by bands such as The White Stripes and The Hives, and Radiohead themselves said that their next LP (Hail to the Thief) would be a return to barer rock. Kid A is the Sgt. Pepper of this current cycle of musical progression, the peak of what their generation could produce experimentialy.<BR>Besides this historical and theorhetical significance, Kid A is one of the most enjoyable albums to experience. It is held together so well. My main complain with Amnesiac, is that it, Side A namely, does not hold together as well as  Kid A as a whole does. Be forwarned: as a Radiohead fan, it was the hardest for me to initialy absorb, but I can say now a s a music critic, that it is my favorite.<BR>Here is my track-by-track breakdown:<BR>1. ETIIRP-a shocking begining with a luring looped Thom repeating, &quot;yesterday i woke up sucking a lemon&quot; ad absurdum<BR>2. Kid A-the group's singer/songwriter once commented that this album was dedicated to the first cloned human baby. how apropos that the tilte track would feature a electronic voice singing an eirie, yet utterly bautiful lullybye. FYI, if you search online for a 2000 concert in Berlin, Radiohead plays a stunning live version of this song that proves that Radiohead didn't loose their musicianship when they went electronica<BR>3. TNA-have you seen the great Guy Ritchie movie, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels? the music in the chase scene sounds very similar to TNA's infectous bass riff. As Thom screams &quot;It's holding on!&quot;, horns and synth noises sound in a chaotic symphony<BR>4. HTDC-written during the OK Computer tours, this piece is about the presures of being a star, and wanting to just float down a muddy river<BR>5. Treefingers-Critics of Kid A say they dont like it because there are no guitars. This peice is nothing but guitars...cut up and patched samples of guitars, mind you. just listen to the whole thing, im sure you'll learn to like it<BR>6. Optomistic-probably the most accesible song on the album. the jam at the end is magnificant, and it leads perfectly into:<BR>7. in limbo- a perfect illustration of Radiohead experimenting with the emerging musical field of the aimbaint movment which involves layers of music to create a textured landscape aural experience.<BR>8. Ideoteque- a huge live favourite, this song is a fun spoof of dance club music. its lyrics are very Clash-esque apocyliptic: &quot;ice age coming, ice coming, women and children first&quot;<BR>9. Morning Bell- one of the most pleasurable songs, aural-aestheticaly, however, it is also one of the most violent Radiohead pieces lyricaly. the pumping organ and snare kicks are so delightful. the musical tension echos the lyrical theme at the line &quot;cut the kids in half&quot; with a change to a minor key. a very catchy but somber song.<BR>10. MPS-the masterpiece and tear-jerker of the album. it is a lovely ballad of a man who lost his loved one. for those who think Radiohead is a morbis and depressing band, i leave you with the fianl words of Kid A: &quot;I will see you in the next life&quot; (as a harp creates an image of ascending up to heaven)
6305232660|3.0|It is inevitable that these two movies be compared, and certainly the acting of Duvall, Freeman etc is superior in Deep Impact compared to Willis, et al, in Armageddon, but I feel Criterion has chosen the correct film to give it's special treatment to. The subplots are trivial in both, but they are just more entertaining in Armageddon. The \\"puppy love\\" story in Deep Impact could scarcely keep the interest of of anyone over age 20. The take on the \\"modern\\" astronauts having contempt for the space pioneer character of Duvall rings as false as anything in film. Current space explorers would react towards Shepherd/Armstrong/Glenn and company the way a young opera company would if Placido Domingo were suddenly assigned to their \\"team\\". Both films have essentially the same plot: go out to space and \\"nuke\\" a meteor before it annihilates humanity.... plan goes awry and self-less sacrifice at the last second saves the day. I just had more fun watching Armageddon, and movies should either entertain you or make you think. Since neither movie stimulated thought, I'll take Armageddon over DI.
B0000U5RO4|1.0|Rowan Atkinson is hilarous as Mr. Bean.  I could not stop laughing when I watched &quot;The Rat Race&quot;.  I was in the mood to laugh so I rented this movie.  After 20 minutes, I stopped watching it.  I found it to stupid.  The scene at the gravesight was to ridiculous for words.  After seeing the scene with Rowan trying to investigate how the thieves got away with the jewelry was just plain dumb.  I could not waste any more of my time watching this movie.
B000021Y77|5.0|From the opening credits where a swinging pendulum sets the pace, we hear a clock ticking, the beat of the music starts, and this movie never stops with its frenetic and frantic pace. It's a visual cacophony of different and exciting images that run at you around every corner to build in your brain faster and faster until the end of the movie. Phew. Then your heart is still racing from the experience and you want to see it again.<br />Run Lola Run is three films in one, yet, it's the same film time and time again, but it's vastly different that only the characters are the same. The story hit's you repeatedly and builds without repetition. Like each time Lola runs past a person in the street, you learn something new, sometimes funny and perhaps quirky about that person, and all within a few seconds, so by the end of the film it has been a complete encounter.<br />She is running to stop her boy friend from committing a crime. I'm sure I lost pounds just watching this girl run. She's beautiful and compelling. She's also hip and fit with red hair flying in the wind, a tight blue top revels a white bra underneath and her tight green pants flair at the bottom over black boots, definitely not running shoes. <br />This is a film like no other. It's so original that I would recommend it to literally anybody who is willing to suspend his or her belief in a liner world. <br />Run Lola Run is in German with subtitles but you hardly need to read much dialogue before the images tell the story for you.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is the best musical on broadway right now I have the show more times then I care to admit. The cd is worth every penny. Just listen to the samples and you will understand.
B000001FKY|2.0|When Pyromania came out it was a breath of fresh air.  In fact, even today that album sounds great.  However, I blame this album for great deal of the cheese factor of the 80's.  I know that it sold more copies than the bible but it really was a disappointing follow up.  It hasn't worn well with time, and while I can respect that some people love this album and its songs, I think it's fair for me to say that just hearing the phrase \\"Do you take sugar, one lump or two\\" gives me tremors.<br />(This review was edited to give two stars.  Some friends convinced me I wasn't being completely fair.  It gets an extra star for meaning so much to so many, whether or not I \\"get it\\" or not.)
6305313687|4.0|This is an excellent story staring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong as two brothes caught up in the skinhead movement of Southern California.<br />Norton's character, Derek, blames black drug dealers for the death of his father and uses this to further is white supremecist agenda.  He is helped by an aging skinhead who brainwashes teenagers in his belief system.  After Derek is sentenced to prison for murdering two black men, he experiences a change of heart.  Unfortunately, we in he is released, he realizes that his younger brother is now following the same path that he took.  He soon works on changing his brother's attitudes towards race.  <br />This is truly a hard-hitting drama that will rip at your belief system.  It would earn a perfect five stars from me, if not for the ending.  It seemed overly dramatic, unnecessary, and rushed.  If you rent this movie, you will know what I mean.<br />Overall, however, this is an excellent story and one that I highly recommend.
B000003TAW|5.0|This CD is superb. The melodies are simple, yet powerful and easily remembered. They soak their collective way into your mind and won't get out, which is definitely a good thing. After the tunes have penetrated your skull, you will be forced to go back and listen to this cd over and over, which is when it hits you with its true power: the lyrics. These songs aren't just catchy yet offbeat melodies, they are deep, emotionally wrenching, poetic epics that bring you along for a tempestuous and powerful journey.<br />The cd is excellent, but I cannot help but mention one particular song. This album's STUNNING finale, Only In Dreams, is one of the most breathtaking songs I have ever heard. It is beautiful, haunting, and epic all at once. It casts a soft, mild, beautiful spell over you at the beginning and forces you to stay with it bit by bit as it winds its way toward the absolutely infinite climax. It is a perfect song, and as much as I love Weezer, they never could duplicate the magnificence and power they captured in Only In Dreams. Listen, fall in love.
B000005RFQ|5.0|I Love this album (cd) don't get me wrong, Ozzy rules! but this is one of my favorite cd's. there is so much energy that flows from the music. i first bought this cd (it was a tape then) 18 years ago, and lost it not too much later. ever since, i have been looking for it everywhere and was totally unable to find it anywhere, to my dismay. i even asked at music stores if they were able to order it &amp; they were even unable to do that. recently, i was browsing a music site and saw that i could order this, i was ecstatic!! i immediatly  borrowed the necessary money and ordered it right then &amp; there. years ago, i even had the t-shirt &amp; i am still looking for that, so if you or someone you knowhas the shirt &amp; would like to sell it, email me at ericotway@hotmail.com pleeeeease!!

B0000AI44Q|5.0|at 19 i have witnessed only a fraction of neil youngs career. but with greendale it is time to admit, neil young is a genius. he has already reached a plateau in the world of rock where he can't be touched, a small category of people as many of these died young. whether it was the weed and honey i can't tell you but this album carries you away and leaves you feeling refreshed and eased by the knowledge that we have artists such as this to play to us. people inexperienced in neil youngs work might find this slightly inaccessible at first but keep listening and you'll fall in love. neil young fans will be pleasantly satisfied. thank you.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Haha, so funny...all those haters said Britney would vanish 2 or 3 years ago.  This album comes out and smacks them across their face.  Britney is alive and well, with her 2nd single &quot;Toxic&quot; having 4 #1's!
0385504209|2.0|This story began with great promise.  It appeared to be a non-stop type of novel.  About midway, however, it became clear that the author had a personal agenda to pitch.  When the plot ultimately degraded into a &quot;car chase&quot; I actually put it away for a month or so.  I finally finished reading the book this morning, and the ending is clearly designed for a B-Rated Hollywood film (Hmmm, maybe Richard Gere could play the lead role.)  This book went from great to a grating disappointment!
6305433909|5.0|Though there is room for improvement with regards to the story line, this movie delivers what I most enjoy in a film.  The acting is superb, including the minor cast roles.  The music is absolutely fantastic!...Lauren Hill and Ryan Toby steal the show with their voices.  The plot, though quite simple and predictable, is believable.  Many of the scenes are very moving, including the ending sequence involving Lauren Hill's character, Rita, and her mother.<br />Overall, this is a great family movie that everyone can enjoy.  The comedy is simple enough for children to understand, and there isn't one scene in the movie (that I can recall) which is inappropriate for all ages.  Like a few other reviewers, I've found that I long to hear a few of the songs from the movie when I need cheering up.<br />If you enjoy good, clean family movies, you can't go wrong with this one.

B0000VAFO0|2.0|In an unknown city, vampires and werewolves have been waging a battle that has lasted for thousands of years. The vampires are growing weaker and the werewolves are growing stronger which causes werewolf hunter and vampire, Kate Beckinsale, to suspect that something is brewing when she witnesses the werewolves chase after a human who may have something special about him. So this sitcom plot develops with bloodlines and bad guys turning good guys and good guys turning bad guys and the story just becomes a very tedious episode of Dallas as we learn more about the characters' roots and their connections with surprise twists like - \\"Bobby, I'm pregnant\\" or \\"J.R shot my dad\\". Underworld simply has no direction whatsoever. It is not until the last few minutes of the movie that all is revealed but by then you don't really care and are more than laughing at how seriously this film takes itself for all its ridiculousness.<br />Underworld looks good most of the time but the Matrix sound effects only bring the film's style down a notch. Neo and Trinity with fangs this is not. As a competitor to films like Dark City and The Crow it doesn't even touch on the plot or gothic look of these movies. The dream sequences in Underworld are directly ripped from the same effect as Frodo seeing the eye when he puts on the ring of power. Now and again blaring plot holes surface that slap you across the face. Vampires have reflections? A lot of the film does not make sense.<br />So how does it work out in terms of popcorn fodder? Well Blade or Blade II is certainly leaps and bounds ahead of this one. Underworld kept my attention for all of it, but still I think I have forgotten most of it by the time I came to write this review. It is simply a no-brainer with elements that you have all seen too many times before. I like the whole vampire meets werewolf scenario but Underworld just misses everything that may have been good about it. If you want to see vampires and werewolves in the same movie then go rent Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) instead.<br />Underworld is simply under-nourishing, under-par and underestimated what audiences expected to see. Only for rainy nights when there is nothing else to do.e then go rent Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) instead.<br />Underworld is simply under-nourishing, under-par and underestimated what audiences expected to see.

B0000D96NW|5.0|Like Metallica, Machine Head's roots lie in fantastic, crushing Thrash Metal. Like Metallica, Machine Head decided to change the direction of their music, which turned out to be a disaster.<br />However, unlike Metallica, Machine Head have fallen and risen again. Whereas Metallica's 2003 effort was a their worst yet, with awful sound quality and definite Nu-Metal leaning, Machine Head's latest is by far their joint best album, along with their debut Burn My Eyes.<br />THey have returned to their original sound but with added clean vocals, and it's the return of Machine Head solos, chugging, heavy riffs and brilliant tempo changes mid song. Machine Head are once again my favourite band.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|3.5 stars more like...I saw this movie in the theatre first with a Japanese friend (incidently he did not find this movie racist in the least, a lot of the &quot;stereotypes&quot; are true--arcade scene/&quot;Johnny Carson&quot; talk show; conversely there are a lot of American &quot;stereotypes&quot; throughout the movie as well that are mocked).  And there are several parts throughout it which are hilarious (anything involving the whiskey commercials--especially the Roger Moore bit).  There were occasional parts in the movie that were slow and tedious, but frequently the acting smoothed over some of these slow parts.<br />Character development appears to be a strong point in Coppola's writing.  She did an incredible job with the two main characters, of course.  But even some of the side characters were well developed (e.g., the stereotypical ditz--based on Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johannson character's husband, even Bob Harris' wife--who didn't show up at all on screen were well put-together).<br />Overall a decent movie, I've watched it a couple times, and it does get better.  Not for people who don't like movies carried by character dialog...
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is a must have for anybody who considers themselves a music fan.  This DVD gives a look at Zeppelin during all phases of their career, from a 1969 radio show to a live performance in 1979 (one year before Bonham died).  The White Summer and Moby Dick alone are worth the cost of this item; the other four and a half hours are just the icing on the cake.  Do yourself a favor and buy this.
B000001FY9|5.0|This CD is one of his best. This is actually my 2nd time replacing the CD. The first one was &quot;borrowed&quot; from me, without my knowledge and the second one mysteriously dissapeared from my car. I tell you, it's a hot commodity. I plan to hold on to this one though. This is the first of the 17 Bob Marley CD's I own and I would definitely replace it again if I had to.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I just saw the show last Friday and it was amazing. I have never seen anything so awe inspiring. It was refeshing and showed and interesting view into the lives of the characters as well as human behavior. The show mixes comedy, romance, satire, and tragedy so weel that you could be intears one moment and laughing the next. It was absolutely amazing. As for the soundtrack, I haven't stopped listening to it for the past week. It is amazingly addictive and lively. The songs, \\"Defying Gravity\\", \\"What is this Feeling\\", and \\"Popular\\" and refreshing and fun. On the more serious side, \\"Something Bad\\", \\"As Long as You're Mine\\", and \\"No Good Deed\\", give insight into the relationships and plots of the show. The show is a must see, and the album is a MUST BUY.

B0000TLA9G|4.0|This is the greatest hits compilation that Axl and Slash (unsuccesfully) sued Geffen Records over, in an effort to prevent its release. Among the reasons Axl stated: (1) Geffen had not consulted them in the track-listing (note to Axl and Co.: Geffen OWNS the rights to these tracks!); and (2) releasing this album would \\"endanger\\" the release of the long-awaited new album \\"Chinese Democracy\\" (I haven't laughed that hard in a long time!).<br />In any event, \\"Greatest Hits\\" (14 tracks, 79 min.) is indeed a flawed compilation that nevertheless contains some great music. Not enough emphasis is given to \\"Appetite for Destruction\\", with only 3 tracks (no \\"Mr. Brownstone\\"?), and too much emphasis is given to \\"The Spagetti Incident\\" (2 tracks, including the out-of-context \\"Since I Don't Have You\\") and to cover songs (5 of the 14 tracks on here are covers). \\"Use Your Illusion I and II\\" rightfully provide half of the album's songs, even if \\"November Rain\\" is as self-absorbant and bombastic as ever. This compilation is noteworthy for the inclusion of the (so-so) cover of \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" which appeared on the \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" soundtrack, and now appears for the first time on a GnR release.<br />Liner notes are skimpy, and this does smell of a quick money job, but frankly, can you blame Geffen? The label has been waiting TWELVE YEARS on the new studio album, and at this point do you really believe that \\"Chinese Democracy\\" will ever see the light of day? I'm not holding my breath... Meanwhile, this will satisfy the many out there that simply want GnR's best known songs (which are not necessarily their best songs) on a single CD.
B0001JXQEM|4.0|Considering the $30 price and the potential 160 minutes of available digital media space, I was expeciting to be really wowed and knocked out by the package.  It's good, but not the best it could've been.<BR>The first disc sounds good, but only marginally better than my original disc.  I don't know why they didn't think younger audiophiles wouldn't appreciate a dually-playable SACD version of this (as is the deluxe Who's Tommy), but the difference doesn't hit you that hard.  And I was rather miffed that they used the latter-version of the album with the remixed Say It Ain't So, although they include the original on the bonus disc.<BR>The bonus disc is okay, although the b-sides were quite accessible all along.  The newer, rare demos are the best treat of the discs.  And notably missing is the original \\"fuzz\\" mix of Suzanne, so don't go selling your import singles off just yet.<BR> <BR>The packaging is very nice, with handwritten lyrics for the whole album and the b-sides, and some nice pics (sometimes too small to appreciate). <BR>On a whole, this is okay, gives a greater enhanced glimpse of a fresh new band who're still on top today.  Perhaps a cheaper, single disc version would've been more appropriate, and cost effective.  Definetly get the DVD, too.<BR> <BR>I would greatly encourage the Weezer fans to push Geffen for a deluxe version of Pinkerton, with all the b-sides on the first disc and a full live 1996 show on the second disc, when they played the entire Pinkerton album in its entirety.

B000002KET|5.0|For a very long time, 1974's _Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath_ was my absolute favorite Black Sabbath album. However, the previous effort _Volume 4_ has grown on me so deeply over the years, that it's now become sort of a tugowar between these two.<br />From the beginning, Sabbath always seemed to counterbalance hard-hitting, sludgy numbers with mellow, sedate pieces. So, it's probably not as big of a stretch to find that Sabbath did this with subsequent albums: (in Sabbath's case at least) it was probably not so much a change, as much as it was an evolution - if there's any distinction between the two. _Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath_ is probably Black Sabbath's pinnacle - either this or _Volume 4_, I'd say. It displays a combination of sludgy hard rock, orchestrated rockers and even some jazzy aesthetics can be spotted in certain tracks. It's a very diverse album.<br />Some of the songs. The title track is probably my all-time favorite Sabbath track. The slow, surging, acidic (and equally beautiful and melodic) wall-of-noise that spurts from Tony Iommi's guitar blends perfectly with Ozzy Osbourne's beautiful, utterly multi-faceted wail -- and vice versa. I always thought that Ozzy Osbourne's voice was a powerful instrument amongst itself. Not too many people seem to like his voice, which is understandable, but I've always saw beauty in it. &quot;Fluff&quot; is probably my favorite Tony Iommi instrumental. A sedate, peaceful, earthy, wispy piece in some multiple of three, with gentle arpeggios, beautiful, wispy, soothing chords (e.g. D, Gmaj7, Gmaj7/E etc.), and later, an atmospheric pillow of sound comprised of overdubbed guitar parts and keys decorate the song in quite a lovely fashion. &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; gives the title track a run for it's money in terms of my all-time favorite Sabbath song. This is a tasty monster. Iommi's bluesy electric lines are as tasty as ever, and so is Bill Ward's drumming. This track features something that may be a bit peculiar - some strange rhythmic ideas. The verses could well be in 4/4, but a tricky thing seems to be happening: the motifs would appear to be in 6/4 (12/8) due to the placement of the crash cymbal, along with the repeat (and placement) of the motif's beginning. After the first four beats, a strange, snaky, ascending-descending-ascending melodic line appears over the next two beats, while Ward is doing the kind of creative bass-and-snare drum fill that most drummers would do to close out a time signature. After that little fill, the crash cymbal appears, and the beginning of the main motif is repeated. Thus, making one believe that this (four fourths, plus two fourths) is in 6/4. However, closer inspection will reveal that after this, two more fourth-beats appear before the motif is actually fully completed. Then, this whole motivic pattern (4 + 4[4+2=6+2] = 8 quarter notes) appears again before Ozzy's vocals come in: only this time, during his vocals, there are no tricky rhythmic and/or accent placements -- at least not from Bill Ward during the second repeat of Ozzy's vocals. I'm not sure how it's all set up in exact terms, but I find it pretty darn nifty. But, even with all that stuff aside, this track smokes. Later, Yes' Rick Wakeman gives us some synthesizer sweeps, along with some jazzy keyboard licks, which give this track a bit of an extra kick - an added dosage of flavor. &quot;Who Are You&quot; is a trippy, almost psychedelic-like track drenched in synths, and Ozzy's tripped-out vocals. I love this track: it's very trance-inducing. &quot;Spiral Architect&quot; is the orchestral-rock track of the album. It's almost tear-inducing in it's beauty, melody, and the way Ozzy delivers his vocal.<br />This is a classic in Sabbath's catalog -- right up there with _Paranoid_, _Master of Reality_ and _Volume 4_. Metal purists may react to it in lukewarm fashion (or worse), but give it time to grow on you. It had to grow on me, and it's possibly my favorite from them (as mentioned in theopening paragraph.) In a word: classic.opening paragraph.) In a word: classic.
0517122707|1.0|Is it possible to award negative stars??? I just can't understand how/why this book won the Pulitzer, or has any kind of following at all. Why anyone could possibly care about the characters is beyond me. I tried and tried to read it, and finally gave up about 2/3 of the way through. <br />I normally LOVE southern fiction (Carson McCullers, Walker Percy, etc.) and really expected to like this, but it was pretentious, annoying, and most galling of all, amateurish. A total waste of paper, and of time if you actually manage to read the whole thing. Absolutely abysmal.
0385504209|1.0|I have already reviewed this book, but I have just remembered what is perhaps one of the most important inaccuracies of this book.<br />It says that the Divine name (YHVH) is taken from Jehovah, a combination of some male God's name and eve, however it is the other way around.<br />Around 400BC the jews stopped saying the divine name, saying 'Adonai' (my lord) or 'ha-shem' (the name) instead. Now, hebrew is written without vowels, so around 1000AD the Masorites (jewish monks) put in vowel points because they realized that hebrew was dying out as spoken language, so they added vowels so that people would still be able to read and pronounce the words of the tanakh (kind of like the Old Testament...same books, differant order. Refers to Torah (law), Nevi'im (prophets), and Ketuvim (writings)) When they came across the divine name, they had a dilema, someone reading the Tanakh out loud may accidentally say the name outloud, defying 1400 year convention and rabbinic law. They had a simple solution, they did not put in the vowels for YHVH (modern reconstruction would say that it was originaly most likely 'Yahveh') but rather added the vowels for 'adonai' making Y+a+h+o+v+a+h = yahovah, this is an unpronouncible word in hebrew (two sylable word, because the 'o' is frequently not written, the first vowel is whats called a 'vocal sheva' something which cant be alone in a sylable-take my word for it) so anyone reading would say 'Hey! I can't pronounce that, must be ha-shem'. So jews (being intelligent people-I'm a christian by the way, we are the 'dumb' ones) knew not to say it, but in 1000-1500AD period, christian (german) monks came across it and without pause, with no regard for the language, simply said 'Jehovah' while I imagine the jews just looked on either shaking their heads or laughing hilariously.<br />So there you have it! The Christians invented the name Jehovah, it's not our God's name after all! Plus, Jehovah came out of YHVH, not the other way round, this male god plus eve stuff is nonsense.<br />So, if you've read to this point, congratulations, you have had an actual history lecture, perhaps Dan Brown should read. If I have inspired you to learn Hebrew, good! It's a great language, I love it, makes Greek look so silly.god plus eve stuff is nonsense.<br />So, if you've read to this point, congratulations, you have had an actual history lecture, perhaps Dan Brown should read.

B00004STUL|4.0|By the mid-nineties, the buddy cop action flick was not a new idea. Starting with 48 Hours and continuing with movies like Beverly Hills Cop and Lethal Weapon, the &quot;cat and dog in a barrel&quot; concept had been fairly played out. However, in 1995, a new director and some rising stars teamed up with the movie veterans behind Top Gun to create a new breed of action movie.<br />In Bad Boys, wild card narcotics officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) are in a bind. Their career dope bust has just been robbed from the station, and their only hope of finding it is the witness to a murder. However, circumstances get complicated when the two are forced to switch roles, and family man Marcus has to become swinging bachelor Mike for 72 hours.<br />The plot of the movie is fairly weak, centering around the drug bust and the cops' efforts to protect the witness, find the dope, and (shock and awe) keep Internal Affairs off their backs. However, the plot is not the reason to see the movie. For the reason, just look to the stars.<br />The same spirit of banter and hen-pecking that made the Lethal Weapon series so enjoyable is given a fresh coat of paint, and a couple of fresh voices. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence snap, crackle, and explode on screen, whether their shooting the bad guys or just firing pot shots at each other. While Lethal Weapon showed us the friction between a fresh pair of partners, Bad Boys shows us two cops who have been together six years, and know just how to get on each other's nerves.<br />But even with the snappy humor that Lawrence and Smith bring to the screen, the movie rides on wheels of action. Micheal Bay has become synonymous with action movies, and Bad Boys is the reason why. In his directorial debut, Bay uses swift camera moves, scenic pans, and judicious slow motion, fusing elements of John Woo and MTV to create a fresh take on gunplay and car chases. Although he lacks Woo's finesse in creating bullet ballets, Bay definitely knows how to keep a film's pace going, and Bad Boys does just that.<br />Sure, the movie's not perfect. The plot is sometimes laughably flawed, and the real Miami PD wouldn't put with half the crap that Smith and Lawrence pull, but the movie is enjoyable nontheless, focusing on character conflict and balls-out adrenaline to keep the audience entertained. Combined with a solid cast of character actors (Joe Pantoliano ROCKS), and Bad Boys is summer entertainment at its funnest.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Ok, so I'd heard mixed reviews of Avenged Sevenfold (A7X) for about three weeks before I bought this. All I have to say is, BEST $15 I'VE SPENT SINCE SHADOWS FALL - ART OF BALANCE!<BR>I'll start with the vocals and lyrics. First of all, YES there are some EMO songs here. About broken relationships ect. but they're not ALL EMO and the ones that are; are pretty darn good!<BR>&quot;Dark in their hearts,<BR>I can feel it burn inside of me<BR>Tormented young with no souls, haunting me<BR>Pain in their lives all they know is misery<BR>Take these chains away that are holding me down&quot;<BR>-- Avenged Sevenfold - Eternal Rest<BR>Yep, the guy who said all their songs were whinny emo stuff obviously didn't LOOK or LISTEN to the lyrics.<br />Avenged Sevenfold uses a very good mixture of harsh screaming vocals and very good clean voices.. I compare clean voices to Thrice and harsh ones to maybe In Flames, but really there is no comparison. These vocals are very original and you can sing a long to the chorus without hurting your throat.<br />As far as guitar riffs. They're very good, for a band making this sort of music they also pull off Guitar solos VERY well. The general riffs are intense and flow very well, amongst  the best out there period!<br />I would say the ONLY drawback to this CD is that I didn't find it sooner.<BR>If you like hardcore or metal or just heavier music BUY THIS ONE!
B00013F38K|1.0|Don't buy this DVD!!!  Send a message to the corporate geniuses who decided to &quot;chop&quot; the top and bottom of what was originally shown for no apparent reason.  There is no excuse for not making this DVD the best it could have been.  Either show it in it's original format as was shown on TV or add-in the the additional widescreen image.  To cut out footage is a crime.<br />This was one of my favorite shows from the past, but I cannot recommend it because of the DVD flaws.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|If some, as they say, have only watched half the movie, why do they think they have the ability to review it? I usually expect good reviewers to at least read the whole book or listen to the whole piece of music? Is that so unreasonable.<br />I've seen &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; three times now, and it gets better with every viewing. You see more things the more you look at it. Those who did not like it should at least try getting to the end at least once. Then they might have something more worthwhile to say than &quot;So boring I chewed my foot off.&quot;
B00018D44U|2.0|The point of trying new things is to progress as an artist, but I felt very little progression on Norah's part.<br />The lyrics have regressed, the spirit I heard in her voice and tone in her first album, lost.<br />This CD felt more a response to mass market appeal. Norah is catering to a new segment that subjectively is beyond me - country. Some people may think of a duet with Dolly Parton as artistic, but hardly do.<br />Hopefully in her next album she will return to the spirit of thought she evoked before - that of a wistful loneliness, of the murky depths of a dim nightlife, and build on that.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I keep reading that the Coppola name is all that got this movie made or praised or given awards. <br />If that's the case would anyone like to point out why Francis Ford Coppola himself hasn't been able to make a decent movie in 20 years or get a budget for anything that's not commercial, or win awards lately, or why &quot;One from the Heart&quot; was ripped to shreds by critics, or why he lost his studio? Or why he's never made a movie as sensitive as this one? Could they point out why even Spielberg's duds like &quot;Always&quot; or &quot;1941&quot; didn't get success just on the name?<br />It takes more than a name. For a big movie, marketing will sell it because the studio won't dare to lose money and will pour the advertising bucks in. For a small movie, marketing can't do that. No studio's going to spend 40 million in marketing on a movie that only cost 4.<br />That's how the biz works. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; got made because it made sound commercial sense to make it as its current popularity and profitability show. Thank God that it also made superb artistic sense!
B00018D44U|2.0|Reminds me of watered down beer at a night bar - as opposed to the night bar itself. A bit disappointing, a bit too light, and a bit sour... and mostly overall, just not authentic. I rather listen to Diana Krall.
0385504209|3.0|I took this book with me on a business trip, wanting something interesting and easy to read.  For probably the first third, I couldn't get through it fast enough.  But about mid-way, as some of the plot points started to reveal themselves, disappointment set in.  The puzzles started to remind me of &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; -- fit together just a bit neatly.  The structure of the book began to annoy me -- climaxes at the end of every short chapter.  I found the prose style irritating and almost amateurish, but I suppose the author may have been using a style that I'm just not a fan of -- at least, unlike many novelists these days, he used punctuation!  The big plot payoffs, for example what exactly it was the heroine saw her grandfather doing in the basement all those years ago, weren't worth the buildup.  And (this is a sort of a spoiler, so don't read further if you haven't read the book!) are you telling me that this prominent family's true name was never discovered?  Well, on that topic I may have missed something -- by the end of the book I confess I wasn't paying the closest attention.  I found the ultimate resolution a huge letdown.  It's not a terrible book -- but it's probably best suited to a paperback edition at the beach.
B00003CXGG|1.0|I have never really been a Jet Li fan. I think he's to one dimensional and he's always the though guy. Not only that, he uses wires in virtually all of his action sequences. When I started to watch this film, i was going to watching it as if i've never seen a Jet Li film before. But my opinion eneded up the same. It was a bad movie, with bad acting and average action sequences. It was just a macho movie, with no point. If you want a martial arts film with all the stunts done without wires and where it's fun and exciting, get a Jackie Chan flick (although his recent couple of films have had obvious wire stunts in them, he is 50 yoou know). Jackie Chan is the best action star there is, was, and ever will be. If you want quality, get Jackie Chan. Garbage, get Jet Li.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Finally, after years of waiting, a Guns N Roses \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation has been released. The big question being asked is \\"Was it worth the wait?\\". Well, the answer is \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\" at the same time.<br />On the positive side, \\"Greatest Hits\\" includes nearly all of GnR's best known classics from the party-rock anthems \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", \\"You Could Be Mine\\" and \\"Paradise City\\" to the epic masterworks \\"November Rain\\" and \\"Civil War\\" to the simple balladry of \\"Patience\\", \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"Yesterdays\\". The band's cover of The Rolling Stones \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" (originally released on the \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" soundtrack) makes its debut on a GnR album here as well.<br />The downside to this compilation is that there are some glaring omissions which lead to one wishing that this were a double-disc set. GnR classics such as \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", \\"My Michelle\\" and especially the epic \\"Estranged\\" are missing from this CD entirely. Understandably, GnR did not have enough hits to fill an entire double-CD but it would have been nice to have had the above tracks included along with important album tracks.<br />All gripes aside, \\"Greatest Hits\\" offers a fairly good sampling of the music Guns N Roses is best known for. There is plenty of great classic tracks on this disc to bring back fond memories of what this band once was.<br />Not bad at all.
B00018D44U|1.0|Now here's an artist that has been praised and given the whole song-and-dance treatment by the media, but regardless of who you are, you are bound to be disappointed by the finished product.<br />Norah Jones's follow-up to her inexplicably huge-selling debut Come Away With Me is filled with more of the same - smooth jazz-pop with tepid arrangements and lyrics with little effort put into them, almost as if they were an afterthought - basically it's good for background music at a formal dinner or as treatment for insomnia but that's it.<br />The difference between this album and the last are hints of country music, which come off as totally contrived and as an attempt to appeal to a different audience, rather than the authentic article.  This is what happens when the critics give an undeserving artist too much praise - they believe their own hype and are lazy about their own craft.<br />Norah Jones is a competent pianist, but lacking as a vocalist and songwriter - the better material is written by someone other than her.  Maybe she will live up to the hype if she puts some serious effort into her next recording, becomes a better writer and singer, and starts performing songs that are more unique and original - not songs that sound like Diana Krall leftovers.
B000056NX4|5.0|This was GREAT! It's been years since I watched the original (Ahhhhh, the memories........) and I must say that this re-make was superbly done. Glenn Carter's voice as JC had great powerful vocals! Renee Castle did a fantastic job as Mary Magdaline and her voice was AWESOME! (as was Judas') I especially liked the fact that they updated the staging to fit into today's times! The leather and vinyl clothing were a GREAT touch to this production! All the costumes were FANTASTIC! The story concept, music and lyrics are the same as they were in the original but brought more up-to-date. I recommend this version to ANYONE that HAS SEEN the original, would LIKE to see the movie, or SHOULD see this movie. Even my pre-teen and teenagers enjoyed this version! FIVE STARS ALL AROUND!!
B00005JN1L|3.0|(...)I made the mistake of reading reviews before going to see this movie and ended up knowing the ending before I even sat down. This totally took away from the entire movie...I found myself seeking faults in the story line rather than enjoying the movie. STOP HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE...<br />The movie was just OK, to me...It's hard not to like a Johnny Depp movie and I couldn't even remember the name of the actual movie...just that it was that Johnny Depp movie...The ending was predictable, then again, when you know the ending going in it kind of ruins things for you. The movie did keep you entertained however, it was difficult to believe that plagerism would drive a person to stalk someone...and this premise was what was supposed to keep the movie-goer interested.<br />The Shoot-her concept in the film was kind of lost on me...If the idea was that the personality was derived from the idea of shooting his wife, why didn't he SHOOT her a the end?<br />See in theaters?- Sure, why not...<BR>Rent?-Definitely<BR>See again?-No<BR>Buy on DVD?-No
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had been hounded for a long time to check out this cancelled tv show, and I'm glad I finally did. It's set in the future, and combines &quot;space opera&quot; with a sort of &quot;western&quot;. I know it sounds a little odd, but it works so well it's frightening. I'm not going to ramble on about this show, I'll just say that I've never seen a tv show cast work so well together, making characters that feel like extended family. If you haven't seen Firefly, BUY IT NOW. Otherwise you will be doing a disservice to yourself. It's that good.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|When I bought this CD, I thought I was going to be introduced to a band in the same vain as The Strokes, AC/DC, or Buck Cherry, what I got was a band that is overly produced and obviously commercial. Normally production is a good thing, but when it takes the raw emotion out of most of the tracks it is highly detrimental, Jet should have consulted a producer such as Raphael Gordon or Terry Date, even Rick Rubin or Mike Clink would have really brought this band out, unfortunately, we get a less than par album that sounds like a bunch of wannabes.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah is a paradigm to me in that she is not a great singer, but she is a very entertaining artist. To be honest I bought this album not expecting much, however, I was pleasantly surprised. Soft, soothing melodies crossed with her cool, husky voice make for an extremely laid-back \\"Sunday Afternoon\\" feeling treat that all types of people can enjoy.<br />While I enjoyed the jazzy \\"Don't Know Why,\\" the real treat here is the ethereal \\"Come Away With Me.\\" This title track just sweeps the listener away into a beautiful place; in fact, when I listen to the song I imagine a setting like something out of \\"Under the Tuscan Sun.\\" This song alone makes the album worth the buy.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|this cd rocks. Ain't It Fun has to be the best song on the cd. i love it. the packageing is really cool. this will hold me until the release of the soon to be greatest album of all time CHINESE DEMOCRACY. BUY THIS CD.
B00018D44U|5.0|\\"Come Away With Me\\" was a wonderful album, although not worthy of all the Grammys it picked up, but enjoyable. However, with this album Norah was shed her old skin for a much more \\"folksy\\" sound that is music to my ears (but I get the feeling that others do not agree based on its rating). \\"Sunrise\\" is a more upbeat, but still soft, follow-up to \\"Come Away With Me,\\" and may, in fact, be better. I will say, though, that the duet with Dolly \\"Creepin' In,\\" may have been a little over the top.<br />All in all, a step in the right direction.
B00012QM86|5.0|I was so moved by this movie. I have seen it 6 times &amp; yet to tire of it. Perfection!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is great sexy stuff! I loved thid CD from the start to the end and there aren't any fillers at all! Quite unexpected and refreshing music. Good pop and rnb. She's worked with some good producers and people like Madonna and Ying yang twins for a great result!
B0001ADB8C|5.0|This music is about melody, beauty, outstanding guitar craft, and escaping from the world of illusion. George Harrison was always dissed by the muzo press because he told the truth about himself, them and the whole slimy music biz. This is REAL music. <br />I agree with Music Fan from mid-Atlantic USA about the skimpy liner notes - it's funny that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (David Fricke writes for them) always slaughtered Harrison's music after &quot;Material World&quot; - now they love him! The liner notes that guy wants to read are in the book &quot;The Music Of George Harrison&quot; by Simon Leng.
076790592X|5.0|I'm just another student who had the will to read this book but never got around to it until I was assigned to, and I am so glad for that.  Reading this book has helped to release a little piece of Morrie that's inside myself.  Morrie offers a perspective on life that is completely different from the self-centered, self-serving one we encounter every day.  &quot;Invest in the human family.  Invest in people.  Build a little community of those you love and who love you.&quot;  Most of all, though, Morrie encourages us to accept love and kindness from others, and not be afraid to dish it out as well.  READ THIS BOOK and then join my little community!
B0001US8EO|5.0|At last Warner Bros. has seen fit to release Kasdan's masterpiece on DVD. Sadly and inexplicably this movie was overlooked at the time of it's release. This superbly written,beautifully played piece is the definitive account of the life of a western archetype achieving everything that previous Earp accounts have failed to with the possible exception of Hour Of The Gun. Avoiding the ludicrous romanticism of My Darling Clementine, or the appaulingly laughable Lancaster/Douglas fiasco, Gunfight At OK Corral, Kasdan's portrayal presents these characters as the contradictory individuals they undoubtedly were and the actors and actresses do a tremendous job of bringing them to life. Costner is utterly believable as a complex man who, influenced by his father's belief in the family unit, almost destroys the very family he is trying to protect. We see him go from an idealistic young man to becoming a resolute, serious individual as a result of circumstances often beyond his control which serve to form his hardened personality and tunnel vision. Dennis Quaid is superb as Doc Holliday and presents a real person rather than Val Kilmer's amusing charicature in the over rated t.v movie-quality Tombstone. JoBeth Williams, Catherine O'Hara and Isabella Rosselini are great in their portrayals of the role of women in the west. Each of the actresses in this movie portrays a distinctly different character never resorting to cookie-cutter characterisations but the one thing they all have in common is, true to the period, women were expected to be supportive but not to have minds of their own; No revisionist western this.<BR>  Technically the movie looks and sounds great. Kasdan creates a visual style without being heavy handed and we are presented with a west in various stages of development from shanty towns to the developing, lawless Dodge City and Tombstone where law and order are trying to take hold even when the \\"law\\" is being enforced in a very subjective manner, again there is alot of gray in this movie.<BR>  Finally I have to praise James Newton Howard for his wonderful score which, if it were isolated on the DVD would make this a 6 star release.<BR>  Apparently deleted scenes are being included on a second disc. An expanded lazer disc was released some years ago which restored this footage to the film, adding even more depth to the characters and as a result an even better movie.<BR>  Please buy this movie and, in doing so, encourage Warner's to release the expanded version in the near future. You will not be disappointed.
076790592X|5.0|Tuedays With Morrie was such an aweosme book, that every adult should read.  Dying shouldn't be a word we fear, but a word we embrace.  Morrie discusses all aspects of life, and the way he sees life as a dying man.  The words that come out of Morrie's mouth is so inspirational, calming, and intellectual.  He knows how to approach things, and isnt afraid to approach them.  His words are unforgettable.  This book will bring out a whole new way to look at life and death.  It's a must read book.  This is one of those quiet yet unbelievable books.  Go out and read it!!
B00003CXB4|5.0|We have all seen The Lion King but let me tell you you haven't seen it like this before!<BR>When the movie came out Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound was new and they did the surround like everyone was doing at the time, make it sound like there is an orchestra in front of you, center speaker for voices, rear speakers sparingly used here and there.<BR>Now for the DVD they went back and completely re-did the surround sound in a special Disney Mix (the original 5.1 mix is still selectable), it now sounds like you are sitting in the middle of an orchestra, and all speakers are used in a way like never before. If you just got surround sound and want to test it out or have had a system for a while and want to put it to the ultimate test, this dvd is for you.<br />The music is larger than life, and if a tear doesn't come to your eye in the opening scene with the &quot;Circle of Life&quot; song, you are not human. Are you a robot? Do you have special powers? Please use them for good.
B00018D44U|5.0|I bought this album without even listening to any of her current singles, but I was definitely not dissapointed. Her music is instantly warm, welcoming, and easy to listen to. Whether she's singing about love lost, love found, or just life; her voice has that rare ability to make me feel like I am a part of it, and you never feel like it's too much or too little. Truly one of today's most promising music artists.
0385336810|5.0|I am a huge Sophie Kinsella fan - as are many of us.  I mean - who hasn't read at least ONE of the \\"Shopaholic\\" books?  Everyone has... so, we know Kinsella's work.  Her new book \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" takes us on a new adventure with Emma Corrigan, you feel the same sense of fun, intelligence and spunk as you did with Becky Bloomwood.  <br />Emma truly believes her life is right on track.  She has a (fairly) enjoyable job, good boyfriend, and good friends.  Everything is good.  Settled.  Well - an unexpected good awful flight has her in a tizzy and that's where things begin to go pear-shaped.  Emma uses this opportunity to spill her guts to a very attractive stranger sitting next to her --- of course you (as the reader) know this is no random man and things are going to come back to haunt Miss Emma.  The good thing is - Emma doesn't.  And, that's what makes this book so much fun.  It's light, fun and really fun.  I loved all the work settings and the backstabbing and naughtiness of it.<br />Great new book from one of my favorite author... I thrilled its finally available in the States (I read it ages ago from AmazonUK).  I think those who loved \\"Shopaholic\\" will be happy with this new offering. <br />Cheers!
0440234743|2.0|I didn't care for this book. It would have been much more interesting if it were two thirds the size. I mean, we GET IT ALREADY...that's one big SWAMP!<br />But the main problem with The Testament is the weak character of Rachel Lane Porter. Grisham is not a good portrayer of women and he lives up to his standard here. Rachel is a flat, trite, unsympathetic dolt who would rather paddle her own leaky canoe to &quot;help my people&quot; than use 5 billion dollars to HELP her people! I don't get it, why is this shortsighted swampy martyr worth considering as an inspiration to Nate or anybody else? Turning down money that would seriously help lobby for, treat, preserve and protect Brazilian Indians just because,&quot;I didn't earn the money&quot; is a devise a fifth grader wouldn't design for a character. Does Grisham really think the reader will be touched by this nut?<br />Rachel's mysterious hospital visit is a useless devise. What's the point of the secrecy? Who cares? So she can slip into a smelly ward unseen, stroke Nate's head and HEAL HIM, then disappear with no trace...what's the point? If Grisham meant to bestow miraculous powers on &quot;Our Lady of the Swamp&quot;, he didn't follow up on it.<br />This weak character reminds me of the equally vague and pointless young female clerk in &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot; The personalities are different, but their purpose and character development are equally questionable. Why are they in the plot, why weren't they developed, and why were they dropped abruptly and without the slightest concern one way or the other by the reader? <br />Like I said, Grisham doesn't understand women and employs female characters as disposable accessories to his central themes, never exploring or utilizing them effectively.<br />It is true that Rachel leaves the money for good stuff (by default at her death), but here again,why didn't she leave the will with her lawyer instead of entrust it to a rusty box in the innards of a swamp with a hostile chief to dispense to someone who might or might not ever show up? How dumb can one woman be?<br />So, this book is like a Hogie sandwich...some thin slices of meat- Troy, Sr. and Stafford, but otherwise, too much tasteless bread (the swamp, the church and fixing the basement- what was THAT about?), etc. <br />High carb, time wasting junk food.
006016848X|5.0|I really like this book. At a time where everyone wants equality for the sexes, it's vital to be aware of our naturally different temperaments.<br />In today's society, where we try to give everyone equal rights, equally chance, equal opportunities, we tend to forget that we are different. Books like this one by Dr Gray, remind us that no, you can't treat everyone the same. There is no total equality. Men will be men, and women will be woman.<br />And especially when it comes to intimate relationships between man and wife; how much more crucial it is--to be cognizant of one another's psychological differences and respect each other's natural needs, desires and wants. <BR>Highly recommended. <br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated<br />PS here is a cheat sheet for reviewing the ideas in the book at a glace.<br />Differences men/women<br />Men Need:<BR>1.

B000001ESN|2.0|I think Lifeson and Peart are fine enough musicians in their own right, but I can't really hear them... first, because I can't get past the insipid, pseudo-cosmic lyrics. Add to that the fact that they're sung by what I can only describe as a squirrel on helium. That's far too much to ignore when trying to listen to their music.
B0001611DI|5.0|The Dawn of the Dead stands above the rest. This is a classic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Yes it's very 70's as you can tell by the arcade games and hairstyles, but the message is clear. Fight for survuval at all costs.<br />Like most zombie movies there is no real beginning and no real ending. The movie starts off with normal people fighting zombies, and ends with an escape on a helicopter to no where. But the bulk of this film is inside a shopping mall. A motley crew has barricaded themselves in a mall and after killing all the zombies inside, fight against the ones outside. The tractor trailer driving sequence is awesome and a thumbs up to the directing of this difficult set of shots.<br />The zombies are frightening, and can be a source of black humor that I'm sure was intentional. An good example is the lifeless zombies piling up on the esculator.<br />For a good time and to get the appreciation for good horror without modern day hocus-pocus effects, Dawn of the Dead cannot be beat. I have not seen the remake yet, but I know I'll walk away from it liking the original better (I usually do).
0385504209|1.0|This novel is very poorly written, I could hardly stand to read it. Save you time and money.
6305841861|5.0|While the first Evil Dead was good, it lacked something, and Army of Darkness (sometimes referred to as Evil Dead III) had the most money, Evil Dead II is a comfortable medium. It has the best black humor of the series and is just cheap enough to work as a lovable &quot;Hey guys let's see what we can do with what we have&quot; movie. This film will always have a special place in my heart. I saw it with my best friend at the time way back in '87 at the theater. We both loved it. Shortly after that, he ran away from home and I never saw him again.<br />For those who love some humor with their horror, this is a perfect film. Bruce Campbell is loved by his fans, and he appreciates what he is. A B-movie actor who loves what he does. Who couldn't like a guy like that. His timing is perfect and as Ash he's a character many can relate too. I mean c'mon who else in Hollywood can play a guy with a possessed hand and beat the crap out of himself.<br />This DVD has an outstanding behind the scenes making that is as entertaining as the film itself. It looks like so much fun, the average Joe would want to pick up his camera and make a movie with his buddies.<br />Though the extras show the tribute to Freddy Krueger in the shed, (right above and center to the door on the inside), his glove appears in one other scene. When Ash is in the celler to get the pages, there's one shot of the door he has to open and go through. On the left Freddy's glove hangs again.<br />ALso no one mentioned it, but when Demon Ash throws the professor's daughter against the wall and is about to kill her, he turns back into normal Ash atthe sight of his dead girlfriend's necklace. Check out the chain before he picks it up. Someone placed it in the shape of a skull.<br />For a frightening good time with the guys, or on the couch with that special girl, you can't go wrong with Evil Dead II. As Ash would say 'Groovy'.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is a huge departure for Tarantino, with his prior three films being unique from one another, but comfortably set within a laid-back, gangster dialog-filled setting.  What most people don't know, is that the man is not soley interested in a certain genre.<BR>Watching Quentin speak about film can be almost as exciting as one of his movies, and to listen to him for only a minute is to understand that he has a rarely broad knowledge of the medium.  In Kill Bill he obviously applies his knowledge and love of low-brow Asian action movies as well as American exploitation films.  Watching Kill Bill you would never guess that it was a first time foray into action by the director, and this is largely because of the wealth of things Tarantino had already learned from the masters going in.  Kill Bill is an admitted accumulation of amazing moments in grind cinema, \\"filtered\\" (sometimes more heavily than others) through the directors brain, similarly even to his previous movies (Reservoir Dogs is often noted to be largely a product of the HK film City on Fire).<br />Despite his notoriety for taking from other films, its undeniable that Tarantino had developed a style of his own; often mixed up chronology, witty banter-infested dialogs, impeccable music placement, and calculated pacing and cinematography.  His free use of homages to past cinema has even become a sort of trademark.  In Kill Bill, however, a lot of these characteristics are absent or less apparent.  Dialog is brief, and the words are stilted and delivered very purposefully.  It could be called cheesey, but I found it to be extremely effective thanks to quality acting and directing, though it wouldn't be out of place in a '70s exploitation film.  <br />Kill Bill takes from older movies probably more than any of Tarantino's other films, and much more obviously.  Fans of the genre will be able to pick out many, as most of them are completely on the surface.  It's easy to resent a movie for liberally taking somuch from other movies.  Many of the scenarios, for instance, are taken directly from other movies, as are costumes, characters, and action sequences.  The music too, is recycled.  The movie does not have an original score, rather it plays along with selected songs and pieces of other movies scores.  <BR>Even still, the movie can't be called a rehash or simple homage.  The music cuts are often ingeniously paired with scenes you might not usually pair them with.  The Green Hornet theme for B******e's arrival in Tokyo, or a sweet song from All About Lily Chou-Chou when she looks at Hattori Hanzo's swords for instance, work remarkably.  The selections are all great pieces of music, and this movie's enjoyment is largely derived from the soundtrack.<BR>Along with his unpredictably effective soundtrack, Tarantino has similarly paired elements from the films he loves, to create a hybrid that isn't really like anything else, despite their shared parts.  Without giving anything away; those who aren't familiar with these movies will be blown completely away, and those who are and aren't jaded about it will smile as they completely \\"get it\\".  Surprisingly, the best moments from so many films, paired together without the context of each of these individual films, works.<BR>Quentin Tarantino really is a master director, creating as one reviewer below said, \\"perfect\\" movies, in that they are perfectly executed.  The ideas in his films are largely unoriginal, and yet his execution is.  It wouldn't be wrong to say that this movie is comparable to Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho, in some ways.  Any way you look at it, Kill Bill is an exciting first half a film, and anyone mildly interested shouldn't be disapointed.
0385510438|2.0|Grisham disappoints the reader in this drab novel.  Too many inconsequential characters, which makes the book choppy to read.  Granted, a surprize ending, but not enough to propel the novel into a mediocre book.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Very rarely have I heard a soundtrack that is so heartbreakingly beautiful in its ability to not only penetrate deeply into the depths of your emotions but also to evoke the fantastic imagery of the film that it was a concomitant party to. Howard Shore is one of the few contemporary composers creating original scores  whom I honestly feel rivals the classics. Very Wagnerian in style, although touched here and there with Enya's new age Celtic tinged &quot;pop&quot; Shore has created a masterpiece that will stand strong against the disintegrating waves of time.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|So what if Axl Rose is doing his thing, taking him years to do it, but no matter what, People are still curious to see what he'll do next! People still want to see Axl Rose, he's a living Icon, his voice is untouched, of course he could use some work, since he's been out of the spotlight for a while. He needs to lay off the bottox, and either kiss n' make up with Izzy and the rest, or finally release Chinese Democracy, I'm glad this CD has been released, kind of a reminder, G N'R is still around, just not the same. Although I also agree, there are a lot of good songs missing from this CD. I think true fans of G N'R should consider buying it, not the people who like compilation CD's and buy greatest hits of everyone they listen to cause they just don't care about music or are too lazy to get into a band and hear all their songs, they'll just buy this CD and think thats all G N'R had, well their dead wrong. G N'R had the world in the palm of their hands, course major EGO's got in the way, blame it all on Mr.Bailey. Buy this CD TRUE GNR FANS!
B000003N7K|5.0|OK, what have you missed if you haven't heard this album?  The first time I ever played this cd, my wife came in and started slow dancing with me.  This is easily one of the most romantic cds ever recorded.  John Coltrane is inspired beyond belief, not in a fiery Blue Train way, but in a I am touching the romantic muse where she lives kind of way.  The supporting players all contribute so heavily&gt;  I am sitting here listening lush life, written by a 19 year old Billy Strayhorn(who at 19 knows more about love and loss than most men will know at their retirement).<br />And the words are, &quot;you are still burning inside my brain&quot;.  This easily is the way I feel about the voice of Johnny Hartman.  I could listen to this guy sing Barry Manilow.  He has a voice that cuts through all sadness to create a sadness all its own.  Your emotions disappear, and you are left adrift in the phenomenal voice of a master interpreter.  I guess he found a resurgence because of &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;, but this stuff is beyond Iowa sentimentality.  This, to me, is beyond hearts, flowers, lust, heartbreak, walks in a park at sunset, the seven wonders of the world.  It is music that leaves you thinking,&quot;Where has this been all my life&quot;.<br />and the answer is &quot;It's been here&gt;  Floating in the ehads of all of us who have ever walked on this planet, in love, heartbroken, or both.<br />Check it out.
B000000IW8|5.0|I love this album so much I wish I could give it 10 stars. While its not as timeless as Appetite For Destruction it is still a stone cold classic. Many of Guns N Roses' best songs are on here.While Use Your Illusion 2 is more artsy this one rocks harder and has a great ballad (November Rain) which is even better than Sweet Child O Mine.It even has a better guitar solo.Axl Rose has a great voice and Slash is an excellent guitar player but the lyrics are excellent as well. Coma is the hardest rocker on here but if you read the lyrics towards the end the song is really insightful. Who knew Guns N Roses could write so well? Other favorites include Right Next Door To Hell, Dust N Bones,Live And Let Die,Dont Cry,Garden Of Eden and Double Talkin Jive. One of the hardest rocking albums of all time.Classic.
0385504209|4.0|This book, in short is about &quot;Holy Grail&quot; and its frenetic chase by 2 parties. The book starts by describing the murder of curator of the famous Louvre museum in Paris (Jacqueas Saunere). At the murder scene, the curator, while in last dying moments, leaves a very curious encrypted message, presumably for his granddaughter Sophie (and an American symbology professor from Harvard, Robert Langdon. Since he openly leaves Langdon's name but having never met him before, Police take him as their prime suspect so there is a bit of police chase too). Langdon discovers that Saunere was a member of a very prestigious ancient secret sociery called &quot;Priory of Scion&quot;, whose previous grand-members included greats such as Da-Vinci and Newton. In short, Scion guards an ancient secret, so powerful and explosive in nature, that it could rock the foundations of modern church and christinaty. This secret is related to &quot;Holy grail&quot;. The church wants to find this grail and its references to destroy them to save their skin (and maintain their powerful stature) and they have made such attempts in the past. The Scion, a natural adversary of Church, guards this secret. However on the ominous day of Saunere's murder, all the 4 prominent members of the Scion are killed by someone (presumably in Church's payroll) endangering the loss of this secret forever. In order to make the secret hiding place of &quot;Holy Grail&quot; as uncompromisable as possible, Saunere has designed a &quot;keystone&quot; (hidden in a locker of a swiss bank), which holds the map to this secret place. This keystone is a double layered cylinder of 5 attached pieces and each piece has letters A to Z on its rim. Each layer can only be opened by a password (by aligning all 5 pieces correctly), which can be derived by finding answers to his mystique and symbolic verses. (Note that due to ingenious design, one cannot just smash the keystone and hope to retrieve the map). Langdon, who is faced with murder charges and Sophie, must race against time, away from the Police and a shodowy adversary (who is also after the keystone) to find this secret location.<br />On the positive sides, the chapters are short, fast-paced, intricately woven within each other and interesting. The author takes his time to slowly divulge many important details, which keeps your curiosity burning. The book is full of tremendous general knowledge, both interesting and mind-boggling. You get a crash course in the history of church, paganism, works of da Vinci, symbolism and much more.<br />On the drawbacks side, I was left with a few apprehensions in the end. We know who kills Saunere and other Scion members but it wasn't clear how he knew their names through such secrecy? Also in the end, though Langdon knew the secret location, the story ends right there (with Langdon getting a kiss and a date from Sophie - how predictable and Hollywoodish). At least some allusion to something interesting (like Langdon becoming Scion's grand master or he revealing the sacred secrets etc etc) would have been nice. What was the point of all this odyssey if this secret remains secret forever (It is told in the end that this secret will never be revealed as assumed otherwise)? It looks as if Robert Langdon won himself a French chick for all his toils and endangerement to his life...hardly a worth price. It left me with an empty hollowness. Maybe the author wanted to show (again symbolically) that Langdon, who through his manuscripts &quot;obliviously&quot; staggered around the pieces of the truth (through the story, it is revealed that Langdon almost knows the truth - he knows all the pieces like the Scion, the holy grail, the mystique symbology etc etc) only connected this jigsaw puzzle in the end and saw the truth in its pristine light. Maybe all this ordeal was great for Langdon, the true historian, who for this shred of immensely important historical knowledge would happily risk his life. But books are not written for characters, they are written for readers. As a reader, I was totally dissatisfied with the end. There are also flaws in the character behavior. Some brief examples are Sophie's estranged relation with her loving grandfather (Saunere) for a full 10 years, Langdon's decision to run when he knows he was falsely framed in Saunere's murder rather than surrender and take much better odds through legal means, the bank's manager's (Vernet) helping to Sophie and Langdon to avoid the police just to keep his bank's name out of the news - in all these instances, characters behave unnaturally.<br />However this is a &quot;must read&quot; because its good parts far outweigh a few anamolies.re not written for characters, they are written for readers.

B00012QM9K|5.0|Schindler's List is, simply put: Steven Spielberg's finest piece of work. Putting aside the heart-renching story of the holocaust, Spielberg has managed to muster some of the most amazing visuals ever--with an equally visually enticing cast (Neeson &amp; Fiennes).  This is one of Spielberg's last great films where he eloquently controlled the camera and actor's movements (sound like Raiders of the Lost Ark?) with uncanny precision.  Kaminsky's B/W cinematography reminded me of the older, intricately lit films of the 1920's and 30's (the ones shot w/nitrate film).  Buy the movie--and experience it.

0761957553|5.0|I have taken statistics as an undergrad and as an MBA student. I am good at math, not the stereotypical math phobic female.  But I always have had problems connecting the statistics with what to do, when to do it and what the results were telling me. Well, here I am again as a graduate student working on a Masters degree in Sociology.  I am working on my thesis and this book pulled everything together.  It matched up SPSS and statistics so that you know what to do, why to do it, how to make SPSS do what you want, and how to interpret the results.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  It is very clear, very cogent, in English as opposed to stero instructions, and charming as well.  I highly recommend it!
B000063DFQ|5.0|Following their breakthrough performance with \\"The Number of The Beast\\", Iron Maiden ventured forth their massive success by releasing their fourth studio album \\"Piece of Mind\\". It would eventually be one of many classic albums from Maiden, forever earning them the pinnacle of respect from the metal community. <BR>\\"Piece of Mind\\" would be the first record featuring Nicko McBrain on drums. Alas, \\"Life in Maiden was never the same again!\\" This change in the band's roster will result in what eventually will be known as the famous \\"Classic Maiden Lineup\\". <BR>The members in Maiden still acknowledge this album as one the best in their vast repertoire after all these years. Interestingly enough, they only play \\"The Trooper\\" in their present live-set. However, \\"Piece of Mind\\" was an important turning point for Maiden as it leads straight into their musical climax, \\"Powerslave\\".<br />Where Eagles Dare - 10/10   The first track of \\"Piece of Mind\\" is a song about the Clint Eastwood movie of the same name. McBrain's drumming skills are immediately conveyed in this intro, as he precisely drums his way through the 6 minute song. One of Maiden's best openers, it also acts as foreshadowing to \\"Aces High\\" on their next disc.<br />Revelations - 8/10   One of the slowest tracks on this disc. This is where Dickinson exemplifies his amazing vocal range and capabilities. It won't be immediately appealing, but this is a song that takes some time and patience to indulge and sink into.<br />Flight of Icarus - 7/10   Much like \\"Run To The Hills\\", this is one of Maiden's most overrated songs due to the fact that it's a single. An ode to Greek Mythology, it does have a great sing-a-long chorus. However, the conclusion of this song is unquestionably the highlight with awesome guitars contrasted with Bruce's amazing vocals.<br />Die With Your Boots On - 7/10   This track is probably the weakest lyrically on the album. Fortunately, it's saved by the band's fantastic instrumental skills. <br />The Trooper - 10/10   This is the gem of \\"Piece of Mind\\". Undisputedly, a Maiden classic even 20 years later. As mentioned earlier, it is the only song from this record that the band still keeps in their playlist. Mesmerizing guitar harmonies juxtaposed with Steve Harris's brilliant base to magically weave everything together, when combined with Bruce's memorable vocals, this is Maiden at its best!<br />Still Life - 6/10    This song is a disappointment because it had an extremely beautiful intro, and potentially could have been a classic as well. However, the rest of the song starts to drag. It is not bad by any means, just not as refined as others. An average effort here.<br />Quest For Fire - 7/10   Many critics seem to nail this song as \\"filler\\", especially the lyrics. However, what they don't seem to understand is that Iron Maiden has always been a band that wrote about subjects which were incredibly original. It takes balls to start a song with \\"In a time where dinosaurs ruled the earth\\" and still have it be a credible piece of music. This is traditional Maiden songwriting and also contains a very good solo.<br />Sun And Steel - 6/10   This is perhaps the weakest song on the album. Lacks overall structure but it has a few moments.<br />To Tame A Land - 10/10   Arguably the best track on \\"Piece of Mind\\" along with \\"The Trooper\\", this is another one of Maiden's closing epics. It is about a book named Dune, which was actually the original name for this song. 7 minutes of intense guitar adeptness with aggressive base work, always changing, and evolving, Maiden is shown once again as a cohesive unit. <br />Although there are no fillers, not all the songs are perfect with some being average at best. \\"Piece of Mind\\" is not a perfect album, but it deserves no less than 5 stars. It will forever hold a special place among the other metal masterpieces of all time.<BR> <BR>Nurture your mind with metal goodness.<br />- ToS.
B00018D44U|5.0|I have had about a month to listen to this CD now, and I like it even more than when I first got it.  &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is a wonderful CD.  Norah's voice sounds stronger than ever, and there is more variety of songs on this album compared to her first album.  Some songs, especially the beautiful &quot;Those Sweet Words,&quot; &quot;Sunrise,&quot; &quot;Carnival Town,&quot; &quot;The Prettiest Thing,&quot; and &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; and &quot;Toes&quot; would fit in perfectly on the first album, while others like &quot;Creepin' In&quot; and &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; lean a little bit more towards country and a new direction for Jones.<br />The album as a whole is not a radical departure from her first, but there are enough changes for it to avoid the sophomore slump.  You can't go wrong buying this album.
B0000009SI|4.0|Zappa took a compositional turn with this album. It's in the genre of \\"Over-Nite Sensation,\\" but further developed towards whatever it is musicians think of when they hear \\"Zappa,\\" and there was more like this and even further developed material to come. This album has a definitive main thread, even though it features four different drummers and four different bass players, because it's very bluesy. Even if the songs aren't played with typical blues progressions --with the exception of \\"Cosmik Debris\\"-- there's a bluesy feeling pretty much throughout, which mainly the guitar solos lend. But there's more than a feeling of blues to this album; the songs are complex to an unusual (yet not extreme) degree, but make sense, and are very well performed. \\"Apostrophe (')\\" is, in a way, an album in a genre of it's own - mainly for the highly individual compositions \\"St. Alfonzo\\" and \\"Father O'Blivion,\\" but also much because of \\"Uncle Remus\\" with its feeling of soul and gospel that isn't much heard anywhere else in Zappa's discography. Many think that \\"Stink-Foot\\" is not a highlight, and while I understand that point of view (since it fills a fifth of this 32-minute album and doesn't have a compositional quality like the other songs) I still find it highly entertaining and needed because of its groove. Don't let the length of the album scare you, btw - the material on it is worth the money. 4 1/2 stars.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I am not certain how to put it -- sure, there's not much of a &quot;plot&quot; if plot is what you are looking for, and sure, you are bound to be offended by some jokes if you are so PC you don't have any sense of humor left in you (and if you can't see that right next to the funny things ANY westerner would notice and comment on -- let's not be hypocritical here -- there are plenty of parts in the movie that evoke the beauty of the country and its inhabitants).  <br />If what you are looking for is something that feels like life, that's both hilarious and touching, and makes you think about relationships, and choices in life; if what you are interested in is a movie with perfect actors that have unbelievable chemistry between them, and a director who makes you feel as if YOU are the one in Japan, then this is the movie for you.  Clearly, one of the best films I have seen in a long time.
B00000BKI4|4.0|'Deserters Songs' is almost like removing a layer of dirt and uncovering a sparkling diamond. It seems like Mercury Rev were hit by golden rays of sunshine, going from an experimental-shoegaze sound to songs of amazingly lush beauty. This CD is very much in the same vein as 'The Soft Bulletin' by The Flaming Lips, yet less joyous and more reflective, with songs that make you want to drift-away to another place. Add to that the delicate strings of Badly Drawn Boy and quirky Brian Wilson-type structures/studio-noises, eg, flutes, harp, trumpets, bells, etc. Listen closely and you'll also find nuggets of Sgt Pepper's genius. A surprise lurking around every corner. Along with the neo-psychadelic angle, 'Deserters Songs' also has a wonderfully rich sound, almost like a classical symphony fused with Pink Floyd, deliberately crawling forward, moody and surreal. The way this album balances the complexities of the studio with emotion is astounding, intended for both production afficionados and those just wanting to be inspired. Easily one of the more brilliant releases of the 1990's. A delicious serenade. A crescendo of stunning musical beauty.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I see so many of the comments on \\"Lost in Translation\\" miss the point completely. It is not an \\"adolescent\\" exercise in \\"alienation\\". The fact that some think it is solely about alienation is just more evidence of not \\"getting\\" it. The distance that comes from being in a different culture is secondary. <br />It's about two people facing the possibility of change in their lives who could take one path but instead opt for giving each other strength and support and non-judgemental (unconditional)love. And there's nothing adolescent about that insight, or the beauty with which Miss Coppola puts it on screen. There's much more adolescent about what some people would have preferred to happen. <br />Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an older actor in a marriage that's breaking down. He's earning 2 million dollars for his family by doing an ad that goes against his basic principles as an actor, but still his wife is accusatory, just pragmatic, or cold. At one point he tries to speak to her on the phone, and she cannot really reciprocate. Maybe everyday life has taken the spark out of their marriage. Sometimes people just stop trying.<br />In meeting Charlotte (Scarlett Johannson) he encounters someone at a much earlier stage in her life, but who is also facing disillusionment with her marriage. In Bob's case, perhaps his marriage can be saved, but it is unlikely that Charlotte's will, because she is not part of the problem. Her husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is too glamor-struck to be a good bet for long. Maybe she hasn't come to terms with this yet, but she is aware of it.<br />So the story, no less \\"mature\\" than \\"Brief Encounter\\" is about what will happen to these two. How far will they go? Is shared sadness a solid grounding for a life? <br />Both of them see possibility here, in a situation where they are isolated from home. Romantically, Bob could fall further for Charlotte, but he'd prefer a meaningless fling, because ultimately it will be less of a life-devastating change. There's a beautiful scene on a bed where many men would have lied, played down the value of their other life, to build up romantic possibility, but Bob settles for truth. <br />Both of them give each other some strength to face what they must face. We don't HAVE to hear what Bob says. We know it is aimed at that. And in a way, whatever we heard would seem a disappointment when we know the emotion behind what is said. One person might love it, another might hate it. But it only needs to mean something to Charlotte.  And many viewers here have shown only too clearly they would not get that point whatever they heard.<br />I don't see how people see no plot or no point in any of this unless they define plot solely as conventional Hollywood story-telling. There is plenty of plot, plenty of point for the intelligent viewer, and a hundred times as much characterisation as in most commercial films I've seen in the past decade. <br />Plot, from the Greek Tragedies on down, is characters facing conflict who encounter it and grow. These characters do. The fact that the conflict is internal and not an alien or terrorist or murderer seems to give some people problems.<br />Coppola's judgement in all aspects, from a script with lots of spaces for mood to her handling of actors, is assured and mature. No one but Bill Murray could have played Bob Harris, unless it were maybe a deadpan English actor like Michael Caine. And Scarlett Johansson is both vulnerable and likeable. The film is beautiful to look at too. <br />And yes, it does not race pell mell through Tokyo. It takes time to let you look at things and figure out what people are feeling and thinking. For feeling and thinking viewers it's a rare and beautiful godsend.<br />The reason so many critics voted this a terrific movie is simple. It is.
B000001Y79|3.0|Tragic Kingdome seems like the most hyped recording by No Doubt.  With all those singles:  Don't Speak, Spiderwebs, Sunday Morning, etc.... I thought that this CD would be a classic.  Somehow, it is not.<br />The thing is that in addition to the five singles there are ten other tracks.  And many of them just do not do anything special for me.  I think the hooks are less memorable as on Rock Steady and The Beacon Street Collection.  Sixteen is an exception as its a fairly catchy new wave rock tune. Different People has a nice jazzy beat to it with good horn arrangements.  And the title track has some interesting textures to its style.<br />Therefore I count the recording as about a fifty fifty split between good songs and nothing special ones.  Therefore three stars seems like the right rating.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The album starts off with Nicko McBrain counting the lead-in to \\"Wildest Dreams.\\"  The other notable time that Nicko started off an album was Piece of Mind, with the awesome drum intro of \\"Where Eagles Dare.\\"  Wildest Dreams is a typical Iron Maiden rocker.  Adrian Smith contributes a lot to this song, and certainly the highlight of Wildest Dreams is his solo.  With that said, Wildest Dreams is probably the second worst track on this album.  There's just not really anything too memorable going on here.<br /> The second song, \\"Rainmaker\\" is far superior to \\"Wildest Dreams\\" and I'm glad they released this is a single, although in my opinion it should've been the first single.  This is mostly Dave Murray's song, and it features an excellent solo by him.  Rainmaker is not your typical Iron Maiden rocker, it's a little bit lighter, but it's very fast paced.  Certainly a welcome addition to the album, after getting off with a rocky start, this song gets the album on track for the next song.<br /> \\"No More Lies\\" is the only song entirely written by Steve Harris on Dance of Death.  I would say No More Lies is a fairly average song.  It has your typical \\"Fear of the Dark\\" song style of starting off slow and quiet, then getting loud and fast, and then ending slow and quiet.  This is definitely a crowd sing-a-long type song, as the chorus is the phrase \\"No More Lies\\" screamed over and over again.  It takes some getting used to, but I wouldn't have the chorus any other way, and No More Lies is certainly a better song than Wildest Dreams.<br /> With the next song \\"Montsegur\\" we are treated to the heaviest song on Dance of Death.  This song is, quiet frankly, perfect.  It's heavy, and fast, with some wonderful historical lyrics, and a great guitar solo by Janick Gers.  The three-axe attack shines on this song, and it's a shame this wasn't played live on the Dance of Death tour.<br /> \\"Dance of Death\\" is, obviously, the title track off the album.  This is one of Janick Ger's bestslices of writing he's done in Iron Maiden.  This is one killer song.  The lyrics are a little weak, and I cringe when I hear Bruce sing, \\"I danced and I pranced,\\" but I'm just going to chalk that up to the boys having a sense of humor.  The acoustic intro is wonderful, and the three solos (one by every guitarist!) are hair-raising.  I hope this song stays in their live set for future tours.<br /> \\"Gates of Tomorrow\\" is up next, and is the weakest song on the album.  It's got a horrible guitar intro, which would be much more suitable on an AC/DC album.  Bruce has several vocal lines in the chorus, and none of them are especially memorable.  If anything on Dance of Death can be called filler, it is this!<br /> McBrain gets his firsting writing credit!  Yes, it's true!  Nicko wrote \\"New Frontier\\" the first writing credit he's ever had on an Iron Maiden studio album.  Way to go Nicko!  This is an excellent song, and if No More Lies wasn't being released as an EP, I think this would've made a great single.<br /> It's time for your epic.  \\"Paschendale\\"  is... marvelous.  The three-axe attack is out in full force on this song.  Nicko and his trusty hi-hat start us off, and then Adrian comes in with his soft little guitar intro.  This song is jam packed, and the first time you listen to it, it might sound like a mish-mash of sorts, but after a few listens, the splendor begins to sink in.  This is probably Bruce's best vocal performance on Dance of Death, and the guitar solos leave nothing to be desired!  The lyrics make this song even better.<br /> The next two songs, \\"Face in the Sand\\" and \\"Age of Innocence\\" sound a little similar to each other, and that's just fine, because they're very good!  Face in the Sand is the only time Nicko has recorded a song with a double bass drum, and its sounds fantastic.  Some people might be a little upset that Iron Maiden have recorded a politically motivated song like Age of Innocence, but I have no problem with it.  I think it's only right for them to express their views.<br /> Dance of Death ends with \\"Journeyman\\" originally an electric song, but here an acoustic song.  Iron Maiden's first acoustic song to appear on an album!  What a great closer!  Maybe I'm wrong about Bruce's best performance being Paschendale, it could really be on here!  This too needs to stay in their live set.  A fantastic ending to a fantastic album.<br /> While Brave New World was good, Dance of Death is better, and far better at that.  The band seems to be working very well together, and the songs are all very, very strong.  It's not hard to see that Iron Maiden are still on top of their game.  I also feel that the production of this album is wrong criticized.  It's not as polished sounding as Brave New World, but the rawer feel seems to fit well with the songs.  I bought this album the day it came out, over six months ago, and I still listen to it regularly.  This album does not leave much to be desired, except perhaps another release from Iron Maiden...
0393057658|4.0|&quot;Moneyball&quot; is extremely well-written.  It is a quick read and a good read.  However, there are some problems with the information presented here.  Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, and Mark Mulder are all unbelievable pitchers and have much to do with the success of the low-budget team in Oakland; however, they are barely even mentioned in the book.  Michael Lewis spends more time on finds like Scott Hatteberg.  However, most of the A's success is due to the Big 3.  And Billy Beane deserves a lot of credit for finding and drafting those guys.  It's just not spelled out in this book.<br />To read this book and have no knowledge of baseball, you would think that all other GM's were idiots.  Guys who just didn't get it.  After reading this book, I'm not sure how Billy would find guys like Vlad, Sammy, Pedro, Ichiro (well, basically foreigners who wouldn't fit his statistical model).  Sometimes, relying on scouts is a good thing.  And sometimes drafting high schoolers (Griffey, Kerry Wood, Josh Beckett) is also a good thing, even if it is a bigger roll of the dice.  But Beane does have an admirable plan.<br />All in all, this book is a worthwhile read, even if it does have the noteable ommission of Hudson, Zito, and Mulder.
B00014K5TQ|3.0|I've watched both \\"Party Monster\\" as well as the documentary \\"Party Monster - The Shockumentary.\\"  While I found both interesting I was primarily struck by how much people effort people have gone in order to tell the world how \\"fabulous\\" Michael Alig was in his heyday.  One gets the impression that the makers of both films, along with the individuals he once associated with, almost think that it was kind of cute that he murdered a friend, dismembered the body, and then jokingly bragged about doing it to people around him. <br />In the documentary \\"Angel\\" is largely dismissed as a disposable individual, hardly worth missing. The only person who actually shed a tear for him being Angel's brother. I  really doubt that Angel's brother would have agreed to be interviewed for the documentary if he had known the way they were going to glorify Michael Alig while simultaneously portray his brother as a desperate drug dealing poseur.  <br />I think the film, rather than the documentary, was actually a bit more balanced.  Wilson Cruz,  Macaulay Culkin, and  Chloë Sevigny  were all incredible.  Their performances were unbelievably good.  Seth Green did OK, though all I could think about every time he came on screen was his appearance on Punk'd (for that matter all I could think of when  Dylan McDermott came on stage was Bobby Donnel).<br />Regardless of the agenda, the two films probably complement each other. If I had to watch one of them again I would see the film rather than the \\"shockumentary\\" if for no reason that the opportunity to see Chloë Sevigny again.  <br />I still think it is a bit scary when people justify a person's behavior by almost saying \\"well, he didn't really know what he was doing because he was on drugs. You can't really blame him because it was the drugs\\"
B000002LQR|4.0|The alternative, hip hop, punk, funk hybrid that is the Chili Peppers finally flies sky high on majik. The biggest marvel on this album is guitarist John Frusciante, quite possibly one of the most underrated guitarists of all time he kicks out some of the most distinctive funk riffs, the blazing \\"Suck My Kiss\\", \\"Give it Away\\", The second track(can't remember the name). He also demonstrates his knack for writing incredible ballads, \\"I could have Lied\\", \\"Under the Bridge\\", \\"Breaking the Girl\\", all hooky and passionate. Anthony Kiedis plums his soul to great depths one minute and then injects some anger into the funk the next, doing it all with sexy charisma and passionate exuberance. I don't even have to mention Flea's incredible bass playing. At the very least Majik is a relic from the infancy of alternative rock and a look back at the defining steps of one of rock's most underrated bands.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Where do I begin... The music industry is so messed up right now. Band's that really sound good are passed up for this kind of junk when they should be makin the big bucks. But hey, what do I know...One more thing. To all you Britney fans out there, step back and take a look at yourself. If your a pre-teen girl who watches way to much MTV, I guess your on the right track. If your a 16 year old guy (like me),though, and your &quot;In the Zone&quot;, just do yourself a favor, and step the hell out.
B0000035E7|4.0|ITs kind of ironic to think that all those shameless grunge imitators out there (Fuel,Puddle of Mudd,Nickelback) probably never heard Bleach, the searing 1988 debut from Nirvana. The brilliance of Bleach is that its so raw, uncromposing and angry, sure Cobain obviously had some woodshed time ahead of him in terms of lyrics(Blew sounds way too simple) riffs (a lot of the songs sound the same) and songwriting. The intensity overcomes such nitpicking though, Cobain roars through screeches of feedback, calls himself a Negative Creep and says hes stoned, and on the sarcastic \\"Scoff\\" screams, \\"In my room/youre not older/In youre eyes, im not worth it\\". Its all a blast to listen to even if Nirvana dabblers won't find it too inviting.
B00005JMEW|5.0|What a great homage to not only the chopsocky films of the 1960's<BR>and '70's but to every aspect of \\"Asian revenge\\" film that comes to mind.What Gladiator did for the \\"sword & sandal\\" genre and Starship<BR>troopers did for the big bug flicks of the 50's This film does in a<BR>scope that can barely be contained on the screen.<br />The story centers on Uma Thurman's character 'The Bride'once member<BR>of the elite asassination team called the Viper squad being left of<BR>dead after what seems to be a wedding day gone completely wrong for<BR>reasons we can only guess at. Waking up from her coma she plans<BR>a shopping list for a campain of revenge.<br />Sound familar? Sure it does and no matter how many different ways its presented we're still sucked in to see a good been done wrong & I'm out for justice flick. I'm not HUGE fan of the martial arts<BR>genre but I respect it for what it is.  Tarantino leaves no stone<BR>leaves no stone unturned in his in his tribute to greatness that<BR>we all felt when we first saw \\"The baby cart\\" series or an \\"Akira<BR>Kurasawa\\" film. From the great Shaw scope intro to the \\"5 Fingers<BR>of death theme you know your diving in head first.<br />     The dvd format is great I found the 2.35:1 widescreen format<BR>perfect. (I know some purist somewhere will complain) & dts sound<BR>supreme especially for those \\"5,6,7,8\\" music performances The dvd<BR>also sports extras in the form of bonus music numbers & a \\"making<BR>of document\\" along with trailers to all of Tarantino's past film<BR>greats and a teaser to the \\"Kill Bill\\" follow up. <br />For those of you wondering this the theatre version and the black<BR>& white sequence from the \\"Showdown at the house of blue leaves\\"<BR>part of the film is still in black & white.
B00000I07P|2.0|Theres no denying Jon Bon Jovi has an incredible vocal range and Richie Sambora, unlike many 80's guitarists can really wail when he wants to. The first half of this album fares much better then the second half. Theres arena rock gems like &quot;Let it Rock&quot;, &quot;You give love a bad name&quot; and &quot;Livin on a Prayer&quot;.  &quot;Wanted:Dead or Alive&quot; is worth listening to if simply to hear Sambora's sick guitar intro. Unfortunately the second half of the album collapses under its own hair gel. Theres a couple more rockers but mostly ballads so sappy they make Sammy Hagar look like a die hard cynic.  IT will make you grateful Kurt Cobain came along and destroyed this kind of  spandex and Vo5 charged poodle hair metal. In any case the album does make you wonder how much you got to fork over for those girls in the album jacket to wash youre car.
B000003S0Z|5.0|Even though I enjoy the ambient music genre, this is my favorite Eno ensamble with a broad mix of songs from begining to end which make the entire album great enjoyment to listen to over and over .. Particullarly &quot;backwater&quot; and &quot;Julie with..&quot; which have surprisingly excellent vocals that blend with the music and almost allow it to remain AMBIENT LIKE but less extreem. if you are just getting into ENO, I would suggest this CD and &quot;Another green world&quot;
B00007E8V4|5.0|This CD is breathtaking. This CD starts out heavy and fast but ranges from that all the way to a slow acoustic song. Standout heavy tracks are Mr. Jack, i-e-a-i-a-i-o, F*** the System, and Innervision. Standout slower songs are Ego Brain and the absolutely mesmerizing Roulette. I cannot say enough about this CD to express how GREAT it is. Please go buy this CD because SOAD is an amazing band.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Weezer is the king of alt rock. The \\"Blue Album\\" is one of the tops in this genre. Right from the anthemic \\"My Name is Jonas\\" to the beatiful yet hard hitting \\"Only In Dreams\\", the listener gets hooked in, and they never let you go. The release of the deluxe edition is really neat. The second cd is filled with awesome nuggets of weezer goodness, some not previously available on disc, and others that are just plain awesome. I heart Weezer!
B000002H2H|5.0|Get this CD! Every single song is excellent and it definetly is the best Metallica CD ever. With great songs like &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;Fade To Black,&quot; it has the best classic Metallica songs. Get this CD right away!
B0001CNRS4|5.0|I wanted to go see this movie when it was playing on theaters unfortunately I didnt get the chance to,This movie came out on DVD yesterday March 23,2004 and I went to buy after never seing it before and reading horrible reviews, but hey I took $17.00 dollars and bought the movie let me tell you I regret it after I walked out of Target I was thinking to myself What the hell did I just waste my money on, Anyway when I went home and bought it I wasnt at all dissapointed the movie is actually really good and inspiring OK so its kind of predictible but nothing in the world is perfect
B00005JM0B|2.0|another animated movie,arnold has not a big hero character here<BR>just a slave to protect a stuped boy, based on terminator 2 ,no great idea has been created in this movie,arnold play the weak character here (not as always),dont waste your money on this movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love the music on this CD! One of my friends raved about it, so I decided to buy it, and I'm so glad I did. I haven't even seen the play, only read the book, and I still find the music wonderful. I think the highlights of the CD are Defying Gravity, What is this feeling?, and Dancing Through Life. This CD is a real treat, don't hesitate to buy it.

B00001MXXH|5.0|Ferris Bueller is a film worth owning in a DVD collection, not only because it is a wonderful film, but also because it is one you can see over and over again. My favorite movie.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I picked up this soundtrack 2 days after I saw the film and was immediately impressed.  Every piece that was selected brought me back to the portion of the film from which it was from.  Like all of Tarrantino's previous soundtracks, this piece fully lived up to the movie.  <br />One of my favorite pieces is the Charlie Feather's track. It was a breath of fresh air to hear some Rockabilly used in a mainstream movie. Flower of Carnage is a hauntingly beautiful piece, that seems to underlay the violence of the scene that it is used in.  I was pleasently suprised with Zamfir's piece, never really having been a fan of his work in the past.<br />I would recommend this album to anyone who wnats to hear music that doesn't fit the conventional mold of soundtracks that hollywood pushes out
B000089RVX|4.0|Wow.  Amy Lee's vocals are powerful.  She is an amazing talent and is using her voice appropriately.  Her voice soars perfectly and delivers its message with little need to understand the words to the song.  You can hear the passion and the pain.
B000002U9W|4.0|I like Atom Heart Mother for it isn't. <br />I think I need to preface my comments by saying I like The Wall, but DSOTM isn't one of my favorites. I know I risk irritating Pink Floyd faithful, especially by appearing to be 'above it all' by putting DSOTM moon down. It simply isn't one of my fav's - I like AHM and Meddle better, I really do.<br />What I like about AHM is it is Floyd's most 'Prog Rock'ish effort. I like Genesis. I like Yes. That also may not sit well with the faithful, I don't know. But AHM is lighter than some of the ensuing 'sanity' quadrillogy (though of course does touch on it as apparently Roger had little else to talk about). It is a spacey in some areas, but is mostly tightly constructed. <br />It overall has a cleaner 70's production sound (versus the 60's stuff) but yet hadn't fallen into the darker creative tones of the later 70's Floyd material. Having worked backward through the catalog, somewhat, I found it to be a breath of fresh air. This, along with Obscured By Clouds and the live disk of Ummagumma gave me a whole new appreciation of Floyd between the Barrett era and DSOTM. I had Meddle and some snippets of the stuff on Relics, but that sampling didn't tell nearly the tale. ATH (and the rest) really filled in the blanks in my Floyd appreciation.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|While their music might not be revolutionary, this is still a good CD.  Good riffs, catchy lyrics are in many of the tracks.  Cold Hard B**** is probably the best offering.  Roll over DJ is also good.  Are you gonna be my girl is the currently getting pop attention, but is still decent.  Overall, its not a bad CD.  And considering there arent too many current bands playing this genre of music, I couldnt pass it up.
B000000QFV|4.0|First off, let's get this out of the way...as you should know, this is not an Ozzy with Sabbath album.  In fact, it's not even any of the original Black Sabbath members besides Tony Iommi.  So sure, maybe this should have a different name than Black Sabbath but that doesn't automatically make this a bad album no matter how you look at it.  The album starts out with the epic track, &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; (my personal favorite track on the album) which greatly shows vocalist Tony Martin's incredible ability.  The tracks that follow keep the intesity especially the powerful &quot;Law Maker&quot; as well as &quot;Valhalla&quot;; both of those tracks are extremely catchy and will be stuck in your head after a few listens.  Most incredible about this album though, more important than the catchy lyrics, would be the incredible musicianship.  Tony Iommi, as always shows such innovative guitar work and Cozy Powell's drumming is stellar.  The keyboard and bass are incredible as well, and Tony Martin's vocals on this CD prove how truly under rated that he is.  The only downside is that this CD for the most part does not sound like Black Sabbath, and Sabbath purists may be disapointed by this.  The whole gothic sound of the group is pretty much gone from Tyr.  Tyr sounds more like an Iron Maiden album than a Black Sabbath album, but that doesn't take away the fact that this is an awesome listen.  On top of this, the album is very cheap and well worth the few bucks.  Open minded metal fans, this is a great addition to your collection.
B00005JL3A|4.0|The plot (if at all) of the  movie has been reused many many times before: evil corporation, things gone wrong. But all this is not the most important for horror thriller (although it never hurts) as this movie proves. This movie has suspense (at least it kicked my adrenaline), the special effects are quite good (I would do without the monster in the end though, which I thought was silly) and the acting is more then adequate.
0783219733|1.0|This movie is terrible in that it sends very mixed messages to children.  A veterinarian &quot;villian&quot;, a father hitting a &quot;bad guy&quot; and getting cheers from his family, etc.  This, and a very scary and intense near-drowning scene (of a child) made my 4-year-old cry.  We ended up turning it off and having a long talk afterwards with our daughter.  I'm glad we only rented it but I'm kicking myself for not previewing it first.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Truth be told...there aren't many T.V. Families that are actually written like real people, but the Fishers are the real deal.  Barring the whole funeral business, this is my family; dysfunctional, blunt, and interesting. Anyone with a dark sense of humor and the gift of sarcasim will pull up a chair and lose themselves in the rich, morbid, and sometimes bluntly honest world of the Fishers. The only problem now is that HBO can't get the darn things out on DVD fast enough for myself or other fans.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|At first I didnt think it was a good movie, dont know why, you know this is just one of those feelings you get before trying out things. Well indeed it turned out to be one of my favorites. Probably because the story line is much similar to one of my life stories. If you want to know how it feels when two complete strangers, with completely different backgrounds, in different stages of life (one just married, one married from 25 years) have the most complete understanding of each other, without necessarily physically penetrating into each-other, in a land of strangers and total non-understanding, then buy this movie and watch it over and over again. Arent we indeed lost in translation in our everyday life, whether in our most familiar neighborhood or in the most outlandish place on earth, and isnt this non-appropriative communication the two main characters have in the movie the best way to get to understand each-other? I'd had given it 5 stars hadnt it been for that final kiss in the movie, we didnt need that final complacency with cliches.
B00004S367|5.0|While not as consistantly brilliant as Innervisions or Songs in the Key of Life, Music of My Mind has several gems on it.  &quot;Superwoman&quot; is the best on this album, an epic that points forward to future numbers such as &quot;Living for the City.&quot;  &quot;Sweet Little Girl&quot; is just plain fun, with Stevie pleading (with a drawl, no less):  &quot;You know yo' baby love you, more than he loves his clavinet.&quot;  &quot;Happier than the Morning Sun&quot; is a nice, mid-tempo song that reminds me a lot of &quot;Big Brother&quot; on Talking Book.  &quot;Keep on Running&quot; has been criticized as too long and repetitive, but I think it's the most frenzied funk that Stevie has ever done.  It's like &quot;Superstition&quot; on speed.  The other songs aren't quite as strong, but they definitely aren't filler, either.  Overall, this is a fantastic album that you shouldn't overlook.  If you want to hear a fully polished Stevie at his creative peak, buy Innervisions.  But if you want raw soul and a portrait of a developing 21 year old genius, pick up Music of My Mind.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Franz Ferdinand - This cd is fun, 80's-ish, mod-ish, rockish, poppish. From the moment jaqueline kicks in to the end of 40' this cd is surpirising, clever, changing, new, fun, and they really know how to make a song rock. This is a cd that you'll listen to the whole way through everytime that you put it in without skipping tracks. The lyrics are great, &quot;Micheal&quot; lyrics scared me a bit, especially with the COME ALL OVER ME noticeably crossed out in the lyrics book. I dont know if they like men or they're pulling a Kinks &quot;Lola&quot; but the lyrics scare me i do know that. Otherwise I love the &quot;Jaqueline&quot; &quot;We only work when we need the money!&quot; as well as the rest, great cd overall very happy with this one. I would recommened this cd to any fan of Stellastar
B00006879E|5.0|I've been a big Square fan for quite a while (they actually went to my high school), so when I heard Square's James Valentine was with a new band, I immediately went out and got the album.  Simply put, &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is the first CD I've heard in quite a while that just flat rocks out.  The soul and funk influences are clear, but, being a big Black Crowes fan, I really love that about this album.  My favorite cuts are &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot;, because they're the most rock-based tracks.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|One can only hope that the success of this album causes the record companies to release Origin of Symmetry and Hullabaloo 'Stateside. This is a beautiful, brilliant album, orchestrated opulence done to perfection. All the raw power of Origin with an extra blend of professionalism and classical composition. It was the best album of 2003, and it's still the best album of 2004.
B00004RF97|5.0|Katharine Hepburn is absolutely fabulous as the strong and determined Tracy Lord.  Accompanying her is the remarkable Cary Grant, and everyone's best friend, Jimmy Stewart.  The two leading actors are perfect in their roles.  The chemistry between the characters is terrific.  Tracy Lord's little sister, Dina, is amazingly funny.  The story is a great story.  This is a classic, which Kate Hepburn should have won an Oscar for.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Even though they are no longer together as a band, Savage Garden truly remain the worlds most beautiful gift to music and life understanding. <BR>These two immensely talented and genuinely nice, kind hearted entertainers from my home country are able to, through their deep feelings of love, care and optimism, bring you to a point in your life of true understanding. Their talent shines even higher when you know that what you are listening to was written completely by Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones who deliever these songs to you as Savage Garden.<BR>Their albums bring to you an acceptence of the worlds workings and an acceptence of all the things the world can offer you through the good times and bad. The lyrics, delivered by a voice of pure perfection that creeps into your soul and grabs on with all it's power, inspire you to see a world and life both worth celebrating and fighting for. The instrumental accompaniment to these life affirming lyrics are arranged to be able to produce a raw undeniable passionate story that could stand alone even without words.<BR>The songs alternate from fast paced body shaking tunes to heart melting love songs to inspiring tales of help and hope and to sad moments of loss and realisation.<BR>There is not a bad song on their CD's at all and not a tune out of place. It is the most unique and original sounding form of pop/rock the world has ever seen.<BR>The album Affirmation along with Savage Gardens self titled debut release as well, will have you relating to and seeking comfort in the power of these songs wherever you are in the stages of your life. Savage Garden will illuminate your soul and help you understand, accept and love the beauty in the pain and the pain in the beauty, in a very entertaining way.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singing in the Rain is the greatest movie of all time.  It shows that a film doesn't need to be rolling on the floor hilarious, or hugely dramatic to be great; it just is great.  It is a film filled with fun.  Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds are great.  They show so much talent, and the dancing is fabulous.  Donold O'Conner is so funny.  He is the best part of the film, with his comedy combined with his talent for dancing.  As well, the classic Singingin the Rain scene is terrific.<BR>The DVD includes great extras and great documentaries.  It is a must have.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I loved the movie and to be able to bring home the soundtrack just makes the imagines portrayed in the film that much more tangible.  <br />I love &quot;Mary goes to Jesus&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot;.  <br />Over all, it is a album worth making purchase of.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|True Sarah fans who love her music so deeply would be very disapointed. It has some nice songs, such as Fallen, Stupid and Time but the rest are just a long trail of blahhhhhhhhhhh in one tune. This is not to Sarah's standards, which is very high. This cd is nothing compared to her previous ones... she is also too 'happy' in this cd. Nothing truely special and has not created any creative songs here. Sarah is a truely amazing artist and this cd is disapointing!
B00005JN08|5.0|I`m 17 years old. I saw this Movie just recently in the movie theater and I have to say, it is just great. I`m from Germany, so I liked the German parts in it. I really enjoyed the movie and I`m going to see it again. I don`t think it was very offending. You just have to know, that it is a comedy and it was one of the best I have seen so far.
0316776963|5.0|Sedaris does it again.  This one is not as entertaining as &quot;Naked&quot; but still does the job.  Sedaris writes about the full spectrum of human feelings and makes it funny, hysterically, at the same time.  So good, you can barely put it down, I promise you that.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|An absolutely stunning movie based on an absolutely stunning series of books. I'm about half way through the Aubrey Maturin series right now and notice that the movie takes elements from more than one or two of them. In fact the \\"weevil\\" joke is in about book 6.<br />Russell Crowe is a perfect Jack Aubrey. Paul Bettany a bit too tall and good looking for Stephen. And shouldn't Bonden have been bigger and burlier? Pity Jack and Stephen's wives weren't here. I'd like to have seen a good screen incarnation of Diana. Peter Weir does a brilliant job of showing us a ship as a floating community. And the things we learn about ship surgery are daunting.<br />The story, like the books, meanders a bit, but it's one of those instances where the journey is more important than the destination.
0743216458|5.0|As I read through many of the reviews, too many stood out. Reviewers that felt Ambrose was being too patriotic.<br />We have a strange phenomenon in this country today. If you say you love your country, support our troops and military you are too rah-rah, nothing but a mindless cheerleader, or illiterate.<br />The story of Easy Company is one of heroes!  Men from all walks of life who gave three years, untold pain, suffering and for too many their very lives so that many European countries could enjoy the freedoms they have had the last 60 years. Not that the rhetoric from those countries today would ever indicate that. <br />Why so many spend their time and energy to denigrate, disparage, or vilify those that have given us this freedom is beyond me. <br />To all the men of Easy, WWII, of Korea, of Viet Nam (my father's two years), the Gulf both times, Afghanistan, and every spot in the world our troops have been sent, thank you.  <br />You have my utmost appreciation, admiration and 10,000 Ambroses could not sound your's or America's patriotic horn long or loud enough to honor you!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Just like to say, in response to one reviewer, that it's perfectly possible to love Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson AND love &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. I thought &quot;Zoolander&quot; was great and eagerly await &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;. Also we have Wilson to thank in part for the terrific &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; which also provided a great but all too short role for Bill Murray. Yes, both have been in their share of rubbish, but they've had their good moments. <br />&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is just a different, more evocative and poetic kind of movie. I'm happy that all these kinds of movies are being made. I don't see the point in knocking one kind of movie to boost another. I don't want to see the same thing every time I go to the cinema. And &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a refreshing change. A brilliant film.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|althought i'm leading towards worse.  i'm a huge dream theater fan, and a fan of the prog rock scene in general.  at first listen, i didn't like this cd much at all.  it's heavy, but inescapably so.  i began to find myself actually getting bored with their songs by the end, with lack of variation (something that has never been a problem, even with change of seasons).  the more i listen, the less the guitar solos seem sinfully long (don't get me wrong, i play and John is my god, but it's a little out of hand in places), and i got to be more okay with it being so hard.  i still feel like there isn't enough variation in songs, or on the cd as a whole, and the fast soloing is a little out of hand in places as well (my favorite thing about John is his ability to incorporate fast playing into soaring melodies, and he just doesn't do that on this album).  if you don't dig their hard stuff, don't even look at this, but other than that, definitely check it out.  because hey, it's still dream theater.
0679428895|5.0|The Roman aqueducts get best supporting oscar in this fascinating historical fiction piece.  The volcano doesn't get center stage until the last few chapters - it's the amazing workings of the waterway that keeps the reader mezmerized.  If you like an intelligent read that tells you something you didn't already know, you're in for a treat.
0192833588|1.0|It is a great pity they allowed her to die a natural death.<br />The story is about 3 daughters and a mother who are reduced to visitors at their own home after the father dies, which allows the son to inherit the estate. After that, Austen pulls in this idea about Sense and Sensibility.<br />Let's put it this way: NOTHING HAPPENS! Elinor and Marianne fall in love with two men, who end up breaking up with then off and on throughout the book until the end when one of them actually marries one of the men. And it is the most boring piece of garbage ever to be written. I'm going to burn my copy after I'm done with it, which should be soon. This book is for women. Not for a man such as myself. I do not recommend this book to anyone not trying to fall asleep fast. It goes well with My Antonia as being good fuel for a fire. Never read this, this is crap. I don't care who you are.
B00005221M|1.0|Due to my background in the Arts I do appreciate and understand that the movie simply cannot be the book on film (with the possible exception of some of EM Forester's works).  I am more than willing to cut film adaptions of novels some slack for the changes they often have to make due to time and focus limitations (such as with Midnight in the Garden of Good &amp; Evil)rather than just toss off the oft uttered phrase &quot;the book was better.&quot;  In many cases (like Silence of the Lambs) the book and film both succeed.  None of this, however, can be said of Last of the Mohicans, which is unquestionably a mangled adaption of a far a better adventure novel.  In fact, it's more accuate to say that the movie happens to have the some of the same characters as the book.  Beyond a couple scenes and the title, the film has nothing to Cooper's outstand novel. Calling it an adaption is as misleading as the liberal strokes apparently permitted by the credit statement &quot;based upon the book by...&quot;  If you want to the Last of the Mohicns...you won't find it here.  This is one case where the book was definately better!

B00005UKE0|5.0|While many people think of John and Paul when thinking of the Beatles, they should not discount the other two members. The wackiness of Ringo Starr was also a great factor of thier success and let us not foget the great guitar work of the enigma,known as George Harrison. George Harrison was recently honored and inducted into the RNR Hall Of FAME, AND IT WAS SURELY DESERVED. His debut solo album was one classic piece of art that will never go away. From great pop songs like &quot;What is Life&quot; to the spiritual &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, this album is sure to stand the test of time. &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is a classic for any Beatle fan, and most of all any fan of music. George Harrison is gone, but not forgotten and one can only imagine he is jamming with John right now. Godspeed George, you are truly a genius.
0321200683|5.0|Gregor has a gift for explaining design patterns. We were trying to explain the problems with passing a large file up and down a messaging bus to our bioinformatics users, when I ran across Enterprise Integration Patterns. As soon as I showed the Claim Check pattern to our designers, they got it instantly. Five of my colleagues purchased the book, and we asked Gregor to come teach a class on it. This is the best written book on design patterns I've seen. I reallly like the list of patterns inside the book cover -- nice terse explanation, and great mnemonic icons.
B000003S5H|3.0|This CD is worth getting for \\"All I Need\\" and \\"Kelly Watch the Stars\\" alone. \\"All I Need\\", like many other tracks on the album, features the sensual vocals of Beth Hirsch. I would probably buy one of her CDs before another Air CD! Her voice really makes some of the tracks, although on tracks like \\"Kelly Watch the Stars\\" Air are more than able to inject their own vibrancy into the music without Hirsch. Some tracks on the album, like \\"Remember\\", are lacklustre and monotonous, and for that it gets a three as opposed to a four from me. Still a good buy though! It's great to hear quality electronic contemporary music that rises above the dull depths of the likes of Scooter et al!
0446530891|5.0|Having read all of his books I find this one to be more of a mystery. His plotting and growth of characters excell as always and there is some &quot;Thriller&quot; to it but I feel he is long on the mystery side in this novel. Saying all that I would highly recommend this book, all of his books are a pleasure and this one rates right up with the best.
B00008BRBG|5.0|&quot;Every Breath you Take&quot; was the biggest Police song, but lets take a trip back to when the Police wern't pop. I'm talking about this album which reminds everyone how the Police got to be so big. Every song is listinable to the avid rocker (the last two songs; &quot;Won't You be My Girl(Sally) and &quot;Masako Tango&quot; are strictly hardcore). Their punk roots really shine on &quot;Next To You&quot;, &quot;Truth Hits Everybody&quot;, and &quot;Born in the Fifties&quot;. &quot;Roxanne&quot;, which is overated but a good song, remains the biggest hit on this album. Outlandos's best songs have to be &quot;So Lonely&quot; and &quot;Can't Stand Losing You&quot;. Outlandos d'Amour and Regatta d' Blanc still remian to be the best Police albums. This is punk rocking Police that never could be beaten on later albums.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I saw this film in the theater.  There were only two other people there.  It was boring, slow-moving and had no plot.  It was about two people being bored in Tokyo.
B00013RC8O|5.0|If you were a teenager in 1971, you probably saw this from the backseat of your VW bug. Windows steamed up, rainy friday night. Boone's Farm bottles hidden discreetly (next to the seat inside the driver door). Well now the video and audio are caught up to today's standard and the movie even comes closed captioned for us Jensen / Craig stereo owners playing Hair of the Dog full tilt! Remember...? &quot;Now you're messin with a ...&quot;<BR>When you're 15 or 16, it just makes sense that a grown up, like  ex-cop Kowalski wants to drive a supercharged Dodge from Denver, Colorado to San Francisco in 15 hours. The powers that be have done a great job restoring both visual and audio to this film. The late Cleavon Little runs a very close second to the car as the take over star. You get to see Delaney, Bonnie (Bramlett) &amp; Friends including Big Mama Thornton. And let's not forget the naked blond babe in the desert.<BR>Anyway I just was not getting the right memories sitting in my comfortable living room watching this classic so if you're missing the good old days, try this: Get some friends to help carry the big screen tv set  and dvd player into the garage. Get your kids old swing set and place it between you and the screen. Put up those yellow bug light spot lights just to the right or left of where the screen is. Park your car at the bottom of the drive way. Run a bad sounding speaker out to one of the side windows. Remove one windshield wiper. Turn on sprinkler system so it simulates a heavy drizzle. About 30 minutes of the movie, run into the house and tear up a $20 bill. Bring back popcorn, nachos, cokes for the kids, cups of ice for the grown ups (still only a quarter each.) Forget napkins, and going to restroom. And go back and enjoy the movie! To add realism honk your horn, moon passers by, and flash headlights at screen!<BR>Throw trash on your lawn and drive off with speaker still in your car. Watch broken glass as your leaving. Drive around for a few hours orstop to neck. Then sneak into your own house before your teenage children get home.<BR>This is a &quot;have fun&quot; and enjoy movie. The bonuses are almost none existent (a 20 second TV trailer, a 1:00 minute TV trailer) and that sort of stuff.<BR>Don't criticize this one by comparing it to the new ones, just smile shake your head and reminisce. I still want that Challenger and Bullitt's Mustang AND CHARGER. No sissy toyotas in my movies!!!<BR>John Row
B00005QIPH|5.0|Okay maybe there not the most original, but then again, WHO is?????????<br />Radiohead is a carbon copy of king crimson's album &quot;In The court of the Crimson King&quot;.<br />Basically every alternative band is either Pearl Jam or Nirvana wannabes.<br />Punk is just Blink 182 getting worse and worse as more MTV bands pile on,<br />The Darkness is obviously rooted in the 80's/<br />THE ONLY band that &quot;I&quot; listen to that NO ONE ever has or ever will sound like is primus.<br />What's my point, take the album for the music and the songs not the genre roots.<br />I couldn't get it out of my CD player for 6 months.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|it's a great song with valeus. i like it a lot.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|This is a fun little movie, though some of the stronger story elements get lost in the crowd. Excellent performances by Linney, Neeson, and the always wonderful Emma Thompson. Be on the look out for the romantic comedy cliche of Hugh Grant dancing around while unknowingly being seen by a secretary! Hilarious and so completely original! Seriously, not a bad one to rent, worth seeing.
0385336810|4.0|Can You Keep A Secret has all the makings of a good read. It is funny, romantic at times, exciting, and put together in an easy-to-read, fun fashion. You've got to like Kinsella's wit. She makes an approach that should be considered \\"done before\\" but it doesn't seem that way when she does it. Stories that would otherwise sound cliche, don't fall into that trap when Kinsella tells them. Admittedly, the book can be very predictable at times. Of course all this chaos would \\"coincidentally\\" arise when she has confided all her secrets in a man whom she thought was a stranger. Nonetheless, it is guiltess fun, worth the read, and very entertaining. Can You Keep A Secret is a good read. You want a GREAT read? Well, then you really should read Lucky Monkeys In The Sky by Michele Geraldi or a short list of other books (i put in listmania) that have been published in the last few years. Those books REALLY break ground and stay with you for a long time emotionally. But, certainly read Kinsella's book for some carefree fun. Let loose for a while.
B0000DBJDM|3.0|You have to appreciate that it was 1970.  No surround sound 5.1 no big light show.  The concert is actually filmed live in an empty old roman empire stadium.  The highlight was echos.  THe rest is just OK.  The dog, singing the blues is cool.  Most of the interviews are very difficult to hear.  I have an old tape copy, maybe the new DVD release has address this.  <br />In conclusion, its just OK, and probably only for serious floyd collectors.  Pulse is the best.  They need to release Delicate sound of thunder on DVD.
0780626966|5.0|I have never watched a DVD collection so much as this series. It has everything you could ever possibly want in a Freddy collection. I was totally amazed not only did they have all of the movies of course. But for Freddy's Dead they installed the 3D version I remember seeing in the theater along with the 3D glasses. The jump to menu scene's and interactive menu's are absolutely incredible. They even have jump to nightmare available as well. I also had a chance finally to go through the commentary's on Nightmare on Elm Street with Wes Craven, Heather Langencamp, John Saxon and Jacques Haitkin (Director of Photography) do an entertaining job of spilling secrets and how they did certain scene's and what was going on at the time of the making of the film. The only one missed was Robert Englund of course. Also Wes Craven does more commentary with Wes Craven's New Nightmare and gives even a more insight to the new and darker Freddy and some interesting tidbits on Heather Langencamp and some of the other actor's as well as characters. But with this purchase you won't be sorry at all. This is for any huge Freddy Fanatic. The pictures are as clear as can be. And each DVD comes with something extra and the entire set comes with an additional DVD which is an encyclopedia to the series which I have yet to go through myself. Even if you've never experienced The Nightmare on Elm Street series before this is the best way to do it. But I highly recommend this set. It's one of the best. And it brought back a lot of fun memories of watching the movies late at night on Television when they used to be played a lot, but the best thing is that the movies are un cut. But everything about it is a magnificent item to buy for a horror fan or a DVD collector!
B00006879E|5.0|As I received my cd in the mail, of songs about Jane, I popped open the plastic wrap and couldn't wait to hear from Maroon 5. And I have to say this Cd is what I have been waiting for in years. Very nice to listen to while working, with the popular tunes &quot; This Love &quot; and &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; they did an awesome job on this album. Ladies, this one mends the heart, like no other. Their vocals are amazing, each song has it's own beat. Definetely recommend this for purchase. This a CD definetely worth your 15 bucks.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|WrestleMania XX was an average pay-per-view at best. With only a handful of above-average matches. Here's my rundown of the top bouts that occured at the event. Keep in mind: I rate at a bust of five stars (*****).<br />1. World Heavyweight Championship:<BR>Triple H [c] vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels<BR>*****<BR>-Incredible match. Jaw-dropping spots and excellent mat wrestling give this match a nod for M.O.T.Y. (Match of the Year). This match combined all the elements that make pro wrestling great: an electric crowd, 3 technically savvy workers putting on a tremendous show, and the crowning of a new (and deserving) World Heavyweight Champion.<br />2. WWE Championship:<BR>Eddie Guerrero [c] vs. Kurt Angle<BR>****1/2<BR>-Another great bout. The mat work was superior to the triple-threat, but the World Heavyweight Championship made up for that flaw with lots and lots of blood that fueled the intense flow of the match. The reason this one doesn't get a perfect rating was the somewhat 'weak' looking finish. It wasn't that bad. ...<br />3. Two on Three Handicap Match:<BR>The Rock and Sock Connection vs. Evolution<BR>****<BR>-Highly entertaining match. The Rock and Ric Flair put on a great show with little spots here and there. Foley and Orton looked suprisingly good (considering that Foley hasn't wrestled in four years). Batista seemed out of place. However, all five participants succeeded in providing a nice match to set up a Foley/Orton match down the line. The ending was beautiful and very spotaneous.<br />4. Chris Jericho vs. Christian<BR>***1/2<BR>-Nice match, the spots were well planned and the technical wrestling was off-the-page enthralling. The butterfly suplex spot was especially cool to see. The plot twist (in the Jericho/Trish storyline) at the end further cemented Jericho into a babyface role. <br />Well, that's the end....of the good matches. The rest were either mediocre or below-average. I recorded this on VHS and don't plan on buying the DVD set, regardless of how much extra crap WWE loads onto the disc set.<br />So only buy this DVD if you know what you're paying for: which is four great matches, eight stinkers, and a slew of ill-conceived vignettes.
B00013F38K|1.0|\\"However, in theory, if the DVD was re-created from the original source material instead of the edited source material, than no abnormal cropping or destortion should occur.\\"<br />Nope, sorry. The aspect ratio of 35mm film is 4:3. Kung Fu was shot on 35mm film, and the original broadcasts showed the full frame, as intended.<br />This presentation is cropped, and it is totally unacceptable. It's just as bad -- worse -- than pan-and-scan presentations of widescreen movies, because the visual information that's been cut out -- the top and bottom of the image -- is even more important than the sides that are removed by panning and scanning.<br />The studios MUST be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be tolerated. If viewers want to fill their 16:9 screens, well that's what the zoom control is for. That will crop the top and bottom of a 4:3 image too, but then at least the entire original frame is still there on the disc for those who want to see it.<br />Don't buy this. Don't encourage the studios to mangle more classic TV shows this way.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Bahdu rocks,under all kinds of temptation to sell she stays funky. The emobodiment of womanhood and black unity bahdu creates a stellar follow up to Mama's gun one the most under rated CD's of nineties. This is type of CD that all types of music fans can appreciate and enjoy.
B00006JI8V|5.0|My daughter first heard Sonata and pestered me to buy Winterheart's Guild, their third album. I was instantly amazed by their combination of speed and melody. From the outset they never compromise, I have no idea how they survive playing a whole live set, but I intend to find out.<br />All three of their albums are superb, instantly identifiable, but constantly evolving. I consider them among the very best rock bands around, and probably the best speed metal band in the world. On this album only the ballad 'Letter to Dana' let's up the pace, and even that is excellent (though the lyrics are a bit humourous). My current favourite is 'Destruction Preventor' or perhaps 'Full Moon' or maybe 'Blank file'. Try to download samples from their website [...] and then buy all three albums. If you like power metal you will love Sonata Arctica.
B00014NE62|5.0|Other reviewers have commented on the details, and very well, so I feel like commenting on the social framework where this movie was made.  It will probably seem incredible to humans of the future, but there was indeed a time when love was confined to members of the opposite sex.<br /><br />That is to say, whenever we discovered that two people were in love, our FIRST QUESTION was to inspect their gender.  If the genders were different, then clear sailing lay ahead.  If the genders were the same, then obviously the lovers needed to be taken out and shot.<br /><br />This film, \\"Maurice,\\" comes from the novel by E. M. Forster, who avoided the penalty of being taken out and shot by his extreme discretion -- including, among other things, NOT publishing this novel until he was dead.<br /><br />Think about this.  Meditate on this.  One of the best writers of the last century decided that the world could simply not accept his tale of love.
B000028U0Y|5.0|great record - I am not a country music fan - this record is folksy and warm and really makes you feel for all those !*&amp;@(# prisoners....cocaine blues is my favourite - along with 24 minutes to go....
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life is a true achievement in our contemporary films filled with tasteless and insipid stories. Waking Life isn't a story, it's a dream, another parallel universe where the protaganist Wiley Wiggins weaves in and out of others conversations and intelligence poiting towards his own understanding of the difference between dreams and reality. What is so facsinating about this movie is the way that Richard Linklater decides to present this information in a sort of suttle dialect made by real life actors and then painted over to resemble animation. I completely was taking in awe by this film and what it had to say about the normality of what we know is real and what we choose to think is real thus creating our own universe where we can listen to others and not have any control, just floating away or levitating (which Wiley did alot in his dreams) into more mind numbing thoughts. Wiley finds that characteristics of being asleep are not being able to tell light differences and not being able to read his clock which seem to distort if he looks at it so every time he looks at the clock he is unable to tell what time it is because in your sleep, there is no time. <BR>     There definetly are some mind numbing lines in this movie such as short phrases said by strangers passing by Wiley which seem to just flutter before you and make no sense at all. If you are interested in intelligent, suttle, and imaginary movies breaking all possibility of remaining in the real world, this movie is definetly for you. It is a true marvel and work of art.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|The first Matrix can be safely classified as one the best sci-fi movie ever made. It presented the idea of man vs. machines in a whole new manner.IMHO as a Matrix fan it should have been left alone. But no! Both Wachowski and Warner Brothers decided to come up with two sequels. <BR>Reloaded:<BR>Couldn't live up to the original but has its moments. <br />Revolutions:<BR>Everthing about this movie is wrong<BR>a)At the begining the movie, we are shown that machines are also capable of having feelings and are able to love. (This totally goes against the idea of the first movie where we are shown that machines are cold ,calculative and are incapable of mercy.James Cameron painted a better picture of what machines would be like in his Terminator movies)<BR>b)The Zion action scenes were to long and repetitive. The club lobby fight scene was good but it was too short. <BR>c)The Super Burly Brawl was like watching an episode of Dragonball Z. (I know that the Matrix has influences of anime but c'mon!?!)<br />d)And the worst part the ending - Neo dies by cancelling himself with Smith and thus saving the people in the Matrix. In return the Machines will halt the war against the humans and those humans who want to leave the Matrix are free to do so. <BR>At the end The Architect questions the Oracle 'how long this so-called 'peace' would last?'. She answers him by saying 'as long as it can'. The oracle questions back on whether the machines will keep their word on freeing the humans from the Matrix. The Architect sarcastically answers that he is machine and is always trustworthy unlike humans.<br />My question to the Architect and the Wachowski Brothers is 'Who the hell in the first place created a virtual world as a blanket to prevent humans from finding out that they are born into bondage to serve as a Duracell battery?'<BR>Answer: Machines are also capable of deceit and when it boils down to man vs. machines the machines always should be the bad guys. By right all of them should have been destroyed by the end of this movie and I can safely say this is what most of us would have expected from this movie.
0385504209|3.0|After the first 350 pages (which were great), we find out that &quot;the butler did it&quot;. From that point on the book is hollow. Where's the punchline? Where's the crescendo? It seems that there was so much creative energy expended up front, that the author had nothing left for the ending. He lost his creative spark and the book sputtered to a contrived, plastic ending. I can understand why this book sold well. The first three quarters is well written, fast moving and interesting. In the end, it felt like they rushed it out with little thought to the last 100 pages. Sorely disappointed.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I think this is Britney's best album to date.  Nuff said.
B000002UJQ|5.0|You will listen to this album for very long and will each time discover something new. One of my 20 favourite albums ever, and I'm sure not the only one, obviously not.
B000002UAR|4.0|well im sure everyone has heard of the beatles. i dont know where the first time i heard of this band but i wont forget them anytime soon. the beatles have been engraved in history like a monument. They are by no doubt the most popular rock and roll band in history. and as it should be. the white album sent them off into the world and that should have been my starting point to find out about them but it wasnt. i picked revolver because it was right in the middle of all their records. it was in between the poppy white album and the psychedelic abbey road. so i wanted to get a taste of that before i went onto anything extreme. and i was really pleased i really like this album. its unlike any of the other classic rock albums i have. the songs are structured nicely and the choruses work out fine. some of the songs were not to my liking and those songs were more of the poppy songs. so i know not to head towards the white album. but anyway if you listen closely then theres a huge resemblences between the beatles and another band: Nirvana
B000002BBY|5.0|There are few albums in the rock era that can define a decade. This is one of them. A stunning snapshot of a rock band in full flight.<BR>Strong organic songs, and chemistry that can't be faked.
B00006RU5B|4.0|well its been about 7 or so years since soundgarden and not too long since rage against the machine and there was a lot of skeptisism for this band but it was all put away. audioslave may have been the album of 2003. not only did it draw in soundgarden and RAM fans but also the mainstream with their hit, like a stone. ive been a fan of soundgarden so i got this cd and i was totally impressed. neither RAM nor Cornell really changed the way they worked. if cornell didnt sing people would think it was RAM. that os what makes this album beutiful. Though its not a classic, if they put out another album im sure to pick it up
B000056H24|5.0|Very thoughtful retelling of the great and true story of Jesus of Nazereth. I like Max Von Sydow in the role and loved Charlton Heston as John the Baptist, he was very entertaining!<br />Beautifully filmed and very pious movie. Check out my other Jesus movie reviews, I love religious movies.
B000050HTO|5.0|bob dylan: the greatest solo artist would not be taking it out of proportion. the mans music has been ringing in our ears for 40 years. I decided to get this album after watching a biography on him. i wanted to get into the folk kind of music he plays. well i couldnt get an individual album because the guy has gone through so many fazes that it would be impossible for me to pick one. so i got this greatest hits. I was amazed from the first song on. although i like the second cd better the whole experience is totally gratifying. there is not one bad song on this at all.
0694003611|5.0|This is a great book - my baby loves having it read to him, and will amuse himself for minutes at a time (a big accomplishment, believe me) flipping through it on his own, too.  The pictures are clever and full of detail for discussion, and the words are simple with a pleasing rhythm.  This is one of the few books I don't mind reading over and over -- a good thing, since it's one the baby asks for repeatedly!
B0001932ZA|1.0|This movie always stunk in my opinion. Only reason I bought it on DVD was for the soundtrack for the game show and to see those hot chicks dancing. I read Paula Abdul choreographed the dance sequences. It shows. Otherwise, don't waste your money. Arnold made better movies than this one!! Predator and True Lies come to mind, while never forgetting Terminator and T2. I'm out....
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Great CD? Of course its great, its from Guns N Roses. But has got some problems: no new songs (so the fans wont buy it because already own all the songs) and several important songs missing (such as Rocket Queen, elected by a californian fan club the best song of the band, and Estranged, the masterpiece of Use Your Illusion). Guns N Roses was a band that caused a revolution in the heavy metal scene, so a Greatest Hits from Guns N Roses should have been, at least, a double CD. (...)
B000003TA4|3.0|I remember after the Geffen record release party in Seattle in 1991, my roommate had brought a promo copy of Nevermind home (it was part of the first pressing of 50,000 that accidentally edited out &quot;Endless/Nameless&quot;). Upon first listen, my initial reaction was that if this guy is gonna have &quot;sing-songy&quot; melodies like one would hear as taunts on the playground, at least make the lyrics understandable. Nevermind just didn't speak to me on any level. Otherwise, I loved how the drums sound.<br />Months later, Nevermind was toppling Michael Jackson at #1, everyone I knew had a copy, and yet, oddly, in 1992 I was able to see Nirvana in concert on a whim by merely walking up to the box office minutes before the show and buying a general admission floor ticket, not sold out. Great show, glad I went, Helmet was great!<br />I guess I found (and still find) Nevermind to be a very base album that taps into the emotional core of some people who closely identify with the angst expressions and taps into the core of the self-esteem of the peripheral wannabes who feel they must have and love Nevermind in order to be accepted by their peers. This explains why I never purchased Nevermind, but I did buy In Utero which I find more interesting to listen to.<br />If I may be so bold, I would venture to guess that Kurt Cobain, were he alive today, probably would denounce and divorce himself from Nevermind. If you think about his personality and his approach to his art and its subsequent exploitation, you know my guess is an educated one. Nevermind is what it is, an album that unleashes a national emotion expressed from 1991-1994, its influence on bands measurable to a headbanging extent. But in 2004 it's like listening to Crosby, Stills and Nash ... the sound defines a certain era too closely to ever become timeless.
B000002MTU|4.0|I'm not a fan of Eric Clapton's other stuff, however I think this cd is quite good.<br />The guitar work is ballsy and out in front just how I like it.<br />I've had it for a year and still listen to it occasionally which is a mark of quality.<br />It only gets 4 stars because there are better blues albums out there, if you like this one, or need guidance in your search for a good blues cd try anything by stevie ray vaughan.
1565117808|1.0|I could not connect with the material in this novel.  It just seemed to drone on and on without ever really getting off the ground.  The reading being done with an accent was also a little distracting, but made sense because of the character's point-of-view.  The author loves a clever turn of phrase (which got annoying quickly).  I was so bored by the novel, that I ended up getting my money back.  Sorry, Yann.
0307120007|3.0|I'm torn in reviewing this one - on the one hand, my son (9 mos) seems to love it, and quickly learned to pat the bunny, lift the cloth to play peek-a-boo, etc.  So from the baby's standpoint, it's a winner.  But looking at it from an adult perspective, I think the book is awfully old-fashioned (which may be part of the charm for some readers), the drawings aren't very engaging and the comb-binding is flimsy - I can't leave this book out with the board books, or he'll tear it apart.  If you loved this book as a kid, by all means buy it and share it with your own kid.  But in my opinion, it's not the most exciting, or even the best interactive, book out there.
B000002OX7|5.0|When anyone mentions &quot;Classic Rock,&quot; this is the band, and these are the songs, that they mean.  This is a great introduction to the Who, and to classic rock in general.  Get this album, then get &quot;A Quick One/Happy Jack,&quot; then get &quot;Who By Numbers,&quot; and then &quot;Who Are You.&quot;  Avoid &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; until you appreciate the others first.  They're a lot to swallow.<br />Hard to believe the material here was the &quot;remnants&quot; of the failed Lifehouse Project -- which, actually, was released as a radio-play on the BBC a couple of years ago.  (You can pick up a script of it in some bookstores)  I don't know why or how these songs resonate with me, they just do and i never tire of hearing them, even though several of them have become tired cliches.  But they still resonate with new, younger listeners, even after so much time has passed and musical tastes have changed so dramatically.
0060504544|5.0|I downloaded this onto my ipod for a long journey (there wasn't a category for that on Amazon, but presumably it's the same basic version as the audiotape, since Gaiman read it...)<br />I'd only read one other Neil Gaiman book, which i enjoyed enough to check this out.  Wow!  He's an amazing reader fo his own work... his gentle British accent throws the sheer spookiness of the altered everyday world into high relief.  And made some of Coraline's speeches very funny, as when having been saved from an awful fate by the mysterious cat she replies with mere politeness, though out of breath and terribly relieved.<br />The rats dancing under the bed about how they will be here when you fall (\\"you\\" meaning humanity i think) were sung in speeded up, distorted little voices that were... haunting... to say the least!  It's rare that after listening to an audiobook i feel like reading the book too but i did.. haven't gotten around to it yet but i will.<br />Gaiman's knowledge of mythology and monsters is wide-ranging, to say the least... (the other book I read was American Gods) so i don't know if \\"she,\\" the Other Mother next door, is based on a real malevolent spirit.  but it certainly felt as if she did.<br />This is a great thriller/horror story in which all of the characters and scenes are vivid and clear, not just the baddies but Coraline's family-- her distracted father and ordinary, loving mother-- the neighbors in the apartment building, including an eccentric old man training mice for a circus (who turns out to be a lot less crazy than Coraline thinks), the old ladies who used to be on the stage.  And their doubles are hilarious-- at first benignly and then... not.<br />Coraline's portrayal is marvelous too. She's plucky and bright-- much brighter than one might think-- that is to say, the narrative is matter-of-fact and though it's Coraline's pov, we don't realize just HOW bright she is until she puts her plans into action.  Gaiman wastes no time on introspection orrevealing her plans ahead of time-- which is a great strategy.  Coraline is rather classic \\"still waters run shrewd.\\"<br />Original, complete and highly recommended!
B0000027RL|5.0|Keep yout kobain dreams on a box, cause he could have some great grunge songs, but pearl jam in his masterpiece Ten, it takes you into a rock grunge voyage, making you hear some great variations of musical accords, and it ends with a special seal, that makes you hear it again and again, this 12 age cd, still rocks to me as if it was yesterday.....
B00006AL1G|5.0|That one guy who gave it 3 stars is a hater, if I've ever seen one.  For a 1.5 hour documentary, they have everything right.  This is not just a film for the DJ/hip hop freaks.  This disc has something for everyone, especially those just starting down the road of scratching.<BR>There is no way they could have incorporated the tons of DJs that the other poster listed, plus this film is trying to appeal to people who may have never known anything about DJing besides what little is shown on MTV.<BR>Any one who is not a hater will really enjoy this film.  Its smart, somewhat funny, and definitely enthusiastic about its subject.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|so i just finished watching 'lost in translation' & for me, this movie can only be described as strange. i guess the point of the movie was to kind of show you what it's like to be in a foreign place and not understand anything. none of the Japanese spoken in the movie is subtitled. so the viewer is just as 'lost' as the characters. unfortunately, i have been to Japan so all of the things that were 'weird' to the characters were just Japanese to me. Though I don't speak much Japanese, I understood a few things here and there. <BR>I think this movie portrays Americans pretty well tho in a way. Before I went to Japan (I went with a group in high school) we were warned about 'culture shock', I never felt this the entire time I was there. There were things that were different or unexpected and difficult at times with my weak Japanese, but at the same time I am a very accepting person and adaptable. <BR>I have many different nationalities in my family including Black, Mexican, Japanese, and Filipino..so I kinda have to be accepting in order to get along with my family.<br />***if you haven't seen the movie, maybe don't read this****<BR>The thing that kinda bugged me about the characters, was that they never even really tried to learn about the culture. I never saw them getting any books or trying to arrange a tour guide...all which would have been easy to do in a big city such as Tokyo. Bill Murray's character was a famous actor, he could have easily had a translator accompany him. I guess really now I think the movie wasn't about being lost in translation it was about being lost in life. These two people were lonely and lost and their connection was not only being White-Americans, it was also that they had problems in their marriages and weren't sure about their jobs. This movie is about two depressed people wallowing in their dispair.<BR>****************************************************
B0000DIXDR|5.0|In the summer of 1963 we meet Francis Houseman (Jennifer Grey), a shy, bookish, virginal, idealistic young woman, and the apple of her doctor daddy's eye. She's the sort of girl, even in her late teens, everyone still calls \\"Baby\\" and it doesn't bother her. Baby travels with her family to a spendy resort hotel in the Catskills for three weeks vacation that, though she knows it not, will change her life forever. There she meets dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). It's a classic mismatch. He's a tough, talented kid from Phillie who's led a hardscrabble life. She's, well, Baby.<br /><br />It's immense attraction at first sight, for her at least. He by contrast thinks she must be a typical worthless rich girl. Johnny and his fellow instructor/ex-girlfriend/surrogate sister Penny spend their days teaching sedate, boring dances to sedate, boring people, and in the nights blow it off at parties in the staff quarters with loud, hard driving music and the sort of sinuous, close, steamy, erotic, go for broke dancing they're really capable of. The staff quarters and parties are, of course, strictly off limits to guests - until Baby wanders in one starcrossed night.<br /><br />Through circumstances quite believable, Baby winds up having to sub for Penny at one of her and Johnny's gigs. This is important, no one else can do it, innocent people will truly suffer if Baby doesn't save the day, and with a heart as big as all outdoors she can't let that happen. Besides, it means she gets to spend time with Johnny. Problem: she's naturally awkward - or so she thinks - and doesn't know how to dance at all. In the best scenes in the film, Johnny has to teach her to dance, and these two very different people, from two different worlds, begin to fall in love.<br /><br />This is a wonderful love story, a comedy, a drama, and a musical, all rolled into one. The dance numbers are a metaphor for Baby's coming of age, her awakening sexuality, as a good girl turns into a good woman. All Baby and Johnny's dancing is done by the actors, there are no doubles. Patrick Swayze was already an experienced professional dancer, appearing among other things as Danny in Grease on Broadway. Jennifer, though she'd taken dance classes as a child, had never performed before anyone except the other kids in dance class years before - until Dirty Dancing required her to do it in front of 100 cast and crew and 350 extras.<br /><br />The DVD looks great, the quality of audio and visual transfer high, the soundtrack crisp and clear, the colors vibrant. This is all-important in a movie relying so much for its success on color and movement and a great soundtrack. Speaking of which, Dirty Dancing has the soundtrack from Hell. 14 preexisting old songs were used in the film, and another seven, maintaining the early 60s sound extraordinarily well, were written especially for it. The soundtrack sold one million copies in its first five weeks of release, rocketing to Billboard's number one slot above Michael Jackson's Thriller. Eventually two soundtracks were released, selling over 20 million units combined, and becoming the first time in history two soundtracks from the same movie both cracked the Top Ten.<br /><br />Dirty Dancing was made on a shoestring budget of 5.2 million, which would just about pay for the catering on \\"bigger\\" films not possessing one hundredth of its gentle sentimentality, style and energy. It grossed 170 million dollars worldwide. Just goes to prove you don't need a huge budget when a movie has a great script and direction, excellent choreography, talented and enthusiastic performers, and that quality difficult to define but impossible to mistake or ignore: heart.
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden did not rest on its laurels after a rousing success in the 1983 release of Piece of Mind.  The year after, the band released Powerslave, which many Maiden fans praise as arguably the band's greatest work and with good reason.  Powerslave is practically an extension of Piece of Mind but with a more melodic tone to it.  Here's a track-by-track review:<br />1. Aces High: Metal perfection, that's all you have to say to describe this masterpiece of a song.  Tremendous opening riff which sets the table for the structure of the song.  Fast, dark riffs throughout with Bruce's vocals at top-notch quality.  Awesome solos are thrown in as well. 5/5.<br />2. Two Minutes to Midnight: Like Aces High, you just know by the opening riff that you'll listen to something special. Overall, superb musicianship, deep lyrics, and a catchy chorus.  Most accessible song on this album. 5/5.<br />3. Losfer Words: Rather repetitive instrumental with a great bouncy quality about it. I personally like the bridge about a minute or less from the end where the riff goes a notch more melodic without losing its quick precision. 4.5/5.<br />4. Flash of the Blade: Impressive, promising opening riff and intro, but unfortunately, this song is rather tedious and gets old after a while, due partly to Bruce's vocals in the verses and the underlying riff.  4/5.<br />5. The Duelists: Of the two swordfighting songs, this one is vastly superior to Flash of the Blade.  It's serious business from the intro on, with a prevailing dark feel to it.  Nice, speedy riffs and drums with Bruce's vocals displaying impressive range. 5/5.<br />6. Back in the Village: Most lighthearted and upbeat song on the album, in my opinion. Sweet speed riffing on display here. The catchy chorus is what draws me to this song the most. 5/5.<br />7. Powerslave: Haunting sound effects at the beginning, but broken by some tight riffing and a headbanging drum beat.  The chorus parts are quite melodic, in slight contrast. The middlesolo starts off like To Tame A Land from Piece of Mind, but gradually turns into a raucous instrumental. Very unique tempo shifts and hence, complex. 5/5.<br />8. Rime of the Ancient Mariner: A nearly 14 minute epic track based on an epic Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem that keeps you mesmerized every time you listen to it; it never grows old. Sharp opening riff, followed by a steady arrangement of drum and guitar. The chorus is dark but retains that happy-go-lucky sing-along quality about it. As the song progresses, the instruments are more frantic up until the eerily calm middle, and turns into an uplifting tone and comes full circle with a climactic stanza similar to the very beginning.  It's hard to describe in great detail about all the styles and tempo shifts used here; you really have to listen to it to describe it.  Worth the price of purchase. 5/5.<br />In short, you can't call yourself an Iron Maiden fan without Powerslave. That plain and simple. If you're new to Maiden, this album is a fine starting point to delve into this legendary British heavy metal band.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|This movie is awesome! I went into the theater not knowing what this movie was about (never saw a preview or anything). I think maybe that's why i think I liked it so much!<br />It is extremely well-written.<br />If you are sensitive to things JUMPING out and SUDDENLY appearing, this movie may not be for you because there never seems to be a break from the scary moments. <br />Halle Berry and all the other actors are awesome!<br />The only thing I have against this movie is that the ending is way too predictable. You can figure out how it is going to end about 30 min-1 hour before the ending actually comes. <br />Watch this movie in the dark and turn off all electronic devices because, trust me, you will not want to be interrupted!
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW***<br />Halle was very good in this film. When she was first informed of her husband's death, her reaction was stunningly good acting. She did well considering this plot was full of unexplained holes. For example, if the ghost wanted her help, why did it keep attacking her? Even if she was possessed when she killed her husband, she STILL killed him, even if her husband was a killer himself, how did she get out of that one?<br />Mediocre script was saved by good photography and a wonderfully gothic institutional jail. The building looked old and gothic yet futuristic at the same time. The stop-go fast forward /motion movements of the ghost is really a lame effect and getting tiresome.. the film is saved by Halle's acting and cool settings...
0385336810|4.0|I'm a big fan of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series and was very excited to pick up her latest, even though it wasn't part of the series. I enjoyed the book, but I couldn't quite give it five stars. Emma (the heroine) is fun and likeable, but she's no Becky! This book just lacked some of the charm of the Shopaholic books and the plot was a bit much. There was just too much going on and I sort of felt like some things weren't totally resolved.<BR>Don't get me wrong, I liked the book! I definitely recommend it, I just don't recommend it as highly as I do the Shopaholic books.
0804106304|4.0|The Joy Luck Club written by Amy Tan (also the author of The Hundred Secret Senses) is an entertaining novel of four Chinese mothers and four Chinese American daughters. All the mothers get together to play Mah-jongg and talk about their Chinese lives. While the daughters try and forget that they are Chinese. Only until each daughter experiences problems where only their mother can be the one to offer advice do they really appreciate their heritage. <br />     The Joy Luck Club's short stories fit together well and each one has a meaning to think about. I found myself actually thinking of what each story meant and how it could relate to my life. However, I do not know how authentic the novel represents the Chinese culture because I do not know very much about their culture. I gave this book a 4 because it is well written and has moral value, however it did drag on in parts. If you would like to read a book about mothers and daughters that has value I would suggest The Joy Luck Club.
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|I won't go into the plot of this film, so I'll just talk about the good points and the bad.  Great suspense thriller, which has a good buildup.  The atmosphere is great as well, I guess done in a gothic style, hence the name of the film.<BR>Sadly, the film falls apart at the end.  There's no clarification on why Halle Barry's character did what she did.  And how could all that stuff be going on at the end without anyone hearing?  And of course, someone (I won't say who), shows up right after, which goes nowhere.  And the ultimate ending - 'I see dead people'.  What was this? An attempt to plant the seed for a sequel?  It was really dumb.<BR>So, while the film delivers on chills and suspense, it ultimately falls flat at the end, suffering from the problem of cliches and a lame wrap up.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Even though they are no longer together as a band, Savage Garden truly remain the worlds most beautiful gift to music and life understanding. <BR>These two immensely talented and genuinely nice, kind hearted entertainers from my home country are able to, through their deep feelings of love, care and optimism, bring you to a point in your life of true understanding.

Savage Garden will illuminate your soul and help you understand, accept and love the beauty in the pain and the pain in the beauty, in a very entertaining way.
B00018D3RI|5.0|The Striped Tomato has been burning rubber at my house every night for a week. I feel like a kid all over again and have really enjoyed watching Starsky and Hutch revived and remastered on DVD. For the amount I paid for this attractive box set of season one I have no complaints at all. In my opinion the picture and sound are great! Considering the age of the show the episodes are well done and the 5 disc's and the bonus features are fun to watch. I can't wait for the remaining seasons to come out on DVD so I can own the complete series. It's too bad we never got a Starsky and Hutch reunion show featuring one of TV's greatest cop duos. Each week they relied heavily on the word from the street from their number one informant Huggy Bear and answered to the hard nosed Captain Dobey when things went wrong. Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul will always be the greatest cop duo and the only Starsky and Hutch to ever hit the streets. Included in season one are the first 22 action packed episodes plus the series pilot. You're cheating yourself if you don't buy this fantastic show. Long live Starsky and Hutch!

0446677450|1.0|If you are looking for a book which is long on hype, but totally devoid of facts to back it up, then this is the book for you. There isn't any real information in this book, just a bunch of horn blowing, and cheerleading. The author offers no facts, nor anything concrete to lend credence to anything he says.<br />I sincerely believe the author has spent a lot of time entereing bogus 5-star reviews of his book here at Amazon, because nothing else could explain so many positive reviews for such a joke of a book! <br />I have attempted to research the author, and as far as I can tell, he has never made a dime in any business, except selling ridiculous books such as this. He claims to have gotten rich in business, but he never tells anyone exactly what business he was in. What was the name of his company? What products/services did his business offer? How many years was he in business? If he was so successful, why isn't he still doing it? John T. Reed has published an expose' on the internet. Go read it, but don't waste your time reading this book. <br />If you want more opinions of what is wrong with this book, simply scroll to the drop-down list box on this page, and select the option to order the reviews by &quot;lowest rating first.&quot;  Then read a half-dozen of them, and they will say the same thing I'm saying.<br />I'm sorry I wasted my money on this bag of wind.
B000005JA8|5.0|Got me?  Yes, Beefie, I got ya.  And thank buddha I do.  But there seem to be more than a few nay-sayers lurking 'bout the environs.  And while all are entitled to their own opinions, I would like to propose &quot;not&quot; being so analytical for once, especially when dealing with 60's psychedelia.  It's atonal, it's absurd, and at times, yes it's rather disturbing. But do you really expect the prosaic, or even coherent, from music termed &quot;dadaist rock?&quot;  Extract the wooded appendage(s) from your derrieres. Read some Joyce, observe Duchamp, Dali, etc at your local art museum.  Recall a particularly surreal dream that you once experienced.  Acknowledge that life doesn't always, if ever, make &quot;sense.&quot;   Then come back to this album.  Take it as one of the infinite ever-passing moments.  Maybe ingest some &quot;ethereal herbs&quot; while doing so (hey, it faithfully reproduces the mentality of the creators).  You just might be in love, even as your ego yawns and takes to the wing.  Perhaps you'll be moved to a greater purpose in life.  Or at least stop filling amazon with malignant reviews for this work of art/ genius from one persecuted Don van Vliet and his Magic Band.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|Granted GnR put out a few legendary songs back in the day and they had the potential to be ranked up there on the all-time greatest list of bands, but where do they get off selling an album that includes at least 3 songs that are great hits for other musicians that originally sang them??? Maybe you've heard of these bands/musicians...the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. My biggest problem with this band has always been their knack to cover another band's song and have it be the hit single released off one of their albums.<BR>...
B00000F1D3|5.0|Cher's 1998 success of &quot;Believe&quot; marks her as the oldest woman to ever have a chart topper, and a number one hit. The title track was THE pop song of 1998, putting artists like Brandy, Monica, Lauryn Hill and Britney Spears in 2nd place. &quot;Believe&quot; in my opinion is better and more danceable than 2001's hit &quot;Living Proof.&quot; She also works with Madonna's prodcuer William Orbit.  Some people say Cher copied MAdonna's dance style of &quot;Ray of Light&quot; but I sitll love both even if she did copy Madonna. I dont thinks he did though. Anyways, this includes great dance james like &quot;Taxi Taxi&quot;, &quot;Love D'Amour&quot;, &quot;All or Nothing&quot; and a remix of the 1988 classic &quot;We All Sleep Alone.&quot; If you're a Cher fan your CD collecion is NOTHING without &quot;Believe&quot;, a dance classic and the best dance/pop album of 1998!
B00009Z576|5.0|What a wonderful incarnation of Yes!  The music is fresh and their sound updated for the start of the 80's.  When you hear the bonus tracks from the 'Paris' sessions with Wakeman and Anderson you really hear how tired the compositions were that they brought into the studio.  They needed new blood at this time and got a super charge with Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes.<BR>All the original tracks on the original album stand on thier own merit. I happened to see this unit in San Antonio and it was great live as well.  I did not miss Jon Anderson, even on the other compositions from previous albums.<BR>That Jon Anderson still refuses to sing anything from this album live is petty.  Come Jon, I thought you were more spiritual than that?<BR>There are classics galore on this album. As a matter a fact, except for 'Man in a White Car', every song is an instant classic.  Again this a stealthier Yes with fresh sounds.  Sounds that do not sound dated 24 years later.  Actually 90125 sounds more dated than Drama.  I would have loved to hear a follow-up album but that was not to be.  I agree that this is probably one of Yes' top 3 albums.
B00005JMFI|5.0|First of all, this was the funniest film I have ever seen; I was in tears half way through. Yes, it is a kids' movie, but adults get to watch Will Farrel rip the heart out of Christmas by camping it up and being ridiculously sincere. Watching Farrel start a fight with a fake Santa for \\"sitting on a throne of lies\\" is about as fun as films get. <br />Those reviewers who think that this was cheesey nonsense - duh. It was supposed to be, and that is what made it so funny. And you seem to have missed the whole essence of the film.<br />Oh, and the kids liked it too.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I have read all 338 reviews and it is amazing to me how many people did not like Sheen as General Lee in Gettysburg and raved over Duvall in Gods and Generals.  I take the opposite view that Duvall was at best a mediocre Lee hardly showing any emotion at all.  I felt virtually nothing for the man in his performance as Lee.  He also is not on the screen very much.  We really never get to know him or like him.  On the other hand, Sheen as Lee is someone who truly has emotions, he cares about his troops, we see him in a human light and we like him. We see more of him in Gettysburg and we get to know him.  How can one forget the emotions of &quot;Reviewing the Troops&quot;. Gettysburg is by far the better movie of the two (proven at the box office) and Sheen's stellar performance leads the way.
0385510438|2.0|I have read most of Grisham's books and was quite excited when this one came out.  However, after reading it, I was disappointed.  Sure, the books starts off with a very interesting plot, but 1/3rd of the way through the book, the trial has ended and the rest of the time is spent following Willie around town.  I wish Grisham would go back to the writing style that got him here in the first place.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|While this album does not have the clear melodies of Metropolis or Change of Seasons, it is a powerful and masterful effort.  After listening to the album once, I was impressed but uncomfortable with the intensity of the work. I was concerned that this was a fusion album leaning toward a strong metal flavor...and actually it is. After listening a second and third time, I came to the conclusion that this album is nothing short of a display of very powerful ability...an &quot;in your face,&quot; display of musical ability wrapped in a &quot;metallic&quot; flavor and topped with a sort of &quot;here you go,&quot; to anyone doubting DT's musical abilities.<br />In addition, this album is one of the more diverse DT albums.  While powerful and intense throughout, the album will shift from a very intricate Megadeth/Project X mathematically mindblowing skull smack to a 3 piece string and piano balad.<br />One thing is certain...this is an angry album.  The shifts are fast and angry.  The vocals are descriptive and at times hateful, unusual for Dream Theater.  However, the intensity and anger which drives this album is a treat and reward for the listener.  I don't think you will find a more intricate and powerful album out right now.<br />Lastly, if you are a musician you need to own this album. The drum track is SICK good, the guitar is comparable to T. MacAlpine's Project X years, the vocals are great, the bass line is strong, and the keyboards (although not as promenant as in past albums), are exceptional.  Own this one.
0743424425|4.0|Before I read this book I was sure that a book could not be scary.  I thought only movies could keep you up at night.  But this book scared the crap out of me.  This book is excellent if you haven't read any King before, despite what King &quot;experts&quot; say.  You feel every emotion of the character.  You feel the innocence of Danny, the confusion of Wendy, and most mindblowing, the insanity and desperation of Jack.  Don't let either of those godforsaken movies mistake you, this is the ULTIMATE haunted house tale. Redrum!

B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira is an absolutely mind-blowing experiance. from the jaw-dropping animation to the innovative storyline, i simple never get tired of this no matter how many times i see it. i won't explaine the plot since it is explained plenty of times here, but i will tell you that if you are a fan of movies like The Matrix or Dark City, you will probably treasure this as one of your favorite films of all time. if you have not seen this before, i recommend getting the DVD, but if the last time you saw this was on the originol VHS from years back, you may be disappionted. the dubbing was done over again on the DVD, so some of you might wan't to stick with the older version(which is sold here by the way). but overall this is top-noch Anime and is recommended for pretty much anyone that enjoys both SciFi and Anime films alike.<br />                          10/10
B00004RF8J|3.0|Little Shop of Horrors is the definitive modern musical comedy. The music, as written by Alan Menkin, is melodic and beautiful, with some of the best lyrics in recent memory. The pacing is quick, with sharp directing by Frank Oz and great comedic performances by Steve Martin, Ellen Greene, and Rick Moranis (and the very over-rated Bill Murray, in a painfully extended cameo as a masochistic dental patient). The film knows that it isn't art, or thought-provoking, which is what keeps it from being truly campy. But what prevents it from being great is the extremely controversial, oft-discussed original ending.<BR>In the play, Audrey and Seymour are eaten by Audrey II, and the Greek Chorus sings a cautionary song to the audience. In the movie, Audrey survives, Seymour electrocutes Audrey II, and they all live happily ever after. It wasn't always so, however. Oz had filmed the play's ending, but in test screenings, the audience was angry and appalled, so Oz opted to reshoot the film for the ending as it is.<BR>In 1998. a Special Edition DVD was released with a VERY rough cut of the original ending, but it was pulled from the shelves by the producer after only two days. A second release DVD came out in 2000, sans original ending. The first issue DVD has become a collector's item of the highest degree, often selling at online auction sites for upwards of $100.<BR>Well, I own that first issue DVD, and having seen what the film could have been, I can't rate it higher than 3 stars. In that ending, Audrey's death is handled with dramatic emotion now absent from the film, never playing for laughs. There is a breathtaking Death March (Now available on the New Broadway Cast Album) as Seymour carries her body to Audrey II. Seymour undergoes a psychological spiral within minutes, before being devoured by the plant. And during the finale, &quot;Don't Feed the Plants,&quot; many enormous Audrey II's are shown wrecking havoc on a devastated New York City, blowing up cinemas, eating trains, and crushing the very symbol of our country, the Statue of Liberty (sort of). Had this ending been used, the film would have been a memorable masterpiece, but as is, it is merely a forgetable (if enjoyable) musical flop.<BR>It's a shame Frank Oz surrendered his vision to please the people. I can only imagine what the ending would have been like in full technicolor on the big screen. <BR>Let's hope for a 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition DVD in 2006 with a re-edited film containing the original ending, as promised by the producer when he had the disks puled from the shelves.<BR>Little Shop of Horrors is a fun film, if not for younger audiences. If you have 90 minutes to spare and are a fan of musical theatre, check out this modern classic-that-should-have-been, about a singing plant, a daring hero, a sweet girl, and a demented dentist.
B000001F6N|5.0|This is one of the best blues albums ever made and it came from accross the pond. Peter Green is awsome (SRV is better though by a lot soory to one of the past reviewers its just true) in fact Green is better or as good as Clapton. This album and the one with Clapton is a must for classic rock and blues fans!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|The most important album of 2003 in the UK is now the most important album of 2004 in the States.  Muse have progressed through a smashing debut in Showbiz, to a excellent sophomore effort with Origin of Symmentry (import only as of right now), to Absolution.  Both music and lyrics show a unique genius that will blow you away.
B000067CPX|5.0|this is one of those few albums where every song sounds awesome the minute you hear them. i seriously didn't need time for anything to grow on me and after one listen to this all the way through i absolutely loved it. the bass playing is just awesome and the guitar playing is absolutely infectious. the Red Hot Chili Peppers are now one of my favorite bands. you MUST by this as soon as possible. it is THAT good.<br />                       10/10
B000002ILG|4.0|Back in 1987, I used to listen to this release alot and it's probably White Lions best release. Now White Lion is also they only band to release a single that I liked and would come to hate being \\"Wait\\". Pride has probably Vito's best release playing Guitar, packed full with great solo's. Both Big Game and Mane Attraction have several good solo's and Blue Monday. Other wise he's not offering anything new on Guitar. Have always like both James and Greg their Rhythm section. Mike's ok but he does hold the band back and limits what they can play. Now I would have loved to see them with a different singer like Steven DeLong. One that can sing both the Ballads and kick it up a notch with the band playing heavy. Rather than to see a album where the vocals don't change, good songs are lost because he can't sing it or nothing's added to them. I liked the following tracks: \\"Hungry\\", \\"Don't Give Up\\", \\"Lady Of The Valley\\", \\"All You Need Is Rock N Roll\\", \\"All Join Our Hands\\", and \\"When The Children Cry\\". Although the vocals could be better on them, but it's still ok. Now I liked both \\"Lonely Nights\\" and \\"Sweet Little Loving\\" but Mike's vocals on the tracks are bad. Now \\"Wait\\", I just got tired of hearing just this song over and over on the radio and nothing else off of Pride. <BR>In all Pride has the best released songs from White Lion and should be in everyones collection. But I still would have loved to see them with a different singer and stayed away from the Pop-Metal. Because thats when they are at their worst.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Maynards is my idol now. This album is truly amazing and unconventional at the same time. I haven't listened to too much Tool but i know that if you like Tool you'll love this album. It's got a varity of amazing songs that will even put you under a sleep or blow you away. It's so very melodic and it can take you to a place no drug could. (Kinda like Darkside of the Moon does). Each Track:<br />The Package: Amazing in every respect. One of the most melodic tracks i've ever heard. In the beginning the vocals are amazing and they will take you under and show you the light, then when the guitars really hit and he starts yelling you come right back to. Amazing. 9/10<br />Weak And Powerless: Most addictive song on the album. Beautiful chorus and an amazing bass line that will make your head dance. 9/10<BR> <BR>The Noose: If you love any song on the album you'll probably love this one. Just listen and you'll understand. 10/10<br />Blue: A great song that makes you love the color even more than you can. 8/10<br />Vanishing: I liked it but not for everyone, it's out there. 8/10<br />A Stranger: Not my fav, but not bad. It's definately got it's moments. 6/10<br />The Outsider: My favorite song on the album. Not by much though. It's lyrics are totally anti-suicide, and totally meaningful. Listen closely, you'll love it. Guitar part is amazing while the bass rolls the whole way through. 10/10<br />Crimes: Just filler, really sucks. 0/10<br />Nurse: The most unique track on the album, kinda poppy but i liked it. Not for all but made for some. 7/10<br />Pet: Heaviest hardest and dirty like your college roommate (and i don't mean in the good way.) A track thats lyrics match the guitar which matching the drums and everything else. 10/10<br />Lullaby: Seems like another filler track, kinda annoying. 2/10<br />Gravity: I CHOOSE TO LIVE part 2. Amazing, like god is telling you not to give up through Maynards golden voice. 10/10<br />Buy it! Steal it! Just get it!
0064407667|3.0|If you don't like unhappy endings, you shouldn't even need to read this review because this is the glummiest book iv'e ever read. it has bad events all the time and nearly no pleasureable events.Even though it is the gloomy book , i still think it is a good book. It is fun to read how the children do everything  differently from what they used to do while they lived with teir parents. i also like the way they use to overcome the mean man they lived with and how try to make their friendshelp with out knowing that they helping or what is going on
B000069AUI|5.0|this is the album that got me into Coldplay, and i must say this is there best album so far. this isn't the type of record that has maybe a few good tracks here and there. this is the type of record that from START to FINISH absolutely perfect. anyone that enjoys bands like Radiohead, U2, The Verve, or Pink Floyd should definetaly check this out.<br />                            10/10
B00006G8K0|3.0|I've always had mixed reactions to this movie.  Unlike what some of your reviewers are saying, the whole movie took place somewhere in Mittel Europe, without Dracula ever going to England.  You remember all the scenes of the border guards, but none at sea.  The mistake that he went to England is easy to make since everyone spoke with English accents including Dracula!  They had Lee dressed much like Lugosi with the slick back hair and cape, but no tux though.  Lee's sexuality was nothing new, because that was considered to be Lugosi's breakthrough in the part.  Lee had a bland speaking voice.  His whole claim to fame was mainly hissing his way through the part.  The movie dropped everything we held dear, the bats, mist, and wolves that the Count would turn into, and all the garlic.  When they shot close-ups of his eyes he just look badly hung over, they did not glow like the Count in the book.  However, Lee was very athletic as Dracula, as was Peter Cushing as Van Helsing.  The music was rousing, and the colors lush.  Lee was no Lugosi, but when I saw James Forbes Robinson play Dracula in Hammer Studios The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires, Lee looked much better in hindsight.
B00005JMX4|5.0|i went in to this film not expecting much but this film had me laughing and entertained from start to finish. This film is a classic one for future flims to compare to. This film proves Hollywood can make good films and not just throw money at something rubbish like GET OVER IT and NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE and all the other rubbish that has come out over the last 5+ years.<br />About a month ago i was saying to a friend of mine that these film today are rubbish and hollywood need to make a modern day version of the classic FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF and here it is THE GIRL NEXT DOOR we should not compare the two because one was made in 1986 and the other 2004 but if i had to i would go with THE GIRL NEXT DOOR it is the better film because not only is the female lead hotter but this film has what FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF had missing sex appeal and the subject of females this is what makes this film THE GIRL NEXT DOOR A CLASSIC  and a film which i think in ten years time people will be saying a great and classic and entertaining film.<br />This film is 1 hour and 40 min of great fun entertainment and i would recommend this film to everybody and i would go and see it again and ther is not many films that can get me to pay twice to see it at the cinema and when it comes out on dvd a must have for any body that has a good collection of dvds.

6303534422|5.0|I first saw this when I was in 5th grade(around the time that this came out), and must have watched it about 3 million times during that year... and guuuueeees whaaaaat? 10 years later, at age 20,, I STILL LOVE IT! It has a good story that I bet everyone once related too sometime in high school... plus the songs, while corny, are very catchy(i love the \\"Open Road\\" song), and the \\"Big Foot\\" scene is hillarious :)<br />This is a great 90s classic, and a true memory of back when Disney actually made GOOD stuff [...]
0553382179|5.0|I thought I was the only person in the world who was totally overwhelmed by the CHAOS I call home, but when I read this book I found out that there are a lot of people just like me.  I found this book at a point in my life when I was totally overwhelmed.  This book has saved my life.  I am organized and my house is clean.  What more could you want?  My kids even argue over who gets to &quot;Shine&quot; their bathroom sink.  They wanted to shine the kitchen sink, but i enjoy it too much!!!  I gave them their own sink to shine.
0446608955|5.0|A walk to remember.<BR> <br />The book I read is called A Walk to Remember. This book is mainly about a guy named Landon who fell in love with an unpopular girl named Jamie. But when Landon found out that Jamie had cancer, he did anything to get help. When he found out that she was going to die. He asked her to marry him. Six months after their marriage, Jamie had died of Leukemia.<BR> <BR>      What I liked about this book was that the time period took place in the 1950's. That was different from the other entire book I have read. I also loved the story. It's also different than all the other books. <BR> <BR>What I disliked about the book was that it was too long and it took along time for me to finish. Although it was a great book. I don't really have to say anything bad about this book because I thing it's a great book. <BR>   My favorite part in this book is when Landon went to go look for help for Jamie. When he went to go find a cure. I thought that part of the book was really sweet and tragic. I also like the part where they told the problem. I thought that was really sad.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|the  storey line was good, and the historical aspect well  not<BR>true, but not looking for that.<br />this is a storey from ww2  regardless of who participated,<BR>it was entertaining and i got my money's worth.<br />das  boot  obviously was the better.<br />plenty of  stories to be told of  ww2, keep the movies coming.
B00004ZD69|5.0|If ever the apocalypse needed a soundtrack to go along with it, a dirge to mock the end of the world, I think this album would be it. There's just something inexplicable about it that seems unutterably bleak to me. I suppose one might expect bleakness coming from a group of Montrealers described as an &quot;anarchist music collective&quot;, a group whose primary mouthpiece, a man known only as Efrim, is completely unapologetic about his political views (to the point that the band rarely speaks to the press). But there is beauty amid all the cynicism, if you're willing to look. GYBE! uses a soft-crescendo-loud dynamic similar to that employed by Mogwai and Yume Bitsu, but I find their music much more nuanced than that of either of these two bands. &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists&quot; and &quot;Gathering Storm&quot;, which comprise the bulk of the opening of the album, are some of the most powerful and expressive music I've ever heard, building and building to two shimmering climaxes. &quot;Cancer Towers on Holy Road Highway&quot; creates almost unbearable tension with its frenetic string section. The album is sprinkled liberally with sampled voices that seem to float out of the ether, like a recorded message fron an Arco AM/PM at Los Angeles Airport and singing French Canadian school children. And it can surprise you when you least expect it too - the chaos subsiding for a moment, replaced by a beautiful and delicate chiming (&quot;a glockenspiel duet&quot;, according to the liner notes). &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists&quot; is one of my favorites of all time. All music should be this good.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|Enigma is undeniably the most successful name in New Age.  Undeniably.  I do own all six of Michael Cretu's cds (including the greatest hits) and both DVDs.  Romanian-born Michael Cretu  has a visionary talent in creating the dreamiest, most beautiful sound waves of our time.  <br />    His first four cds were part of what he called \\"Phase One,\\" spanning from the year of his first album's release in 1990 to his fourth in 1999 (I believe that is when it was released).  With \\"Voyageur,\\" he commences \\"Phase Two,\\" and it REALLY shows that this is VERY unlike his pervious masterpieces.  <br />    To all Enigma fans who have not yet heard the sounds of Voyageur, let me tell you that you will find very different style of music.  No longer will you find \\"Sadeness\\" or \\"I Love You, I'll Kill You\\" or \\"Return to Innocence\\".  Have you ever heard the trashy sounding EuroPop?  Well, in an interview Curly M.C. admitted that he was \\"going for a more pop-like sound.\\"  He wasn't lying.  If you like fever-inducing Pop/Trance/Techno beats then you might find something you like here.  I'm a down to earth kind of guy and I am not trying to bash Curly M.C., but listen to me - listen to the songs on this album before you buy it.  Its not that its bad, its just very different from his pervious works.<br />    Let me close by saying that I have searched far and wide and Enigma-esque music.  The closest I found is Pilgrimage and a couple of Delerium's albums are kind of like it - but nothing still tops Enigma.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This is one of my all-time favourite American films. Kevin Spacey gives a truly phenomenal performance, one which I would have to say rates amongst my top ten by anybody, ever. Others have said enough about the content of the movie; I would just like to stress that this is one DVD that's definitely worth owning because it's one of those rare movies that continues to entertain and surprise its audience with each successive viewing. I can't possibly imagine anybody being able to watch it only once.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this album very recently, but now I regret the long wait. The pop/rock feel of this album is just what the &quot;Doctor ordered,&quot; in that it is fun but artistic enough to take seriously. &quot;My Immortal&quot; and other released songs really do correctly reflect the wonderful vibe the group resonates. Very good pick for &quot;Best New Artists.&quot; The only question is now, where do they go from here? I hope they remain true during their evolution.
B00008H2LB|1.0|crap music<br />all songs are same pattern, rap verse and screaming at the chorus<br />wht d'ya expect? nothing
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I can't believe she came up with something so good finally. After all the 'Hit me' 'Oops' crap, never could anyone imagine something like this coming from Britney.<BR>It's not like the greatest album in the world or anything but it isn't crap either. <BR>There are a couple of numbers that define good music like Toxic, Everytime and Breathe on me. Some decent songs like Shadow, Hookup, Touch of my hand, Showdown, Boom boom and MATM remix. Outrageous get boring after a while and the lyrics are very dumb. Early Morning is an average song. Brave new Girl doesn't fit in this CD. I mean when you hear it the first time on the CD, you're like - 'Uh..where'd this come from?'. But it's still one funky cool song that reminds me of Britney in the late 90s.<BR> That's about the songs on th CD. They're all pop/club/rnb sort of thing. Worth buying if you want some good pop.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|The movie Babe is so completely filled with memorable and hilarious gags and scenes and one-liners that it's hard to pick a favorite. <BR>I'm a sheep pig.<BR>Baa-Ram-Ewe.<BR>The goose flapping outside the window.<BR>The farmer's wife passing out on the motel bed.<BR>Etc., etc., etc...<BR>Marvelous, marvelous tale of a little pig on an Australian farm who is adopted by the farmer's border collie and trained to herd sheep. The improbable movie turned into the surprise hit of 1995, the video has probably been bought by more families than any other film of recent memory. With its message of hope and salvation, it's a hilarious and sentimental film you can watch again and again.
0385507755|5.0|This book was given to me from a drug recovery counsellor, I was told it might help me better understand what it feels like to be an addict.I was touched after reading this book.  I was abe to see life in a different way. Being in a relationship with a recovering addict I was able to relate with James's story.I couldn't put this book down. I wish I could meet James Frey, hug him, and tell him i'm pround of him. I highly reccomend this book.
B00006WUWN|4.0|The title says it all, mayBe if she wasn't in it it would have been a classic. Her acting skills are horrible, why would they bring her on for this role. Without her in the way the film still stands as a very funny and imaginitive comedy. All the characters from the past show up in this all out comedic warfare. Including one of my favorite actors seth green returns for his brilliant preformance. Jay rouch did an excellant job directing this film, and mike myers and michael mccullers wrote a very funny script. The only thing that seems strange is that with only two executive producers there are eight producers, two of which are writer/actor mike myers and demi moore. but with that aside take beyonce out and you have a comedy classic.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Yes, we all know rock like this has been done before over and over........But come on what hasn't?<BR>This is a pretty good cd from a &quot;today&quot; rock band. I'm sorry i'll take the redo twist of 70's and 80's rock stuff over the today's rock POP crap ola any day. Most of today's new rock bands have ZERO talent and it all sounds the same too. This band JET has the talent of grabbing a lot of goodies from the past(BEATLES,STONES.WHO,KINKS,IGGYPOP,BLACKC ROWES) and making it sound pretty darn good. GET BORN is one of the best rock albums from a &quot;today&quot; rock band in awhile. Or maybe I am just old?
B000002KH3|5.0|Without a doubt Van Halen's self titled debut is one of influential albums ever made for guitarists everywhere. For years after it's release everyone was trying to imitate Eddie Van Halen's playing style <br />(especially his two hand tapping technique). I don't think any one player had as much influence on what would become eighties rock as much as Eddie Van Halen. <BR>But despite what some may say Van Halen is so much more than Eddie's guitar playing. Let's not forget Eddie isn't the only Van Halen in the band. His brother Alex Van Halen isn't exactly a slouch on the drums. Michael Anthony's bass playing was nothing to sneeze at. Then there is David Lee Roth.. one of rock and roll's most charismatic and energetic frontmen of all time. C'mon, Van Halen wasn't the same after &quot;Diamond Dave&quot; left. Sure they had hits with Sammy Hagar ...but nothing that could equal the power of the classics found here. &quot;Runnin With The Devil&quot; and &quot;Ain't Talkin' Bout Love&quot; are among hard rock's greatest tunes. The bouncy &quot;Jamie's Cryin&quot; and hot rodded version of  <BR>the Kinks &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; are sure to get any dancefloor hoppin. <br />But one of the albums most popular tracks has no words at all.It was probably Eddie Van Valen's guitar solo &quot;Eruption&quot; that dropped the most jaws. To this day every young rocker wants to learn &quot;Eruption&quot;. Along with AC/DC'S &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; and Led Zep's &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, &quot;Eruption&quot; remains one of those timeless classics that every six stringer has to bother guitar store clerks with atleast once. It's not easy to take rock guitar to a new level and it's even harder to reinvent rock guitar but Eddie Van Halen managed to do both ....and for those who dimissed Eddie as simply an exhibitionist ...you obviously weren't listening.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|WrestleMania XX, live from Madison Square Garden in New York City, was by far one of the greatest WWE events of all time. For five full hours, wrestling fans all over the world were able to witness history unfold before their eyes on a night that marked the end of one era, and the beginning of a new one. Everything from the matches to the special appearences were awesome, and as a fan who was at MSG that night, I can honestly say that not a single person left the Garden dissapointed. I have watched every single WrestleMania live since 1985, and I can honestly say that this years twentieth anniversary spectacular not only lived up to all the hype, it far surpassed it. <BR>Here are some of the biggest highlights of the event:<br />- John Cena defeats the Big Show for U.S. Championship, Cena's first title win in the WWE.<BR>- Christian pulls the upset by pinning Chris Jericho. Afterwards, Trish Stratus betrays Y2J and joins forces with Christian.<BR>- The Rock 'n Sock Connection lose to Evolution. The victory further puts over Evolution, while ensuring that the Randy Orton/Mick Foley rivalry is far from over.<BR>- The 2004 WWE Hall of Fame inductees were presented to the sold-out crowd.<BR>- In the first-ever Playboy Evening Gown match, Torrie Wilson and Sable beat Stacy Kiebler & Miss Jackie. Although as any guy who saw this match can tell you, there really were no losers!<BR>- Goldberg defeated Brock Lesnar. It was both of their last nights with the company, and every single fan at MSG knew it. After the match, special referee Stone Cold Steve Austin stunned both of them right out of the WWE. <BR>- Jesse 'the Body' Ventura announced that he may run for President in 2008, and special guest Donald Trump pledged his full support to him if he actually does.<BR>- Victoria retained the Woman's Championship against Molly Holly. As part of a pre-match stipulation, Molly had to shave her head completely bald.<BR>- Eddie Guerrero defeated Kurt Angle to retain the WWE Championship. One of the best matches of the night.<BR>- In my personal favorite moment of the night, The Undertaker returned to the WWE as the classic 'Dead Man' character. He had one of the best entrances I have ever seen, complete with his original music, smoke/fog, thunder, bells, the torch-carrying Druids, and even his original manager Paul Bearer. Best of all, Taker went on to extend his WrestleMania win streak to 12-0 by defeating his own brother Kane. A great overall moment.<BR>- Chris Benoit achieved his life-long dream by winning the World Heavyweight Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Shawn Michaels. Easily the best match of the night. Afterwards, WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero came to the ring to congratulate his pal Chris on his huge victory. The show ended with both of them raising eachothers arms in the middle of the ring.<br />I highly recommend that wrestling fans of all types purchase this DVD as soon as it comes out.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|My review title kind of sums up some of the obnoxious feeling that pervades this film. \\"Wow, those Japanese sure are strange and quirky! Look at how different they are from us! It's amazing!\\" This kind of attitude reminds me an agape-mouthed tourist whose never left Iowa abroad for the first time. The jokes that come from this may be funny for the Mad TV crowd, but left me with a sour feeling. \\"Wow! It takes Bill Murray five minutes to figure out the hooker is saying 'Rip my stockings' because her 'r' sounds like an 'l.' Hilarious!\\" Ugh. <br />This movie also trades heavily (I would say shamelessly) on the North American fascination with Tokyo and many things Japanese - the glaring light show of a Ginza, Shinjuku, or Roppongi, the vending machines that dispense panties advertised as \\"used by schoolgirls\\" for fetishists, the rapid transit rails that are a wonder to behold, the anime, manga, and video game culture, etc. The problem is, this movie views Tokyo, in my view, with the same kind of slack-jawed provincialism as a 14 year old who just finished watching Evangelion. Not good, especially when you're appealing to a crowd with a bit more select tastes.<br />Through this, we see a manipulation of Tokyo as fabulous backdrop that fills a gaping void in the movie - you can imagine this movie would completely fall flat in another locale. While setting is important, I personally don't feel it should overshadow the characters, *particularly* in a (should be) character-driven movie such as this. Okay, we've been treated to the Frommer's Guide to Tokyo onscreen. This is not why I came to see the movie. And certainly not for the type of humor all too prevalent throughout the movie. I half-expected Bill Murray to start stretching out his eyes and murmuring \\"Me so solly!\\" like some 50s comic.<br />Now, that said, once you get past all this, we come to an interesting character study, and this *is* worthwhile. But I'm not enthralled with the acting as our others, here's why. Ifelt Scarlett Johanssen was unconvincing in her role (casting an 18 year old, as she was at the time, in this role, was a bad idea in retrospect), and too many of her lines rang false.<br />Bill Murray, on the other hand, delivered a fine performance. Replace Johanssen, you still have a movie. Replace Bill Murray, you have nothing. If I have a fault with Murray here, it's that he may not be stretching himself that much in this role - this sardonic, humorously self-depricating man he plays is not that far off from many of his previous roles.<br />Now, with that said, the writing, while a bit sparse at times (coming from the school that's it is better to say too little than too much) is quite good, some of the best of 2003. Much of it does ring true, and it's nicely bittersweet without veering off too much into mawkishness. But as I stated above, some of the other grating elements of this film prevent me from rating it higher than three stars.
B00005JL96|5.0|Unlike the usual Disney movie, Lilo and Stitch has seemingly broken the mold, of the Princess formula. 8 year old Lilo and her pet \\"dog\\" Stitch are certainly no Prince and Princess. The whole story is charming, as well as hilarious. Like any Disney Film you find some lessons to be learned as well. The visuals of Hawaii are lush and colorful watercolors which is a refreshing change from the computer animation that is seemingly taking over the genre. I would recommend this movie across the board to anyone young and old!
B00008S2VG|3.0|To say the least, I was not as happy with American Life as I have been with past Madonna albums.  I don't dislike it completely, of course.  There are certain songs on this album like &quot;Hollywood,&quot; &quot;Die Another Day,&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; that I love.  But, there's something about this album that just isn't the same.  It's not so much that she has changed her look (we're all used to that by now), rather, it's the whole attitude she has in the album.  It's really hard to explain what I mean in words, but when compared to let's say her album Ray of Light, for example, the sound and feel to the lyrics are not as &quot;deep&quot; anymore.<br />On a more positive note, &quot;Hollywood&quot; is a great dance song for everyone.  If I could compare it to another one of her songs, it would be &quot;Vogue.&quot;  &quot;Hollywood&quot; is like the &quot;Vogue&quot; of 2004.<br />&quot;Die Another Day&quot; has that dark feel to it, yet produces a great sound and beat.<br />&quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; could have done well on her album Music, but hey, no worries.  It's still a great tune.<br />In short, the question remains, &quot;J-MAN, should I buy this album?&quot;  Answer:  If you don't own at least three Madonna CDs yet, don't let this one be your first choice.  Get associated with our material girl through her other albums first.  Otherwise, your view of her might change dramatically.
B000002HEM|3.0|Natalie Merchant was truly the force behind this group. Luckily Merchant's voice raises this collection up from the formulaic collections of unplugged that have come before. (Think Eric Clapton etc) Trouble Me, and Because the Night are the two main reasons to buy this cd. If you don't have a love of the 10,000 Maniacs, you would be better to pay to download those two tracks. If you want to enjoy Natalie Merchants voice, please look at her solo debut Tigerlily.
0385504209|4.0|This book is like watching a really interesting program on the History channel.  It presents a number of thought-provoking historical and theological concepts which many people may not be familiar with.  As a story, the plot itself is somewhat trite and the characters are made of cardboard.  Nevertheless, the ideas and puzzles presented through its staccato-pacing are what make the book worthwhile.<br />Religious fanatics should probably avoid this book.  It uncovers uncomfortable truths about Christianity.  Come to it with an open mind, and remember that this is a work of fiction.  Dan Brown likely stretched facts (all well within the range of poetic license), but many of the ideas are plausible.  You will probably find yourself googling for the information presented in the book, just to learn more for yourself.  Possibly, this book will be your gateway to other fiction in this domain, including such works as Focault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco.  In my opinion, any book that triggers you to think, learn and read more is a success.
B00005JMCT|3.0|American Wedding, like its two predecessors, is, to some extent, reviewproof.  After all, teen sex comedies are rarely ambitious enough to try and earn critical praise.  Nonetheless, while it would be silly to judge American Wedding as a piece of art, it is fair to assess it on its own merits within its genre, and on that level, it is a decent, though not great, movie.<br />The first movie in the trilogy - American Pie - was rightly regarded as a very good movie.  While it had some of the standard teen movie humor, it also was something better, primarily because of the characters who were both likable and not the standard cliches.  By the third movie, however, most of the characters who were so endearing before are either gone or relegated to minor roles.  Instead, the less serious characters - ones such as Finch and Stiffler and even the two principals in Wedding - Jim and Michelle - are the ones in the spotlight now.  The result is a movie that still has some good points, but is also a pale imitation of the original.<br />The principal good things about the movie is the generally likable characters and the avoidance of some of the usual wedding-movie cliches.  In particular, I find it refreshing to have a movie without the standard romantic crises arising from dumb misunderstandings; at least in this movie, Jim and Michelle never really waver from their commitment to marriage; the complications come from other events.  On the other hand, the humor is often sporadic and even the events designed to get the biggest laughs - such as one involving two dogs and a cake - are hit-and-miss.<br />For fans of the other movies in this series, this movie may be worth watching, but because it is dependent on those earlier movies, I cannot recommend it to anyone unfamiliar with the earlier films.  For the fans, however, this is a three-plus star effort, a bit above average but nothing really great.
0684833395|5.0|Don't read this book because it is a classic.  Read it because it is damn good.<br />Catch-22 is the type of book that will make you laugh, make you cringe and make you think. This is a story that will enchant you with its characters, its humor, its descriptions and its truths.<br />Catch-22 is not a pacifist rant.  The morality of fighting World War II isn't the issue here. It is about the abuses of power, politics and hypocrisy that occur within military organizations during war.  Yossarian is a man who has already gone beyond the call of duty for his country, yet is forced beyond his breaking point by men who are more interested in wealth and power than in concluding the conflict.<br />In our lives and work, most of us observe people making decisions driven by personal ambitions and ego to the detriment of all around them.  Catch-22 is a dark comedy of those traits when they play out in the most lethal business of all:  the business of war.<br />Heller's writing style breaks many of the literati's proscribed rules.  He makes heavy use of repetition, along with strings of adjectives and adverbs.  Although the story spends a lot of time exploring the characters, it does little to develop its nonlinear plot. Nevertheless, I found the rhythm of his writing hypnotic and engaging. You'll find yourself turning the pages to learn more about the people of the story.
B00005JKC3|5.0|The Hulk is based on a comic book hero from marvel like,&quot;spiderman,&quot;daredevil&quot;, characters like that. Hulk's real identity is &quot;Bruce Bana&quot;, a scientist who works for the government, and is testing a nuclear weapon. A friend of his, but then gets in the way and Bruce moves him out of the way and gets hit by the \\"GammaRay\\". Bruce's dad has been giving him shots since he was a baby for he could be protected by any government experiments. Then the rage is released, so then every time Bruce gets annoyed, he becomes this ferocious Monster. The government then wants the Hulk for they could do testing on him and stuff. It is a real knockout. Not better than &quot;Spiderman&quot;, but is still really cool. <br />This 2 disc set includes behind the scenes on the amazing &quot;Dog Fight&quot; scene. It also includes deleted scenes that actually should have been taken out. It also has an interview with Stan Lee, which is pretty funny. It also has full-length commentary by Ang Lee. He is a weird choice to direct this film, but still pulls it off. Going from &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot;, to a action packed film! The weird thing that this DVD didn't have but should've, was the teaser that they showed before showing the film &quot;Spiderman&quot; in the theater. Or they at least should have showed the trailer if they had one. <br />Another really cool thing about this DVD is, if you have an xbox, put in the first disc in first, and you can play a complete level of hulk the game. It is real cool. Another question in my mind is &quot;why did Ang Lee decide to direct this film in 1:85:1. Shouldn't it have been 2:35:1? But I guess it can work that way. I don't really get why people hate this movie, its not that all great but its still pretty cool. Well watch it for your self and find out.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Absolution was my choice for the best album of 2003.  Released last year as an import here in the States, the album finally recieves a proper release here.  Absolutely go and seek this one out.  It's a bold and beautiful album from THE best rock group in the world right now!  That's all there is to say.  STOP reading, go, buy, NOW!   <br />NOTE-Muse does NOT sound like Radiohead nor are they \\"imitators\\" of Radiohead as some lazy rock critics would have you believe.  Apart from Matt Bellamy's penchant for falsetto vocals, they sound nothing like the Oxford UK group, THEY'RE FAR BETTER!!
0140288503|5.0|This is the History of one of the most hazardous military missions in the Clinton Administration, because Somalia in 1993 was a contry in civil war and the Somalian militia was trainied to figth to the last, but in the other side it was the Task Force Rangers who includes the US Army Rangers and the Special Forces team Delta who went to trap the warlord Mohammed Farrah Adid. This book is great because you look the live of 100 soldiers traped in a city with all aingast they and how survivie only thust in theirs comrades, but i have read the spanish version of it nad i like it. Thanks to this book i can find some boys can be heroes just for saving the man next to they and many other things you never imagine like the doctor who try to save the live of a young Ranger with a wound in his tigth, or the pilot who has been trated well by his captors. This book show this : &quot;I will never leave a fallen comrade in hands od the enemy&quot; like said the Ranger creed.<br />I highly reccomed this book in first place and later the movie.
B000002MNR|5.0|If you are reading this then maybe you are a Knopfler fan who is curious about Mark's film work but cannot quite absorb that genre, DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR!!!,this is unbelievable!! From the gorgeous wanderings of the melodies from Cal and Local Hero to the aching strings of Last Exit ,its all very, Very moving.
B00005JLCI|4.0|4.5 stars. Well, I first watched this a long time ago when it was a new release on video.  I remember thinking at the time that there were a lot of interesting ideas, the most ambitious of which was filming the \\"entire\\" play.  So, instead of relying on my failing memory, I rented the film again before writing this review.  The interpretation of many of the lines in the play take on a new context I hadn't seen before, so for that I was pleased.  But what I did not like was director Kenneth Branagh's tendency towards sensationalism.  Like when Hamlet meets and speaks with his father's ghost.  Instead of being a creepy revelation, it is overblown with earthquakes and dry ice and a booming score that threatened to drown out the dialogue.  Another was the \\"not so bloody\\" ending to the play.  Most of it is staged well, but throwing a rapier a hundred feet from a balcony and spearing the King's arm into the throne was more than a little far-fetched.  However, those criticisms aside, most of this films shines.  The production value of this film is superb.  The costumes and sets are all extravagant, and the elegant photography(complete with complex tracking shots) captures it all in fine detail.  The acting, for the most part, is first-rate as well.  The supporting cast is excellent, and except for Billy Crystal and Robin Williams, who both seem to be going for laughs rather than act, the rest give noteworthy performances.  The main actors are all outstanding.  In particular, Kate Winslet and Derek Jacobi are magnificent, and I can find no flaws in their work here.  While about 95% of Kenneth Branagh's performance is also excellent, he has a tendency to over-act in a couple scenes.  Overall, my favorite work of his remains \\"Henry V.\\"  This \\"Hamlet\\" is a splendid version of the celebrated play, overbearing at times, but for the most part, exceptional.  Thank you.
0618002219|5.0|\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is the prequel to his blockbuster hit \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  A must read for anyone who is a LOTR fan like me.  This epic fantasy introduces the world of hobbits in Middle-Earth and one in particular Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.  Bilbo lives comfortably on six meals a day in his hobbit hole under the hill in Bag-End.  Not one to consider himself adventurous Bilbo with the nudging of his friend the Wizard Gandalf the Grey accompanies thirteen dwarves (Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur) on a quest to reclaim their lost treasure from the dragon Smaug in the Lonely Mountain.  Known as the Burglar Bilbo encounters many strange creatures including monsterous trolls, pony eating goblins, wargs, wolves, giant eagles, wood elves, man eating spiders, a talking dragon and Gollum.<br />While lost in the Misty Mountains, Bilbo finds a golden ring.  To hearing the cries of the creature Gollum he puts the ring in his pocket.  Gollum has lost his precious (the ring).  Upon meeting, Bilbo and Gollum strike a deal.  They will play a riddling game.  If Bilbo wins, Gollum will lead him out of the mountains.  If Gollum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo.  Although Bilbo wins, Gollum has no intention of helping Bilbo when suddenly the ring finds its way to Bilbo's hand and puff...he disappears.  He becomes invisible.  Bilbo uses this ability to escape the Misty Mountains with its goblins and many other pickles he will find himself in throughout the rest of his adventure to Mirkwood, Lake-town and the Lonely Mountain.<br />Although this is a fantasy novel, it is not necessarily appropriate for small children.  It is more for adults, teenagers and older children.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This movie is possible the worst I have ever seen ,that tried to come off as serious anyway.First of all the charecters were not the slightest bit interesting.Not to mention that the story had way to many gaps and holes big enough to fly the death star through. Since when is the indicator of having the force how many paracites you have in your blood?!?You get lice and the force is with you?I thought you had the force because you were in tune with the universe right???Evidently not. Jar Jar Binks was the stupidest part of the whole film. Reminds me of some whacked out,ganja smoking jamacian. Not to mention that they win a war with basically sticks and stones. This movie is a major sellout of the times, good old left wing america thinking that no one possible could be any smarter,stronger, or more important then another. In so many words It Sucked....
B00004XPPB|4.0|Donnie Brasco is a modern classic.  The script is realistic, the direction is focused and the sets are atmospheric.  Is Donnie Brasco a good movie, Fuhget about it.
B0000UJL96|3.0|First off, the movie it's self is rated 5 stars and no less, but this format stinks.  If your gonna show it in widescreen show it in anamorphic and no less.  Only rich people own HD-TV's.  The average person can't afford them.  SO either show it in anamorphic(I can live with the black lines if I get to see the WHOLE picture) or full screen(the reason I bought a 27&quot; TV was to see it in 27 INCHES).  Otherwise don't bother.  If your wondering about it in widescreen, amazon has missrepresented this, it isn't wide screen anamorphic(as in the theater) it is 16.9 &quot;enhanced&quot;, thier's a difference you know.
B00005A46T|5.0|[...]This album is really good and of course REALLY HEAVY.Except the song IOWA and GENTLY all the songs are<BR>great.The best thing of slipknot is their screaming and drumming.U WONT REGRET BUYING THIS CD [...]<BR>I'll also recomend u to buy the DVD 'Disasterpieces'.
0716703440|5.0|I used to drool over this book in the university bookshop. It was, by far, the best laid-out textbook I had ever seen. It was expensive, even by the standards of 1980, the year I eventually bought it.<br />This probably disqualifies me as an Amazon reviewer, but I have to admit that I've never read it. I was a mathematician by degree, and am now a writer on marketing matters. Whenever I need inspiration on how to lay out and explain a complex concept which needs both words and diagrams, this is the book I return to.
B00005JN1L|5.0|this was one great movie. johnny depp was funny and i wasn't prepared for the end. john tuturro as the southern hick was great and a little creepy and weird. this movie had some of johnny depp's dark humor in it. this movie is worth seeing.
B0000062FJ|5.0|I used to be a G. Hits Santana fan. No more. This album is is hot and toasty. Every song makes you want to pick up a guitar and join in. The sound is incredible. A remaster so good you want to eat it. In fact if you are into three minute songs skip this one, it is heavy on the jam!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I LOVE SHANIA!!.  I have practically every CD of her's, my friends do not like her that much.  I bought this DVD cause I tried recording the TV version of it when it came out, the problem was that I had to go to work, and my brother changed the channel from the concert to the news.  This DVD is the best, she is energetic, beautiful, and just fabulous.  I love her and her bands new look.  I saw her at the AMC Awards and I loved her outfit on the carpet and her outfit when she sang......She is just a SUPERSTAR!.  This DVD has great audio, a lot of people are saying the audio sucks, it all depends on what you have it connected to.  I had mine connected to my stereo, so it sounded great, and the picture is great.  Crystal clear........this is a must have for any Shania fan.<br />--Andrew
0385510438|1.0|Grisham, you've gotta be kidding. I beg my fiancee to let me buy this book -- as we are on a shoestring budget-- and she relents and this is what I get? I love Grisham. I hated this book. I read it and realized it was good for something -- to cure me of my insomnia.  <BR>This is why I'm writing in my spare time. I'm tired of picking up a book in hopes of it being decent and finding out it's a waste of time. I mean, it wasn't even fun to read. That's all I ask for, something halfway entertaining. <br />And the sad thing is, the next Grisham book that comes out will be purchased by me again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The only problem watching this show was that with each new episode I watched I became more and more annoyed/angry that it would end so quickly. This is a great show with wit, action, romance, drama and all the elements that make anything worth watching.
B000005JA8|1.0|Here's a quick compendium of some of beefheart's quotes - worthy of the short-bus:<br />\\"People use funny toilet paper because it means they're rich if it's perfumed. I think perfumed toilet paper causes rectal cancer. You can almost judge how screwed up somebody is by the kind of toilet paper they use.\\"<br />\\"They're about to poke their genitals into our cream cheese moon right now. That's my eye; the moon is part of me. Why don't they poke it in the sun? They're not very daring.\\"<br />\\"It was a very ecological album. I was just trying to eke out a little logic.\\"<br />\\"The war is a pimple on the pope's pet dragon.\\"<br />The man is just a burnt-out, old buffoon who got by on the strength of a bunch of half-thoughts and nonsense because no one had the guts to tell him he's boring.  Do the above quotes suggest to you that beefheart was some kind of genius?  Of course not.  Any teenage girl on LSD could come up with most of them.  A string of stupid puns, bad metaphors, lousy construction, and poor execution are far from profound in prose or in music.  This album is for pretentious chumps only.  Everyone else would be well served to avoid it like the plague.
B00005B36H|5.0|Every song on this Albumn is written with enough complexity to keep the songs interesting through out their entirtey which can sometimes be fairly long. all of them are fast pace enough to keep the attention of an xtreme ADDer. overall this album is one of my favorites in my entire collection and a must have for every collection. I've actually gone out and made my friends get this album because its just that good.
B000053VAZ|5.0|I love this feel-good movie! It's a special treat to watch Sam, Johnny Depp's quirky, sweet and child-like character, who makes grilled cheese sandwiches with an iron and entertains at a park with his impressive Buster Keaton-like routines. He looks and acts like someone who walked in from another era, maybe even another planet. Watch Depp's facial expressions -- intense and hilarious! <br />There are heavy moments, such as the bus scene: When the romance between Sam and Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) is misunderstood, forcing the pair to run away, Sam comes face to face with the reality of mental illness as Joon becomes severely agitated with the voices in her head. But he never gives up on love, finding a way to get to Joon at the mental hospital by dangling acrobatically just outside her room from a window washer's perch (my favorite scene). And yes, there's a happy ending. <br />I watched this movie with my husband and our children (ages 10 and 12). If you plan to watch Benny &amp; Joon with kids, be aware that bad words are used a couple of times, and there's a romantic scene between Sam and Joon that's slightly steamy but not distasteful. Overall, though, the touching story, dialogue, and humor make this a fine movie to watch with kids over 9 years of age (younger kids would probably find it boring). <br />Creative story with fun characters! Some of the almost surreal scenes will replay in your mind to make you smile and even laugh out loud.
B000003S0D|4.0|Lizard is quite a fine album.  Coming in during a very fertile period for Crimson music - this is the third album - it captivates, and says to the listening world that Crimson was a band for real.<br />The first album In the court.. was a Mega hit.  The second, a beautiful collection of power songs crafted and played like no other group of musicians (Wake of poseidon).<br />I recommend this album because it is an incredible registry of something that could've been done years later and sound current.<br />This and the other early 70's Crimson records give a good introspect as to music that still manages to intrigue, enchant and give your speakers at home a good workout.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a very discriminating (picky) viewer.  For example I'm one of those rare viewers who chose not to give G.Lucas money for the new SW films (because I was so unhappy with the third movie).  I rarely watch television any more because I've given up hope that anything good will ever be allowed to air.<br />My sister-in-law sent us these Firefly DVDs - we had never seen the series when it originally aired.  They are fantastic from the first moment to the last.  Commentary and extra features are mere cream on top of the real product, which is the series itself, seen here as it was intended to be seen, not reordered and ruined by soulless movie executives who wouldn't know great human work if it fell in their lap, as Firefly did.<br />WARNING:  If you watch this series you will want more!  (fortunately, Universal just started production on a movie!   see Firefly fan sites on the web for news)<br />I have purchased seven sets as gifts already and will probably continue to do so.  FORGET that they label this &quot;science fiction&quot;.  It's great science fiction, which means you don't care if it is or isn't science fiction.  Buy it.  Watch it.  You will not be disappointed.
B000002HRE|1.0|I swear by god that the first time I heard this record I feel asleep, the second time I wanted to return it... the third time I was looking for my reciept so that I can in fact return it... and since I didn't found it, I just sold it at a local store. This album is everything Metallica shouldn't be:<BR>Slow: Metallica used to play fast music to bang your head to and maybe even mosh to. Now we have all this power ballads and slow hard rock songs good for rock radio that are good to.... yawn.<BR>Weak: No distortion and heavyness what so ever. The heaviest song on this album would be a slow pathetic ballad on a real METAL album.<BR>Boring: other than Fuel and Low Man's Lyrics, all the songs sound the same. No changes, just the same song done with few different variations. can someone tell &quot;carpe diem baby&quot; from &quot;Slither&quot; or those from Load's songs? or even the black album's slow ones?<BR>Just simply bad songwriting, I hope this album was just a whole bunch of left overs from load since they seriously suck, no matter what band would have made it, this songs are just plainly not good, and I do not think it was worth my money to be totally sincere.<BR>Hightlights: The pictures and the artwork<BR>Lowlights: yawn....
B00006F7S4|4.0|There should have been a warning that came with this CD. I expected it to be just as upbeat and fast and happy as his previous work. So when I first flipped in Becks CD I was completely turned off by it and just threw it in a corner to be forgotten. BUT! I found it again recently after about a year and I have a new view of the album. And I am enjoying it very much.<BR>Get this album but be expected to get something more mellow and sad at times.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|I have nothing against all of this new music, but it just doesn't fit my style... it's all being done already. Buy the original, there is no need for soemone to try and re-do the 70's hits, other than to sell to people who is stuck in them. No talent playing, song writing, or nothing at all. This is plain crap. i hope this trend is over soon and it will be another pityfull memory like Disco, New Wave and Glam.<BR>Highlights: do you wanna be my girl is pretty catchy<BR>Lowlights: this is just a plain waste of dollars.
B00004U2G1|3.0|I play the sacd and the two channel CD back to back and can tell little difference, except that just maybe the 2 channel version has more dynamic range.<br /> Feeling ripped off in Rockford.
B00005QIPH|1.0|one chords sections for minutes... boring vocals, boring beats, no talented musicians playing what might be the most boring music ever made. Sorry but this is definitely not worth your dollar. So what's all the buzz about? They are different, but that doesn't mean better, in this case it means worse. Sorry but I really didn't like this record.<BR>Highlights: nothing<BR>Lowlights: the boring riffs.
B000060P79|3.0|Ok now this cd may not be the greatest thing to hit the shelves but it just makes me sick seeing everyone giving it bad reviews stating what \\"punk\\" is and what its not. for all you \\"hard-core punks\\" out there im just saying dont force your opinions on others. yes you can say if the cd is good or not but dont just say crap about it when its not real \\"punk\\". <BR>this cd is pretty good. a few songs are nice and catchy while others are just ok. i recommend listening to some of the songs beofre purchasing this cd.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|I bought this album the day it came out, listened to it intently, and after a week of raving about how damn good it was, I realized that I wasn't getting anything out of it, there is nothing genuine about it. <BR>  Then I started listening to alice in chains, whom these guys ripped off to no end(Just check out the other side) listen to running blind full, they use the same chords as the aic classic &quot;nutshell&quot;)<BR>  As I read earlier, there is influence, then imitation, godsmack imitates, and poorly, they are what STP was to Pearl Jam, Erna's mannerisms live even liken to Layne Staley.<BR>  But back to this album, if you are 15 and angry, maybe this will do something for you,  lyrics are pitiful, annoying and relentlessly repetitive.  The album is overproduced to a point where the drums are incomprehensible.<BR>  The guitar solos, you call these guitar solos? 30 seconds of a wa wa peddle? The fact is, these guys aren't talented at all, they aren't original at all.<BR>  all the songs are about the same thing, people using him, its getting old, while Awake actually benefited from a little variety lyrically, the song structure remains the same, and as Zeppelin would say, the song remains the same.<BR>   They steal the name from AIC, the logo, sadly imitate the sound, making acoustics EP's, what's next? How can you people in good conscience listen to these guys? there's not a genuine or creative bone in their body.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Look at Britney's second album, the Oops one. It has a number of musical and lyrical powerhouses, including \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Lucky,\\" and very few \\"OMG these are such slutty lyrics\\" songs.<br />Then look at her third, self-titled album. I'm still in awe that songs as good as \\"Overprotected\\" and as bad as the Stupid Slave Song could even come from the same artist, much less the very same album. It's kind of like how I still can't believe that a song as good as \\"We're in This Together Now\\" and one as bad as \\"Closer\\" can both come from the same artist (NIN).<br />Now look at her fourth album, this one. I don't think there's one good song on it, and the two videos that have come out of it have both been exceptionally slutty (although Toxic was only slutty in a funny, grope-him-so-he-won't-notice-you-swiping-his-wallet kind of way). I want to hear about your personal issues, not how you get yourself off.<br />And for those of you who keep complaining about her voice, I have two words for you: Stevie Nicks.
B000002H97|5.0|Ok I began listening to metal in 1993 when i began listening to a lot of music period. i bought this album in august that year and instantly realized that this band rocks. I then bought all their previous albums like kill em all, ride the lightning (my personal favorite}, master of the puppets, and justice for all. I must say this collection of Metallica is by far enough for me to at one time call this my favorite ban. I started collecting their t-shirts and what not. <BR>-KILL THEM ALL (1983) great thrash debut from the band real edgy and riff oriented speed metal<BR>-RIDE THE LIGHTNING (1984) my favorite true deep and personal album from the band. really showed what a great metal band should be.<BR>-MASTER OF PUPPETS (1986) same style as ride the lightning with lots of emotion and good pace metal. RIP Cliff Burton<BR>-AND JUSTICE FOR ALL (1988) Good metal, starting to conform a little but still a great overall metal album<BR>And finally -METALLICA &quot;BLACK&quot; ALBUM (1991) progressive in style but still hints of the roots of metallica. their last masterpiece, everything after this besides their garage days cd of the 2 disc set (Garage INC) ended what true metal was and ruined their rep as a True Metal band, the 5 first main albums and Garage inc is the only true Metallica collection the rest is worth denying.
B00018D44U|5.0|This is the best cd in my collection...she has an outstanding voice, that is pleasant to the ears and heart.<BR>     I own all of her's and am waiting for the next one..<BR> You've got to try this one. listen to all of it first.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd is a playful band and most of the songs are pretty hard to understand. The first time I heard this album I was shocked, so weird stuff. The second time I was already very pleased what I heard. The first track &quot;Breathe&quot; with an intro &quot;Speak to Me&quot; was very relaxing and there was good lyrics. The second track &quot;On the Run&quot; was a good instrumental song with good rhythm. &quot;Time&quot; starts with bells and is a great track through the time. Very good lyrics! Time is ticking and ticking... &quot;The Great Gig in the SKy&quot; is a great instrumental track where's a woman &quot;singing&quot; woooaaawooaaa. &quot;Money&quot; starts with cash sound. It is maybe the most famous track in this album. It is a very happy song! &quot;Us And Them&quot; is a very good track. The vocalist sings very beautifully. &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot; is a great instrumental song! &quot;Brain Damage&quot; is one of my favoutites too. There are great lyrics including &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. &quot;Eclipse&quot; is a short but so great a track. This is defintely Pink Floyd's best album and one of the best albums of all time!
B00005LPVF|5.0|Oh yeah this is the NWOBHM'S finest moment! I think this debut  of Diamond Head, that is Lightning To The Nations(1980), is the best NWOBHM album. Because this is much more better than any other NWOBHM classics that were released in 1980. It is absolutely better and more speedy than Iron Maiden's debut. It is much more deadly and satanic than Def Leppard's &quot;On Through The Night&quot;. Even if it is less satanic than Angel Witch's debut, I think it is more heavier and powerful NWOBHM classic than Angel Witch's. Diamond Head's music in &quot;Lightning to the nations&quot;, has also more progressive and doom sound than Saxon's classic NWOBHM album, &quot;Wheels Of Steel&quot;. Also I think Diamond Head was unique among other NWOBHM bands. Because as I have heard, a writer in a music magazine called SOUNDS, talked about Diamond Head's unique sound in &quot;Lightning to the Nations&quot;, and he said that Diamond Head is the only heavy metal band that puts more guitar riffs in a song than Black Sabbath did. If you listen this album carefully you'll see that this is true. Because there are too much riffs in songs that you cannot count,such as songs like &quot;Helpless&quot; and &quot;Sucking My Love&quot;. In original version of this album there are 7 songs. But I want to recommend you the extended version. Because in this version you will find other singles of Diamond Head which were released in their 1981 EP. called &quot;Diamond Lights&quot;. Please be careful when listening to this CD because you will find magnificent melodies in &quot;The Prince&quot;, some AC/DC influences on &quot;It's Electric&quot;, and really heavy and dark sound on &quot;Lighning ToThe Nations&quot; and &quot;Am I Evil?&quot;. Also in extended version there are such good songs like &quot;Play it loud&quot; and &quot;We won't be back&quot;. If you won't have this CD, you will miss some great music!! WHIPLASH!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd is a playful band and most of the songs are pretty hard to understand. The first time I heard this album I was shocked, so weird stuff. The second time I was already very pleased what I heard. The first track &quot;Breathe&quot; with an intro &quot;Speak to Me&quot; was very relaxing and there was good lyrics. The second track &quot;On the Run&quot; was a good instrumental song with good rhythm. &quot;Time&quot; starts with bells and is a great track through the time. Very good lyrics! Time is ticking and ticking... &quot;The Great Gig in the SKy&quot; is a great instrumental track where's a woman &quot;singing&quot; woooaaawooaaa. &quot;Money&quot; starts with cash sound. It is maybe the most famous track in this album. It is a very happy song! &quot;Us And Them&quot; is a very good track. The vocalist sings very beautifully. &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot; is a great instrumental song! &quot;Brain Damage&quot; is one of my favoutites too. There are great lyrics including &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. &quot;Eclipse&quot; is a short but so great a track. This is defintely Pink Floyd's best album and one of the best albums of all time!
076781326X|5.0|If only movies were made like this today. This film is filled with witty comedy, wonderful music, and great acting. One of the best musicals out there!! This film displays a boy's life going from the lowest of low (an orphanage) and slowely rising to a better life. The only thing is, it makes stealing look a little. .. well . . fun! But i'm sure we can all live with that right?
B00005V3Z4|5.0|(...)It is a fantastic film created by amazingly talented people.  Greg is probably into movies like Bambi and Land Before Time.  Donnie Darko is clearly a movie for open minded and MATURE people who are curious about all possibilities.  I hope in my lifetime I see more movies like Donnie Darko.  I own the DVD and the soundtrack and both are incredible.  I would suggest this film to anyone who likes movies like American Beauty and Vanilla Sky, movies that leave you with a good feeling and leave you to wonder about the world around you.
0140072187|5.0|I picked this book up at the library a number of years ago while I was reading various books about the Vietnam War.  It was a very good read and told the story pretty well.  I especially like the stuff about the training and grouping with other pilots.  I also liked the stuff about the emotions as they were going to war.<br />I remember seeing the first part of the trailer for &quot;We Were Soliders&quot; as the helicoptor pans across the screen and thinking that they were going to make a movie of this.  I wish that were true because I think this book would lend itself pretty well to being a movie.
0880796863|5.0|I think that anyone who's interested in modern, intuitive tarot (as opposed to traditional, historical tarot buffs who follow the Marseilles path) MUST own a copy of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, as it's the wellspring from which all the other modern decks have come.<br />This is my preferred version of the deck, too. The soft, subtle colouring appeals to me much more than some of the almost-flourescent newer versions. The colours in particular remind me that this was, graphically at least, a product of it's time - the Art Nouveau period.<br />It's taken a long time for Pamela Colman Smith to get the recognition she deserves. She might not have been the most skilled draftsperson there ever was, and this deck was made in a very brief period of time - but in my opinion, her power was in her subtlety. Slight nuances of expression, muted tones and patterns in the fabrics and fills. In this version of the RWS deck, I can almost feel the lightness of her touch as she painted these images.<br />I agree with others that if you're a beginner, Waite's original booklet isn't a great deal of use - get yourself a good, thorough book like Rachel Pollack's '78 Degrees of Wisdom' in addition.<br />I own a couple of RWS versions and I think that in this case it's true that &quot;the Original is still the best&quot;. I'm so glad this 'Original' reproduction set is available again.
B000002LND|2.0|ya i dont understand the reviews on here. say why YOU think its good rather than giving people stats on how many #1 hits Madonna has had or how many albums she's sold. truth be told, most people have heard all these songs so you dont really need to read reviews. fact: Madonna had some decent pop hits in the 80s. they're on this cd, tracks 1-9 are worth listening to. post 80s Madonna is no good. your best bet is to do like me and DL the hits off a site like Kazza and Ares and don't give your money to this grubbin ho.
1559409010|5.0|Who can fault a movie where the theme is to always look on the bright side of life?<br />The film parallels the story of Jesus but it takes us in another direction, to see a population who can't seem to think for themselves. They must have a Messiah to follow and they think they have found one in Brian. But Brian isn't interested in being their Messiah.<br />My favorite line is when a crowd calls for Brian to come to the window and show himself. His mother opens the window and tells the crowd: \\"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy.\\" The Monte Python ensemble has a knack for making us laugh at situations that when seen from their satirical point-of-view, are quite ludicrous.<br />The point of the film is our longing to belong and to follow a leader. Yes, if you look at it from that approach we are all sheep. We must flock and we must follow. We are all constantly searching for that Messiah to lead us. And yes, we see it in the modern world where good leadership is quite deficient. The crowds roar together, \\"Yes, we are individuals.\\" \\"Yes, we must think for ourselves.\\" But do we?<br />This film will offend some, but it is harmless fun and sometimes you have to trust having fun. After all, isn't this what Jesus' life was about, teaching how to get along and connect with other fellow human beings, as well as spiritual redemption? I'm sure Christ had a good sense of humor, as I know God does. Blessed are the fun makers.
0312995423|2.0|This is a marginally entertaining yarn if you can think of it as taking place in some sort of parallel universe, in which the history and principles of cryptograhy are very different from ours.  In our universe virtually all of what the author says about crypto is wrong.  He gets the Caesar cipher wrong.  He gets public-key crypto wrong. Terminology is garbled: a cipher has a &quot;key&quot;, not a &quot;pass-key&quot;. The story pivots around the sudden appearance of a seemingly unbreakable cipher, which throws the National Security Agency into a panic.  In our universe there has been a completely unbreakable cipher since 1917.  It's called a &quot;one-time pad&quot; (look it up).  It's more cumbersome than the more conventional cipher, so it's used only in special situations, but it is absolutely unbreakable.<br />There are too many coincidences.  The author sends a boy to do a man's job and then creates a deus ex machina to bail him out.<br />There is a political slant that argues that &quot;Big Brother is your friend, he keeps you safe&quot;.  Never mind the Fourth Amendment.<br />The author does do a good job of keeping motives hidden, so you are partly surprised who the heroes and villains are at the end. (But even one of the pure heroes trades jackets with an unsuspecting tourist, knowing that the assassin is looking for that jacket.)<br />If you have nothing better to read, this is sort of OK.  But don't buy it.
0880796863|5.0|this is the best deck i've dealt with, of the ones i have. as someone before said, it's really easy to do it without the book, but there is a little one with the deck for guidance. it is a great deck for beginners and up, so no one will have a problem with it. its illustrations are fine and don't deflect attention like some others do.
1400049628|5.0|I won't repeat what so many others have said so much more eloquently than I, but I will say this: For those of you who are trying to interest your offspring in such things as \\"How To Get Out Of The House If It's On Fire\\", or \\"Where To Go In An Emergency\\" this book provides a 'cover story' that will maintain their interest.<br />Kids may not be interested in learning how to get out the house if there's a fire, but they'll be interested if you say the plan is really for running from zombies instead.
0913866156|5.0|this deck is good. the cards are bigher than most and the symbols and stuff are easier to read. you don't have to 'look for' anything. its a good deck and you'll be able to understand it nicely. :)
B0000TAZTW|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. I just entered the 5.1 world of surround sound with mixed results. When a classic album like this is remixed, the results can be iffy at best. In this case, I'm a satisfied customer, listener, and fan. The SACD surround mix is tasteful and at times, exhilirating. Awash in Ry's slide, John's fine acoustic rhythms, Nick's rock solid bass lines, and Keltner's propulsive drumming, well, life can't get much better...sonically at least. Go out and buy it. You won't be sorry.
B0000C1733|5.0|When I heard the chili peppers were coming out with another greatest hits I wasn't sure what to think. I knew they had so many hit songs, and I was afraid they wouldn't put them all on. Even though I love this cd, they missed a lot of great songs that they should have put on.<BR>For example:<BR>1. Fire<BR>2. Knock Me Down<BR>3. Power of Equality<BR>4. Breaking the Girl<BR>5. I Could Have Lied<BR>6. Aeroplane<BR>7. Warped<BR>8. Around the World<BR>9. Easily<BR>10. Porcelain<BR>11. Savior<BR>12. Right on Time<BR>13. This is the Place<BR>14. Dosed<BR>15. The Zephyr Song<BR>16. Can't Stop<BR>17. I Could Die For You<BR>18. Midnight <BR>19. Tear<BR>20. Minor Thing <BR>21. Venice Queen<br />I realize these aren't all hit songs, but those are some of my favorite Chili Pepper's songs. I was a bit sad to see that none of those 21 songs were on the cd. However, a few of those songs were on the dvd that came with mine. In conclusion, I liked the cd a lot, but wish they would have added more songs.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My previous favorite TV show was Bablyon 5, the detailed story arc, the characterisation, the immagination behind it was awe inspiring.  However, it started off kinda lame, kinda slow and didn't solidly pick up until second season.  What sets Firefly ahead of B5 is that it starts off equal to the best that B5 ever did and kept the quality consistent, no &quot;TKO&quot;-type episodes in sight!<br />Firefly has an absolutely fantastic cast that you can tell work superbly together, wonderful story telling, lots of long-term plots to keep you interested, and one of the most original story lines to be brought to TV.<br />The only bad part was that FOX was paying the bills, which, coupled with the Timeslot Of Doom (8pm Friday nights) meant it wasn't going to stand a chance of being kept long term.  Luckily though a movie is being made by Universal for release during 2005, which will hopefully give it enough leverage to be picked up for another run at a TV show.<br />5/5, possibly the best DVD I've ever bought, up there with the Lord Of The Rings Special Editions.

B0001ADAVK|4.0|In 1953, Californian Modern Art enthusiast Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) gets a position teaching Art History at Wellesley College, one of the premiere upper-crusty women's colleges of the day, where the nation's brightest and most affluent young women received their education before marrying the nation's brightest and most affluent young men from nearby Harvard University. Katherine is at once taken aback by how sharp and motivated her students are and, in what seems to her a contradiction, how few ambitions they have beyond marrying and raising children. Katherine parts with the school's conventions in teaching modern art and in encouraging her students to harbor ambitions beyond the perfection of their homemaking skills.<br /><br />&#34;Mona Lisa Smile&#34; was written by Lawrence Konner  and Mark Rosenthal and directed by Mike Newell. I have to give the writers credit: By the end of this film, its large and well-drawn supporting cast and even follow-through to the very end of the story had me convinced that it must be based on a book. It's not based on a book. The novel of the same name, written by Deborah Chiel, was based on the film. This is just an extremely well-constructed screenplay that is unusually thorough in developing its supporting characters.<br /><br />This excellent supporting cast truly is &#34;Mona Lisa Smile&#34;'s greatest asset and the most compelling reason to see the film. This is a large cast that is universally terrific, so I'll just mention the best of the best: Marcia Gay Harden -one of our finest character actors- hits the nail on the head once again as Nancy, Wellesley's professor of poise. Kirsten Dunst does some of her best work as Betty, a student whose arrogant, vicious nature can't save her from the realities of her own imperfect marriage, although, ironically, imperfection might save Betty from her own nature. Juliet Stevenson makes an impression in a small role as the college's forward-thinking nurse, Amanda Armstrong. Maggie Gyllenhaal is Giselle, a radical student by Wellesley standards, noted for her many affairs with older men. Ginnifer Goodwin is a good-natured, bright, but chubby student named Connie, who thinks less of herself than others do. I won't go on -even though I don't want to short change any member of this cast- but a couple more recognizable names are Topher Grace, who plays the suitor of a &#34;Wellesley girl&#34;, and you can catch a glimpse of singer Tori Amos performing at Betty's wedding. I have yet to mention Julia Roberts. All I can say is that she is Julia Roberts, Movie Star, and this is a very suitable role for her.<br /><br />Lest you assume from the plot description that &#34;Mona Lisa Smile&#34; is a post-War feminist rant, I should say that this is not the case. Katherine believes that her students' minds will be wasted as ideal homemakers and corporate wives. Her students don't always agree. The film is about a group of diverse young women and one older one who, through their experiences of college's last semester, learn how they want to live. They all discover that they have more choices than they once believed. And then they make those choices according to their own priorities. Consider Your Options is about as preachy as the film gets.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a music video for &#34;Heart of Every Girl&#34; by Elton John, filmographies for the director, writers, and cast, and 3 featurettes: The film's cast comments on the role of art in their lives in &#34;Art Forum&#34;. &#34;College Then and Now&#34; is part making-of documentary and part discussion of the decisions faced by women graduating from college in 1953 versus present day. &#34;What Women Wanted: 1953&#34; is a documentary about some of the social realities of the post-War era, including interviews with the film's creators and cast. If you only want to watch one extra, try &#34;College Then and Now&#34;. &#34;Art Forum &#34; isn't worth your time. There are 2 unavoidablepreviews on the disc. Dubbing is available in French, Subtitles in English and in French.le in French, Subtitles in English and in French.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Titanic is my favorite movie! i REALLY want TITanic to come out on Special Edition DVD though!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Let's look at the facts. Jet is a band that is following the return of the classic rock genre. In doing so they re-use material from bands in the past. There has been a lot of worthless lambasting of these talented musicians because they're corporate &quot;canned rock&quot; and wannabes. The people that do this are the people that moved rock into the horrible state that it is today. All meaning and value has been taken from rock and horrible bands like Nickelback, Puddle of Mud (Creed copies) can make money because people have no idea what good music is. And some &quot;once good&quot; bands (Metallica anyone?) have even conformed to the style of today and have had massive losses in musical quality. <br />For those of you who think great bands of the 70s can do no wrong, a very high number of Led Zeppelin and Doors songs were  word for word almost note for note covers of Willie Dixon songs. Jet may have stolen some riffs, but they didn't take obscure songs and make them appear that they were their own. <br />Other than these few fallacies, there is no real case against Jet. They put on a great show, their music is helping create a revolution against every bad rock band today, and all people can do is complain. Buy the CD, find out for yourself. Don't listen to these heretics. If you had been a big Willie Dixon fan in the late 60s would you still have bought a Led Zeppelin or Doors LP? I'd hope so.
B0001611DI|5.0|George A. Romero's &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is legendary, a shocking, thrilling masterpiece of horror that continues to wow us over twenty years later.  The second in Romero's Zombie Trilogy (the first was &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;), the film is set immediately after NOTLD, and involves a group of four strangers who find themselves trapped in a shopping mall full of the living dead.  Romero knows how to make a horror film; his trilogy is arguably the greatest horror series ever made.  &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; isn't horridly scary - in fact, it's not very scary at all; it is, however, suspenseful, thrilling, exciting, absorbing, immensely entertaining, and - more than once - gross.  It has a very creepy feeling to it, and Romero makes us believe more than anyone else that this could really be happening.  There is also a classic score by Goblin (a.k.a. The Goblins) that helps add to the film's already horrific mood.  All in all, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is quite possibly the greatest horror film ever made, raising the bar to a level still not reached twenty-five years later.<br />DVD: There has been much complaint about this DVD.  While it is possible that it was rushed, it has excellent picture quality and some very nice special features.  I would highly recommend buying it.
0062502182|2.0|Big words (the Soul of the World, the Language of the World) coupled with alchemy and simple story create an impression of a book that an alternative religious sect would distribute. The language, a bit rough, as though cut out of wood, evokes primitive art. Simple truths (follow your heart, don't give up) sound like an Idiot's Guide to The Meaning of Life. This does not leave a reader starry-eyed.<br />One saving grace of the book is the story: it does flow and intrigue. It has adventure, fear, love, closeness of death. A few moments are quite poetic, such as when the boy feels the kiss on the lips of his beloved brought to him by the breeze, and thinks \\"It was the first time she had done that\\". And, of course, the treasure. The boy wants the treasure. And he does not stop when he has enough money to go back home and double his previous fortune. He does not stop after he has \\"50 golden pieces\\", he follows his heart and at last finds a chest full of gold and precious stones. Greed is good. He did not even stop when he found his true love. He was following his heart, which was not speaking to him of love, it was speaking of gold. And there's nothing wrong with gold, is there? This deserves a star.<br />Maybe the story really says: follow your heart and you'll get wisdom, love and money? This also deserves a star.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|I think it's a mistake the way some of the reviewers isolate individual factoids about what they see in the frame (empty cafes, a painter's knowledge of his own work....). They  seem to miss the overall - which is that it's a movie with a beginiing, an end, and something strange in the middle. These poor souls need to remember why they watch movies in the first place. Some works of art withstand repeated assaults - but very very few are invincible fortresses, and a bit of restraint and finesse is required or you're libel to ruin your enjoyment of a perfectly fine movie simply by throwing rocks at it. Why apply super assaultative techniques on the initial viewing? The amazing thing about great art is that it does seem to withstand initial analysis. I'm not saying Blow up is great art - only that the analysis part comes afterward, not as the frames are rolling out of the projector for your first viewing. How can you possibly enjoy watching a movie if you are intensely weighing it against 30+ years of hype, reviews, and memory?  And Resnais? And instead of guessing that a movie has a certain look because of budget why don't you give the director the benefit and ask if the movie looks a certain way BECAUSE HE WANTED IT TO LOOK THAT WAY? Blow up is hugely entertaining, and a fascinating examination of perception and reality - which may point to some of the other reviewer's questions. The painter's work looks strikingly like the blown up photos - which is obvious since this fact is delivered on a platter by one of the character's lines. You don't ask a painter what his work means; I learned this in art history. You ask a painter what he likes for dinner, what movies he enjoys. As soon as you ask him what his painting means, he's going to take you on a ride. So anyway, the point is, Blow up is well worth watching. It is beautifully shot, rewards with repeated viewings, and in that naive 60s way it rewards a gracious analysis with concepts and ideas that are neither pretentious nor flawed. It's a movie about SEEING. Watch it and enjoy.
B000002AHC|5.0|The Notorious Byrd Brothers marked a crucial turning point in the history of this band. Both David Crosby and Michael Clarke left the band at various points during the recording, forcing Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman to complete a few of the tracks as a duo. You would never know it by listening to this album, though. This is by far the most accomplished album the Byrds had made up to this point. Every song is carefully arranged, the studio effects are never out of place, and the adoption of baroque influences only serve to add color to the Byrds' already impressive palette.<br />I always thought Fifth Dimension was a masterpiece, and believe me, it is, but Notorious Byrd Brothers makes that album seem primitive in comparison. The employment of vocal phasing, horn sections, and Moog synthesizers is unlike anything the Byrds had done before. Of course, this wouldn't mean anything if they hadn't penned great songs to go along with it, but lo and behold, they do. It's just a shame that this album is so overlooked due to its failure to spawn any hit singles. \\"Goin' Back\\" has all the trademarks of a Byrds classic, perfect vocal harmonies, the jangly 12-string Rickenbacker, and the same wistful spirit that the Byrds had always been known for. In fact, it is very similar in structure and in feel to \\"Turn, Turn, Turn,\\" an earlier classic. \\"Goin' Back\\" is really the only thing on here that sounds like vintage Byrds; the rest of the tracks show the band trying to take their sound to new places. \\"Artificial Energy,\\" a song that deals with methamphetamine, kicks off with a horn section whose melody forms the basis for the song. Chris Hillman's \\"Natural Harmony\\" sounds like a forerunner for what would become the \\"baggy pants\\" Manchester sound in the early '90s. \\"Wasn't Born to Follow,\\" a key song from the Easy Rider soundtrack, has some country-ish window dressing, particularly in the guitar picking style. <br />Despite David Crosby's dismissal halfway through the recording sessions, he manages to turn in a few key moments here that remain some of his (and the Byrds') most poignant. Although performed mainly by McGuinn and Hillman, \\"Draft Morning\\" was originally Crosby's song. It deals with the dread a young soldier in Vietnam feels when he wakes up knowing he has to go kill some more \\"unknown faces.\\" You can almost sense the dread in his voice, as the middle of the song features the sounds of gunshots and explosions while a \\"patriotic\\" sounding bugle plays in the background. Kind of an ironic juxtaposition, really. \\"Tribal Gathering\\" and \\"Dolphin's Smile\\" are two of my favorite songs on this album. Here, we actually get to hear Crosby perform them. \\"Tribal Gathering\\" is very similar in sound and style to many of the songs on Fifth Dimension (also note McGuinn's John Coltrane-influenced guitar work), and the song itself has very much a jazz flavor. \\"Dolphin's Smile\\" simply has a great melody, and features lyrical imagery about the sea. The closing song, \\"Space Odyssey,\\" features a Moog synthesizer and lyrics inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's story \\"The Sentinel\\" (the basis for 2001: A Space Odyssey a few months later). The melody doesn't really go anywhere, but this song was about experimentation. <br />This album's bonus tracks are some of the best on the Columbia Byrds remasters, and these are not to be missed. The most notable here is Crosby's great \\"Triad,\\" a song about having a threesome, although it is sung in an innocent, hippie-ish way, so it never sounds sleazy at all. It fact, it's another one of Crosby's odes to the hippie lifestyle a la \\"What's Happening?\\" This is one of the highlights of this entire album. The instrumental \\"Bound to Fall\\" sounds like it too could have been lifted from the Fifth Dimension album. \\"Moog Raga\\" is also essential listening, as it features McGuinn trying to fuse Indian music with the futuristic sounds of the Moog. Also keep in mind that this was done four years before Pete Townshend fused synths with rock music. These outtakes reveal much insight into the making of such abreathtaking album. It's a shame that the Byrds would never be this boldly innovative again.
B00008OWZC|5.0|ok i wasnt going to post any review here but after reading a few others, i just had too. ok, people, just to get one thing straight, this is just an example of a live zep show from 72. lets not talk performance, which is astounding, but lets talk song lengths. no, they shouldnt have cut 20 minute songs down to make room for more songs. albums by bands worth hearing shouldnt be about &quot;how many songs&quot; or &quot;how much singing&quot;, but really it should eb about a performance. jimmy page found and remastered a &quot;performance&quot; for all of us that werent around, or even alive in 1972, to hear what zep was doing on that particular night(s). cutting or editing songs down in time would merely be a lie, and a tease, to what zep really sounded like. i would have even preferred that he not rearrange the songs for flow on cd, but hey, you take what you can get. and no, this should not have been 2 cds, because then we would have missed out on even more of what happened that night. this is a historical document, not nicely wrapped pop ditties for you to consume at an incredible price and then complain that the songs are &quot;too long&quot;. this is great. we should all rejoice! sure a 19 minute drum solo is a little long, but hey, thats what went down that nite, so thats what jimmy let us hear. so, im not bitter, i just love my zep and this is prime, prime stuff. roll something up, and enjoy it. then get the dvds and be even more astounded at the amazing albert hall footage!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Why is this album a guilty pleasure? Because it does sound like 70s rock, for the most part, but this isn't a bad thing. The songs are up-beat, rocking (#'s 1,2,3,5,8,9,11), chatchy tunes. When I first listened to Get Born it struck me as something I've listened to before, but I couldn't and still can't quite place where (maybe The Kinks?). I should mention that the ballads are good too, in fact I can listen to every song on the album without hitting skip, a rarity for any artist. <br />These guys aren't Led Zepplin, U2, or the Stones; they don't define a generation, or a genre. But they are good and worth a listen. I'd say this disc should be about your 100th purchase because there are better albums out there (e.g. Led Zepplin III, Sticky Fingers, Joshua Tree, Shake your money maker, etc), or if you want something more upbeat than Sigur Ros.<br />I suggest buying this album if you liked the samples on Amazon. Of course music, like beauty is subjective. I don't like The Stokes, Vines, Shins, white Strips, so you never know.
0345350499|5.0|This is a book on the legend of King Arthur seen through the eyes of the females who lived during that time.  Most of the story is told from the perspectives of Morgaine (morgan la fey), Gwenwhyfar (Guenivere, that's the welsh spelling), Viviane (the Lady of the Lake, and Igraine.  There are others, like Morgause and stuff.  But those are the most important.  The story starts when Morgaine was young and her mother Igraine was still married to the Duke of Cornwall, and the story goes from there to her and Uther's afair, Morgaine being sent to train as a preistess in Avalon, the rise of King Arthur, the incestuous night with Arthur and Morgaine which brings about his only son...which leads to many problems.  The love between Lancelet and Gwenhwyfar.  Camelot and the round table.  All of it is here.  And the story breathes new life into a lot of these.  Such as the proposal between Arthur, Lacelet, and Gwenhwyfar.<br />There is also a lot about religion in this book.  The constant battle between Christianity and the old pagan religion.  And at times, I would get really mad at these christian priests in the book who acted like *they* were higher than god himself.  I also enjoyed how the Druid Merlin was wiser about Chistianity than the priests and the prists would always resond with a &quot;The real interpretaions must be left to the priests&quot; and the like.  IT's ridiculous, especially since I know people like that for real.  <br />Anyways, if you want an exceptionally well written book about a classic legend, shown from a new perspective...pick this up.  This book now has a place in my number three spot of favourite books of all time.  Yes!
B000003N8R|5.0|Of all J. Coltrane's CDs in my collection (59-67), I find this recording most satisfying. Although not as furious as say a Love Supreme or Ascension, the emotional expression, technical genius, and the artistry of the Coltrane Quartet is still exposed to be easily assimilated by the listener. The multiphonic saxophone expressions on Crescent is amazing, the magnificence of Wise One and L's Lament is humbling, Drum thing stands majestic, and the swinging Bessie's Blues-awesome. Trane's horn sounds very full and warm on this CD, probably the best I have heard it since the J.Coltrane/ J Hartman CD. Enough said, just get this CD

B000002MU3|1.0|The star has fallen. This album is terrible. Particularly considering their musical history and their past potential for creativity and great song writing.  Do NOT buy this album.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|A boring movie about two boring people married to more boring spouses.  Whats up with Japan's nightlife?!  Couldn't finish this stinker!
B000002UVZ|5.0|Absolutely R.E.M.'s best album. If you were too young to experience it back in the day and wonder what all the R.E.M hype is all about, this album will provide the answers. Creative lyrics, melodies and countermelodies. Authentic. Earnest. Blows their later stuff (and most American music) away.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I think this movie deserved every bit of hype it received.  Last year's abundance of comic book movies and Matrix sequels really turned me off.   This movie brought together two characters with much in common though at different stages of their lives/marriages and avoided all unhappy marriage/lonely character clichés.  The beauty of this movie lies in what doesn't happen.    <br />Most people I know who didn't like this movie were expecting a Bill Murray \\"comedy\\".  It is, but not in the obvious ways.  It is so much more.  Murray and Scarlett Johansen were perfectly cast - I could not imagine any other actors playing these parts.
B00009RAJI|5.0|I was at the store practically the minute it opened to get the three three Fleetwood Mac re-issues (Fleetwood Mac, Rumours, and Tusk).  The second i got back out to my car i ripped the plastic off and started listening to the extra disc on Rumours and i was thrilled.  The roughs, outtakes, and demos are a dream come true for a major fan like myself!  There are two different versions of Gold Dust Woman on the bonus disc, and one of the versions is actually upbeat; totally different from the finished product.  Plus, many of Lindsey's songs are void of vocals so that you can really hear his guitar genius.  Never Going Back Again (one of my absolute favorites of the band) sounds just awesome and is further proof that Lindsey is a guitar GOD! There are also some demos of songs that didn't make it on the album, like Planets of the Universe (which actually made it onto Stevie's latest solo release), Doesn't Anything Last, Butter Cookie, and Think About It.  <BR>The booklet is also stunning.  There is an essay with tons of info and insight into the band's history.  There are also tons of pictures and even a two page collage of the band.  All of the lyrics are also included.  <BR>Buy this even if you already have the old copy of Rumours, the Bonus disc alone is MORE than worth the purchase price of the cd!
B00018TI5E|5.0|I bought this album knowing it was going to be amazing,and yes i was right,it is amazing. No point in going song song by song because they're all just beautiful. <BR> Fantastic melodies (carvel, omission), up tempo songs (water, this cold) are to name but a few.<BR> I cant rate this album high enough, john frusciante is a legend with the chili peppers without the chili peppers, hes just as awesome. SO just go and do yourself a favour and buy this sublime work of art.<br />was this review helpful to you, yes    no
B000002LQR|5.0|It's got somthing for every one.  Illistrtates the human condition in the universal language of true music.  This album is a part of me
B00005JMJ4|5.0|My Bloody Valentine is on the soundtrack. MBV is in a movie with Bill Murray. All the generic hipster boys and girls flocked to see this movie. The first time I saw it, I mean, I too was excited to listen to the splendor of MBV during a cinematic experience considering their videos were so, so-so.<br />Sofia's pretenciousness is obviously slandering other cute hipster girls with anti-horse talk, and &quot;every girl takes awkward pictures of her feet&quot; type of comments. She tries to come off cool to the scenester crowd, this movie is supposed to be about her and obviously she wants hipster credit.<br />It took me a few times of watching this movie to get over the above. This movie is just purely enjoyable, it's a relaxing foreign voyage. It's definitely more cute than it is funny. Lost in Translation is reminiscent of movies with heart of a classier time period when people really were more geniune in their roles, but it is only a day dream of that and whisps by like all songs on MBV's Loveless.
0385504209|4.0|This book was so interesting.  I learned a lot and it was a book you can really get into.  I have read all of Dan Brown's books because this one was so good.  A must-read for anyone.
