B007GCY8FS|5.0|I had heard mixed reviews on this book, but actually it was a great read. Although I had figured some parts of the plot out, I was still engrossed till the end, and enjoyed the &#34;Reacherisms&#34; throughout the story. Lee Child once again played off of Reachers great height and strength, which was very refreshing after trying to watch Tom Cruise as Reacher in film and making no connection.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Highly recommend. I haven't seen a puzzle game this beautiful and elegant since Myst, but this is even better because of the availability of hints.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|i would recommend this to anyone who likes old school rpg games like dragon quest or final fantasy.  ive spent many hours in the airport killing time on this game.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|The movie was entertaining and the cast was good; it was good to watch on an evening that I wanted to relax and be entertained, I have nothing bad to say about it, it has just been done
B001N4L38K|5.0|I already had this movie on DVD but I wanted it available for viewing on my Kindle since this is one of my favorite movies. If you like Greek Mythology you'll love this movie. Brad Pitts give the best performance ever of any film of this kind but lets not go to sleep on Eric Bana either who plays the role of s Prince Hector of Troy.  All in all this is a great movie with a great plot and a great cast - one of those movies you love to watch over and over and over and over!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Enjoyed learning much more about Tesla than I have ever known. Had he been funded to explore all that he imagined, the world would be a different place. Greed of investors and jealousy of other inventors interfered with his visions of making the world more illuminated. He was truly seeing the future. If his invention for the car had been adapted, we might have saved a vast amount of resources.  I admire Tesla' s tenacity and perseverance in the face of all of the opposition that he had.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very good, light hearted story about a couple who find each other in the most unconventional manner! Reels you in at the end!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I found this to be the almost perfect calculator for me. After using it for a couple of months, and still finding myself I reaching for other calculators , I decided to get the &quot;Pro&quot;. Sooooo this review will probably be continued over there.<br />But if you what a good basic model calc, that does th  standards things, plus memory functions AND one button percentages, this is the app for you! I especially like that feature when I have to figure State Sales Tax when I sell at Craft Faires and Farmers Markets.

B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|awesome  game, cant wait to get further and see what other characters await me.definitely looking foward to unlocking more armor.
B00BWU0S3Q|5.0|I think the characters were strong. Had a good plot. Good ending. Better actress for the lead role though. Good overall.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Must see!<br />Clean TV viewing for the whole family.<br />You can watch this in front of your adult parents and not have any uncomfortable moments.
1400063736|3.0|I was really excited about this book when I got it. It took me three tries to actually finish it unfortunately. It was woven together like short stories, which was interesting. But on the whole I found it really slow and it didn't grab my attention. There were moments where I thought maybe I was really going to be happy I read it, like a spark of great writing was shining through. But then I was back to sloshing through it. Not my cup of tea...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely LOVED it. So amazing <3<br />I can't wait until I read the next book!<br />I wish the story would be longer...
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Love Jamie Foxx,been waiting on this ever since it was at the movies,thanks amazon for help making movie night fun.

B0012CH350|5.0|I wasn't sure whether I wanted to buy a &#34;weber&#34; grill cover, or one from the local discount store.  Decided to get it, definitely worth it (cover is very sturdy material with good weather proofing).  will have cover for many years.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows on these days. There are so many different and interesting characters who are all well developed and well acted. Get Season 1 and then get Season 2!
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Great book!  I love Harry Bosch.  I could not put it down until I finished it but didn't want it to end.  Can not wait to start the next Harry Bosch novel.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Simply one of the classics of science fiction.<br />One of my earliest science fiction books that I ever read. Can not recommend this book enough to everyone.

B00BFPX132|5.0|Sodom are pioneers of Thrash metal. I've listened to them since the late 1980's, when they were not that popular. A lot of bands followed their steps, and its a shame that they are not as well received as Slayer, Anthrax, Metallica or Megadeth. Either way, this album does not disapoints at all. the riffs, drums or growling vocals will put chills on your spine when you crank up the volume. If you like thrash metal, this band should not be overlooked, especially this album.<br /><br />All Sodom's albums are awesome. As technology progressed through the years so did their sound. Their thrash-metalism culture never vanished but only progressed to more bone crushing, head banging metal aspiration.
0679805273|5.0|This book is a great book for inspiring children and adults for that matter.  It is a typical Dr. Seuss rhyming book with a great message.  Great pick me up and motivator.

I get notifications saying I have 5 lives but when I open the app they disappear. the game also freezes up at times.. also, only having 5 lives at a time unless you buy them kinds sucks. you can only play for 5 mins then wait 40 to play again.

B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I knew CH would break my heart with this book. I was prepared, I swear. But this... all of it...<br /><br />Read DUD (how appropriate!) and then DEA. You won't miss a thing.<br />Why read 12 books about a Southern gal breaking up with her suitors to get in the 13th book with the random guy? Why bother with all the fillers? That's right. All the nice words, all the angst, all the times Sookie had been one step away from dying? Why learn that you're better off to square one? That everything you've been through was for naught? That the idea that people from different races could find common interest and love against all odds is utter bulls***? That love is not what matters and that it's never enough? That after 12 books you realized that maybe reading the thoughts of your partner ins't that big a deal after all? That it's okay to end a character's story arc by selling him into slavery, but a little nicer- political marriage- after he'd been abused for *hundreds of years* in the past? And place the rapist as her friend and confidant?<br /><br />Well, don't bother. Just don't.<br /><br />I was reading the wrong story all along.<br /><br />I didn't really care who Sookie ended up with. That was not the important part of this series. Not really. But if she ends up with X or Y, give me a good reason to believe it, not a cluviel dor!<br />It's not the WHO that bothered me, but the WHY and the way it was done. At this point, I wish Eric and Pam had died in Rhodes. At least I would have gotten the chance to see Sookie falling in love with \\"the right man for her.\\"<br /><br />Why were all her choices for a suitor so bad, anyway? One is a rapist, another the author did her damnedest to show me in the last couple of books that is a selfish, practical, cold bastard (whom I still love, by the way), another is all about his mommy and little sister, another yet who's all about the pack and his ascension, and the lamest of them all, the bar owner. Right there in front of her nose for 13 books, her good friend and boss, who did nothing- NOTHING- not even once to show his interest in dating her. But of course it's okay to put them together in the 82% of the last book. NOT.<br /><br />The author intended to kill Bill in DAG but didn't because he had more story to tell. What was that story again, excuse me my curiosity? To bring Bubba to Fangtasia to distract Victor while they try to kill him? To rat Eric out to Sookie (with information we have no clue how he got a hold of), and lurk in her woods for all eternity? What an amazing story.<br />Harris said she knew how she would end the series by the second book. Too bad she didn't end it with the third. Right then, I would have believed Sam was the one all along. Maybe. But after 10 more books of hearing crickets where Sam is concerned, it was pulled right out of her ass.<br /><br />Arlene, Glassport, Tyrese, Amelia's father and Claude... so anticlimatic and utterly boring. And what the hell was that with A devil, not THE devil?! What the hell was the difference? No one told me in the end. Not that said devil was important to the story whatsoever to begin with.<br /><br />Sookie was way off in this book. She was not even True Blood Sookie. And believe me, that's saying something. Everyone was OOC. This was a horrible ending for many characters, just a massacre, but Sookie was a real disappointment. Because I thought that since the author messed up Eric's character, she, at least, would be fair to Sookie. No such luck. Never again, CH.

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This one was disappointing. Although I love hidden objects that seemed like that was pretty much 90% of the game. It was just okay.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Loved the first 4 songs...worth it just for that! I dont know why some people are complaining. The greatest guitar player has more great tones and guitar solos for me to hear! The guitar solo in Hear My Train Coming is my new favorite solo...such great tones and phrasings...masterful performance, I dont care how many times this song gets released as long as it has a performance like this one. This cd gave me another glimps into what Jimi was doing as the cd was meant to do. Izabella was good and I liked Mojo Man as well.

B00000JBFW|4.0|The comeback album by Deep Purple \\"Perfect Strangers\\", (1984), 9 years after they broke up with David Coverdale and Tommy Bolin.  This album gave us back the  Mark II line-up, their first since 1973's \\"Who Do We Think We Are\\".  Everyone sounds like they wanted to give every Deep Purple fan there best effort!  Ian Gillan sounds great here, he had just left Black Sabbath after his one album run with them \\"Born Again\\", in (1983).  Ian Paice and Jon Lord got out of Whitesnake and Roger Glover and Ritchie Blackmore expired Rainbow.  On this album their 11th studio offering, the band gave us, the 7 minute bruiser \\"Knocking On Your Backdoor\\", the prancing \\"Nobody's Home\\", great bass by Roger Glover.  \\"A Gypsy's Kiss\\", love Jon Lords organ break on this one, the ballad \\"Wasted Sunsets\\", Blackmore's guitar on \\"Hungry Daze\\", is special, the 10 minute \\"Son Of Alerik\\", is prime Purple and the title track which floats on like magic.  They would release their follow up \\"House Of Blue Light\\", in 1987.

B003XVYLDU|4.0|Let me start by saying that Slaughterhouse-Five is a good read.  Vonnegut is a great writer.  From the standpoint of reading pleasure, this book did not disappoint.  I find books like this bothersome, though.  Vonnegut uses the book to deliver heavy messages about war, life, and more.  And, yet, he does it in a story set in a fictional universe with big differences from the real world... where aliens show us that linear time is illusory.  If time as we know it weren't real, that might change conceptions of how to live life.  After reading the book, I found that I had to remind myself that the real universe is not that of Slaughterhouse-Five and that not all lessons from the book carry over into real life.<br /><br />I would recommend reading the book for an enjoyable and thought provoking read.  But, you just might conclude that parts of Vonnegut's message are nonsense.
B009NY43NY|1.0|There was nothing I enjoyed about this book. After a decade of waiting anxiously for each new installment in this quirky, charming and thoroughly engrossing fantasy world I feel nothing but disappointment. It felt very \\"off\\", rushed and unfamiliar.  These were not the characters I read and re-read over and over through the years. Who were these characters?  No quirk, no charm, no fantasy, no pulse quickening moments.  The overall theme seemed to be what the effects of various forms of magical \\"roofies\\" had on these once beloved characters. So very, very disappointed.  I will miss having these books to fall back on in the years to come whenever I need to start a re-read.  I won't ever be able to do that again.  Ending this book felt like leaving behind friends forever because they were so changed that I not only didn't recognize them but didn't want to be around them again. Ever.

0307887898|5.0|This book does a great job of teaching the principles of lean and applies them to startups and new ventures within existing businesses.  If you have been given a new project at work or you are working on a new business of your own this is an essential book for you.  I was already familiar with lean principles from my job as a Manufacturing Engineer but the way Reis puts the application of these principles into the context of any new undertaking gave me a new perspective and a renewed vigor to apply lean principles in all that I do.  Thank you for writing this book, I am sharing it with everyone at work and with friends.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I can't say I liked this book but I can't say I hated it either.  It was a little hard to get into and the language, although sumptuous, was a bit sticky in some of the tales.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|If you like movies thematically based around the mob, cops, or generally like action, then you'll probably find Gangster Squad to be an enjoyable experience. The premise involves a sanctioned but secret band of police officers who fight dirty to smash up a notorious and powerful gangster's seedy business. The whole adventure is actually inspired by a real life Gangster Squad whom you could guess probably were probably somewhat a little over exaggerated for this classic take on action feel. Also, this film is light on the drama, romance, and suspense but can be taken sincerely if you give it a chance.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the film and would watch it again, but I wouldn't count as a great movie. I'd really like to see everyone in this movie in more movies because I think they are all wonderfully skilled actors and actresses.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I installed this game and hoped that it would be fun, and it was. But after playing the game twice it stopped working. All the titles load and then it goes back to the home screen. Waste of 0.82 Gb of your kindle!
0062059963|5.0|To say this was a book I waited for eagerly would probably be an understatement. Given my location, which is in the middle of nowhere, I knew the stores I frequented would not carry it in stock and I knew it would take to long to arrive in the mail. I know, I know, I waited months for this book what is one or two more days, but it simply would not do.<br /><br />So as midnight rolls around I am waiting on the Amazon website to purchase the book for the kindle, only to find that it was not in the right time zone and I had to wait longer. It was a disappointing night and bed time lol.<br /><br />This book was an eye opener for me. Before in the first book I would have been Team Maxon all the way but just as if he were a real person it goes to show you that you never know what is really going on with someone until you really get to know them.<br /><br />I think my heart broke with America during each traumatic even that opened her eyes to what life would really be like if she chose him.<br /><br />It is hard to write this review because there is so much I want to talk about but I don't want to give anything away, I want you guys to read it and have to deal with the suspense and heart ache the same way I did, without a clue as to what would happen next.<br /><br />I will say the only thing that I wish could have been improved on is the other girls background. I understood before with so many girls it would have been impossible to do without having an incredibly long and side tracking book but as the choices are narrowed down I would love to know more about the other girls and what makes them tick, particularly Celeste.<br /><br />I also would love to understand the rebels more and trying to figure out what they are after and why is a delicious mystery that America seems to be tapping into.<br /><br />This is a great read, even if it was over before it seemed like it had begun. I finished it within four hours of sitting outside on the porch swing enjoying the day and getting sun burnt since time got away with me as I got lost in the work.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Unfiltered war stories, and the effects of military service on family and civilian life. All very human, told by a hero in his own words. Reading this and getting to the happy conclusion, only to know what tragically happened to Chris Kyle (and his family) after he left the service, is like an American Shakespeare

B002QGSW8I|5.0|This was the first book I ever read by James Rollins and I didn't quite know what to expect. I quickly found the book to a fast-paced thriller, both captivating and informative. Rollins covers a wide-range of political and scientific topics, all meticulously researched and presented in an exciting fashion. His references to the worldwide disappearance of bees, as well as the geo-politcal underbelly of seed production were absolutely fascinating. The characters Rollins creates are strangely intriguing, allowing the reader to stay interested in his world and wanting to come back for more.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|We were skeptical about how good the quality of the singing would be in the movie version of the musical.  I expected to be disappointed, since I had seen the live performance twice.  I didn't think the actors' voices would be up to par with a Broadway performance.  Hugh Jackman has an excellent voice, as does Anne Hathaway.  The movie was able to capture the intense hard labor performed by Jean Valjean in a way that the live performance never could.  The acting is excellent, and the music is hauntingly beautiful.  If you have a surround-sound system on your TV, you will especially enjoy this movie.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am hooked on F.B.I. Agent Pendergast, last remaining member but one (or maybe not) of an odd, slightly insane, New Orleans family. The Pendergast family is the epitome of dysfunctional, and Special Agent Pendergast can't escape his heritage. From his legal ward whose age is way past the century mark thanks to life-extending experiments of his great-uncle, but who looks like a young girl in her twenties, to a servant who is intensely loyal, but slightly odd, Pendergast is surrounded by intimate companions at the low end of normal. This long-running series also flirts with the paranormal, from a monster running loose in the basement of a famous New York museum, to mad scientists conducting evil experiments on an island in the middle of the Mississippi River.<br /><br />In the present story Pendergast is searching for his wife, who was kidnapped at the end of the previous novel. For years Pendergast believed his wife was dead. Now that he knows she is alive he wants an explanation for her supposed death, but first he must rescue her. With a plot involving neo-Nazis, betrayal, and interference by a well-meaning but misguided psychologist, Pendergast makes a stunning discovery which makes him question his wife's motives for her disappearance even more closely.<br /><br />The genius of this series lies in the ability of the authors to make even the most abnormal character and situation absolutely believable. The reader willingly suspends disbelief and accepts the world of Special Agent Pendergast as actually existing. The writing is rich in atmospheric overtones and totally compelling. Only readers lacking imagination and a sense of the absurd could possibly put this book down.

1617751588|5.0|Simon Tofield brings to the page all the fun from his online videos.  He manages to capture \\"cat thinking\\" and idiosyncracies, and render them in a heartfelt way so that even those that are 'meh' about cats can appreciate their antics.<br /><br />What I particularly love about his work is that I can find it humorous and occasionally thought provoking, and my kids --tween and newly minted teen-- can laugh at them too.<br /><br />Definitely recommend to cat aficionados.
B00797MB0O|1.0|I couldn't make it halfway through...horrible movie.charleze was never a fav but she embodies everything wrong with modern female relationship ideologies/delusions...if you wanna sit and watch something you have probably lived through with an ex or a stalkerish attention seeker or the wake they leave and no positive entertainment value whatsoever because unless you've been there then you'd know you don't want to entertain yourself with these these characters...I guess one star for the reality aspect.just don't see how this is comedy.or even a decent drama.now a Hancock thats what needs to be going down..that movie was tight.and the italian job sick flick.even aeon flux even though they tried to make a story out of it was good..she made a horrible script choice....and suprisingly I almost feel the same way with monster...don't get me wrong they captured it...but just cuz you can capture a turd and it's real would you ingest it purely based on that merit alone?for a mental sadist,or a self justifying sociopath this might be an excellent film..and who am I to judge what those things are and how you enjoy your brain.just thought I'd put a warning for the rest of us.wasted to much time on this review.
B00CJ7EK4E|4.0|Rod Stewart's first album of new material in nearly 20 years is here. Considering the raspy rocker recently released his memoir, Rod: The Autobiography, the album's title, Time, is appropriate. During his time, Stewart has sold hundreds of millions of albums, been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice and won a Grammy.<br /><br />Time is a solid effort by Stewart that every fan should check out. While it's not perfect, the majority of the album is very good. Below is my track-by-track review:<br /><br />\\"She Makes Me Happy\\"<br /><br />-With an infectious chorus and a joyous vocal, this sets the tone of what's to come. While it has a modern sound, the violins and mandolin give it that classic Stewart sound fans have come to love.<br /><br />\\"Can't Stop Me Now\\"<br /><br />-The shoe-stomping beat and visual lyrics of this song makes it similar to \\"Rhythm of My Heart.\\" Being that it's about Stewart's struggle to become a successful musician, it's an inspirational message that's sure to resonate with many people.<br /><br />\\"It's Over\\"<br /><br />-This is my favorite song on Time. I'm a sucker for ballads, and this is as good as it gets. The lyrics are about Stewart going through a divorce and the pain that came with it. His voice sounds great on this track and the chorus is haunting. This is one I could listen to again and again. It's that good.<br /><br />\\"Brighton Beach\\"<br /><br />-According to Stewart, this is the one that started it all; it made him realize he could still write a quality song. It's an extremely mellow, acoustic number with beautiful lyrics. It's very different from the previous songs but still a worthy addition to the album.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Morning\\"<br /><br />-Having bought Stewart's Christmas album, I was granted a free download of this song months ago. However, it's been remixed since then. Now it includes more guitar, additional drums, and the vocals have been adjusted a bit. Regardless of the changes, this song is fantastic. It's easily one of the happiest pieces of music I've ever heard.<br /><br />\\"Live The Life\\"<br /><br />-This is a nice, mid-tempo number that's perfectly suited for Stewart's voice. The chorus is simple, positive and enjoyable. And the song sounds as if it could have easily fit on one of his classic albums from the 1970s.<br /><br />\\"Finest Woman\\"<br /><br />-This song reminds me of \\"Hot Legs\\" with horns. It's sung with gusto, the subject matter is a woman and the lyrics are pretty straight forward. But unlike \\"Hot Legs,\\" it's not very good. It's easily the weakest song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Time\\"<br /><br />-\\"Time\\" is a soulful ballad featuring rich harmonies, solid guitar work and a great vocal by Stewart. This song gets the album back on track after the forgettable \\"Finest Woman.\\"<br /><br />\\"Picture In a Frame\\"<br /><br />-Any time Stewart covers Tom Waits, you're in for something special, and this song doesn't disappoint. It's a heartfelt, piano-driven song with gospel undertones. Simply beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Sexual Religion\\"<br /><br />-For fans of \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" and Rod Stewart's 1980s material, this song is for you. It's an up-tempo song that's begging to be remixed into a dance track. With a catchy hook, a pulsing beat and a sexy sax solo, it's one of the most memorable songs on the album and worth revisiting \\"over and over again.\\"<br /><br />\\"Make Love to Me Tonight\\"<br /><br />-Stewart has spoken a few times about wanting to record a country album and this song reflects that. Between the hand-clapping, fiddle and twangy vocal, I started to imagine Stewart singing the song in overalls on the porch of a farmhouse. But don't take this the wrong way, it's a wonderful song. And I think he'd do a terrific job with a country album. We'll just have to wait and see if it comes to fruition.<br /><br />\\"Pure Love\\"<br /><br />-This heartfelt, piano-laden number closes out the standard version of the album.

B00CDT41RY|1.0|Racist, unnecessarily violent and predictable.  There is no entertainment value to this movie.  There is no theme, message or sense to it.  It is just blatant and extreme violence wrapped in a Western clothing.  It's not event entertaining, just very, very predictable.

B009NY43NY|1.0|After following regiliously sookie stackhouse's novels since book 2to  13 books(!)<br /> I must say I feel  betrayed after the events of the book series.<br />All those books may had a point for sookie and what she considered fair and well.<br />It turns out all the character growth was for nothing.And some characters traits has been erased her witty,loyal ...apparently came from her low sel-esteem that seemed to  have no aspirations in life but mate after all with seals...<br />I feel charlainne's writing has become dull when she was with the last 2 books.The other ones  for comercial reasons had exciting moments .this one  was certainly not!<br />Honestly if you want to remember the character growth as individual stop at book<br />9..<br />That's the happy place.<br />To sumup I'm dissapointed with the storylines the pointless plot points .<br />It's a lazy book or lazy writing .<br />p.s :DON'T BOTHER BUYING IT...
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I first heard The Piano Guys on youtube. And I can't remember just what lead me to them, but since about all I listen to these days is Bocelli and some classical, it had to be a jump from those videos. And I strongly think it was  Mozart because the first Piano Guys cover I heard was &#34;Michael Meets Mozart&#34; and then I had to hear everything they had done. This cd is great and I never get tired of playing it. Just pre-ordered their second cd/dvd and can't wait to get my hands on it. If you enjoy awesome piano and cello playing check out their youtube videos and their channel. You won't be disappointed.

If you are a parent it will leave you wondering what you would do if you were in the parent's shoes. Each character has their own distinct personalities that the author has managed to make a real connection with the reader.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Thirteen books and this is the ending that we get?I will not address anything specific so anyone who hasn't read it can do so without knowing what happens.I will however say that this whole book felt like Ms.Harris phoned it in.I can't believe that this was honestly the ending that she has had in mind for eight or so books.I can't imagine any true fans of the series being satisfied.About half way through the book I could see where it was going and actually said out loud that I would be happy with ANY other ending besides where It was going.Shame on Ms.Harris for forgetting that the fans of her books are the people who made her so successful.Another reviewer summed it up perfectly.She seems to care much less about her characters than the readers do.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I can understand why people would be upset that their wished pairing didn't go through but it is what she wrote!<br /><br />It certainly felt like and very obvious that Ms. Harris has lost touch her love for Sookieverse. The story overall feel flat. This story's problem/obstacle seems mediocre compared to the first few books. The last chapter wrap up seems a little abrupt similar to the Harper Connelly endings. The writing style was 'meh'.<br /><br />Even though I didn't get the happy ending that I wanted, it's nice that the series has finally ended and she attempted to bring back an all star cast of characters for the wrap up.
0345803485|1.0|Ok, so what do I say about this book? Let's leave the fact that it is mean to everything and everybody, it puts them all in stereotypes, it praises an abusive relationship with no chemistry as 'love for the ages' and all that.<br /><br />If you somehow managed to overlook all that, how can you possibly overlook the atrocious, cheesy writing, filled with unneeded descriptions and words and words to fill the pages, with no purpose.<br /><br />The characters are also especially unlikable. (Again, if you somehow manage to overlook the fact that Christian is and abuser and borderline wife-beater) he is still obnoxiously pretentious, a total d-bag and a horrible, horrible Dom who provides his sub with nothing from the Sane, Safe, Consensual motto.<br /><br />Ana on the other hand somehow manages to be the stupidest bimbo out there who is somehow both full of herself and down on herself. She is atrociously implausible character, with no common sense whatsoever, and no knowledge of how anything in the world works. Not to mention she is just annoying, with her constant whining over nothing.<br /><br />The other characters don't even deserve mentioning because they are so little developed and treated more like devices than actual people. And they are usually very inconsistent. Oh, except Ana's Inner Goddess (a clumsy representation of Freud's id) and her subconscious (which is actually her conscience). I fib not, these are actually characters - they have faces and everything<br /><br />Another thing I despise in this book is that there is no plot, and even when the plot is trying to fight its way trough, the characters just keep ignoring it. And the books just insist on having a traditional over-the-top silly villain, instead of I don't know like... real-people conflict.<br /><br />And last but not least, everyone's favorite topic: the sex. It is repetitive, it gets tedious after a while and for all that talk about erotica, it reads more like an DYI manual that something to get aroused by. And most of the time it's really pretty tame.
0385349947|5.0|Lean In by Sandberg was a fantastic read. She manages to share her personal leadership struggles while maintaining a worldly perspective. Far from being a feminist book that exclusively addresses upper middle class or highly educated women, Sandberg offers a vision of more equal leadership that offers men and women of any background more opportunities to pursue their passions -whether in the home or in their career. I really enjoyed her argument that the myth of \\"having it all\\" has been twisted into women needing to \\"do it all.\\" Far from shooting down the big dreams of men and women that want fulfillment in both their personal and professional lives, Sandberg argues that having more women at the top will enable us to actually have the successful family and career many desire through proactive policies designed to not create an artificial choice between work and life.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that Sandberg justifies herself a bit too much and works too hard to connect her vision to everyone. Given the unfair media attention she has grande simply for being a successful, hardworking woman this proves to be completely understandable and even logical.
034580404X|1.0|The 50 shades trilogy consists of poorly written books with no plot; flat, one-dimensional characters (especially the main ones), who despite having slightly more personality than baked potatoes, still manage to be deliciously obnoxious. They are as follows - Christian Grey the sociopathic, douchy wife-beater and Ana Steele the stupid, whiny, annoying and overall despicable human being. It's also boring as hell, because it insists on telling us every single unimportant detail in great length, while sometimes skims over important ones. It also chooses all the uninteresting situations and conflicts, while running from every possible charcter development and variety .<br /><br />It's not enough 50 Shades manages to ruin its genre so thoroughly by using all the wrong clichés (including, but not only: Kink is bad and Love curse); these books also glorify abusive relationships and enforce every single thing wrong with the Western society, which is as follows: racism, xenophobia, homophobia, tokenism, hairism, misogyny, the rape culture etc.<br /><br />And the worst thing of it all is that women everywhere force themselves not to see all those problems, just so they can enjoy cheesy dialogue and the  bland repetitive sex scenes, that seem to read more like an Ikea  manual than erotic literature; and call it `romance'.  In reality these two characters have no real chemistry and don't love each other.Instead, they want is to possess each other, believing that that will solve an emotional or self-esteem issue for them. Quite frankly, I am not entirely certain they even like each other - Ana doesn't seem fond of Christian's personality at all, and he spent all of his time, trying to change her to be who he wants her to be.<br /><br />And last but not least, let's not forget the origin of this feast of garbage -a Twilight fanfiction. Leave alone the fact that all the characters and therefore character-interaction are a total rip-off, but from TWILIGHT? At least Meyer managed to rip-off better books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely love these books! In my . Up opinion, this book is better than the first one. Can't wait to read the final one.
193700788X|1.0|SPOILERS!<br /><br />I think we all know now why Harris won't be touring to promote this book, because honestly, is ANYONE besides Harris herself happy with this book?  Very few I would wager.  Even Sam's pathetically small fan-base can't be terribly excited about Harris's poor execution of the HEA.<br /><br />I think one other reviewer summed it up best when she noted: \\"It's too bad Harris didn't care as much about her characters as her fans did.\\"  As many others have noted, the writing had declined over the past few books, but I had held out hope that Harris would put out her best efforts into the final volume, the conclusion to Sookie's beloved and long-running saga.  Alas.<br /><br />It took 14-15 years and 13 books to have Sookie come full-circle, albeit bearing considerable physical and emotional scarring from her adventures?  Is Sookie any better off now than she was in the beginning?  No, definitely she is worse off.  She's settled for second-best in her love life and hasn't expanded her life circle much at all.  I can appreciate that someone like Sookie prefers the simple things in life, but at the same time, the supes opened up her world to so many more exciting possibilities than had ever existed for her previously (and she says as much, notably to Sam, in the 8th or 9th book).  At the end of her journey of self-discovery, she's in the same place, having rejected what all along has been painted as something that energized and completed Sookie.<br /><br />I strongly favored Eric-Sookie, but I could have been happier with the actual resolution if Harris had painted Sam as a convincing alternative all along.  While the reader has sensed throughout the series that Sam had interest in Sookie, she has never thought of him as anything other than boss and friend.  I also think it's unfortunate that Harris opted to have Sookie TELL the reader about her friendship and bonds with Sam far more often than she SHOWED it in the previous 12 books.<br /><br />All of Harris's writing energy went into the larger-than-life character and fan favorite, Eric.  And, in the end, she thumbed her nose at the vast majority of her fans and gave Eric a terrible ending, truly assassinating his character in a way I would never have dreamed possible.  If Harris and I were having iced tea around the kitchen table, I'm sure she would tell me that Eric is HER character and that she was entitled to do what she wanted with him and that she understood him best, being his creator.  But, I would counter that once a character is shared with others, that character belongs to us all, and thousands of fans (at least 75% of the Sookie fans were Eric/Sookie fans in poll after poll) can't be all wrong.  Harris leaves most of her characters in a reasonably happy spot in the end (though I would quibble whether Sookie herself falls into that category).  But Eric?  Sold into sex slavery for 200 years, forbidden to have any contact with Sookie and exacting jealous vengeance by trying to thwart Sookie and Sam before that ever got underway so that Sookie can't even have fond memories of him?  Really?  That's the best you could do for the most beloved character you're ever going to create, Ms. Harris?  That's your response to the years of devoted readership and loyal following from so many fans?  Even if you truly did always intend Sam to be the HEA (and had to insert numerous deux ex machina and create inconsistencies galore and ignore completely much of what's been written in the last 8 or 9 books to get there), why would you leave Eric himself in such a terrible situation?  You couldn't get creative and come up with a scenario wherein Eric and Sookie come to some heartfelt recognition that their differences were too great to overcome and have them part on good terms?  Eric was the one who \\"got\\" Sookie - they shared the same sense of humor and the same exuberance for life, as Bill and others had pointed out and noted.  Their relationship had taken books of gradual andsustained build-up.  To have it end in such an out-of-character way was sloppy, small-minded and unfair in the extreme.  It showed no respect whatsoever for the bulk of your fan-base, and I have no respect for you as an author as a result.<br /><br />The adage \\"readers like to be fooled but not deceived or conned or cheated\\" applies to you too, Ms. Harris.  It was not a clever \\"aha!\\" twist to suddenly shoehorn Sam into the HEA.  It required a good bit of cheating to get there, and doing so at the expense of the best character you're likely to ever create and his legions of fans was certainly not honorable or worthy of you.

B005S9EKCW|2.0|The concept of telling this story through singing alone does not work. It reduces the story to a series of set pieces, and the great singers made the good singers sound weak.  The narrative has no continuity, and the end result is a lot of visual beauty and not much else.  I saw this on Broadway, and it's still the best way to see it.

A tight plot, unforgettable characters, and prose that is effective in evoking a time and place all combine to make this one of the best stories I've read in quite a long time.  Johnson also manages to portray the human condition in all its facets at every step along the way.  I can't praise this novel enough, so I'll just say that, if you are excited by the idea of reading a masterful piece of literary fiction, this is what you want to get ahold of next.  It's truly a work of art.

I will reread  this book many times as there are inspirational ideas to be used in everyday. I enjoyed learning about Tesla who I now realize was a very important person, in so many ways, not just because of his inventions but because of his passion and humanity. The book was well written and I hung on to every word.  Would be a great short book to read in a group and discuss.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The misremembered man is a series of contrasts.  A cold and hard orphanage versus a loving and kind adoptive family.  The despair of solitude in contrast with the enduring hope that things will get better.  Ms. McKenna does a wonderful job of balancing the light and the darkness of the world.  The main characters are endearing and completely lovable.  I also found the characters of the neighbors folksy but in a good way.  I wanted these characters to be my neighbors.  Triumph over tragedy. Ms. McKenna captures the heart of the rural Irish and her book has captured my heart as well!
B009NY43NY|5.0|For thirteen books, Sookie's life has been turned upside down, inside out, and stretched as thin as possible without actually killing her -- though many of those around her haven't survived.  The supernatural community, of which she is a member, has thrown her for a loop more times than she can count.  Some of these obstacles can be overcome; others can't.<br /><br />In Dead Ever After, Sookie faces those realities.  She sizes them up with what she wants out of her own life, and she digs deep inside herself and the people surrounding her.  And in the end, her decisions aren't rash or hasty.  The conclusions she makes have been building over several books, and anyone who has paid attention really shouldn't be that surprised.<br /><br />She ties up loose ends, successfully throws in unexpected surprises, and adds blurbs of third person writing that kept me on my toes.  It was sad to say goodbye to these characters that I've gotten to know over the years, but she did it justice while still taking us on one last rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />SPOILERS (and soapbox) AHEAD:<br /><br />As a staunch Eric fan, I was more than a little disappointed.  But just because I love everyone's favorite Viking doesn't mean that I have any say in the way Ms. Harris chose to conclude her series.  She didn't owe me anything.  She owed the series the ending that followed the course she had laid out for it.  And albeit very reluctantly, if I really look at it, Sookie and Eric's compatibility only went so far.  Eric wanted to turn her; she didn't want that life.  She wanted children; he couldn't give that to her.  The fact that they misinterpreted the use of the cluviel dor as a betrayal by the other just shows that they weren't on the same wavelength.<br /><br />If I have one beef to the ending, it would be that Eric is somewhat doomed to misery, even if it's of his own making, for the next two hundred years as Freyda's consort since Pam and Karin aren't allowed to accompany him.  It seemed to be added salt to the wound, but again, as I'm not the author, it's not my call to make.  The book was well-written, so I won't call my personal plot preferences into play when handing out stars for a review.<br /><br />As long as I've followed the series, the tv show, and other works by Ms. Harris, she has always provided a sense of reality to relationships between her characters in the worlds that she has created (as much reality as can be had in urban fantasy, anyway).  She acknowledges the toll that pain, betrayal, and salvation have on relationships, and she emphasizes their evolution and devolution.  Many authors either ignore this or never master it.<br /><br />So while I, along with a large portion of the female population, mourn for our beloved Mr. Northman, I will first and foremost always be Team Charlaine.  The author gets to call the shots, not the fans.  I'm very much looking forward to After Dead to see how everyone has fared since the series conclusion.to be added salt to the wound, but again, as I'm not the author, it's not my call to make.

B009NY43NY|2.0|After reading the last few books, this ended pretty much like I expected.  *SPOILERS*<br /><br />I think to the series readers it was getting pretty evident that she was writing Eric's character in a way that was not the one we all fell in love with.  I also think it was pretty apparent that they wouldn't get their HEA like we wanted.  I also think we were starting to get the feeling she would end up with Sam.  I personally didn't want that to happen, it seemed rushed and the Sookie we knew and loved wasn't really in this book.  She was just going through the motions and the story was pretty blah.  Pam wasn't her fun self.  This new child of Eric's wasn't really anything exciting and Eric and Bill's characters were just ridiculous at this point.  Sad ending to the series but I can't say I am surprised.

But foer does a better job inspiring change, giving reasonable rationale for his dietary choices.  One has to wonder if it was an easier decision for him being Jewish and growing up knowing what kosher means.  I think that's the cog in the vegan movement machine - modeling ethical behavior for the next generation.  If your kids see you do it, see your ease at doing it, hear your reasons for doing it, they are more informed and therefore can accept it easier.  It will not be an irrational behavior.<br />Well done.

B00AO7HQ06|4.0|You're a Duane Allman fan.  Something about that guy's playing just got to you.  You still go back and listen to Live at the Fillmore and marvel.  And now, you've got this decision to make.  Do I shell out over one hundred of my hard-earned dollars for this box?  OK, I like the guy's work, I really do, but do I really need/want this?  Well, all I can do is give you the facts as I see them.  This is not a Bear Family quality box, neither in the actual physical contents or the sound quality.  The mastering is OK on some cuts, above average on some cuts, and very disappointing on some cuts (for instance, the Clarence Carter cuts are very much poorer than my vinyl counterparts).  The remastering is never superlative.  The thing that is superlative about this set is the scope.  If you really love this man's playing, here is where you will find the definitive overview of his recording career, from beginning to end. I don't claim to know what it may miss (that's not the Allman Brothers), but I'm guessing it has most of the session work that he did.  And because he worked at Fame studio and with Atlantic artists, the actual material he played on was, for the most part, excellent in every way.  So you not only get to hear him play, you get a great sense of where American music was between 1968 and 1971, through the lense of Atlantic records and Fame studios, and THAT is a mighty fine lense.  If he were to be judged just by his session work, the legacy would still be one of excellent music, all the way through.  This box, though overly expensive and ordinary in sound and overall production, proves that.

B0014BY72Q|2.0|For years, I have been told this is a must-see sci-fi movie.  I finally watched this on Amazon Instant Video yesterday.  I will  never be able to get those two hours back.  This is a classic example of a really cool concept stuck in a bad movie.  I expected poor special effects due to the era but the acting and dialogue is laughable. This movie fits in the category of awesomely bad.
B002BI6SMI|1.0|I could not get the movie to play.  I have played other videos from Amazon and never had this problem. :(

1878424319|5.0|This is the best book ever and everyone should have one!  It changed my whole life ... I have learned that by loving myself first I have the capacity to cherish and love others in no matter what circumstance that I am in....in general we are all human...I learned that God loves me and made me for a reason.... in the same way he made others the way that they are for a reason! This is a great gift for anyone dealing with emotional pain and who may need a little boost of advice to help them cope with life's struggles and or any emotional and mental distress! Don Miguel helped me to rethink about my purpose in life... and to me that is to find meaning in everything that I do and to have positive relationships with others!!!!!
B001ANSSDC|1.0|strange and unlikable characters. slogged through this because I heard the movie was so great, but I really can't see how they made this into a movie... they must have changed a lot.
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|A very well written and complete story with a few unimportant questions not answered in the end, mainly I suspect due to the cancelling after only two seasons.<br /><br />The story and characters are well done, and the actors do a very decent job of delivering with what I can image was a very difficult part, especially when each character can be so drastically changed every episode as part of the story.<br /><br />There was some overacting/underacting, unnecessary drama at some points, and some corny scenes, but good-to-bad ratio was always more towards the good side and kept me watching.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Excellent character development, and the story has twists and turns.  I loved the Zen lessons for all of us Time Beings.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I've always enjoyed this series. Not every book has been great, but they entertained me...until this last one. I've never been more disappointed in a book or the way a series ended. I wish I had never read this last book and just imagined the ending I would have( and I'm sure a lot of other fans of the book will agree)liked.
B003MC5N28|3.0|I can't say that I loved it, but it was good.  I had wanted more to the ending(it was a lot shorter of a book that I usually read), but I don't think I'll go ahead and read the series.  I don't see how this isn't an appropriate book for middle school, might give the kids today something to think and appreciate.
193700788X|5.0|I've never seen anything like this before, but the book/movie \\"Misery\\" has really come to life and is happening before our eyes.  There's a rabid and deranged (and very vocal) cohort of Eric-loving \\"superfans\\" of Charlaine Harris who have now decided to hate her and \\"destroy her\\" because her Sookie Stackhouse series ended in a way they don't like...and that didn't follow their fantasies of Eric.<br /><br />This is exactly what happened in Misery to fictional writer Paul Sheldon, with deranged Annie Wilkes (played by Kathy Bates in the movie) attacking Sheldon (James Caan) because he killed-off the fictional character \\"Misery Chastain\\" and didn't end that series of books the way the \\"superfans\\" wanted.<br /><br />It's weird to see history happening right in front of us...but some day people are really going to study what's happening to Charlaine Harris right now.  It's the first time I've seen supposed superfans rabidly turn against a writer because she did not give them their fantasy ending to a book series.  It reminds me of the Kurt Vonnegut quote about people dressing up in full-battle armor to fight an ice cream sundae (how he described crazed readers who take umbrage with what happens in a work of fiction).<br /><br />The thing is, though, that the people who are so angry just deliberately ignored the fact that the ending they wanted was just not ever going to come.  They were really fixated on a love affair between Sookie and Eric...but Sookie and Eric were never meant to be any more than Buffy and Angel were \\"meant to be\\" on that old TV show.  Sookie ends up with a different man...and the \\"superfans\\" are throwing a massive tantrum today.<br /><br />I think we've really crossed a line in terms of how unhinged the Internet makes some people.  It's kind of scary to read the nasty things people are writing about Harris here on Amazon...and the threats being made against her.  It almost reminds me of the jihad declared on Salman Rushdie when he wrote The Satanic Verses.  Eric-Lovers have declared a jihad on author Charlaine Harris and it's a sad and scary thing to see.<br /><br />To \\"destroy her\\" they are voting this book 1-star.  It's a very organized effort.  They've been planning it for some time. \\"Yah, this how we'll get her!\\" they say. The funny thing is, though they're vocal there really aren't too many of these people.  Compare this manufactured backlash against Harris to what happened to the game publisher EA after the latest SimCity game crashed upon release in March (as of this posting, there are 400-something \\"1 star votes\\" for this book but 2,500 \\"1 star votes\\" against SimCity...which is something that actually deserved a solid 1 star rating).<br /><br />This latest book by Harris is very much like all the other ones that came before it and featured Sookie Stackhouse. If you like those, you'll like this.  It has all the same charming things that I love about the Sookie books.  There's all the local color and charm that describes life in small town rural Louisiana.  A lot of favorite characters from the past briefly flit in and out or are on the periphery...which is nice since it's the last book in the series (so if you liked some of these oddballs, you get to see them one last time in cameo).  To me it kind of felt like the last week of high school where you try to see as many people as you can just one more time before you all graduate and move on with your lives.<br /><br />I like that this book is being used to setup the next Charlaine Harris series that debuts in 2014.  That one will be about a crossroads where there's a demon and some kind of pawn shop.  So in this book, at least one of those characters from the future books appears.  To me, this was a nice touch since it was sad to see Sookie go but I like that the Sookie universe will continue in a new series.  I even hear that Sookie will appear in the new series, just to get it started. As this book closes I look forward what is going to be happening inthis new town in West Texas now that we are leaving Bon Temps.<br /><br />The last thing I will say is that you should ask yourself a question before you read this new Sookie book:  are you a fan of the series because you love Eric and you wanted to be with him in real life?  If so, then maybe you should never read this book and you should just write a fan fiction ending to the Sookie storyline for yourself.  If you are like me and you liked the Sookie books more for the mysteries and the supernatural adventures, then this book is enjoyable.  I personally was not into the series for the romance...but liked the supernatural mysteries more.<br /><br />I also never felt Sookie would ever want to be a vampire and that she didn't much like being involved in all the crazy vampire politics.  She is a simple girl who enjoys living in Bon Temps, working in a bar, sitting in the sun, visiting with friends, and thinking about having babies.  If you really know Sookie as a character from the previous books you'd see that she ultimately could not end up with a vamp and that she needs a guy she can spend her days with in the sun.  That seems really obvious to me...but the people upset right now are the ones who wanted her to become a vampire and/or spend her life up all night being involved in the vampire politics she always hated.this new town in West Texas now that we are leaving Bon Temps.<br /><br />The last thing I will say is that you should ask yourself a question before you read this new Sookie book:  are you a fan of the series because you love Eric and you wanted to be with him in real life?

0385344228|5.0|I had been looking for a book that was this good for a long time. OMG. It was suspenseful, but the family realness, the complexes of family differences and general views pull you right in. The ending was a surprise ending which is also true to life. Loved it and reccommend it so much. Not all things and events in life are true and crystal clear, and our own souls digest different life with various views, things are not always what they seem. LOVE IT!!!
B007RCJNDE|4.0|A good fast finish to the series, unfortunately I had lost all emotional attachment to any of the key characters due to the earlier drawn out books, but an overall pleasant read.<br /><br />I felt there were a few questions left unanswered in the end which made my inquisitive mind all the more annoyed at not knowing why some things happened the way they did in this book.

B00B1E6FF8|4.0|In a way Kathryn Bigelow's \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a very ambitious movie, probably more ambitious than her previous \\"The Hurt Locker\\" in that her new thriller deals with a more recent event: death of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />For some (or most) potential viewers, \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" will not be what they expect. If you are looking for a more dramatic and action-packed fact-based thriller, you may find Bigelow's slow-paced narrative style frustrating. Sometimes there are so many details going on, that though each sequence is absorbing, the 157-film film itself feels too long and uneven.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain plays Maya, the film's protagonist about whom we know nothing about, except that she is determined to track down Osama bin Laden. Chastain's strong acting effectively shows us the change her character must undergo over the course of the investigation, though the reason for her determination, or obsession, is not explained.<br /><br />Some reviewers compare the semi-documentary approach of \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" to that of \\"Zodiac,\\" a David Fincher film made in 2007. In both, we audiences know where the film is going. We expect the process of revealing the truth to be concise and clear (possibly with a character we can identify with), while the film gives only detailed accounts of events, which mat look real but feel drawn-out.<br /><br />Though I prefer a more accessible approach with a faster narrative and characters with back stories, I found \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" to be a rewarding experience, even though I admit I had to be very patient at times trying to follow the narrative thread.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Being a person of the theatre, I am always impressed by excellent acting, in an age when acting, cerebral story lines, and well-developed characters are being deemphasized on television, cinema, and even in theatre.  Downton Abbey is a refreshing return to those high standards, and the resulting productions are extremely real.
1592332803|5.0|I appreciate that this cookbook explains the purpose of eggs and dairy in non-vegan baked goods and how easy it can be to replace them.  i.e. eggs are used as binding...  Most people wouldn't dream of being able to make chocolate chip cookies without eggs or some might think they'd taste like \\"health food\\".  But these don't! and because of her tips I've been able to impress lots of my non-vegan friends and shown them just how normal and decadent vegan baking can be.  I also got weak-at-the-knees at the taste of the caramel popcorn!
193700788X|1.0|Issues abound in this book: out of character issues, pacing issues, and continuity issues, not to mention others. I will describe some of them in more detail below, for anyone who wants to be that well informed about my opinion. Before I do I will say that I think there are two issues that make this book bad that might help potential readers make a decision about purchasing. First, this series was supposed to end about ten books before this installment, and Harris has apparently kept the ending she had planned all those years ago despite the fact that everything that's happened during the ten books in the middle make that ending unsatisfying, if not completely unreasonable. As a result, DEA reads as if Harris was checking off a long list of things she had written earlier that need to either quickly be explained away or ignored in order to force the ending she had originally planned to actually make even a bit of sense.<br /><br />Second, I think it is extremely clear from the attitudes Sookie/the narrator force feeds readers that what Harris thinks she wrote in earlier books is not at all what most readers saw on the page. It seems like regarding many themes and specific characters Harris's vision inside her mind did not translate well onto the page, and that will make loyal fans of the series constantly go \\"What?\\" when Harris tries to say a final word about those things in this book. This is the inspiration for my review title.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />OOC: All of the characters say things that completely go against things they've said or done before, and Sookie constantly thinks things that don't line up with her previous thoughts and decisions from earlier books. In fact, I found myself wondering exactly who this Sookie is supposed to be, because not only are her thoughts and attitudes different, but even her speech patterns are different (i.e. cursing a lot). Harris seems determined to gut Eric's characterization and make him seem like he's always been a manipulative jerk more akin to how Bill in the True Blood show accuses True Blood Eric of being. Eric says things that contradict things he had said earlier, and Sookie goes from having certain attitudes and feelings towards Eric to doing a complete 180, even on specific issues she had already settled in her mind during previous books. She does the same towards Bill and Sam.<br /><br />Pacing: The book felt dead or wooden in the beginning, while the ending felt rushed enough to win the Indy 500. There are a lot of pointless filler scenes (i.e. cooking, shopping), but at the same time hours or days will go by that readers really needed to actually see, only to have Sookie summarize them. After things start wrapping up towards the end of the book, the speed goes from 0 to 100 in 4 seconds.<br /><br />Continuity: Harris uses all sorts of illogical or deceptive tactics to circumvent ideas or themes she had introduced earlier in the series which no longer meshed with how she wanted the series to end. Fans with good memories will find themselves constantly asking, \\"But didn't you say such-and-such in Book 1/5/9 that contradicts what you're trying to get me to believe now?\\" (i.e. Harris suddenly claims that Sookie can't read specific thoughts from shifter or weres, despite numerous examples of her doing so in previous books). Perhaps the most egregious problem for me is the fact that in order to gut one relationship and somehow set up another during the eleventh hour, Sookie suddenly turns into a bigot worse than many of the characters we saw first responding to Bill in Book 1, which is discontinuous with the thematic elements against prejudice that had happened in earlier books. Fans will also find themselves left with many questions about why exactly Sookie is supposed to be out of danger given what happens regarding her protector, among other general plot issues, and what answers we do get are largely unsatisfactory.
0547258305|5.0|I walked into a bookstore one day with a few books in mind, Graceling not being one of them. I picked the book up and read the description for it and thought, I'll give this a try. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I loved this book! I was immediately drawn to Katsa because I related to her character well. I love reading about strong, intimidating female characters. I loved the idea of some children possessing Graces and I wish that I was Graced with some incredible skill! I liked all of the characters, Katsa of course being my favorite, but I also really like Bitterblue. It was nice seeing her progress and growth in the book and I think her name is really cool. This book went above and beyond what I thought it would be and I will definitely be going further into this series and deeper into this incredible place that Kristin Cashore has created!

B00AIBZM40|4.0|The first time I watched \\"Mama,\\" I walked away disappointed. For some reason, the special effects looked extremely artificial to me. That was my only real complaint, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />As I was getting ready to write my review, I had this nagging feeling I needed to watch \\"Mama\\" again. Rarely do I watch a movie twice in such a short period of time, but I was drawn to give it another chance. I can't begin to tell you how glad I am that I did.<br /><br />Two little girls stumble upon a cabin after a car wreck. Five years after their disappearance, they're found and taken into custody by their uncle Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel. The two bring the children into their home and attempt to give them a normal life. As bizarre circumstances unfold, Annabel starts to get the feeling something sinister has accompanied the girls and is \\"protecting\\" them.<br /><br />For the most part, director / writer Andr&eacute;s Muschietti adheres to the saying \\"less is more.\\" We get quick and creepy glimpses of the supernatural entity. As the movie moves along, we are given longer and greater detailed glances at her. What looked very CGI the first time I took it in proved to be more convincing and practical at second look.<br /><br />I found \\"Mama\\" full of great moments of genuine thrills and chills upon giving it a second chance. You'd think a horror movie you've seen before wouldn't hold as much tension when watching it again, but that's not the case with \\"Mama.\\" It had more of an effect on me the second time around.<br /><br />Every actor in the movie is convincing in their role. Jessica Chastain transforms from a 1960s blond southern belle into a black-haired punk rocker incredibly well. The girls are absolutely phenomenal and their authentic reactions to the events occurring to them are noteworthy.<br /><br />The audio and video for \\"Mama\\" will please consumers. A lot of the film is obviously in the dark. This doesn't hinder the viewer from seeing everything they're supposed to. The picture is clean and clear although it has a bleak color palette splashed with autumn tones every once in a while. The 5.1 surround sound will have you jumping out of your seat at every bang, sudden musical burst, and groan seeping out of the speakers.<br /><br />There's a good amount of bonus material provided for the Blu-ray release of \\"Mama.\\" Director / Co-writer Andr&eacute;s Muschietti and Producer / Co-writer Barbara Muschietti contribute feature commentary.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Wow, this song is amazing!!! I decided to listen because I'm a huge disco fan and of Chic in particular, so once I heard that the legendary Nile Rodgers plays the guitar on this song, I just had to listen. This song has cracked the top 10 in many countries and is the most played song on Spotify with good reason. Daft Punk is amazingly talented and this song really captures the long-lost sound of disco and the good vibes that it brings. I'm hoping that the song's popularity will not only make the album a smash but that it will also usher in the return of disco, which should've never disappeared from the music landscape in the first place.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|I am a Bourne fanatic.  I have watched the first three multiple times.  When this one was slated to come out I was un-interested and paid no attention to it.  Without Matt Damon I thought it was just trying to scrape-up any last $ that might be available.  After months of the movie being out and ignoring it - and bored with anything else I could find - I gave the movie a try on XBox Movies - rented it in SD.<br /><br />I was shocked with the movie.  It was a great story, very interesting and believable and the acting was great.  At first I couldn't believe it might be better than the previous 3 - even though that's how I felt.  After reflection and watching it two more times - I truly like it the best - hands down.  There is not any wasted time or scenes in the movie - its never slow.  Jerremy Renner and Rachel Weiss (sp?)are outstanding.  The rest of the cast was outstanding too.  There's an edge to Renner - and a 'not so perfect' attitude that made it very appealing to me.  Weiss complemented Renner perfectly - she was not too weak or too strong.<br /><br />Anyway - for what one-man's opinion is worth - I truly loved the movie.  I just hope they use Renner again.
147674355X|5.0|I read this book based on a friend recommendation and she did not steer me wrong! I LOVED IT!<br />1. The plot. It has everything you could want in it and more. From secrets to lies, this plot will have you at the edge of your seat...literary!<br />2.  No insta-love. Yup, that's right. You get a story of two characters with a past that has been hidden from them. You get to explore every part of their relationship as they come to the conclusion of love and friendship.<br />3. Back Round history. The back round history of characters is what makes this story. The past is harsh and has so much drama in it you can't help but loose yourself in the story cause of it. The moment that little bomb of what really happens will make you loose you head.<br />4.  It's addicting  From the start of the story, as the reader you began to question motives and actions. Like,\\"Why is he mad?\\" \\"What's he hiding?\\" And you can't help but keep reading cause you NEED TO KNOW.  Once in the story, you are compelled to finish.<br />5. The ending. GAH! The ending is so amazingly good that you are in awe that you just read the book. I couldn't believe that it finished and when I was done I wanted nothing more but to re-read it again.<br />Hopeless is a glorious, amazing book that will leave you stunned! The clever world building colliding with lies is exhilarating. Blindsided by a jaw-dropping plot, Hopeless is spectacular!

0062059963|4.0|When I first read The Selection way back when, I remember thinking (and stating in my review) that it was the kind of book I could re-read many times. So, I happily did a re-read of the title when I received The Elite for review. Which meant I headed into The Elite with everything fresh in my mind, reading the duo of books back-to-back in a handful of days, and it just made the reading experience so much more ... oomphy.<br /><br />Because I loved The Elite just as much as I did The Selection. I loved where it took off from. Loved the twists and turns. Loved the revelations. The battles. The slow drip-feed of information that the reader should be suspicious about and trying to analyse, but they don't because they don't realise they should have been until we're hit with those `WTH/OMG/Please, God, no' moments.<br /><br />As I said in my review of The Selection, I kinda predicted how it would all play out. That wasn't the case for me with The Elite. Yes, we had the whole does she-doesn't she want Maxon. The whole does he-doesn't he truly want her. Or does she-doesn't she want Aspen. And dude, YES it became confusing as heck. YES it became as frustrating as heck. But I have a horrible of habit of slipping pretty deeply into an MC's role, assuming the author has done the job I expect of them, and so what they feel, I feel--and America was no exception to that. And if how I felt was anything to go by? No wonder the poor girl didn't know whether she was coming or going.<br /><br />Because I spent the entire book mad at Maxon, then loving Maxon, then mad at America for being confused, then mad at Maxon, then loving Maxon, then mad at America again--which all led to me feeling totally confused about the `other dude'. Though I do believe my mind is mostly made up by the end. Which is good--because judging by that ending, I predict (here I go again) America will have a whole other level of conflict to deal with in the third book, and I'm looking forward to (immensely) the change of scenery where that's concerned. Whilst the conflict I mentioned arrives with a horrifying realisation for the reader (though I had suspected Maxon didn't have as much control as is publicly portrayed--just not to this level), I loved this added depth, because I believe we needed something this powerful for the reader to forgive Maxon for everything that has had America in turmoil.<br /><br />As you can probably tell from my review, my thoughts about this are still pretty random and waffly, and I suspect that's because I'm still sitting here thinking about it, evaluating it, musing over it, wondering what's really going to be thrown at us next--to the point I haven't even started my next book, because I knew I'd need to try and work out my review for this one before I can move on. So before I begin to make absolutely no sense whatsoever, I'll try and wrap up with a tight and slightly more cohesive conclusion.<br /><br />Did I love The Elite as much as The Selection?<br /><br />Heck, yes.<br /><br />Did I like where the story was taken in this addition?<br /><br />Well, it wasn't really taken massively further than the last book. But all of those little bits of additional pieces, those side stories that help mould the characters and bring colour from the background onto the forefront, and help the reader to fall in love with all the right people ... those are what helps make this story great and help to set it apart and give it the strength to stand in its own right from the first book. There are quite a few of those. And they're all very impactful. Plus ... THANK GOODNESS they've both quit beating about the bush and finally begun to be honest with one another.<br /><br />Do I intend to read on?<br /><br />Dude! Wild horses couldn't keep me away. I NEED to know how America's going to deal with this new conflict, and how she will now fight for what she's realised she wants. I just hope I don't have my love-triangle emotions tugged all over the shop again--because those nearly drove me insane in this one with not being able to make up MY mind (never mind America's).<br /><br />And finally, would I recommend?<br /><br />O_O Why are we even having this conversation? *sigh* Maxon *sigh* Go and read these books. Now.<br /><br />That is all.

B00ABGEFWC|4.0|it's simple enough for a younger child to play but will hold the attention of an older child. bright graphics and cute animals.
B004XE0TDW|3.0|At this point, if you're looking at this page, you probably already know who Bon Iver are. The music is great and I was extremely excited to get this album on vinyl, as it seems to be the sort of \\"sound\\" that's well suited for the analog warmth of the format.  Honestly, if you've heard this album on another format (streaming, CD, etc) skip the vinyl. I had high hopes, but directly out of the sleeve the record had a multitude of cracks and pops, along with a generally poor sound quality. The \\"quiet\\" moments on the album are ruined by surface noise, which detracts from the overall experience from this album. A quick google search reveals that many people have had this problem, and that it seems to be a problem with the pressing in general.<br /><br />So, great music, crappy vinyl. The art looks cool in big format though, and it comes packaged with a lyrics booklet written in what's assumedly Justin Vernon's handwriting.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|nice graphics. easy to play. you do have to use gems to get some of the main character ponies from the show (not a small amount either), but still a fun game to play.
B003Y5USG4|3.0|I first saw this movie when it came out on VHS in the mid 1990s (I was 10 at the time) and I initially loved it. It was one of many reasons I went to college for meteorology. But after going to college, I fully realized how factually wrong the movie really is. Not that you have to be a scientist or a genius to see some of the flaws (i.e. inconsistencies with when the red truck takes damage in certain places and then several scenes later that damage is magically erased). But from a meteorological perspective, there are so many errors it's hard for me to enjoy the movie today without noticing them. A good example is how they would give a tornado a rating on the Fujita Scale before any damage was caused or how the actors can survive being engulfed by a mile or so wide tornado and only come out with a few scratches.<br /><br />Still, it put me in the direction I am heading today and I don't look at it as an abomination. Because of how it further \\"glorified\\" weather to me at a young age I can't completely bad-mouth the movie. It does have some good qualities: a fairly interesting love story, what drive the characters to put themselves in danger, some comic relief, and pretty astounding special effects for the era that the movie was created in. If anything it pushes me to further understand the meteorology behind severe weather. Why does weather not work the way that Hollywood portrays it? What are the precursors to this more violent side of weather? It may have a lot of things wrong with it, but it still promotes a lot of thought. Besides, it did really well in the box office so it wasn't a total flop. I give it 3 stars out of 5.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|As a college student, I rarely make time to read novels, or any books that weren't written by professors. I'm glad I made time for this book, though, because of how it draws on familiar emotions and fears to make thought-provoking connections. I recommend this read for anyone looking for a break in the monotony of life, as it draws you into a different world and forces you to ask difficult questions and learn what your opinions are about truth, life, and love.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|What is...is mental illness, and what should never be...is mental illness: This theme is represented through the very relatable story of an American family living in Philadelphia, PA. Patrick (Bradley Cooper) is leaving the hospital, after 8 months as an inpatient.  This is where he received his diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder and is going home to confront more than his fair share of life's major issues.  Ill-equipped emotionally, although now knowing the reason why his life has been in disarray, he takes the bull by the horns with a positive attitude and goes mining for a silver lining.<br /><br />The interactions of friends and family, including his father (Robert De Niro) and mother (Jacki Weaver), embraces all the successes and mishaps which make this story feel so relatable.  They all convincingly display the boundaries crossed, inappropriate behavior and controversial thinking present from time to time with Bipolar Disorder.  Patrick becomes extremely frustrated with the ending of Ernest Hemingway's, &#34;A Farewell To Arms&#34; and in a hair-trigger response pitches the book through his bedroom window.  This scenario is very relative to the anger, which sometimes simmers right under the surface and is very difficult to control.  His agitation (or bipolar anger) is quite understandable considering the state of his marriage and is as much present in the negative situations as in the positive; it walks hand-in-hand with the illness.<br /><br />Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is living with many intense issues of her own upon meeting Patrick.  Their introduction is splendid and humorously filled with the mix-ups that become unique to them.  Moving forward, they form a camaraderie through comparing medications, pointing out where the other is &#34;inappropriate&#34;, jogging on the same route, dancing lessons, and an airtight relationship that leads to love.  Their relationship is impressively acted and shows the 'normalcy' that the situation can and does become.  Patrick's friend Danny (Chris Tucker) who he meets in the hospital turns in a smaller role which adds much life and laughs to the movie.<br /><br />The soundtrack (Danny Elfman) brings a standout masterpiece in itself to the characters.  A deft placement of purpose filled songs is overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time.  The vocals of Jack White (The White Stripes) are itchy and chaotic throughout. These are as ominous as the bombast of Led Zeppelin's fracturing song (&#34;What Is and What Should Never Be&#34;) featured during Patrick's bipolar episode at his parents home.  I found the music in this as important as another character to this movie's relevance.<br /><br />Director David O. Russell is meticulous with the screenplay and uniquely personal with his own son contributing a spot-on performance in a bit-part.  &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34; (written by Matthew Quick during his own depression and subsequent pursuit to move forward) is a resiliently accurate portrayal of mental illness and family dynamics. A very comedic, painful but insightful look into Bipolar Disorder in its everyday life and a definite don't miss kind of movie.ck's friend Danny (Chris Tucker) who he meets in the hospital turns in a smaller role which adds much life and laughs to the movie.<br /><br />The soundtrack (Danny Elfman) brings a standout masterpiece in itself to the characters.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool has been one of those series that I have not been able to put down! Its backed my reading list up quite a bit! But I want more I want more of Jules and Lukas and more of the Silo's!!! Give me more Wool Mr.Howey!!!
B005PK1G76|5.0|As another reviewer mentioned, this fits our city mini and the cost was a major factor, at $6, it was a steal and comes in handy for walking around outside in the sun in Hawaii.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Unlike many of the reviewers, I was not a big fan of Ken Follett before reading the first of the Century Trilogy. I really enjoyed the first book of the series, and was really looking forward to starting this book when I finished the last digital page of the book. I did not want to pay $19.99 for the kindle version, but I was sure it would be worth it; it was not worth $19.99, but it was not a terrible book. Like most historical fiction the reader needs to suspend his or her belief a lot. It seems unreal that these people would all be conncected throughout many of these real events, and well... it is unreal, it is a work of fiction, so don't let that pull you too far out of what is good about the book. There are some really interesting things in book. The first book contained some moments of high drama, but you knew that all of the main characters were going to make it through. This book ratchets up the drama by killing off some of the main characters. The deaths of some of the characters came as a shock to me, but ultimately the book suffers when these characters are killed off. The new characters in this book are so one-dimensional the reader does not develop any feelings for them. The Dewars still have a little bit of charm, and the Von Ulrich's maid Ada has an interesting arc, but many of the characters are so stereotyped and flat that they just blend together. This book should be commended for being pretty progressive. There are a number of characters that seem progressive. There are some homosexual characters, strong female characters, and interracial relationships, but again, these progressive groups/characters are pretty easy to dismiss because they all fall victim to what has to be the worst descriptions of love and sex ever written. Reading about a characters tongue parting the lips and exploring the others mouth happens so often that it had gotten to the point of being groan worthy, then laughable, and then just annoying. If parsed out there are probably30 complete pages with the same description of people kissing. It happens so often that I began to question just who this book is aimed at. It might be exciting to an adolescent boy, but the &#34;sex scenes&#34; really ruin the narrative. Thankfully as numerous as they may be, the scenes are fairly short(usually a paragraph/half page at most), so they are easy to get through.<br /><br />My overall impression of the book was pretty negative, but there are some positive things in the book, I did enjoy following Billy Williams while he fought in the Spanish Civil War, and his escape as a prisoner of war. I did enjoy the look in at London during the bombings, and the scenes of the rally against facism. I did think that some of the atomic bomb stuff was interesting as well.<br /><br />This book has not totally shattered my confidence in the third book, but I am not looking forward it that one as much as I was this one.<br /><br />I would strongly suggest getting this book used or from a library. It is not worth $19.99, but it is worth a read(if you have the time).
630587493X|5.0|This is a favorite film of mine, mostly because it stays fairly true to Asimov's story. Robin Williams and Sam Neill are a particularly effective pairing and Embeth Davidtz is entrancing as Little Miss and her own granddaughter. &#34;Then You Look At Me&#34; is even a decent song.<br />So why isn't this on BluRay? It grossed $100 million, and is a lot better than most so-called Sci-fi films that are in the format, so why hasn't it been converted? I haven't bought the DVD just because I'm waiting for that version. Granted it isn't an action-packed, phaser-filled blockbuster. But it is a thoughtful (oh, hell, is that the problem?) enjoyable, well-acted film about SF concepts.<br />Come on! Put it on BluRay! I'll buy it!<br />Addendum two years later:<br />This is an excellent movie. It didn't follow Asimov's story exactly, but it<br />went in the same direction. The actors were superb and affecting in<br />their roles. Robin, Embeth and Sam (to be familiar and brief) nailed<br />their parts and had me believing in their characters. Oliver Platt was<br />also excellent as the robot/android scientist. It's one of my favorite<br />movies however... Two regrets: 1- This movie is STILL not on BluRay! AI<br />finally came out in that format, but if you want to see this movie in<br />hi def you have to stream it. 2- The soundtrack has James Horner's<br />background music and beautiful &#34;You Look at Me&#34; w/ Celine Dion but hot<br />the other popular songs covered by other artists. They were done<br />beautifully as well and should have been included. I don't understand<br />the problem with studios not catering to the likes of audiences instead<br />of their own legal and profit-driven short-sighted interests. They'd<br />make more profits if they aligned their products with the public's<br />likes instead of their own statistics or industrial expectations.<br />Nevertheless, this is a great movie and one of Robin Williams' best.<br />It's also true SF, not SciFi, whichis monster and space battle driven.<br />SF is idea driven.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I only searched out this book because of all the talk of the series. I mean, I couldn't go online, look in a magazine, listen to the radio without hearing talk of &#34;A Game of Thrones.&#34; So I bought the first book, and was immediately taken with it after only a few pages. After 800 more, I'm still speechless. I can't wait to get started with the next ones then watch the series. Truly an epic fantasy masterpiece.
B00B23O96A|4.0|Another all time favorite of mine. Sometimes I have to listen to music over time to enjoy it more and more with familiarity.

193700788X|1.0|I really loved this series at the start, so much so with every new release I reread the past books to keep it fresh.  The last two were bad, this one was the worse.  I won't even go into the ending, if you do decide to read it, get it from the library.  It's the writing style which was odoriferous.<br /><br />The first few chapters felt like they were throw away pieces the author drew together just to have some sort of plot line.  It was like she was wildly grasping at straws to try to weave her way to the ending.<br /><br />The political implications of this series was one of the reasons I enjoyed it, which allowed me to put up with the whining bratty woe es me Sookie (my god the woman is surrounded by those who have loved her and proven over and over and all she thinks about is she only has Jason? Selfish bwench)  But ever since Eric and Sookie killed his maker it's like the vampire politics (which drew Sookie into everything in the first place) is just a shadow in the background. So much opportunity for the author.  But obviously she was in a rush to 'wrap things up'.<br /><br />Even the ending, which ever way it ended up, was wishy washy.  The author struggled to shove every living cast of characters into one book for a few one liners, even Hunter got an honorable mention.  Sookie took a backward giant leap in this story, she didn't fight for anything, instead, everyone else did it for her.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I work with cops. Because of where I work, I look for more 'lighter' or comical shows to escape to because I watch enough of real life on 12+hour shifts. I'm also somewhat of a geek/nerd and absolutely LOVED Firefly!! So, as a Nathan Fillion fan, I watched a couple of episodes and I got hooked into the relationship development between Castle and Det. Beckett. And for me, this show hits every like button - Nathan Fillion, cop show, books (Fillion is a book writer in this show).
B0000025BL|5.0|Yeah, I grew up listening to this album.  It has lost NONE of it's rock opera charm.  Broadway never dies, so the over-the-top sentimentality and ruthless joie de vivre of the various cuts still shines.  Imagine a fine wine growing finer with age.  Now imagine that wine as an ice-cold case of Schlitz and a fresh pack of neon condoms.  That's Meatloaf.  Bon appetit.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Took forever to load, and played intermittently or however you spell it. i'm just frustrated right now. Think this one over.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Ok, she likes the action too.  Especially when Chris Hemsworth takes off his shirt.  Paid for the movie right there, for her.  It's not a stellar move (though it IS interstellar); however, it's a fun ride, and a decent addition to your Marvel movie shelf.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Interesting, flawed assassin meets 14 year old in need of help.  Baldacci creates wonderful lead characters, terrific action and surprises.  A couple predictable moments but can't wait to start reading The Hit.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|AHHHHHHHHHHHH MINE! I LOVE IT! wish it can with a tiny screwdriver to get the batteries in but i did it. :D
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a good book  had fun reading it  I would recommend to friend  it is lame I am forced to do a review though
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This app is cool. All of its features are easily accessible and very cool looking. I especially like the fine-tune settings. The alarm clock is my favourite.
B00AA0U05A|3.0|While I appreciate Ms. Rossum's efforts, I only like some of the songs.  The old standards were great, and I loved her interpretations of many of them.  But then she has songs I didn't think should have been included in this album.  But when she's good, she's powerful!
B005LAII80|4.0|I like it, I didn't love it.  It has lots of actions and good acting, but it just wasnt for me.  I say if the price is write go ahead and buy it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this app so much. it is so much fun to be iron man and all the suits. fun. but it is kinda like timple run. but.  this is worth it.  down load it.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|This was a great investment.  I can watch it over and over.  The actors do a wonderful job in this movie.  It is a bit long but enjoyable at the same time.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|I think I'd get along with Quentin - he loves the same corny Ennio Moricone type music that my husband and I do.  Some GREAT tracks on this.  Just love it.
B006UKC566|4.0|I love the action in this movie and the animation but it is not for the eyes of young children because it is very bloody and has lots of slow motion blood scenes
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I have to be honest and say that i didn't hear very good reviews on this movie. But, because I am a movie fanatic i must always see for myself. First off, I am a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence and that was exciting in itself. The movie was hilarious, witty, charming, crazy, confusing and in all good ways. Robert Dinero oddly made me cry of course. The overall story was amazing. Love does not always come like in fairy tales and this movie proves that. Sometimes the pain can bring two people together, and sometimes the people we need the most are right in front of us, even if we cannot see it right away. All i can say its suprizing-ly entertaining and you will not regret watching it. I suggest you watch this when you arent distracted by noise because everything that they say ,,,trust me you want to hear! I bought it the next day. GREAT movie!
B0057R5G6E|4.0|THis is nice.  I only wish the torches on the front entrance would have lite up when you push a button or something like that.<br />Like the &#34;Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One - Avengers Assembled set&#34;.<br /><br />The Movie is supper cool.  With a good sound system this will have you on your feet.
B00BJS7104|5.0|wow wow wow!!!!! Thanks to Quentin we got to experience another amazing film that is absolutely memorable. Must i even go into details? NO! you have to see it I WILL NOT give it away if you have not already seen this film. Just trust me you will LOVE IT!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book was amazing. I had no idea what is was about but I saw that a movie was made about it. I took the plunge and read it. I even had my mom read it and we both loved it. It has an intricate plot line and amazing sensory details. GREAT READ!
B001GQSY5K|5.0|Very clear and great CG graphics. I would recommend this to any Star Wars fan, especially those that enjoy the Clone Wars series
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was awsome full of emotion had me yelling and talking to the book as if it were a person! The writer has you truly connected.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Fabulous Collection of Diana Krall music....  not much more to say... She's amazing and so is this CD. One of my favorites.
B0000039QA|5.0|One of the best albums of all time. I cant believe on how fast it come to my house. I would order another cd very soon. No problems with item at all.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Great album. I was bumpin' JT's album for a while, but this is far more interesting.<br />A really fun listen. Tyler's just getting better and better.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This was a good book, bit the Irish orphanage parts were hard to read, I can't believe a church run organization would treat children that way.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Prior to watching this movie, I had already read every one of Lee Childs' Reacher books and his Reacher short stories, and both Diane Capri's Reacher novels, and even Michael Kerr's \\"Reacher kind of guy\\" novel --and loved them all. . . So I came at this movie with high expectations.<br /><br />With all that out of the way. I really enjoyed this movie! I think it is a good, solidly entertaining, action movie. If you watch it, you will enjoy it. I strongly recommend it!<br /><br />Frankly, it starts off just a bit slowly, but after the first action scene, the movie picks up and never really lets down.<br /><br />The plot is not very complex, but not too skimpy either. It has suspense, movement, shooting, chases, intrigue confusion and even fun. Reacher is not all chase scenes and shoot ups, it has some interesting plot twists, but it is not going to leave you wondering what is going on either. The movie is a nice bit of escape from the day-to-day. It is a good choice.<br /><br />Also, Tom Cruz, Robert Duval, Rosamund Pike and the entire cast are very good. They move the movie along and keep us interested in the developments --it's well acted and in one sense they are stronger than the script! The city and county background are well chosen and complement the story.<br /><br />As a Jack Reacher fan, my only disappointment was that Tom Cruz, as good as he was, was not the \\"real\\" Reacher to me.  OK, I am not complaining about his height --even though Reacher is supposed to be a mountain of a man, who stands out in spite of himself -and make an impressive, if not intimidating, figure.  No, it's not his height, but there is something a bit perky, not jaded enough, socially too quick, or too upbeat and clever about Tom Cruz's approach that is just not quite Reacher.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Tom Cruz delivers some of the \\"Reacher mannerisms\\" very crisply and nicely. He also has some of Reacher's speech and manner. Perhaps I just can't see Reacher as a handsome superstar. . .<br /><br />Also, in the novels, Reacher's smarts are deep, quiet and homegrown. But they also are sharply honed by his experiences. He uses and expresses his savvy skills in a subtle manner (when he's not pummeling or shooting someone that is).  In this movie, however,  Reacher gets into a \\"can you top this\\" or \\"stump the chump\\" back-and-forth with the detective in a peculiar way. Also, Reacher  would not get hit by surprise from behind quite like he does that one time in the movie (sorry, in case you did not want to know ;-).<br /><br />So for me, things like that distanced Tom Cruz from my Reacher image a bit. However, Tom Cruz does makes his Reacher quite interesting, very exciting and always appealing none the less. I was watching and enjoying every scene.<br /><br />And that's the point: Even as a \\"Reacher Fan,\\" I was pulled quickly out of the \\"book-and-character-comparison\\" mode and dropped right into the \\"let's see how he gets out of this\\" mode.\\" And that's enough!<br /><br />In short, a good movie  :-). . .<br /><br />Also, in the novels, Reacher's smarts are deep, quiet and homegrown.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|decent writing, but it dragged for me. I couldn't get into the characters and was mildly satisfied with the ending
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Challenging without making me want to quit...only downside is brain continues to orbit after I turn game off...this review is now concluded
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters are engaging and the story line is good. Love this show, wish there were more episodes! Worth watching from the beginning.
B003K16P3M|5.0|The beginning of this book was rough as its talking about nothing but fictional places it was pretty confusing. When I forced myself to just read past it, it got really good!I am so happy I stuck through the first few chapters to find a beautiful story. I will be most certainly reading the other 2 books now. I absolutely adored this book.
B005PK1G76|5.0|What a perfect solution. Great price. and to top it off it's insulated so your drinks stay cold. Much better price than the baby jogger accessory that does the same thing.
0375851569|5.0|perfect for new readers. The adventures of Dr. Seuss are always interesting and attractive for little kids. My 5 years old has lots of fun reading them.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|This is a fabulous dvd series.  Can't wait for season three.  The action is wonderful.  The costuming is marvelous.  The characters are so deliciously evil
B00A757EFW|1.0|I tried to play the game and it does not work.  IT keeps getting locked up.  I Wish I could get my money back.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|Can't go wrong with Steve Martin, Owen Wilson & Jack Black!<br />Plus it's a peek into the quirky world of devoted bird watchers!<br /><br />Enjoy,<br />Frame Girl
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love the dragons and how you can raise them. Love the fact that I can wait and come back.<br />Hate the fact that I have the wait so long to do stuff. And my game freeze every time i try to buy gold (on my tablet.) SO I just use coins and make the best of it. It has glitches but overall fun and enjoyable when I'm bored.
B000005H3R|5.0|Got many cds by Dianne Reeves.<br />Just love her voice and the backing band.<br />Go out and get one of her cds, you won't be sorry!
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|I wasn't looking forward to this one. Got it just to complete what I'd started. Turned out to be my favorite so far!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a fantastic book<br />I have read this series at least 10 times and each time I seem to find new things that I missed previously. This love story is the best thing I have read in years can't wait for the movie to come out.
B008M721MS|3.0|Learning and growing everyday. My kindle is a great way to communicate with all my contacts and keep up to date with all my family.
0307279189|5.0|I'm 43 and have been running for 20 years.  I've run 5 marathons, countless half marathons, and average 30-40 miles a week even when not training for an actual event.  I've had my share of injuries, but so far have been lucky enough to push through them.  And I have been doing everything wrong for all that time.<br /><br />Now, I'm a skeptic and don't generally follow the crowd on any big running fad or idea.  Nevertheless, this book has completely changed my approach, renewed my love of the sport, and caused me to completely overhaul my entire running lifestyle.  This is far more than a \\"running\\" book - it's a story about human endurance, the perfection that is evolution, a great adventure story, and a wake-up call for the running industry and scientists who think - insanely - that the best thing to do to the arch of your foot is to support it from below.  Human beings, despite conventional wisdom, are running machines.  We're supposed to run.  Our bodies appear, in fact, to be designed totally around our ability to run incredible distances without fading, without injury, without dropping dead of a heart attack.<br /><br />Extremely well-written, well-researched, and well-told.  Whether you run or want to run, you should read this book.  If you don't run and never wanted to - you should read this book.  Fantastic.  I can't recommend it enough.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Really fun and addicting game. It's nice to have a game to play after a long day at work that doesn't require a lot of thought but is still fun enough to hold your interest.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|Quality tools from quality materials and nice fit and finish. They sent me a set with a cracked tray, they corrected this but it took some time.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|Duncan Whitehead has once again created a charming, engaging story that is a pleasure to read. \\"An Actor's Life\\" is an entertaining snapshot into the life of Terry Sparkes, a has-been actor who's career might have been very different if not for his greed and pride.<br /><br />Mr. Whitehead does a marvelous job of presenting a sympathetic protagonist who is far from being an exemplary human being--an impressive feat that showcases the author's growing skills as a writer and storyteller. There was little to admire about Terry, and yet the ironic comeuppance fate deals him at the end made me feel sorry for him.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"An Actor's Life\\" for a quick getaway into the life of a complex, fascinating character and the wistful, forlorn world that he's created for himself.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|Wow. This is based on a true story so creepy factor is through the roof. Um, the acting is great all across the board. The story speaks for itself but it is about a serial killer that was &#34;never caught&#34;. You really need to watch this movie if you are into horror movies or you are into stories about serial killers.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This set periodically goes in and out of production.  When it goes out of production, the price immediately spikes, often by 100%.  It's been as high as $140 in the past.<br /><br />This shows that it's a good set for investment, provided you can buy it at the right price.  Once LEGO discontinues it for good, demand has already shown that the prices will go up significantly -- and that could be tomorrow or it could be two years from now.<br /><br />Do I think it's that great of a set?  No, not unless you're a huge fan of Minecraft.  There's not many unique or interesting pieces, and it's a fairly straight forward build with fairly standard bricks.  The piece count seems high at first, but it's all very small bits and pieces.  Perhaps if I had gotten several of them and pieced them together, I would have enjoyed it more.  Or maybe I just need to be a Minecraft fan.<br /><br />Either way, you know if you want it or not.  Just make sure you get it at the right price.  No sense paying collectible prices when LEGO is still periodically releasing them.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This was a birthday present for my husband and he loves it! The piano guys are awesome! Can't wait for their next CD.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|If ever there was the perfect example of role reversal, \\"Tucker & Dale vs. Evil\\" is it. The feel is very melodramatic, horror-action based, ironic and extremely funny. It honestly surprises me that Tucker and Dale don't have a full-on franchise after this one, but it certainly stands alone as an excellent definition of the characters. I certainly recommend this one to fans of horror-comedy and schlock or grindhouse-type films, such as \\"The Comedy of Terrors\\", \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", \\"Black Sheep\\", \\"Planet Terror\\" and the \\"Cabin Fever\\" films.
B007SNMVH2|5.0|in a world of overpriced &#34;next big thing&#34; hyped up technology this blu-ray was not priced as stupid as most that I see
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I have never did a search without coming up with a result. I think that it reliable. I would recommend this to any of my freinds
B000MZHW40|5.0|This is a true eye opener for me. Diamonds.... Wow.. I don't think that I will ever look at them the same again. It is about the diamonds exported from Africa and the impact it has had on the country and its people. It is astounding and real. The acting is phenomenal and the story is action packed. I would recommend this movie highly to everyone. It made me change the way I look at diamonds forever.
B009LJZJL6|4.0|slight moldy smell like and older book but the binding looks good and the pages aren't folded or crinkled :)
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I chose the title because I feel this book will help heal someone going through a difficult time.<br />Even though Jaycee's situation is unique others can relate to being so shy you're unable to speak up for yourself. There are also other situations in the book that the readers can identify with Jaycee.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|Even after being told what to expect, this film was still not what I'd expected. I was told it was a B horror movie with cheesy effects and a super-low budget. Honestly, it wasn't so much horror as a sci-fi thriller, the troll models were more than on par with even Lord of the Rings (let alone the inexplicably-big-budgeted, ubiquitously-referenced Cloverfield), the dialogue was very naturalistic, the characters often saying precisely what I'm sure I would when facing off against a hairy monster the size of a Madison Avenue office building, and the acting was very believable. Of course, there were flaws, such as that the computer-generated trolls didn't interact seamlessly with the environment (good example: every non-humanoid, non-horse creature in the Hobbit), and the shaky camera movement did make things a little disorienting (though they kept it within reason, unlike the projectile-vomit-inducing Blair Witch Project). All in all, though, what few issues there were have been present in virtually every movie since the advent of CGI modeling (watch I Am Legend and try to say those things move more convincingly than the trolls). Some may have a problem with its being in Bokmål with English subtitles, but it only takes a few minute to get used to the flow of it. Far from a blood-and-guts creature feature horror film, Trollhunter is an excellent fusion of fantasy, mystery, and action.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I had heard The Hobbit was not that good but I thought I'd reserve judgement and see for myself.<br /><br />Now that I have seen it, I have to say there is much that is good in the movie but I really hope some elements don't continue, such as episodes like that of the Goblin King. The Goblin King was not even slightly scary. It was like I'd suddenly been dropped into a Disney movie, and then I remembered Derek/Robert from Bad Taste and other similar Peter Jackson humour and thought \\"You know, I shouldn't be having to remember Bad Taste in the middle of The Hobbit\\". PJ needs to leave that stuff out. It wasn't that funny in Bad Taste either.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|What can you say at this point?  Sanderson did a great job with Jordan's vision.  Great ending...will they really let it be the ending?<br /><br />Egwene is my hero.  I was never a hater but she moved up 50 notches in this book.
193700788X|1.0|Let's see, where to begin?  On some level, I can understand CH's decision to ultimately split Eric and Sookie.  I get it.  But the whole book reeks of sloppy decision-making and bizarre inconsistencies. CH tried to shoehorn a bunch of manufactured feelings into a few pages and then clap \\"All done!\\".  Because of this sloppiness, I think CH lost the credibility (and the fans' trust) to make a big move like splitting this couple up.  Had she plotted these stories with more skill and care, many of her fans would have been disappointed with the break-up, but I don't think you'd see this level of anger.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game lots of fun....like the different levels and special rewards....easy to play...the more friends on facebook that play the better!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Yee-haw, folks! Yee-haw. I got turned on to country pop last summer when my best friend--hello, Dzhokhar!--sent me a link to one of Lyla Antebellum's songs on YouTub. Prior to this, I thought that only Shakira and maybe Kid Rock could successfully cross over into country pop, but boy, was I wrong. Happily so! I just got back from my local Piggly Wiggly after camping out for several minutes in my lawn chair to be the very first person below the Mason-Dixon Line to hopefully get my greasy fingers on Golden.<br /><br />Golden is golden. That's all I have to say on this fine, fine CD that is about as sweet as Frederick Douglas fighting for the Confederates after throwing off the shackles of slavery, homes. It's about as sweet as President Andrew Jackson and the Trail of Tears, miha. Let's look at the song selection on this dope and phat CD, yo.<br /><br />Get to Me starts this CD off the right way: by being a very sexy and suggestive song that makes Katy Perry and Lady Gaga seem like a bunch of nuns. I like the way this song has been utterly sexed up, almost more sexed up than what the liberals accused Bush and Blair of doing to the Iraq WMD report back in 2003, baby! Yeah! Better Off Now That You're Gwone is not quite as sexy, but it still gets me off very easily. I love listening to this song as I contemplate autoerotic asphyxiation, David Carradine-style. Yeah, baby!<br /><br />In sum, this is the CD that you want blasting out of your 2-disc Sharp mini-stereo bookshelf unit that you hopefully have right beside your bidet. I know I do. Please go out and purchase this CD from Amazon right now, even if you need food stamps to survive thanks to Obama's ruination of the economy. It's worth it, miha!
0743554434|5.0|I loved the Kite Runner and this book is just as wonderful. I will listen to this audio book over and over as I did with the Kite Runner
0156027321|2.0|As far as I can tell, I am the only person in the world that did not did NOT care for this book. Why? I have no idea, but it just didn't keep my attention. I felt like it was trying to be to much at one time. It wasn't so much a story as a long sermon on people, what they are, and how we (should or should not) perceive them...
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Such an easy game to play!!  Son and Husband both love it and it's a very addicting game!!  And it's FREE!
B009VB97EY|1.0|I thought this would be a great movie.  Matthew McConaughey should make it worthwhile, right?  Beefcake alone is not enough.  OMG....so boring.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|Thank goodness it was free because it has to be the most frustrating thing I have downloaded in a while. The game itself looks fun and a good way to waste some time but the controls are horrible. You can only swipe the steering wheel left and right. I found myself trying to spin it with my finger, especially since it is designed like a steering wheel. I gave up and delete  the game.
B00BCX2F66|4.0|I bought this case from the Sprint store at the same time I got the One. I hadn't planned on buying a case, so had done no research into them. What sold me on it at the store was the fact that it could stand up and there was a cover over the screen. I use my phone for reading A LOT, so being able to prop it up in its own case was very attractive to me. I previously owned the orginal Evo with kickstand, and then the Evo3D without one. I bought a kickstand case for that phone, but didn't like the bulk or how hard it was to get the phone in and out of the case. The Double Dip Flip seemed to be a nice slim fitting case that could be propped up, and I was very pleasantly suprised by how much I actually like it. It is a very good fit - I don't have any of the problems others have posted about the phone just slipping out of the case. In fact, I tried to shake the phone out of the case just holding the screen cover - some really hard shaking and the phone didn't budge. The cutouts are all in the right place and don't impede plugging in the power cord or headphones at all. It props up well at a couple of different viewing angles and stays in place nicely. I also like the feel of the case in my hand. I really only have two negatives - 1. as others have said the screen cover doesn't really stay closed, but I've just gotten into the habit of putting the phone screen down on my desk, so I don't see the cover sticking up. I think a little tabbed closure that \\"snaps\\" over the side when closed would have been good here. This was my biggest reason for docking it 1 star. My #2 issue with case is the interior color - I would have liked an all black option. However, I bought it knowing it was red, so I can't complain too much :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome! The graphics are great. Playing is very addictive and I spend more time with my &quot;horses&quot; than reading now. I recommend that anyone try this game and see if they don't love it!
B00422LESO|5.0|Cute, witty, nothing hard hitting and overwrought with emotion. Perfect for that crummy day when you need a pick me up!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I love the game and that it is all about dinosaurs but I do not like how long it takes for them to evolve and when they are evolving you have to use coins to build up a DNA stand and it doesn't always give you the full DNA strand it can take SEVERAL tries to get this to happen.  Meanwhile while this is happening that dinosaur doesn't collect any coins you have no access to it at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Not bad at all, close to my favorite app of all time. A temple run with an even better concept. Those who do not enjoy skill games such as those would still find a reason to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an industry game changer.  Very good format.  Entertaining. Addictive and straight out fun.  The levels are challenging yet inviting.  Impact to the gaming industry feels like that which Donkey Kong or Mario bros.  Had back in the day.<br />Can't help looking forward to the updates and new locations.<br /><br />This game is highly recommended for users of all ages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very good app. it changed my life! I know all about horses now. fun and friendly for kids of all ages! get this app. you'll love it forever!
193700788X|1.0|I don't know if anyone is going to feel the same way, but I'm extremely disappointed with the way the final Sookie Stackhouse book ended. Neither do I want to be a poor sport, and give anything away with the long rant I'd had planned. I'll only say this; it feels like the last five years of my life with all thirteen books was a complete waste of time. How can you love them if it doesn't end the way you had wished it to?<br /><br />The plot in itself was entertaining enough, as a majority of the Sookie books are. The action is never-ending and almost every chapter ends with excitement that continues into the next chapter. That is the reason one gobbles these books up in quick succession. In this final volume Sookie is accused of murdering former friend Arlene soon after Arlene's release from prison (where she went in book 10? after attempting to kill Sookie). The evidence is shady and no one really believes Sookie did it anyway, so she is released on bail. After that it is a race against time to find Arlene's killer, clear her name and conclude her \\"happily ever after.\\"<br /><br />About 50 pages from the end, when you realize what \\"guy\\" she ends up with, I was so upset that I lost most of the steam required to finish it. (And I'm using the guy in quotations since the only men she's been interested in are either vampires or supes). But why did she choose him? I just don't get it, and perhaps the author didn't either. The first four books were fantastic; after that they slowly and progressively get worse. Plot lines got more ridiculous with each one. Sigh.<br /><br />I do notice that Ms. Harris has the \\"After Dead\\" book planned in October and it looks like it will explain somethings/some characters after \\"DEA\\"s conclusion. Perhaps I'll read that and find some true closure. But for now, in this instance, a disappointing flop! Sad I had to waste my money on this.
B0000524E5|5.0|The price was right, the item was right on time, and I watched it right away. It's definitely a classic &#34;chick flick&#34; I would recommend any &#34;chick&#34; to watch.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely loved Hugh Howey's Wool Omnibus! The books get progressively longer, and the plot progressively tense. I felt like I was living in the Silo, experiencing every exciting moment right along with the characters. This is a must-read! As I read the book I could picture no one other than Jewel Staite to play the role of Jules in the movie.
B00632HWOG|2.0|the Yahoo mail app on my kindle sucked. it was constantly freezing and shutting itself down. it also was starting to run slower and slower. I've started using the ymail mobile app and have been much happier with it so far.
B004G600A4|5.0|I bought this DVD fro my grandaughter who enjoys watching it over and over again she just can't get enought of it.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|I went to see this movie with my daughter and I wasn't impressed.. I enjoy the original Wizard of Oz with Judy Garland the best!!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Great sound and feel, reminds me of the feeling I had when I first heard discovery come out. Can't wait to hear whole album
B001TH16DI|4.0|It was delightful to watch these classic movies in HD BD format, it really brought them back to life. The visuals and sound are superb, and the additional disk with cast interviews and commentaries is a nice bonus. Also the price paid through Amazon was a far better value than anywhere else I looked at.<br />I would've given it a 5 star rating if the movies had included the deleted scenes found on previous editions.  Even then they are enjoyable as they are in their original theatrical versions. Is definitely a must have set to upgrade your DVD version of it, or even better as a new addition to your collection.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Growing up in the personal computer revolution, this book and the authors powerful message through Jobs mantra of technology at the intersection of humanity can help us lead more inspired lives.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|Lots of fun. Quirky -- like the cartoon balloons that remind me of the old Batman TV series. Yes...your that old if you can remember Adam West.<br /><br />Recommended.
B007MDB71O|4.0|Great movie that the whole family can enjoy.  Bad press unfairly tainted this movie.  I actually enjoyed movie even more on second viewing.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Really good. App just fun just plane fun  lol ( btw r they jello or pudding  lol maybe jello they look like jello ) nvm also btw I'm named promise not aron that's my mom's name
B0017SWPXY|5.0|All I wil say is Enzo's facsination with opposeable thumbs is awsome. I love the ending If you love dogs you will love this book
B00957T6X6|5.0|This series has held me completely riveted from the first chapter of book one. So well written. Holding my breath for book six.......
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's really just a glorified soap opera, but delivers plenty of drama and laughs too. Worth watching if only for Maggie Smith!
B005IEGUDY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this work, having grown up in the West Country. It was like a trip back home. Thank you so much.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Hands down, this game and its sequel, Super Stickman 2, are my personal favorite games. Game play is true to the physics necessary to succeed. Graphics are just right for each task - nothing superfluous here! Although timing is essential, this is no race against the clock. Practice pays off in this game and the gradual increase in difficulty is at an appropriate rate. Although I am not a golfer myself, this is my favorite time-waster, being at once challenging, fun and relaxing. All thumbs up for this one!!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie deserves 5 stars. All-around excellent movie that was very entertaining. I would watch it again and have already recommended this movie to friends.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is amazing it is so addicting. I play it a lot it has so many features like multiplayer is awesome because there is so many modes in it and also there are lots of guns and upgrades in story mode. I recommend that you get this app.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|We are reminded of past mistakes in history that are brought to light again in this book.  It is heartwarming .
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the ease of Amazon instant video! Makes watching your favorite movies on the go easy and enjoyable! great show!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I enjoy playing this game to help me relax after a long day at work. Still trying to figure things out but still worth while.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Fun for a free game. the only thing I don't like is that you don't make a lot of money for the quests it puts you on. you earn maybe $500 then to buy most pony's or stuff it thousands of dollars and I am not one to actually purchase money or jewels in a free game,  so I just plod along a few minutes at a time a few times a day. you don't get far fast but it does pass the time:)
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I thought it was boring... some funny parts, but mostly shallow with no substance. I would not rent this movie, it is a waste of money!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game was pretty addicting until one day i was going to play the app and everything was gone.All my status was deleted :( do not get it if you do hope it works. DON'T GET IT
193700788X|3.0|Keep in mind that a lot of the reviews are by people up in arms about the HEA leaked on the internet.  This review is based on the actual book. I'm not going to whine and moan about the ending but I'll definitely agree with the complaints that this one just wasn't nearly as well written.  It was set up like a TV series finale where everyone makes an appearance but they don't add much to the story.  It was one giant cluster trying to weave all of these different character perspectives and locations together into one.  I don't regret reading the book and I'll be interested in reading the coda but I really can't say I enjoyed it very much.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|David Mack is an awesome writer! He explains every detail of their actions and the scene which enables you to visualize every moment in this series. His storyline is great as well and I am very intrigued by the character of Dr. Soong. I really wish they would make this into a movie. It's a great story and it was written so well that it can be easily adapted into a screenplay.<br />I'm on the second book in the series now and will review that when I am finished as well.<br />Great job David Mack!<br />[[ASIN:1451650728 Star Trek: The Next Generation: Cold Equations: The Persistence of Memory: Book One]]
B003EV6DBW|5.0|Doctor is is fantastic and even better in blu-ray form!  I'm glad they released these in the US for the fans here!
B009YX02T8|4.0|Took a few listens through but then it was on repeat in my car. I wish there were a few more upbeat songs, but all of the songs are nice to listen to, especially on a crisp, cool, spring morning!
B009CCBCU4|4.0|Never heard/read anything about this...good story and intriguing information. Will order #2. Just another proof that there is always so much to learn!
0439023521|5.0|I really loved this book. It's one of those \\"un-put-down-able\\" books. It me a couple of hours to read it and I am looking forward to re-reading it all over again. Awesome story.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I'm an oldies fan and rarely stray out of the 70s and 80s music I grew up with, but after watching the PBS special which featured many of the songs on this CD, I regret not having been able to follow this special musician from the beginning of his career. When I mentioned Joe Bonamassa to several friends, most of them were also unfamiliar with his music but have since become converts.  Watching the perfomance made me appreciate the skills of the five musicians featured and enhanced my enjoyment of the acoustic renditions of each song when I did receive the CD. I have not been able to compare these versions to the original ones, but I plan to do so in the near future. Favorites of mine include Dust Bowl, Athens to Athens, Dislocated Boy (which reminds me of Boz Scaggs' early work) and two which did not appear on PBS, Driving Towards the Daylight and Mountain Time. I always tell my friends who scoff at my oldies addiction that I haven't liked much of the music in the past thirty years, but Joe Bonamassa's An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House is one of the best collections I've heard.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The alarm clock has all the features. Setting several alarms, snooze (you set duration), weather. As well as, choosing the clock style you would like. Works Great!!!
B005M2A4DE|5.0|Doctor is is fantastic and even better in blu-ray form!  I'm glad they released these in the US for the fans here!
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Finally after a long wait the final book of the &#34;Wheel of Time&#34; and it was worth waiting for. Just couldn't put it down.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man That Invented the 20th Century is  well-written and easy to read and understand.  I enjoyed it immensely, being a huge fan of Nkola Tesla.  Anyone who is not familiar with Tresla but wants to learn about him should definitely read this book as a first look at the man and his accomplishments. I would recommend this book to both children and adults.  Both will find it inspiring.

B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|When The Hobbit was released I read most of the reviews and got instantly depressed. The movie was slow. The movie was dull. The movie was bad. Almost everyone who eventually went to see The Hobbit went in spite of the critics and those wretched reviews. As I watch the blu-ray version of The Hobbit for the third time, I can't help asking anyone who'll listen: what on Earth were the critics watching? What movie did they see and we missed? The Hobbit is a bit more detailed than LOTR, that is true. I think Peter Jackson was responding to those lovers of Tolkien's books who missed some of the whimsy, some of the poetry, some of the songs found in Tolkien that was left out of the three LOTR films out of necessity. So Jackson gives us some of the songs and whimsy and the critics (most of whom have never read any of Tolkien's books) complain. The Hobbit is a brilliant and exciting film. The two follow-up films promise to be even better as they conclude The Hobbit story and begin Sauron's rise in Mirkwood as The Necromancer. As for the critics: perhaps that's why they write about films rather than make them.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Am glad to have this DVD, so I can share it with my family who did not see it in the movie theater.
B002QYSZBO|5.0|I love great dialogue play.. this reminds me a bit of Joss Whedon's character development through dialogue (a lot of it even in passing and hard to catch.) Two great comedy actors who have the depth to get down and dirty in the drama. Direction is fascinating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is great! I loved it so much!!! This book is great for kids 10 and up, no younger!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I've been wearing this watch for a few weeks now and I am very happy with the purchase. I worried that the cloth band would need to be replaced right away, but actually like it. It seems pretty sturdy and I rarely take the watch off for chores. I love the contrast of the face which makes it easy to read. Overall, I can't think of a single thing not to like about this watch. If I lost it or it got broken I would definitely buy another just like it!
193700788X|1.0|Thanks to all the spoilers, I won't purchase DEA.  The last few books have been a disappointment -- loaded with  plots and character developments that simply did not jive with the earlier books. I've felt for some time there isn't much that could be done to save the storyline so I can't entirely blame my lack of interest on the spoilers.  Maybe Ms. Harris was bored with the series and really intended it to end at book 8 or so?  Maybe she's pissed with her audience for trying to tell her what to do with her characters and was thinking, I'll show them?  Maybe she doesn't care about book sales?  I dunno? What I do know is, I won't be buying. I enjoyed the first 7, maybe 8 books, so I'll leave well enough alone and bid the story adieu.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Keeps you wanting more. I would read more from this author. I enjoyed Cathy's strength to keep going and not give in
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|\\"I'm only seventeen years old, but I know something she doesn't know: I know that life isn't life if you just float through it. I know that the whole point - the only point - is to find the things that matter, and hold on to them, and fight for them, and refuse to let them go.\\"<br /><br />Wow. I just...I don't even...I can't...wow.<br /><br />Let me try that again. That ending really got me. This book was more of a slow burn for me until about 60% or so through it. The writing was beautiful through the whole book, but the second half of the book was better than the first, for me anyway.<br /><br />It is definitely an interesting concept that Lauren Oliver has come up with, that love is the deadliest of diseases. This was one of the more believable dystopian worlds because the world is still recognizable. The US is still the US with the same state names. Many aspects of life are still the same, just add in more control by the government and the \\"cure\\" for love. I find the cure interesting and I hope that the next 2 books clarify exactly what the cure consists of.<br /><br />Okay, I'm off to read [[ASIN:0061978078 Pandemonium (Delirium)]].
B00908DDZM|5.0|I happen to hear a song (first track) from the album on the internet and was pleasantly surprised.  I thought it had potential.  Then I listened to the another song (fifth track) and became hooked.  Starting Over completely locked me into appreciating what hip hop can actually offer the world.  This is the first hip hop album that actually gave me an insight on what it means to actually be human.  This work of art has added a great deal of respect for what hip hop can contribute to the world.  I recommend this album to every genre of music lover because the words lifts it up to a level beyond what one would expect of the average album.  The only negative thing I can say is that the album has set a standard for all music that I do not believe the majority of music creators can live up to.  It transcends music, poetry, and spirituality to take one to a place where the soul lives.  I am a complete fan of The Heist.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|The game is fast paced and engrossing.  The controls are intuitive and responsive.  I have only played for a couple of days and I am enjoying it.  it did lock up once and I hope that was a one time thing.  I would reccomend this game.
193700788X|1.0|This book was an abject failure on many levels and personally I think it shows that Charlaine Harris has no respect for her fans. I'm not going to give out spoilers, but these are my msin issues with the book:<br /><br />The writing was not as polished as it should have been.<br /><br />There were contradictions that made no sense based on the previous books. Ms Harris should read or reread the Harry Potter series to get an understanding of how continuity should be followed.<br /><br />Personally I don't feel she kept the integrity of her characters intact. Did I like all the twists and turns in Harry Potter?  No!!!  But they fit with the integrity of the story. Same goes for many other books that had no Happily Ever After due to situations or death or whatever.<br /><br />And actually I'm very angry to the point of angry tears of impotent rage over the betrayal Ms Harris brought to her Sookie fans. If the book had been well written, kept the integrity of the characters and situation I would not be giving this one star. I feel betrayed  The fictional town and its characters were like well known friends.  Ms Harris really missed the boat with this book. It is like she was tired of the series and just phoned this one in.<br /><br />Well Ms Harris I do promise you one thing. And that is--I will never ever read another one of your books.

0143038419|1.0|At the risk of repeating pretty much everything that all the reviewers who hated this book have already said, I will simply say that if you feel compelled to read it because of all the hype, then just read the \\"Eat\\" part.  The rest is just awful.  On the other hand, if you jealously guard your all-too-few free hours to devote to reading, then give it a total pass.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a game that you can pick up and go. Its very addictive to where if you and your friends continuously compete against each other then you will always try to beat each others score. There are customizable items like your person or your board. It doesn't get boring because they change the scenery every once in a while so you don't get bored because you are just doing the same map over and over again. To me this is a simple game that has simple goals to do. But it has no flaws to it that I can see. I would recommend this game for any gamer or to someone that just want to kill some time every once in a while.

081297381X|2.0|Taleb has both an interesting story and theory. But the way he attempts to weave them together leaves me wishing he would have written a book on one or the other.
0316228532|1.0|I was so looking forward to this book.  I loved the Harry Potter series so when my book club chose it as a group read I was thrilled.  After so many of us couldn't even choke through half of it.  It was cancelled as the club read.  That's how bad it is.  Long drawn out chapters, written in great boring detail. And I do mean great boring detail.  For instance, do we really need to know how a toddlers turd sounds when it hits the toilet water?  Because she actually described it. The author goes on and on about characters she can't make the reader care about. The plot is set in the very first couple of pages, with a death.  After that you spend the rest of your time waiting for what you hope will be the real plot, but it never happens.  Really she could have just written.  So and So died.....the end.  I gave it one star only because I couldn't give it a minus star rating.  This book was in a word.  Disappointing.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|This is the first book written by David sedaris that I have read. It will not be the last. I found the book interesting and funny and sad.  Sedaris is a likable author and I look forward to reading about more of his life in his other books.

B005S9EK5Y|4.0|This is really a captivating rendition of the show and I found so much of it very moving.  Russell Crowe did his stalwart best with Javert, but in truth his singing is not even up to snuff for a high school musical, let alone a major film production of such a great stage work.  I admire him because it's clear he really worked hard to make this as good as could be, but the audience should not have to capitulate to such a poor casting choice.  A unknown with a singer's voice would have been a better choice.  Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman were truly impressive, but I can't fight the urge to root out the person who coached their vocal preparation, and urge them to take up another career.  Properly coached these two could have won complete and utter acclaim for these roles.  Some of the sounds Hugh Jackman made absolutely thrilled me, but also so many badly placed sounds....so many vowels pinched....so many great musical phrase turned into kitschy singing because he was not prepared well for this.  The ensemble pieces were brilliant and the choral sound was thrilling.<br /><br />If only the performance overall could have been on a par with Thénardier and Madame Thénardier and conveyed the outstanding singing done on roles of Cosette, Epinone, & Marius this review would be five stars.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|It was a great read for our book club-- I loved the many layers of meaning woven by the flowers.  The capacity of the human heart to forgive and redefine family is key.  Though there were times I wanted to shaken Victoria, it was understandable that her character would have so much self-doubt.  Pick it up and read it...you'll be glad you did.

B009AMAGQM|2.0|I was looking forward to watching this after I finished the series. I knew going in that the movie would not be exactly like the book, but I did not expect it to be so different. I was very disappointed almost as soon as it started. It seems like the only thing they used the book for was the names of the characters! So much was changed and/or left out. I don't know how they will be able to continue the movies based on the rest of the books.
B0054NQZ9S|4.0|I thought the movie and storyline of the movie were both very good.  Having been laid off twice during this period I thought it was pretty accurate in its depiction of the underhanded ways that people are treated in corporate America.  I do think the language was a little over the top, especially in business situations.  Maybe they really talk that way on the east coast.  In my experience using language that was frequently used in the movie was considered unprofessional. Also, any guy that would leave his wife for the woman who just fired him should have his man card taken away.
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|I love DP, love all versions that their ever were of the band.  Loved Slaves and Masters, House of the Blue Light and Purpendicular.  I thought Steve Morse brought a fresh kick in the butt to this band with Purpendicular.  Abandon had a harder edge to it, and would unfortunately be Jon Lord's last full effort with the boys. Then Bananas and Rapture were both great, but I couldn't help feel they were just by the numbers albums, were nothing was truly memorable but they weren't bad albums.  Now What ?! finds the boys with a fresh energy that you can hear on Purpendicular, but whereas Steve Morse ran the gauntlet on that album, this time Don Airey finds his footing in the band.  Don Airey's keyboard presence on this album, is well, un traditional of any Deep Purple line up or album since maybe Mark II's In Rock.  And while that is definitely not a bad thing, it does sound a bit overdone in this day and age, almost going over the top to show how much Jon Lord is missed to not only the boys in the band, but to rockers and rollers all around the world.  It's beautiful to hear, it's just too bad we are hearing this keyboard prominence after the passing of Jon Lord.  Not to dwindle off on that path, the wit and humor of Ian Gillan's vocals and lyrics are still present, Roger and Paicy still anchor that DP sound, and Steve Morse, I feel, this is his most reserved outing with Purple.  He's channeling the classic sound on this album more than any other album he's been featured on.  A great album nonetheless, it's a stretch to call this their best since 84's Perfect Strangers, or '96's Purpendicular,  but it's definitely more interesting and memorable than Bananas and Rapture.  If your a fan it's yet another evolution in the sound of the Purple machine, pick it up!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have been a Sookie fan since the first installment in the series. I have to agree with the other readers who have expressed their disappointment with this final installment. I also agree with the reviewer who recommended not buying the book for those diehard fans who want to read the book, but to instead borrow a copy from their library. I think the premise of the book was created to allow Ms. Harris the opportunity to round up major figures in previous novels and have them waft in and out of the narrative. I am TRULY disappointed in the way Eric and Sookie's relationship played out. He is hardly a presence in the book. I am giving the book two stars rather than one, because Harris at least writes well. I should have waited to read a library copy, instead of wasting $15.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can only imagine that if you're reading this you haven't started watching the series (or the season). STOP. READING. GO. WATCH.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such a nice game with frequent updates making us to feel its a brand new game at all times. Dont even know how time runs with it
0316069884|5.0|Not overly grotesk like some of the animal rights books are - but highly informative. This man just wanted to figure out what was in the food he was feeding to his son. I would suggest everyone read this at least once.
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|Nothing bad to say about this album.  The title track is exquisite; as are Charles' Kelley's vocals. Downtown is very snappy.  Hilary Scott does a great job; and doesn't over sell it.  Charles Kelley's singing on Goodbye Town is amazing.  New life was breathed into Better Off (Without You).  Generation Away is a real change of pace for the group.  Glad that they stepped away from the duets.  Love it...
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This charger is simply fantastic! It's very powerful for it's size and I charged my iPhone 4 three times and also charged a friends iPhone and mine simultaneously to full charge and there was still power to spare!<br />Very, very satisfied this this battery pack charger.
0142410314|5.0|This lovely and entertaining novel is one of the classics of children's literature, a reputation that's well earned. Charlie is an immediately likeable and sympathetic protagonist, and his adventures in the Chocolate Factory are the stuff of dreams.<br /><br />Mr. Willy Wonka remains an enigma even after numerous readings, but his manic charm still casts a spell on me. And finally, the element of morality here presents an admirable lesson for children: the spoiled brats get their comeuppance, as do the doting parents who spoil them.
B008OHV5QO|5.0|While I usually dislike interview/concert music DVDs, I really enjoyed this one because Neil Young takes you on a visit to his hometown in rural Canada, sharing places and memories. The live music mixed in is excellent, great sound and performances.
0938045768|4.0|My friend recommended this book. He is able to do one arm pull-ups and he is not a body builder. I thought I would give it a whirl. I have been dealing with rotator impingement/tendonitis issues for many years. I started out once last year on this program and was doing really great until I reached the wrong way (not from the program) and had to start all over after getting an injection. I am back on the path to a stronger shoulder.<br /><br />I totally agree that starting slowly is going to be the best approach to getting my shoulder in tip-top condition. As a women, I would think the abdomen exercises are going to be great. I am on phase one but hope to get to phase two by July. This is a slow process but I feel it is completely worth it. I want to build my muscles slowly to prevent damage especially since I am over 50. I will never get to one-arm pull ups because I don't feel the need at my age but keeping my muscles strong is very important. I look younger than my age and I want the strength of my body to match my appearance.<br /><br />I am not stopping.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|We have been waiting so long for this to come out.  It is graphically as wonderful as the first 3 and we are so looking forward to the next to to come out as well.  Happy watching!!
B00BG4RLF6|2.0|Sparsely populated electronic waverings accompanied by high pitched vocal warbelings.  At times he sounds like a young man approaching adolescence, voice cracking and wavering all over the place.  The music I would give 3 stars.  I wanted to like this artist, but he starts to annoy me after the first 10-20 seconds.  I don't really write a lot of reviews, but felt that I should forewarn people that James Blake's style is VERY unique (can be a good thing at times).  At least preview a few tracks (unlike I did) before buying.  I love music of all types, my favorite being this style of minimal eletronica, but I just could not get into this stuff.  Preview it-- maybe you'll love it.  To me it is the worst album I've purchased in the last two years.  That being said, I admire his approach for being different and his own unique sound.  I don't know, maybe it will grow on me.  This is ART.  You might love it like all the other reviewers...
0142423432|4.0|My six-year-old niece loves this book! I read it aloud to her, a few chapters a night, while she stayed with me in the city over a long weekend. It was a bedtime ritual we both enjoyed.<br /><br />Mr. Fox (who truly is fantastic, not to mention resourceful and brave!) keeps his family safe from the nasty farmers, who are among the least sympathetic characters (and thus the most delightfully entertaining!) in the entire Dahl oeuvre.<br /><br />A classic animal adventure. Highly recommended!
1582406723|4.0|I have been a big fan of the show all along. I love zombie stories so when I saw this show coming I set my DVR as early as I could. After that first episode I was thoroughly hooked. Almost half way through the season I learned that the show was based off of this comic series. I was curious, but didn't feel the need to rush out and get these. After seeing the end of season three and talking with people who have read these, my wife and I decided we had to read these now.<br /><br />I'm so glad we decided to read these. It was great to re-live the first season and see how these characters were originally written. I also like the differences between the show and the comic. This books seemed to be pretty close to the show, but there were a few things that had been changed. The writing that hooked us in the first episode of the show is clearly evident in this book.<br /><br />The artwork threw me a bit, I was expecting color artwork full of detail and gore. When I opened it I was surprised to see black and white pages, and the artwork wasn't as strong as I had hoped. It was still pretty good. I actually was impressed how close the actors looked to these original characters. There was also a lot of information conveyed in those panels that helped move the story. Some comics can get very wordy and the action tends to suffer, this was not the case at all with this book.<br /><br />For as much as I liked this book I am not sure what more I can say other than read this. If you like the show this is a must read in my opinion. I am looking forward to moving onto book 2 and so on.
1476733953|5.0|I finished Wool a few days ago and I am still thinking about it.  I read dystopian books and of course the norm is for them to be depressing, sad and hopeless.  Don't worry, this book has that too, but there is a lot of hope also.  I did have a little bit of worry about the pace while reading \\"book 2\\".  At times Wool was slow in developing but when all is said and done, this was a fantastic journey.  So excited to read a book with a truly strong female protagonist.  Unlike The Hunger Games (sorry to bring that up), where Katness never reached her potential as a true heroine, in Wool, Jules rocks and there hasn't been a better female character in writing or in movies since Ripley in Alien. There is a line in this book that was a memorable line in the movie Batman Begins.  One of my favorite movie quotes:  It is not who you are but what you do that defines you.  Nice touch.<br />An extra bonus was once I brought the book home and read the author reviews, I was thrilled to see that Ernest Cline chimed in his praise.  Ernest Cline, \\"Ready Player One\\", READ it if you haven't.  It is also a great ride with great characters.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this tv show!!  I rewatch it all the time and love it more every time!!  I can not wait to see what happens in the new season.
0783225903|5.0|Read the one-star reviews and find out this film is too long, the script is too loose, and the love relationship is too unbelieveable. I know all this to be true, but I cannot take my eyes off the film's visuals. This movie is stunning: the sense of freedom in the daydreamed flights, the excitement in the Pythonesque explosions, and the awe at the beauty of Mother's apartment. I loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a good game I enjoy playing it. Just sitting here in hospital and its like really exciting something keeping my interest. Level up
B001BANK32|4.0|Finally I'm finished. It took me longer than I expected but I have this feeling of pride finishing this book. Now by no means does this mean I didn't like the book. This was a great book but not exactly what I expected.<br /><br />Most of King's work that I have read is new to me and I have no knowledge going in so I can form my own versions of the characters and events. This however, was made into a movie and a mini series, both I have seen years before I got around to reading this. Both were also pretty scary when I was a kid and I was really looking forward to being scared out of my mind reading this. Sadly this wasn't the case at all through this whole book. Other books by King such as It, and 'Salem's Lot sent me checking windows at night and made me scared to walk across my house in the middle of the night. The shinning didn't and even though I loved the story, since my expectations were so high, I am sticking to my four star rating. Had it lived up to my expectations and scared the pants off of me, this would have easily been a favorite.<br /><br />Ok, enough of the pet peeve. The reason I liked this book is because the story is so well written and the characters are so interesting. Some of King's lengthier books that have a lot of back story and character development such as The Tommyknockers, have left me bored to tears and wishing something would just happen already. Not the case with the Shining. The characters are so well done I wanted to know every little insignificant detail about them. There was a lot of build up before they even got to the Overlook hotel and were it might have been slow at times, I still found it interesting. Each character had me feeling for them in different situations. Knowing in advance what type of person Jack is, I still felt sorry for him and wished something would change and make the ending I already knew wrong. I wished I could pop into the story and rescue Danny and his mom during some of the more intense parts.<br /><br />I think I have gone on long enough. The short version is I really liked this book. If you are looking for a great story, with amazing characters this is defiantly for you. For those that are not as desensitized to the Macabre as I am, you might find this really scary and I hope you enjoy it. However, if you are like me and have read a lot of King's work and stuff just doesn't scare you as much as it used to, this is still very much worth the read.
0385344228|5.0|It took me a long time to get on this band wagon.  I ran across the mass market paper back and got it.  Defending Jacob is one of the best thrillers I have read.  It isn't just a thriller.  This book delves into deep family issues and the potential for a new science about violence and family genes.  The pace is perfect, and the story line which is complex is believable.  The book flows and is easy to read.  Defending Jacob is like the perfect John Gresham of old with additional dimensions.  I highly recommend.
B00028HBKM|5.0|They did such and amazing job on this show.  It is in the language of the time but you know it all by heart as you watch it and don't really notice.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I got this to see if it was easier to use then the browser and sure enough, it is.  Once I got myself logged in it feels just like I wanted it to.  The check your cart button is my favorite and it is right at the top of the screen so I can see if prices have changed.  I use this on my android and have not had any troubles with it at all, well done app.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The funny,loving ,quirky style of the author is just amazing! I loved it. Can't wait to read the next one!
0425252868|5.0|I would recommend this book to almost anyone. You do not have to be a huge fan of war books. It is a great story about two brave and heroic men. You will not be disappointed if you read this book.
193700788X|1.0|I try not to post negative reviews about books, but that was a truly awful end to that series. Who Sookie ended up with was totally predictable if you read the last book, and rather unbelievable. I did not like how any of the characters stories wrapped up. The writing was at best mediocre (which is par for the course any more with Charlaine Harris), and the story made very little sense. It was a convoluted mess. She made the characters make actions that were inconsistent with what we know. I'm sorry I read it. I won't be buying After Dead.
0553801503|5.0|My boys got me into these with the new show out.  The books go into more detail then the show and the author is wonderful at keeping you into his books from chapter to chapter.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have been watching the episodes in a few days. I find hard to stop and go to sleep. No violence, sex or what made other moovies good but it still incredibly addicted.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|If you cried as much as I did at the end then you truly love this series. You are a dedicated Hunger Games fan and would never doubt its pure awesomeness. If you can feel the emotion and pain and loss, pat yourself on the back because you have a love for emotion moving literature. To sum up this book in one word: exceptional. If you haven't already, purchase this trilogy and you won't regret it. Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be EVER in your favor.
0143120581|3.0|If you like reality TV then you will enjoy this book.  It is intended to provoke and is written with a basic enough vocabulary to reach the much larger mass of Americans looking for a quick read (i.e. entertainment).  Given Chua's other accomplishments, the motivation behind writing the book was what truly captivated me throughout.  If she is to be believed, she was not seeking notoriety, nor did she seem to be lacking in affluence and influence.  As a mother, I can only imagine that despite her many successes, she too reflects and questions the parenting choices that have been made, especially now that they are no longer hers to make.  Right or wrong, it seems sad to me that it has taken so long for her to take a step back to do this kind of reflection.  It wasn't even by choice.  Reflection doesn't need to be as painful or doubting as this book suggests.  Reflection can be a source of great celebration when done regularly and meaningfully.  Instead, what we see is -- albeit edited for effect -- something akin to a runaway train; those huge celebrations being just a part of the chaos.  Reflection, I think, comes quietly from within.  If this book hasn't edited out too much, it seems like Chua only let it happen after she finally ran out of tasks to lay upon her children.  It's unclear what kind of adults the children will grow to become (but Lulu comes across as a sheer genius on the social emotional side of things), so as a fellow parent, my sympathy is largely focused on Chua.  This is one book that I will gladly pass along as one might try to avoid so-called \\"toxic\\" friendships.

You can't really set it up to generate the dollars and kelp while you are living your life so you can easily progress. Since I've now thought more on it I am deleting it right after I finish this review. Go to a beach or aquarium and see the real thing, the Living Seas exhibit is better than this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the detail of this series.  I and love to rewatch this all the time.  I am looking forward to watch the new season when it comes out.
0439023521|5.0|This book will keep you glued to the pages until the end. It is a good read for older teens and adults that like the sci-fi/fantasy genre. I would be worried about letting younger teens read this series - it is pretty violent.
0374214913|3.0|I agree with the other reviewers that Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore was a fun, light read.<br /><br />The book ties together Silicon Valley culture / hypothetical tech companies with an unusual generation-spanning secret society dedicated to an ancient creed. There are a number of interesting characters who work for Google and for another tech startup -- one that creates anatomically correct 3D boobs (yes, for real!)<br /><br />The story is centered on the old San Francisco bookstore of the title... and seemed to promise both a nerdy and bookish adventure.<br /><br />The underpinning of the novel is the coming-of-age of our hero Clay Jannon, and his awkward 21st century attempts at dating, finding the right fit in a high-tech world that moves pretty fast, and understanding how he fits in the world. I liked Clay a lot, and he's quite an appealing character.<br /><br />It's a quick light read, but it's not a thriller. So if you're looking for a techy version of Dan Brown or Umberto Eco, you won't find it here (even though there are indeed monkish characters who wear cloaks and study ancient manuscripts, and a villianous person chasing them.... there's not much of a thrill ride here). It's more a contemporary ennui-ridden story of Clay Jannon coming to adulthood and finding his way in love, the world, and books.<br /><br />For all that, it's a fun read, and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />However, some interesting opportunities for this novel were really left on the floor. And I mention these not because I want to write the book for Robin Sloan, but because these are pretty obvious options for a novel like this... and it would be fun to read a novel that included these things.<br /><br />1) Manuscripts and what they mean: Ancient texts hold the key to the puzzle for this book, but it turns out that all the scanning done by Google doesn't help them understand the point of the story found across many books. Fine, and good. But it turns out that the stories in the books don't actually solve the puzzle at all -- which is hugely disappointing to any true book reader. There are lots of ways that scanning a book doesn't reveal the true meaning of the metaphors. So why not go there?<br /><br />For example, the characters never actually READ any of the books in the story. They are just used a placeholders, as logical puzzle pieces. I reference \\"The Rule of Four\\" for an example of a story that does in fact, have the characters read the books. And what if, as the characters are reading the books, they realize no one else has ever read them.<br /><br />There are lots of real-world possibilities in missing, ancient manuscripts that could be used in a story like this -- but they just weren't used in this story at all. For example, Milton apparently had some missing manuscripts. Another sequel to Paradise Lost? Shakespeare too! What about the rest of Chaucer (his Canterbury Tales are a famous incomplete manuscript). Aristotle apparently wrote dialogues -- all of them missing to this day -- and Plato wrote analytical texts like Aristotle (also missing). Other books from the Bible? What about many ancient authors referenced in the Library of Alexandria index, but unknown in our present day? Why not reveal their books as interesting and connected on a metaphorical level? What if they had word tricks that pointed to each other, and story points (like in 1001 Nights) that reference each other, that a machine could never understand?<br /><br />Robin Sloan doesn't do this.... but I kind of wish he had written this kind of a book. Yeah, I guess I wanted a more modern-day version of Umberto Eco's famous \\"Name of the Rose.\\" (Perhaps I'll write it some day)<br /><br />2) Technology and What it can do: So, they scan manuscripts attempting to discover their meaning, and fail. But what's interesting about this is that scanning a manuscript could -- theoretically -- inject a bit of code into a system that's not designed to accommodate it. Why not have a pseudo-ancient manuscript inject a SQL error into Google, and bring the whole internet down? If you structured it right, this could happen. But this possibility (and many others) that would enable manuscripts to be \\"stronger\\" or more powerful (rather than inert) in their interactions with modern technological institutions were possibilities left on the floor.<br /><br />Furthermore, to train a machine learning -- artificial intelligence -- system, you do a lot of training of the system on other data -- on manuscripts, email, text files and the like. The Enron corpus (all the emails from the Enron legal case) are often used to train systems to recognize patterns. Why didn't we get into machine learning? Google is getting there... exposing some of these technologies in the context of this book would have been fascinating.<br /><br />Anyway, now I'm digressing into the book I would have written.<br /><br />Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is a fine, light read, and a lot of fun. It just could have been much more.... so here's hoping.... someday ;-)cient manuscript inject a SQL error into Google, and bring the whole internet down?

Would recommend anyone who likes to see the series take the time to read these books the author is an amazing writer and keeps you in with each chapter.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|My daughter loved the story and particularly Julie Delpy in this movie and in its sequel, Before Sunset.  She is looking forward to the &#34;final chapter&#34; in &#34;Before Midnight&#34;.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Knew there was every chance I would not like this series' conclusion as Harris had been sowing certain seeds over the past few, largely inadequate, installments. However, I did not anticipate how much Harris would devalue the characters she had spent so long building or illogically unravel and manipulate so many of their relationships. The author had admittedly lost her passion for this fictional world-- I only wish she had concluded the series earlier or had been able to wait until she found that spark again before ending it as Bon Temps and its denizens deserved to go out with far more of a bang (and respect for its readers) than it did.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I think others have commented about the parallels with Robinson Crusoe. I had the same thoughts and thoroughly enjoyed the modern take on the theme. I enjoyed the occasional twist the plot took and particularly enjoyed the fun that the hero poked at himself.  This is a fun science fiction read and I think anyone who appreciates good storytelling would enjoy it too.
B00BIVN82M|1.0|I have to say I was really thrilled about the album. And yet when j first heard it I was saddened deeply. A lot of shallow stuff. His production is becoming so pop, I don't recognize his voice anymore from all the auto tune. He literally sounds about as bad on the album as Tom cruise in rock of ages. And boy was that bad. We all know Michael can sing his ass off.<br /><br />Come at us with less autotune, higher quality songs and mixing and I promise you I will buy 10 copies of that next album.<br /><br />We should really get rid of this album though. It is downright bad. I have no idea who told him, this sounded good.
0553106635|5.0|My boys got me hooked with the new show out.  I am enjoying the extras that the show never has the time to do.  The writer  keeps you in with each chapter he writes and you can not wait to get to the end.

B009AMAGXK|3.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie - 3 / 5<br />video - 3.5 / 5<br />audio - 4 / 5<br /><br />high expectations for this blu ray was dashed with the movie being disappointing as it was, along<br />with terrible video- many soft shots and low definition,and the sound field was poor.<br />a rental at best.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I admittedly saw the movie first and was hooked from the onset (especially by Jennifer Lawrence !!), but the book is even better.  It's a real insight into someone who &#34;snapped&#34; and tries to find their way home using a compass with a firm sense of morality, but not so much of reality.  I highly recommend both the movie and the book - I don't really think you need to read/watch in any particular order, as the movie is true to the book for the most part.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Kind of wished for a better ending, but I know why the author ended it like that. Up to our own individual imaginations
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|the titled I wrote basically summarize what I want to say... The materials are excellent and Boz is an excellent artist with a touch; I dare to say on par with Steely Dan. His records this far are excellent. Listen to his 80s works. Even the Hits! compilation from 90s is still recorded very well. But this album is recorded (or mastered and printed) \\"loud\\" and dynamically compressed. Too bad! music layers are all gone!<br /><br />Come on Boz... You deserve a better quality recording than what has been released here... Some of your serious audience still want to listen your music on quality stereo system. Not just through radio or crappy/leakage earphone. Don't get me wrong, a good sealing earphone/headphone on iPOD could sound really good even if it is on MP3 compressed audio format. But this Memphis recording would still sound bad with that mobile setup.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This movie is a very entertaining movie, and has a fair amount of humor in it as well.  It is not a real slasher film, but that is great as I hate those types of movies.  All in all, if you want a entertaining and humorous movie without all the gore, this fits the bill.

B0015I2P0Y|3.0|If you buy this, chances are it's because of Grounds for Divorce.  Be forewarned it might as well be a single.  The other tracks are monotonous and kinda new age sounding with little pop to them.  It's kind of odd since GFD has a ton of feeling and great music behind it and the rest of the album is such a snooze fest.

1401924751|5.0|Love reading these cards for the younger clients.  Helps to open up a whole new world of possibilities.  I find that the Doreen Virtue books are inclined to stifle ones psychic ability to tune in as readers are inclined to switch it off  and just read what is on the cards, but these cards allow the psychic juices to flow very nicely.
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|My adventure into the world of Harry Potter continues with the Chamber of Secrets. While I enjoyed the film, I didn't think it was as good as the Sorcerer's Stone, as typical of most sequels. In the Chamber of Secrets, we see Harry return for his second year at the Hogwart's School of Wizardery. In year two, students are being attacked, and Dumbledorf knows why. The legendary Chamber of Secrets has been open and a mythological creatures has been released. Harry and his friends have to find out who opened it and why before they are able to do anything about it. This story wasn't as mysterious or edge of your seat as the last adventure was, and I found some parts of it to be downright childish. What I enjoyed about the first film was that for all it has for kids, it had an equal amount of content that adults would enjoy. In the Chamber of Secrets, that element has been replaced with things like giant talking spiders, flying cars, and worst of all Dobby the troll. The story was pretty good, but it wasn't as refreshing as the last film, the cast was once again terrific, but the Chamber of Secrets seemed to be much more like a kids movie to me and for that reason was kind of a disappointment.

B001974DG0|5.0|Over the years there have been a few novels I read again and again:  King's \\"The Stand,\\" Heinlein's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" and two of Koontz':  \\"Strangers,\\" and Watchers.\\"<br /><br />This wondrous book looks at what it means to be \\"human,\\" and shows that more often than not, \\"humanity\\" wins out against Corporate and Governmental greed.<br /><br />So as not to spoil any part of this great adventure, I will say only this:  If you can't buy it, try to borrow it. The very first chapter will have you wanting to read more about a loner who runs into a dog in the forest. .... and no one will ever be the same.<br /><br /> Not the characters in the book, nor the countless readers who, like me, come back to read about governmental secret experiments, a shy woman, an ex-Delta man, and the joys and horrors that they encounter.<br /><br />Friends, not masters.  Thank you, fur face.
B000067IZ3|4.0|Excellent movie about drug lords and cartels and drugs. Del Toro still has his Puerto Rican accent but he does a decent job in playing a Tijuana cop. He tries really hard to imitate Northern Mexican accent but I can still tell he is not from Mexico. Nevertheless, this movie reminds me of Amores Perros. Four stories blending together nicely. The movie is in English with optional Spanish, French, and English subtitles. One of the stories, however, the one where Del Toro is involved, is just in Spanish but you can watch it with English subtitles if needed. It had to be done this way to keep the whole plot connected. The other three stories are in English. In one of the stories, the one that takes place in Tijuana, the lighting is not so good. Maybe they did this to capture the real atmosphere. To make the viewer feel like they were actually there. They do a good job in showing how people live at the border. Very good cast. Thumbs up!

0307476464|5.0|In 1Q84, Haruki Murakami has proved that a modern writer can tell a story with the best of any era or culture. Heaping superlatives on this book may make me sound like a shill. Too bad. Murakami has written the best fiction I have read in years.<br /><br />Within the first few chapters, the reader has enough information to know much about the plot and can make a fair guess how it will end. The only thing to keep the reader's attention is the author's craft. The details are all that matters for the 1157 pages in this edition.<br /><br />In the first chapter, it is Spring of 1984. We are introduced to Aomame our female protagonist. She will fall down a rabbit hole, technically climb down into it, and emerge in in what she will come to call 1Q84. In case you think this will be a children's story, she will have a mildly erotic memory as she descends. We have already been warned that \\"not everything is as it seems.\\" Aomame is not as she seems.<br /><br />In the next chapter we will meet the male protagonist, Tengo. He is very much who he seems. However it will be his task to secretly ghost write a book. That is he will produce a major plot device that is not all that it seems.<br /><br />The structure of 1Q84 is alternating chapters about these two people. We will quickly learn of the long ago connection between them. Given this structure and this information it does not take a very alert reader to understand that these two will find each other. By chapter four we know the outcome and have ample information to guess at the broad outline of the plot. The only question is: can the writing keep us involved?<br /><br />Early in the book and continuing throughout we will be fed global cultural references. The most common being:<br />American jazz and blue jeans<br />Eastern European Classical music<br />Central European Philosophy and psychology<br />One German made pistol<br />French and British literature<br />Liquor and tobacco from several non-Japanese origins<br /><br />The heart of the story is Japanese. The storyline is based in magical reality. We are asked to consider forces beyond good and evil. There are spirits, portents and ghosts. Among these forces it is never clear who is good or bad. The ultimate power seems to reside in maintaining balance. Even this word is left ambiguous.  Forces are in opposition, but too much power on the one side causes something to happen that empowers the other. Over all this love is triumphant and we are reminded that there is a God.<br />All of these themes are consistent with Japanese story telling. I have seen these same vague spirits in early Japanese movies and in modern Japanese Anime.<br /><br />Ultimately what sets 1Q84 above the various traditions and the predictable ending are the skills of the story teller. Murakami style is deceptively simple. Where you are given facts, they are rarely embellished or intricate. If you are not to be given facts, it is made clear that you are not intended to have an explanation.  Some things are never fully explained. Pay attention. Characters will usually tell you pages in advance, what new disclosure is coming or what will never be explained.<br />Murakami is also a master of pacing. Much of the early chapters are introductory, events proceed slowly. The middle third will see an increase in the action and increased tensions.  The ending will occasionally lag then leap forward. All of this is deliberate. All of this is applied story telling.<br /><br />1Q84 can be read in relatively short bursts. There may be readers who could not put it down. I was not one. But, when I was not reading it, I was thinking about it. As certain as I was of the outcome I was worried about both the main characters and many of the second and third tier characters. Most of these characters at some point will engage your sympathies. No one is entirely good or evil.<br /><br />One can argue that great writers like Tolstoy wrote long novels, but they also handled large issues:war, crime, politics, and the depths of the human soul.  1Q84 is mostly about its characters. The major themes include the power of love and of believing. The discussion of being beyond good and evil will be the starting point for many advanced academic papers. What I most enjoyed, what I most happily road in was the craft of Haruki Murakami.war, crime, politics, and the depths of the human soul.  1Q84 is mostly about its characters.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game. Very addicting. Colorful, fun, not a complicated game, great cure for boredom. Trust me I know. I'll keep this game for sure ;)
B0095VPBM2|3.0|Should have went with the quad core. probably good enough for Plex media server for Roku players around the house.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I couldn't stop reading. I'm late to the party and have only heard many positive things in the small Oklahoma community, but I finally bit the bullet and read the book. Believe me, I'm glad I did.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Wonderful tome that all should read and take to heart. I don;'t know why it took so long to open it.
B004UHL9EK|3.0|This is the HTC Evo equivalent for alarms. But there are advertisements in it. Unhappy with that. Also the countdown function failed to alert me.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I am half way through it, I don't think the characters were described well enough.  Half way though it is getting more interesting
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|If you like race car games this is the one game you only need.My kids got me hooked! I play it every day now
B000067QMD|5.0|These are a must have if you use Avent bottles. They are great for storing breast milk in the fridge or freezer. They're also good for on the go.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it has great features but I would like it to have the things that PC has like minecraft and endermen.
B009R659L8|4.0|I have read all of Mary Higgins books and loved them all including this one/ She is one of my favorite authors.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Took me many months to read a little at a time, however a good tale. I'd recommend it to all!
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I read the book first and was so excited when the movie came out.  I think the actors were cast perfectly, and while it follows the book well, it just cannot do the book justice.  I think this may be one of the best casted movies I have seen in a long time, which makes me want to watch it again and again.  Any movie that can make you laugh and cry is a winner in my eyes!
B00164GDD2|5.0|A really good movie, Bill murray is allways funny. Laughed all the way thru it. Strongly recomend seeing this one.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is very comfortable to use and with the many ways it can be customized it makes a great gaming mouse.
B000SVZIDA|4.0|I rented this movie for a day, and I'm very happy that I was able to show it to my friend for so cheap.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|I bought this dvd because I love Natalie Portman, and I believe this movie is from the same director as &#34;The Fountain&#34; which is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time.  I enjoy watching this movie, although some of the psychological transformations get a little gross after a while.  However, I find this film to be engaging, beautiful, dark, and Natalie never disappoints.
B004HY3BTC|5.0|STILL REALING FROM THIS ONE. I WOULD LOVE TO OWN JOHNNY 5.  HE IS SO REAL YOU WOULD THINK HE WAS.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I learned a lot about Tesla. The ending was very strong and as one who works with my own creative projects it left me with a lot to think about.<br /><br />Justin Cohen<br />[...]
B002PMV9FG|4.0|While I'm glad that we found the DVD for a good price, I wasn't thrilled that it doesn't include any special features. So sad it's not offered.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is one of those movies that are just so simplistically beautiful because of the love story, and I think Emily Blunt is fantastic as Victoria.  I could, and do, watch this one again and again, especially while doing my crafting.  The costumes are gorgeous.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I'm not sure what this has to do with order and chaos but... One day a boy named Billy was playing with barbies when all of a sudden 3 heros named Kagax, Rockfist, and Angel came into his town and wreaked havoc and killed him. The end.
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|U should be able to control speed and there should also be a way to make a PDF from the app itself
B006JPS1OM|2.0|I would love to give a higher rating if I could get pass chapter 2. This game has a serious bug. If you stop to save it will not let play again you have to reload and start over.  I bought the full version wonder if I can get a refund. Sorry no more G5 games for me.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|The game is free and looks pretty cool and at only 14MB, not bad BUT then u open it and it tells u that u need an additional 580MB of storage just to play the freaking thing! I got this for my son but he was never able to play it because of the extra download. I deleted it......wish I had read more of the reviews......
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I really enjoy this app, because I wanted to learn how to play songs without worrying about reading music. Also, it's nice to be able to be creative with the options they give you. The controls are easy to understand.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|I was very pleased with the condition that the discs were in, and they're just awesome movies regardless of what the critics may have said.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is superb, my favorite writer by far.  As always, a wonderful ending you don't see coming.  I can't wait for her next book.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is the first book that I have read by this author, but it won't be my last. The story is comical and one that I really enjoyed. I look forward to reading more work by this author.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is a little harder to play and can be a little harder to keep from getting confused due to space.  However, it is a decent game.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|WOW!!!!!! &#34;SOMEONE REALLY HAS TO TELL US WHERE OUR FOOD COMES FROM!&#34;<br />BRAVO TO THE CREATERS OF THIS DOCUMENTARY. THEY WILL HARVEST AND PROLONG MANY LIVES.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|If you love film, you have to see this movie. So original, but what Christopher Nolan does best as well as in Insomnia, is immerse you in the main character.
B003XDXNOQ|5.0|Love these shoes. Great for work now that its warmer out, since I have to wear closed toe shoes that will stay on if I have to run to a code.  Plus my feet tend to get hot in slip on shoes, and these are very breatheable.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I teach various science courses at a couple of Universities and use episodes of Star Trek to help spark student interest.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book.  Great connections and all the characters were well developed.  A feel good book. Highly recommended.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|this bingo was not what I expected and I really don't care about playing it on my kindle would not recommend to others.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Enjoyable working your way up through the levels. Myself and daughters enjoyed the game. Works for various ages. Hours of fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|GET THIS GAME. It is worth the $7so get it,just make sure you don't get addicted to it. One of the best games ever !!!!! SamJ
B009NY43NY|1.0|The series has gone downhill for the last 4 books. These last two have been down right painful to read.<br />I understand that no author will please every fan, especially ones from such a long series. I held no expectations nor was  feeling very particular over who Sookie should end up with. So my disappointment isn't from some personal notion as to the who, what, or why.<br />There is a very real sense that this final instalment was purely a contractual fulfilment and not a labour of love.
0439023521|5.0|I daughter was reading these books and this one was checked out of the library and she was waiting then the person rechecked it out she was so upset I ordered it for her and it was faster than the lady who rechecked it out and my daughter had it read before it was brought back.
193700788X|1.0|I'm glad I borrowed this off someone else and didn't spend any money.  Complete crap.  There are about 70+ other reviews that perfectly sum up the book and let you know just how bad it is, so I'll save a wordy right-up.  Save yourself money, time, and disappointment: read the reviews and get the general idea, and then make up your own ending.<br /><br />So. Bad.
B009NY43NY|5.0|A great book but sad to see the series end!  Very exciting and suspenseful.  Wrapped up a lot of loose ends.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game.  I play it whenever I get the chance.  Even when I am at work I find time to play.  I would like to advance beyond level 7.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I was charged for the product but never was able to download it onto my kindle. Said it was downloaded but nada.
193700788X|3.0|This book has been released for approximately 6 hours and yet there are 13 scathing customer reviews already. Couldn't possibly have read the entire book yet. Did we get advanced copies? Did we skip to the end, see who Sookie paired off with, get angry it wasn't the one we wanted?<br /> Buy the book (or don't) but make your own decision. (I've given the book 3 stars without even having had a chance to READ it yet. I know I am going to enjoy it SOMEWHAT because it's a SOOKIE book.)
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is a single player or multi player version of the game salitaire you have a choice of backgrounds and card styles. Winning draw or random.
B0011BGY66|4.0|great debut album that has some great songs with interwoven textures not heard in a while...they hit their stride on the next one but this was a great start....
B009NY43NY|1.0|I think the title of my review says it all... I wish I had taken my own advice from my review of the previous book when I said it would be better to skip the last book and imagine our own HEA for Sookie... The entire story was forced with rushed cameos from everyone we could think of from previous books...all of the loose ends sloppily tied up and all of our favorites not even resembling themselves so they could fit the mold for train wreck of a book...<br /><br />I was not overly concerned with the \\"who\\" that Sookie would choose but it makes me sad that Sookie cannot just have simple friend that is a male that doesn't want more from her...What a pathetically sad ending for Sookie....talk about jumping the Shark.....
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This is not the most user-friendly application I've ever encountered. Still, the staff at Mobisystems has been patient and offered excellent support. Even if you're not super savy when it comes to tech stuff, this app is worth the investment.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|It honestly took a little while for me to get in to the book, but it grew on me and I couldn't put it down! Very thought provoking.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|cant get off of this game for hours it takes my mind in all directions but in a good way:)
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I questioned why I was even watching the movie, but then it came along quite nicely.  I don't want to give too much away, but there's suspense, mystery, and action.  If you enjoyed Tom Cruise in the Mission Impossible movies, you should enjoy this.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Its great to read the story of a humble warrior, factual and selfless in his writing style.<br />Not gung-ho but insightful without ego and done for support of fellows veterans and theirs family's.<br />If you want to know the real story and the truth then this is a must read.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|At first I could not download it because I had used up too much application. space. then I was able to get ready for school on time!:)
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I can't believe what I have just read....what a let down to readers....it sucked I was not impressed ....what a let down.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|It really could have been, should have been five stars.  I watched this twice, and usually I don't do that, especially not within weeks of the first viewing, but the violence was a bit much, but that is QT.  I think it should have been made for younger audiences to enjoy because the overall message of the movie was damn good!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  I had to turn my head away from the boxing scenes and dogs tearing a person limb from limb, literally.  (How did Quentin Tarintino do that?  Did he get a body from the morgue?).  Other than that, I enjoyed the German fairytale of Bromhilde.  I enjoyed Jamie Foxx and Leonardo di Caprio.  This movie was Jamie Foxx's best performance!  And Leonardo's best performance as well. (I never would have guessed he had a bad guy in him.)<br /><br />The story line is about the freeing and empowering of someone who was a slave during the time of slavery - very thought provoking and an innovative story line.  I've never come across anything like that before, not Roots, not Queen, not any movie or TV series.  Also, this is a story of friendship, loyalty, and love.  You have to see this movie for yourself.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great read... Very sad but has a happy ( if you can consider it all happy) ending! A must read for anyone who cares about others! Marcus is a true hero, someone our children should look up to!
B004T6IBNY|1.0|This game freezes constantly on my kindle fire HD 8.5.Flippers stop working, ball drops,game ends no matter how many balls I have left. Under options menu there is an option .with nothing but question marks. Hitting this gives a nice HD table that fits entirely on the screen, but freezes also.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am a teenager and I will say this is one of the best, if not THE best, book I have ever read.  In school they give us books to read that has no emotion or a deeper level of thought put into it.  I only wish that these are the kind of novels we are required to read.  I will definitely be reading this book again.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great storyline and amazing graphics.  Hoping for more games like this.  Variety of puzzles (not just hidden objects)  keeps it interesting.  Looking forward to sequel
B005D9MUWY|5.0|been using this keyboard for a few years now. its great. learns very quickly and adjusts to your usual language pretty easily. i prefer this over others.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Money well spent, fun and edge of your seat excitement!!<br />The necroa virus and neurax worm make the game more of a challenge I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT TWO MUTATIONS!!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I recommend to all ages. Seriously don't like ready but, this book just caught my eye. This book is amazing, terrific,great, Funny, and out of this world! I'm 13 & I believe any age can read this (except the part where the chapters say 'only for adults') ANYWAYS if you have enough time to read my comment, you'll have enough time to read Ellen's hilarious book! (: #ellenfanforlife <3
B00932A4XE|3.0|My wife and I liked it. It was funny. It's not really based on the book that much from what I understand (although admittedly I've never read the book). It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but if I had cable (which I don't), and nothing else was on, I would watch it for a while. I usually reserve my 3 stars for movies I barely liked over not liking it, if that makes any sense. But I wouldn't say this was 4-star quality either. It's a chick-flick and women who have been pregnant would probably enjoy it more than I did. Yep, that pretty much sums it up.
B002GHHHL0|4.0|Another 'watch what you do when you play around with nature' film. Nonetheless, it had sufficient individuality to be entertaining, unless you have seen a very, very good fish story recently.  Big surprise was the adventures of the Big Honcho who paid for the whole thing. Beyond that I cannot say. The acting in all cases was consistent with the demands and possibilities written into the role; only the comic relief was both unnecessary and way, way too anciently stereotypical for an opponent of political correctness to take with ease.<br />All-in-all, then, I do not think missing the film would create a lacunae in your cultural  experience which you will  regret.  On the other hand, if you do not feel like coping with high drama or perplexing human problems, if you just want a bit of escape from reality, this  should be an acceptable means to achieve what you want for 15 minutes less than a couple of hours.<br />I would try to view it, though, for the minimum cash outlay.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|In full disclosure, I was probably drawn to this book simply due to Emma Watson playing a role in the film.  I rarely watch a movie before reading the book, so I decided to download “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” to my Kindle.  I suppose it is a decent coming of age read, but not at all like my experience.  The book is dark; at times even a little disturbing, to the point of being a little troubling.  My rating is based on it being “just okay” although I have now decided to skip the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so addictive! My entire family loves Temple Run. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys thrills.
1451668945|5.0|Mary is a phenomenal story teller and this book is a suspenseful story! I loved it and wish I could read another as good!!
B004L35GAQ|4.0|I'm a late-arriver to the fanbase for AWOLnation. But wow, this album is just excellent.  They have some great heavy songs, and also some chill ones. Can't get over the 15-min track, Knights of Shame... best \\"driving along in the car\\" song I've jammed to in a long time!<br /><br />Now, for frontman Aaron Bruno and the rest of AWOL to get onto a 2nd album... but till then, everyone be sure to get THIS one! :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great graphics and the challenges keep you going. You complete one challenge and you have another to do. You never fully beat the game.
0670014893|4.0|I read this book in little more than a day. I found it much more compelling than Le Carre's last - OUR KIND OF TRAITOR - and think it marks a return to form for him; this is probably his best book since THE CONSTANT GARDENER.  Although his politics have never been shriller or more heavy-handed, and some of the caricatures here (particularly of the Americans) are just embarrassing, this is such a superb piece of storytelling that one can almost overlook its faults. Rather than regurgitate the book's plot, I'll just say that the writing here has tremendous assurance - from the very beginning you feel in the hands of a master - and the main characters are superbly-drawn. I think Le Carre buffs will get a lot of enjoyment out of this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a way fun game!! You can okay against Facebook friends and get to the top of the leader board! It's way fun and I recommend it to anyone who likes Temple Run. It's like that!!
0345472322|5.0|As a parent of 3 young kids, I've been more concerned with their results (grades, athletic achievements, etc.) than with the effort they put forth.  Dweck's book proved to me that I've got this wrong.  Getting good grades without having to work for those grades isn't benefiting my kids in the long term.  Focusing on effort (or the \\"growth mindset,\\" as it's referred to by Dweck) is paramount to their long term success.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and looking out for more.  Hope you flesh out the relationships some more.  Again it was a great read.
B003ES61EE|3.0|Yep. I hang my head in shame. I'd ranted against this lens cleaner for the itsy-bitsy 5mm on a side semi-triangular cleaning head I found when I popped off the top. At the end of the review, I hypothesized that maybe it was intended for cell phone cameras. It probably is. However, if you wriggle that teensy thing out, you'll spot a more reasonably sized cleaning head ready to take on your other lens cleaning needs.<br />I ooopsed. Here's the updated review: It's not awful. The cleaning pad on the REVERSIBLE head doesn't quite mate perfectly to the mount on which it sits on this particular incarnation of the product, so there's the possibility of rubbing unfelted plastic against my lens. YMMV, as your piece may be perfectly made, or come from a shift with better QC. The plasto-rubber material is much stiffer than in my previous and dearly departed non-branded generic LensPen, so the risk of scratches from this off-centered rubbo-plasticine material increase with pressure applied. The felt, off-center as it is, is also thinner than in that previous precious product, and therefore carries less of the good*stuff*Carbon*Black cleaner-upper dust. So even with the larger head and bonus reversibility, this tool gets a meager three stars.<br />Ah well.
0062082353|5.0|After purchasing the book it was delivered very quickly.<br /><br />Quickly began reading and could not put it down read the whole book in 5 days.<br /><br />Great action, Love, Tense battle moments, Great Detail, Laughter, all mixed up in one book.<br /><br />Purchase read and leave on your shelf for the little ones to read years later.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|This was the most awesome series ever on TV.  I am sorry it is over.  I have purchased all seasons and could watch them over and over again.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I dont know how i got along without this bag!!<br />Nice size and plenty of space for all my photo needs!!!!!!<br />LOVE IT!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|So good can't wait for the movie.<br />The movie will go good with the book. I will read it again before the movie comes out.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Nothing else I have ever used comes close to marching SwiftKey's predictive text capabilities. The themes offered are decent and attractive but it's the keyboard itself that is the best feature.
B005DOKM9M|1.0|I ordered this for my brand new Kindle fire HD 7 inch, it is to small to zip it up with the kindle inside I am so bumbed
B00992CF6W|5.0|My only complaint for this game is that I wish I could Chang my skin. And Mojang, if you need ideas: my you could skin packs based of subjects. For example: medieval pack, avengers pack, and video game pack. And all of those packs could be $.99. Also you could have a skin creator that is $4.00.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I cannot believe that despite having so many great actors, this movie is so insanely boring.  In my opinion, literally nothing happens this whole movie.  Why this was made I have zero idea, and quite frankly I want my money back.  I've never thought that before.<br /><br />This movie is not worth even watching the trailer.  Boring, boring, boring.  I wish I could just repeat that phrase to infinity without being more bored than I was watching this.<br /><br />Also, it's a complete let down that anything will even come from the ending.  Whomever is rating this movie at 5 stars needs to seriously reexamine their lives.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Sometimes the apps doesn't open and I don't think it's because of my device because every time I tap it it say apps is not responding
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever!  It's ssssooooo awesome! Update made it even better! Everyone should have it on their tablet.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Love her and she is amazing, but it was a little high in price. I do not understand why we have to write so many words!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow!!  This book was a true ride!!  The first half of it was good but the second half really took off!  The marriage of Nick and Amy was a little, no alot, SCARY!!  Goes to show that it's possible for a person to be married for a number of years and still not know their spouse.  I was totally surprised by the ending but I don't want to give any spoilers away!  You just NEED TO READ THIS BOOK!!  Best one I have read this year!!  Highly recommend!!  :o))
0316044695|5.0|In all my years of reading, I cannot remember the last time I picked up a book and reached a point at which every other activity, or priority, became second to continued reading.  That was certainly my experience reading this book, that is like carefully pulling back the sting on a bow.  The book starts out with a great overview of how becoming a Seal transforms the person.  But then, like releasing that bow string- the reader is quickly catapulted into a truly remarkable story of endurance, commitment, FAITH, and physical will.  I must admit, I did not see the focus on faith coming, but I was inspired and made much more attuned to my own faith through this remarkable story.  God bless those who serve, and endure the sacrifices such as those described here.  I have probably given away 7-8 copies, often to complete strangers with whom I become acquainted on airplanes, or in my business interactions.  I do not have the words to adequately describe how much I recommend this book.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Shrine of New Generation Slaves is truly an awesome effort from Riverside and it is their best album yet.<br /><br />Flowing - This is one of those albums that you never get bored with. The structures are interesting with an underlying mood that pervades the entire disc. It is 50 minutes of music that flows well from one song to the next. Floyd-like at times as in the song Escalator Shrine, Porcupine Tree-ish at other moments, the musical ideas here fit together so well into a cohesive whole. And despite the obvious influences, the result is distinctly Riverside.<br /><br />Melodic - The vocals are very good, especially on The Depth of Self-Delusion and We Got Used to Us where Mariusz Duda contributes a certain nuance to the choruses that add emotional depth to the songs. The guitar work throughout is tasteful and melodic, yet dynamic in the exploration of ideas.<br /><br />Relevant - The lyrical ideas are certainly relevant to the modern age in which we live. If you are looking for current prog rock at it's finest, this is it. And then, there is the song Celebrity Touch, which has an appeal across genres in the vein of a more straight up rock tune. This is music that matters. I find that if I'm looking for something to impress and to introduce friends to really awesome music, then I'm reaching for Shrine of New Generation Slaves.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Love her and she is amazing, but it was a little high in price.  I do not understand why we have to write so many words!!!
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I expected something more.  So many people had told me how wonderful the Broadway show was.  I guess the movie just didn't come up to the quality of the live show.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Just putting a rating here to get the stupid chest thingy. the rest is filler blah blah blah blah xfg cdry gjiut feyjjb xsrrw
0345528581|3.0|I think that this book would have been better to be a DVD. Its a very helpful book even though.
1476735115|5.0|With little to go on I chose this book because Amazon recommended it. As a long time SciFi reader/buyer I figured they had a pretty good idea what I liked. For a first time author or a veteran for that matter, he knew what strings to pull. I thought I had read every type of plot, but with his character development, this seemed new. Actually I can't remember a story line quite like this. Highly recommended. I have never reviewed anything before, but thought this was worth the trouble. Hope he writes more soon.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This book was an amazing story. It's nice to have read a book from the point of view of an outsider witnessing the tragic events of the holocaust.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|GREAT GAME. Sound effects and movement is FANTASTIC. Keep the reality coming and keep the perks for players.<br /><br />Interesting, entertaining for all ages
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|but this game is just another wallet miner...teaching kids to spend, spend, spend their parents hard earned money.  At one point you are required to grow these &quot;mystery&quot; plants that take all of two days to grow and once you've spent the money on them, no credit is given...complete rip-off.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|While I'm not a Selene Gomez fan, our whole family enjoyed this film. Funny and cute and very understandable for all generations.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie...especially loved the ending. Good movie for an avid horror movie fan...quite a few scenes that will scare the crap outta ya too!!! I especially liked the fact that there wasn't much cussing and absolutely no nudity or sexual situations...which is really hard to find in any movies nowadays but particularly horror movies!!
B00BIPMGD0|4.0|An excellent series. It is about a strong, dignified woman who holds it together under the microscope of public scrutiny.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I actually fall asleep so much faster while listening to cat purring.IT is one of the most relaxing sounds .My granddaughter also listens to it also
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The game is easy, fun, and informative. Graphics are really good too. I would recommend to anyone who just wants to kill some time on their hands.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got hooked on this and watched all three seasons in a matter of a short two weeks.  I kept wanting to see what happens next so I lost a lot of sleep because of it but it was well worth it.  I cannot wait until Season 4 comes out!!!!!!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|So I just got a chance to use this today and here are my first impressions as a gamer and constant computer user ...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Good value for the price<br /><br />- A bit on the light side (with the weights in), .. I like it, but you might not if you prefer a very heavy mouse.<br /><br />- Fits ok if you are palm grip user<br /><br />- It has a good feel to it.<br /><br />- It slides smoothly on my hard alienware mouse pad.<br /><br />- Tracking is just fine (considering my mouse pad)<br /><br />- I havent encountered a problem with accidentally hitting the side buttons (I am a palm grip user), so the front and back buttons have good arrangement for me, had problem with middle button but I got used to it after couple of uses and now i can safely say the side buttons are effective and nicely arranged.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The scroll wheel really feels cheap! I mean really cheap, .. I have a 7 dollars mouse that have a nicer scroll wheel with teeth, I wouldn't have minded if they removed the LED light from the scroll and put a better quality scroll wheel, light is gimmick, scroll wheel is useful! make it better!!!<br /><br />- This might be a bit subjective, but its big! I mean I do not know why i imagined it to be smaller from the pictures but its definitely not on the small side, and I have small to medium hands, having some trouble adjusting to it, so if you have small hands, be ware!<br /><br />- The left side isnt perfectly ergonomic as you would think, my thumb (which is rather thin) doesn't really fit comfortably on the rubbery side, maybe if they extended the lower wing it would have been way more comfortable, .. but anyway I definitely could see a problem here if you have thick thumb finger.<br /><br />- The weight compartment cover isnt easy to open! I twisted in the correct direction, .. tried to slide it but couldnt (I do not have finger nails I bite em!!) I had to bring a pin and insert it in the crack and open it up, the mechanism couldhave been better.<br /><br />- I felt the weights to be rather useless, .. I do not know how much exactly to they add, .. but I definitely couldn't tell a huge difference between having weights and not having weights.<br /><br />- The weight compartment have open ways to the internals of the mouse!! if you accidently dropped a weight piece in the wrong position it might go inside the mouse itself, why did they leave those spaces is beyond me.<br /><br />- The Macro record function button only records mouse clicks? (Explained in the updated product manual)<br /><br />- When in Macro manager and trying to record a macro, it only records from keyboard? (Explained in the updated product manual)<br /><br />- Anker software's font is small, I have 9200x1200 res and I have to squint my eyes to see whats written, no way of increasing the font from Anker Software.<br /><br />Things that are just .. meh<br />- No CD, .. I actually like that, probably only few people are going to use it anyway, and everyone would like to be on the latest software and hardware drivers, so its truly a waste, not having it will save cost and result in a better price for the consumer, so Anker, yes for this, NO CD! its a waste.<br /><br />- LED lights, .. sure its nice if you have a near perfection gaming mouse, .. but I think they should have moved the cost allocation to areas that require more attention and more value to the gamer (e.g. better scroll wheel)<br /><br />- The weight case is plastic that looks like steel, .. its ok, I mean you arent going to play with it, and if it saves costs and reduces the price for the consumer, sure why not, keep them plastic.<br /><br />- Braided cable, .. a nice touch.<br /><br />- Gold plated port: Useless gimmick.<br /><br />- I wish that all the mouse had this nice matte-like finish on it, but instead the right side of the mouse is covered with glossy plastic, that is not that nice to feel like the matte-like finish covering the center of the mouse whereyour palm rests, but this is just meh.<br /><br />... and thats it for now, I will update the review if I found something worth mentioning<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br />Update: 08-May-2013<br /><br />Ok I used the mouse for a long period of time playing skyrim, and the side buttons are fine! I got used to the middle button that I had problem with earlier, so now I can safely say the three side buttons can be used effectively and comfortably after you get used to it, so I am removing this from the cons.<br /><br />I have to add a con though, the font of the software is pretty small, I have 19200x1200 screen, and I have to squint my eyes and come near the screen to see whats written (My eye sight is just fine, I dont need glasses :P .. but the font is really small on big res screens)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br />Update: 13-May-2013<br /><br />I have received an email from Sunnie, an Anker customer support rep a couple of days ago, I was a bit surprised because most companies I have dealt with have pretty much \\"Sale and Forget\\" policy unless you actively chase them if there was a problem.<br /><br />The email from Anker was regarding my experience with the mouse and about my review here in Amazon, he (or she, .. sorry I am bad with foreign names) told me about the updated manual where it explains in details how the macro function works, which is what I was confused about in my initial review, ... the limitation is still there but now at least I am clear about it as it is mentioned clearly in the manual that the Macro record and play buttons work with Mouse clicks only, and within the Anker software it works with the keyboard keys only, so there is no way you can record mixed keyboard + mouse clicks.<br /><br />We discussed the cover of the weight compartment as well, and how its a bit difficult to open, he said they are having a video tutorial on how to open it, which should come handy for new buyers.<br /><br />At last, he asked if there is anything they can do to make me satisfied, and they delivered.<br /><br />So anyway, all in all, Anker customer care is top notch, they have an excellent and active customer service, the product is above average and they are willing to listen to their customers to improve.<br /><br />Within 2 years period, I can easily see them competing with Corsair, Logitech and even rival the overrated Razor gaming products (if they kept improving their product, kept the price reasonable and kept their excellent customer service)<br /><br />I am increasing my rating by one star, purely based on Anker's excellent customer service.<br /><br />Cheers to the guys and gals at Anker, keep up the good work.

193700788X|1.0|I enjoyed the first several Sookie books so much, they were clever, witty, imaginative and real page turners.  The last several books have gone so downhill I'm amazed at two things - first that they are actually published and second that I bought them!  I detested the titles \\"Elsewhere\\"  are you kidding me?  You can't even be bothered to think of a location?  Tall man, middle man, round man - this read like a 6th grade composition by a bored student.  I agree with many other reviews - characters are not even recognizable, writing flat, boring story.  I am confused at the author protesting that it's \\"her\\" story and she'll write it as she will - well that's fine - if she would actually write something.  I too agree she sold out for money.  I think True Blood diluted that charm of the earlier books and I will never buy another book by this author.  She needs to realize people/fans DO get upset when they pay $15 or more for lousy work. Do not recommend to anyone.

0385334176|4.0|All right, so at this point, I've read 4 books by Kurt Vonnegut.  I have to say, I'm disappointed with Deadeye Dick -- wait, no, put down that crowbar and hear me out!  I'm disappointed with this book because it didn't meet my expectations for Vonnegut's work.  So far, I've read \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" and \\"Galapagos\\", and these books are just out-and-out fantastic.  Deadeye Dick though, feels like a minor work.  There's not a super strong throughline, but it's humorous enough.  I don't want to comment too much on the plot because I feel like some of the reveals here should be left to the discovery of the reader.  Suffice to say, the book doesn't follow a conventional plot as much as it meanders along with the titular character.<br /><br />Deadeye Dick is chock-full of good ideas, and in Vonnegut fashion, that kind of fly into view and take off into the distance within a few pages.  The author gives the reader a list of the explanations of the symbols in the book (at the beginning on the novel too).  This explanation of symbols is both good and bad.  I thought it was fascinating to read what Vonnegut intended, and seeing this list kind of gives the readers a glimpse into the process of writing Deadeye Dick.  However, it also highlights some of the missed opportunities of the novel.  The symbols here (I don't want to give any of them away in case you would like to skip this part of the book and discover it for yourself) aren't fleshed out all that well in the book.  I would even say (with the exception of a few symbols), most readers wouldn't pick up on a lot of these metaphors and allusions because we never really spend enough time with them.<br /><br />And this leads me to what I disliked most about Deadeye Dick: it's just too short.  Sure, Vonnegut is known for his quick prose -- many of his novels fly by at blazing speeds -- but this book feels disjointed.  Don't get me wrong, I really loved some of the experimental flares here: the recipes inserted into random passages, the meandering musings of the main character, the play-like dialog scenes.  However, it just feels like there's not enough substance here to make a great novel.  The audience is given hundreds of glimpses, but these glimpses never really last long enough (for me at least) to gain any powerful feelings.<br /><br />If you like Kurt Vonnegut's work, you'll probably like Deadeye Dick -- it contains all of the author's hallmarks.  However, if you haven't liked what you've read of his so far, this novel won't be the one to convince you otherwise.d into random passages, the meandering musings of the main character, the play-like dialog scenes.

B005LAIHYU|4.0|Interesting fictional twist to the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln and Vampire historicity.  Who would have thought that &#34;honest Abe&#34; could have single handedly saved the world from the scourge of Vampirism and brought an end to their evil Southern Confederate plan to use slaves as a main source of &#34;food&#34;.  Having had three great great uncles who fought on the side of the Confederate forces in the Civil War, I was mildly offended by the story line portraying the confederate soldiers as vampires.  I know...just chalk it up to the creative license of the writers.  &#34;Tongue in Cheek&#34; best summarizes the story line. Vampire addicts will enjoy it.

B003R0MF1W|5.0|We have been watching this series since the beginning and it continues to be one of our favorite television series.  The major characters have chemistry which makes the viewer care about them and what happens to them.  The stories continue to follow the main theme of finding the serial killer &#34;Red John&#34;, the arch villain responsible for murdering Patrick Jane's wife and young daughter, while adding in side stories.  I personally love Patrick's use of hypnosis to draw out the truth from individuals involved in the episodic cases.

Every character is \\"out of character\\" and does not do the previous books justice.<br /><br />1/ you have a 1000 year old viking vampire who loves war and brawl amazingly turn into a queens puppet.<br />2/ sookie settles for whatever she can get. which happens to be sam<br />3/ eric may as well not have been in the book at all. Their marriage severed by the same ceremonial knife and she just walks out.<br />4/ bill has a few fleeting appearances kind of like the neighbour who asks for sugar and a chit chat<br />5/ the murder plot was predictable.<br /><br />Spoilers are good for you so you don't waste any money.

B008602KQI|1.0|Yo, it's like a Running Man/Battle Royal Mash-up.  Not very original.  And minus Arnie and the DOA Takashi Miike ultra violence, it serves no purpose.  Why did these districts rebel?  Why are they numbered 1-12?  Real lack of history in the movie.  It's probably explained in the book, but it's not very well explained in the movie.  Characters, as individuals, are unrealistic in their reactions to the situations they're forced into; a lot gaps in the plot, world, and characters.  Also for an all powerful Orwellian government, it's not very impressive.  Dudes with weird safety glasses and batons are not scary wheras FLIR is very scary.  HL2 did it better than this and that's a flippin video game.  I watched this movie hoping to be impressed like I was with Harry Potter, but I was not.  There is no richness or originality to the story.  There is no tragedy when the the subject matter flippin begs for it. Romeo and Juliet, one the greatest stories of all time, was a tragedy and it totally ruled.  Mercutio where are you?  Hollywood sucks.  No guts.  Only sequels.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|THIS motion picture has a very blatant anti-white / pro-whigga message peddled to teens!<br /><br />A Mexican kid asks a WHITE stuck-up girl to a dance and she snottily declines. A geeky white kid ( who happens to be the title character, if that's of any importance ) asks another girl, also a WHITE girl who likewise turns out to be a stuck-up snotty biatch. She agrees to accompany him to the event but ditches him upon arriving there because she was appalled by his crude drawing of her likeness ( which he erroneously used to woo her ). The two white stuck-up girls, as it turns out, happen to be running together in the high school election as president and mate ( respectively ). The previously spurned Mexican and white nerd decide to team together and run against them. Then at some point later in the proceedings, a certain negress arrives upon the scenario, blowing into town on a transit bus. This newly arrived negress, it turns out, is the lover of the white geeky boy title characters whigga brother. He carries on lewdly and ostentatiously with his negress girlfriend and tells the white geeky boy \\"THIS is my soul mate! Yours is out there too somewhere. You just have to wait for her \\" , .. . Hmmmmmmmm, . . I wonder WHAT THAT might possibly be a not-so subtle endorsement of , especially taking the two White snotty stuck-up girls, from earlier in the film, into account? The negress gives geeky white boy an audio casset of some hip hop disco funk'abooty type \\"music\\" and he then practices \\"dancing\\" to it. Finally, at the high school election ceremony, white nerd Wows the audience and wins majority vote by playing the disco hip hop funk'abooty \\"music\\" that the negress had imparted to him and doing a ridiculous \\"dance\\" to it which apparently and inexplicably impresses them greatly ( exclaiming \\"YAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" and obnoxiously chanting loudly, repeatedly and in collective unison \\"GO WHITE BOY!!!!!! GO WHITE BOY!!!!!!!!!! GO WHITE BOY!!!!!!!! ... .. .\\" ), .. . and thus, in the process, CREAMING the duo of stuck up snotty WHITE bitchez who'd scorned them earlier in the film!!<br /><br />Surely one of the most blatant and flagrant examples of white-self hatred and whiggaism promoted in popular teen-oriented media \\"culture\\" by contemporary Joolywood that I have yet beheld!!!!!!!

B009NY43NY|4.0|***Contains Some SPOILERS***<br />I started reading the Sookie Stackhouse Novels just this year and immediately was hooked. I read all thirteen of them in a month. Needless to say I was excited for the release of the final novel. Before I bought it this morning, I read some of the reviews and was a bit upset to see the lack of positive comments. Regardless, I really enjoy this series and decided to read it for myself. I read it in hours and could not put it down. I will start with the good. I think that the way it ended in regards to who Sookie ended up with was the only realistic ending it could have. If you think about it, the other endings that could have been written would not have been permanent solutions if you catch my drift. I don't want to spoil too much but I will say this-to the reviewers who think the man she ended up with came out of no where and that the chemistry didn't exist, let me say this: some of the best and most romantic relationships are born from a healthy and loving friendship first. Sookie has not had the best luck with the men she has dated and I would have felt saddened if she was doomed by CH to live a dangerous life with happiness scattered here and there. I feel that they way it ended gave her the life she deserved with room for interpretation and hope for the future.<br /><br />Now I will concede that some of the writing was not as charming as it was in previous books and it did seem a bit rushed. However, with a lot of the loose ends needing tying, I expected this type of writing. I for one feel it could have been split into more novels. I don't want it to end! Even though I don't feel that the writing was a good as it could be, I feel that the ending was justified and that a lot of the stories came to a close. That is what is important to me. Character resolution and a happy ending. I think Sookie will be happy with her life and all of the hope and possibilities it holds.<br /><br />That being said, I understand why many people arenot happy with the ending. She did not end up with one of the more exciting and dangerous options which is probably why many people enjoy the series (I know I did!). But if we think rationally, CH chose the option which was the most practical and the most long lasting happiness for Sookie in my opinion. Hope you all enjoy this novel and series as much as I have.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Beyond the desecration of what were once such strong supporting characters, I just cannot believe that Sookie has become what she is now. This shell of a person who accepts whatever she can get. There was no Happily Ever After for her. There was no love for her. In the end, Charlaine gave up on Sookie and seemingly decided that her story should end in what is essentially a giant failure.

193700788X|5.0|The 13th and final Sookie Stackhouse novel arrives 12 years after the first outing (2001's DEAD UNTIL DARK) and it's a fitting finish...not that everything is tied up so tightly that there can't be more adventures should Charlaine Harris choose to go back to the series later.<br /><br />Quite a few people online have lost their minds after a jerk in Germany got an advance copy and posted spoilers about the book's ending. I'm NOT POSTING ANY SPOILERS. Real fans of Harris know that her books are about the journey she takes readers on with each outing, it's never about the ending.<br /><br />This is the first Sookie novel that breaks from the first-person narrative with occasional passages that take place outside of Sookie's view in the third-person. This change helps build suspense when we get to ease-drop of some shadowy villains who have an elaborate plan to get their revenge on Sookie.<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable novel. Hard to put down once you start it. And it has a very satisfying conclusion that makes sense emotionally and logically. If you loved the previous books, you'll love this one too!<br /><br />I find it odd that 50 people armed with ONE STAR reviews claim to have gotten a copy and read the whole 338 pages on the very day it was released. Many of you seem to be relying on information from someone who only skimmed the book. Sookie doesn't lose her power or telepathy. And she's ALWAYS had a hard time reading any supe's mind...don't you remember that was one of the early hints in the first couple books that Sam might be a supe? (Before he finally came out.) And Sookie does not discard a relationship in 6 pages!<br /><br />Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I just hope that you'll read the book before you form an opinion. As I said, I think that if you enjoyed the previous 12 books, you're going to enjoy this one too.

0061950726|4.0|I received this book from She Reads in exchange for a fair and honest review.<br /><br />Orphan Train by Christina Baker Kline was a book that took me by surprise.<br /><br />Did you know that between 1854 and 1929 there was an actual orphan train?  The train transported orphans to towns in the US, stopping to try to adopt out the kids.  Adopting out became, in many cases, indentured servitude.<br /><br />Orphan Train tells two intermingled stories.  One story is of Molly, who is struggling in foster care, rebelling, and not able to fit in.  When Molly gets in trouble for stealing Jane Eyre from the local library, she has to complete community service hours.  Molly's hours can be completed by helping Vivian, an older woman who needs to clean out her attic.<br /><br />As Molly helps Vivian clean out the attic, Vivian's story comes into light.  Vivian was an orphan on an orphan train and bounced around from \\"home\\" (if you can call indentured servitude \\"home\\") to home, experiencing some troubling situations.<br /><br />Orphan Train was a captivating book and made me immediately want to research the real orphan trains.  Thankfully, Christina Baker Kline included some information and pictures in the back of the book, so I had a little bit of a head start on my research.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed Orphan Train and love that it made me aware of a time in history that I had no idea existed.  I would definitely pick up another book by Christina Baker Kline.<br /><br />Have you ever heard of the real orphan train???<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book

It tells, in much greater detail than any film could, of the agonizing process that Marcus Vinicius goes through to convert to Christianity. Fiction, yes, but it has the ring of truth to it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read several  so-so reviews, and didn't expect to enjoy this addition as much as I did.<br />I don't understand why  any Hunger Games fan would be disappointed with this book. I read it in a several hours block and could not put it down. The ending is actually awesome.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Oh, maybe it was.  Russell Crowe added much, so did the man who turned bronze, but the rest of it was just okay I'd say.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|its okay but I wouldn't reccemend it. Every time I swiped it made me crash like I went left it would make me roll. It had a good idea just not a good game.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a neat little game to play just to pass the time. Needs a better tutorial in it though. I was totally lost for the first 3 levels.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Ok, so I'm not sure why I wasn't in to this book and find myself still trying to figure it out as I write this review. Was it his character that quite frankly annoyed me that made the reading seem more like a chore, maybe? I like to fall in love with the characters in a story and I guess when reading the reviews some people did (however I didn't). I wanted to shake Charlie. &#34;Get it together, man!&#34;, I wanted to shout, reaching through the pages and grabbing his shoulders. Instead, I put the book down. I waited, knowing I would finish it,  but all the same just procrastinating. Finally a few weeks later I picked it up and began to read until I was done.<br />Another thought of why this book does not go on my favorite list. The character &#34;Charlie&#34;, well I understood that he was socially inept and I understood that he had emotional damage that had scarred him, but there was something else deeper then that. I kept thinking something else is wrong with this kid. Aspergers syndrome is honestly what I kept thinking of and the author never eludes to anything else. The sum of this story is just as I said, a messed up kid with bad social skills and messed up childhood. It just doesn't add up even when I finish the book and you're given the final key to Charlie's history which is I guess suppose to be the &#34;Ohhh...&#34; moment. Well, I never felt that moment and am left thinking the author was lacking in some area or maybe it just wasn't a good fit for me.<br /><br />Anyways, the previews to the movie looked good and I am honestly wondering if the movie made version will give me new perspective. Rented it today and plan on cuddling up with a blanket and try to convince myself that this book was worth the rave reviews it has received.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was convinced by a friend to watch this series from the very beginning.  I had resisted because I thought it was simply a show about zombies.  I am so glad I started watching, however... now I'm addicted.  This show is NOT a show &#34;simply&#34; about zombies!  This show is more about the dynamics of the people and the relationships that form during the course of the program.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED but beware... it IS addictive!!!
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Life of Pi asks big questions but leaves audiences with few answers. This latest Ang Lee movie is an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Yann Martel, which already had a large readership before Lee announced the upcoming film release. Life of Pi tells the story of Piscine Molitor Patel who grows up in India, where his father owns a zoo. He changes his name to \\"Pi\\" to avoid jokes about his name's homophonic similarities to the slang word for urination. The story could be divided into three acts: 1) his years growing up in India, 2) the shipwreck and his life as a castaway, 3) his reflections on his experiences.    The film begins with Pi speaking with a freelance writer. Pi's uncle told this writer that Pi had quite a story to tell and so the writer came to investigate. The film is Pi's narrative.    Though growing up a Hindu, Pi explores Christianity and Islam and finds admirable things in all there. In one scene he is engaged in praying to Allah on a prayer mat; the next shows him crossing himself before he eats. This sequence of shots, with the adult Pi narrating his exploration of religion, confronts the audience immediately with an \\"all paths lead to God\\" form of spirituality that is reflective of the contemporary milieu and the philosophy of John Hick. At this point, Lee has given the film profound religious dimensions.    Pi's father decides to move the family and bring the zoo animals along to sell in North America. On their way, a storm hits the cargo ship and Pi ends up being the sole survivor after being lowered in a lifeboat. The lifeboat also holds a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded Zebra, and a Bengal tiger named \\"Richard Parker.\\" The hyena ends up eating the zebra alive, followed by killing the orangutan, only to be eaten by Richard Parker. Pi ends up fishing to feed the tiger so that he won't decide to eat Pi. They end up coming to an island, which they then leave after discovering that its ecosystem was carnivorous. The lifeboat ends up being washed ashore on the Mexican coast.    After they reach land, Richard Parker journeys into the jungle and leaves no trace behind. Representatives of the cargo ship owners visit Pi in the hospital to learn why the ship sank, but instead get Pi's extraordinary story of survival. They refuse to believe it, so Pi tells a metaphorical story whereby the Zebra is a wounded sailor, the orangutan is his mother, the hyena is the ship's callous cook, and Richard Parker is Pi himself.    Pi asks the writer which version of the saga he prefers. The animal version, he replies. Pi gives him the report filed by the ship company representatives, which reads that Pi held the record for shipwreck survivor longest at sea, and simply notes that he was accompanied by a Bengal tiger. We are left to interpret that comment ourselves. Does this last note demonstrate that there was evidence of a Bengal tiger on the ship and hence lends credence to Pi's story? Or does it merely indicate that the company representatives preferred the fantastical version?    Somehow the audience is expected to come full circle--the beginning of the film asks questions about God's existence and the human spiritual experience and the movie ends with Pi uttering cryptic lines that are supposed to have answered these questions. I left the theater rather unsatisfied, not because there were no answers, but because Lee failed to even provide the connection between the three parts of the film. We moved from big questions in the first part to an end that jumped to a vague interpretation of the castaway experience.    The clear import of the closing scene is that we can choose to view reality as mundane and material, or we can see it in all its manifold beauty that whispers the existence of God as corroborated by mindboggling providence. There is something inherent in us that wants to believe the latter and, lucky for us, the latter is true. If anything, Life of Pi is an argument for the existence of God based on the experience of beauty--whether it is physical beauty (the trailer shows jaw-dropping scenes of splendor that do not disappoint) or the beauty of storytelling.    Life of Pi oddly lacks a theodicy. It doesn't address the pain of why Pi's parents had to die and why there's a Darwinian food chain in the lifeboat. The story might be trying to go one-step more and relegate these painful episodes to being part of the conflict--a necessary component to any good story. And that's what we're wrapped up in: the story of the universal soul. This is intellectually rooted in Hindu-Buddhistic views of cyclical history that can celebrate such a story of suffering without demanding justice from a higher power.    To sum it up, the appetizer in the beginning and the dessert at the end tasted good, but the main course seemed completely unrelated to either. The whole time spent eating the main course was similar to an idyllic and eye-popping version of Tom Hanks's Castaway that singularly focused on survival. I have not read the book, so I'm not sure if Martel does a better job with this, but Lee's adaptation left something to be desired.

0525958002|3.0|Had high hopes for this book but it was a let-down for sure.<br />One of my favorite bass players who unfairly has had a more attention for his looks than his playing ability, now we can add that story telling is not his strong side without being unfair.<br /><br />I wanted to know so much more about the band and the details and bought Andy Taylor's book as soon as I finished this one,<br />Andy's book is everything this one is not, get Andy's book and you won't be disappointed.

B00BHU2A7I|5.0|The opening scene of Hitchcock met with erupting laughter from the theater audience. Ed Gein--the inspiration for the novel Psycho--killed his brother with a shovel to the head in a most comedic way; after which the camera panned to Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) who speaks directly to the audience and prepares them to go behind the scenes of the making of the Psycho movie. The film captures a slice of Hitch's (a nickname) life, limiting itself to his efforts to bring Psycho to the big screen--from casting and screenplay-drafting to its debut.    Hitch's strained relationship with his wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren), also an accomplished director, takes central stage, relegating the actual filming of Psycho to a supporting role.    At first, we do not realize there is any problem between Hitch and Alma, other than the fact that they sleep in separate beds yet in the same room. (I'm not sure whether this is a nod to historical idiosyncrasy or a throwback to the I Love Lucy days of censorship where even insinuations of the marriage bed was forbidden.) But Alma decides to help a man named Whit Cook with his screenplay and is increasingly enthralled by him, driven away by Hitch's obsession with finding the perfect blond to fantasize over. Alma and Hitch eventually discover that their fantasies are illusions and Alma invests all of herself back into the Psycho production.  Alma had a fantasy of romance that involved the a melding of two creative minds as they typed away on the back porch of an idyllic beach house while sipping wine. This fantasy is crushed when she finds him with a young woman in their hideaway. Hitch's fantasy fails when he can't catch the perfect blond who has beauty and mystery that can last indefinitely. Janet Leigh (the lead female of Psycho played here by Scarlett Johansson) is a Hitchcock admirer, but keeps her distance and remains professional in their work relationship. We also learn that Vera Miles (another actress in Psycho played by Jessica Biel) was originally a \\"Hitchcock girl,\\" but decided to get married and have a child.    In both these cases, Hitchcock as a love story, drama, and romantic comedy offers a stunningly realistic portrayal of love in marriage. Hitch and Alma are old and unattractive, looking for something fresh and novel, but end up discovering that such a wild goose chase results in only the bitter taste of disappointment. This is refreshing and presents a perspective on romance that runs counter to the common Hollywood line.    But Hitchcock goes beyond a mere love story--though it would have been a good enough movie had it stuck to just that. The film is also a study of Hitchcock's philosophy of film, or at least an inquiry into why thrillers and horror movies have such a wide appeal (the very appeal Hitchcock played on so often in his movies). The answer may lie less in the ability of the filmmaker as it does in our innate human resonance with murder.    In the opening scene described above, Hitch observes that brother has been killing brother since Cain and Abel. This biblical allusion acts as an anchor for the rest of Hitchcock. Hitch describes this human fascination with gruesome death a number of times throughout the film. More chillingly, Ed Gein makes an appearance in the film on several occasions; first as Hitch's psychiatrist, then offering advice and insights much like an alter ego.    On one hand, this may be a tribute to Hitchcock's artistry of enmeshing himself into the twisted psyche of his characters; yet there is a literal parallel between Hitch and Gein. This reaches a climax in the infamous shower scene of blood-curling-screams-and-flashing-knife fame. Janet Leigh is failing to impress and Hitch decides to take the knife into his own hands, which gets the response from Janet that he desires: terror. As Hitch slashes the air with the knife, a variety of characters take Janet's place in rapid succession: the Paramount Pictures representative that has been givinghim a hard time; Whit Cook, the scoundrel wooing his wife.    Hitchcock was refreshing in its originality, depth, appropriate exploration of mature themes, and a surprisingly biblical worldview. I highly recommend it.

1451697686|5.0|I've been a fan of Bea's blog for years and was thrilled that the book has lots of new tips and ideas and gives a more complete picture of Bea's particular eco-approach. As a former art student with two school age boys also, I related to her creative solutions to the plastic filled challenges of daily life. But I think the book has wide appeal for anyone looking to consume less plastic and/or lead a simpler life. I'm no where near to their level of non-production of garbage, but I would guess that we all have to pick and choose the steps we can take (i.e. while I'm in a big city, the bulk options are no where near what is available in Bea's area). I'm attacking my junk mail with renewed zeal and have tried many of the recipes: throat lozenges, laundry detergent, vanilla, tortillas, and the lovely multi-purpose balm.  I agree with Bea that it is very satisfying, not to mention cheaper, to replace consumption with a little effort (and the kids love to help).

B004J64QSI|4.0|I eagerly anticipated viewing this concert and I was not disappointed, except in two aspects [see below].  Alfie Boe, trained as an opera singer, gave a powerful, passionate, emotional performance as &#34;Jean ValJean.&#34;  Norm Lewis, also a highly-trained and experienced performer, was strong, masterful, articulate as &#34;Javert&#34; and played the part with great dignity and authority.  Lea Salonga was exquisite and convincing as the tragic &#34;Fantine.&#34;  If you saw the 2012 Les Mis Film, you will recognize Samatha Barks in the role of Eponine; she was as confident, powerful, and perfect in her role in this concert as she was in the film. Ramin Karimloo portrayed &#34;Enjolras&#34; and gave a powerful performance; he confidently carried the lead in many of the most rousing ensemble songs.  &#34;Cosette,&#34; portrayed by Katie Hall was lovely, articulate, strong, and confident but the love story was not realistic because her counterpart, Nick Jonas, who portrayed &#34;Marius,&#34; was younger than she and was a less experienced performer.  Robert Madge, as the gamin, &#34;Gavroche&#34; was perfect as the young, impish, brave street-wise orphan.<br /><br />The reason I did not give this recording five stars was for two deficits:  1] the casting of Nick Jonas in the role of 'Marius&#34; was a disaster:  he was obviously the weak link in the production and was clearly unseasoned, compared to all the superb, experienced opera and musical theater professionals. 2] the casting of Jenny Gallaway, in the role of &#34;Madame Thenardier&#34; was a mistake because she was, in fact, twenty years older than Matt Lucas, the performer who portrayed &#34;Monsieur Thenardier.&#34;<br /><br />However, the merits of this recording far outweigh the deficits.  I will watch this recording every year and enjoy it each time.  Be sure and watch the performance past the &#34;curtain calls&#34; because they the production will include some delightful special guest stars.

B008OOYALE|5.0|I have been playing this game for quite awhile because it challenges you to try to come up with the right combination of dragons to make new and different dragons....sometimes it can get very frustrating, but you just keep at it because it becomes a quest to get the new dragon.  And when you finally do get the dragon you were working towards, you become elated with the sucess!  A very, very, addicting game.

B0057R5G6E|5.0|There are lots of great reviews here about the movies and the technical details on the discs.<br /><br />I will take a minute to make two points.<br /><br />1. The downloads of all three movies : the box states \\"Download by 12/31/2012\\". I successfully downloaded all three movies in May 2013, so regardless of the box note or even the info on the access code sheet - all three are still available ( free ) as of 05/2013. I believe these free downloads have been extended until 2015, so ignore the documentation and get your downloads (available in iTunes or WindowsMedia formats).<br /><br />2. The included sculpture is pretty cool. It's made of a heavy plastic and honestly is very eye catching and well made. It even has a little heft to it, which adds to the quality. I've purchased other collections with statues and been very disappointed (hello, Batpod, I'm talking to you) but this T-Rex is stylish, excellently colored and a nice addition to this set. The description of the statue from the certificate of authenticity states : this document certifies that the Jurassic Park T-rex dinosaur status is an original product designed and cast for this Limited Edition Blu-Ray Trilogy Gift Set. The hand molded die cast is an exact representation of the T-rex from the Jurassic Park film, approved and certified authentic by Universal Studios Home Entertainment. There will be no further editions of this distinct hand painted statue.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am so sad.  I think Ms Harris just made an outline of all the story lines and characters and mashed them up, wrote a rough draft and sent it to the publisher who in turn just proofread for grammar, punctuation and spelling.  I am not even sure she wrote this book.  Others have expressed their reviews more eloquently than I can at this moment.  I have only one thing to add:  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS BOOK!  Wait for it to come out in paperback.  Better yet, wait to find it at a garage sale for 25 cents.  Then only read it after you have read all the cereal boxes in your house.  It is that awful.
B00AO7HQ06|2.0|This box set can be evaluated two ways, depending on your priorities: Are you a musician or guitarist interested in hearing every lick Duane ever played, or are you a music fan looking for some good ear candy?<br />I am of the latter. I am a huge Allman Brothers fan. I was excited when I saw this definitive box was being released. Fortunately, I had some gift money that I used to purchase the item. It did not come out of the household budget. My review will look at the merit of this set as if you have to convince your significant other of the $120 buy in price.<br />It's a long and varied set, that has some revelatory moments, but is ultimately musically disappointing.  For Allman BrothersBand fans, the first disc is certainly going to be the most interesting. The first three songs were recorded in 1965, and are superb on their own merit. Considering Duane and Gregg weren't even 20 years old, it's even more enlightening. Next up is the Allman Joys, and the Hour Glass. Much of this has been previously available, but never in such a complete and clean sounding fashion. You can hear from the get go, what the musical priorities of the Allman brothers are (soul, blues, a little jazz), and these tracks are the DNA than would create our favorite band.  Thrown in for good measure is an early version of Melissa, which is interesting, but better versions have come around since.<br />Than we hit this sets downfall, in an effort at being completist, lots of disc space is used on mediocre and forgotten artists that Duane played with. Just because Duane Allman played on a track, does not make it great. Starting with \\"The Bleus\\" at the end of disc one, all the way up through track two on disc three, its a long wade through some middling songs. Unbelievably, some great Stax artists appear, like Clarence Carter, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, and King Curtis, but the songs fall flat surrounded by similar sounding music by lesser artists.  Black artists playing white songs can sometimes sound like a wrong way street.  Most of these selections I found disappointing. We have two iffy versions of \\"The Weight\\" by the Band, neither as good as the version at end of the Love for Levon CD.<br />Duane himself comes in for three songs on disc three. \\"Going Down Slow\\" was previously heard on the Dreams box set, and the next two were released on the Duane anthology: \\"No Money Down\\" and \\"Happily Married Man\\". Both are excellent. \\"No Money Down\\" rocks with a brash energy provided by Duane's hyper vocal, and ridiculous ad libbing (a psychedelic strobe spot). We can see why these tracks are on a different level, Berry Oakley and Johnny Sandlin play on them.<br />Otis Rush, the Duck and the Bear, and Boz Scaggs are in the middle of disc 3. I personally like the fun funky jive of the Duck and the Bear. Duanes lengthy outro on Boz Scagg's \\"Loan me a Dime\\" is well known. But some of the Otis Rush and Boz Scagss songs suffer the same mediocrity issue.<br />Than we get the Allman Brothers Band crashing in with \\"Dont Want you No more\\". It felt like 1969 for the first time ever for me, (I'm only 39). Those opening notes of the first album punch every other song we have heard out of the water with power and inspiration.  From the moment Gregg growls at the beginning of \\"Cross to Bear\\" to the last notes of \\"Whipping Post' its amazing. But why? Why put the whole album on the set? Why split it between two discs?  Don't most people buying this have all these songs already?<br />And so it goes for the next two discs....more forgettable music by second rate artists, that gets crowded out by songs you already know from the Allman Brothers Band or Derek and the Dominoes.  We could get excited about \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" from the Grateful Dead.  I have this set already on several bootlegs. It sounds as muddled and confused here as it does on an old cassette. It's not a dream come true for Allmans and Dead fans, Duane playing with the Grateful Dead. It's a confused messy jam, and better versions of Sugar Mags are out there, too.<br />By the time you get to the 7th disc you are hoping for some relief.  The entire 7th disc is listenable on its own. We have the great live show with Delaney and Bonnie, but many ask why not the whole thing? The famous \\"You Don't Love me/Soul Serenade\\" tribute to King Curtis. Than the beautiful \\"Please be with me \\" by Cowboy. A couple more redundant Allman Brothers Band songs, before two ABB songs  that demand a listen. The live version of 'Blue sky\\" is amazing.  It will now be my preferred listening version of this song. Gregg sings harmony vocals a little behind Dickey (like Levon Helm did with the Band), and both solos are scorching. This is followed up by a lengthy, moody, and intense version of \\"Dreams\\".  Both of these songs are available through Hittin the Note as the SUNY stony Brook archival CD.<br /><br />A word about the packaging, it is lovely, it comes with a sticker and guitar pick. If you handle the sleeves carefully they won't break immediately, but I have been super careful and mine are starting to wear.  It all looked so cool when I unpacked it.<br />Than I began to listen, and listen. Every disc several times. As you can tell, I am a bit disappointed at the musical quality of the affair.  It most definitely tells the Duane Allman story, warts and all. What I learned from it, is that we already have the majority of what is the best of Duane Allman. Put on Live at the FIllmore East, and Layla one more time. It really doesn't get much better than that.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's worth the money : ) I suggest getting it, it's cool. Its nice because all you have to do is charge it while it's on because Kindle can't turn off and still have the alarm working while it's &quot;asleep&quot;, anyways it's helpful to have.

B002ZJCQT2|3.0|This book was a good concept.  Really, it was.  And the author made a good attempt at making the topic understandable.  But I still could not tell you anything more about Quantum Physics than I could before- it simply slipped into jargon a bit too much.  I think it's concepts are simply too foreign to actually be explained simply.

193700788X|1.0|I've been with Sookie since the beginning. I don't consider myself an 'entitled reader'. When the majority of readers interpret a story the same way I think it means the writer isn't in tune with her characters, or maybe she was just in it for the money.<br /><br />After the first book I thought Eric was horrible, and after a couple of books ended up thinking of him as one of my favorite characters from any book or series. In the first book I actually wanted her with Sam.  With every new book I realized more and more that Sookie didn't love him, and believe me I looked for clues hoping that she did.  The last couple of books were not written as well, it seemed as if CH just didnt' care, and after reading interviews it seems she didn't.  She choose to  keep writing romantic scenes between Sookie and Eric, and zero romantic scenes between Sookie and Sam. One thing I was always sure of was the books would stick with the love conquers all message, the message of differences don't matter.  Instead the message was settling for second best is okay.  Charlaine Harris duped me with book after book featuring Eric and Sookie together. Her publishers must have told her that Eric sold books, just like they told her she couldn't kill Bill. As with any character you care about, I just wanted Sookie to end up happy. I really thought it would be the Kelly Taylor \\"I choose me!\\" ending. I would have been disappointed, but after everything Sookie has been through it would have made sense. This ending just doesn't make any sense! If there had been any hint that she thought of Sam as anything other than a friend I would be satisfied with the ending. I really always liked Sam.  But Sookie and Sam was not the story that was written. I do think it was pretty selfless of Eric to give up his freedom to protect Sookie. Like any consort he really doesn't get anything out of the marriage deal. I feel like I wasted lots of money and lots of my time with this series. I feel so cheated I might givethe other books away.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|This movie is awesome :-)  I have been watching Beetlejuice since it first came out and decided that I needed to upgrade from my DVD to Blu Ray and wasn't disappointed.  What a fun movie that really stands the test of time.  Day-O!!!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|This was a difficult situation to weave a story around. As the story develops, it's hard to imagine where the plot will go and you realize that no matter how the ending goes, there is no winner. The author manages to keep the suspense going till the end. The characters are intricate but very real. You'll want to love them but sometimes you'll want to hate them. All in all, this book was good considering the subject.
B004HD61KE|5.0|If your into the sigma force novels, this was really<br />good, couldn't put it down, I am starting on Bloodline now.<br /><br />My daughter in law gave me two books, from her parents as<br />not really her taste.  They were  my first ever read by James Rollins<br />and they were the Sigma Force Novels, I was missing the one in between<br />so I got it from the library and I have been hooked ever since.<br />Awesome job James Rollins!
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|This is a very nice set for any Mad Season fan.  The DVD that comes with it is awesome!  Lots of cool live sets they did.  The other songs they added to the album with the Screaming Trees singer are ok.  Would have been better with Layne.  But its still better than no new songs.  Highly recommend getting it even if you own the original like I do.  Lots of great stuff packed into the CD.
B0001I562I|5.0|It was so much fun to see this movie again!!!  I was talking with my fiance one day and mentioned that I loved the movie Flight of the Navigator and he agreed that it was a childhood favorite of his as well, so we of course had to come to Amazon to find it.  I'm so glad we have it now so I can watch it whenever I want.  Kind of funny how the times have changed since the 1980's, as there is some raunchy language in there considering it is a Disney movie made for children.  Still a classic though and I love it :-)
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks is both a great storyteller and a keen social commentator. Really fun read...but if we have to go through this, it won't be nearly as fun.
0525478817|3.0|I had to read this, seemed like a lot of hype about how<br />great this book was.  It was ok, excellantly written, but<br />maybe it was just to sad for me.  I'm giving it to my two<br />teenage granddaughters to see what they think.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this cd and Ed Sheeran. He has a amazing voice, very rare in today's music industry and his lyrics have so much meaning. His songs go from catchy and fun, to soulful and touching. I've listened to it about 20 times and still can't get enough.
B009NY43NY|1.0|i look forward to waking up on tuesdey mornings once a year and running to target to get the new sookie book.<br /><br /> I had read a few reviews before i left so I was sure it was gonna be bad, I prob should not have read them even though i know it would not change how bad it was.<br /><br /> few things, even though it was not  eric in the end, i wanted that, but I can live without that outcome, a little. I do like her with a human, but alcide would have been better. it was forced with sam , even though I like him and he is a good guy. just not for sookie.<br /><br />ok why it was really bad is beacuse eric was not in it and he ended up a slave to a vampire. how degrading for him and i can not belive that it how she ended his story. whatever.<br /><br />then mr. c. becasue I have no idea how to spell it. had more time in this book than all the main char. ummm, what?<br /><br />and I liked how all her friends came to help her but thats it.<br /><br />all in all. its like that feeling you get when they cancel your favorite show on a cliffhanger.
193700788X|1.0|I actually feel physically ill.  Seriously?  Like so many others, I have invested over the last 12 books, so many emotions and love for all of Charlaine Harris's wonderful characters and when I have read and re-read and re-read the books I have felt like I was almost part of her crazy, but amazing world.  I am beyond disappointed  with the ending, I am heartbroken.  Really?  Charlaine Harris picks the one character I feel the least for.  I have never felt any depth or substance from him.  The ending felt so rushed.<br />I wnat to shout at Charlaine Harris \\"Do over!  Do over!\\", but I know that won't happen, so instead I will find the best fan-fiction I can and staple it into my copy of DEA.
0316077046|4.0|It was a little slow at first, but then got really interesting, Can't<br />wait to start on the third book.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This was like no story I'd read before.  Totally absurd and completely unbelievable but once one accepts that it's a work of pure fiction, an enjoyable journey.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I have read nearly all of Brandon Sanderson's books after discovering him when he took over Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series after Jordan passed away and I think very highly of his writing.  This book is the first in what appears to be Sanderson's grand series and it is definitely worthy.  I just finished mt second read through of this book and I enjoyed it more the second time.  He takes the time to flesh out his characters and you get the sense that he is very methodical and caring about his work.  The second book should be out in November and I am beyond impatient.  Keep up the great writing!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|the pen uv ink combo is pretty cool the only issue i think is the light could be brighter and the sound could be a little louder, maybe its me :)
0880790121|4.0|Bought this because of the art. Ended up disliking some of the art.. but lucky for me It was pretty easy to change the art I disliked with markers. The over abundance of blondes and the creepy floating heads on one of the cards for example... Easily made a few brunettes and darker haired folk.. and put elemental symbols over those creepy floating heads.. So the art style lends itself to modding.<br /><br />It's a good, if wry and a bit dry, reading deck. I use this one when reading other for people. It isn't as brutally honest as other decks (which is very nice.) but gives a good read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so amazing!!!!!!!!!! The graphics are so realistic! I want to play this game every day!! I definitely recommend this app for people who love horses! :)
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I love the game but it won't play anymore,it made me get rly into it then not play anymore :(
B005UDD1R6|3.0|It was not was I was expecting and did not work for the needs that I had for my LG phone,  I ended up removing it as it would not work properly on my particular phone even though it was accepted as a match, that is not to say it is not a good product it just was not what I needed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really liked this game I get addicted to it sometimes. I also have lot of fun others should play too
B0013ND30W|5.0|My daughter was in that phase when everything must have been AURORA!<br />So for her birthday party, you guessed.. themed Sleeping Beauty..<br />she got for a gift her very own dvd and the most beautiful Disney Store Disney Princess Darlings Magic Castle Play Set with Aurora and Phillip Dolls. She was simply mesmerized. Both gifts complemented each other in such an amazing way.<br />Whenever she watches the movie she will set up the castle to play with and the other way around.<br />The movie is timeless classic. It is one of those stories we hear from early childhood and the disc is well worth the money. Please be careful showing to a little one under 5 as some kids at this age do not  distinguish between fantasy and imagination and reality and some scenes might be freighting. I would strongly advise parental guidance and watch prior to showing little one and then watch with her and forward what is scary until you know she is mature enough not to worry about the scary parts. This is true to all Disney Princess movies, and still so worth experiencing as they are timeless and beautiful stories.
0988936402|4.0|Thank you Telemachus Press for sending a copy of EVERVILLE: THE FIRST PILLAR to review. The edition is beautifully designed with old world fonts and printed on high quality paper.<br /><br />The story opens with Owen Sage, a normal college freshman with the jitters, getting inexplicably drawn into a parallel universe called Everville. While Sage is there, he encounters new life forms and becomes embroiled in a dramatic conflict between warring factions. He forms an alliance with The Keeper of the Frons against \\"Them,\\" an esoteric and demonic race that resides in The Other In Between, a purgatorial underworld.<br /><br />Sage doesn't seem to have control over his time-space travel, and at any given moment can move from his earthly setting at Easton Falls University to Everville and back. It doesn't help his social life. Along the way, he inducts his college buddies, Dante and Anika, to defeat the demons of the underworld before they do more harm to Everville and carry out a plan against the earth.<br /><br />This first volume of an upcoming series, is a fast-paced, imaginative, light adventure, which would appeal to middle grade and early teens. Roy Huff's strength as a writer seems to lie in his vivid descriptions of otherworldly settings and life forms. In subsequent books, I'd love to see more of that attention given to characters' motivations, inner conflicts, personal stakes, relationships, dialogue and changes (from beginning to end), that is to say, to explore nuances of character through specific arcs.<br /><br />I congratulate Roy on publishing his first book, and<br />wish him every success. Thank you.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This movie was certainly as advertised.  The acting was stellar and it had you on the edge of your seat.  Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field were fabulous.  While I seldom agree with the Academy Awards as to who won, Daniel Day-Lewis certainly deserved to win.
B004IG8WPM|5.0|We watched this movie with our daughters recently. I remember watching it as a kid. Still enjoyable after all these years, and the kids loved it, too!
0525478817|5.0|This book is unusually honest, thought-provoking, and moving. At first, the love element reminded me of Twilight, but this book is far too intelligent and eloquent to sustain that comparison.<br /><br />Helpfully, it gives insight into how teen cancer patients might think and feel. (It's not always sanctified.)<br /><br />This book is particularly transparent in its (existential) worldview and baldly confronts questions of life, death, and eternity. The Christianity Hazel encounters seems to be an anemic, superficial collection of catchphrases: \\"Living your best life now.\\" Hazel treats it as an indulgent, irrelevant sentimentality, and it's no wonder. Much like Solomon at certain points in his Ecclesiastes, she rages, rages against the dying of the light, in a finite, meaningless universe, and she needs solid meaning.<br /><br />When reading this book, I sometimes wished Hazel could see a robust picture of the God of the Bible, the God Who rules over the mystery and misery. The God Who knows suffering better than any other, the God Who took on the cancer of my sin: the crucified God. The God Who makes all things new. She hears echoes of Him in the goodness of creation and in the love of Gus and her family. But in her zero-g world, these can never bring the ultimate gravity she needs.<br /><br />--<br /><br />By the way, the audiobook performance is amazing--perhaps even better than reading the physical book!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is a phenomenal performer.  This CD captures his energy.  Some of the songs are not appropriate for younger listeners, but his lyrics and music show a lot of creative intensity.
B006LMMN8I|4.0|Good album to listen to from beginning to end over and over again.<br />On my way to Harlem, When did you learn and Work Song are some particular faves of mine!!!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I bought this for my wife's Kindle Fire and it works great.  She loves the color and the material.  Really good protection, gives you different ways to use as a screen stand and has magnet that helps with automatic turn on and off the screen by just opening and closing he case.<br /><br />Reliable product and it has a competitive price.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I like Bruno Mars.  His energy and music are electric.  This is a great CD.  It is not often I like all of the songs on a CD.
0142418471|5.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson<br /><br />This is one of my favorite books. I love the story and the way it is written. The characters are great and funny. The book wasn't at all what I expected it to be, it was way better. I fell in love at the very beginning and I will find myself rereading this book in the future. The writing was beautiful, the pacing was great, and the storyline rocked. It kept me entertained and I never once got bored.<br /><br />The title of the book says it all, and it's  fun to say and very memorable. The cover is really cool, but it almost doesn't match the story. I wish it had two guys or something on it.<br /><br />I would most definitely read this again, and tell my friends to read it.<br /><br />I'd rate it a 5/5
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Had to rush out and buy it after renting it  the kids watched it over and over they love it
B008TT7CXW|4.0|The DiMeCard-SD: SD + micro SD Memory Card Holder is a great idea, and works very well with SD and Micro SD cards. However, the Micro SD card adapters are hard to retrieve from the case.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I've been struggling to find new music, something different from this mainstream music that sounds all the same. I listened to a preview of some of the songs on this album and I knew I had found what I was looking for. Lindsey's music is absolutely amazing and this album is my new favorite: I love each and every single song! I highly recommend it to all music lovers.
B002M9WW30|5.0|The first Rocky is what I consider the greatest sports film ever made. This set is inexpensive and offers a great blu ray viewing experience.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I just started watching this show and I love it! The amount of crazies in this series is ridiculous! If you enjoy some action/drama I'd recommend you try this out!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A game that became an addition for me.  It never is dull. Each level is just different to be interesting.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I enjoy this game.  It's my coffee break. I play it every day. It's a great distraction. I'm not a gamer. I'm a forty something mom. I like clearing a screen.  I tell my kids, hold on mommy has to clear this screen. It's fun.
0345529057|5.0|This is a great series!!! This particular set is great! It comes in a nifty little box to keep them together.
193700788X|1.0|This book is a waste of time and money, I just wish I would have realized a while ago that they would end in utter disappointment.  I defended this woman and now I'm disgusted with my actions, she will get nothing else from me.  She claims that the final book would be about Sookie evolving, but she didn't evolve at all.  She just went right back to the beginning as if nothing had changed, I don't know what the author was smoking when writing this, but based on the books I read, there was nothing to suggest that she belonged with Sam.  To me she's just settling, it's not love, and now Sookie is going to live a miserable existence.  That just shows how little CH cares about her own characters, it's sad we know them better than she does.  Why give us all of that build up between them if it wasn't going to lead anywhere?  Why screw the Eric fans over when we are the majority of the fanbase?  We are the reason these books were so popular, that shows she was just in it for the money, but we'll be the ones laughing when book sales aren't as high as they were in the past.  I actually prefer the show now, which is something I never thought would happen. The books are what made me love Eric in the first place and no matter what she does, that's never going away.  All she did was make me hate Sookie even more, job well done.
B00199B2Z8|4.0|Cleverly written narratives.  Reminds of the thoughtful commentary of the late Andy Rooney, although not nearly as negative as Mr. Rooney often was.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This movie is absolutely wonderful! If you're a major fan of the book and fear change you may not be a fan, they did take some liberties with the story. But it was still magical and heartwarming! And fun battles!!!!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I love this app it is a realy good app I realy think u you should get this app ok go and get it now plezzz get it you need it :)
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|From the music, to costumes, to make-up and more, this film is delicious. In surround sound it gave everyone goose bumps.<br />A must see for those who appreciate excellent cinematography, directing, special effects, and acting.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is better than anything I've ever played the best first person shooter so much detail I would  rate it with gta it's so gould
B005KAH7QU|4.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this different film. Off the beaten track but beautifully filmed, this story is engrossing. It is a must see.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for people to play I downloaded it thinking it was something different and was planning on deleting it but thought it was a great game
0062218867|3.0|I have long been a fan of Sir Terry's, but alas! Even the actions scenes were too slow and lugubrious in this one. Treasure Sir Terry in his prime and maybe give this one a pass.
0385344333|2.0|As others have said, I am a Lee Child fan and a Jack Reacher fan.  I look forward to all his writings about my hero.  However, this book was atrocious!  A great deal of the verbiage was unnecessary, I mean who cares about the local details of an Interstate highway - I don't.  It's as though Child was getting paid by the word and he needed to fill pages.<br /><br />The plot was needlessly convoluted and in the end, nothing significant was accomplished.<br /><br />With this publication Lee's star is definitely on the wane.
B008OW1S3O|4.0|Several songs on this album stand out. I recommend it to those who enjoy abstract music. Hopefully we see something in the near future with a change of tempo or some new instruments
B006T3RM08|3.0|Love the idea, like the looks, but as many reviewers have posted it creates an issue with the trackpad sticking in the down position. The tolerance may be a little too tight, but the larger issue is just that the dock isn't completely rigid and will skew when placed on an uneven surface (like a lap). I can generally get it working again by sighting down the edge and twisting it back into a straighter line, but it really is pretty bad to have to do this. So, it's certainly not as useless as the most negative reviews here would have you believe, but don't expect it to &#34;just work&#34;.<br /><br />Purchased April 2013.
193700788X|1.0|I have to say, this is the worst book i've read in a long long time, maybe ever. It became pretty clear to me that the author just wanted to hurry up and finish the series because nothing was fleshed out. She ended a long term relationship in the matter of 6 pages (it took her 6 books to build that relationship) Almost every character didn't seem like themselves at all. It was like CH handed over her series to a bad fanfic writer to finish for her, wait no that's even insulting to bad fanfic writers...<br /><br />I found numerous instances where CH contradicted herself from something she said in a prior book. Did she forget her own story?<br /><br />Overall, bad writing, bad plotlines. What a shameful way to end a series like this...
193700788X|4.0|******Spoilers*****<br />What did Sookie want? be a grand-mother and be with somebody she could not read... Sookie-Eric...I will always love you...
B002I9Z8DK|5.0|Not a bad transfer to Blu-ray. I really liked the story. Great to see all the original cast one last time.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Spot on YA fiction. It's. West Side story with a modern twit It's an emotional, gritty and raw. I loved the dual POVs; it was a great insight into understanding the characters better. Thank you Simone Elkeles for shedding some light into the reality of non traditional families and delving into some pretty heavy subjects of special needs, gangs. social class, and high school overall. I can see why she was honored by the Illinois Association of Teachers of English.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The blu-ray transfer is very good. The movie, for me at least, wasn't as good as the two previous. I really loved the Dark Knight, with the great Heath Ledger, as my favorite superhero movie ever!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game with a passion!!! It is a great spend. I recommend this to anyone!!! This game is great to play around with or to just plainly build!!
B0067R0APK|3.0|Initially I bated the fact that they changed the app. Its been completely overhauled and doesn't even resemble the old app. Learning this new one has been a little tricky cuz it doesn't really come with any type of instruction. One must just kind of mill around and figure it out. This one seems to take a lot longer to load and longer to bring up the info I'm looking for.<br /><br />Not really sold on it and thinking about going back to weather.com app. I was more comfortable with that one and the app was quicker than what this one has become.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|Truly, the man is Scotland's greatest asset. I do him in a heartbeat too, woof! Maybe a trip's in order.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's awesome! Better than the first Temple Run! More action, more fun! A.W.E.S.O.M.E.! It's worth every penny! You NEED to get this app!
B005FLX1HS|3.0|First it's an EP CD, I HATE EP CD's.  I'd rather download it.  Scary Monsters (A Tribute to David Bowie?)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Oh my goodness. This book is so twisting and powerful. I love it it fits what I needed to read. It's an amazing read
B004KRQFI0|3.0|Been there, done that, reasonablely competent musician.  he's new, he'll grow into his Skrillix  Wonder what it means, but didn't really try to find out.  Too busy...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I heard of Hugh Howey's success with Wool and wanted to check it out, mostly out of jealousy, to see how it might compete with my first e-book \\"[[ASIN:B00596UX20 Map of Dreams]].\\" To the gentleman and fellow scrivener, Mr. Howey, I must concede ~ I have been fairly and re-soundly bested! Wool is exquisitely well crafted, with nearly perfect tempo, rich and varied characters, a compelling and unpredictable story, and a splendid balance between poetic nuance and scientific rigor. The latter is sure to satisfy the most discriminating of geeks, of which I am chief. Finally, if you learn why Mr. Howey wrote the story, as told on his blog, you will find Wool is rife with complex social implications that will liven up any conversation between readers and non-readers alike. Well done, Mr. Howey.\\"Superb\\" is insufficient.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book rocked, kept my attention. The only down side was not enough focus on the romance at the end.
0307271862|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was well written, had a good plot, and all in all was a worthwhile read.  One problem: if you're the type who likes to guess the ending, you may be disappointed to be correct when you've actually made your way through the whole novel.<br /><br />I suppose I had unreasonably high expectations from Wallander.
B001QVFDA4|4.0|I love Gerard Butler....and all the other eye candy in this movie! You get to see bit of Tom Hardy in here as well! BONUS!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game all the time.  It helps to reduce stress while at the same time making your mind work.  Great fun!
B006RXQ800|5.0|A very good movie. DiCaprio does a great job in this. I would rate this movie a 5 star film.
125000098X|2.0|I was so excited for this book that I pre-ordered it from Amazon - the first in the series was excellent and the second was good, so I was hoping for a satisfying read. The story was weak and often boring, characters were introduced and not developed, and with the exception of a brief interesting part toward the end of the book the entire thing was a waste of time. When you tack on an absolutely CRAP ending that makes you think a fourth book must be on the horizon, well, I wish I'd saved my money.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well told story. Read it in 2 days. Visual, exciting and emotionally entertaining. Glad it is fiction. Looking forward to the rest of the saga.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I like the dictionary it is very handy to have in a pinch and I like the simplicity of handling it. I like the fact that it saves the recent searches.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|I just love this movie.  It has great music and is just so much fun to watch.  I have watched it over and over again.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|My wife has not stopped listening to this cd. I bought it over 3 months ago. she didn't even know who they were
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This was my daughters favorite when she was a little girl. We still love to watch it to this day.  It's a movie the whole family can watch together,
B0042ESTQW|5.0|Covers my Garmin like I want it to without getting in the way. Why is there a minimum word count for a review?
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Jodie foster gives a great performance with a well rounded cast to back her up. I've always loved this movie.
B00007KWHG|5.0|We went to see the Jersey Boys and this was a must have.  I had a few songs on different cd's, but this one has them all.
B00051E906|4.0|This is a good product for the price - since it is much cheaper than other radiation detectors, one can not hold against it that it looks and feels rather light and very plastic.<br />The readings take a while before giving the reliable result.<br />Be careful also with the batteries (which are not included) - you have to read the product manual to know whether to use AA or AAA batteries - this is not clear from the product itself, at least I did not see it.
034580404X|3.0|to much sex and not enough story, good love story just got tired of page after page of sex, ending was good.
0545265355|5.0|I enjoyed these books. I didn't get them until after seeing the first movie.  It takes a lot for me to sit down and read a book. I've really only done that with the Harry Potter books and the Chronicles of Narnia. But these books held my interest, and I actually read the last book in 11 hours straight on one day! That's unheard of for me!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent<br />I really enjoyed reading all of the books. I can't wait to see them portrayed on the big screen.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|BBC/PBS could have turned the original 500 page Screenplay into a four season, 24 episode \\"Downton Abbey\\" mini-series type classic but Hollywood turned it into a 2.5 hour bore. As far as subject matter, Hollywood is able to miraculous turn prime-rib into hamburger steak and spend multi-millions of dollars doing it - like this movie.
125000098X|3.0|Another cliffhanger ending. Argh! When is the next one due out? Fun, fast read. Wish he had done a trilogy, the suspense is killing me.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Okay, my ONLY beef with purchasing \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" - and I bought the 3D version - is that there will be an extended version to be released later this year... Grr... I'm wondering the the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy will be remastered for 3D release (both theatrical and home video). Imagine the Battle of Pelennor Fields...<br /><br />That having been said, I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that I was initially dismayed to know that Peter Jackson would not be directing \\"The Hobbit\\"... Nothing against Guillermo Del Toro's work; on the contrary, it would have been rather interesting to see his take on Tolkien's world. However, given the triumph that was the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, I think it's safe to say that Peter Jackson has pretty much breathed life into Tolkien's vision, artistic liberties notwithstanding, and pretty much owns Middle Earth. \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" once again made me feel like I did back in 2001. I never even understood all the hoopla surrounding Jackson's use of new projection technology. I found \\"The Hobbit\\" to be visually stunning and entertaining. Like millions of others, I can't wait for this coming Christmas!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I purchased Seasons 1&2 together in a combo pack from Sam's Club. We did a marathon viewing and could not wait to see Season 3! So it was Amazon to the rescue!
B005GIS1WA|4.0|not the best but there are MUCH worse kids movies out there.  It's no NEMO or Toy Story but then again...
B00009RAJH|5.0|\\" Rumours' was already a landmark album but to hear how the songs came together in the studio only adds to that. A must have for all FM fans and anyone with the slightest clue as to one of the best albums of the last 50 years.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|This album by Tom Keifer is full of great songs that were well worth the wait of the release of his first solo album. If you are a fan of his music from past years you will not be dissapointed at all. I was lucky enough to see him on his first solo tour earlier this year and was impressed with the new material, but was still surprised with how good of a total album this is from start to finish. The songs don't stray too far from his past material while managing to sound current and in step with newer music. Great songwriting and a one of a kind voice make this a CD that I keep playing over and over.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie is a must see. I'm getting older, but honestly I wouldn't have traded growing up and getting to share in the nation's enthusiasm over Big Red, America's Racehorse. It was a once in a lifetime phenomenon that I would akin to Beatles' Mania-everyone watched the Belmont in anticipation of his win.<br /><br />Watching it almost 40 years later just captures the feeling all over again. Randall Wallace was the perfect person to direct this movie, Diane Keaton the perfect Penny, and maybe John Malkovich's best performance ever. I couldn't imagine anyone else being cast as Lucien Lauren.
193700788X|3.0|I think the title says it all. There are a lot of things I don't like about Charlene Harris' writing. That being said, if you don't expect much more out of the Sookie Stackhouse novels (contenders for the title of \\"Great American Novel\\" these aren't) than some light, fun airplane reading, you will enjoy this book about as much as the others. Dead Ever After isn't the best of the series, but it's not nearly as bad as some of the reviews by disgruntled fans would suggest. I was actually satisfied with the ending; it made sense based on who CH is and who (I think) she believes Sookie Stackhouse to be (and Sookie is her character, so I think we have to allow Ms. Harris to decide what happens to her). I do understand why some fans feel like it came out of nowhere; the last half or so of the book felt really rushed, a bit like Ms. Harris was trying to get the whole thing over with. I hope the coda is well-written. I think the book would have been better if the coda had been included as an epilogue.

B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I find this game to be fun and challenging.  For the most part it's really easy to pick up and play, the real challenge come when you attempt to get every star!!!  And for .99 cents you can't go wrong!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Never again will I buy a book by CH. Could an author hate her own characters and series more? Could an author be more bored and apathetic about her own creation?<br /><br />*EDIT*<br /><br />I was going to bump my rating up to a 2, just because the SVM books overall are awesome, but the more I think about this, the angrier I get. This was the very last book in a series that spanned over a decade. The book itself was SHORT with lots of BORING filler. I DON'T CARE if Sookie goes to WalMart, or talking about the tomatoes in her garden, or checking her email, BLAH BLAH BLAH. I don't care about Terry Belleflour or Tara or Arlene or Hoyt or Holly or Alcee Beck - especially if those sections are repetitive and without the Southern charm of the previous books. People read these because of the vampires, supernaturals, and the paranormal romances of Sookie/Bill, Sookie/Eric, Sookie/Alcide, Sookie/Quinn. That is what the fan-base was built on.<br /><br />Also, Charlaine Harris suddenly, for who knows what reason, changed the narrative to a third person point of view and it wasn't even coming from anyone anybody cares about! Why couldn't we hear the story from Eric or Pam or Bill (or even Jason, for crying out loud). These last 3 books are the worst of the lot - basically ever since Sookie broke her blood bond with Eric (talk about annoying), it's been a nosedive. But this one in particular is devastatingly bad!<br /><br />What she does to Eric is unforgivable. I'd rather he got staked. Why is this even called the Southern Vampire Mysteries anymore because the vampires are hardly in it, and when they are, they are not acting like the vampires we knew in the previous books.<br /><br />I have never used the phrase \\"phoned it in\\" before, but this is exactly what she did - or it wasn't even written by her. What is truly pathetic to me is the reaction of the media and Charlaine Harris sycophants. Everyone who doesn't love it is portrayed as a rabid Team Eric fanatic who is just bitter because Sookie didn't end up with Eric as a vampire. Forget the fact this book is written so poorly. It's all deranged fans who send death threats or are engaged in some internet bullying campaign to rig the Amazon ratings. It's unreal.<br /><br />This book could and should have been EPIC. Who cares who she ends up with? If it was written well and was explosive and fascinating, people would have loved it. But instead, we go out like this. MEH. I am starting to think Charlaine Harris just isn't talented enough to pull something like this off. She claims she wrote the best book she could. I think she just wanted to wash her hands of the whole thing. That's certainly what it appears.<br /><br />The HEA should have started building books ago. Instead, it's dumped in your lap in a matter of pages. Charlaine Harris cares more about describing Sookie cleaning her house than creating a believable relationship with the person who has always been a brother/friend figure.<br /><br />Do I wish Sookie would have ended up with Eric? Yes - and I'm not ashamed to say it (even though people are being basically bullied because they dare contradict what \\"the maker\\" - CH - wrote)! It was obvious who she would end up with. I mean, CH is not exactly a subtle writer. But she sure did milk the cash cow for the Eric/Sookie romance because the fans loved it and the books sold!<br /><br />No one should really be surprised in the long run. The writing was on the wall. Charlaine Harris just had to make sure Sookie would end up with someone she could be married, pregnant, and barefoot in the kitchen with. Only now, ironically, she is a bigot.<br /><br />What is most disappointing is that Sookie ended up right where she started. But worse, because now she knows there is so much more in the world, only now she rejects it. How could she ever truly live a happy life permanently stuck in Bon Temps. The vampires knowing about her telepathy ensured that Sookie would never live a \\"normal\\" life, for better or worse. The fresh-faced, nonjudgmental, spunky girl who was once open to new experiences is now back to square one. Only now she is jaded and ready to settle.<br /><br />Even though I will always love the first books and think they are truly wonderful, I still wholeheartedly give this \\"book\\" one star. I'll be re-reading through book 9 (maybe 10 every once in awhile) for years to come - and pretending the rest of them don't exist.<br /><br />Save your money! Or buy it to read just for closure and take it back. You will be an unhappy customer.etter or worse.

0517548232|5.0|Hazlitt points out fallacies in government policy:<br />encouraging consumerism confuses savings and investment with spending,<br />pretended entitlement benefits,<br />induced inflation,<br />monetary debasement,<br />ineffectual fiscal policy,<br />wasteful welfare,<br />corrupt taxation code,<br />misguided trade policy,<br />ineffectual protection of domestic industry,<br />wasteful agricultural subsidies,<br />excessive regulation and<br />misguided price control have been harming the American economy, reducing our international competitiveness and reducing our standard of living. Hazlitt writes with the forlorn hope that policies will change.<br /><br />It takes investment to grow economic cake size through productivity gains, government spending has proven ineffective. Economists employ sophistry to support government policies purporting to increase demand.<br />The multiplier fallacy is exposed, seen as the illusion of something for nothing.<br />Current taxes take resources out of the productive economy, with future taxes in the form of current borrowing deferring the subtraction to the future.<br />This includes the still sacrosanct Social Security payroll tax.<br />Machinery and technical innovation creates more jobs than it replaces.<br />The make work fallacy is exposed with the difference between full employment and full production.<br />Prevalence of union featherbedding does more harm than good.<br />A tariff reduces wages. As J.S. Mill showed economic gains are through imports not exports.<br />Scolding other countries is a particularly useless exercise.<br />Farm subsidies are shown to be counterproductive.<br />Saving an industry does a little good and a lot of harm.<br />As Hamilton said in the Federalist Papers 'Power over a man's subsistence amounts to power over his will.\\"<br />Rent control creates housing shortages and and minimum wages does harm in denying employment.<br />Price controls discourage employment.<br />Profits are necessary forcapital accumulation. Profit has become a dirty word even though it is reinvested profit that creates jobs.<br />Hazlitt deplores what he calls share the wealth charlatans who have turned us into a redistributive state.<br />Purchasing power parity and \\"just\\" wages are both fallacious as parity is set at arbitrary and adjustable levels.<br />Each generation follows an inflation mirage with the money illusion causing the public to feel richer. In reality inflation is a government ploy to deflate away debt. The poor are taxed by inflation to a greater degree than the rich.<br /><br />In attributing economic fallacies to Keynes, Hazlitt confuses economics with politics.<br />Keynes never advocated the permanent deficit spending attributed to him on both extremes of the political spectrum. The failures of Keynesian policy is a political failure resulting from liberals hijacking and perverting Keynes's ideas as cover for ideological programs. I can't see a single chapter in this book which Keynes might have argued with, except perhaps the slur on his legacy. Marx is also perhaps over simplified herein.<br /><br />At book's end, Hazlett wrongly predicts improvement in government policies. The most interesting aspect of this reading is why this Hazlitt common sense approach has been ignored in the USA since about 1965. The answer is probably that politics trumps economics.<br />It's very easy and lot's of fun to spend other people's money. The redistribution motive has been sold to the public under the guise of economic justice. Inflation is a free lunch for egalitarian minded politicians. Hazlitt didn't see the demographic changes where minority voters vote socialist. He didn't see the extent of the mindless altruism form of popular support for egalitarianism to empower collective government oligarchy. Our elected representatives no longer carry out the will of the people. The book has become somewhat irrelevant in spite of its clear-sightedness economic discernment.<br /><br />\\"The 'private sector' of the economy is, in fact, the voluntary sector; and the 'public sector' is, in fact, the coercive sector.\\"  ~ Henry Hazlitt
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Once again no chapter titles or number sequence, only alternating names of the two main characters.  I found this approach confusing in the prior releases, but because the time line needed to come together in this book, it worked better.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that all of these people kept finding each other wandering around by foot throughout the northeast US without any technology.<br /><br />I'm far from a young adult, the target audience for this series, but found it enjoyable.  I could see back to my book report days discussing comparisons and themes particularly in this last of the trilogy.  However it almost felt like the author was really pushing them in this book and trying to make a statement more than writing an enriched ending to the series.  For example:  [SPOILER ALERT] Hana felt responsible for Lena's and Alex's situation much in the same way Lena felt responsible for Julian's joining the cause and falling in love.  Both girls lives are placed side by side not for the benefit of the story so much as to force us to see that whether one had the procedure or not, they were much the same.<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT] As for the ending, what is up with that?  Ok you have Hana going through so much angst in this book trying to find out if she was normal for a post-procedure person.  And we almost believe that the procedure was not successful on her in the way she is questioning her match and taking care of people from her past.  And then wham, in the end it is like the procedure finally kicked in as she flip flops down the street to nowhere with nothing.  I could have accepted the ending for Lena, Alex, Julian, and her mother, but the last few pages of the author telling us how to live?  Ugh.  I would have preferred she tied up some of the loose ends and left the moral of the story to us to feel from the conclusion rather than the soapbox-like rant at the end.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars but the Hunger Games series was a more enjoyable read, and hope the final book in the Everneath trilogy ends better this January.<br /><br />Format: Borrowed ebookpe the final book in the Everneath trilogy ends better this January.<br /><br />Format: Borrowed ebook

B00CL0J99K|5.0|Note: I will update this review when I eventually get the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Since the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, things have been progressing quite nicely. It all started in 2008 with Tony Stark and his claim to fame as the fabled \\"Iron Man.\\" But when the universe eventually escalated into something much more massive by 2012's \\"The Avengers,\\" an interesting philosophical quandary was posed to the genius inventor by one Steve Rogers. Essentially, the question was, \\"does the man make the suit, or does the suit make the man?\\" The first film showed us Stark's reason and cause for dawning the armor after he realized his direct/indirect contribution to so much destruction around the world and felt the need to repent. The second film took it slightly further by showing how he dealt with the pressure of being a publicly-known superhero, how it affected him, both, physically and mentally, and asked what kind of legacy he wanted to leave behind. Conversely, it diverges about halfway through the story and, instead, starts to set the dominoes for \\"bigger and better\\" things, like S.H.I.E.L.D and the Avengers. In this third entry, we get the (final?) full-circle journey that, more or less, will come to establish Tony Stark/Iron Man as one or the other.<br /><br />Some time after the events of \\"The Avengers\\" we begin with a very restless Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who just can't seem to get a good night's sleep. As widely-known as he is for being Iron Man, and with all the major villains targeting his back, there exists a man by the name of The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), who is terrorizing the United States causing all kinds of chaos via public bombings and televised threats. After a dear friend of Stark's is severely injured, he takes the attack personally and issues a decree of vengeance. But in typical Tony Stark fashion, he not only paints himself another target, he even invites the trouble by publicly stating his home address. When his home is attacked,he barely escapes and must regroup in order to fight another day. In the meantime, secrets would be revealed and events would unfold as Stark discovers the truth, not only about his enemies, but also about himself.<br /><br />So how do you top \\"The Avengers?\\" After five excellent prequel films setting up a giant glorious spectacle of quasi-intergalactic proportions, there's nowhere left to go, but higher, right? Well, it depends. If you go by that logic, then you can only go further by making a direct sequel. But what would be the point of exceeding all that successful buildup by not trying to do it again? IM3 marks the beginning of Phase 2 by being less Avengers-centric (aside from a few event references) and by bringing things back down to earth. In doing so, we get to see Tony Stark for the genius, billionaire, playboy (well, not so much since he's with Pepper), philanthropist that he is. At a point in the film, and as obvious by the trailer, his house does, indeed, get blown to smithereens and buried in rubble. And being left with nothing but his ingenuity and resourcefulness, Stark must work his way back up from the ashes to stop a madman from manipulating the world with terror.<br /><br />And so far, based on the mixed reactions by divisive audiences, your expectations may or may not be met depending on what you're really watching the movie for (character development and storytelling or all-out action) and who you believe the true hero is, Tony Stark or Iron Man. I vehemently support the notion that Tony Stark is, without a doubt, the man that makes the suit. He didn't get however many umpteenth degrees in science and technology or create a mini Arc reactor from a box of scraps in a terrorist cave without showing some signs of intellectual capacity and a knack for building stuff. And for as little time as he spends inside of a suit, I think the film really cements him as a greater character than I would've ever expected. Tony Stark *is* Iron Man. He creates the suits, embraces his role, and finally comes to grips with his past.<br /><br />On a side note about the technical aspects, I saw this in 2D, as I'm not quite a believer in post-converted 3D films yet, so I can't tell you which version looks better. I will, however, give my compliments to the production crew on another excellent overall effort. The cinematography was pretty breathtaking on a few occasions (particularly when Stark is rescuing people from Air Force One) and and the final battle sequence with all the backup suits. Musically, Brian Tyler does an equally stupendous job driving the film with a mix between Ramin Djawadi's electronic style of the first film and John Debney's traditional orchestral sound of the second. And whether or not they make more IM films, which I think could be overkill at this point, remains to be seen. But I'm confident enough to say Tony Stark is ready for Phase 2 when it happens. Hopefully, the remaining MCU films will do just as great a job at expanding/establishing these characters and continuing to build up for an even more climactic meeting for when things fall into place for \\"The Avengers 2.\\"<br /><br />Overall rating: 4.5/5.0

B0042X9L6A|5.0|I purchased my SB-700 two years ago at BH photo in NYC. I could not be happier. Dollar for dollar I think it is the best Nikon flash around. I now have a Nikon SB-910 in the kit and while I don't regret the purchase as it is a fabulous flash, and as others have mentioned it has a bit more power, I think the extra $200 dollars would better be spent towards another SB-700. I can only speak for my shooting style but I seldom need the full power pop from the 910 so the extra power while nice in the limited instances I need it would probably be made up for with a second and close to a third SB-700 for the price. This would open up even more options. I have added the Pocket Wizard FlexTT5 transceivers to the mix and the SB-700 performs perfectly. As though it was mounted on the camera with full control from both a D7000 and a D800 through flash compensation. I have lit entire gymnasium widths for dozens of people and not been dissatisfied. I think the biggest highlight for me is the battery life. I use three sets of Rayovac ni-mh AA in them and I can shoot for hours on a single set. I have only run into the thermal slow down a couple times and the use of the pocket wizards has eliminated that as it can cycle intelligently between two speedlights to beat the off occasion I have run into this.<br /><br />Update: I have since purchased another one and I love it. I don't have the need for the sync port or external power packs so I am avoiding the SB-900. I would rather buy one of these and another PocketWizard FlexTT5 than an SB-900. This fits my workflow. I work with photographers that wouldn't trade their 900s for anything.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|The sheer amount of content they added to P4G compared to the original is huge. they even modified things like the appearance of  the shadows to look better.<br /><br />If you are new to Persona, this might be the best game to jump in, as it allows more customization and control compared to the others.<br /><br />P4G is a J-RPG that has turn-based combat, though the game is much more focused on the characters and your interaction with them than the combat, even if the combat feels much more different than most other J-RPGs, where it is much more &#34;high-risk high-rewards&#34;.<br /><br />The game is quite long as well, with a single playthrough easily taking 100 hours or so if you want to try to experience as much as possible of the game.<br /><br />I must say though, I would go as far as considering P4G the best J-RPG I have ever played in terms of the sheer amount of enjoyment I got out of the game.<br /><br />So, if you like J-RPGs, or already are a fan of the Persona series, this game is definately a system seller in my opinion. P4G is an absolutely ginormous game that was beautifully put together and is a stellar example of how to do re-makes properly.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I never found a boring part of this book.  The pacing was perfect.  The world, although not fully explained, is full of magic and the unexpected.  The characters are witty, interesting, and genuine although, at times, too similar to each other.  This similarity can be forgiven considering that we're reading about the major players of this world, all driven and powerful for their own reasons.<br /><br />What got me is that Amazon offered this up for $3 and I took the bait only to find out the next book is some time off.  I normally won't start an incomplete series as I'm not patient but I am making sure this series is set to arrive at my doorstep as it's published.

I wanted more Eric and Bill I hated that it was not more resolved with Bill although he has been getting on my nerves for like 3 books now!!! I was sad with Eric and quite frankly pist off with his ending he was one of the main reasons I read and followed this series...I mean come on its ERIC!!! How could Harris do that to him After all the Sookie and Eric Drama you just write him off in a few pages..I was devastated my heart heart hurt for Eric....I wasn't super  happy with Sookie's choice ..I always known  she would end up with (Sam) He was always there ALWAYS...so at least I was right about that..but their ending fell short, I hate to feel cheated after 13 books...I wanted a peek into their lives I guess casue what I saw  was kinda boring ...I just feel like instead of creating more problems for Sookie in this book I wish she would have wrapped it up and showed us more of all of their futures...I know it sounds crazy but man you read and follow a series like this you feel so attached to all the characters and I am just sad dang it!!!! I want to know what happened after I finished reading it...I wanted to feel more resolved.Not left wanting to know more..UGGGHHHH..I REALLY WANTED ERIC TO TURN HER AND THAT WAS THAT and for Sookie to KILL  Fredya..I mean who wants someone who does not want you..I will force him to marry me for 200 YEARS..UGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

B008N9AAQ4|3.0|The emotional power of Samsara could have been at least up to par with Baraka but I was not moved emotionally. The visuals of Samsara are great just like Baraka. There are scenes and sequences that are similar to Baraka. The term Samsara from what I know is a Buddhist term of the cycle of birth and death. There are only a few moments in Samsara that parallels that. I still liked this film even though it did not fill my spiritual/visual hunger unlike Baraka. So I would consider Samsara as a side project of Baraka rather than another movie by Ron fricke.

It was so emotional, and makes you want to watch it till the end.<br />It got me crying at many moments, and those moments got me to imagine if the same situation happened to me and my love. But anyway, Will Smith was the perfect actor for this movie.<br />What I didn't like is that the \\"monsters\\" are not really shown if they were vampires or zombies. They look more like zombies, but ones that avoid the day light. But despite this and other minor things I didn't like, the greatness of the movie makes you ignore all the cons & just focus on whats gonna happen next.

'No Easy Day' is the only one that I decided to read due to author's media appearances and his 'credibility' when recalling the mission. The book is very fast paced, easy to read and packed with nuggets of information that can be valuable to both informed and uninitiated readers. I'd recommend this book to those who are interested in learning about that monumental night and those who want to learn about the sacrifices that elite members of the US military do to keep the world safe for all of us. 5/5

I won't spoil it for anyone but I love Gideon and Eva. After completing this book I have a better understanding of both characters. I was glad he opened up to her, because she desperately needed it.

Then when I clicked for it to find a printer it found it on its own and it was ready.  All I had to do then was click print and out the document came.  I have to say I am liking my kindle more and more every day.
B0050PYNP8|1.0|Ultimately, I just turned it off. I was not offended by the agendas as much as by the lack of creative writing and the overdone, repetitive use of obscenities to mask said lack of creative writing. The premise sounded like fun, but this one is really a close encounter of the tired kind.<br /><br />It's your time, so use it as you wish, but I found I had better things to do with mine.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I look forward my  Downton Abbey times.  I didn't start watching it at first so I am watching it on Amazon Instant Videos.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves history with a little romance added in.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I like being able to access this dictionary when I come across a stumper of a word.  Makes the Kindle even better when you can get an ap like this.
B000W4D94I|4.0|I saw this in a theater when it was first released.  The roaring of the tornadoes made it seem as if they were ripping right through the theater.  Subsequent viewings on DVD (and now Blu-ray) haven't managed to recapture the initial experience, which was utterly, terrifyingly LOUD.<br /><br />Almost a perfect disaster flick, Twister, nonetheless, suffers from a flawed script/story, which was manhandled by numerous writers (including Joss Whedon).  The only time the movie is riveting is when there is a tornado on screen.  The rest is pure melodrama, the tedious affair/triangle of weatherman Bill Harding (Bill Paxton), his new girlfriend/fianc&eacute;e (Jami Gertz), and his estranged wife Dr. Jo Harding (Helen Hunt).  How or why this putz wants a divorce is never made clear, throughout the film he and his wife half-heartedly snipe at one another as though that alone constituted grounds for divorce.  It's an inconvenient distraction the story didn't require.  Wasn't braving tornadoes danger/excitement enough?  The second complication comes from a smart-alecky pseudo-scientist Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes).  He appears, on cue, as a minor irritant (never a rival storm chaser).  Not once do they depict actual competition between the two factions.  Both have almost identical equipment (DOROTHY and DOT), yet the only group we see struggling to get it up and working is the group led by Hunt & Paxton.  Trying to introduce Elwes as a potential enemy/patent thief is laughable at best.  He smirks a couple of times, that's the extent of his malice.  He is a toothless villain.  You would think, with the number of writers involved, one of them would have realized all this extraneous material was unnecessary, they had the perfect vehicle in the storms themselves.  Everything else just wastes time.<br /><br />Standouts among the cast were Philip Seymour Hoffman, Alan Ruck, and the always reliable Lois Smith as Aunt Meg.  Helen Hunt, of course, rises well above the subject matter.  (It was also nice to see Bill Paxton toned down for a change.)also nice to see Bill Paxton toned down for a change.)
B00BSWMITK|3.0|There's some great musicianship on this cd. But the songs aren't as strong as I would expect from Satch. I suppose the standouts for me are Can't Go Back, A Door Into Summer, and the title track. I keep hoping for another Surfing quality cd and I keep not getting it. Anyway Joe is a monster player and the band are all virtuosos in there own rite. Maybe it will grow on me. A cfew standout tracks and a lot of filler songs IMO.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Very good historical perspective. But as historical movies go, its kinda boring. I never walk out of a movie, or not finish one, but i struggled to get through this. Maybe when im old and bored again, I will find this to be a better story.<br /><br />don't spend your money on it. PIRATE

193700788X|1.0|When this series began, I started to read it, mainly because I felt (at the time) the story had the author's heart/soul in it.<br /><br />There was a mature build up, a reason why the characters were the way they were, and a direction (which I would hope) the future novels/stories would progress into.<br /><br />So many years later, I hate to say I am highly disappointed.<br /><br />The main reason: The author lost or either sold her soul, along with her characters, and the stories to the highest bidder.<br /><br />In my humble words/opinion; she started to let others influence the way she was bringing up her child(ren).<br /><br />Yes, these stories were hers, but maybe (I just can't be sure), it was the all the attention that she was finally receiving for her written work.<br /><br />It could of been all the fame that a show named after 'her babies' (or close to, since the show is based on her books) had finally gotten, after years of working, very hard on all of them.<br /><br />Maybe it could of been all of the money offered, to churn out more books, after the TV show was in full swing.<br /><br />There are billions of reasons why the author could/would of finally made the last book 'a disappointment', in the end.<br /><br />Maybe she was just tired of it all.<br /><br />\\"Fame is not what its cracked up to be, so I heard it said.\\"<br /><br />I have a feeling we never might not know.<br /><br />My thoughts are this: You gave up on your children (book/novels), all to soon, and when you write, I know that these writers want to be paid for their works...who doesn't...but they should not give up their souls in the process.<br /><br />I hope the author will take some time off (for herself), and realize this, before she starts another series.<br /><br />Just my two cents; now off the soap box...for now.
0345803493|5.0|I loved reading this book mainly because it was very different from what I'm used to reading. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved it! This book is good for all ages. I do recommend this book to people who are highly appreciative.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This is a great, light read for when you're on vacation or laying out on the beach or anytime. I was laughing out loud many times. I'm reading all the Kinsella novels now. Emma Corrigan is very endearing and sweet, and the story is very unpredictable.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I really like it. it's exactly what I wanted for my own personal use at home when I am practicing my guitar. Thank you. fast delivery too.
B000OIZUW6|2.0|I was quite disappointed with this book. Being a Ken Follet fan, I was expecting something at least cleverly written. I have read the Pillars of the Earth series, the two written books of the Century series, and &#34;The Eye of the Needle&#34;, and enjoyed all of them (in that order).<br /><br />&#34;Jackdaws&#34; felt rushed, and I almost got the idea he wrote it for a paycheck rather then enjoyment. The story line was clever, but it was predictable and felt forced. The character development left much to be wanted, and was quite stereotypical. The worst, and my pet peeve in literature, was the unrealistic dialogue. The interaction between the characters was dry, cliche, and unrealistic. The plot left many holes, but by the time I got to them I just wanted the book to be over. The only reason I finished it was because I was stuck on a flight and this was my only entertainment.<br /><br />Save your time and money, and read something good Mr. Follet has written.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game has beautiful colors.  It is very addicting.  As the levels increase you also encounter educational bits on ocean life.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Metallica has always been a cut above over groups in their progress and development as artists. S&M takes it to an entirely new level.
193700788X|5.0|I am so tired of all these negative ninnies trashing this book.  This series ended the way I had always secretly (and not so secretly) wanted.  I am very happy with the whole situation.  The only thing I'm sad about is that I read it to danged fast.  Can't wait to see what is in store for other characters in the future in After Dead in October.  Thank You, Charlaine Harris for reigniting my love of reading so many years ago now.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Hard at times but still fun. The game was very sexy and I love it. The levels hard as you go a long
B00BOUL9DM|2.0|I downloaded this app after having played several other similar games. At first it seemed ok. as good as the other apps. But then after playing up to like level 80 and leaving the game when I went back in later it sent me back to level 40. It has done this 4 times. The only good thing about this is I already knew all the answers and I earned points for every redo. Also I had gotten stuck on a word so I purchased some coins AND I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN THEM. Stay away from this version.
B002RI9ZQ8|3.0|I expected so much more from this book.<br />I enjoyed the mystery section, but this did not get going until about 100 pages in and was solved with about another 100 pages still to go. What filled these pages was, I think, meant to set the scene for the other two books in the trilogy, but in this book it was unnecessary and created a feeling of anti-climax.<br />I was also irritated by the author's, translator's and editor's apparent inability to use past tenses properly, particularly the pluperfect.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I wore through two copies of this book.  It's my summer tradition to read this book again.  Now that I have it on kindle I don't/shouldn't have to worry about buying another copy. It's much different than the movie and a MUST read for all pagan's everywhere!!

B0054TVW04|5.0|This fascinating look into Western Civilization by Niall Ferguson is certain to ruffle some feathers. It is bound to raise controversy. Ferguson asks the question that can't be asked. The question that must never be asked in our modern world: Why did Western Civilization come to dominate the rest of the world in the last 500 years? After all, five hundred years ago a betting man would have looked at puny Europe and compared it with the powerful Moslem world and the vast Chinese realm and scoffed at the idea that the Europeans would have come to dominate. What caused this? The stock answer today is colonialism. That is of course nonsense. After all the Islamic world was built oni colonialism. China was a vast empire. Why were they not ascendant?<br /><br />Ferguson comes up with the answer. Western Civilization developed six concept, what he calls \\"killer applications\\" that allowed it to grow and dominate. These \\"killer applications\\" are competition, science, democracy, medicine, consumerism, and the work ethic. He goes into great detail about each of these concepts, how they developed, and why the lack of these \\"killer applications\\" or their underuse lead to the other world powers drop at the same time that the West began to rise. There is some fascinating material here. I am sure that many will argue against Ferguson's points, but the ability to debate and discus such concepts freely is itself a mark of the West.<br /><br />One of the things that I like about this book is that it eschews any racial nonsense. The West did not become superior due to any superiority on the part of Western man. Rather it became superior because of it's ideas. He shows that as nations begin to adopt these ideas they begin to grow. The ascendency in our own time of China is in many ways related to the slow acceptance of these ideas. This is an excellent book and deserves a reading.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Scyfy channel started showing these and I loved it but soon realized they were out of order.  I was so pleased to see that I can watch  them on Amazon prime in order.  I am almost through season one and I'm planning to watch them all.  Great series for scifi fans like me. I hook up my kindle fire hd to my television and they look beautiful.

B000WC3AJE|2.0|I have these three movies on DVD.  I found the Blu-ray set extremely disappointing because the graininess of older movies is far worse than I have ever seen on anything.  I have read about this problem with old fim transfers, but I have seen many very old movies, including this set of 3, on TCM and DVD, that do not have a problem at all.  Often they are very impressive, looking like they were filmed yesterday.  I am left wondering if this is some rip-off company that produced these.  Surely MGM would not be proud of this offering.  I would never recommend it to anyone.
B00B0NDF26|4.0|This album is the first I've ever listened to from this band. Though I had never heard of them, I decided to listen to them on a whim at a friends house. To my surprise, I actually liked them! I was doubly surprised to be told that they were not all that new but have been around for quite some time.<br />Don't let the upbeat tempo of the songs fool you. The lyrics are deep and the writing is top notch. I'm big at melodramatic music, emo and alternative rock that borders on the depressing, but they put the pop in sad overtures.<br />Def a gem and looking forward to listening to there entire past library. :)
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|It came in early & there were no scratches. It was perfect. This a really nice romantic/ tragical movie. I recommend
B000MTOLDG|4.0|Ok, i just heard bastards and after so many years i can say that i really like Burner and the first half of the songs, but there´s some filler songs in the end......SACRIFICE and OVERNIGHT SENSATION are way way better...Still is Motörhead, and you may enjoy it!!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|You won't see infinite, procedurally-generated worlds here.  Limited to maybe a few cells, no caves or dungeons, and no Nether or dragons.  Block art can still be a good way to kill some time, tho- controls are surprisingly nice.<br /><br />But if you want the real Minecraft experience, drop $20 on the PC version- it's well worth it.
B000294SFW|5.0|That´s true!!! From the many great albums from the legend MOTÖRHEAD, i think INFERNO is among the best!!!!!! in fact, i really like most everything LEMMY created with his mates, but INFERNO is really inspired.....ALL IN THE NAME OF TRAGEDY, TERMINAL SHOW, DOWN ON ME, IN THE BLACK and fight are MOTÖ pearls!!!!! WELL DONE, MOTÖRHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Bought this soon after I received my KF 7&#34; for Christmas 2012.  Several months later, it's performed its first real save after a drop onto a sidewalk, and has kept my device pristine while looking good doing it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Small- the device still fits in many pockets with this case on, and feels good in the hands.<br />- Simple styling- so many garish and gaudy cases out there; this is not one of those.<br />- Screen cover can be folded completely flat to the back, or positioned as a stand.  Good for reading or videos.<br />- Elastic strap can hold cover open or closed- I see a lot of cases with no way to secure the cover in either position.<br />- Has proven its durability and protectiveness so far!  Just a few scratches on the case, none on the device, and it does see a lot of use.<br /><br />Cons<br />- No room for a stylus.<br />- Only one stand position, unlike cases I've come across since.<br />- Elastic strap has stretched and frayed a bit.<br /><br />Overall, a solid investment.
B000002HJA|5.0|CIRCUS LEAVES TOWN is the last album from the amazing gifted band KYUSS...Their 4 albums are ALL great, filled with HEAVY ROCK pearls....I totally recommend all the stuff from KYUSS.......KYUSS RULES!!!!!!!!!!

They stay among the greatest ROCK ever besides the kings LED ZEPPELIN and DOORS!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005P9SLES|5.0|Wasn't sure if they could pull this off - compared to the original - but have done so.  Getting to know the team - with all their uniqueness has been a pleasure.  Just a fun show to watch.
B001AKTZPA|5.0|I really like ALL the stuff from this magic legendary ROCK band, but this one, GREEN RIVER must be my favourite from a sequence of masterpieces!!!! The title track, COMMOTION, BAD MOON RISING, LODI....WOW!!!! What a beautiful powerful ROCK PIECE!!!!! AMAZING!!!!!!

B0083I90HU|4.0|For the first half of Sarah's Key, I was convinced I would give this 5 stars: I was gripped by the awful power of this tragic story and de Rosnay's extremely skillful telling. However, with two protagonists (Sarah and Julia) it was inevitable that I would be more captivated by one than the other. Julia's story was strong, but it just couldn't compete with Sarah's.  Without wishing to give anything away, I began to lose interest around the time Julia visited the US and I found the plot and pacing of the later chapters to be more put-downable than before. This is still an incredibly strong book and I would thoroughly recommend reading it; it just didn't quite hold me until the end.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|The debut from THE DOORS is a anthologic classic amazing masterpiece that changed the music history forever....it comes before LED ZEPPELIN and DEEP PURPLE, transforming the ROCK scene with immortal pearls like BREAK ON THROUGH, THE END, TAKE IT AS IT COMES, ALABAMA SONG and BACK DOOR MAN!!!!! While i really like ALL the DOORS albums, this debut may be their best collection of songs!!!!!TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
0060763280|4.0|It was used and smashed oh well I bought it for 25 cent It was perfect for the cheap price
B000001A3H|5.0|BLUES FOR RED SUN is a AMAZING ALBUM!!!! All the songs are great.....KYUSS is a gifted HEAVY ROCK band and ALL their stuff is TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!

0316017930|4.0|In this book titled Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell, he discusses the stories of success of famous people. The author emphasizes that you do not need to be rich or smart, but that timing is everything. For example, Gladwell talks about Canadian Ice Hockey players. Most of the players in the advanced leagues were born in January. The last cutoff to enter this league in Canada was January 1st. The boy that has a birthday on January 2nd will be seen as super talented and may be get the chance to go to a more advanced team. Thus, leading him to a faster path of success. Many of our greatest successors started from the bottom and worked their way up. This book gives people hope that they too can become a better person and achieve greatness. All you have to do is plan out everything and when the time is right it will all come together.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am so sad and angry that this is the way the author chose to end this otherwise fantastic series.  Her writing is not good, the characters are not themselves and it's a terrible end to a good story.  Why would Ms Harris want her story to end on a note like this?  Don't waste your money.  Keep your memories positive and just remember the other books.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|I found this book really easy to read. It would have been nice to have the initial soul-selling premise explained in more detail, it kind of felt like it was just thrown in there without making much sense. The reason for wanting Sookie dead was a bit weak, but I guess that was tied in with the soul-loss changing them. It seemed like nearly everyone that Sookie knew was in the book at some stage and some of that felt a bit forced, but overall it worked.<br /><br />Edit: Wow have just read a bunch of the other reviews. So puzzled by these reactions! Not sure why people would want Sookie to be with Eric who is not a good guy. I'm really pleased she ended up with someone NICE who won't get her caught up in politics and intrigue all the time. Isn't that exactly what she's always wanted?
B00C2VGAW2|4.0|This is a great soundtrack, but make sure you compare the track listings from this version and the Deluxe version.  The Deluxe, while about $3 more, contains 6 more tracks, including \\"Imagine Me and You\\" by the xx and the Florence + the Machine songs.  In my haste, I did not read the track listings or search for an additional version, so if you're looking for those songs, you may be disappointed with this version.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I actually really love this game. its super fun. I could spend hours on it, that is, if there were enough levels. there are five worlds, ten levels in each. we had to buy the game, but if you want to buy more characters that's one to three dollars, and to buy more levels its another dollar. cant they just give us all of them for free? I mean, we already spent the buck getting the game.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I love the song same love. It's a beautiful piece speaking for gay rights. And I love Macklemore for this.

B009YP9L7U|2.0|The marks for editing were still showing, like this was a word processing paper. That was annoying. The male character seemed more abusive and manipulative than sexy. Really, writers need to notice that love isn't a miraculous substitute therapy.

1475143389|5.0|I purchased this book on Kindle primarily for my son who is trying to add muscle weight.  I found this book very informative and useful. It offers specific sets of exercises with scheduling suggestions and specific types of supplements that are useful for gaining weight.  My son did lift weights, but the gains were very slow.  As a result of this program, he gained 3 pounds the very first week.  I do believe that many people who hit the gym give up because they are not seeing the results they desire.  The suggested exercises use free weights versus machines and they did not require long hours in the gym daily. The results seem to come much quicker using Mr. Matthews approach.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|this game is pretty cool but the controls can be confusing and it takes lots of space.  I rate it 4 stars.
1480111724|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moTDZV1OXLSXGX]]FROM DOWN THE CENTURIES<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Brian Harris has brought together an intriguing series of stories from the legal world which he has rightly called \\"Tales from the Courtroom\\" and which involve many very important and courageous decisions from the past.<br /><br />To many some of these stories will be very familiar but to others they are new as precedent setters. The book is very easy to read and a pleasure to read because of Brian's splendid use of English throughout.  It is one which all those considering a legal career should read for the background it gives as to how the common law has developed down the ages.<br /><br />Some years ago there were a number of books available which we read like Megarry's Miscellany-at-Law volumes which contained a wise and witty series of judicial pronouncements. Then there was Glanville Williams' undergraduate tutorial on how to be a lawyer entitled `Learning the Law' which many of us were brought up on as law students. These books combined a heavier approach to the courtroom with the occasional and grateful anecdote.<br /><br />\\"Tales from the Courtroom\\" is somewhat different for the twenty-first century because it brings together so many different aspects of courtroom life from the sad to the extraordinary.<br /><br />The beauty of Brian's special book on courtroom cases is the light touch he adopts throughout when the telling of the tales.  As lawyers we like recounting the unusual things which sometimes go on, and the varied characters we meet or represent during our careers.<br /><br />Many books from Slapper's \\"Weird Cases\\" to the allegedly highly fictional `Rumpole' or `Roger Thursby', or `Albert Haddock' from a different age have their own places and \\"Tales from the Courtroom\\" is just fit for the modern legal age of the early twenty-first century.<br /><br />The budding law undergraduate should not be without this book because these tales are an essential tool of our trade albeit general but important characteristics of the law which are raised here.<br /><br />We have always believed that a study of the history of English Law and what has made the common law what it is today comes from what some cynics call `legal war stories' but which are actually what the profession is really about (not gossip but discussion!) otherwise why bother with the dining at the Inns or any form of socializing.<br /><br />This is a serious book which does not at any stage pontificate but it just brings together so many strands of human life and achievement from within the law set in one source book- Brian Harris has achieved the impossible here by bringing to lawyer and lawman alike the diversity which every matter brings to the fore in a court of law.  Thank you, Brian.e without this book because these tales are an essential tool of our trade albeit general but important characteristics of the law which are raised here.<br /><br />We have always believed that a study of the history of English Law and what has made the common law what it is today comes from what some cynics call `legal war stories' but which are actually what the profession is really about (not gossip but discussion!) otherwise why bother with the dining at the Inns or any form of socializing.<br /><br />This is a serious book which does not at any stage pontificate but it just brings together so many strands of human life and achievement from within the law set in one source book- Brian Harris has achieved the impossible here by bringing to lawyer and lawman alike the diversity which every matter brings to the fore in a court of law.

B000VDDDVO|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  I always looked forward to watching it every Christmas season.  However, these last few years, I never seemed to see it being shown on TV anymore.  This year, I decided I wouldn't be at the mercy of the TV schedulers anymore, and I would buy my own copy.  I am glad I did.  I am also glad I got the set that includes the colorized version, too.  This version is done very well, and doesn't look strange the way the first colorized movies looked when this technique first began.  If there is anyone out there who hasn't seen this movie, I highly recommend it!  Merry Christmas!!

He said in the Preface to this 2006 book, \\"I am sure... that there are lots of people out there who have been brought up in some religion or other, are unhappy in it, don't believe it... but just don't realize that leaving is an option. If you are one of them, this book is for you. It is intended to raise consciousness... to the fact that ... You can be an atheist who is happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled.\\" (Pg. 1)<br /><br />After reviewing Einstein's conceptions of God, he comments, \\"I wish that physicists would refrain from using the word God in their specific metaphorical sense. The metaphorical or pantheistic God of the physicists is light years away from the interventionist, miracle-wreaking, thought-reading, sin-punishing, prayer-answering God of the Bible... Deliberately to confuse the two is, in my opinion, an act of intellectual high treason.\\" (Pg. 19) Later, he adds, \\"the deist God is certainly an improvement over the monster of the Bible. Unfortunately it is scarcely more likely that he exists, or ever did.\\" (Pg. 46)<br /><br />He clarifies, \\"I shall define the God Hypothesis more defensibly: there exists a superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us. This book will advocate an alternative view: any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.\\" (Pg. 31)<br /><br />He states, \\"This conclusion is so surprising, I'll say it again. If the odds of life originating spontaneously on a planet were a billion to one against, nevertheless that stupefyingly improbable event would still happen on a billion planets. The chance of finding any one of those billion life-bearing planets recalls the proverbial needle in a haystack. But ... any beings capable of looking must necessarily be sitting on one of those prodigiously rare needles before they even start the search.\\" (Pg. 138) He adds, \\"however small the minority of evolution-friendly planets may be, our planet necessarily has to be one of them\\" (Pg. 141), and \\"the present universe has to be one of that minority, because we are in it.\\" (Pg. 145)<br /><br />He also suggests, \\"The key difference between the genuinely extravagant God hypothesis and the apparently extravagant multiverse hypothesis is one of statistical improbability. The multiverse, for all that it is extravagant, is simple. God, or any intelligent, decision-taking, calculating agent, would have to be highly improbable in the very same statistical sense as the entities he is supposed to explain. The multiverse may seem extravagant in sheer NUMBER of universes. But if each one of those universes is simple in its fundamental laws, we are still not postulating anything highly improbable. The very opposite has to be said of any kind of intelligence.\\" (Pg. 148-149)<br /><br />He admits, \\"there's no denying that, from a moral point of view, Jesus is a huge improvement over the cruel ogre of the Old Testament. Indeed Jesus, if he existed (or whoever wrote his script if he didn't) was surely one of the great ethical innovators of history. The Sermon on the Mount is way ahead of its time.\\" (Pg. 250)<br /><br />Dawkins' book is written so as to be deliberately provocative, of course, so opinions about it will be wildly divergent. I would simply suggest that one read it for oneself before forming any opinion.ertheless that stupefyingly improbable event would still happen on a billion planets.

B009NY43NY|2.0|Well I waited a full year to be disapointed. Yes I saw the spoilers for the book, I just had to read it for myself(and I had pre ordered it months ago).<br />Ms Harris really dropped the ball on this book. The characters did not feel the same. Eric became a big wuss, which never happend in any other book.Yes he set things up to protect Sookie, but he never would have just gone to OK.<br /> Sookie would never have just jumped on Sam so quickly after Eric left. She always took it slow, so why so fast now?<br />It never explained how Sam got out of his promise to Eric to not court Sookie.<br />This book has so many inconsistancies in it that it is clear Charlaine Harris was tired of Sookie and the gang and just wanted it over.  Personally I have read better in fan fiction and will continue to do so as the plots are much better.<br />I am a finish the series no matter what Kind of person and I will read the final book on how they all turned out, but will wait to borrow it, not buy it. I believe Ms. Harris could have done much better with this book. It's a shame she didn't try harder.
0345529057|2.0|When I started reading this series I thought it was the best thing I'd read in a long time. Ultimately it was a huge disappointment. The author seems to be good creating the anticipation of great clashes to come between powerful conflicting interests, but then doesn't deliver. (spoilers ahead) Arya trains and trains and then does nothing. Dragons grow and grow, getting scarier and scarier, and then fly away. Winter is coming and coming and never comes. This kind of thing happens over and over. Very often what seems like an important protagonist simply dies. The author will build anticipation in one thread, end this thread with a fizzle, and then start building anticipation in another thread. I don't know if he enjoys building anticipation and then dashing it, or if he writes without any idea where he's headed, and then simply can't deliver a satisfactory payoff. I do know it's ultimately irritating.
B004K00NMG|5.0|Although most of the people review the movie, the characters , the story-line. I felt compelled to help some people by deciding if the blu ray version of this movie is right for them. Let start by saying that I collect all of Don Bluth animated classics, but whatever opinion you have about the movie itself, I respect. Not everyone can be pleased by the story-line selected by a director on any of old times classic tales. But as a collector that buys the blu blu ray versions of such tales, I expect that at least some special restoration is done in the video transfer to be worth the upgrade. Well that restoration is excellent for this movie. All other Don Bluth blu rays video transfers are awful. So this is my opinion of the video quality of the classics:<br /><br />Anastasia: 5 STARS<br />All Dogs go to heaven: 1 STAR<br />All Dogs go to heaven 2: 0 STARS (if Possible)<br />The secret of Nimh: 1 STAR<br />Thumbelina: 1 STAR<br />Fergully: 1 STAR<br />The pebble and the Pinguin: 1 STAR
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|Best game ever including the levels. It's  challenging but I love taking a challenge. Also the gear and bikes you can buy are cool but is to much money
B008XG1X18|5.0|Lovr it! I love having all my stuff saved in one place. Instant shortcut to anything I need. I am COMPLETELY addicted.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I get anxious playing it and can't get anywhere - better for kids, I can't react fast enough to score well
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|just like the last f****d up my kf!  what is it with these apps.  maybe I got a bunk kf.
B005HSL626|3.0|get bored after awhile, doesn't seem to be challenging to me - maybe now what I expected to do yet
B001IB63J2|4.0|This product was ordered by my 11 year old grandson with my permission. The only thing is that it can only be played via a 33rpm record player which he does not have. I E-mailed you to see if you have in a more current type like for the I-pod.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Firstly this game's graphics is pretty advanced. It is a good to see that it works on the original kindle fire just fine. Secondly, this game is huge download 580 MB and almost a Gigabyte when installed. Please be aware that the original kindle fire has too little memory space for apps like these and I had to remove a lot of apps and other stuff from the user data (sdcard) before I could successfully install this on the original Kindle fire. Thirdly, This ain't Temple run just like most of you say. Yes it is a 'runner' of some sorts but mostly flying precariously close to land at times you have to use your fingers to fight off the bosses.<br /><br />Comparing this with Temple Run might be little too much. I like Temple Run a lot and there is no doubt that this Iron Man 3 game's graphics is darn too good but the time it takes to restart the game or a new mission is just too frustrating. The wait between missions while your suit gets ready for battle and the load times spoils the interest.<br /><br />Having said, For a free game this indeed very good. But I would not compare this with Temple Run.<br /><br />Please do not hate me - 3 Stars from me.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|Really fun story. I love that the author did his research. I'm hooked. Can't wait to read the next one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book grabs you by your heart strings and drags you into an intense love story of two young adults whose cancer stricken bodies are their own worst enemies. With a dramatic twist of events you find that your heart is caught between loving the book and wishing that someone would take a dagger to your now shattered heart and end the misery. John Green not only brings to life the struggles of love and illness but proves to us all that some books bring you to an entirely different world and while it is heartbreaking you would rather stay there forever then move an inch away!
193700788X|1.0|I REFUSE to buy or read this!! REFUSE!!! Charlaine Harris KNEW the majority of her fans read this book series because WE ALL LOVED ERIC AND SOOKIE!!! KNEW IT!!! And did she care? No. She just wrote what she wanted. Why give us years and years, book after book, story line after story line of one of the greatest romances of all time to end it with ***spoliers**** Eric marrying his vampire wife and banded from Sookie for 200 years and putting Sookie with a man she had only friendship feelings for for 13 books? What the hell was the point to giving us Sookie and Eric if in the last freaking book they were completely ripped away from us.<br /><br />We are supposed to TRUST our favorite authors to take us on a journey, make us sad, cry, rejoice, smile, want to pull out our hair, fall in love with our favorite characters and in the end know it was a hellva good ride. This feels like betrayel. Like we were conned. The hood pulled over our eyes.  She took us on an epic journey with Sookie and Eric. Then cheated on us with Sam.  WTF.<br /><br />I'll never trust her with a story again and I won't be reading anything else this author writes.<br /><br />*note- I did try to read a borrowed copy but couldn't make myself do it. Just read some parts of it.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|John Green is amazing, the story line is awesome and it is an easy but interesting read! I suggest it to everyone!
B004SRWW0C|4.0|Phone:<br />Droid X<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Does what it's supposed to<br />- batch, &#34;multi-select&#34;<br />- copy, paste<br />- create new folders<br />- bookmarks<br />- extract, move<br />- create new files<br />- Works extremely well<br />- Best file manager for android<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Price is a little high
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This was a gift for my grandson and he has no complains and is enjoying watching these movies.So it is a good product and was delivered to me on time as promised.
B00999DFP0|1.0|I bought this set for my daughter for her birthday, as she loves this show. When she watched them the discs were scratched and after some further looks at the set it is clear that the set is pirated. The images on the inside of the discs is fuzzy, as if printed off a regular printer at home. Very disappointing. Not sure why amazon is allowing this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wasn't as raunchy as I heard. Had a good story line. Moved very fast and was well worth the read. Kind of sad it's over. Every love should be a small challenge!!!
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|juck!!!  Yuck!  What a waste .  Whoever thought this would be fun was our of his mind. I am sosrry I wasted my time with it.
1573228737|1.0|There is a glaring phantom in this book, all right - that of a polished technique, for the two narratives presented, although by different persons, sound just the same: sloppy, garish and, overall, irksome. Then, in lieu of keenly drawn characters and a straight, absorbing chronicle, we have dismal portrayals of women whose bizarre affair will mangle what could have been a slick, spooky tale.<br /><br />My verdict: if you cherish true Victorian literature, avoid Affinity like the plague.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This was a riveting book. It kept you very involved in all the different lives. Very worth the time involved in reading it.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This is a movie that everyone should see!!!!<br />The acting is wonderful!!!!You will not regret<br />buying this movie!!!! A++++++++ !!!!!
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I didn,t really like to have to play in a tournament  I really like the other  bird games much better.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This movie is in one word AWESOME!!!!!<br />I would recommend this to anyone!!<br />You will enjoy this from start to finish!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|hard to get bonuses<br />good effects fun and easy to play.  you want to save on to your diamonds so you have more options later
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very well written. If you've only seen the movie and liked it, you'll love the book. Have the second one ready to go.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|This game was awesome and a friend of mine says he is so awesome I don't think so for sonic fans out there I recommend getting this
B002ZG9774|5.0|thank you the movie is awesome Love Cher and Christina both actress were awesome saw it at the movie and rented and now bought it
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Very interesting read.  I like it almost as much as the Hunger Games.  I am a fan of Lauren Oliver's work.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The help representative that I dealt with was SO friendly, informative, thorough and patient!<br />I means a lot to me that Amazon was willing to send me a replacement cable and PowerFast for my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I have been debating on saving up for an I-Pad or the newer HD Kindle Fires. This experience has convinced me that the company I want to stay with is Amazon.<br /><br />Thank you for being so GREAT to your customers!<br />That is so rare these days!<br />I'm extremely impressed!
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I have been reading alot of book of this style lately starting with the Hunger Games.  While I wasn't as captivated with this nearly as much it was still a very good read.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I am so happy I read this. One of the best I've read in a while. I really loved it.
B009LRE040|5.0|Wish this wasn't the end of the series.  Though maybe with the ending the way it was it won't be you never know.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I think that this book can sail to many kids<br />I gives you many lessons some people can read this book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game! wish the coins regenerated faster!<br /><br />very addictive and fun to play any time I want to take my mind off the every day stress.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like the way you can do the same puzzle, but with different number of pieces. Makes it good for different age levels. I would like to see an option to turn off the game sound. Also I would to be able to change the background color to make the pieces easier to see when they are too close to the color of the default background.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|The only problem I have with this app is the ugly-ass notification icon, but since Android Jelly Bean has the option to block notifications from individual apps, I decided to reinstall it. It seems to still work this way.<br /><br />Addendum (10-29-2014): The app used more than 1 gig of data in a three hour period. The FAQ and the dev say the perceived data usage is because all internet traffic is piped through AdBlock, which is fine, except that the \\"streaming\\" stopped immediately after uninstalling AdBlock. There's no way, under even heavy usage, that anybody can use 1+ gig of data in three hours unless they're streaming 10 movies simultaneously or running a torrent server - neither of which I was doing.
B00865P3AS|3.0|I just received my copy of this CD and VERY disappointed - too much \\"hard\\" rock, not enough mellow cello!!  They blew it on this one!!  Not what I expected - David Garrett did the similar thing with his violin CD - went from a blend of beautiful classical music with a comptemporary theme to hard rock and it just ruins the instrument and the beauty of the music!!<br /><br />Skip this one!!
B0061S073A|5.0|I like to get games for my grandchildren to play.  After<br />trying a few, I found that the children can spend real<br />money in the game.  This parental control file, allows<br />me to put games into this file and it protects me by not<br />allowing any purchases without my code (which they don't have)<br />great idea. I can relax and let them enjoy their games<br />without any surprises later on my account.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly delivers once again with Harry Bosch. An exciting thriller with an unpredictable outcome, as always. Bosch is the kind of man we hope to find in our own police departments - passionate about his work without losing his compassion towards victims & their families.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|My 2 year old granddaughter and I love the Dr. Panda apps.  They are interactive,but also educational.  With the garden app we can learn about planting and growing, and she is learning new vocabulary also.  I recommend this program to anyone with young children.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This is a cautionary tale about people who make rash decisions and then suffer the consequences and inflict others with the effects.
B00280LYIM|5.0|It was a really good book and I can't wait to read the next one<br />If there is going to be a next one
B000F2C87Q|5.0|I have been listening to and collecting blues for about 20 years (my most favorite bluesmen include Lightnin' Hopkins and John Lee Hooker).  While expanding my blues collection to the Hill Country Blues of Mississippi, I have been digging into RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, and some lesser-known artists recorded on the Fat Possum label.  The label (plus a recent interest in the White Stripes) is what led me to the Black Keys.  This long EP/short LP is the perfect meeting of drone-oriented Hill Country blues and slacker-esque Black Keys grunge/blues/rock.  I hope it motivates listeners to delve into lesser-known blues artists like Robert Belfour and Charles Caldwell ([[ASIN:B00004T4AH What's Wrong With You]];[[ASIN:B00008O31O Pushin My Luck]];[[ASIN:B0001ENXYU Remember Me]]; all on Fat Possum) and/or explore more Black Keys music.  Thank you, Fat Possum!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Fired right up on my XP powered laptop. I had previously installed a driver for another SERIAL-&#62;USB adapter. Apparently it works for this one as well.<br /><br />This unit is much better quality that the cheaper ones on the market. Most of those are junk. You get what you pay for. No complaints here.
B000002GXJ|5.0|This is one of those albums I had earlier, but somehow let get away from me.  In my opinion, it's perhaps the best of all the group's albums.  As the title implies, it captures a live performance.  It's tempting to believe that a live performance of all the &#34;greatest hits&#34; can't possibly be as good as the same songs rendered in the controlled conditions of a studio.  Not the case with this album.  It's technically rich, and it seems that at this point in the Eagles' career, they've honed each of their hits to perfection.  The nuances and flourishes seem to be just what the original studio performances were grasping for, but slightly missed.  Often when artists give a live performance, they want to halfheartedly zip through their golden oldies so they can get on to whatever is newest.  Again, not the case with this album.  Fans came to hear their old favorites, and the E's respect that.  All the energy and emotion is there -- fresh and evocative.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A very moving book.  The main male character had a past that almost ruined his chance for a happy life.  Although the book ended with a twist, I was happy with the way the 2 main characters eventually came together.  I recommend it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it here is a great seed you might want walk around though the seed is herobrine just don't build seven house or herobrine will destroy one!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought subway surfers was legendary it was epic and strange when i first went on it though when it changed to Sydney i couldn't get that i was stuck on Rome but i was ok with it but everyone had it but me could you make sure i get one next time please
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game lags slightly but other than that it is a fun game.  sometimes it puts two jump obsticles in a row and it becomes impossible to countinue without saving yourself
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I have found already that this case along with the Kindle Fire HD is almost like being able to have a portable office.  I enjoy the flexibility of having the tablet in landscape or portrait to accommodate various applications.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|My tablet crashed after loading it and even after uninstalling it I contined to have issues with other applications. Had to reset to factory defaults. It did not work as well as just using a browser on my Android tablet. This app is a piece of crap! and I DO NOT recommend installing it.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Good film one of the best dark knight series. Would recommend to anyone liking surprises and action films for enjoyment.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|my six year old loves this game.  wish there were more ways to earn big bucks but otherwise it is fun!
B00873GRU4|5.0|I haven't read sci-fi since school (reformed nerd I guess) and forgot how gripping it could be. Wool gets you quickly by hinting at a backstory you'll spend the next 3 books chipping away at. The novella structure guides you into the story without introducing the protagonist too early and gives you a great feel for the life of the silo without giving away the secrets behind its existence or social structure. The mystery will stick with you and drive you crazy, even as it remains a well paced adventure. I've been promoting this book to anyone who'll listen.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really like the colors and it reminds me of a game that you connect the dots.  I rated it a 4 because I really like it but I do not like having to pay for hints when you are stumpted.  I do feel a since of accomplishment when I finish each game.  I initially thought oh, this is child's play but it does get a bit challenging.  I would recommend it to others.
B0097JYVAU|4.0|Nate Silver's description of Bayesian analysis in action is way less nerdy than that sounded. Prediction is so important to modern life and has become part of the background noise of our lives, yet most of us don't understand the processes by which predictions are made or how best to interpret them. This book succeeds in general by providing interesting examples.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I rated this alarm clock with a 5 because I really like this app.  I like the display and the setting easy to follow.  I like that it gives  options for the alarm sounds.  Yes, I would recommend this app to others.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book by Nicholas Sparks.  If you like his previous books you will like this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it is so so so fun and I just can't get enough of it. I would have to say that subway surfers is the best game EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007CI81IQ|3.0|I found flicking back and forth to see the diagrams/graphs etc was too difficult. The Kindle edition needs work. Rather buy this in hard copy.
B00942G4UA|4.0|If you want to know how food makes it to your table this is a must watch. I didn't realize how inhumane animals are slaughtered. a real eye opener
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The latest Bond movie is like a lawnmower that is running out of gas and you are tying to finish that last patch while knowing you wont make it.<br />You keep watching this movie hoping that it will be great and it isnt.<br /><br />The first couple of hours:) of the movie have some interesting and riveting special effects moments.....There is also a nice vintage feel to the movie that harkens back to the best of the Connery \\"Bond\\", and the choice for the evil foe was inspired.. The other nice touches would be the time spent creating genuine heat and chemistry between Bond and his pretty \\"ladies\\"....Much attention was given to this, and it worked, and also adding Ben Whisaw as \\"Q\\" is a spectacular choice.<br />Ben Whisaw is one of the best actors around and he elevates any role he is given, including \\"Q\\".<br />If you've not seen him in \\"Bright Star\\" then you are missing something wonderful.<br />It was also nice to see Albert Finney once again all dressed up and grinning like some Charles Dicken's character.<br />The biggest downside of the movie was the fire-worked and cliched ending, which included finding myself yawning during the last 20 mins.<br />Im not big on huge and endless fires in movies as a way to burn up 25 mins of nothing in the script.,and a whole lot of burning up goes on in this Bond the last 30 mins.<br />The continual Achilles heel regarding this movie was a bit of focus lack in the script and the fact that the ending was extremely anti-climatic.<br />The ending is frankly not well written.<br />Yes, overall its slightly better then the last Bond movie, but as compared to Casino Royale, it just does not have any big money to place on the table.<br />The Daniel Craig \\"Bond\\" series made a huge mistake when they killed Eva Green in Casino Royale as she really made that movie click.....They should have let her live and brought her back at some point, and now that they have also killed off the superb Judi Dench \\"M\\" character, the last of the special magic that was left of Daniel Craig Bond series has forever vanished.gic that was left of Daniel Craig Bond series has forever vanished.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The Martian is a diamond in the rough. I did not expect to find such a readable peice of fiction in this book but was pleasantly surprised. The tension is palpable at times and the science is well thought out. Overall, you will enjoy the creativity of Andy Weir and his strong adherence to fact based fiction. You might, however, be put off by his less than formal tone, some pacing issues here and there, and a very linear plot.<br /><br />I wasn't all too torn up by the downfalls as Andy doesn't give you much time to dwell on them, there is always something exciting happening (exempting the few times he loses himself in his own writing and rambles about things that don't necessarily matter). If I were to give this book my toughest criticism, I would say that he author is a theoretical space-flight enthusiast first and a writer second. His plot is very simple, his characters motivations are basic, and his dialogue (though very sparse) is contrived. For instance, Matt's crew-mates seem very flat and their dialogue is forced. All this included, he did, however, still manage to make a fantastic book. I can only imagine how great he would be if he had the ability to craft complex plots, and perhaps he does- he just wasn't able to show it in this book as it is very &#34;Castaway-esque.&#34; Either way, I will keep my eye on Mr. Weir, I look forward to reading his novels in the future.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|The app functions exactly as I expected it to. The app is useful and easy to use with very few bugs.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I admittedly watched Star Trek: The Next Generation growing up, off and on but would never have called myself a \\"Trekker\\" until fairly recently. I got Netflix a few years back and went through all of the TNG episodes and movies. After finishing those, I felt compelled to see where it all started. Still, I wasn't interested enough to sit down and watch TOS. I instead rediscovered a love for older Sci-Fi, revisiting classic B movies and shows like The Twilight Zone and Night Gallery. After a few months of really appreciating the creativity and HUGE ideas conquered by this genre, I felt well prepared to dip my toe in the Trek origins, I was not dissapointed.<br /><br />First, let me say this: TOS is not about action, it has some pretty dated effects and costumes, the acting styles are very much influenced by classical training, and the suspension of disbelief is required frequently. If any of those things are \\"deal-breakers\\" for you, just skip this all-together; you will not enjoy the series and your negative opinion of it may dissuade others from checking it out.<br /><br />TOS IS about philosophy, science, discovery, human emotion, love, camaraderie, loyalty, duty, and self sacrifice. TOS tackles very big ideas, concepts, and philosophies and often times leaves the conclusion to the viewer. The biggest draw to the show is probably the themes and issues that they tackle but a close runner-up is the on-screen chemistry of the cast. Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty are an incredible team and they play off one another perfectly.<br /><br />That is really all you need to know in order to determine if you want to watch this show but I will go ahead and make a recommendation if you are completely new to Trek and want to know where to start. If you are younger, &lt;35, I say start this way:<br /><br />1. Watch the new Star Trek Movie (2009) first to introduce you to the characters in a way that is action packed and fun<br />2. From here you can go back and Start TOS<br />3. Don't watch the Star Trek Movies until you have finished TOS, but once you have, watch them in order up THROUGH Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country and stop.<br />4. Now watch Star Trek TNG all the way to the end before watching any of the other movies<br />5. Watch the remaining 4 films after seeing all of TNG.<br />6. At this point you are caught up and can watch DS9, Voyager, or Enterprise in any order, if you wish but I highly recommend re-watching the new Star Trek Movie after having seen TOS and all the movies, it will give you a different perspective on it. Oh and then you can watch Star Trek: Into the Darkness, assuming you do all this after May 17, 2013.<br /><br />A HEADS UP ON TOS:<br />The series starts off with a pilot episode and you will be confused if you aren't forewarned; The episode has Chris Pike as captain and the entire command crew is different. This pilot was rejected by the network and another one was commissioned. The second episode is actually the real \\"first\\" episode. Don't skip the pilot though, as it is a great episode and Captain Christopher Pike is mentioned later in the series.watch the Star Trek Movies until you have finished TOS, but once you have, watch them in order up THROUGH Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country and stop.<br />4.

B009VL28W2|2.0|This Blu has excellent picture and audio quality. Something you would expect from a blu. The performance and the editing, however, are no good. Metallica's low effort sped up performance was most annoying and influenced my rating greatly. All the songs are sped up, chopped up and performed without emotion; like they were just performing the song to rush them out of queue for the next. I get the up-tempo approach and some songs condensing because Metallica has such a large library and their fans want all their favorite songs but still make it worth listening to right? I prefer fewer songs with higher quality. Less is more. Also, Hetfield's vocals sounded lazy. He was almost talking through most the lyrics and often he dropped his octaves with (spoken) clean vocals. Metal attitude was non-existent, he was happy, cocky and casual. Unfortunately his performance matched. That is not the Metallica I remember, however, because they were about attitude. They were not your friends. So much for performance.<br /><br />Not quite as influential to my negative rating, but still important, was the video edits. What's up with all the super extreme close-ups and the millisecond cuts? I guess they were trying to make up for the uninspired performances with visual faced paced edits. When I see concerts I want to see performances. Focus on the dominant musician and show me their skills. I want to see Kirk's solos, I want to see James shred, and show me Lars's drum-kit! Does Danny have chops? Video or it didn't happen. I don't know if it happened because I only saw their faces.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|I love this app, the colors, and the flexability.<br /><br />I wish the developer add the option to add multiple timers, like you can with the alarm...
B00005JKNF|2.0|We had had very high expectations for this murder mystery ,&#34;Gosford Park&#34; .After all it was an Academy Award Winner and had two &#34;Thumbs UP &#34;what a disappointment and let down.as it was not up to the usually very high direction and production standards to which we have become accustomed.The most annoying thing was most of the group scenes had way too many characters in them and all talking at the same time,we had difficulty following who was saying what..On a positive note the cast was terrific.
0811879542|5.0|I bought this for a very happy 3 year old. She LOVES to act out each page of the book with so much enthusiasm that we usually end up reading it twice. One of the best gifts I have purchased for her. She asks to read it almost every day. Very interactive!
193700788X|1.0|I feel that I have wasted 10 years and hundreds of dollars. I think the other reviewers have accurately expressed the problems with this book so I will keep it short.  I just want to say that this is by far the worst ending that could have possibly been created.  Boo, Ms. Harris, Boo!  I really wish I could have given it a NEGATIVE 5....

B005FFW46S|5.0|As usual, Terry Pratchett delivers a hilarious and entertaining book entailing the further adventures of Commander Vimes. Between the murders and the vacation Sam Vimes is about to go crazy with the lack of law on his much too pompous family estate which comes courtesy of his wife's family. But with the help of his trusty aid who's just a tad too handy with weapons for Vimes' peace of mind he manages to bring law to a world where money buys everything including the law.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game. and once I started playing I couldn't put it down. well only to wait on another life.
B00CC1JXYE|4.0|When I first purchased my Galaxy S4, I decided to purchase the flip cover produced by Samsung. I wasn't very happy with that product for various reasons (you can go to my profile and read my review on that cover) so I decided to look on Amazon for an another flip cover. After browsing for about 30 minutes, I landed on this product. Once going over the details and comparing it to the smart cover by Samsung, I decided to purchase this product for two main reasons. One reason is that this cover covers the entire phone, front and back which the Samsung smart cover fails to do. Second reason was that this cover enables you to have standing view, which again the Samsung flip cover fails to do. On paper comparison this was the clear winner, so I placed my order and waited anxiously. This morning I received the cover and I opened up the package right away. Once I took out the cover out of the package, I was pretty disappointed. I will now explain my overall judgement of the cover in three separate categories so you can get a clear idea on what to expect.<br /><br />Cover - The cover isn't the best. From the pictures and description, I had high expectations. When I first retrieved the cover after opening the package, I was very disappointed. The flip cover is very slim and light, if someone were to bend it by mistake it would be completely ruined. Due to the slimness of the flip cover I cannot comprehend it to be of any protection for the screen. If someone were to drop their phone accidentally, there is a very good chance the screen might be damaged. The back of the cover is also very slim and it is glued to a plastic holder which holds the Galaxy S4 in place. I do love the idea of the plastic holder because the design enables the cover to protect the entire phone from being scratched, which is great for preserving the Galaxy S4's beautiful appearance. Another negative aspect of this cover is that the cover is actually bigger than the S4, which causes the flip cover to move around and that can cause the smart cover to actually turn on your phone while in your pocket. However, I did realize that after installing the HD Screen protector that I purchased from Rearth, the cover stayed on the screen much more and moved around a lot less. (If you decide to purchase this product, make sure your purchase using the deal being offered by Rearth. You receive 3 HD Screen Protectors and this screen for $35, basically you save 5 dollars on this cover and get 3 high quality screen protectors for free, can't beat that!)<br /><br />Smart Cover - The Smart cover or the S View Folio does work wonderfully. Even though the flip cover can move and flap around, it doesn't turn on your phone that easily. After you flip the cover open, it takes about 1 second for the phone to turn on, which gives you just enough time to shut it back up if you opened the case up by mistake or if you have the phone in your pocket and the flip cover moves around, it won't turn your phone on right away. The Window on the flip cover is very responsive and registers without any errors. When you close the case, the time and notifications are shown instantly in the small window letting you know it is in S View. Overall it is very good and by far the best aspect of the case.<br /><br />Standing View - The standing view of this case is very poor. The back of the case is designed so that the cover splits perfectly to go in standing view however the case does not have any support to hold the phone in place. For example, if you put the phone in standing view and angle it a little bit low, the weight of the phone will make the case drop. Due to the lack of support, if you were to put the phone in standing view on a soft surface such as a bed, there is a high chance that the phone once again will drop. Overall it is a good concept that the original S View case by Samsung does not have, however an idea is only as good as it is executed.<br /><br />Overall it is a decent case that I am goingto end up using due to the protection my phone receives from scratches, however if you are looking for a much more sleek design and a better fit/finish S View case and not care about protection that much, then my recommendation is that you purchase the one made by Samsung.to end up using due to the protection my phone receives from scratches, however if you are looking for a much more sleek design and a better fit/finish S View case and not care about protection that much, then my recommendation is that you purchase the one made by Samsung.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I just got this app and I already love it. I have been in it 10 minutes strait. it is very addicting and fun
B0086700CM|3.0|I'll keep this simple.  This is a fun game, fast paced, easy to do the basic goals, very hard to do the advanced goals.<br /><br />The draw back to it is it the same game over and over.  Very repetitive.  The longer you run, the faster you go, and the harder it is to keep up.  It would be cool if there were different levels where the run actually ended.  And then you would start a different type of run with different obstacles/goals, etc.<br /><br />But Hey - it's free.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I like this case because it isn't too big or too fantsy.  It is just simple and does it's job which is to protect the kindle so it works very well for me.
0060012358|5.0|This ... this is a bit of a go at the Pied Piper story. With a touch of Puss in Boots. And practically every fluffy bunny story every written. Mostly told by Maurice and an assemblage of Changed, and quite educated, rats.<br />The story is starts off simple. Talking cat, smart rats, stupid-looking kid with whistle. Go into town, plague of rats, pay stupid-looking kid money to drive rats out. Move on to next town. Easy money. That is, until they get to Bad Blintz, an apparently ratless town that doesn't seem to know they're ratless. Then things get a little ... interesting.<br />There's a definite vein of silliness lurking in the background, even with all the seriousness of killing and talks of death going on. I do love the rat names: Dangerous Beans, Nourishing, Hamnpork, Peaches, Sardines (in fact, I love everything about Sardines) and Darktan. I love how the rats are still rats and not all 'Mr. Bunnsy'. A little reminiscent of the Mrs Frisby and the Rats of N.I.M.H. or Watership Down there (and, the occasional time, The Tale of Desperaux). Only with a nicer ending.<br />And the ending ... classic Pratchett twist there.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I am a the first fan of my little pony friendship is magic.<br />Tears the MY little pony caterlot  writing.<br />More pony in the game like twilight's DAD.<br />If you get it you will have a blast.
0060507772|5.0|Simple plot to this one. The last hero wants to return to the gods what the first hero stole. In Discworld, that means fire, which would mean the end of the world. So naturally, someone's got to stop them. Of course, it's not that simple (whenever is it?).<br />But this story incorporates a number of my favourite characters - Cohen the Barbarian, Rincewind, Carrot Ironsfounderson & Leonard da Quirm to name a few - with the last three ending up on the moon.<br /><br />I think I probably spent an equal amount of time staring at the pictures as I did reading. They are exquisite. If you have not seen a copy of this, you simply must. My only lament is that the story was too short and I'd have liked a few more of the details at the end filled out.

0142424277|5.0|I've only ever seen the movie before now, so when I found this in the secondhand shop I simply had to grab it. The movie really didn't do it justice.<br />Dahl's descriptions are wonderful, especially when it gets to point where Matilda uses her 'strong eyes' to push over the newt-filled glass.<br /><br />I think I'll keep this one on my shelf for when my daughter's old enough to read it. Then we can love it together.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|There was something about it that I felt compelled to come back to. I have now seen it four times. The more I see it, the more I see into it.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book is excelent to help you identify your habits and change them if you so wish. Many of the ideas can be applied for business purposes too. I found it very useful.
B002ECQQZ0|5.0|This is a greatly modernized version of the original, some will like it, others maybe offended, but either way, this re-make is definitely not for the weak-hearted.
0486295559|5.0|I received \\"Persuasion\\"(Dover Thrift Editions) two days early. I was thrilled that it was the very cover design, an old fashioned flower print, that I wanted. I hope to build up a set of these Austen titles. There is no introduction or helps at the back, but the book is the larger paperback (6\\"x 8\\" and a half an inch thick). The print, although not large, is comfortable to read on off white paper similar to newsprint. It is made in the USA and is printed and covered with 10% recycled paper. Sometimes products that are green are more expensive but not that is not the case with these editions.
B009NY43NY|3.0|the book was good.  But I was hoping that Sookie would end up with someone else. At the end of the last book I kind of thought I knew who she w a s going to end up with and she did .  So I am disappointed.  I almost did not buy this book because I knew I was going to be disappointed.  Ever since the first book I wanted sookie and Eric to be together even when she was with Bill.  I like Sam but hoped that they w would just remain friends.  Part of me wishes now that I had not read this book so I could keep on hoping.

The movie is a girl's dream...fall in love while in Europe...<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone reading this but if you love sappy chick flicks, you will love this...and make sure to have tissues handy ;)
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|This review is after my first time watching this film.  I was a little worried by the lower rated posts on this film, but decided to give it a chance.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I found the story easy to follow, and quite sweet.  I didn't even realize the time had gone by as it had.  Unfortunately, the pasta I was making during the film didn't make it.  It was worth the sacrifice.  I can understand that people that have gotten used to the new style Hollywood movies that couldn't care less if it had a plot or theme, might have a hard time of following along. I wouldn't say this is award material, but definitely one that I'm glad I watched and I would probably watch again, though not too far in the near future.  Tom Hanks did an admirably good job.  I thought the beginning where he had his monologue did not bode well for the movie, but he progressed so well I forgot about it until writing the review.  Holly Barry also did a smart job.  Not as good as Hanks, but worthy.  I feel she represented herself quite well, and I must say she's done better than expected.  I'm looking forward to her next character. Jim Broadbent was of course amazing.  He's always been able to harness a character to the fullest.  Hugo Weaving was surprising in this one.  He also is a maverick when it comes to different characters.  I especially loved when he was suddenly Nurse Noakes!  OMG!  Loved it!!
B001IF252C|5.0|I purchased a different brand years ago because earlier versions of this product only worked with the Apple cinema 30\\" display.  That died.  I have this now, and now this product (thanks to firmware 1.3) works with non-Apple brand monitors.  I have no disconnection and no flicker with my Dell 30\\" 3007WFP monitor.  It's fantastic, I highly recommend this product.

B0061PEAUY|1.0|Very disappointed!this was my first Kathy Reich's book. The script for the tv show is much better. Will not read any more Reich's books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app runs well on my kindle fire, and it is a great way to kill time when stuck waiting. While gameplay is easy and intuitive, advancing is difficult. This is a highly addictive combination that makes you keep wanting to try &quot;just one more time&quot;. One of my favorite apps even though I usually prefer puzzles like suduko or crosswords.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|So this being a movie after a book, and me being one of those people who like to read the book first, I read the book right before I watched this.<br /><br />This is very different than the book.<br /><br />I loved the book. Funny, raw, confusing, quirky, real. A good insight into mental illness and an interesting viewpoint. The book keeps you guessing. You don't know Pat's story right away, it unfolds for you, and when you think you know it, you find out that you didn't know anything about it. You root for Pat, and you feel for him and you laugh at his quirks. And you'll never see Kenny G the same way again.<br /><br />The movie, tells you the beginning of Pat's story, and then you follow along. You know why Pat is where he is. The relationships he has with his family is almost opposite than the book. And he's less unstable than in the book. Everything is toned down. From his mental capacity, to Tiffany's scheming, to his therapist's involvement, to his father's obsession with football.<br />The movie takes Quick's story and makes it fit better in Hollywood.<br />And I loved the movie.<br /><br />It's good. It's real and awkward and beautiful. But if you're expecting a light-hearted Rom-Com, you won't find it. If you're expecting a scene-by-scene, word-for-word adaptation of the book, you won't find it.<br />But if you want a good story that makes you smile and cringe and feel like every cloud actually does have a silver lining, than you will be satisfied.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought this book was a little better than the first. I liked the growing love story and the transformation of Christian yet it still had a fun sultry and sexy twist
193700788X|1.0|I didn't want to believe it, but all the spoilers were true, yet they entertained me more than this book which was utterly boring. What a horrible way to end this series. I'm so disappointed I don't know what to say.<br /><br />*sad julie*

1416909532|5.0|It seems like everywhere you turn the phrase \\"He's just not that into you\\" is being thrown around. And for good reason! The ladies are finally done waiting by the phone - hey, why sit at home for the phone to ring when it's so obvious that he's just not into you enough to be calling?<br /><br />Seriously though, \\"He's Just Not That Into You: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys\\" really helped me see the light at the end of the tunnel in a recent break up. Reading through this book made some things really clear in my mind and somehow made things seem not so bad.<br /><br />Since then, I've given this book to a friend who was going through the break up stage. She was, you know, sitting around waiting for the phone to ring (it was never going to). I'm not saying she was thrilled to get the book (who wants to admit he's just not into them?), but when she actually sat down to read it, she was glad I gave it to her.<br /><br />There's a lot of comfort knowing when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em.
0307474259|5.0|I've been hearing about Gary Taubes on Instapundit for a long time, and even ordered this book last summer.  It lay unopened on my shelf for several months.  Then, when Charlie Martin began his 13-week trial of the diet in November 2012, I decided to read the book.  I was amazed by what I found in the opening chapters, and began the diet the following day.  I've lost 25 pounds without feeling hungry, and since I love to cook, found it easy to prepare delicious meals within the confines of this new lifestyle.<br /><br />Not all people have developed insulin resistance, but those of us who have had a lot of extra weight clinging to us for decades now have a new opportunity to lose weight and keep it off.  I always knew carbs were at the root of my problem, but never understood why.  This book explains it.  It also explains why current US dietary guidelines are actually the REASON why there is an obesity epidemic today.  Imagine that - if we follow Michelle Obama's advice, we'll actually get fatter.  You really need to read this book!<br /><br />I've already purchased 4 copies to loan out to friends and family, and will order a fifth to give to my cardiologist when I see him in a few weeks.  He should know why my triglycerides were cut in half after only 2 months on the diet, and I'm hoping this book may help him to treat others.

B009NY43NY|1.0|*********************SPOILER ALERT**********************SPOILER ALERT*******************<br /><br />Let me first start by saying that this is my first ever Negative feedback that I have given, that is tells you how completely disgusted I am with the final book for poor Sookie!  have been following this series since the very beginning and have always been very impressed the the development and depth of each character CH was able to create.  We grew to love and understand each of the friends and lovers of Sookie's life and felt we were actually there during each event in Sookie's life.<br /><br />I am completely disappointed in the way CH seemed to have felt it necessary to forgot and contradict many things of the past books.  The friends that came to support Sookie were flat and uninteresting.  I felt she was in such a hurry to give Sookie an ending that she lost her fire for who and what we grew to love.  I was completely disappointed in the way she handled Eric's character.  He has always been large than life, strong, INDEPENDENT and no caring a damn what anyone else thought.  He was there through and thin for Sookie and then in this book, he barely even exists.  He ignores Sookie, treats her poorly, and dumps on her without even seeming to care at all.  CH destroyed a vampire we had grown to love.<br /><br />Not only Eric was a disppointment in this final book.  It seems CH felt some need to bring everyone of Sookie's past, but they truly had not continued with the depth of each one of them.  It seemed they were simply a ship passing through, dropping in to tell Sookie they are there for her (but not really as everyone left her in the end) and left her completely alone. Tara - Dull, Quinn - Dull, Alcide - Dull.  Amelia's reaction to her father's involvement completely unbelieveable!  I felt she dropped Sam into her lap only to find someway for Sookie not to be alone in the end.  There was absolutely no fireworks or explosion of chemistry between Sookie and Sam whohad such a deep and strong friendship, and to feel the need to take that away and make in something it was not with an unbelieveable and sloppy love scene, that I was absolutely disgusted!<br /><br />And can I ask?  Why bring in a totally new vampire child of Eric's in the very end when there had never been any mention of another child through the entire previous 12 books?  Inconsistencies, in congruities, and devastation and everyone we had grown and fell in love with.  An complete waste of time to read this story.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I have played this game the iPhone, very fun. I have this game on my kindle fire, frustrating.  The view is far too close, it has many fun aspects and goals cut from the iPhone version- spell book, trading gem post, collecting dragons for incentives, wheel of fortune, many dragons you can simply not breed or buy, and for coins you can not speed up breeding. The game creators are apparently tech racist. Apple version is great- kindle get the wimpy frustrating version.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|This seems like a great game but I have gotten stuck in chapter two, three times now.  The game is not producing the desired results when an action is completed.  First time when I rotated the Kindle so the marbles lit up the place for the large key did not appear. I put on the eyepiece and could see the different colored pieces but the place for the key did not appear.  I started that chapter over and it worked the second time.  Once I got past that, I only got two of the three cogs that I need for the third plunger that rises on the side of the box.  Found cogs in two different places but the drawer that is supposed to contain two only has one in it.  Not sure if this is making sense but if you have played it you should know what I am talking about.  Have started a third time and the place for the big key has not appeared again.  Going to do it one more time from the beginning of this chapter step by step from a walkthrough on youtube to see if it will work this time.  Frustrating to say the least.<br />I am running it on a Kindle Fire HD.  Other than these problems the game looks great and is a challenge but not unfinishable.<br />Still gave it four stars since that is what it deserves if I can get it finished.<br />Anyone else have problems like this?<br /><br />Later:  OK, I started the chapter over and the only difference that I could see between the way I did it and the walkthrough was that the marbles that have to light up did light up but in a different order just due to the way that my Kindle was laying.  The part for the big key did not open again so I am done now....won't try it again unless someone comes on here and can tell me what I am doing wrong.<br /><br />Changing my star rating to two stars.

031620157X|5.0|This is such a good book.  Yes, there is some redundancy in wording but don't forget this is written for a younger audience though I believe it appeals to a much older one as well.  The book is fast paced and entertaining.  Alex's brains combined with Conner's clever, sharp wit are fun to read.  The real bonus comes in getting the audio and listening to the author, Chris Colfer, read his book to you.  The voice and tone he gives to each character brings the book alive.  I laughed so hard at some points that I cried.  This is a very entertaining book and I can't wait for it's sequel.  I fell in love with Chris as Kurt in Glee and find he is a very intelligent, passionate young man.  His movie Struck by Lightning really moved me, again I cried but this time for complete sadness.  I read the book and then saw the movie.  I can't wait to see what else this young actor/author/screen writer is going to do, but I know that I'll be there to see it and cheer him on.  I pray that he stays on the screen, TV/movies so that we can continue watching him perform.  He really is an amazing talent.

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This game is pretty fun to play, graphics and battle scenes are awesome. Just  one problem, when you get allies many  of them you won't load
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I have loved the music of the Piano Guys for years now, and this has some of their greatest songs.  The DVD allows you to not only listen, but see the fun, the passion, the drive they put into their music.  I put the DVD in for me to watch, and the rest of the family gathered to enjoy as well.  If you are debating on getting this... buy it!  It's great!
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Quite possibly the best movie ever made. If you haven't seen it hold your hand out and slap it...then go see it...NOW!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use app to check my work when I'm unsure about my answer, and like I said, #nerd. LOL ROFL LMAO
B004USLWVE|4.0|I have a Rebel T3i and I ended up returning this because it was WAY too big. My camera was swimming in it. (which means it wasn't snugly protected and would have been knocking around) It's a great bag and seems like it would work well with a full-frame—maybe even with a battery grip and large lens. I'd recommend the bag to someone with camerazilla, but anything smaller than that go for something else.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am very addicted to this new way to play a game I have been playing since I was a little kid back in the day.
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|I had seen the original, X rated version I presume, while in college.  The only redeeming value the movie had was graphic sex and violence.  All of that has been cut from the R rated version available on Amazon On Demand.  All you get is a bunch of talk and people running around naked.  But nothing like the real Caligula.  Don't bother renting this unless they have the actual version available.  And FYI, when searching for the movie, Amazon purports that this is the X rated version, but when you go to download it they actually give you the worthless R rated version.  I took a chance on it hoping that was a typo, but no.  Thanks for the bait and switch Amazon...super disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great great great can't wait till part 4<br />Waiting to see what else Christian and Ana will explore and get through
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|GREAT  BOOK AND STORY  It just shows what the greatest generation is all about and how we all should step back and review our lives.
6305428042|5.0|My kids loved to watch this movie all year but definitely at Halloween. Just brings back fond memories now that the kids are all grown up...
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Another great action film in the Underworld series and the ending leaves you with no doubt that there will be another one in the near future.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The quests are getting a little more challenging. So far the game has been exciting. It is a little slow to recharge.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Don't make the same mistake I did.  We bought this movie, but didn't watch it right away, because we had gone to the movies to see it.  By the time we did, it didn't work right.  Half way through the movie it just stopped.  I'm not saying it was Amazon's fault.  Just a bad DVD.  Next time I will make sure we watch an ordered movie before the return date expires.  Very disappointed though.
1401216676|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this comic. I think that the idea of the whole thing is just so cool and that the artwork is fabulous. the only problem that I had with this comic is that it's really short, I wished it was longer, but other then that it was a great read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Bought this &#34;trend&#34; of all the trends book. The book was ok for what it's worth, but i did find spelling errors and repeated paragraphs throughout the book. I haven't bought a Kindle book since.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is a great game. Great graphics and action, also like this missions. How could you possibly go wrong it is free
193700788X|1.0|13 years ago I started reading these books. Every may I would run to the bookstore and rush home to read in one sitting. The last  three books Were pretty bad, but seeing how much I loved some of these characters, I still somehow had hopes that it would all get better. It didn't. The writing is terrible, there's continuity errors and the main characters have become unrecognizable. I can't go into details without spoiling it for someone but do yourself a favor and read something else.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game, seems like it could be addicting... so far so good, I enjoy it. Have not played enough for a real review, but the game asked me to rate for diamonds. Sooooo yep.
193700788X|1.0|I was given a copy of this book to read and I am so glad.... glad that I did not have to waste my hard earned money on something that in all honesty fails to live up to expectations.<br /><br />Ms Harris herself has stated in interviews that this would be an unpopular ending and that she would have to go in hiding once it was released and she wasn't kidding.<br /><br />If it is true that she came up with this ending after book 2 or 3 then this would have indeed made logical sense as a final book if 4 were all that was planned.  Instead, we were given 13 books, 5 of which CH also admits she was coerced into writing, that took the readers in a particular direction.  One can only assume that the focus on Eric was quite simply a grab for money as no-one is interested in same and this became even more apparent after True Blood came to air and Alexander Skarsgard brought the beloved Viking to life.<br /><br />CH has claimed that she writes for herself and yet if this were true she would have ceased her books at book 8 as she originally intended and also gone through with her plan to kill Bill: both of which she was encouraged away from.  I cannot even begin to presume as to why she was so intent on ending her series this way, particularly knowing how the majority of her fan base feels.<br /><br />Too many questions were left open in my opinion.  The end is truly blah and does not at all leave the reader with a sense of closure, finality, or completion of the heroines journey; perhaps a blatant attempt to get people to purchase the Coda due out later this year?<br /><br />Eric, truly the most beloved of all characters in this series, and was written as essentially a bad-a** as he is a 1000 year old Viking, was essentially sold into slavery and considering how his early years as vampire began thanks to his maker Appius, this is truly the most cruel of endings.  He is forced to give up his businesses, his children, his love, his marriage and his home and becomes what is essentially arm-candy, all for the bargain price of 200 years.<br /><br />The 'chemistry' between Sookie and her chosen 'love' is bland at best, showing less chemistry than an 8th grader in science class.  It's stilted, confusing, and flies in the face of what CH herself established through her series.  To suddenly go from being unable to be with 'normal men' and not wanting children, to riding off into the sunset with a non-vampire with plans to add to the population of Bon Temps without any prior for-shadowing is sloppy at best.<br /><br />What of the Vampires?  Long claimed as being CH's equivalent of minority groups such as race or homosexuals, we are essentially left with the message that there can be no happily ever after for them; particularly upsetting given CH's own family.<br /><br />And what of the subject of rape?  Our heroine was violated several books ago and yet has seemingly gotten over it to the point that she speaks to her attacker regularly, considers him a friend and asks for relationship advice!  All while treating her husband with suspicion, anger and distrust.  As someone who personally knows victims of such attacks and was also almost a victim myself, I find this attitude deplorable and does nothing to help the cause of those who suffer through these attacks.<br /><br />So in point form, here are the first 10 things that spring to mind as to what is wrong with this particular book.<br /><br />1.  After 12 books of having it said repeatedly by Sookie that Sam is ONLY her friend/boss/older brother type, she all of a sudden finds herself in love with him?<br /><br />2.  After `making love' for the first time, Sookie's internal monologue muses if this was only so great because of the magic of the C.D. and that she really doesn't care nor does it matter.  Excuse me??  This coming from the woman who spent several BOOKS upset and fighting the bond between her and Eric because she believed it was only the magic of the bond that caused their love for eachother.  It annoyed her so greatly that she had the bond broken and discovered that she did in fact love Eric, `all on her own'.<br /><br />3.  It was also stated repeatedly throughout the series that Sookie believed she would never be able to be with a non-vampire due to her telepathy.  While shifters and Were's were more difficult to read, they weren't impossible.  This had caused such an issue for her that she was still a virgin until vampires came along.  Suddenly, in this last book, it's stated she only reads their emotions, going directly against everything CH had stated in her books up to this point.<br /><br />4.  Sookie did not want children as she was afraid of passing along her telepathy.  Actually, she wanted children, she just decided to not have any due to the reason stated.  Now she's supposedly running off into the sunset with someone to have children with and while improbable, it's still a possibility her children, or at least her oldest child, will be a shifter...... another `curse' she didn't want to spring on her children<br /><br />5.  In a previous book, Sookie asked the question if her telepathy could be removed and was told that it could not.  Removing it would be like removing a vital organ.  All of a sudden, Niall offers to remove it for her so she might be able to lead a normal life?  Again, NOT what was previously established.<br /><br />6.  Eric is a 1000 year old Viking vampire.  He's supposedly quite scary and strong.  This glorious man was tortured for the first years of his vampire years by his vampire master and finally earned his freedom, siring his own children he `raised in love', building his businesses etc.  Now however, he has been banned from his children, his businesses, his love and his life, and is essentially being forced into roll of arm candy and slave for 200.<br /><br />7.  Eric stated several times he would NOT turn Sookie against her will.  Yet in this final book, Eric tells her he wished he had.<br /><br />8.  Sookie was raped by Bill.  There's no pretty way to put it really.  Bill.  Raped.  Sookie.  And how did the author handle this?  Sookie and Bill kiss, Sookie ponders how nice it is, they become buddies and she asks advice of him!  I know many victims of sexual crimes and this one point alone sickens them.<br /><br />9.  This series has the word Dead in every title, a nod to the vampires contained within.  By the end, they are simply filler and no growth is achieved for any of them.<br /><br />10.  It's well known that the vampires in this series were a metaphor for the struggles experienced by homosexuals and other minority groups.  How then do we interoperate the way these people have been handled:  it is best to stick with your own kind as equality can never be achieved.  One set of rules for you, and another for everyone else.<br /><br />In the end, I find myself extremely disappointed by a book that I had long looked forward to not only due to sloppy writing, but sloppy craftsmanship.<br /><br />Suddenly, Twilight doesn't look so bad.
B0015AARJI|5.0|good
B00BGGIW2K|5.0|At first i was disappointed because all of the hype was due to the first two songs \\"the fall\\" and \\"open\\" but as i began to listen to the record more and more i found myself enjoying every single one of their songs. This record is my all time fav for the year 2013 so far.<br />Def worth the buy!!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome. It's kinda like temple run. Just a little more punk style. I like it and it's really fun. If you download it you will probably like it. Also it's kinda addicting. Once you play it you want to keep playing it.

0545265355|4.0|I admit I was a little behind the curve on Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy - OK, I was way behind the curve - but I have a feeling these books are going to stick around for a while, even though they were originally cast as young adult reading.<br /><br />First, the details. The three books are, in order, \\"The Hunger Games\\" (Scholastic, $8.99, 374 pages), \\"Catching Fire\\" (Scholastic, $17.99, 391 pages), and \\"Mockingjay\\" (Scholatic, $17.99, 390 pages). They are all set in a post-apocalyptic United States ruled by the Capitol, which is somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. The Capitol still has access to the luxuries of the early 21st century, and is in some ways more advanced, but a global war and climate change have pushed the rest of the country to the edge of starvation.<br /><br />The plot - and it is necessary to read the books in order - follows Katniss Everdeen, a teen-age girl from one of the poorer districts in what's known as Panem, as she finds herself thrust into national prominence through the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are one of the tools by which the Capitol keeps control over the impoverished nation, and they are like the reality TV show \\"Survivor\\", except for the fact that the only way to lose is to be killed during the competition.<br /><br />Naturally, it's televised, and the winner, a true survivor, becomes a national hero, and the district from which he or she comes is given more food for the next year. The other districts, as always, must get by on not nearly enough.<br /><br />At the same time, Katniss is struggling with her feelings for two boys, Gale and Peeta, and the process of resolving this love triangle is a major theme of the series. More interesting to me, however, were Collins' deeper messages that her young adult audience couldn't help but absorb along the way.<br /><br />First, \\"Panem\\" means \\"bread\\" in Latin, and comes from the phrase \\"panem et circenses,\\" or \\"bread and circuses\\" - the method by which Roman emperors controlledthe proletariat in their capital city. The idea was that the emperors would drain the rest of the empire of grain to feed those in the capital, and would keep them occupied with circuses, entertainments and gladiators so that they wouldn't revolt.<br /><br />To hammer this point home, Collins uses Roman names almost exclusively for citizens of Capitol (Cinna, Caesar, etc.), and makes it clear that this is an imperial state. She also makes it clear that this imperial state is tyrannical and uninterested in anything except its own survival - and its own luxury. Collins includes scenes familiar to those who have studied Roman history: Elegant banquets with too much food in the midst of starvation; rooms where guests vomit up the early courses in a banquet so they can eat more; and so on.<br /><br />Collins also emphasizes an alternate kind of capital, this one the basis of an economic system that, in these books, ravaged the earth and left it but a shadow of the productive planet it once had been. She makes it clear that capitalism still is a major force in the world of the trilogy, and even more clear that the combination of capitalism and imperialism can easily lead to an ugly, degraded earth and a barbaric, poverty-stricken nation such as Panem.<br /><br />But these themes don't come close to overwhelming the narrative arc of Katniss, her battles in the Hunger Games, her choice of boyfriends and the struggle for justice in Panem, all of which combine to make this series one that easily breaks out of the young adult genre. All scifi fans should find plenty to enjoy in the Hunger Games' trilogy, and readers who are starting the books now, or five years from now, will feel their money has been well spent.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|First things first. Time is flat out the best album Rod Stewart has put forth in 25 years. To say he's found his voice after 40 years in the music business, and after crafting some of rock's finest songs, would be ludicrous. But he seems to have found a very strong second wind as a songwriter. And the material produced by this late career songcraft sounds like the Rod Stewart of old--only different. There are some familiar phrases and themes but it's clearly an older, wiser, and perhaps even happier Rod Stewart who's telling the stories and making the observations. While several songs on Time recall other Stewart songs, the album itself is like no other Stewart album. Rod and his musical partner Kevin Savigar have produced a rich collection of original songs--with one cover--to create a superb album that Rod Stewart fans--old and young--are going to soon place among the top ten albums of Stewart's career.<br /><br />Time is not Gasoline Alley or Every Picture Tells a Story or even Out of Order. Nor should it be. Rod and Co. might tell you it is, but that's nothing more than Rod selling records. (Remember all those myths that were dispelled in \\"Rod: The Autobiography\\"? Who do you think started and/or perpetuated all of them?) Time is a modern day Rod Stewart album--it does feature electronic instrumentation, Pro Tools, drum machines, overdubs, etc. on a few tracks. But Stewart and Savigar never let these get in the way. The productions enhance, they do not detract. Stewart and Savigar know it's neither 1971 nor 1986.<br /><br />Oh, and the voice itself--it's nearly as good as ever. Definitely older, definitely weaker (don't believe me--go find a live recording from about 1984 and compare) but still full of charisma, and capable of so much feeling and emotion. At 68 he still can rock fairly hard--at least in the studio, and break our hearts on his marvelous ballads. I've stopped guessing how long Rod Stewart the singer is going to be around. I'm starting to assume--and hope--it's forever. But the best news of all is that Rod the singer, for now, has his best songwriter back.<br />See more at rodstewartblog period com.
