0812979656|5.0|Arundhati Roy expressed the subject sentiment several times throughout this superlative novel, and demonstrates how one singular devastating event can impact and collapse the lives of numerous individuals. Roy is a marvelous story-teller. She says that it took her four years to write the novel and in the process the characters became more real than the so-called real world. And I can believe it. She reveals certain facts about a character, and then backs and fills across time, revealing more, so that the character's actions on that fateful day, and the aftermath, seem to be inevitable. At one point in the novel, the author describes the thin line of hair, extending downward from the navel of her female protagonist, which is like the shaft of an arrow, leading downward to that more substantive arrowhead, pointing the direction, \\"for inexperienced lovers.\\" Likewise, there was a narrative arrow throughout this finely polished novel, pointing the direction to the denouement.<br /><br />This is a novel of India, in all its glorious complexity. Fittingly, it starts with the monsoon of page 1, the meteorological phenomenon that has so largely shaped the country. Most of the novel is set in Kerala, the very green southwestern state, which has a far higher percentage of Christians (and in more recent times, Marxists) than the rest of the country. Ammu decides to forgo the traditional arranged marriage, seeks her fate via Bombay and an ill-starred love marriage to a man who would become an alcoholic wife-beater. He takes a position as the manager on a tea plantation in Assam, in the far northeast of India, and there the twins, Estha and Rahel are born. The twins are principal characters throughout the story. Ammu's brother Chacko has a scholarship to Oxford, where he marries an Englishwoman, Margaret, and they have a daughter, Sophie Mol. Both Ammu and Chacko divorce their spouses and return to the ancestral home in Kerala. The reader learns in the first few pages that Sophie Mol dies in India a few days after arriving on her first visit. And it is that death that truly changes the lives of the other characters.<br /><br />Complementing her literary abilities, Roy is a social activist. In this novel she addresses that somewhat unique and most invidious Indian problem: the cast system. True, almost all societies seem to evolve a hierarchical structure, but in India the cast system seem to be more formal and rigid, lurking just below the surface in a democratic society.  Another principal character is Velutha, a Paravan, a caste considered \\"untouchable.\\" In the not so distant past, the Paravans had to crawl backwards, erasing their footprints, with a broom. Roy also critically examines the status of women in Indian society, particularly those unlucky enough to become divorced. And although the British ruled India, officially and not, for a long time, their impact on the country is barely noted. A far more dominant theme is \\"globalization,\\" though \\"call centers\\" are never mentioned. For example: Chacko's already cited Oxford scholarship; Rahel spends a brief period working behind bullet-proof glass in a convenience store in Washington, DC, receiving crude propositions; the family cook, Kochu Maria, has her inner spirit meeting the \\"soaps\\" and Hulk Hogan, of the World Wrestling Federation; and the Cochin airport scene is filled with the \\"guest workers,\\" somewhat wealthier, returning from their jobs in the Gulf. In terms of the leadership in political power struggles, Roy sardonic view of the Communist leader, Comrad Pillai: \\"...what he really needed was the process of war more than the outcome of victory. War could have been the stallion the he rode, part of, if not all, the way to the Legislative Assembly...\\" Or other observations: \\"Civilization's fear of nature, power's fear of powerlessness... police beating was exorcising fear.\\" \\"It was human history, masquerading as God's purpose.\\"<br /><br />Roy's prose is luxurious. Consider: \\"The slow ceiling fan sliced the thick, frightened air into an unending spiral that spun slowly to the floor like the peeled skin of an endless potato.\\" Or: \\"...hovering the knolls and dells of his memory...\\" Her societal critiques are incisive, for example: \\"A war that we have won and lost. The very worst sort of war. A war that has made us adore our conquerors and despise ourselves.\\" \\"Marry our conquerors, is more like it,\\" Ammu dryly said, referring to Margaret...\\" And there is much, much else, including how Roy worked in the movie \\"The Sound of Music,\\" a backdrop for another seminal event, as it were, in the novel.<br /><br />Roy justly won the Man Booker Award in 1997 for her debut novel. I am stunned by the number of 1-star reviews which can only be partial explained by the fact that it is now a \\"school assignment novel.\\" Now that Alice Munro has justly won the Nobel Prize, when does Roy start making the \\"short list\\"? The answer should be the last word in the novel: \\"tomorrow.\\"  6-stars.ow ceiling fan sliced the thick, frightened air into an unending spiral that spun slowly to the floor like the peeled skin of an endless potato.\\" Or: \\"...hovering the knolls and dells of his memory...\\" Her societal critiques are incisive, for example: \\"A war that we have won and lost.

B00BAXFACO|5.0|Not being a big fan of fiction, somewhere along the line, Mr. Connelly became a favorite of mine and after pre ordering the book in February the latest of his work was inhaled with relish.<br />Harry Bosch makes a cameo appearance and that just adds frosting to the cake. Also the ebook offers a chance to easily obtain a free PDF short story gift featuring Harry.<br />Now we probably will need to spend another year awaiting the next thriller.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game, very challenging.  It keeps me busy.  Passes the time when waiting for appointments, etc. Different levels keep it from being boring.
B00E4UDDHO|5.0|This album should be considered a must have if you have a record collection.  Prepare yourself for an audiological acid trip!
B00AEFYWJG|5.0|It is just as I remembered it.<br />Great movie..<br />I wish Amazon didn't count words.<br />If I didn't have to use so many words, I'd write more reviews.
B00GSAC1UI|4.0|I am a big fan of acapella, and tight harmonies.  All of the young people in this group have wonderful voices on their own, and blend so smoothly together.  Some of the selections are a little &#34;modern&#34; for me personally, but all done quite well.  I love Christmas music and Pentatonix adds a new flavor to some traditional pieces.  I would highly recommend this music to everyone.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Another incredible effort, but I may be a little biased as they are my favorite band. The songs build and flow, some with gritty anger and others with simple melodies. Saw their show in Oakland. They played for almost 3 1/2 hours. Pulled some lesser known songs from their past and filled it out with several from Lightning Bolt.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|it was sold to me as it said in the ad.and hubby will love it when he opens it on xmas..thank you
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Really enjoying this book. Dawkins takes the time to explain some basic things that you might have missed in your education. I read alot of these kinds of books, but already, after a few chapters, I have learned alot.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|What can one say, a truly classic story from a great author. A must read for kids off all ages.
0989524140|5.0|I’m excited that the author left a hint at the end of the book that there might be more because I had such a great time with these books. Outmove was my favorite of the three. Legg managed to wrap up all the far-reaching threads of the story while leaving us with just a glimmer of a hope that there might be another book coming one day. Bring it!

I don't know if it will work, but I'm trying to eliminate the foods that are bad for my brain according to Dr. Perlmutter. He is a godsend. I just wish this book would have come out about ten years ago, maybe my Dad would be better off today.<br />He gives you a true/false self assessment test in the beginning of the book. I've written these questions down and carry them around with me to remind me how to take better care not to get Alzheimer's.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm not normally a tech impulse buyer and the TV commercial wasn't real clear on what the Chromecast can do. I figured, however, it was worth $35 to find out. It doesn't replace a Roku or Apple TV. It streams specific content including You-Tube, Hulu, Netflix and Google Play from your smartphone or tablet to be displayed on your HD TV screen. It will also stream web pages from Chrome on your desktop - as long as these all have a wireless network connection. It was confusing to set up (I'm in my late 50's) but we got there and it has been worth it. My wife is thrilled that she can watch the season of Sons of Anarchy that she bought, on the big screen instead of just her tablet screen.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|She keeps evolving, like a real artist does. And she is, indeed, a real artist.<br /><br />'The Fame' was great. It was an introduction to Gaga. And it was fun. As we got to know her more, you could tell that her label strong-armed the product. Fine. This is what happens to everyone when they're signed. That's the business. 'The Fame Monster' came out - darker, deeper. A more intense look into who she was. 'Born This Way' enabled her to have more control, and you could hear this in the more avante-gard dance tracks and lyrics, and you could hear more of a Bitter End Gaga, which was pretty cool. Her roots! 'Artpop'?! I'm astounded by her vocals (studio AND live, which is sadly a rarity today. Please listen to her interview on Stern.), the production choices, the lyrics are more introspective and the subject matters and their presentations are unique. She keeps getting better and better.<br /><br />Why do I say she's underrated? Most of this, unfortunately, may be her own fault. I say that because, yes, while she changes her wigs and costumes every couple of minutes on stage, wears whacked out makeup, rides a horse into award shows, sadly, she gets grouped into the same category as the Rihannas, Katy Perrys, Madonnas and Xtinas (no one's denying that Xtina can sing, but she doesn't have the facilities that Gaga has. I've studied the business, music and voice for years, including with the man who is both Gaga's and Xtina's coach - I know what I'm talking about, people. Even Adele. Yes, she sells and went diamond, but all her songs are about the same thing and you do not get nodes if you know how to sing) and forget to listen to her musical talent. And the woman's got boatloads of talent. No one has to be a fan of anything or anyone, but at least check her out. She's quality.<br /><br />'Artpop' is a fantastic piece of work. I'm excited to watch her continue her growth.

(3 meters)<br /><br />By the third day i disconnected the iPad and the lightning charger came off from the cable and stayed inside the docking part of the iPad<br /><br />needless to say, that was the end of my love relationship and it turned into disappointment.<br /><br />could not believe it, what a shame, griffin used to be very good in their products but this left me doubting
B00CX7TOOG|4.0|Now this film has two great actors and I found it excellent. It was intense and I think anyone would enjoy it it is not a war movie... and the two characters who did meet during a war - continues their battle in the heartland of America in the mountains... I really think you will love it. Now if they would have put BEN STILLER OR JUSTIN BEIBER in it I'd say pass! Cause BEN is overplayed he's in everything... and no one can stand Justin... but this is a safe bet with some action and its very realistic... loved it.
B002X063OC|3.0|You know, I liked Lady Gaga at first, but I feel like now she is just trying to piss off people and that affects the quallty of her music (in my opinion)

B0099114WO|3.0|Literally so boring I had to turn it off. She was sex I think he doesn't  I think... and so on and so one and bore, bore, bore. I was shocked and surprised. If you got anything from this film you should be on OPRAH and explain it all to the rest of us who fell into depression watching it.

0767819659|5.0|Loved it even though it is for kids... you can't go wrong... you don't have to worry that something inappropriate is going to pop up when you are out of the room... it was funny and sweet. More kids should have a film like this in their collection. And I think it is more for girls than boys - though a young boy say 3 - 6 might enjoy it. I liked it better than ANNIE. Though ANNIE has been redone several times. I wish they would have made part two to this watching Madeline grow up. Another movie good like this was MATILIDA. Danny DeVito... was in that....

B0028IDXDS|5.0|Everyone should have these pacifiers!  They are perfect for babies who don't quite have a strong sucking grip and when they fall, they are easier to find (no rolling under the sofa!).  Throw in washing machine then rinse any soap residue off pacifier.  Very durable.  When my son was 1 year, I cut the paci off the mouth of the monkey and handed it to him when he went to bed...He started to put it in his mouth then realized the pacifier was gone then he just squeezed the monkey and laid down!  No more paci after that day and no issues!

B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|Having been to Australia many times this was particularly interesting. Not sure why I didn't give it five stars, amybe because it seemed longer than it need to be ??
B00DVPN30A|3.0|Love the voice, love the songs except for the profanity on one song. It is as good as Mission Bell and the variety of songs makes it good company.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent storyline.  Well rounded characters.  I like the little side stories that keep you guessing about what's going to happen.
B00G4Q3KOC|2.0|This film is indeed the \\"Schindler's List\\" of slavery. Whether that is a positive or a negative, you be the judge; but one can tell by the star rating how I mean it.<br /><br />I was so, so disappointed in 12 Years a Slave. I have always rooted for director Steve McQueen for taking on important issues, but every pitfall that possibly awaited him in making this film, he succeeded in stepping into. Self-important, self-righteous, steeped in modern-day race politics (a lot has happened between now and when slavery occurred, making the film a strange experience and giving it an untruthful ring); and, devolving in the end into a politically correct feel-good fest, it perhaps apes its projenitor in Schindler's List a little TOO closely. For a truer representation of the subject matter, see McQueen's own Hunger, which although avoiding the race-baiting and the American slavery history, succeeds in being a clarion for universal human rights.<br /><br />Let's hope that Mcqueen runs and doesn't walk to the nearest exit away from Brad Pitt and his production company.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Love the Eagles and this DVD let's you see them in a down and dirty, no holds bar way, for a great price I might add.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Easy way to pass time while waiting for something/someone. For lots of ages! Don't be frustrated by lack of lives, just wait for your time to be up. You'll enjoy the game more if you don't get sucked in to feeling like you have to pass a level right away.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Works wonderful!! I love this headset! Microphone quality is great, and gaming surround is perfect. You won't be disappointed with this headset.

B008JFUPK8|2.0|Man of Steel is, technically, the first movie reboot of the Superman mythos since 1978's Superman: The Movie. Produced by the Christopher Nolan, written by David Goyer and directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), it's an attempt to bring the moral ambiguity and 'grittiness' of Nolan and Goyer's Dark Knight trilogy of Batman films to the Superman franchise, and set up a new shared universe of films based on DC comics characters.<br /><br />Things start promisingly with a visit to Krypton, depicted as something between Avatar (the Cameron movie) and Dune, with a mixture of ultra-advanced technology and feuding nobles. Russell Crowe plays Jor-El, here depicted as a scientist trying to save his world from imminent destruction but, in typical Russell Crowe style, is also capable of laying waste to entire platoons of soldiers single-handedly. Crow runs afoul of Michael Shannon's General Zod during a coup but still manages to blast his infant son (eventually a capable and reasonably good Henry Cavill) into space before the planet explodes. Zod and his cohorts are sentenced to eternal imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, which works out about as well as it ever does.<br /><br />The infant Kal-El arrives on Earth and is found and raised by Kent family near Smallville, Kansas. Kal-El aka Clark's crazy powers and abilities soon manifest and his human parents (ably played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) are soon spending their time running around quashing rumours that their son is a space alien and instilling him with noble human values. Clark attempts to lie low in a number of fairly innocuous jobs but his tendency to rush into dangerous situations to rescue people soon attracts the attention of a reporter, Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Clark discovers a Kryptonian ship which he can use with technology from his own crashed vessel to create an interactive AI based on his father's personality. This allows him to learn about his heritage, but also sends out an automated SOS which lures Zod and his crazy crew to the planet. Cue a lot of carnage as showdown follows showdown until the film climaxes.<br /><br />The storyline is, in principle, a good idea. The film avoids any mention of Lex Luthor or Kryptonite, and the use of Krypton, Zod and Jor-El as an AI are all good notions that give the story a personal investment for Superman whilst allowing the origin story part of the narrative to flow into the actual present-day storyline. Unfortunately, this doesn't work out in practise. The film's first hour, just under half the total running time, is overwhelmed by backstory and exposition. The Krypton sequences with Russell Crowe are pretty good, with a strong visual identity and Crowe - easily the best performer in the movie - doing some excellent work, grounding the fantastical landscapes and events in more relatable issues of family. Michael Shannon is a bit thuggish and lacking in nuance as Zod (especially as the film goes on and he gets more shouty), but he has credible motivations and presence. The Krypton sequence is imaginative and involving, but also overlong.<br /><br />Once on Earth, the film becomes a confused morass of flashbacks (many of them pretty pointless) and present-day story. Kevin Costner is very good as Superman's human father, right up until he gets what is, by a considerable distance, the stupidest, most pointless and most unconvincing death scene in the history of cinema. The overwhelming stupidity of this sequence, not to mention that it was completely unnecessary, may be the film's lowest point. Some individual sequences such as Superman saving the crew of an oil rig or learning to fly by first jumping really high (a nod to early versions of the character who couldn't fly at all, only jump miles at a time) are much more successful. Amy Adams's Lois Lane, who soon enters the story, is also really good. She plays Lois as a smart, intelligent reporter in her thirties who is more plausible than other takes on the character. Crucially, she is also aware of who Superman is from the off. This is an obviously different take on the character relationship, avoiding the whole 'wears glasses as a disguse' cliche, even if it makes no sense whatsoever (Perry meets Superman but later falls for the old 'glasses' trick hook, line and sinker). But still, points for trying on that score. More disappointing is that Adams and Cavill don't really have much chemistry, and their eventual romance is utterly unconvincing.<br /><br />The film continues to try hard to succeed: Zod's plans for Earth are actually somewhat logical and make sense. They also give hope to Clark that one day Krypton can live again, which should lead to greater moral confusion over what is the right thing to do. But this never happens: Clark decides early on to defend Earth no matter the cost and never budges from that, making these attempts to complicate things fail outright.<br /><br />This leads into the film's climactic action sequences which are, on the whole, highly disappointing. The action sequences are over-indulgent and seem to go on forever. They also frequently lack context or conviction: seeing two invulnerable beings fight one another knowing they can't hurt one another makes for zero tension. The CGI is also flat-out terrible in these battles, rather bafflingly since Krypton is so impressive at the start of the film. The character-replacement CGI is unconvincing, the placing of the actors' faces on CGI bodies is amateurish and some of the flight and movement CGI is worse than the twelve-year-old original Spider-Man movie. Usually in 2013 the very least you can say about an otherwise terrible movie is that the effects are good, but Man of Steel can't even manage that right. The final battle also indulges in some dubiously lingering shots of collapsing skyscrapers with hundreds of people in them (or about to be squashed by them) which makes for uneasy viewing in a Superman feature.<br /><br />Man of Steel (**) shows hints of a fertile imagination and originality (mostly in the opening act set on Krypton) whilst showcasing a few good performances, but these are soon buried by inane dialogue, terrible action sequences, poor CGI and a total collapse in logic at several key points in the film. Man of Steel is not only not very good, but even manages to make Superman Returns look like a capable and competent film in comparison. Overall, not recommended.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|First two books are fantastic.<br />I read the books before watching the movie and felt that a lot of the details portrayed in the books was missing and disjointed in the movies. Read the books even if you've seen the movie to better grasp the premise and backgrounds.<br />Last book was a little slow, maybe drawn out a bit too much so I deducted a star from the ratings.

1478951508|4.0|It took awhile to understand the relationships among all the characters; however, once you understand the dynamics involved, it is an interesting but sad story.  It is interesting how one man's death impacts so many people in unexpected ways.  It also makes one ponder the many challenges/struggles in people's lives that are not evident from appearance only.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Best app ever you should get it you will love it this is a very good game for little kids.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|PERFECT!! The CD was exactly as I expected from the sellers website.  Order was processed efficiently and quickly. Very, very happy customer!  I know that my son will be very happy to get this for Christmas this year.

B00138KJY0|5.0|&#34;Off the Wall&#34; by Michael Jackson was a very pleasing experience.  Just listening to this album on my mpg player loads me with memories and joy.  Memories of being in the backyard grilling, dancing in the screen house, music blasting &#34;Rock with You&#34; all night long.  There were warm summer nights, dipping in the pool, under soft summer lights. singing out of tune and no one cared.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The method of narration was remarkable. I will read this again and again over the years I am given. Positively powerful.
0375869026|5.0|This book is amazing. It is great for encouraging kids to read. This is a book that will teach your child about compassion. As you can tell, I read it too... this is one of the best children's' books I have read.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It wasn't the read I expected but more than I could have imagined.  It is so nice to find out how Danny Torrance faired in life and what became of him.  I couldn't put it down. Definitely a page turner from start to finish.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. Lindsey Stirling is an amazing artist and has created very interesting music. Definitely not what you would expect from a violinist!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|While the acting in this movie was superb, i was disappointed in the amount of time spent on the political machinations, rather than the character study of Lincoln himself, and his personal relationships.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Kind of bored just wanted a game to play suuuuppppeeerrrrr addicting :) love it!!! Easy to play, ok graphics, but overall good
0811870413|5.0|Best bakers book around. This beautiful book has gorgeous pictures and explains expertly on the baking methods of tartine bread. Excellent buy, beautiful beautiful beautiful!
B00CISC2DA|4.0|More like Geogaddi than the Campfire Headphase, this album has more gloom than brightness. Still deserves to be listened to
0316187208|1.0|This book is unreadable. Period. Joe Abercrombie embarrassed himself writing this drivel. Not only does he demonstrate his ignorance about westerns in general, he seems to take a personal, and I mean personal, delight in including every darn cliche in the genre. Nothing original here and on top of that, he did not even write it with the style everyone enjoyed in his first four books.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|A great tool for the price, works great with my iPad mini, and I look forward to it adding compatability to more apps.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Great stuff. Will watch again, even though I typically never like movies where people get their guts ripped out. Strange how that can be funny.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Is a fun match three game that anyone can play. The limited lives are a bit disappointing, but all these types of games seem to have that same limitation. I don't get overly involved and just play the lives out and come back when they regenerate.
078322947X|5.0|This is a dark tale of men who cannot escape the consequences of bad choices.<br />One of my favorite movies.  I have both the French movie The Wages of Fear and The American movie Sorcerer, and I'll choose Sorcerer every time although both are good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not a genre I usually read, so I was a little reluctant to give The Hunger Games a try, even though it got so many 5 star reviews, but it was totally deserving of every one of them!  This book was so good, I couldn't put it down! I totally got lost in the story. Definitely recommend!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Love this guy and his teaching. Following  the  recommendations in this book as well as Wheat Belly will change the way you look at food. I have lost 30 pounds and off all meds. No more heartburn!  Our body is not designed to eat gluten. The food table is upside down. Carbs are not your friend.
B00DNB9RXO|3.0|Seems a great game. But even after trying the different control options, I just can't get it right. Also there's no music?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day by Mark Owen (not his real name for his and families protection) and Kevin Maurer have written an amazing book.  The book gives you an inside look at the world of the Navy Seals.  These warriors train and fight on the cutting edge of our military forces.  The book not only describes the assault that took down Bin Laden but also other missions as well in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The book does an incredible job at showing you the<br />blow-by-blow narrative of the assault that killed Bin Laden, beginning with the helicopter crash straight through to the radio call confirming Bin Laden’s death.  The detail is simply unprecedented, their are even maps of the compound where Bin Laden lived.  I cannot speak high enough for this book and the warrior that live this life so we can stay safe.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B0083Q4NCO|5.0|I loved the fact of it being a sturdy hardback book as far as the reading my daughter had to read it for  school. She likes it.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Red is great popcorn fun that I think you will enjoy.  The movie stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban, and very funny John Malkovich.  The movie is directed by Robert Schwentke, who previously directed The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan.  The plot of the movie Frank (Bruce Willis) is retired, bored and lonely living off his government pension in a nondescript suburb in an equally nondescript house. The only joy in Frank's life are his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker Sarah (Mary-Louis Parker).  Sarah is as bored and lonely as Frank and marks her conversations with the unknown Frank and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life. When something in Frank's past forces Frank back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting Sarah in the middle of the intrigue, Frank and Sarah begin a journey into Franks past and the people he used to work with. Like Frank they are all RED ... Retired Extremely Dangerous.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and I think you will too.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This has to be the best game  ive ever played on kindle, the graphics are amazing<br />and its almost like the console version
0316055433|5.0|This is the best book Donna Tartt has written I think.  She writes like a modern day Dickens.  The story is enthralling and the characters so believable and true to life.  I wish the book had been even longer than it was.  I purposely put it down for awhile so I wouldn't get to the end so quickly.  I think this is probably the best book I have read in a long while.
B005AUWY90|5.0|my two great grandsons love cars so what a perfect Christmas gift for those 2 cute little boys they will love it
B000P0J09M|5.0|Goodfellas is such a good movie that I wish I could rate it than 5 stars.  Since Amazon only goes up to 5 stars I'll have to settle for only 5 stars. This movies is a classic and is not only a great crime thiller but also a great movie under any genre.  Goodfellas features the amazing acting of Robert Deniro.<br /><br />Goodfellas is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese. It is a film adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film follows the rise and fall of Lucchese crime family through the eyes of a Lucchese associate, Henry Hill. The movie covers the period of time from 1955 to 1980. The movie features the great acting of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino. Goodfellas was nominated for the Academy Award in the following categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor (Joe Pesci, who won).<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00GINENG0|5.0|My kid loves it & i quite enjoy leveling up my Tom. I have it both on the Kindle Fire & my phone. Very cute! Plus, i can make it look just like my real black & white kitty.
B00GIXY4M8|5.0|That was freaking awesome. I'm not a comic reader but I sure have enjoyed these Xmen movies. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good story and lots of action. It almost seems like a Wolverine side quest.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Five Stars!!!!!!! Absolutely loved it!!!! The characters make you fall in love with them, can't wait to read the next book!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell is a great book that looks at what makes individuals successful.  The book argues that the true story of success is very different, and that if we want to understand how some people thrive, we should spend more time looking at an individuals family, their birthplace, or even their birth date.  The author presents a new way of looking at why people may or may not become successful.  I very much enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00B1RB942|4.0|Anime is usually a niche entertainment, but there are those anime movies that transcend the genre and become movies that everyone can enjoy. Mamoru Hosoda's \\"Summer Wars\\" is one such film. It's not just a great anime movie; it's a great movie period.<br /><br />I first saw \\"Summer Wars\\" recently in the best possible way: knowing little to nothing about it. Heck, I didn't even know it existed until a an acquaintance mentioned it. So, based solely on that, I got it from Netlix, watched it and man, did I enjoy the heck out of it. I even bought it!<br /><br />Okay, enough about me, let's discuss the movie itself. To put it in the simplest terms, \\"Summer Wars\\" is a combination of family drama and cyber thriller. It's every family gathering movie you've ever seen, but done a million times better mixed with \\"War Games\\" and \\"Tron\\" (as well as a segment from \\"Digimon: The Movie\\" which was also directed by Hosoda). As crazy as that sounds, it actually works! The reason is because not only is the thriller stuff, well, thrilling, we also love this family.<br /><br />The Jinnouchi Clan is a very large, extended family with a colorful history and tonsof personality. [Granted, there are so many of them that it does get confusing as to how each person is related to the other (the protagonist's reaction after he's introduced to each member is spot on), but hey, that's the way it is in real life as well.] The wise old matriarch (who has one of the movie's best scenes) and the fish market owner who is very proud of his family's background and is always willing to tell tales of his ancestors are my favorites, but everyone is charming and memorable in their own way. The movie may be a thriller on the surface, but they are the true heart of the film.<br /><br />Of course, I can't talk about an animated film without mentioning the animation and man is it gorgeous. Both the virtual Tron-like world  and the countryside setting that most of \\"Summer Wars\\" takes place in are beautiful to lookat.<br /><br />Is \\"Summer Wars\\" a perfect movie? Not at all. The first 20 minutes run a bit slow (this is mainly due to character introductions so it's not too big of a deal) and there were a few scenes that made me roll my eyes, but that's honestly more nitpicking than anything else. When all is said and done,  \\"Summer Wars\\" is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in quite some time, anime or not.
0525952926|5.0|This historical novel is full of vibrant characters who take you on an effortless adventure through the post WW 1 era.  Its nearly 1000 pages are eminently readable. At its conclusion I suspect most readers will be eagerly awaiting Book Three of Follett's Century Trilogy.
0143113100|3.0|good book for overall review. If you are looking for practical application advises - look somewhere else for deeper research.
B005COO1X6|5.0|As a King fan, I was not disappointed. If you are familiar with his writing, then you already know how this book is heading.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|I have the first part of the 20/20 experience and liked it a lot, so when the second one came out I was thinking I'd have to get it too. I'm glad I did!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Thor was a favorite comic of mine as a youth so to me the movie was great. I think the movie has enough action and adventure to entertain anyone even though you might only give it 4 stars. :-)
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|I like Victorian horror, and this definitely fits the bill. The subject matter (children killing themselves) is a little disturbing (especially since the first time I saw this I was pregnant) but it isn't overly in your face. I was glad to see this type of horror making a come back, as I'm sick of the stupid teens get picked off or psychological-gore driven stuff that has become popular now.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Well written, a slice of life of how that all was not as we expected and brings todays events as not so different.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Wish there could have been more pictures.  I love to see my city in such a positive way.  You showed all of its kinks, quirks as well as it's serious sides.  There is nothing more beautiful than my city shown in dazzling color.
B000Q67876|5.0|This was one of Steven King's best books. Then making it into a movie for me was great, even with the customary differences, I loved the movie.
B005KPDAN4|5.0|SSD are the future. What good is 16 gig of ram, a 5 core processor, etc etc, when you are bottle necked at the HDD??
0764169742|5.0|An in depth study which finally tells me somethings that other books just don't seem to get to.  I am following the book page by page and doing all the exercises as I think it is that good.
B0060D11OU|5.0|This classic movie with extravagant dance numbers and little twists were great for my 2 year old who stayed enraptured of the movie for the majority of it.  In these days of short 20 minute bursts of young entertainment it was nice to see something that could keep him sated for an extended period.  Especially appropriate with &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; coming out about the relationship between Walt Disney and P.L. Tavers, the lady that wrote the Mary Poppins book.
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|Really good results. Not as good as an i7, but it blows my old AMD Radeon out of the water.
1604680547|5.0|I never thought there were so many easy motifs I could sew in a quilt.  I'm sewing like crazy!  It's amazing how much fun I'm having with this book's help.  Happy to have ordered it.

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I like this app pretty well, it comes in really handy for doing different various notebook things; would download again.
B007EW9ISM|1.0|Based on the reviews I purchased this stylus. I'm always on the make for a new one to use. I love the size of this stylus and because of this I was interested. I have arthritis in my hands and a fatter stylus makes gripping and holding so much less painful and easier. But I can't make this stylus work to save my life. I have tried it on my iPad Air housed in my Griffin Survivor case and outside of the case too. No matter which way I hold this thing or how light or hard I press my iPad will not read the tip. I so wanted to love this stylus but am very disappointed considering the cost and it won't work at all on my devices. I just don't understand it, it's not rocket science but this thing will not read on my touch screens. Avoid it.
0545265355|5.0|My son loves the series that he wanted to own the books even though he had already read them from the library. They shipped fast, arrived in excellent condition, and look classy on the shelf. Thank you!

B006GWO5NE|5.0|I needed this for my computer; I am always needing all kinds of cords as a tech geek and this fit the bill.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This injustice version only compliments the console version &amp; I'm enjoying it very much &amp; it's also very good-looking mobile version thanks WB for injustice on the go...
B00BAXFACO|5.0|Once again, I'm reminded why Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors! I hate to use the old cliche ,but for lack of better words-I just could not put this book down. I highly recommend this because it is classic Connelly! Well written and interesting from beginning to end!
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|One of our favorite family movies. This one has it all. Action, comedy, suspense, family values, and more. The only word I remember not enjoying is when the father said something &#34;sucked&#34;. Overall, it's a family film I don't mind watching over and over as some kids tend to do. Having 3D is fun too!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing and creative!! Can't wait to start the next book! I think I may have found my new favorite author.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a no brainer, got it as a gift for my best friend, pretty certain he loved it as he has always been a fan of the franchise.

B00BD62X14|3.0|&#34;Little French Songs&#34; does not measure up to her earlier works.  My favorite Carla Bruni album is still her first one, &#34;Quelqu'un m'a dit&#34;.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|Fun and funny, and very close to home. Anyone who is in service to a feline will get a laugh out of it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down! It was not predictable which I loved. I'm curious to read Travis's point of view to see if I like it as much as this one.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is the first book that I've read by Mira Lyn Kelly. I enjoyed this book. She did a good job of character development and also with the storyline considering that the Harlequin Kiss series has a shorter format.<br /><br />Megan and Connor quickly come to the decision to marry after meeting in Las Vegas. Megan has second thoughts the morning after the wedding. Connor convinces her to give the marriage a genuine effort. Megan has a deep fear of abandonment. She thinks if Connor finally knows the real Megan that he will leave her. Eventually Connor is able to show her through his actions as well as words that he's there to stay.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Love, love love this. Comes in a very nice case. Just as expected, having fun watching episodes over and over again.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Mine stopped working after a few weeks and the support from Google was not good. They had no diagnostic abilities to offer. I had to return the product. Maybe a next generation will be better.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|One of the best shows on TV! The show was a sleeper until around season 3 or 4, that is when more people started to follow it. Now 9 seasons later and I still can't get enough of it!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am so glad I read this trilogy!!! Amazing read!! I'm sure if you're looking at the third book you have figured that out! :)
B00E9E4I8I|5.0|This LP's analog sound is amazingly correct and I very much enjoy  Lisitsas musicality.CD perhaps not sounds like a digital or electronic piano(that can sound very good) but they have a similar weakness.<br />Thanks
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I thought this movie was fantastic! Nonstop action, wiseacre dialogue.  No movie can top Star Trek in my eyes but this movie was definitely watchable.
0307387178|5.0|My gosh, what an excellent book. A passionate story as well as exciting. I was amazed how informative Jon Krakauer was in this book and his theory/discovery through his research is outstanding. I recommend this book to anyone, it is well worth 5 stars.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|I'm a huge Goldie Hawn fan. This is one of my favorite movies of hers. I'm a fan a of dark scary humor. Bruce Willis has always been a star and of course Meryl is awesome as always. A very funny classic for those with a silly sense of humor. Enjoy.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|a quick easy read but packed full of life lessons.  This book should be read by all family members and discussed and a good book for teachers to assign to their students no matter what grade and college students as well.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|I don't have all the beatles albums. But every time I buy one it just makes me like the beatles more! This album is the soundtrack to a movie that the beatles starred in. I love this album so much!! Flying is so cool. I like the beatles because at the time nobody else made music like them. Make that nobody else made music like that in music history. John Lennon said that this was his favorite album because it was weird. It is really odd. I am the walrus, blue jay way, and baby you're a rich man are my favorite tracks. The remaster sounds great on good speakers. Here's a fun fact: At some school kids were analyzing beatles lyrics. The kids said they were confusing. So John Lennon wrote the most confusing song he could and the song was I am the walrus.<br /><br />BYE!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|works great!! my kid loves it!  very high quality!  very good price!  would buy again!  perfect for what I use it for!

The multitude of music options in the application make it useful for every type of mood. I have never been one to sleep  or study with noise, but this is so relaxing that I don’t even notice it in the background.
B008G12ERC|2.0|I really didn't like this album. I got it as gift. The last two song were the worst because of the odd sounds. I was really happy when I got it till I listened to it. I can see why other people like it, but it wasn't my thing.

Both are unexpectedly caught in a romance after meeting via Timberlake's change in employers as an advertising executive.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It was an awesome piece of gadget I love from Google for just USD35. I recommend it. Just try it.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I saw the movie at the theater and wanted to get it on DVD.  The price of the DVD at the first release time was too high.  So I waited.  Then the 3 disk extended collector's edition was released.  I again waited until the price had dropped.  I'm glad I did.  I've enjoyed this movie over and over again.  Now I've just have to wait for the Avatar II movie to come out.  Its all about a waiting game.
B00FY2UJAU|5.0|Paul Walker you are one of a kind.  I purchased this because of you and you alone.  RIP!  God Bless!  I also made a donation to your charity which does outstanding work.  Thank you Universal for providing this purchase to the great organization that Paul was a part of.  I did see this on the big screen and loved it.  However, I probably would have rented it but proud to have bought it.
B00EV4F5TC|5.0|I saw the movie and I am waiting for the DVD to see it again, and again. The direction and storyline were easy to follow.  I love Forest Whitaker!  I think the entire cast was great and I was surprised how much they made me believe I was watching the real people, not actors.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing this game on my Kindle Fire HD. It's fun to play. I love playing cards and this is easier than shuffling real cards.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I am a fan of John Grisham.  The storyline is intense but good and it is easy to follow the characters.  I haven't finished reading the book but I like what I read so far.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to any serious reader. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars. It is the best book I have ever read.
0307352153|2.0|I should have taken a closer look before buying this book. I do have a couple of books at home that deal with all kinds of topics like personality orders and psychological questions, that are very well structured and bring out simple yet good examples. They also have good thoughts on how to deal with situations when being a friend, partner or co-worker.<br /><br />In this book many of the main points get lost in too much not-related information and the focus is on business and career most of the time. I consider myself being an introvert and I am sure that not everybody's goal in life is to become a sales person or being the head of a company. And as said by other people here...it is good that we have both, introvert and extrovert people.<br /><br />For someone who is not really familiar with the introvert/extrovert topic this book does not help grasping easily what it is about. It is nothing &#34;new&#34;, it is not a disease, it is not all black or white. It is &#34;simply&#34; a different way of processing and communication thoughts and feelings - and, of course, there is variety.
B001O1O71C|5.0|So touching, tells the story from a new perspective. Children can understand just how horrible this war was and how innocent people died for no reason. Human life is precious, and needs to be respected.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|This is a great and classic movie that I basically grew up with! See it if you haven't already! It seems like just yesterday that I was bopping around to the songs of John Travolta and Olivia Newton John!
0062082841|5.0|I'm a big fan of del Toro's work. I was super excited to get this book and get insight in his genius work.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great Movie, I would diffidently recommend this movie to anyone. Very family friendly, you want be disappointed in the movie.
B000059TEQ|5.0|I purchased this for a friend and let me tell you, she has not stopped crying. This movie causes one to appreciate the gift of love and how to treasure it while you have the emotion.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I really liked this book. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series now. I could not put it down.
0307236722|4.0|MY DAUGHTER GOT ME THIS COOKBOOK FOR CHRISTMAS, MARTHA HAS QUITE A FEW GREAT TIPS ON WHAT PANS & UTENSILS TO USE  PLUS GREAT RECIPES.  MY DAUGHTER USES HERS CONTINUALLY
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I felt like I was right in there with her and I could definitely relate because of my personal experiences.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Lovely. I listened to the cd 5times back to back the day I received it. I especially love their creative arrangements for Star Wars and Beethoven's Secrets. I had not ever heard a cello used as a percussion instrument before so that was neat also. I purchased the cd after a friend showed me some of their videos on YouTube. Now I can take their music with me in my car too.
B00DXP7L88|4.0|Season 8 lived up to my expectations totally but there were some issues a couple of the DVDs playing in my computer where they would hang up and stop playing for a bit before restarting. In one case I had to actually close my program and then restart it and resume the episode. This is not a problem I have had watching other DVDs using my computer so I have to assume it is these DVDs. Not bad enough to return but bad enough to be annoying.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Very good.  Especially since I like Johnny Depp movies.  The moment I started watching it, it kept my attention.  The moment it was over, was the moment I came on to Amazon to find it and buy it.  If you like Johnny Depp's movies and vampire and other creatures movies then buy this.<br /> I believe you will like it too.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|It was great to pick up with the characters from A Time To Kill. Jake, Harry Rex, Ozzie, Lucien, and Carla are warm, comfortable and pleasingly familiar. It is three years after the case that cemented Jake's reputation as a skilled litigator. While his notoriety is strong, his bank account is weak. Such is the reality of small town lawyering. Then a case falls in his lap involving the will of a gentleman that has taken his own life.<br /><br />We are then treated to a course on wills and estates as only Grisham can do. Nothing is straightforward and a part of The South's ugly past plays an important role. I thoroughly enjoyed the book until it moved into the courtroom. Then it became procedural. Most disappointing was the resolution that watered down the book's opening and premise. Still it entertains and moves at a great clip. Grisham always ensures that justice is done.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best game of the year and all people should have it.  It is so cool I just had to get the app.  From : Caroline Mays
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|I brought the game and it said I didn't have any space to install so I download clean master and I cleared some stuff then it said you need an sd card<br />Pps help
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I love and respect Jane Austen. This is yet another example of a precursor to social media, albeit a much earlier time.  Social connections bringing both joy and pain to those who chose to navigate it either willingly or by necessity. The early chapters started so slowly for me I thought the beginning laborious. Once the characters and plot identified I could not put the book down. After reading so many Jane Austen novels the ending was not a surprise but it did conclude in a way attractive to me and desirable. I enjoyed this book very much.
B0063GORYU|4.0|So much fun. I use it to kill time while getting dialysis. Never bored now. I will tell my friends to get this app.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|My 9 yr old uses this app. It gives him the daily practice he wants. Since he beats mom every time we have ever played, the computer gives him more of a fun challenge;) In settings, you can change levels of difficulty as well as colors/ appearance of the board.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Refreshing to see a strong woman battle though obstacles and a tainted reputation by convincing with wit and ability rather than showing legs.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Worked well got it on times and fair price. Its Amazon... come on... Thank you for sending what was promissed
B00005JPAO|5.0|Helen Mirren did an absolutely beautiful portrayal of Queen Elizabeth. It was so good that I found myself thinking she was the queen. Great acting, great writing.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I use it for my cell and tablet. Come on ... it is from Amazon. By Amazon. It real easy to use
006202406X|1.0|I don't think I've ever been more disgusted with a series' final book. Fraught with countless elements that made me feel hopeless and depressed, 'Allegiant' came nowhere even remotely close to meeting the expectations I unavoidably had after reading 'Divergent.'
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game.... I like how it gives you the option to change your posting preferences for Facebook. You can still get your goals completed without bombarding all your friends on Facebook.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal immediately grabs the reader and thrusts them into a high speed car chase through bomb torn 1944 London. Ian Fleming, agent 17F, has been summoned to intelligence headquarters. But first he must elude two Nazi agents intent upon his demise.<br /><br />Author Damian Stevenson has an eye for detail and the literary skill to transform that detail into a gripping WW2 spy thriller. He has captured the spirit of Ian Fleming's James Bond and transferred it to Bond's creator. From a literary point of view, Stevenson has undertaken a dangerous challenge and pulls it off with Bond like aplomb.<br /><br />Damian Stevenson is a up and coming talented author. I look forward to the next installment of the Ian Fleming Files.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game! It's all addicting but a few minutes ago it Said it was out of sync &amp; kicked me out &amp; it won't let me back in!!!!!! Please fix this dumb glitch asap!!!!!!
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I went to see Blue Sky Riders because of Kenny Loggins, but after what I heard, I came home an instant fan of the Blue Sky Riders and purchased their CD. I was completely and utterly surprised, in all the best ways, when I heard these powerful harmonies and individual voices working on their own contemporary Nashville sound. It's an appropriate album name for these experienced troubadours to feel they are Finally Home in Nashville. I can't wait to see them again and to hear what their next offering will bring.
B006QVRUS2|4.0|There's no plot to find in Carnage. Apart from the catalyst for the meeting of their two sons fighting, there is no reasons why these four different characters stay together in the seemingly real time conversation in an apartment. At times this can feel contrived, as you do wonder why the characters stay so long when the \\"Carnage\\" unfolds in front of our eyes but with believable and great performances from all four actors, you can forgive the constructed script. Strangely, it manages to be both realistic and wholly fake at the same time. Watching people speak in a room for an hour and twenty minutes could have been a boring film but it feels like we, like the characters, are meeting these people for the first time, and we pass the veneer of civility as the film unfolds and we get to know the people as we see them. You like them, you hate them, and you like them again. You find out interests and fears and that bloody mobile phone will annoy you as much as the characters.<br /><br />Funny, realistic and telling, Carnage is an interesting experiment that explores the problems with a purely character-driven film but also does it as best it can. The conversation flows naturally, but you know that it isn't realistic. It's a film you can only watch once. The film is a conversation to the audience, and retreading the same conversation again and again will just, as one of the characters put it, \\"get boring\\".
B002KH4KSY|3.0|Thsi adaptation of the original to a TV movie didn't need to be made.  The Isaac character just wasn't scary enough, and the main couple were kind of annoying with their personal problems.  I don't regret buying it for my collection, but I probably won't watch it again.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|its so cool you get to kill some dangerous animals I've killed a wolverine its like mega ultra super awesome is so cool I recomemd it
B0011HOEY4|5.0|Denzel at his finiest. I loved this movie and my brother and I recite the lines every time we visit. THis movie was epic and I wish that there count have been a sequel.
1592400876|5.0|I'm a stickler for the correct use of the English language--much like Lynne Truss. I've long forgotten all the &#34;rules,&#34; the whys of usage.<br /><br />But I know that the rules have never before been presented in this fashion: This is a good read just for fun!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|When I saw the 3.5 stars for this album, I had to review it.  You need to drop your preconceptions of the man, and pop on some headphones and get yourself in an objective state of mind.  I'm primarily an indie rock fan, but these songs build, grow, and give you the shivers.  This is production at its absolute highest quality.  Sure, the lyrics lack depth, but the power of their composition is stunning.  Highlights include I'm in it, Bound 2, Blood on the leaves, and Hold my liquor.  There is a reason this album is on nearly every respected critics top 10 of 2013.
0439813786|4.0|Whwn I read this book, it was very diffrent from other books and was took my eye. The most surprising thing is that the pages.<br />This book looked so mystical that I first hesitsted to read this book..Howerver the story was far different then its mystical cover . The story started with a boy living in a station, living as a clockkeeper.The only thing he has is a automaton and a notebook (about the automaton) that his father left.The story startes when he is trying to steal a toy, from a toyshop in order to get parts for the automaton.<br />And then he is got by the store keeper, and thats the time where the story becomes interestng. [Hugo] has been a movie and I recommend this to people who wnts to know Hugo
1582701709|5.0|Very inspiring and thought provoking.  I read (and watched the movie) at a very difficult time in my life.  It really helped change my perspective and I'm grateful I read it.  *** Update two years later....  I still practice the principles in this book and the transformation my life has taken is amazing.  I highly recommend not only reading it, but actually practicing it on a daily basis!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|absolutely LOATHED the ending but the rest was so good! There was one point when I just stopped reading it because I was so furious but I eventually finished it. I guess I just like a happy ending! But, that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it! It was one of the most unique books I have ever read.
B00FG8H93W|1.0|Totally rip off if you pay anything more than $36.00 for this set.  As much as your kids may like this for the Holiday, it is a really small set and not worth over $40 bucks!  I bought ours at our mall near by at the Lego store.  Don't get ripped off!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|I did not like this movie.  Had the plot of a primetime episode.  Will and Jaden Smith were the wrong actors for this.  They should've gone with nobodies and it would have at least been palatable.  M. Night Shyamalan strikes again!
0061906220|5.0|The text rolls off the tongue and is fun for youngsters to &#34;read&#34; along. Pete has a good attitude as he deals with problems.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Moving and well crafted. A clever and appealing book. August is a lovely lesson about beauty, character and intelligence. Highly recommended.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Definitely I love Michael Bublé after that disc. Romantic, enthusiastic and so sweet.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|The newest Scarpetta mystery is another excellent book in the series. Dr Scarpetta, Lucy, and Marino are as good as it gets in fiction.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is an awesome application that show u the weather from the main pull down screen!! All around accurate and convenient
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can only play in short waves. Fast paced a lot of fun. Haven't figured out a lot of the secret places yet. I like this one. Its does want you to buy (I will not) but you don't have to and you still advance.

B00GH4R95C|5.0|Who doesn't like this movie. Need to watch it again and pay attention. How real they made this very special character in American folklore. It made me feel when I pass an I hop or Sears. I may catch a glance flying above us. The realism they tried to bring is a SUCCESS!!!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I want to change my background to a photo of mine but cant find out how. The Kindle Fire needs a small in structure book, I do better if I see what to do, not call every time I need help.

B008MM9630|3.0|I like the game but you have to collect alot of jewels before you can purchase alot of items. I can't afford to purchase these jems , I would hope that the creators can make it more assessable to obtain jewels without purchase.Or unfortunately eventually I'll have to stop playing and delete the game.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|So, huge spoiler alert.  Whoop, whoop, whoop!  Whoop, whoop, whoop! Spoiler alert!  You know, I read this book because I read &#34;The Book Thief&#34; first.  Did I like &#34;The Book Thief&#34;?  Yeah, I did.  Did I like this book better?  Oh, yeah.  Much better.  Why did I like this book better?  You know, I wouldn't have been able to tell you unless you've read both books.  Having read &#34;The Book Thief&#34;, do I want to see the movie?  Well, kinda--only to see how the star-studded cast can bring the beautifully written story to screen.  When I read that the movie doesn't address the two books that Max writes for Liesel, the major turning, revolving, focusing points of the novel, I immediately swore off seeing the movie.  Then I read that Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson were casted ... and so, am in conflict.<br /><br />I appreciate a writer who leaves much of the ending of a story to my mind, so that I can create and develop the pictures and plots in my mind.  In &#34;The Book Thief&#34;, we have Death playing a speaking role--almost to the point of where I felt, as a reader, that I was beaten over the head with the fact that Death was in the forefront and taking an active role.  Yes, yes, Death.  Okay, gotcha, let's move along.  I was also confounded, or conflicted, when there were these sections of airy prose--not prose, yeah prose--thrown into the mix BIG and BOLD and COMMANDING.  I didn't know the source.  Maybe I was just stupid, or had too much too drink.  It wasn't revealed until whatever chapter that it was our Ms. Liesel who was writing these BIG and BOLD and COMMANDING passages.  Wow, when I understood this--like I said, I might have been behind all cheering on Death for narrating  and cleverly leading us down a path where Ms. Liesel would taking the jumping off point.  Whew!  Boy, howdy.  When I had that realization, the novel completely opened up and I read it again from the beginning so I could absorb, and intrinsically know, breathe even, the essence of Ms. Liesel.  Then the novel was, holy cow, for teens?  Pfft.  For everyone.  Period.<br /><br />Okay, so where was I?  Oh, yeah, this book.  I think when one reads that the English version of this novel is titled &#34;I Am the Messenger&#34; but in other languages the novel is titled &#34;The Message&#34;.  I think that if you view the novel through the looking-glass of the novel as &#34;The Message&#34; rather than &#34;I Am the Messenger&#34; I might persuade you to see/read the novel my way.  In this novel, the protagonist--Christ on a cracker.  Sorry, let me just be me.<br /><br />In this novel, our wanna-be hero, Ed, is living a bland and bleak life:  SSDD, in other words, and I apologize I offend with my language:  Same Shit, Different Day.  He isn't living live, he is simply existing--that is, until he finds himself as a potential hostage in a bank robbery and steps outside *cringes from the overused reference* his box and well, saves the day.  He then is the recipient of a playing card with a task.  Okay, folk.  So those of you who were &#34;surprised&#34; by the ending?  Who in the heck did you think were sending the cards?  To make a long story short, Ed learns it's the little things, sometimes the odd things, the different ways of connecting and validating folk for who they are in their world and sorting through the flotsam and jetsam of &#34;Hi, how are you?&#34; and &#34;Nice day, isn't it?&#34;.  In other words he takes a stand and does that which he believes is right for him and his heart; just right for who-he-is-right-now-and-crap-to-all-the-rest.<br /><br />So then, to the ending that a bunch o' folk didn't like, but I did.  Okay, so who is a big fan of SF out there, anybody?  Christ, doesn't anyone &#34;do&#34; metaphors anymore, or is it just me?  Ed is visited by this little guy; a youngin' whom I see as, seasonally appropriate and for lack of a better term, the ghost of Christmas past.  The little guy ain't Ed, but he's an apparition ofa kinda' Ed, of a youngish' Ed, or *gasp* could it be the devil appearing in a form that is likable and unoffensive to our *snicker* Mr. Ed reminding him of the difference of who he was then and who is is now?  I have a quote, but can't reach it as my Kindle is in the other room, and I have a Chocolate Labrador named Luna lying on my feet impeding my progress whilst begging for treats.<br /><br />I'm paraphrasing thanks to Luna:  the little guy holds a mirror up to Ed and asks him if he is &#34;looking at a dead man now?&#34;  And Ed, in a whisper, in a flood, sees all &#34;those places and people again&#34; (my husband called Luna out for treats so I was able to rescue my Kindle).<br /><br />Not to be a smart-ass, because, well, I am one, who can't see from the obvious writing and the mysterious little guy holding a mirror up to our protagonist asking him to reflect upon his life, can't see the obvious that the little guy is and/or could be Mephistopheles.  Not that Ed every actively and/or overtly wished for a change of life through the devil; I think it was understated and pretty darn clear through the writing.  Oh, that and I totally loved when Ed told off his mom and said something like, &#34;It doesn't matter who I am there, it matter who I am and the changes that I make here.&#34;  Again, paraphrasing as Luna has once again settled on my feet and my Kindle is far, far away.<br /><br />Again, I could be wrong.  Call me odd, loved the book, the ending, and must give props to the writer for following a life-long dream of published author.a kinda' Ed, of a youngish' Ed, or *gasp* could it be the devil appearing in a form that is likable and unoffensive to our *snicker* Mr. Ed reminding him of the difference of who he was then and who is is now?

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These books are a good read. Mockingjay completed the story perfectly. Great character development. You can feel yourself in the story several times along the way.
B008NW67E0|5.0|It was everything I wanted and more I am very happy with my purchase and looking forward to shopping more in the future
B00095NX9G|5.0|I haven't even worked through all of both disks yet, but so far I love this.  The yoga portion is paced very well and is a great workout/preparation without being too over the top.  I found it hard to keep up with the drills on disk one (I am in intermediate level dancer), however I think once I've done them a few times it will get much easier.  I love the tone of the disks, which is comfortable, and not overly boucy and cheesy.  Great stuff!

B00GIXWXEO|5.0|I freakin love this movie. I watched it in theaters and then watched it through amazon with my boyfriend. I would watch it again and again. Also Amazon is great for watching movies. While being deployed overseas in the military I cannot use many sites like Netflix because they are not available in some other countries.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's very good. I could not put it down except she doesn't really describe the characters very well. She also can't describe a place. I watched the movie and all but still.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|love this movie and came really fast. I had lost my original and I had to buy it again, it was just that funny
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very enjoyable read!  I will look for more from this Australian author.  The development of the three main characters is masterful and will leave you caring about each one.  Once the secret is revealed, you'll wonder what you would do in such a situation as the characters wrestle with the devastating consequences.  I especially loved the epilogue.  This book was a delicious vacation read and well worth the modest price on Kindle.
B002413TY2|4.0|Great movie. Consistently great entertainment. Classic Jason Statham, he plays the same character in pretty much every movie I've seen him in but it's always entertaining.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Good story, but pretty melodramatic.  I won't go into detail as others already have.  The writing style wasn't to my liking.  There was too much reiteration which made the story drag.  This was an ok vacation read, but not a favorite.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is awesome! Easy to get addicted to this when you start watching! I can't wait for Season 4!
B000QQH4YS|5.0|I researched the items before buying them and I was not disappointed with my choice, the items covered my expectations.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|DH and I really enjoyed this movie.  I wouldn't hesitate to allow my 10 year old grandson, with a little explanation, to see it, but it is also extremely entertaining for Grams and Gramps.  All the main actors are exceptional in this comedy/action movie.  I'd gladly see it again whenever we want to see a light hearted movie with a lot of &#34;fire power.&#34;<br /><br />BTW,  it was the first one we saw using Roku which I really think is a great idea.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This was an exciting book from the beginning to the end.  No wimpy female but one of courage and strength.  Great reading.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|love all the songs. if you like 80's pop, these three sisters do a pretty good job at modernizing that era and making it their own if i do say so myself. their music is a great alternative to all the loud stuff we hear these days. i pretty much let the album play on shuffle without skipping one track.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|An amazing story, and an amazing artist. Love his music and hope he gets his royalties. Watch the documentary, then listen to the CD.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell continues his insightful writing style pulling examples from widely different contexts to support his thesis.  Like his other books, a very good read.

B003G4W49C|2.0|I did not care for this book as much as others I have read lately. Frankly I am surprised that I finished it. It was hard to follow at times and took a while to understand where it was headed. The last few chapters redeemed it a little. Overall it has a depressing feel to it and it hardly kept my interest.
B0081SRJSY|1.0|I don't see what the point is to this. Doesn't seem to matter where the &quot;opponents&quot; place tiles, they get points, while after several moves my points go away, and get no more moves, while the two computer opponents play themselves and make cute comments to each other. Doesn't matter where the computer moves, or what tiles it places, it scores points. This is a classic game?? Not.  pos
B0042MEQVG|1.0|I bought this for my wife and it's like daggers in my skull every time she watches it. I die a little inside every time that idiot Kristen Stewart starts talking... A pox on Stephenie Meyer's for what she has cursed us with.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is great for saving things for future use. For crafts, gifts to make, recipes and I began using it for teaching lessons to save in one convenient place. I Love not having to stress about using too much space on my tablet or computer and still be able to save a ton of stuff I can use later. And ideas that are shared are also great. I also love being able to save from Internet pages with pictures as a reminder of what things look like and having access to order what I like from websites..
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Google Chromecast HDMI streaming media player was reasonably priced, simple to hook up, easy to activate.<br /><br />It is a welcome addition to our household media devices. It is important to ensure that the WiFi signal is strong to avoid connection issues.<br /><br />I'm sure that the number of supported media services will increase in the future making this little device even more popular<br /><br />Very satisfied!
0399160450|4.0|Another good Tom Clancy book. Must buy for all Clancy fans. Love his Jack Ryan books. This one focuses more on Jack Junior but is still a great read.
B00FOWX6NM|4.0|Exactly as represented at a great price...Great moccachino color. Unfortunately without the solution and lint free lens cloths other screen protectors provide my install went awry and could not be completed.
B0032UYFA6|4.0|Watched one of these shows and got hooked and had to buy all the past seasons.  Great and iconic show that was well worth the purchase price.
B001HC8516|4.0|The hardest thing to face is that the cute guy you are dating but who won't commit it being your boyfriend, but in all other ways is sweet and kind is just not that into you. Yeah it ain't easy. And when I figure out how to do it, I will let you know. In the mean time buy the book and skip the movie.

0375842209|5.0|Originally posted on The Canon! {[...]<br /><br />All I can say is...wow.<br /><br />I was apprehensive about reading this book because it sounded too good to be true. There were so many awestruck reviews and cult followers that it almost put me off from reading it. I am so glad I did.<br /><br />Liesel's character immediately grabbed my attention and sympathy. I can't imagine how hard it would be to experience what she does in only the first few pages. I have to admit, I considered turning back after what happened to her on the train, but if she could get through it, so could I.<br /><br />Her character embodies the best and worst of this war. She fascinated me because she was at once completely safe and yet forever in danger, a class that might have contained more people through the history of World War II than I know. I held my breath in fear for her and applauded her efforts to steal books, her small vice in the face of such evil. Liesel has this vibrance about her that brings out the light even in the dark times she lived in. I can't explain exactly why she was so entrancing without calling up plot points that could be spoilers. If you've read The Book Thief, you know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />Liesel has that freedom in life that makes her an excellent secondary narrator - in fact, this is the only book I'm aware of that has such a narration. At first, I found it a little jarring, but once I got used to the idea that her narration was being told from someone else's point-of-view, it clicked. Liesel is in the position to describe what was going on in the heart of Germany during the buildup and eventual outbreak of World War II. Her childlike innocence and adult awareness brings a slightly fragile quality to her narration of these times that would make the most stalwart reader tremble with emotion.<br /><br />The credit, in my mind, of this novel goes to the primary narrator, one that doesn't fully introduce himself until a few pages into the novel. The unique choice to choose Death as the narrator made this book. It's not often I come across an all-knowing narrator that doesn't strike me as arrogant. Death, more often than not, appealed to me, and I pitied him occasionally for the awful task he had to do.  It was never gruesome, and I appreciate that. He has a quiet, almost mournful, quality to his narration, one that really lends to the all-knowing character relating a story about a young girl who loved books. I never pictured Death as a sympathetic character, but then again, this book was nothing like what I expected.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: The Book Thief is an extraordinary novel, one that accurately captures all the emotions of this horrible time in our history. I am fascinated by this novel, and it has stayed in my mind ever since I've put it down.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love being able to set multiple alarms in the morning simply because I tend to not wake up at the first one. I paired it with the InkPad Notepad (for notes) so I can alarm myself to see the notes to make sure I do what I typed out.
B0055OMBIU|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my teen daughter for xmas, as she has a Paris themed room. So of course I have not opened the box however it does look super super cool and even better in person. She is going to love it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I hadn't read a Stephen King book in many years, though about 15 years ago, his books were pretty much all I read. This book reminded me of why I was so passionate before. I was almost immediately wrapped up in the story, invested in the all-too-real characters and had to consciously relax the muscles in my neck on several occasions as the tension built. Such an involved read!
080214473X|5.0|This book in my opinion was really good.  I thought it had very important facts that we could use in everyday society.  I also thought it was well written and had well well written transitions.  I liked how the book focused on a soldiers bias, so the reader could understand explicitly what happened during the battle.  Also how it affected the soldiers life and American society.  I would recommend this book to anybody who likes the concept of war.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This remains my favorite show ever!  It never fails to shock and amaze me with the storylines and relationships that develop in this new world the group is left with.  So many Zombie stories are focused on the Zombies.  This is all about how they deal with life after.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I like it<br />It is good it's funny I have never read it before I love it I can't wait
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This movie is great! My little boy loves it! If your munchkin likes trains this  movie is top notch! I recommend this movie to all young and old!!!!

B00GPWEPZ8|5.0|Doesn't Tom Hanks ever just sit down and relax? After the grueling \\"Captain Phillips,\\" what does he do for an encore? He gives us Walt Disney (with a regulation mustache) during the time he clashes with P.L. Travers, the feisty woman who wrote \\"Mary Poppins.\\" (I never heard about that, did you? Evidently this battle was waged over a 20-year period, as their respective fortunes waxed and waned.)<br /><br />The doughty author is an unbending, sharp-tongued shrew who flings insults with arrogant abandon but expects to be treated with deference and respect. \\"I am Mrs. Travers, NOT Pamela!\\" She intimidates everyone she encounters, ignores contracts and marches out of meetings without compunction. The pears in her complimentary fruit basket at the Beverly Hills hotel are lobbed off the balcony. Her outrageous demands are legendary: \\"There will be no RED in this film!\\"<br /><br />We follow:<br />  * Tom Hanks (\\"Cloud Atlas\\") as Walt Disney, beset by a cantankerous dame who will not trust him to do justice to her beloved character. It takes his insight and shared memories of mutually unlovable fathers that allows him to finally make a tiny dent in her armor.<br />  * Emma Thompson (\\"Nanny McPhee\\") is P.L. Travers who swears she will make sure her creation is treated with respect. To her, Disney is the personification of a Hollywood machine that will maul her magical nanny beyond recognition. (He first proposed an animated version.)<br />  * Annie Rose Buckley (\\"Home and Away\\") is Ginty, the name her doting father called our author when she was a child in Australia. We see numerous flashbacks that illustrate her hardscrabble childhood.<br />  * Colin Farrell (\\"Dead Man Down\\") is Travers Goff, her beloved banker father who colors her childhood with his affection and his drunkenness. Farrell continues to dazzle me with his range and skill! He even makes his drunken character lovable.<br />  * Ruth Wilson (\\"Luther\\") is Margaret, our author's long-suffering mother, living at thelonely end of the railroad line in Australia.<br />  * Rachel Griffiths (\\"Brothers & Sisters\\") is Aunt Ellie, umbrella and bottomless carpetbag in hand, come to that miserable house to help the struggling family. The moment we see her rigid silhouette at the front door, we KNOW who inspired Mary Poppins!<br />  * Paul Giamatti (\\"Romeo and Juliet\\") is Ralph, the first American to face Travers' withering scorn; he is her limo driver. She isn't impressed by California; when she sniffs the air, he tells her she is smelling jasmine, she thinks it \\"smells of sweat!\\"<br /><br />\\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" is hidden from Mrs. Travers because she won't tolerate nonsense. Disney's talented but thoroughly cowed songwriters (played by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) are out-witted, out-foxed and out-maneuvered by this wily, determined, and exasperating woman.<br /><br />The screening audience often laughed at her acerbic (PG-13) wit. Me, not so much; I missed a lot because I couldn't hear it. I found myself longing for closed captions; I know I'll love my DVD when it becomes available on Amazon.<br /><br />Oh! Mr. Banks is the children's father in \\"Mary Poppins.\\" He's a banker. Did you remember that?
0761172726|5.0|This calendar is wonderful. We get one every year even though there is overlap. I can see, at a glance, exactly what's going on with each of my family members. Plus, the stickers are amusing for my kiddo.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Tried a &#34;universal&#34; mini USB that said that would work on the Kindle Fire but the little bumps on the plug do not match the original. I ordered 4 of them (my wife and I both have Kindle Fires) so that we can plug them in the den and in our front room when we have a morning cup of coffee.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Another page turner. Keeps ur interest. Can't wait to start next book in series. Still waiting for next movie in P.J. series.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great game like the graphics. Does the characters justice and I like the speed of the game. Could use more. Credits to get started though.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This novel educated me about the &#34;great experiment&#34; to place orphans with families who wanted to adopt a child - usually farm families out West where work was hard and they needed help.  Although touted as better than the workhouses of Britain, a lot went wrong with this experiment that &#34;meant well&#34; with regard to these children with no means.  Gets one thinking about how we treat the poor.
B008469DGY|4.0|Kept us entertained on a long flight and it is like real golf.  It is hard, frustrating and it is like my real scores
0670026603|5.0|Just about perfect. Not the usual &#34;love story&#34;, more a coming-of-age of a young woman who finds herself in the strangest of ways.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|It sucks .Her last concert sucked .I guess she is ready to get out of the music business .I have seen her in person two times .The first concert was great and the second was horrible .John Postiglione
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to use - syncs with my computer - helps me stay organized!  I love being able to keep my documents up to date between devices!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game I originally downloaded it because my daughter loves horses but I play it more than her! Fun for all
014241543X|3.0|If I Stay is a contemporary story that straddles the line between YA and literature. It's a tearjerker, first and foremost, that occasionally dips into the maudlin. But it's also the (non-linear) story of a life, or really just two or three years of a life. It's a romance, at its soul, that focuses on the power of love as opposed to the journey of finding it.<br /><br />I'm keeping this review simple because the book itself was pretty simple. Mia's decision is one I think most of us have considered, and her reasons for staying or going are both compelling and earnest. It's an emotional and relatively static read, but if you like contemporary stories based entirely in memory, you'll probably enjoy it.
B00DXLO0D6|5.0|I'm a big fan of this television show and I had been wanting the complete series for years - however, the price tag always deterred me from purchasing. When I happened across this deal I immediately pre-ordered it. I didn't care if there wasn't a bottle or a story about the making of the show inside - all I wanted was the DVDs and that is what I got for only $32. It arrived about 5 days after the available date and I was charged accordingly. Needless to say, I have been very pleased with this collection. It is in a simple box with a simple container for the DVDs - no flipping of pages to get your DVDs as they are all in one plastic container, safe and sound. I love this show, and am so happy it was made available in its entirety for a small price compared to the more flashy sets. Thank you Amazon!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game if you like building cities. I would recommend this game... it's a really good free app.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was not expecting that ending which is a good thing. Another great addition to the series. Now on to the next one...
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I am a trackball user for my computer but I needed high DPI for my Xbox 360. (I am a pc gamer so I can't use a Xbox 360 controller so I use a keyboard and mouse) This mouse amazed me so much that I am probably going to replace my trackball of over 20 years with a mouse. It is very responsive, glides like on ice, adjust the weight to your liking, buttons are easy to reach and the programmability is amazing! I have contacted support a couple of times 1 for information and the other for a macro software update recommendation. They were both courteous, friendly, prompt, and very informative! You can't go wrong with this product!
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Definitely I love this addictive game. I really recommend this game for all the good pool players. Welcome to play with me whenever you want.
B0013UZHS6|4.0|There are 100 pieces..  I was unsure how many when I ordered  these for  a Christmas present for my son. He has so many legos but no windows or doors.  This is a great addition to his lego collection.  Excited to be able to build houses with him.
0385333846|1.0|This book was very tedious.  Highly over rated.  Would not recommend to anyone.  It made no sense to me at all.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like this game but reasons for 3 stars are:  too short of time to clear candy and then after 3 or 4 plays you ahve to wait 15 or 30 mins to play again.  What kind of game is that.  Then when you get to a certain point, they want you to buy the next levels.  I have a bunch of other games on my Kindle Fire that don't do that.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 year old is learning to trace letters what could be better!  He loves trains so it's fun for him and he is learning

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Thanks the movie was in great shape and I enjoyed it one night when there was nothing else to watch with a big bowl of pop corn !!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Really good but thought--over all--1st book was the best I read of the 3.  Will look forward to the movie adaptation next year(??)
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Very good program.  So many twists.  It is worth watching.  Well written and acted.  The scenery is beautiful too.  Hard to pick who to cheer for some of the time.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this so that I could stream from my laptop, or my Mac or my iPad. After 4 weeks of trying, I'm giving up. It's going in the trash. It doesn't connect. Useless.
B005CAPS0K|2.0|IMHO an okay movie, which my wife and I really didn't like. It was imaginative to a degree and a little scary. However it was disappointing in that the acting/directing/screenwriting was not good. Where do I begin? First this was not based on any kind of real story or events (not that that is essential to a good film but it might have lent more depth and reality to a poor script), which to me would have made it more interesting. Second, some of the actors (the high tech paranormal investigators and their psychic colleague ) act as though this is routine which doesn't seem to be realistic. Do they go through this every week? And,  after all, many real people would have had many troubles after witnessing such events most especially fear and terror, stress and possible psychological problems. But even more objectionable is this psychic who seems to know it all. I have studied real life possessions in Malachi Martin's(former Jesuit exorcist at the Vatican) book Hostage to the Devil . This movie seems to be completely ignorant of demonic possession and exorcism. One priest makes one entrance in the story and then is shown the door.Then the battle against the demons takes place with high tech and a &#34;great&#34; psychic. Not once is the word 'God' mentioned. All real exorcisms have priests, rabbis, ministers casting demons out in the name of God/Jesus. Here we have confident , arrogant people with no clue battling against Demons/Satan. Religion is never really mentioned. There seems to be a strong tendency to avoid any mention of spirituality, faith, prayer, religion in the battle against evil.Seems ridiculous that the traditional weapons against evil have been expunged and replaced with pride and ego. It is really sad in our modern secular society to see how bigoted film makers are in being close minded to spirituality and religion. These film makers should have studied the classic movie &#34;The Exorcist&#34; and/or done some research into real life accounts. Sometimes the reality is much scarier.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I didn't like this album the first time I listened to it. Upon more listenings I realized it was an awesome album. I would say it is equal to toxicity.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book and the best book<br /> of the hunger games series I really enjoyed reading this book
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A beautifully written book about the amazing journey of Jobs. I have developed a fascination for his genius and learned A LOT. Highly recomended.
140120841X|5.0|The book was just simply Amazing, the graphics were right on the money and the whole storyline was just so real. I don't regret buying this book not for a second.
B00GII9UCW|3.0|The collection is interesting, but lacks excitement.  I love the Everly Brothers' catalogue, but I think some selections with a little more &#34;pace&#34; would be great.  Billie Joe and Norah have good chemistry and the players are good, but the piece, as a whole, lacks something and serves best as background music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicting! Trouble with some levels but I love the challenge! Refuse to buy any powerups though. Don't have the extra cash right now!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast is an excellent replacement for a Roku or something similar as long as you only use the main apps such as Netflix and Hulu.  Anything made by Google seems to work so well and efficiently and the chromecast is a great example of this!  It is super easy to setup and works just as expected.  Can't wait for more apps to become available.
B008200LHW|5.0|Product appears to be a good quality product that is well made.  I would recommend this product to others who have need for this type of equipment.
B0087GF8ZG|2.0|I used it in a broom closet, that seldom gets used. Consumed batteries in a matter of days. After throwing away three sets of 4 AA batteries in less than a month decided to ditch the light. Tried other battery-operated LED lights for the same purpose - neither of them is any better.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun addicting game, have been playing for a week now and I can't put it down. Would recommend getting this game.
B004BSFC46|5.0|I bought these as a gift and they were very happy with them.  I was told they keep her entertained for quite a while, they are light weight and easy to put on her tiny wrists!  Great product.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|Not really a great read.  I was disappointed in some of the subjects Pete chose to cover and some that he didn't.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|Tedious. Boring. Could have been depressing but I refused to let it.<br />I kept thinking that GC went to a few wonderful places in Europe and thought how cool it would be to make a movie here.<br />So he scrounged around, rounded up a story and some gorgeous women and went at it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Super fun to play. Using it on the tablet is intuitive, and the number of words you can play is impressive.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|I was kind of disgusted that they were brothers but then I understood why they fall in love. Is cute
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have previously owned a pair like this and was heartbroken when they broke. I was so excited to find this again. I use these to work out with as well as just to listen to music around the house. What I love about these headphones is the fact that they stay in my ears (unlike the buds that come with apple products) but doesn't completely stick in my ears (like ear plugs). I can't have the ones that are similar to ear plugs simply because I get swimmers ear wearing them. I find the quality of the sound to be great, they are comfortable, portable, and easy to clean.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it. I use it daily for my personal Avon business. It handier than one that gets lost in my Mary popping purse!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the challenge of some of the levels on this game, but without patience and help from friends it does cost money to move forward! I have reached level 140 without spending a dime, but I hate games that claim they are free when they simply aren't!!!
B004J64QR4|5.0|It is wonderful!! I have watched it several times and it gets better and better each time!!  I have seen the play and the movie so I was able to understand every scene, so that is why I love it so much.  The singing is out of this world wonderful!!!
B000059POY|5.0|I remember seeing this in the theater when it first came out. Although it isn't as good a movie as I remembered it to be, the music is still great. It is also fun to see so many stars in this spoof of society in the late 60's.
B000MXFPH8|5.0|Unlike other two reviewer, I was able to use this takoyaki pan with no problem. My takoyaki pan cooked yakoyaki<br />beautifully on first try. I even didn't use convertor like other reviewer mentioned. I have several friends who owns these but they don't have problems either.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't see this series when it first aired, but thanks to the SYFI channel I have become a big fan. Love watching this over and over. The DVDs are of the highest quality.
0439023513|5.0|Brilliant, I can hardly wait to see what they will do for the movie but I will be sad to see it end.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Big fan and this answers many of the questions left when the series was cancelled. Quality of this disc is excellent.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Ever board play Dragon vale it will be fun play for 10 mins if you like play it more if not tell somebody else
147897978X|5.0|I loved it . I reccomed I highly recommend it to all.  Very interesting.  About Malala,s life before and after, up to now.<br />I bought the CD's to listen to while I am driving.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So addictive! Love it and love having new levels added constantly! Very challenging and love the thrill of being challenged while having fun
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story that I couldn't put down. Once i finished this one I had to read the other two books in the series.
B00009P1O2|5.0|An awesome concert to watch. The band did a really good job with this one. Highly recommend this one to watch.
B00EXVZW6E|1.0|This puzzle game is not designed very well.  It is too hard to find an object because the objects to look for do not show up well.  Can't play if you don't know what you are looking for.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This is an absolutely brilliant album!  On first listen the music and lyrics draw you in to a fun and serious ride of emotion, humor and tie'ins to some awesome tracks by other artists.  I absolutely love it.  It's amazing how he ties his new lyrics with lyrics of old to create a totally new sound that still takes you back to earlier Eminem.  Great melodies, awesome flow, intense lyrics and beautiful guests lyrics (ie. Sia, Skylar, Rhianna, etc.).  If this becomes Em's last album, he goes out with a bang!  I hope that it's not his last.  This guy is the epitome of rap.  He's a lyrical genius.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Funny ass hell crazy game.  Have to be quick, fast and precise; yes all three.  Lots of fun.  Did I mention quick?
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|Really good writing and even better acting. It was just a little too drawn out and grim for my taste.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Awesome movie!  Except for the annoying over use of the camera flares....sorry it just looks like bad filming decision to me!!  Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars from me, but I am reducing it to 4 for the annoying shots!!  I like the multiple format package, so that I can watch it however I need too! :)
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|I think I'll reserve my five star rating for the Bible just because of the spiritual significant of it but, as far as an earthly constrained<br />author goes Grisham is as good as it gets. Sycamore Row rates right up there among his best works. I loved the repeated<br />character connections to one of my all time favorites 'A Time To Kill'. This book was very hard to put down. As a matter of fact, I got a little testy on the occasions when I had to.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Limited Apps to use, cannot use Chrome browser on the tablet to tv, but it is wonderful when use Youtube, Netflix and Google.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|it is the first of Matrix movies. what else to say? by know it would be hard to find someone needing to read these reviews.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|TOO WONDERFUL FOR WORDS. Sweet and painful. FUNNY and sad. Will stay with me a long time I am sure.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|So people are saying that's it's a rip off of minecraft. Really how do you see it in this.If it's like minecraft then why is it better? This game has better controls and is a role-play game. Minecraft has 2 lame bosses and terraria has over 20 (on pc) this is cheaper then minecraft so buy the cheaper better game instead. And their is no hardmode for this yet that will take a while
0930289234|5.0|This is the best graphic novel out there. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons did a great job in capturing a very interesting alternative 1985. I've become very attached to this GN for some reason, I'm no sure if it's the story, the characters, the art or something else. So far I've read it over 5 times and I don't get bored of it.<br /><br />As an avid reader, nonconformist of what life ha to offer me, and daydreamer, I've seeked shelter in many books and graphic novels; all of which eventually get old, yet every time I read Watchmen I find something new in the panels of this perfect getaway from daily chaos.<br /><br />Watchmen will forever be my favorite.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is simple in concept yet challenging and engaging. It is visually stimulating and keeps me coming back for more.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|This is the best shooting application I've seen in a while now. The game is addictive and must be played with the charging cable on,you don't want to stop to charge your kindle.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoy reading trashy books and this one fit right in! Towards the end, some of the sex was more then necessary but I actually enjoyed the story line and thought all the books were good. Yes it's not a high quality, super wordy series, but I wasn't looking for that. I don't care how many times a word is re-used or how lacking in content the books had. I wanted something for entertainment and that allowed me to follow along, put the book down then pick it up and jump back in!
1580086810|5.0|I opened the box, picked up the book, started reading it, and read the whole thing standing up.  I was so fascinated I didn't even want to take the time to go sit down.  I can't wait to read it again.  I bought it to show my students since we've been talking about how people live differently around the world.
0345803485|5.0|This book got me hooked right away. Such a good read, I finished it within three days. I could not put the book down.
B000T433CO|5.0|My husband and I have watched this movie several times!  We have 4 cancers between us in the last 7 years, and when we want to just relax and feel good about being alive, we watch this movie.  It didn't get very good reviews when it came out, but those reviewers obviously don't know much about the bumps in life because this is a great Feel-Good movie!  We have gotten many people to watch it, and everyone has enjoyed it.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Love it.  I attach to my brand new Dell Venue 8 via a microUSB adapter and a Targus dock with a USB Keyboard and Mouse attached to a 27&#34; display, add to that a 1TB external harddrive and I have a full desktop system, unplug 1 cable and I have my very portable 8&#34; tablet for on the run. All running Windows 8.1.  Very nice.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|I like her CD, I am a Spears fan. Not a fan of her explicit music, but nonetheless, it is a part of her style. I liked this Cd. No issues here.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun game, simple graphics, could use more instructions about how to find and/or complete different parts of the game or where areas are located.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|What a unique and enjoyable story.  There is something for everyone in the series and I can honestly say it's one of my top 5 ever.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I love this CD because its one that you can leave in your car cd player because every song on it is good. I have a 6-disk changer and I just leave both disks in the player. Great CD!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|It is very useful . I think better than lots of expensive cases. it is very simple. I like it. The screen protector is not that good.
1401938906|2.0|The experiments were pretty much a flop. Maybe because I've been told (in all the books I've read) that the universe will give you what you want at its own pace. You can't force things to happen exactly when you want, but you can draw things into existence. Funny though, the experiment (in this book) that has you ask to see how many beige cars and butterflies you could draw into your day was interesting. I wished for Ferrari red cars and butterflies and got a company logo online I noticed that was a Ferrari red butterfly symbol.
0066620996|5.0|Great approach to this topic.  Unbiased research and then drawing conclusions, rather than having an opinion and finding facts to support it.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Great book. I've only read the first two in the series but I plan on finishing the rest of it soon.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I don't know why but the game won't open or start. I was playing it this morning but now it won't open. It says connecting to the server then it closes. I am so sad now that it won't work! PLEASE HELP! Thank you!
B000I9YWDO|5.0|classic hilarious movie<br />lots of great lines - some really great actors as well - all in the infancy of their careers-<br /><br />this was just the basic dvd without extras or  anything but if you just want to see the film - then this is the right pick!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I know this was meant to be for young adults, but I found this book hard to put down and have alresdy ordered the next two books and I'mm 78 yrs young. I hope to see the movies also.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Hugh Jackman at his best -<br />great story on where Wolverine came/comes from and where he is going next (into the next 3 Xmen movies!)<br /><br />this is by far my favorite in the series<br /><br />if you are buying this for younger fans... be cautious... parental supervision advised as there are some very scary moments and characters not to mention a lot of killing....
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is one of my favorite authors and this was not disappointing, it grasp you from beginning to end.  He never disappoints me.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Loved this book!  Had heard of it, but kind of put off reading it, thought it might be a bit dull.  It was a wonderful story and quick read.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|I thought it was a good book, but there was a lot of information that basically tells you to work hard and you'll be successful....Duh
B001O8C5EQ|5.0|ONE OF MY NEW FAVS !!! This band really has their chops down . all around excellent album .get it !
B003K16P3M|3.0|Good story, good characters,but a bit tame and not a great deal of struggle or challenges for the main character to overcome.  While Katsa was obviously experiencing a change in self identity and purpose, the catalyst for said change didn't feel that hard to the reader.<br /><br />For a story centered around a woman with essentially unlimited fighting ability, there was far to little of it.  The climax was abrupt and left me wanting more.
B000ID37RM|3.0|I would like to say that the whole family loved it, because I think it's one of the best books of all time, but unfortunately, the movie was too dated to keep most people's attention.
B0022Y570K|5.0|Voice, lyrics, music, an intoxicating combination! Completely addicted. consistently great music without being repetitive. A welcome fresh new sound. Wish I would have found them a lot sooner, been searching forever for something this obsessively great!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Wow - we don't really realize what these heroes go through to protect us - this is incredible and unforgettable.
0670451495|5.0|I have given this book to so many children.  It is a must read for children living in or near or visiting Boston
B005NFJAXU|5.0|I love this show since first air and we never stop watching the show, awesome show! I recommend season 1-6!
B00425S1H8|1.0|Check the attachment hardware. It's backward for most female pin receivers.  I had to perform a modification with my plyers.  Don't purchase.<br /><br />Review Update: Plugable Technologies the manufacturer responded to my email.  They are a very service oriented and responsive company I would recommend.  The issue with the device remains, but if you have male threads on your RS 232 port then this device might work. My device had standard female threads and therefore the device did not work without my garage modification.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's great but needs a few more tweaks (like being able to play amazon video). Hopefully google keeps improving it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The ending was predictable and anticlimactic, but still a really interesting read.  Always a little sad when his traditional horror elements are missing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the computer version and this is awesome as well!<br />Amazing can't wait for the update!!!<br />Get this game
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was quite intriguing, starting off with a village in Afghanastan and following the families through the years into current times.  The main characters, a brother and sister, were just amazing to follow.  The story gets off to a odd start, but quickly draws one in and keeps them there until the end.
B00008FN14|5.0|Record was in excellent condition.  I wish it included a few more songs from the movie, but other than that, it is an awesome album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The story itself is good. If you can get around the writing, it's worth the read. I'm looking forward to reading the last book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Loved the story.  Wish it had a different ending, but other than no complaints at all.  Gillian Flynn is a brilliant writer. After reading this, I read 'Dark Places' and 'Sharp Objects'.  Though they will make you feel like leaving the light on at night, you will truly be hooked!  The characters feel real, endearingly flawed and completely UNpredictable.  I am very much looking forward to Ms. Flynn's future work.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Very addictive.  Far  too time consuming..best to not start playing for any length of time if you're employed ..The end..
B00594XOZU|2.0|I've had kik for a long time now. I always used it. Then one day I tried to log in. It said I failed and must try again later. I kept trying and to this day it still doesn't work .
B005PK553C|5.0|Gripping, original storytelling and excellent acting.  My wife and I stumbled on this series and now we are watching all of them.
6305882592|5.0|My friend introduced me to this zaney movie last year. If you like wierd, you'll love this. Very strange, but fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like a good book can not seem to put it down was up all night  didn't get any sleep<br />Goodnight
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a true story of an autistic girl whose mother would not give up on her. She herself says Claire Danes is perfect for the role and how it's portrayed is just the way she sees things. Even my great aunt, who never watches tv or movies was impressed with this and telling everyone about it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really fun time consuming game. Stops you from being bored all day. It is also pretty easy but not to easy some levels are pretty challenging.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|If I could give this 2.5 stars, I would. I rounded up to 3 rather than down to 2 based on the strength of the previous two books in the trilogy.<br /><br />My primary complaints have been well covered by other reviewers. In short, the character and the plot development were poor. In particular, while the chapters transitioned between the POV of Tris and Tobias, they lacked a distinct voice. Also, given that the previous two books did not employ this technique, I have a feeling that the ending was not as pre-determined and well thought out as Roth claims. Also, while I understood the allegory for racism in today's society, I didn't buy the mechanism which allowed for said allegory. I don't want to give the plot or the 'big reveal' about the outside world away, but if felt to me that the author did not do much research into her topic beyond the 1950s developments in that field.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|5star<br />Amazingly useful to have a dictionary me my friends and family members think this too I use it for work
B00F2362IE|2.0|It's a decent endless runner game, but the load times are way too long. And in later parts there is a lot of lag.<br /><br />I really wanted to like it. If it could be more responsive it would easily be a 4 star game.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Small book, big message.  Is an easy, uncomplicated read written with thought, kindness and much love.  I have given this book many times as gifts.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|A long and fabulous book.  The characters will remain with you forever since they are described in such thick detail.  The plot is so clever and so intriguing.  The book asks some serious questions, among them, &#34;Why should we live?&#34; and makes the reader question all the twists and turns in his own life depending on the circumstances that occured.  I do think you need to be an above average reader to understand this book.  I rate it among the best I have ever read.  Donovan
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had read this year's ago and am so :) happy that I read it again before seeing the movie.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  The characters will remain with you for your lifetime.  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn ranks among the American classics like To Kill a Mockingbird and Huckleberry Finn.  To live without having read this book is tragic.  Donovan
B000068PQ0|5.0|How did I let a decade pass before discovering this album?  I don't know, it's a mystery.  I've been waiting for a moment to write a review, but the moment never comes.  But now it has, and from now on I will be ego tripping at the gates of hell - if I pass the fight test and prevent the evil robots from eating me, that is.  Thank you Flaming Lips for blowing my mind.  Wish there were six stars to deliver, but where does the sunshine end and the starlight begin?  It's a mystery.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|im sure the movie was great buy i couldnt finish it due to sound issues. hope i can get a refund
0399255370|5.0|My 4 yr son rreceivedthis book from his aunt, he l oves it.  We read it the first time and he immediately went to his crayons and drew a picture.  He took it to his prek class where they borrowed it for 3 days to read and di activities.  Great inspirational creative book.  A must have for all preschool - 1st grade.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Oh My Gosh I'm in loveeeee with this book!!! I'm reading it again and can't wait for the movie!! Eekk
B00GJ8K3G8|4.0|Nice album from one half of the old Rhapsody.  Seems this time that the songs are more riff based and the guitar has more of a role, including the bass which is more audible in the mix.  Maybe not their best album but a good addition to their catalogue.  It is not as fast paced as their first few albums and includes a high number of mid tempo songs.  I however enjoy the mid tempo songs a lot so this isn't a problem for me.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Nice evenly paced book.<br /><br />Should read if u like court room dramas.<br /><br />Wouldn't want to say more coz I may give away something in the story unintentionally.<br /><br />Enjoy
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Tongue-in-cheek fun with lots of laughs.  Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Tony Shaloub and all others were comical and made me laugh put loud.  A  great night's entertainment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever I think you should definitely get this game. you collect bananas run into minions if you are reading this try it and then rate it yourself I bet you will give it the best review yet. Try it I'm telling you I MEAN IT!!!!!!!!!!!! (It's fun really really fun) ps I am really awesome.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book was slightly difficult to get started. I put it down once and restarted at a later date. Once I understood the concept of the narrator, I was hooked.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I'm a girl and I normally don't really care for games base  on Monday lies but I LOVE this one! I really feel like I'm in the movie and its pretty easy to win! Recommended for EVERYONE!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great game defently worth it great graphics great guns and awesome animals and awesome upgrades best deer hunting game ever have to have it
0374104093|3.0|This is a strange dreamy sort of book, with a somewhat directionless feel to it and the usual goopy, horrifying environmental elements common to much of Mr. VanderMeer's previous work. While it's an interesting read, I don't believe I'll continue with the rest of the series, primarily because the narrator and her journey (both internal and external) just don't appeal to me all that much.<br /><br />The main character is a biologist whose name we never learn, one of four members of an expedition to a mysterious region called Area X. I can't say a whole lot about what they find there, or what happens to them there, without ruining the deliberate way the author withholds relevant bits of information from the reader in order to build a sense of mystery and suspense. Suffice it to say that they come across all manner of strange and possibly deadly creatures, react in various ways to the tensions of their ill-defined mission, and have to grapple with contamination/purity issues on a very personal level; this issue accounts for a lot of the novel's considerable squick factor. The narrator is a solitary person with a track record of deliberately losing herself in the environments she studies, which may explain why she's the one telling the story.<br /><br />Mr. VanderMeer is certainly a good writer, and I have enjoyed some of his previous work a great deal more than I enjoyed this novel. It lacks narrative drive, and (as I mentioned above) the main character doesn't really work for me. If you like books that drift along and combine horror and science fiction elements, you may get more out of this than I did. If not, you may want to leave this title out of your to-read pile.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have had this app for over a year. I love it because I can find some amazing ideas for my family, hose, boyfriend, a.d even ideas for my friends wedding and my future wedding
B003Y3GTU0|5.0|These are absolutely the best fitting non-hurting sandals in the world. I get blisters just by looking at sneakers and forget heels. These have never given me any blisters and are extremely comfortable to walk in. I have ordered at least 5 pairs (the problem is they wear out after walking on cement over a season) and I neeeeeddddd more!! BRING THEM BACK FOR NEXT SUMMER CROCS OR ALL YEAR PLEASE!!! SOME OF US LIVE IN WARM CLIMATES AND NEED THE SANDALS!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abby and Season 3 is the best by far. A must see show. each show has a surprize.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Who dosen't enjoy the Harry Potter series. I read them all and saw all the movies at the theater and then bought the CD's to boot. I guess you could say I was hooked.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This dongle is about the best thing since sliced bread. I love that on my second tv, the only thing plugged into the back is this little guy. Plus the new additions of Hulu Plus and HBO go have been fantastic. My one suggestion would be that the next addition be Flixster or Vudu. That way my movie collection could be readily available via Chromecast. This player is simple, elegant, and absolutely amazing.
B009VMN3RA|2.0|This book was readable....like a high school essay..... I must say that Shirley Mclaine comes across as a selfish and thoughtless woman..... Not a very loving mother at all. Her mantras must be &#34;ME&#34;<br />Mantram not mantras..... Actually a disturbing little cry for help from a young woman,.... only child or not, who apparently doesn't recieve much monetary help from her tight fisted mother......so what else could she do but write a book...... My conclusion is that Shirley is not a nice person....not nice or giving ...hardly &#34;new age&#34;<br />This book left a bitter taste in my mouth....a self-centered Charlatan is really what this story is about....
B00A2H9P98|5.0|One word!  AWESOME!!!!!!!  This movie is action-packed!  Jamie Foxx was absolutely great!  This movie goes along the line with Olympus Has Fallen!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wholesome and enjoyable. I appreciate that each episode reaches a resolution -- they don't leave you hanging.  The characters are very real and well-acted.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Why this film never got the recognition it deserves is beyond me...I know that at the time of its release it was thought to be not politically correct which is hogwash. It is a spectacle with fantastic and realistic battle scenes and portrays events as they were...not the way our sensitive modern society would like them to be. It's history as seen from the Crusaders point of view...Buy It!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|the most negative review of this app complains about all the things it does that the user does not want it to do.  those are the default settings on the app.  i use the app all the time but you MUST set your preferences to get it to act to suit your needs. it will not automatically load things you do not want if you reset your preferences.  the absolute best thing this does is that you put files you want to transfer onto your devices into the folder on your laptop or desktop computer.  then you open dropbox on your device and move the file from dropbox into the app where you wish to use it.  it works best for print and audio files.  huge video files do not work as well in it.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|A few weeks ago I bought this mouse to use with MMOs, specifically Guildwars 2. I didn't need to dive deeply into the driver to setup different profiles. My hand is just under medium size and I don't have difficulty reaching all the buttons. I'm generally happy with this mouse. I don't give five stars unless the item really knocks my socks off. However this is a good product that I recommend to others. Please note that I do not use any of the supplied weights. And I don't have a need to often change DPI.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The construction is sturdy enough for general use. The side buttons have a different enough shape that my thumb can accurately tell which button is where fairly quickly. When I tried them the supplied weights seemed to work well. The metal weight storage tin is adequate for the job. The driver works well and is easy to setup. The mouse slides well on a mousing surface designed for laser based units. The lights that &#34;breathe&#34; are interesting but I think I will get tired of them.<br /><br />Cons:<br />While not a serious problem when using this mouse on a _smaller_ mousing surface I have to pick up the mouse to move it closer to the center of the surface. This is a little more difficult than usual because the shape of the mouse and its weight are a little too heavy to accurately move without activating the left side buttons. On a larger mousing surface I don't think this will become an issue. The point to take away is that when I pick up the mouse it's sometimes hard not to press one of the side buttons.<br /><br />Not sure where the problem is, driver?<br />Another possible problem is that I am now getting highly intermittent pointer hangs that last about half a second. This is only in GW2 during fast action. This happens about once or twice per hour and seems to be related to my system's high CPU usage, 95 to 100%. I did not have this problem using Microsoft's generic mouse driver with a different mouse.
B00004R99U|5.0|The story shows a lot of truth about the barbaric behaviors of upper class citizens judging others just who are truly more civilized/humane than the upper class whose idea of fun is to senselessly kill God's creation under the name of sport. For example they always hunt animals and tear down trees without considering how that animal's or plant's existence balances the biological food chain or our ecosystem.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great book, I enjoyed reading it and learning about the history surrounding the orphan train.<br />I will look for more books by this author.
B0013NAP2G|3.0|I prefer her music videos with her more up tempo songs. Not that she doesn't have some nice slow ones but I prefer to watch up tempo activity and music.
0992251656|5.0|Great Firefly Fan Fun, Great production values, well thought out interior box storage, and very well thought out rules make this board game a great addition to any gamers collection. I'll be buying any expansions that follow. No gripes here!
B003GQM52Q|5.0|Love Westerns and Kevin Costner, moreso when they're both put together. Amazing movie, and this was roughly my fifth time watching it (Yes, you can keep count, because it's 3 hours long, and worth every second.)
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really fun game, but wish crystals would come faster. Great way to burn some time, though. Give it a try!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|My boyfriend is looked at me in terror when he caught me playing this game. I told him that it's alright, because I would NEVER consider shooting that animal unless I planned to turn it into supper! Awesome game. Thank you and keep up the good work.
0061122416|5.0|This book was great.  I think it is my new go to book when I want to feel that anything is possible.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wow!!!  An amazing book with a twist. I couldn't put it down. It's a must read for all. Loved it!!!
076780421X|5.0|I'm so in love with this movie! It makes me just happy (and a bit weepy in spots). Glad to see I'm not the only one in search of this awesome soundtrack, either! Can anyone help with that?
0143038583|5.0|Great insights into the food industry.  Warning, this book may affect what you think and and you feel about food.  Very well researched and factual.
B00902AKK4|5.0|This was such a fun game and really made me think sometimes.  My only complaint, not enough levels and no sequel yet, but as soon as it comes out I will gladly buy it!!!
B0002HZSE4|5.0|Beautifully hand painted horse. I can't wait to give it to my granddaughter for Christmas!  Goes well with the horse stable and veterinary hospital sets I also purchased!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is really cool! The only thing that I would change would be that when you are competing, that you have to do so much. And all the horses are really expensive for me because I WILL NOT buy anything with real money in any game. Overall really good game.
B00000DF6O|5.0|A later album by BB, very solid and well-crafted - one of my favorites.  He still sings with the rich deepness of his younger voice and his band is spot on with supporting arrangement.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|By far, my favorite cd of Pat's. Hard to put into words, arrangements are fantastic. Compositions incredible. Musicians, incredible. If you haven't heard his music before, start with this one.
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|It is everything I hoped it would be. Packaging is similar to the earlier Miles Davis Complete Columbia Albums Collection, but ships with better protection, inside a well-padded outer box - so there should be no damaged boxes this time around. Some of the first few editions of this mega box set shipped with flawed copies of \\"Hard Rain\\" (disc No. 22), mine was one of them, but a replacement \\"Hard Rain\\" disc was quickly and painlessly supplied directly from Sony Music.<br /><br />So, what we have here are all 41 official studio albums - including the first-ever North American release of 1973's \\"Dylan\\" album on CD! There are also 14 newly remastered titles, as well as the 2-CD \\"Side Tracks\\" collection, which brings together numerous previously released non-album singles, tracks from the earlier Biograph boxed set, from films, and other compilations. It all makes for a grand and immersive way of rediscovering the truly remarkable work of this titan of popular music.
B0091WR678|5.0|Such a fantastic movie! Loved watching this over and over again; each time I saw it something new popped up that I hadn't noticed before. Buying from Amazon video was a breeze too!
B008JDAC7G|4.0|Quick download to my kindle fire hd. Good graphics and quick gameplay. Easy for all ages to understand and a great time waster. Will probably keep for awhile.
1616550414|5.0|This is a incredible product to zelda's fans. There's a lot of information about the games and the official chronology.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great fun.  Easy to play.  Many options.  The only problem with FREE apps are the advertisements and the extra time it requires to get rid of them.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Indispensable to Star Wars' fans. This collection is amazing, beyond the six movies in full hd version, there's a lot of content to keep fans entertained for hours.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Holy Moley this girl can wail.  Susan's got pipes.  The boy can certainly tear up some wire.  Daryl's got nimble fingers.  Great entertainment.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I wept through much of the end of this book. I am so thankful for courageous men and women who serve our country and give their lives for nation. Adam's example of courage, self-sacrifice, and Kelly's touched me deeply. I recommend this book to anybody who wants to better understand the courage and sacrifice our military men and women  make for country, both those of their family and on the field.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I just wish there were more episodes.  I did not want to see this series end.
1451662440|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger had a dream and he made it come true: to succeed in whatever he did and be the best in it. Celebrity autobiographies can self-serving or quite revealing. I believe Schwarzenegger’s is somewhat unique for the things he was able to achieve so far in his 66 years. Here is a man who took upon himself four major tasks in his life: bodybuilding, business, acting and politics. He was remarkably successful in the first three, and it is debatable how good he was in the last one. Certainly he should be admired for his accomplishments.<br /><br />Schwarzenegger was a force to be reckoned with in bodybuilding and physical fitness, something he describes in the first quarter of his autobiography. He set goals, planned carefully, applied himself with immense dedication, and he succeeded. What is equally remarkable is that he enjoyed it and recommends it to others, supporting fitness programs wherever he went. Immigrating to California in his teens, he followed his dreams of participating in action movies while also building up business interests in real estate and investments. The Austrian Oak, as he called himself, is also a gregarious and outspoken person who makes friends quickly and who influenced many others. While critics may disparage his capabilities in front of movie cameras, he nevertheless proved that ambition and realistic goals can guide a life merely by the sheer application of both body and mind. He tells us that he was a millionaire before his prominent movies really took off because his investments worked. He took the phrase “it’s not possible” and turned it around into “I can do it!” His personal vision for himself never wavered; his is a true rags-to-riches story. It is quite appropriate to label him as one of the hardest working people in the world.<br /><br />Reading his lengthy book, it strikes me that this is no ordinary athlete who pumped iron and wanted a center stage for himself. Arnold Schwarzenegger earned every inch of his fame and fortune, and part of that was by brains and not just by brawn. He knew what worked and what didn’t work for him, and he never wanted a dull moment. It is hard to think of his story being anything more, really, than total dedication to a goal, something that almost anyone else can do if they used the same kind of enthusiasm and perseverance. The main theme of Schwarzenegger’s life is work hard, do the right thing, feed the whole person, look after the economy from the family up, and be generous to those less fortunate. If Americans awarded knighthoods, ‘Sir Arnold’ would be high on the totem according to these basics.<br /><br />I am a fan of the science fiction films he helped make, and it is interesting to hear him tell us what he thought were improvements in each of them, in how he refused many projects in order to stick with his vision for himself and for his followers. In a way, he used psychological acumen in business to get him through his obstacles and achieve his objectives. You have got to admire that sort of spirit.<br /><br />When Schwarzenegger entered California politics in 2003, he wanted big changes for the state. It is very compelling to read his interpretations of those problems: huge debts, corruption of unions, fixed tax laws, overspending. It is also disconcerting to read how he apparently caved in to pressures at first. In the chapter “The Governator”, Schwarzenegger says that he felt he had lost when he pushed too hard for change. “The voters thought they were getting a diet pill… (but) I had turned around and asked them to meet me in the gym… for five hundred push-ups… I’d taken too confrontational an approach…I hadn’t really listened to the people. We had overreached…”  Schwarzenegger, I believe, was too hard on himself. In point of fact, he had told the people what needed to be done, and they had not listened. It is strange to hear a committed fighter and doer like him say that he was totally responsible, but that is his graciousness. He led, but the union-inebriated populace refused to let go of their goodies. Not your fault, Arnold. The hordes of low-information voters who shoved California into debt under unionized propaganda should know better.<br /><br />Voters get what they deserve when they turn away from the hard fixes, and Schwarzenegger’s were hard but required fixes. That’s’ how republicanism always works. They failed to listen even more so when the downturn of 2008 hit. If Schwarzenegger was unpopular by then, it wasn’t for lack of his warnings about poor management by citizens of their own home affairs. The housing crisis, after all, was almost entirely due to consumer greed. I would disagree with Schwarzenegger’s view on global warming and his move to the center to work with liberals, but I still agree with his total viewpoint. I am pleased that he admits his faults. There’s a telling paragraph in the opening of the chapter titled “Arnold’s Rules” about his many contradictions. That’s honesty, and you rarely get it from the Hollywood set.<br /><br />This is an autobiography worth reading, lengthy as it is, because it teaches something very basic and important. Not everyone can be great in business, not everyone can star in movies and not all are cut out to be leaders, but everyone can be healthy and active. Take away the film stardom and the politics and the property investments, and what you have left, as Arnold Schwarzenegger showed us, is achievable fitness for the body and the mind. And that’s worth every ounce of sweat and every effort put toward it. I believe that this is what Schwarzenegger will ultimately be remembered most for, and it is a noble thing.<br /><br />I am giving him 5 stars because I like what he says. Normally, most autobiographies would rate three or two from me.onsible, but that is his graciousness. He led, but the union-inebriated populace refused to let go of their goodies.

0545626382|5.0|These are fantastic books.  I have bought 3 and plan to buy more.  I am a Special Needs teacher and my student do not like to read.  There are enjoying these books.
B0050BEM1M|1.0|Why would you want to watch these boring, badly spoken nothings, with bad hair, bad faces and bad manners on film? You can see and hear them at any Tesco's supermarket any day if you want to. Truly awful!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Despite the false advertising claiming how easy this is to set up I could not get it to work with my router. After hours of trying different settings it would not connect to my Wifi. More time with tech support was fruitless. This item is not ready for prime time. It is unbelievable that it does not connect to my Wifi like ALL my other devices. Now I have to send it back. Total waste of time.
0985557834|5.0|Great book.  Have taught several classes using the well written instructions.  Now a staple in our craft fair offerings.  Publisher wants massive bulk order to get discount, so we offer it at cost as as a courtesy to our customers.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Pure poetry. An album that is full of heartbreak on paper. His lyrics and alto voice lure me to a magical place.
098555780X|5.0|Great book.  Have taught several classes using the well written instructions.  Now a staple in our craft fair offerings.  Publisher wants massive bulk order to get discount, so we offer it at cost as as a courtesy to our customers.
B005HS00NW|5.0|&#34;Hurry Up, We're Dreaming&#34; has a cadence and emotionalism that sends the listener into a trance.In my opinion, one of the best albums of the past 20 years.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The Best show. Has it all. The drama and one-liners. Its quick, fast paced and you don't want to miss a line, because if you do, you'll be lost. Excellent!!! And who can resist Gabriel Macht… Droool!!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This book is AWESOME!! I would defiantly read it again. I have said to heaps of people that I know &#34; have you read this series?&#34; If they said no than I would say &#34;than you should read it! It will be the best book you have ever read
B00992CF6W|5.0|this so awesome s have on this and ipod highly recommended u should get it get it get it get it
1452110581|1.0|Interesting. I tried to download this but it would only go to &#34;selected&#34; readers, not my kindle. What is up with this? So really, I can't give it a review because Amazon which, is becoming more and more like Walmart, sadly. So my review is based solely on my not being able to read the book. Sorry!
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|I love this game. I play it everyday its a lot like another game I play.  for a free game you get a lot out of it. definitely get this app!!!!!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|An excellently told story, solid four stars, the vehicle is a little cliché, and I did not enjoy a couple of the episodes as &#34;so what&#34; but am still enjoying the story and am eager to have all the plots coalesce in the third day.  When is it coming out?!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I played for a short while for free and now it won't let me play unless I buy stuff.  Not really free is it?
B000QGAU4E|2.0|The cinematography was dark, watch I'm sure was on purpose considering the subject matter. It was difficult to follow at times but that isn't always the movie's fault but the viewer. This rely like a stone soup kind of movie lacking appetizing content.
B003G4W49C|4.0|needed more of an ending then it has my copy reads like it was incomplete<br />Hope you have better luck at the movie
B007NVIB5U|5.0|This series has everything. Good writing, and great talent. It's funny and the characters are uplifting. Great story of friendship, loyalty, self discovery.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved using the old app.  Looked at it everyday.  Easy to use.  The old app was great.  I cannot stand the new one.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|You should get this app it is not a waste of money the best weather all I have ever seen it is once again AWESOME I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Why?<br />Wow.... Just wow...<br />What an awful way to end a book... I thought that books where for enjoyment and not made to make you angry....<br />The book was great until the end.. I would never recommend this series to anyone just so they don't have experience the awful end of this book ...<br />This just ruined my day.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I loved this movie.  I loved the original with Redford and was excited to see this.  I was not disappointed.
0399255370|5.0|Great book for kids. Gift for my Great Niece for Christmas. I'm sure she'll enjoy it. She loves to read.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I was excited to read this after all the other great reviews.  I thought the book was good, but not great, and no where close to A Time to Kill or the Firm.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I love Jane Austen.  This version of Northlanger Abbey is pretty good. The villians are easy to dislike for sure.
B005I3PAUO|5.0|Love Baldacci's style. Keeps moving...，characters have depth. Keep writing and I'll keep reading.<br />Politics is an interesting subject to write about... However, truth is stranger than the most outlandish fiction.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|These gals crack me up! Product exactly as promised, and shipped quickly!
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|Story and 3D effects were excellent. Even my wife was impressed. Will get the next part for home viewing instead of paying top dollar at the theater.
0802473156|5.0|The book was as advertised, and I appreciated it coming when promised.  Will use you again.  Nothing more to say.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Mouse is great so far.<br /><br />The thumb placement design is really great and the thumb button layout puts everything within reach of it. The raised bumps on the middle of the three buttons is a nice tactile feature (like the keyboard home row bumps).  The ridges offer better grip.<br /><br />Software seems good so far. I don't really use it to the extent it should be though so can't comment there. The Anker logo color on the mouse can be changed.  Nothing else that glows changes however.  Doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Great mouse.  Would buy again.
B00DNB9RXO|4.0|Naught is a very different game of moving the spooky cat you see in the game logo around an underground set of puzzle environments, gathering objects you need to advance to the next level. I recommend using &#34;tilt&#34; mode ... the game is both easier and more natural in tilt mode than trying to use buttons to control the screen angle and thus the cat's movements. The cat will always move downhill, so you control which direction he moves and whether he stops by controlling the slope of his environment.<br /><br />The game doesn't have intrusive permissions, but I dock a star because it also does not cleanly exit. It remains in memory as a &#34;background process&#34;, probably to allow a quick resumption of where you are in the game. However, that's not what I want an app to do when I'm done with it. I want it to terminate and not use resources on my device.<br /><br />I played this with a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 without any performance issues.<br /><br />I expect that this game will appeal greatly to some, but probably not everyone. Check it out while it is the Free App of the Day to see if you are one of the people who will love it.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I like the Jack Reacher series and had never read the first one, also recently read the High Heat novella about him in his teenage years.  Lee's books keep you interested throughout the book and I have a hard time putting it down.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|I watch this movie at least once every Christmas season.  I absolutely love it!  The acting and the settings are<br />wonderful.  I wish they made movies like this now days that the whole family can sit down and watch.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I enjoyed how easy it was to grasp the notion of realizing our true purpose, this book is worth reading a few times. Thank you Steven for writing this from the heart so that we may paint from ours.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very colorful writing, full of metaphors that clearly enhance the story. Zusak has created a character in Liesel Meminger that you will truly care about, while bringing the lives of the German people under the Nazi regime right into your lap. While it is essentially a story for (sophisticated) teenagers, &#34;The Book Thief&#34; is great reading for adults as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to finally be able to get this app for my Kindle. I couldn't get it for my android phone. I would sit &amp; watch my wife play and would want to try it but couldn't. So now I get to be just as addicted to it as she is. It's a fun and challenging game!! I love it and are only in the beginning of the game!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series and book are all a rollercoaster of emotions. You will be on the edge of your seat every turn of the page. The thrill in this book will catch you like no other.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I loved it for a while and am on level 29..now when I get down to 5 moves or so and clear the last fruit on screen it decides to sneak in a fruit from the top just so I cant clear the board!! EVERY SINGLE TIME! I'm sick of trying and refuse to pay for ONLY 5 more moves when it doesn't even help!! Deleting game unless or until it gets changed and is easier to clear harder levels! More than a week on same level gets boring!!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this game is so awesome i never want to stop playing this game. thank you gameloft for making this game
B00506NRBS|5.0|Short. Easy to read. Great story and message. Thank you Derek for setting the example of someone who is living a full life.  Well done.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|:)<br />Good game.. just need to be able to upgrade with out paying so much. Other than that this game is fun!!!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It worked for like a week now it won't download anymore. Please fix the app. Only for to download one short commercial doesn't and won't download just does in download area with no progress.
B00FAVRHBE|4.0|I thought I would hate the War Doctor, but, without giving out any spoilers, I was pleasantly surprised by the character. My youngest granddaughter (9) has been a Whovian since Series 9. I watched an episode of Dr Who and am now hooked myself! I've always been a Sci-Fi nut, and love the playfulness and chemistry between the characters! Doesn't jive with scientific accuracy?  HELLO!!! This if Science FICTION! I have Seasons 1-7 and can't wait for Season 8 - the ending of Day of the Doctor left an unexpected &#34;cliffhanger&#34;! Wonder what Davies & Moffatt will have up their sleeves now?
0399160477|1.0|Why isn't this book available in paperback?<br /><br />I want to get this book for my dad as a gift and he doesn't have a Kindle.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|I thought I knew everything about ‘Scarface’ until I read this incredibly informative little book. I can’t believe I was watching the same movie as this guy. He breaks it down shot by shot and there’s so much I missed. It’s a fascinating book about a fascinating movie.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Very fun to play. Wish I wouldn't have to wait on time to continue playing since I'm super cheap. Great game though.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game I just wish it had a day and night cycle though. And also I wish there was more suits to pick from bit otherwise this game is GREAT!!!
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|Kind of a sad movie, but as every child movie should - it cheers up at the end and has a good message for kids.  I love the convenience of renting it to my kindle in the comfort of my bed!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|awesome book I really enjoyed it. I'm excited to read the next two books! I hope they are just as good and everything works out for Katniss
B005LAII0S|4.0|The whole family loved the movies and Julia Roberts played the part perfectly!!  Very Enjoyable and we watch it over again more than we thought we would.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because it was so well written and it was a real cliff hanger I loved this book. I fell in love with all the characters and if you have an interest in this book I think that you with enjoy it lottles it's  like a little but a lot so I really hope that u will buy this book
B005LAIGWS|2.0|It was nothing like the first movie that actually had a story to follow.  This one was all about the 3D effects which I thought did not even help the film at all.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I like the game a lot. If I could recommend this game to anyone it would be a 8 9 10 year old
B002SGYPS2|5.0|Tremendous story.  Makes one think about how our future is going with reality shows and the very last scene puts it all in perspective..... Next!  However, this story shows how the human race has a level of curiosity that once piqued, it cannot be put away.
B00EKXDVOK|1.0|This is an odd combination of traditional songs and attempts to modernize them. I listened one time and will not listen again. If I could get a refund I would. This is not worth even the low MP3 only price, much less the CD price. I am a fan of the singer but not  of this effort.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Compelling story line coupled with superb acting by awesome cast. Brought tears to my eyes and still heartbroken! Season 4 coming next month, so get ready!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|The only thing that would make this album better is if Shania was recording new hits again.  The energy of her songs is absolutely infectious.  I'm glad to get this album!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Won't allow to me connect to facebook or play without connecting just keeps loading. Please fix would rather play on my kindle than my iPhone
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is and always will be a great, GREAT musical.  There's a live performance coming to television this season of this film; I was shocked to find that my great nieces and nephews had never seen the original and just couldn't let that pass.  Since I no longer have a working VHS player, I invested in this DVD and am certainly glad I did.  Not only do I get to educate the younger generation, I get to watch the film again myself...no advertisements!<br /><br />I'm shocked that anyone would even try to perform this Julie Andrews iconic film.  This particular combo includes a &#34;sing-along&#34; special, special scenes that didn't appear in the film, both a Blu-ray and a DVD version.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|It's a fun game, but this implementation is a little rough around the edges.  It's slow, it eats battery like a kid eats candy, and I worry it's going to make my phone overheat.  And it's a phone that can handle much heavier applications without trouble.<br /><br />The game itself is great, and the app is fun, I'm not going to uninstall it or anything, unless a better implementation of the game were to appear.  But the devs didn't include the best expansions, the AI is okay but prone to bad choices, and the app is pretty resource-hungry.  So if you don't know if you like Carcassonne, this is probably not the ideal way to check it out.  But if you like the game, and have an Android, this is the best we've got, for now.
0062082841|5.0|I bought this for a friend who loves scary movies.  I do not.  She assures me she loves the book!
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Not as good as her last album, but still enjoyable. Some of the tunes are really catchy and her voice is still there.
B000002J1M|5.0|I got this record on its initial promoted release- very late 1972 or early '73, which made me either 14 or 15 at the time (yes, that impressionable age.)  I remember buying 'Foxtrot' on a whim without ever hearing it, or the band, before (those 4 albums for $10 sales were great back in the day!) and before I knew what hit me Supper's Ready' became the 'it' song (cycle) for me.  'It' blew away everything every other band at the time was trying to accomplish with that 'long-form concept' thing; now, at this point in my life, I wonder if this is even a subjective statement. (The only song-cycle that eventually surpassed? it for me was, you guessed it- 'The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway', though I really don't like to think of these sorts of things in a competitive sense.)  'Supper's Ready' is, among other things, a breath-taking aural puzzle that was impossibly intriguing. Not long after getting into it I remember reading T.S. Eliot's 'The Waste Land', in search of 'clues.'  Was it really 23 minutes long? It always went by so fast! I never remember stopping it until it was over. Along with the album's opener, the incredible, ominous 'Watcher of the Skies', and side two's (how can you NOT think of this record without thinking of it in terms of sides???) opener 'Horizons', 'Foxtrot' more than earns its niche as one of the seminal albums of the period, and was the first of Genesis' great triumvirate of records. And to witness both 'Supper's Ready' and 'Watcher of the Skies' live was, well, let's just say I saw them in late '73 for the first time, third row seats (I was lucky enough to see Genesis with Gabriel 4 times.) Of course the album does have imperfections. Are all of the lesser tracks, (everything on side one after 'Watcher') well, basically lesser? You bet. Is the production less than top-notch? Check. Can you find echoes, bits and pieces, from this or that band of that particular period of time on this? Most definitely (a little<br />Moody Blue/King Crimson here, aBeatle-esque bit there, 'Roundabout'-like keyboard trilling, flute-playing lead singer.) Does any of that matter? Of course not! And today I often wonder if the low-fi production values made me gravitate to it even more. I suppose most art/music lovers have memories in their mind's eye of certain works that they love that have also altered them in some fashion; I often think of all the albums I've listened to over the past fifty years, maybe 4 or 5 have done that for me, and 'Foxtrot' was one.
B000R2SXJ6|5.0|Hendrix masterpiece!  I really don't know what else to say.  Standout tracks are Crosstown Traffic, All Along the Watchtower and Voodoo Child.  For a double album everything is good on here.  A necessity for any rock fans collection along with Are You Experienced.
B003UYUP58|5.0|More than a biography of cancer. A total science lesson written with eerie attention to detail! Highly captivating and readable.
B000VBIEXS|5.0|This is when ELP were at their peak.  There is not a bad song on the whole album.  Standout track is Karn Evil #9.  Another classic piece of progressive rock for any collection.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Has lots of available versions and the speaker in the KJV sounds like a Brit. Easy to use and of course works on tablets and phones.
B000002KL3|4.0|Eddie Van Halen has said he didn't like this one too much because it was the first album of all material written in the studio.  It may have a couple of filler tracks but the songs And the Cradle Will Rock and Everybody Wants Some make up for this.
B0048Y9TPG|5.0|I love this song I play it all the time during the Christmas season. Its fun to decorate the tree and bake to.
B000S00YNA|5.0|A great follow up to Demons and Wizards.  One of their best albums.  It has the hits Blind Eye and Sweet Lorraine.  A necessity to any Heep fans collection.
B00BXDOSXS|1.0|Things I want to watch requires me to download most current of adobe flash player and for wherever reason my kindel fire HD won't do it.  So much for viewing whatever you want whenever you want!
6305076995|5.0|This is a great DVD from Yes.  It was done during their Close to the Edge tour.  Only thing missing from this is a performance of Starship Trouper.
0142413828|1.0|This book starts as a really sweet story but in the end turns out to be a very poor message for a child. It basically teaches that a man can pull the wool over a woman's eyes and lie to her to get her to fall in love with him. At the end I was waiting for him to tell her the truth but he never did. I know Roald Dahl is a great author but this was the first book of his I read to my 5 year old and I wasn't impressed with it overall.
B000002B7Y|4.0|Really Ozzy's first 6 studio albums were all great, but this one is unique because it introduced Zakk Wylde.  Standout tracks are Miracle Man and Crazy Babies.  This combination only gets better with the next album No More Tears.
B00DNB9RXO|3.0|The game has nice short levels that are good for filling a moment here or there, but it force closed on completing a level 3 or 4 times out of the 7 levels I played before deciding it wasn't worth the frustration and uninstalled.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I love an ending to a great story.  Dan Torrence brings The Shining closure for this reader. Gotta love Stephen King!!
B00006D295|5.0|I mean who doesn't love this movie? Great soundtrack as well. I do think it's odd that Susan S. denies that she was ever in this movie????
B008ALAHA4|3.0|Does what it's supposed to, allows you to use old mac charges with the newer macs. The design is bad from the point of view that I will easily misplace it when I connect the mac charger to my old mac. Had to buy MagCozy for ensuring I don't lose the small converter.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|This same set is only $35 at the Lego store. I saw several of them yesterday. You'll still save money by ordering from Lego and paying the shipping.
B005IF7HNA|4.0|This boxed set is a great value, even when you consider that we're paying money for series 4 / Miracle Day.
0449911357|5.0|This was an amazing story that triumphs the silver screen's adaptation. Although I'll always love the movie version of this book, the book and it's great detail and ornate relationship building qualities with so many more poignant characters was such a wonderful aspect. Anyone who enjoyed the movie, this book is a MUST read!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is definitely worth the download its not hard to use the and the numbers are very easy to see its just your basic everyday calculator I downloaded this app for myself and my kids it's very convenient I don't have to look for it to use it and best of all you can't lose it virtual calculator I love it!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Memorized by the plot.  Thoroughly enjoyed every page.<br />Worth the read and well worth the time.<br />Very quick read. Enjoy
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The game injustice bring all the characters that u love from DC the action is and style with there heroes and villains unique it a game
0385537131|4.0|This book is masterly crafted by Grisham with an exciting and an involved and clever plot.  Ths would make an excellent gift.
B00EPVTLKU|5.0|I love you infinity beyond that is why I love you so much I wish you were my twin sister because I am very pretty! I love you !
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book reminded me that every choice we make in life is part of a bigger picture that reaches beyond ourselves.  Great read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing. The graphics in this are amazing. It is like you have a real house. You can even train it!
B00506NRBS|5.0|Derek writes about his experiences with honesty and clarity. I would recommend this book to anyone starting or already in business. I have owned a business for fourteen years and can identify with his message of hope, integrity, and the desire to help others. Good job.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This is the best game EVER I LOVE IT I built houses trapped a wolf killed wildboars I am in love
B00992CF6W|5.0|you can die in creative mode. just mine to the middle of the earth and fall tho tho tho tho
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Good app., but can be tricky to set up. It's easy to forget &quot;Save&quot; after setting an alarm. Instructions advise having device connected to electrical outlet, because of battery usage. In my particular situation this is not convenient. There isn't an outlet near by. It does not have as many clock faces as the description makes one believe. But, it is a worthwhile app.
0062107313|1.0|I have read all of Amy Tan's books and have enjoyed them all, so was excited to see this new book. Sadly to say, it is just dreadful. It's a long meandering mess. The writing had no beauty at all. It was obvious that the publisher asked Tan to add some graphic  sex scenes to spice up an otherwise boring story and bland flat characters. I only finished because I had hoped to see something of Tan's talent reveal itself. Unfortunately, it's just not there. I do not recommend anyone spend their limited reading time to this book--there are too many great books out there.
B00E1LQ7Q0|3.0|Probably my favorite CD in the past year was the 20/20 Experience, which my son bought on CD, so I purchased it on vinyl. My son (of course) put the CD into his digital computer library so I had the CD to listen to at home. Eventually I purchased the 20/20 experience in vinyl for myself.<br /><br />Anyway....when I heard that JT was releasing the &#34;complete&#34; package I pre-ordered the double CD.<br /><br />TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!<br /><br />In a nutshell, without going track by track through two CD's here's what I think happened. JT had a couple dozen songs and spent the time in the studio recording, mixing and mastering all of the tunes.  And as usually happens, a bunch of songs popped out as being the best of the bunch. Those ended up on the orginal 20/20 CD. THAT CD WAS GREAT, and like I said, it was (still is) one of my favorite CD's released in the past year!. So JT's managers/business associates, and the &#34;little voice in his head&#34; all agreed that it would be a great idea to milk the market for more sales by realeasing the double package.<br /><br />Well, it's the 2013 equivalent of releasing an album with fillers, outakes and rejects from a recording session. The first time I listened to the orginal 20/20 CD, I had several songs stuck in my head and I couldn't stop listening to the CD. In fact I listened to it several time a day. The first time I listened to the &#34;part 2&#34; disc...absolutely nothing stuck. I listened a second, then a third time, and still, I really can't name any of the songs. It was a just a waste.<br /><br />I still listen to the part one disc, but the second CD won't see the insides of a CD player again.
B003O86FMW|1.0|Awful ending should have stopped after book one the last two books made me hate the series especially the ending of book 3
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I'm enthralled with this series.  Top writing, acting, direction!  Didn't watch it for a long time because I heard the protagonist was a meth pusher.  Glad I got by that!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I got this for my tablet and I could play this ALL DAY......mesmerizing! I lost it on my home computer, and was devastated!
1455525839|5.0|Just loved the book.  I think it is their best yet and I love the entire Pendergast series.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Just started playing today. Yes, it's addictive. Can't put it down the graphics are good and it keeps your mind challenged.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Hey, l at that!  That thing went totally squiggly!  Try to remember that, next time you squeeze your ears, okay?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's a really good book and if you like the movies you will love he books.they leave you jaw dropped and stunned because they're unpredictable.
B007THA4FI|5.0|A great, serious read. This is not fluff. This is life in all its absurdity, vileness, and hopefulness. Read it.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Fun but I do not use &quot;real&quot;money to play games.  Seems like I may not be able to expand or play to a higher level without harrassing friends to play along.  But so far so good.
1401937519|5.0|Incredible story of a woman whose cancer was miraculously cured by unexplained spontaneous remission after she has a near death experience in the hospital while on her deathbed!  This case seems unbelievable but has been documented by actual medical records and witnesses.  Ms Moorjani writes very well and tells her story well.  A great and inspirational book.
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|Great film by Quentin Tarentino! All the actors were perfect in their roles (the actor who stole the movie, Christoph Waltz was really good, showed lots of versatility!) Also enjoyed Brad Pitt as always and all the other actors (the actor playing Hitler was hilarious!)
B002BAWIWU|5.0|George is my favorite Beatle and I love the album. A must have for any Beatles fan. You won't be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like candy crush a lot because it is a bit different from the original jeweled game. I also like that you are able to play with Facebook friends, it makes it so much fun
B003L77G6A|5.0|We love Big Bang Theory and I purchased as a gift for my husbands birthday. It is high quality DVD and we have watched these DVD's numerous time.
B0047C2IIE|5.0|It's the essential Holiday classic!  I grew up with this album, and am delighted to listen to it each Christmas season!
1416972250|5.0|I accidentally bought these series of books thinking it was another author. I was immediately hooked and love the series.
B00BN2NY48|3.0|As somebody who has seen a few shows live, after seeing the trailer over and over I thought this move was going to an all new show but it's more of a sampler as it were for the newer shows. Like 'Love', 'O' & 'Viva Elvis'. The plot seemed poorly looped in but in the end eventually wound up tying together somehow.
B0053O89WY|5.0|We love Big Bang Theory and I purchased as a gift for my husbands birthday. It is high quality DVD and we have watched these DVD's numerous time.
0740797719|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK ABOUT LIGHT I HAVE EVER SEEN for artist reference. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I encourage my art students to purchase it as soon as they begin to ask questions about light and atmosphere. A real winner!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We love Big Bang Theory and I purchased as a gift for my husbands birthday. It is high quality DVD and we have watched these DVD's numerous time.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|WOW!!!!!!!!!!! This game is So much fun I love a lot it is very good for kids it is the perfect game for you or your kid
1449305172|5.0|Great book. I have read most of the 'Lean&#34; books but found this one to be the clearest and most applicable of them all. I have been using the lean principles in this book as far as is possible with my own start up. I find the principles apply best to the software development side of the business, but with a little imagination they could be relevant to all areas.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Because of all of the benefits it has.  It is a great resourse for books and magazines.  I will use it a lot!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|it was a good book it had a little bit of a disappointment to some people who like ball dances
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|fantastic! no need for expensive cable or sporadic dish. This works very well and is truly as easy as they say to install. It took me only a few minutes and they have since added HBOGo to the line up. Very happy with this purchase
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I just started playing this game today and i am hooked i cant stop playing it. It is the best game ever
B007MB5OCE|3.0|The book is a fun read, but it is so far fetch that it is hard not connect with reality. May it got lost in trans;ation.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|It's a shame you can't click half stars because I think this book is better than a 3 but not quite a 4.<br />I liked this book and found it easy to read from the start, so much so that I read it when I was meant to be reading for uni. It's a take on the classic love story; boy meets girl, boy doesn't want girl, boy wants girl, boy loses girl... I think you see where this is going. While I expected it to be formulaic, and that really didn't bother me, I was very disappointed with the ending. It seemed rushed and a bit lazy. I was able to identify with the characters throughout the story but the ending lacked charm or connection and I probably wouldn't recommend it.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|This is one of the better free games. Its not one that you breeze through,and power ups take a while to earn. The only thing is you have to figure out how to use the skills and such, some kind of directions should be available. But have not found any .
1476727651|4.0|I've been a fan of Stephen King since his first book came out.  This is a really good story.  The Shining is one of my favorites, so I enjoyed reading about what might have happened to Danny Torrance.
B00FLDG42Y|3.0|RUSH is the greatest band ever, for me at least.  You have to give these guys so much credit for still putting on a great show.  With that said, this is their worst live performance album.<br /><br />Geddy is straining and \\"working\\" to sing many of the songs. Guitar, keyboards, synths, techie and sequencer sounds...mostly great.  Drums and bass in most songs are not as distinct. (which is too bad- obviously). And this is not knocking Geddy AT ALL. The guy has been singing (almost non-stop for forty years, not to mention about 300 days out of a year in the 70's).  One can't expect his voice to sound great...but it just takes something away from many of the songs. Especially when he doesn't even enunciate lyrics correctly, \\"fluidly\\", or is just tired. This live cd does not compare to Exit Stage Left, Different Stages, or even the previous Time Machine Tour.  The strings make Red Sector A sound cluttered.  They are great for the CA songs, but just don't seem to add anything to YYZ either.<br /><br />This album reminds me of the third disc included from the Different Stages live cd's.  This was the concert from 1977 or 78 at the Hammersmith Odeon? in London.  Rush even said they were thinking of not choosing that show because Geddy was sick/had a cold.  You can tell.  Yet they decided on that show because it sounded great instrumentally.  Agreed...but when the singing is off- it is hard to get past that- and try to appreciate the music.  It's OK to sing lower Mr. Lee!(as in the Wreckers- played very well and Alex's floating guitar sound is something special.)  How great would it be to hear Hemispheres, even if Geddy can't sing like \\"that\\" anymore - 90% of Rush fans would love it.<br /><br />Grand Designs- glad they played it.  Limelight soundcheck- wow - Alex at his best.  The guitar effects in the middle of The Spirit of Radio are great.  Like an old grump, I listened to Exit Stage Left afterwards.  Is Terry Brown still working? :-)  Subdivisions sounds good, especially the keyboards, robust and loud (also on Tom Sawyer besides a minor slip-up near the beginning). Bravado- weakest version. Peke's Repose- excellent. Seven Cities of Gold- wish I could hear the ripping/thunderous bass playing and Alex stay quiet for a while. That song starts off so great and then descends into chaotic boredom, if that makes sense. Similarly, I wish I could hear Geddy's bass in Force Ten.  Wish Them Well- much better live, cool fan participation, and hilarious (Rush having fun).  The Garden- good, emotive song -the guitar solo is so clean, powerful, and one wishes that it would continue instead of the repetitive \\"it's a measure of a life\\" chorus.<br /><br />In summary, still worthwhile to buy, but some seasoned fans may be disappointed. I don't think I will be buying the dvd though - first time not buying a new Rush product. The short videos on this tour could not top the two videos from the previous Time Machine Tour.  All three should have received Oscar's for those skits. Anything by RUSH gets at least a 3 by default.  Best band, best music, best fans ever.  I hope they never retire.  Moreover, I hear the worst thing about retirement is that you never get a day off.:-)<br /><br />additional comments: 5 stars? RUSH is still great, but be realistic reviewers and fans.  Listen to ANY and/or ALL of their live albums, cds, whatever form (even All The World's a Stage), then listen to this cd on the same stereo.  Although some were a bit harsh on the dvd reviews, at least they were more realistic. RUSH has spoiled us throughout the years with their greatness.  While they were in the great zone on Analog Kid, Where's My Thing was disappointing. They were laboring through that song- although Neil's drum solo was good.<br /><br />I think and hope we will see them tour again and that they don't push themselves to play for 3 hours.  Moreover, they should not worry about producing a live cd or being perfect, and just have more fun. Maybe Geddy could write lyrics to some songs. (Clockwork Angels' theme was a bit puerile). Maybe they would even consider getting a singer to help Geddy (never thought I'd see a string section), and free him up for more slappa of da bass!
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|every time I exit the game it says I have to force close it so it gets really annoying so I give it three stars because its awesome but you can only play on single player
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My favorite movie. of time. its so Hilarious and I've already watched this moving three times since I got it.
B003TGUSHM|5.0|Fantastic story and cinematography.  All the characters are excellent, be sure to watch in HD to get the best experience.
0385350864|5.0|This was the perfect story for the imperfect life of Bridget. Well written to the point. Glad the Helen Fielding, wrote the diary where Bridget's life just started to get exciting again. If you are a fan of Bridget when you were in your 30's you will be a fan and a cheerleader to where she is at today.
B00C1BTWV4|2.0|I LOVED this movie when I was 10.  I recently watched it as an adult and it just wasn't the same.  The problems that this movie has is the acting and directing are terrible.  Steven Spielberg's direction of the actors is absolutely terrible.  The close-ups of Dr. Grant's face, Jeff Goldblum throughout the movie, and the kids just plain suck.  Steven Spielberg is just a pop director.  The actual story is good and the special effects were amazing for the time, but the acting and directing darn near ruin it.
B00ARN0ZF0|3.0|The movie is good for lounging around on your off days....my impression on the parents was simple,&#34;clueless&#34; that poor teen had to endure some crazy incidents but overall I will follow this series til they resolve the possession of the aunt and little boy.I like all the crazy hauntings this movie put out.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|This a very clever app for learning tbe basicsof music. It's very easy to use. It also provides the sounds of different instruments including that of a choir. The selection of well-known pieces of music to learn makes it fun. If you're singing you can use it to find the right note.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Fun, graphics are great and multiplayer is really cool. Has a good story and with the new update it is better
B0036TGT2A|4.0|After being slightly disappointed with the effects on the Blu-ray release of Beauty and the Beast, I was skeptical on how this movie would look in 3D.  I was happy to be proven wrong. The movie has always been a personal favorite and the effects really brought a fresh take to the film that made me feel like I was experiencing it for the first time. The underwater setting really benefits from the jump to 3D, reminding me most of Finding Nemo (one of my favorite 3D releases). The extra dimension really helped to show detail in the drawings that I had never noticed before, in the 20+ years of regular viewing and I applaud the effort that it must have taken to make the effect as seamless as it is.<br /><br />The HD transfer of the movie is gorgeous, and the only complaint I have is that there are several scenes that seem to be altered or changed, most notably during &#34;Part of Your World&#34;. Disney released a statement, claiming that there was an oversight during the remastering process that caused Ariel to be out of sync with the music. If you own the 2D blu-ray or DVD release, you can contact Disney for a replacment but, at present time, it doesn't appear that they are able to replace the 3D version. In all fairness, the error in question only lasts for a few seconds and shouldn't deter you from purchasing the movie; it just might be a little jarring for a moment. Aside from that minor gripe, this is still the classic movie you remember and love and it honestly has never looked better than it has on this release.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|Great listening device. I wanted to listen to wildlife night sounds from the car while sitting quietly and listening to outside sounds.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was awful.  I had no idea what it was about, but the sex scenes are amateurish and the use of text messaging as a form of dialogue is simply stupid!  Really?
1576754227|5.0|I have found this book to be very helpful in prioritizing my work day.  The book contains pratical tools for identifying what really needs to get done, and then ranking those tasks in order to make sure you are not spending precious time on tasks that do not add value.  How many of us have wasted time completing projects that did not make the impact we thought they would?  By following the guidance provided in Eat That Frog! you can virtually eliminate that wasted time and effort.  I now use it in training to help others get more of the right things done.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Loved the movie.  Enjoyed the added scenes.  Happy to spend hours in Middle Earth.  VERY interesting to watch the special features.  It is uplifting to watch people doing what they love to do, i.e. make and create to the absolute best of their ability.
B008JFURII|1.0|Red 2 Stinks<br />Stupid beyond belief!  Bruce Willis should know when it's over but apparently doesn't.  If you like cartoons, Bugs Bunny reruns are more entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing how did Suzanne com up with that I'm so loving these books their awsome I loved the hunger games
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|In spite of the awful acting by Jessica Chastain (who was nominated for Best Actress for this picture) this was a very interesting movie. I really thought her acting was awful but the movie was interesting enough to get by her awful performance.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is a book filled with lovely, magical words. These words evoke imaginings of tolerance, love, compassion and hope. I look forward to reading the next book in this trilogy
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Middle, Max, HAns, Mamma and the rest will be a part of who you are forever forward. The hard and the soft of it like breathing.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game and I really like it a lot especially with the great graphics. Very fun game to play
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It was fun to read books on my phone but I much prefer the Kindle I have now as I got very sore eyes from the background.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|My son is really into gaming and wanted me to be able to play board or card games with him when he can't play with his regular group.  The first two board games were more than I wanted to attempt...what I would consider for hard-core gamers (even though he might somewhat disagree but, hey, I'm his mom so I have final say!).  He has since found two board games and Love Letter, all of which is now a part of &#34;game night&#34;.  If we don't play anything else, which we usually do, we always play Love Letter. I LOVE IT!  No 40-page book of rules  -- just fun, quick and a funny game to play (some might I say, bonehead, play one of us makes or a trick of luck will usually crack us up...okay, yes, it's me who makes the bonehead plays but nevertheless...) and its beautifully illustrated.  The best $10 purchase ever.  It has truly delivered more bang for the buck and I highly recommend it for gamers at all levels.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|The game loaded onto my phone but would not play, so it was a big waste of time for me.
B000KADH2S|2.0|The book did not match the image, and it was falling apart. It is not something I could really read.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Nice game. Objects could be a bit bigger though. Otherwise no complaints and the rewards are decent. I could wile away the hours playing.
B00DHBOQMM|5.0|As always a thoroughly researched novel and compelling reading at times. It will have you sitting in the edge of your seat drawing the sinuous leads together and revelling as you nailed them. Well enjoyed
0792839730|5.0|This movie is a classic that I remember from my childhood days.  I read the original book by Cornelius Ryan and I have to say that this movie does a pretty good job of reflecting Ryan's account.  You'll be shocked at the sheer number of high profile movie stars in this movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys make the best music!  The songs on this album are fantastic choices for their styles and skills.  My husband and I listen to this album all the time especially while driving somewhere.
0767919408|5.0|Bryson wittily and colourfully depicts the many events of that remarkable year of 1927. Many of the incidents were new to me, such as the great Mississippi flood and the trial of Ruth Synder. Perhaps Bryson's best work yet.
B000002J5K|5.0|Great old sound-tracks. Will live on for ever. Very clever and a good laugh. Fit for all age brackets. five stars
0393338827|5.0|Great read....I had to read this for an ethics in accounting class, but I recommend it to anyone.  Gives a very clear explanation of what happened when the housing bubble burst in the late 2000's.  You might want to read up on this subject since one editorialist at the Wll Street Journal thinks we are heading in the exact same direction again...
B000005B0U|5.0|Paul Shaffer is great in this 'Good ole Time Foot stomping Music. A couple of great actor comics. A Family film.
B0087IT8LO|4.0|I have seen the movie before and really like it. Be aware, it has English subtitles only! I did not notice and was vey surprised, when I had to watch it in French. It still is a very good movie.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Well worth my money. I would recommend this season. Can't wait for next season. Have no problems with connection speed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of the most wonderful apps I have ever installed . Here are the powerups .<br />Mega Minion ( you're a giant )<br />Minion Shield<br />Gru s Rocket<br />Fluffy Unicorn ( ride Fluffy )<br />Freeze Ray ( freeze and smash obstacles )
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|They suck you in at the first tier but then the time, game credits and game cash requirements are so high that it would take months just to progress...unless of course you spend $0.99 here, $0.99 there, $4.99 here, etc., etc.  Ridiculous nickel and diming, money grab game to the point of frustration.<br />Uninstalled after tier 1.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Maybe okay for a TV series but I found it slow reading. I stopped reading after a few hundred pages.
0345803507|2.0|The writing was soap operatic and insipid. It was thinly disguised- and poorly written porno.I never even finished the first volume.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me minion rush is awesome and is around the same as temple run I love both of the games
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Love the CD especially 9min Runaway my husband also favors it too Will probably get more of Kanye West. very good stuff!
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|&#34;AM&#34; is another great Arctic Monkeys release!  If you like the band's other releases and can appreciate that each release is different from the last and that is part of what makes this band so great, you will love this CD, too.  Don't listen to the bad reviews - every Arctic Monkeys release gets the same treatment from reviewers:  &#34;it is different&#34;; &#34;it is not Favourite Worst Nightmare Part 2&#34;; &#34;all of the songs sound the same&#34;; and on and on.  I would like to address the main complaints of reviewers giving poor reviews:<br />  1.  Yes, it is different.  If you haven't figured it out yet, I'll explain:  Arctic Monkeys is a band that evolves and continually challenges<br />  itself not just do the same, old things it has done in the past.<br />  2.  No, it is not Nightmare Part 2.  Neither was Humbug and neither was Suck it.  Get used to it - the next one won't be either.<br />  3.  It does have a commonality to the general vibe of the songs - but most CDs by most bands do.  &#34;AM&#34; has a really COOL vibe.<br />  Just sit back and enjoy it.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|I was excited when this game updated....now it won't open...and I paid for this game and I rarely do that...I am very disappointed...
B0035OC830|4.0|Hilarious ex-patriate's view of American excesses of consumption! A journey back to child hood nostalgia turned self-deprecation and scathing criticism of current day Americans and their bad habits en-masse. Most Americans will either hate,it, wont get it or squirm with embarrassment!
B003XURDAY|4.0|This DVD is a classic SciFi action plot about what evolved robots competing with mankind.<br />The plot was very suspenseful and there is a freshness to this kind of story plot.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Best book ever!  I read it regularly!<br />I have owned 3 copies that pages are falling out of so it was time to get a Kindle version.  Cant loose pages from that  ; )
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I ordered this and the Kindle Fire power cord for my Kindle Fire, when I recieved it it would not charge my Kindle at all I tried using different configerations of the cords and chargers (including my IPOD USB Plug) and the IPOD plug seems to be the only thing that charges my Kindle, this works great for my cell phone, but Amazon really needs to figure out a reliable charging system for the Kindle.
0800141849|5.0|Excellent movie. It has an amazing story line that is easily relatable to every woman out there. We as women often feel less than even if we aren't, and this movie really shows how easy it is for us to fall into that pattern.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|Strange, but not enough plot and too much sarcasm.  This does not live up to the Bond legacy of being a great action film with an even better plot.  My advice, skip it unless all you want to see is great visual effects.  One think I did like was the motorcycle chase.  Excellent riding!
B000002KOJ|5.0|Joni at her finest!  Pure voice, deep lyrics and a must for anyone's vocal artists collection.  This album is at the very beginning of her career and sets the foundation of her later work.  Plus her art work is wonderful to gaze at while listening.
B00EJOCAYW|1.0|The prices on here are ridiculous. They are cheaper on the actual lego website. Why would I pay $64 for one set and I can get 2 for that price?! Get it together.
B00FVZJYK6|1.0|Despicable Amazon.    What's with all the $14.99 buy it now stuff? It's a kids movie for crissakes! Are you all THAT greedy?    ** UPDATE **    BTW, when I finally got to see it, the movie itself wasn't bad.
B007PJFFWC|4.0|Very enjoyable, feel-good, fantasy movie, with just a touch of darkness. Great characters, actors, and story-telling. I would recommend highly!
B00A2H9PLG|4.0|I've seen this and Olympus Has Fallen, but personally enjoyed this more. Olympus Has Fallen is a great movie, but White House Down was more entertaining.<br /><br />White House Down has lots of great action, good serious moments, and some humor. Channing and Jamie both did great. The other actors in this film also did good. There were many WOW moments in this film, which I enjoyed. If you like action movies and have a sense of humor, then definitely check this one out!
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|It does what it's supposed to do: charging android/iphone in my car. The charging is bit slow but the design is sleek!
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|I was very satisfied with the high quality of this wax.  Nice heavy disc and solid sound!  Classic soundtrack from the Don of the synthesizer.. Vangelis.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The game is amazing for mobile. It has the long range of characters and  booster packs. It's easy to play and entertains for a while.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing playing this game. I'll spend hours in it, I play it almost every day. Def my fav game
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I got this gadget mostly for tracking my sleep, but right now I probably use activity tracking mostly.<br /><br />Activity tracking feature is really useful, and it's fun tracking how much steps you walked today or how many meters you climbed. It also helps with mapping the city you live in (it's x steps or x km from here to there). Even if I'm staying at home whole day working it's good to know how many steps I end up taking in my flat (minimal activity so to say). The application also displays activity in periods so it's easy to check when you were most active.<br /><br />It also has a burned calories tracker, but I'm not using it.<br /><br />The sleep tracker is also helpful, but the collected data should be taken with a grain of salt (not the Withings problem, more like a problem of sleep tracking technology in general). It's really great to see that the &#34;floating&#34; feeling was actually a move to a light sleep, or what was your sleep pattern because you feel great today. The problem is that in my opinion the data is not always correct, because it shows that I felt asleep in 30 minutes, then I definitely know at an hour mark I was still awake. Still good to be able to see your sleep pattern and do some testing. The application could provide some more functionality for sleep tracking, like adding comments for easier experimentation.<br /><br />The BMP taking is completely useless. I haven't tested it with the real equipment, but I'm 99% sure the readings are incorrect most of the time. I just simple can't believe that after exercising when your heart is trying to jump out from your chest my BMP is the one you would have in relax mode, and the other way around. Of course this is the problem only if you're able to take a reading of your BMP. After the fifth time of trying to take a reading I decided to never use this feature again.<br /><br />The clock is also a nice feature.<br /><br />The device is really small so it doesn't get in the way. I simply just throw it in my pocket and forget about it. The clip is actually useless for me, because to me it looks like it would be a great way to lose your tracker and I would rather just throw it in my pocket. The bracelet feels quite nice on the skin, and you forget you are wearing it so I use it then I go to sleep or for a walk in the city. Just not sure it would survive a lot of stress so if you're going to do something really active it's better probably to put it in your pocket.<br /><br />The application for checking collected data isn't bad but could be more useful. Something else I dislike is having to use an Android (or iOS) application to sync the data, it would be nice to have the ability to sync it using my laptop without having to install applications you won't use (I just check everything in the web).row it in my pocket and forget about it.

Something else I dislike is having to use an Android (or iOS) application to sync the data, it would be nice to have the ability to sync it using my laptop without having to install applications you won't use (I just check everything in the web).
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It gets the job done, I can watch any youtube video on this and anything on netflix and its pretty fast. Also you can project whatever tab if open on Chrome on there so basically anything you can find on the internet to watch, you can watch it on your TV with the chromecast. And I have a MacBook not a Windows PC and it works perfectly fine!
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Not the best movie you'll ever see. Pretty cheesy at times, mostly predictable until maybe the very end. Character development is pretty basic. It was okay, didn't love it, didn't hate it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is fun and offers great learning. Lots of neat ways to create new and exciti ng pets. It available for free.
0399230033|5.0|This is a wonderful picture book.  All my grandchildren have loved this book when they were very young.  It is alot of fun to share with them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game, can definitely get addicting. I haven't had any glitches so far, it runs pretty smooth. Love that it's available on my kindle fire hd. Fun way to pass time!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like the mini games. My daughter loves having a game that lets her play with some ofbher favorite characters from her favorite show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses, always have. I found the game fun a and entertaining, and it brought back my childhood wish to get a horse for Christmas.
0793563836|5.0|I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE ADVANCE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO READ YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS IT IS SO SIMPLE AND EASY TO LEARN!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it took me a while to finally try this but I'm totally hooked. so much fun! like jewel quest but 100 times better!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally this game has come to kindle! This game is super addicting it features bejewled styled play where you switch candies into groups of at least three like candies. This is a great game for kids, but be aware that it can connect to Facebook and ha  in app purchasing. Something I really like though is that it can be played even when I'm not connected to WiFi. The app will sync your progress next time you are connected to WiFi. Over all wonderful app.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|great game worth the 5 bucks I spent on it and it hasn't glitched on me yet and I doubt it will.
B003YUF0GC|4.0|does exactly what i needed it to do<br /><br />works very well<br /><br />use it with my laptop for turn by turn
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had heard a great deal about this game and couldn't wait to try it.  Very pleased that it is a challenge.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham's books are always a good read.  It started to get rather slow in the middle and it was not as exciting as some of his others. but I still enjoyed it.  If you're a Grisham fan you will too.
0307950654|1.0|Very disappointing!  It is diffficult say anything positive about the book.  It had potemtial, but fizzled out soon after I began reading.  I plodded along hoping it would pick-up - but it didn't.  I always give a book 100 pages- I'm sorry I gave this book 10 pages.
B00081912E|5.0|Omg this classic I had to grab it and for 5 dollars you can't beat that at all. I love this movie growing up and I ordered it and got it on time so I commend amazon they continue to amaze .not one piece of product that I've been disappointed with.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I am stuck on level 440 on the Kindle version whereas on my droid phone I am able to play way beyond that level.  Therefore I cannot play on my Kindle until the developers update this version like they have for other devices.  Disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The book is not at all what it is hyped to be. The writing style is poor. 0 stars was not an option or that would have been my rating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicting you will love it<br /><br />I thought it would be boring but it was the best in the world for a game
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|Ok, so it's the FAOTD so I tried it. SO GLAD I DID.Very fun, very addicting, very different &amp; very good! Thanks Devs, great job
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun game easy to play. Great for young kids to play. My three year old loves the colors and the dragons.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|The sound quality of this headphone amp is wonderful. It powers any type of headphones from the 16 ohm to the 300 ohm range perfectly, and the EQ options work as expected. It's tiny enough to carry around, and if you're looking for a size, it's about a 1.5 by 1.5 inch square. The amp doesn't pick up electronic interference at all, and the volume options have very good precision, it increments by a 64th each time.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is just what is needed for the new book writer who wants to publish on Kindle!  It gives detailed instructions on each step of the process to provide the best possible success for your creation.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Shakespeare for our times. I love it when an articulate writer lets her imagination take wing. For a first novel, too, just amazing. Got it in one, Ms Morgenstern. More, please!
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Ugh. If you have a need for moody acting and an abundance of CGI then this movie is for you. If you wanted intelligent story telling with the story as the star, skip it.
B000OIZUW6|2.0|I bought this book after having read &#34;Eye of the Needle,&#34; which I thought was excellent.  &#34;Jackdaws&#34; falls far short of the standard set by &#34;Needle,&#34; IMO.  A couple of the characters act like complete idiots (especially when Nazi bigwigs are around).  Some of the other characters are well-developed, but I just couldn't get past my disgust at the stupidity that was displayed by some of the minor characters early in the book.  Not because their actions were stupid, but because it was completely unbelievable to me that any real person would behave the way they did.
1476727651|4.0|It's been a long time since I read a Stephen King book & this one did not disappoint.  I've seen the movie The Shining, but haven't read the book.  No matter.  You can read Doctor Sleep without having read The Shining.  This is a typical Stephen King book - well developed characters, most of the action happens at the end, over 500 pages.  I couldn't put this book down & read it a lot faster than I expected to.  If you've read Stephen King, then you know how scary he can be.  This book isn't that.  It's a page turner without making you sleep with the light on.  Highly recommend.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this book.  The end was not formula fiction, but different.  For me, when the book was over, I was affected.  It bothered me.  I thought about it for days.  I kept remembering that life isn't perfect and this would be how the real world would treat a story.  The movie, Divergent, isn't out yet, but there's no way a film can duplicate this series of books.  They never do.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This is a funny movie with an enjoyable cast. This is both a comedy and an action, in the best way.  It definitely will make you laugh!
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I have Flipboard on my old iPad and it works flawlessly. It was one of the first Apps I downloaded for my Kindle Fire HDX. Unfortunately it isn't so flawless on the Fire. Many times when you click on a item where you want to read the whole story it does the little \\"loading\\" but when it is done you have the headline and a blank page with no content. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I finally figured out what was wrong with this App. Apparently it only works correctly in portrait mode. This must be a \\"quirk\\" of Android since I have the same problem with another App I have. It really is silly that the App will only work in one orientation. Maybe the developer should force the App to open in portrait mode if that is the only way it works.<br /><br />I have removed the App now. I was reading something on Grantland and a ESPN ad was accidentally opened when I was trying to turn the page. I could not back out of a download the ESPN App screen so the App was going to force me to download Watch ESPN which I didn't want to do. So goodbye Flipboard.
B00CL151G4|5.0|This is a fabulous modern take on Sherlock Holmes.  I got it because I knew my husband would like it, but honestly I adored it as well.  The characters are fabulous. Lucy L does an awesome job as Watson!  The crime aspect is fairly typical, but with the Holmes' logic applied.  The characters are what makes this awesome!
1578152429|5.0|Anna Massey is always superb. I'll listen to anything she records.  they sould put her on an MP3 CD for even better listening pleasure.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love Facebook. Social media is the way of the future. Facebook was the first outlet and is the leader. Great.
630542845X|5.0|powerful, this is perfect for recharge your hearth, and your feelings, life is the best, i cry and i feel more human.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game! so fun to play &amp; love all of the levels! there is not a better game out there!
B006C45CFG|4.0|THE MOVIE IS PRETTY GOOD. IT WILL KEEP YOU INTERESTED. THERE IS SOME SLOW TIMES. BUT, ALL IN ALL NOT A BAD MOVIE.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Liked Time to Kill so interested in the continuing story of Jake Brigance. I liked the story but not as riveting as Time to Kill. Great characters returned like Lucien and Ozzie. The story of the will and the outcome of the jury decision was a little predictable so only 4 stars. Enjoyable read.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|You can never go wrong with a QT movie!  I loved the way the story pieced together.  Will watch again and again.  Sid
B000XUBFE2|5.0|World war 2 from a young girls point of view. Germany,a young girl has lost her mother and brother. She is not Jewish but German. This book takes you to a modest street and tells you about neighbors and day to day life. It is told by an angel who gathers souls and takes them to heaven. Have a Kleenex handy and prepare to not put it down until you are finished
B0013ND30M|5.0|I got it for me daughters birthday came all scratched no ones fault loose in DVD box! They replaced it, no questions ask or proof Thank you so much! We are now enjoying the movie with granddaughter who got to share mom's day their birthdays are the same day! How cool is that to bring out the old movies and enjoy them again!
B00DJWV11I|4.0|Loved this book! Loved the male POV.  Made me laugh all night reading it.  Would (and have) recommend to others.  If you are debating... Buy it!!!<br /><br />I'm not usually a fan of the male POV in a romance novel but is was done perfectly.  I will buy more from this author.  Worth every penny.  Warning:  be careful reading this in public... You will look like a dork from all the laughing you will be doing!
B000055Y0X|5.0|It is the absolute best of the rendition of the subject.  Anti-A war.  But what the hell, a little population/ethnic cleansing can't be all bad.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. it'd great gorgon the go fun and justt tpbll keepbyou entrrtained I drfinately reccomend this game
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Extended Edition with Limited Edition...<br />Good paking great movie and great image cuality and good figure.<br />Fast shipment.
B006VP1OYO|5.0|Noisy, loud, and full of different sounds I wouldn't think to get out of a guitar, these EPs really have some great My Bloody Valentine. It has everything from the Isn't Anything and Loveless years and it really shows here. This is a must have if you love My Bloody Valentine.
031623480X|5.0|This is a very enlightening book about what grain can do to our bodies.  Everyone should have this information to enable them to choose to live a healthier lifestyle.  We have followed the advice from this book and others like it and it definitely makes a difference in our lives for the better.
B00G2KV92U|1.0|Just plain terrible! This sounds like a garage band with no passion left to rock and roll. It's officially time for Boston to change careers.
B00BATG18K|4.0|I really got into this story. It was hard for me to put down. I loved all of her main characters. Very heartwarming.
B00FKQ38OE|5.0|Love this one. Great variety of songs and Paul's lyrics always resonate with me even though I'm young enough to be one of his kids.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Everyone likes playing temple run 2 more than the original one. We spend plenty (to much) time playing this.  : - )
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Good Game as far as the process though. but you're given all the main quests at the start and it can get very confusing. Shards are to hard to stack up though.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|The kids love playing this and any of the angry bird games. It plays past time when there's nothing else to do.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Interesting game so far. Different from what I'm use to. Only complaint so far is right before u go to a puzzle a message appears on the screen, but it flashes way to fast for me to read it.  I can't read it and once in awhile one will stay long enough for me to read. They apparently are hints which is great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  It really makes you plan ahead to the next move.  When you move to the next level it is a great feeling.  However some levels are so frustrating,  half way thru you have no moves to win and you know it.  Boo
B008JFUPK8|5.0|How can you not like Superman. But really the movie fast forwards really quick and gives us a different point of view for Superman's beginning.  Kevin Costner was only in the movie for a short time. I do recommend watching the movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is about love war death and the injustice and sorrow of the world.<br />A rather depressing combination, however, there is some ray of hope in the love between father and daughter, mother and child, and a forlorn German Jewish refugee harbored by a German family in WW2.<br />There is also a touching account of a young German boy and girl growing up in Munich during the war stealing apples and their deep friendship.<br />The book is narrated by Death.<br />He turns out to be the grim but somewhat compassionate reaper/author narrator of the story.<br />This is a very moving tale.<br />Liesel Memminger, the book thief, is a true tragic heroine.
1451666179|5.0|This book is fantastic.  Set up like her blog that I love too.  I absolutely recommend this fantastic read.  So happy that I saw on NPR that this had been released
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game has adventure action and you get to travel the best part is that you get to play with your friends and make cool swords
B00FR3UZ8C|5.0|Bocelli is anyways great!!! This albulm is another one of his great works. I recommend to anyone who likes Bocelli.
030758836X|4.0|This is a difficult book to review because I liked the story but I despised the characters.  Nick and Amy are so detestable in both their personalities and their actions, especially how they capitulate at the end.  Nick acknowledges that he comes off as ridiculous in his eagerness to please.  His desperation to make everyone like him is pathetic.  Amy is calculating, manipulative, and deplorable.  And both of them spew nothing but lies, so they make for the most unreliable narrators in the history of modern fiction.  I will give Flynn credit for keeping me guessing.  The plot was well-paced and captivating enough to keep me engrossed in the twisted schemes of Amy and the dishonest antics of Nick.  I suppose Flynn wouldn't have been able to write such a riveting novel without having such a-holes screwing things up so bad.  Overall it was a fun read with characters I loved to hate.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Another page turner. You never know where the next  page takes you. Love it! Can not wait for their next book.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one I have been reading the series for a long time and it is the best.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|Only 2/50 pictures were bad out of case. That's reasonable. I've bought ammo worse than that. HQ film for a fraction of the cost in the store to use with your mini polaroid.
B00DNB9RXO|4.0|This is definitely new and interesting. Crashed a couple of times after installing, but played to level 11 without a crash again.<br /><br />A little more help would have been nice, but what I've figured out so far is:<br /><br />If it's moving, it will probably kill you.<br />If it looks pointy, it will probably kill you.<br /><br />So... get ready to die... A lot!<br /><br />Another minor complaint is that I have to pick my control scheme every level.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|One of the more addictive mobile games.  Well executed and lots of fun.  Challenging enough to keep you interested but not over the top difficult.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I enjoyed reading it. It was hard to keep up at times with the story it was a lot of  back and forth
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Most of the time the camera function doesn't work or gives the message that it has stopped working.  Why the Kindle didn't come with a working camera, I'll never know!  Bad call Kindle!
1892005034|3.0|I like the basic information in this book, but found the wording a little trite. I think it says some very useful stuff, and is certainly worth reading, but I really wish the examples were more realistic and less contrived. If someone were to talk to me - like the author is recommending that we talk to people - when I am upset, I think it would make me more mad, because it sounds so fake. But, at the same time, the advice is GOOD advice... I recommend that people read the book, but take the principles to heart and make it real for yourself.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to use and alot of fun.  Pandora was just added and makes it better.  It looks like google is working to port more media streams in which only make it more valuble.
0812550706|5.0|I love this series, which was written back in the 70's, I believe, but shows a great deal of acuracy as far as the progression of technology! When the iPad was first announced it reminded me so much of the &#34;desks&#34; that are referred to in the first book. These books evolve nicely and are a very good read.
6305736650|5.0|Best Movie ever.  Who doesn't love a classic and this one is easy to watch.  Classic love story and the famous runway scene
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like anyone who's seen this series, I am a Firefly fan! They shouldn't have cancelled the series, as it had truly witty dialog, great character development throughout the series, and was an ingenious premise - Space Cowboys at their best!
B000VI12ZS|3.0|Very interesting movie.  Every American should know the contribution made by these Apache patriots during WW II.  The movie itself was well acted if not extraordinary.  Viewing this movie is well worthwhile.
B003G4W49C|2.0|I know this is considered a classic, but I found it ridiculous. Children? REALLY?! I must be missing the necessary muscle to buy it.
0380018179|5.0|i rarely leave reviews but this is one of the best books i have ever read. my high school marching band teacher got me hooked on the theme song over 20 years ago so I read the book last year. thank's mr. berry!
B002VWONB2|5.0|Best overall film ever, even after considering Citizen Kane, Gone With The Wind or Forest Gump. And  although fictional, encapsulates many true events that actually took place during that horrible history.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautiful!  What a magnificent illustration of the effects of one life. We are all so intricately intertwined. Thank you Mr. Hosseini!
B000AGTPUK|4.0|i wish this movie matched the book more closely. i loved the book growing up, but the movie added scenes to extend the movie time.
B00129H7VS|5.0|There is only one word to say about this set. Awesome! Great blue ray set of The DVD set of the Band of Brothers.
0395389496|5.0|i loved this book growning up and every christmas it was a tradition to read this book. now my son loves trains, but i forgot how wordy this book is. it really isn't bad, but too many words to keep the attention of a 2 year old.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I love these types of games. I despise the time restrictions present though. You only get so many lives then you must wait hours or days to regain hem to play again. Very frustrating.
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|The animation, sound, and voice acting of this series is nothing short of spectacular. I'd recommend this to Star Wars fans of all ages, and those who simply appreciate great storytelling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it really should play it when have the time super fun and addictive I hate when you die when you are so close to beating your high score tho! #amazing
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I did figure it out, but enjoyed the journey anyway.  Mr. Grisham knows how to keep me turning the pages.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Inventive weaving tog of reality,mysticism,Bhuddism,philosophy,quantum physics into a tale of time & being--defining moments that seemingly impact life forces,events thru time & space.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|week plot so its not up to James Bond standards but it was watchable. Just ok. No the greatest bond flick
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Another outstanding book by Gladwell. Not all the stories are about a David taking on a Goliath. The story about class size and student performance is not really in the David and Goliath mold. The message is about overcoming monstrous difficulties or hardships on the path to some form of success. While the odds may seem stacked against you, you may find a hidden strength within you, and/or a trait/weakness in the thing that opposes you, which you can leverage.<br /><br />So don't be afraid to take on a powerful entity. Don't hesitate because the obstacles are intimidating, or you've had some major misfortune in life. You just may have precisely what is needed to succeed.<br /><br />I wish the book were about 100 pages longer. When finished, I found myself hoping there were more stories. I'll just have to wait for the next one.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Fun and enjoying game.  Good for most ages!!  It's the first time that I have played a game like this.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|great acting! so well done.  fascinating characters.  and christine baranski not only looks fabulous and wears awesome clothes, but she plays a law firm founder so very well.
0684824906|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read.  It gives amazing insight to the Lincoln era.  I could not put it down but did not want the book to end.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive! I have downloaded this app on my tablet, my computer and on my phone. I find myself playing any time i have a free moment
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I read this book in a single afternoon.  The pace is fast and the story captivating.  The authors does a fantastic job slowly developing the characters, keeping a little bit of mystery just were it is needed.  Can't wait for the next installment.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|They are some of the most talented musicians and their zest for songs is infectious. I never come away from hearing one of their songs without feeling like my day is just that much better. I can't recommend this album highly enough for anyone looking for feel-good instrumental Christmas tunes.
B00H2UFHBI|5.0|This trilogy is absolutely fantastic! As you follow Nate, the protagonist, on his quest to discover secrets of the past and avoid Lightyear, you will be immersed into an exciting and thrilling adventure: there's time travel, loss of friends, decisions that can make a difference between life and death, love, and action-packed scenes. All those elements add up to fantastic books, but that's what's visible on the surface, on the level of plot.<br /><br />These books are much deeper than the surface plot as they books make the readers think about many philosophical concepts but present them in a very accessible way. One such concept is that of awareness. Brandt Legg makes us question our own lives and consider how aware we really are of our surroundings, of others, and of ourselves - and that's a great issue to ponder for a person of any age, teenagers included. Many ideas in his books and the eloquent way that the author expresses them feel like pearls of ancient wisdom in the modern world, and that's incredibly appealing.<br /><br />The nature of creativity, spiritual understanding of the world, material advancement vs. preservation of old traditions, reincarnation, free will, the nature of fear and overcoming fear to reach goals - all these are issues that Nate has to deal with as he pursues his quest. As a reader, you will be right there with him, and you will emerge a wiser person.<br /><br />I adore Brandt Legg's use of language. He is a writer and a photographer, so his keen power of observation doesn't come as a surprise. But it still delights. The language is precise and descriptive without being overly wordy. Here are just a couple of my favorite phrases: &#34;the jumble of yellow cabs&#34; (in Manhattan), &#34;the joys of Dreams Lake helped disperse the morning's traumas,&#34; or &#34;time was attacking us from many sides.&#34;<br /><br />What I love about Brandt Legg's books is the deeper level of thinking and deeper issues that he invites us to explore, all in a very easy-to-read and entertaining way. &#34;What if?&#34; and other hypothetical questions are always fun ones to ponder, and you will have plenty of opportunities to do that when you read his books. What are the best ways to drive innovation? What societal structures are most conducive to innovative thinking? How does money affect societies? What could the alchemists really accomplish? And why didn't JP Morgan board the Titanic, like he was supposed to? And this is just a quick little sampling of the kinds of things this trilogy will make you think about. What a fantastic journey! Highly recommended.in a very easy-to-read and entertaining way. &#34;What if?&#34; and other hypothetical questions are always fun ones to ponder, and you will have plenty of opportunities to do that when you read his books.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is so colorful and has great graphics. I would definitely recommend this app. It is also really fun I just think that they should give you more pearls. I totally love this app. So get this amazing app.(P.S it never glitches!)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|best value ever.  I do wish i could stream from software other than chrome.  Google has gone to great lengths to make sure this is not possible.  You can always use handbrake to encode your movies as mp4 so the audio and video codec works in chrome.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This app is very helpful and resourceful I just wish that you could put passwords on your notebooks so nobody can open them.

034553056X|4.0|Despite being an avid reader, I have never been able to get past the first chapter of a John Grisham novel. I was a bit reluctant to read The Litigators, but all I heard were amazing reviews. I finally(after having to wait on a list) was able to borrow it from my local library.<br />The first chapter, I was hooked. I could see Wally Figg as Danny Devito! While reading this book I felt like I was on a roller coaster, one minute I was loving the characters and the next minute I wanted to slap them. How could you not have a love-hate relationship with Oscar and Wally? As far as the ending goes...I didn't see that coming. I never could get an idea on how the book was going to end. I love books like that, I don't want to guess how the book ends and then find out I guessed right.<br />However, I can't give this book 5 stars because I often felt lost reading all the legal dialect. I'm not used to reading books from the lawyer's point of view. A must read though! John Grisham has a new fan!
B00EZ43PJA|1.0|This retails for 34.99! It is not worth MORE.  Clearly this is the Tickle-Me Elmo of the season.  Just going to wait.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  I have no legs and this game give me a lot of ways to occupy my mind.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is now our primary way of watching movies and TV, easy to use and affordable. You can control it from either your phone, tablet or your computer.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I think this book was great. I could read this over and over again. It's a great book it's awesome
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Updated all devices today and all show error codes when trying to connect (aneroid phone &amp; kindle fire).  Wi-fi connection works great...using it to post this review.  Love this game but update stinks. Will be moving on to other games now.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is just a wonderful book, well deserving of its reputation and cult-like following. I enjoyed it so much thatI read all the rest of the series, a total of 7 books that are all equally enchanting.
B00009NQQO|4.0|Fun toy and we used this a lot. We wound up storing a lot of tub toys in this for our son. I also had one for my daughter. It doesn't rip or fall apart and it stays on the  tile perfectly. Good buy.
B000URWYTS|4.0|The book was interesting and well-written. Even though the characters did not always behave nicely, the author made me sympathize with them. The connection with Frank Lloyd Wright was intriguing.
B005MJ883K|4.0|My nephews loved this toy. The older one figured it out in like an hour, but the youngers ones did not. Very fun to play with.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|Just fit my Nikon D7100 very well. Even though I am a freshmen for taking photograph, but it can help me a lot!
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Great Series.  Not for everyone but I like it.  Nice to see all toghter and not having to wait until next week to see the next episode.
B0087FMUCQ|2.0|If you want to flick the ball like a driving range shot, and control it with unrealistic physics, download this<br /><br />I want to play a game of golf
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row is the best courtroom drama I've read in a very long time.  It is an incredibly complex, interesting and includes some ugly history in the telling of the story.  Highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys a dramatic story of a man who commits suicide and the story of the past and the present as a result of his death.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I love this book sooo much its mot even funny you have to read this best series ever first book is matched though
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Riveting...the prose that Gilbert is known for keeps you reading page after page. The passion of life in flora and fauna is a brilliant metaphor for human passion....bare survival  to triumph.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|Great classic movie, everything about the movie is funny.  Highly recommend to anyone who hasn't seen this one, it was seriously underrated when at the theaters.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Had no intention of reading this or seeing the movies BUT on Black Friday my sister wanted to go see the second movie and she was paying so I agreed to see the movie. Great, by the way! So I came home and got the book series. Very much the modern 1984.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So far I've only used my Chromecast for Netflix and it seems harder to use for other things the way my house is set up, but it works great for Netflix. I got it with the free 2 months of Netflix and it made an already inexpensive dongle much cheaper.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is good but the wait on power is a little bit long. maybe you could add some building that makes it faster.
B007V4530A|5.0|This is a nice book that is full of helpful tips. I've done a lot of public speaking, for most of my adult life (including at TEDx events) but still found it valuable and helpful. Some of it was a nice refresher, but there were some key points I'd not seen before.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I love this movie.  I've read the book...there are very few movies that are better than the book and in my opinion, this movie is better. I love the characters and I love Judi Dench!
B00ER23V1W|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />As a fan of musical scores for the past 25+ years I am rarely given the pleasure of hearing something new and amazing and it has now happened score-wise again with this genius piece of work by Steven Price.  As I watched the movie Gravity I was immediately blown away by the music and how perfect it was.  I couldn't recognize the work and knew as soon as the movie was over I would have to look up whoever did this amazing job.  Imagine my surprise when I found out it was basically a rookie as film scoring goes.<br /><br />Whoever made the genius decision to hire Mr. Price deserves a promotion as they heard something that said this individual was going to come up with something amazing.  Not just amazing, but unique and SPECIAL.<br /><br />This immediately makes my Top 10 of the greatest film scores i have ever heard in my life.  I salute you Mr. Price for an amazing accomplishment.<br /><br />Standout Tracks:<br /><br />1. Above Earth<br />2. Debris<br />5. Don't Let Go<br />6. Airlock<br />9. Parachute<br />12. Aningaaq<br />13. Soyuz<br />14. Tiangong<br />16. Gravity<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Unique relationship between two individuals who's paths probably never would have crossed had it not been for a terrible accident. The characters are fantastic...all of them. I havent even finished the book and dont know how it will all end up. I just love reading about the evolving situation. Hard to put down.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|Pros<br />-Big<br />-Lots of buttons<br />-R/L click is great<br />-Responsive<br />-Edit: Nearly forgot, cloth covered cable! I really like this!<br /><br />Cons<br />-Almost too Big<br />-Your ring finger and pinky slide a lot, why could they not put the no-slip on the right side of the mouse? My hand sweat a little bit and my fingers move faster than a porsche.<br />-Middle thumb button is kinda rigid and hard to click right.<br /><br />Look, the mouse is good for people who like to rest their hands on the mouse or claw it. Which is me. But it could have been a lot better.<br /><br />Also, minor design quibble: why put the light that can change colors directly where your hand goes? Kinda defeats the purpose no?<br />So TL;DR: Average Mouse. Not great, but not bad at all either.<br /><br />Edit: Customer Support was quite adamant about seeing if they could do anything to fix my qualms with the product. Sadly, as I mentioned above, the mouse works well, I just do not like some of the design features. Nevertheless, they were quite personable and direct in their communications with me, and as you will see in other reviews, they are quite good at doing replacements. So thats a plus. Good on Anker. I hope the next mouse they put out fixes the issues I have because I would love to review this mouse higher than 3 stars.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Always a fun way to pass the time. A simple game and liked the sound effects, especially when you complete the game.
B0082XJGRK|5.0|It is an amazing book written almost 2000 years ago that calls out through the ages.  The only downside is the olde English and I don't mean 40's but the thee, thou etc.
006202406X|1.0|I couldn't put the first two books down, they were so riveting! Allegiant was boring. I hated the dual narrative and the ending was pitiful!! Don't know how an author can write two great books and then totally blow it on the final book!! So disappointed. Read the other two books in a few days. Took me at least a week to finish this one. Kept reading to find out how it ended and then was totally let down by the ending.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|High speed and adds several USB ports for a great price. Highly recommend if you are looking for a quick and cheap expansion of your USB 3.0 ports.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This was definitely a page turner and kept my interest the whole way. Nicely developed characters and story line. About 3/4 of the way through, you can pretty much predict the ending, I wish there would have been a twist that I didn't see coming, but still recommend it.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel Washington pulls this off very well. It makes you wonder how many pilots are flying us around who are not up to par.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|My expectations for this book were low, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the writing was engaging, the plot device of the list worked well, and I found myself really, genuinely rooting for Rose. It's a fun, funny, good-hearted and distinctive read with a touch of romance that helps Rose's character develop in just the right ways.
B005R9HK8O|1.0|COULD NOT DOWN LOAD. AND SO  NOT HAPPY. SIMPLE DO NOT NEED TO GO ON FOR 20 WORDS. SA FGS KKJ OANMJ KMDIUFNM KDFIJUFJN
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is the only one I've kept on my Kindle Fire since I first downloaded it. The story is great, the action exciting and the controls easy -- except the Bat --  and the environments gorgeously rendered.  Only disappointment was the final showdown with Bane, which seems kind of a letdown. However, replay value is high and the game is definitely a keeper.
006202406X|5.0|Very happy with the product.  Arrived as told it would.  My daughter had the book read in less than a week.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I intended to give this book five stars.<br />A deeply emotional book that is written in a format that involves the reader as though they were characters in the story
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|I failed to purchase this on Amazon before it sold out. I was able to purchase it at my local Barnes & Noble store in Los Angeles at The Grove for $228.89 including tax yesterday 12.5.13. They had more in the back room, you just need to ask. I would call ahead to make sure they haven't sold out. I'm rating this 5 Stars for the show and this collectors package. Awesome! One issue I had was with the Ultra Violet digital copies after I redeemed the codes on the Sony UV website not all episodes showed up on my favorite site to watch UV's, Vudu.com. I spoke with vudu.com and they were aware of the issue and it's an issue with Sony and that they are working on and hope to have it fixed by end of day today (12.6.13). I'm not sure if Sony will produce anymore before Christmas, but I would look around at your local Best Buy, Walmart, Target and Barnes & Noble to see if they have any for the $199 price.<br /><br />Update: 12.6.13 6pm: Sony fixed the issue with the UV Digitals on vudu.com
0618680004|5.0|Professor Dawkins does a good job proving his point by showing not only the evident falsehoods of the bible and the quran, but also the amazing lack of evidence for the truth claims of the three monotheaisms.  I would also like to note that chapter two has such invective as has not been seen since Shakespear.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|One of the most astonishing and entertaining theatrical events ever!  It just gets bigger and bigger and better and better. A real &#34;must see.&#34;
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Fluffy light vacation read for those who've grown old with Bridget. Helen Fielding's Bridget encourages us all to remember there's life after 50.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This was a truly AWESOME movie. One of the BEST I have seen for a long time. It soooo vividly demonstrates human strengths AND weaknesses. I WILL definitely recommend others to watch this. WUNDERBAR !
0140177396|5.0|It arrived in much better shape than I thought it would be.  It was rated something like Good or Fair, but it could have easily been rated Very Good (as far as condition goes.)  Pleasantly surprised.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|This was better than the last Pendergast novel, but still not as good as the earlier works in the series.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This does not work with all wireless routers such as Verizon's as they lack Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).  So if your router doesn't support this function, Chromecast will not work with other wireless devices like an IPad or IPhone.  Check your router's tech specs or go to Google's support site to see if your router is compatible.  If not, don't buy this!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Exactly what I needed for my lap-top with only 2 USB ports. I've ordered several Anker products in the last 6 months and found each of them to be well designed and constructed. They seem to produce handy products that are reliable and very useful. When I'm looking for a computer/electronic accessory on Amazon now, I scan for &#34;Anker&#34;.
B00FEHXISA|2.0|This movie is decent at best, RDJ was obviously not wanting to do it.<br />But the money was good and people would go to see it anyway.<br /><br />CG - 6/10<br />Acting - 4/10<br />Story - 7/10<br />Action - 5/10<br /><br />2 stars from me because this movie should have been a lot<br />better.
044655667X|5.0|&#34;The Fifth Witness&#34; is very exciting. I listened to the Audio book and it made my drive so much more exciting. The characters are well developed and you easily get drawn into it. I like how the author is able to pull you into the story. Since the surrounding events are somewhat based on reality and Michael Connelly is very detail oriented, you can easily feel for the characters and about what is at stake. This book is hard to put down. Please also check out my movie, the &#34;Manhattan Dating Project&#34;. Thanks.
B002RVCD0U|3.0|3/5 - This movie has little to no Re watch-ability. If you've never seen it before<br />know that it's vastly better than T3 but if you haven't watched it, rent it. Don't buy it.
B00APUQKDG|2.0|I had high expectations, since I like Robert Pattinson's work and the director but somehow there are not a lot of locations and the story is hard to follow. I also did not like the narration to much. However, there are some beautiful shots. Please check out my movie, &#34;The Manhattan Dating Project&#34;.
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|The Resident Evil series went downhill fast, this was not a good movie in any respect. I saw this<br />TRYING to give it a break because it's Resident Evil. Nothing of a plot, Bad CG, bad acting,<br />and all of the characters just look bored. It was nearly impossible for me to have any positive<br />feelings about this movie. Save your money, go buy something else.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|I actually worked on the movie, so I had high expectations. I like the Acting and the big scenes and images. However I wonder, what would have happened, if the Studio had actually the Director, Marc Forster complete his vision. Since the movie did great at the box office I think it worked and I am thankful that Brad Pitt put so much soul into it. Please check out the &#34;Manhattan Dating Project&#34;, if you get a chance and let me know, what you think, good or bad.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I gave this product a 5/5 because the emotions that they pour into their instruments is insatiable.<br />They love music and love creating music, a quality that is seemingly rare among musicians<br />in this day in age.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Great gift for family friend
B000ICXQOM|5.0|This movie is so hilariously bad that my eyes where glued to the screen the entire time.<br />Bruce Campbell is awesome the fighting scenes are outrageous. So much fake blood.<br />If you really want to have a good time laughing with friends this movie will do it just fine.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The stories are getting too complex and at the same time trivial. The three books that are actually not a sequence but are all about events to different characters during the same time period is confusing.
B005UG542S|2.0|I remember Harry Potter as a teen while reading the book all the way through high school and into adulthood<br />HP has always been one of my favorite books and the first movie was great. It captured the feel of the HP books<br />This movie being the last of a series I watched JUST because it was Harry Potter. The Story is almost gone in this<br />movie, it didn't need to be split into two parts because as much as they cut out it might as well have been one movie.<br /><br />The only thing reminiscent of the books about these movies is the characters.<br /><br />2/5
B00009P1O2|5.0|Amazing, Wow, The is the DVD you want if you like Queen and Freddie. I watch it over, and lend it to my friends, and make sure I get it back.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Great Family movie! My 6 year old daughter loves the minions, and I love the minions! Its always a go to on movie night, never fails to make us laugh.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Such a fantastic story.  Character development was spot on and I was able to reconnect with a beloved character from the Shining.  In fact, I reconnected with quite a few.  The Shining was one of the first King books I read as a tween and to have a sequel of sorts is just the bees knees.  There were some areas where the story lacked a bit of firmness, a few thin spots so to speak.  But an all-around good book that speaks of compassion, moving on, and just trying not to be a d@uche to people around you.  Bravo, Mr. King!!
B00004CYVZ|1.0|I chose this rating because the video I got will not work in my region. I did not know there any specifications for this before buying it.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Tina Fey writes in a fun, fast paced way that makes the reading go quickly.  She is self-effacing, which makes her that much more likeable.  This book is funny, but I was hoping for more meat to it than just small vignettes as chapters.
B000W4KSVA|5.0|Love Coltrane!  His arrangements are unique and beautiful to hear.  Every one of his releases are worth buying!  I could listen to his stuff all day long.
1401322786|5.0|Off beat plot and makes one think. Very thought provoking especially in this present fast paced world in which we live.
B000UWO8XS|2.0|I'll make this short, I am an avid fan of kung fu flicks.  However, this one for me is on the lower end of the spectrum.  My main reason for liking kung fu movies is because of the choreography.  I felt the choreography in this was weak.  I came in with high expectations but this fell short.  The acting was not great and they could have done a better job of putting together the storyline. I watched in both the original audio and english.  I loved the cornball of the English, classic old kung fu.  That part gets 5 stars from me. But the choreography and fight scenes were much weaker than I was expecting.<br /><br />There were a couple of fantastic spinning blade action sequences but too little too late at the end.  The story dragged on for me and became excruciating to watch. The blood and guts was there, but the delivery was very poor to me.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I first saw Malcolm on 60 minutes and found him entertaining and provocative.  His comments on the value of elite education relate to thoughts I have had on and off.<br /><br />With respect to education, I graduated from a low ranked university first in my class and an Ivy League graduate business school far from the top.  In summary I would rank his comments about education and most other topics as simple minded although thought provoking.  He also confuses education with job creation.<br /><br />Is an Ivy League degree useful, though, in finding a job?  When I was drafted into the Viet Nam war, I was immediately assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  About half of the workforce there was Ivy League.  I worked for a number of years after that as a management consultant.in New York.  Almost all Ivy.  Did that make any difference?  Let's just say I have had a prosperous career and know lots of interesting people I probably wouldn't know without the MBA.  How much should I have been willing to pay for this education way back then vs the State school?  Not counting the intangibles, it's in the millions.<br /><br />I'm not trying to give you my life story here.  I'm trying to demonstrate the same thing as the author.  All of these issues is multidimensional with the truth far beyond sound bites and magazine articles.  Although this book is written at the University of Toronto level, it's thought provoking enough to justify its price.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Love the movie and it was never on TV.  So glad to have found it!
B0044DEAUA|4.0|It works fine, but finding a place to mount it can be a challenge. I clipped it to my visor. Easy to use.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wacky funny and fun to play I would use this app all day if I could. Tell your friends they are missing out (^_^)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|While I love a good erotic read as much as the next girl, I found the plot a little predictable at times.  I had really high expectations for this one after hearing so much about it.  I think it's a little cliché, but gave it three stars because I still read the whole thing.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A saga that seems timeless. A young heroine who pulls a hero into her orbit. A tale of survival in a cruel, insensitive society. A make believe world, brought to life by a skilled writer. On to the next in the series!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book had me hooked, expecting things to change for better every next page. That is why, for me, its missing two stars, needed more info, more pages of the nice parts.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love this show,watching it all over again just to make sure I haven't miss anything...Love the crazy ass mother. You will enjoy this show.
B00GQ7PILC|1.0|Are you kidding me? I am just angry and in disbelief that these writers and producers put this junk out in such a desperately apathetic way.
B0018S6YO4|3.0|I bought this because I liked the song Drive, which by the way is a knock off of Blue Monday by Orgy, so that is not even original (I found this out from a friend later and was very unimpressed with Rihanna).  I still appreciate listening to Drive, but every other song is crap.  Total Crap.  Oh wait!  Disturbia is on there... I like that one too.  Ok I will give it 3... haha.
159114325X|5.0|I love all military books but I hadn't any about ships. I am not an expert about ships but this books gives you a great approach to the german capital ships with their stories and plenty of pictures.
0061689246|3.0|The movie was better.  That doesn't happen too often.  There was no clear antagonist in the book and I think that added a lot to the movie.  Still a decent read though.
B000YJ6736|5.0|I \\"discovered\\" Mr Mcewan after watching the movie \\"Atonement\\"; whereupon I read the tremendous novel. His gifts are marvelous; placing the reader within the skin of his  players. This book is a love story like no other; watching Edward and Florence reveal their inner world on their Honeymoon is heart rending tho not without moments of hilarity. . Mr McEwan  is masterful when revealing the clockwork of his characters. Their love is deep, their life together a sure path to happiness. Yet.... We are captured by this rich beautiful tale from the first  pages and as the story unfolds we are wrung out. I would recommend this book to any who often find themselves loving someone they hate or hating someone they love!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I never gamed much on my phone. This is an awesome game on a tablet. Not hard to just start and enjoy.
B00GK5WCV4|5.0|First of all, no this was not exactly like the book. It is BASED on the book. So everyone needs to just calm down and take in the story, and the journey that these characters are on.<br />There were many problems with Lightning thief, that I felt it was made in a way that they were not expecting to make any other films. They never referenced the bigger threat, and the real reason behind his quest.<br />This film attempts to fix that problem, and I say it did a very good job, while still managing to tell the story that the Sea of Monsters had to tell.<br />Kronos is the real threat through out the entire series, and I'm glad that we got to a representation of him, and a glimpse of what is to come.<br />I hope they keep making these movies, because I loved the books, and I do very much enjoy the films.
B00ADQPA38|5.0|This was a gift for my sons who absolutely love it! Can't wait for the current season to come out.!
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Man of Steel is an excellent Superman movie. We finally get see what his powers look like. There was more than enough story, you can definitely sympathize with Zod, trying to save is left of his people. It shows Superman learning to fly, to fight for the first time and loose, it shows why he decides to protect even though in many ways we are no better than the bad guys.<br />Yes there is a lot of destruction in this movie, but what do you think a genocidal madman is going to do? Bake Clark some cookies? No he's going destroy, he's going to kill with no remorse. Everyone who is saying that superman destroyed metropolis needs re-watch the movie, but this time try it with your eyes open.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|This was a gift for one of my sons who requested it as one of his holiday presents. He loves it.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|LIvely music.  Has a unique style of its own.  I like a lot of different style of music and this appeals to me.  I just really like it.
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|Well how can I describe a masterpiece in a customer review? If I say that this is one of the most important albums ever made thats simply an understatement...I am huge cd collector but this is the only album I've bought again in this deluxe edition format.Why? The answer is simple: this album is the soundtrack of my life - lives, breathes and if you have a chance to listen to it in its entirely it will become your best companion. From the chilling opening Mellon Collie to the brilliant closure of Farevell and Goodnight, this album will take you to a ride you'll never forget. Best album ever, period.
B008O69SZ0|4.0|I love Ian Hunter and have since Mott the Hoople. Though this is a good CD, it is not my favorite of his.
B00ADR2DTG|5.0|Wow, I don't think I can go back to listing to music without a tube. The Bravo V2 is a great way to add warmth and saturation to the music you listen to. I bought mine to add to an old 1930's Philco radio cabinet I'm redoing as a hi-fi system. I enjoy the sound from the Bravo so much I'm going to have to buy another one to use at work.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play yet highly addictive. Sometimes it won't renew lives for over 12 hours, which is ridiculous. Very frustrating to see you have to wait over 800+ minutes to play.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Doctor Sleep is quintessential King: well-paced plot, heightening tension for most of the novel, and mostly, three-dimensional characters that most readers will be able to empathize with.<br /><br />Danny Torrance is in his 30's and, unfortunately, has followed his father's footsteps into alcoholism.  Nearing the bottom after a series of lost jobs and terrible decisions, he happens upon a New England town where he can begin to right the ship with the help of people who have also struggled with addiction.  It is here he also becomes reacquainted with his own shining, as he helps to make a stand against forces of evil that live on this talent.<br /><br />One of King's under-rated strengths is his ability to capture both the strengths and foibles of his characters.  His fiction may be plot-centered, but I find the books riveting because the characters have such depth.  Doctor Sleep is a great example of this talent.  I found myself pulling for these characters as if I knew them personally, which is what talented writers are capable of.  A very good read.
B005VOXPO8|4.0|I just picked up this African elephant today at my local &#34;WalleyWorld&#34; for less than seven dollars with tax. It will be a stocking stuffer for my three and a half year old daughter. The figure is extremely detailed and has natural looking colors, markings and textures. A gleam in the eye and a slight shine to the nostrils add to the lifelike appearance. This little toy has a more hefty feel than one might imagine, and is a little bigger than many of the Schleich figures. It should last for many years of play and display. Thanks.<br /><br />SPO
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I love this movie. The love story of the main characters; the struggle of the Aborigines -the humanity.  The acting was great -cinematography. Just a fantastic film.
B001O2QW9G|4.0|I just picked up this turtle today at &#34;WalleyWorld&#34; for less than five dollars. It will be a stocking stuffer for my three and a half year old daughter. The figure is extremely detailed and has pretty natural looking colors and markings. The turtle's size is between a golf ball and a racquet ball, but has a more hefty feel than one might imagine. Should last for many years of play and display. Thanks.<br /><br />SPO
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|Awesome wish I was better so I could get all the holes. I would highly recommend this game. Best free app ever!!
B001O2QW1Y|4.0|I was purchasing some Schleich animals from &#34;WalleyWorld&#34;  to go in my daughter's Christmas stocking, when I noticed this rooster. It's a bit on the small side at about 2 x 2.5 x 1 inches, but it is extremely detailed with very realistic colors, markings, and textures. I got the rooster for myself since I am a University of South Carolina Gamecock, and although it's barely noticeable, this rooster figurine does have spurs on its legs. This figurine obviously would make a great addition to a child's animal collection, but it also makes a great little gift for a Gamecock fan. I paid less than fours dollars for the rooster at my local retailer. Thanks.<br /><br />SPO
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I really like this. The app helps a lot. I know that people think that learning is a little boring and long, but this app is perfect for on the go.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|Love the first half of the CD. Not wild about the second half yet, but I probably will really like it.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|fantastic book using straight forward terms to allow every person to understand the financial crisis and corruption. highly recommended to everyone.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Awesome CD. Really enjoy it.  I think I had this CD at one time, but misplaced it.  I am glad I got this again
B00BL9860K|4.0|God reading but spoilt by coming so soon after &#34;The Hit&#34; which was excellent.  This is a page turner and well worth the effort.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|Did ya think it would be fun being a Shark???  I thought I would cringe but the more I play the more I ENJOY the hunt for fish-turtles-birds and anything that swims along.  Maybe to much for little ones though.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|A little boring in spots. But a reasonably fun read. Would probably not recommend to my wife. I sensed an attempt to monetize The Shining. Better King choices.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I really enjoy this game, the only thing I find wrong with the game is you cannot access it when there is no internet which prevents me from giving it five stars. It is my opinion that we should be able to access our restaurant no matter what so that we can cook. There are times I am without internet and cannot get to the food.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This was the best $15 I ever spent, hands down. Journey alone would have made it all worth it, but Flower, Flow, their respective soundtracks, and all that other extra stuff just really fleshes out this bundle of goodness. thatgamecompany has a beautiful future ahead of them with this phenomenal interactive-art under their belts already.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is Awesome. But I want to say something about something else. When I am on my kindle, and I want to do a test drive, sometimes my kindle freezes. So I have to exit and go back on again. But since the test drive was interrupted, I can't do it anymore. With makes me want to **** the people who did that. That's all.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I am a huge pinterest fan! Love the idea and organization. I am an avid pinner.<br />HOWEVER the app on the kindle fire is glitchy a d stops working about every 6th time I go to use it. It isn't a huge deal breaker because I just have to open it again and it works fine. I can put up with it because I love pinterest enough to deal with it.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Donna Tartt can write beautifully. The beginning of the novel is very good and gives you something to anticipate. Perhaps a good editor could have saved the remaining story. Imagine &#34;Great Expectations&#34; interpreted by Quentin Terrantino, and you've encompased this book. This is not meant as a complement. I forced myself to finish this novel; after throwing it down in frustration more than once. If I want to read about losers, druggies, and alchoholics.........I don't.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|While reading this I had absolutely no idea where it was headed, and it didn't matter, I was just thoroughly invested and captured by Theo and his exploits. At times I found the book maddeningly wordy, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment, and I would say for roughly ninety percent of the book I was completely captured. It was only in the final-and I really mean final-pages that I found myself wandering as the narrative was suddenly peppered with philosophical musings, as the story wrapped up. The comparisons to Dickens aren't unwarranted both for the size and scope as well as the richly textured world, here New York and Vegas, as well as a collection of unforgettable characters. Sweet Hobie, Boris, and of course lovely Pippa. A contemporary book, that feels instantly classic, it certainly is worthy of its praise.
B007HXL1V0|5.0|Helpful for all generations. My great grands were excited when we tried out some of the ideas.  They work for kids and adults.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|There is something about a life in the courtroom that draws trial lawyers to legal thrillers like moths to flame. However, there are very few works that courtroom advocates consider definitive.<br /><br />Now Michael Connelly has placed The Gods of Guilt at the pinnacle of a very short list alongside  [[ASIN:B003B02O0A A Time to Kill: A Novel]], John Grisham's first Jake Brigance novel, and [[ASIN:0446310786 To Kill a Mockingbird]], the Harper Lee classic who brought us Atticus Finch. In doing so, Connelly has surpassed himself and left Mickey Haller's excellent debut novel [[ASIN:B000FCKG1G The Lincoln Lawyer: A Novel (A Lincoln Lawyer Novel)]] in the dust.<br /><br />Haller, who is not above cheap theatrics and sharp practice, is hired to defend the accused killer of a former client. The client, who pays with bars of gold, has earned his fortune as a \\"digital pimp,\\" a contemporary male incarnation of Heidi Fleiss who is accused of strangling her in a dispute over money. The guy swears he's innocent, a status not to be confused with being found not guilty.<br /><br />Haller, who has heard these protestations before comes to believe it. He assembles a time and financed by the rapidly deteriorating client whose stay in Central Lockup is taking a toll. Haller's targets are cops and other law enforcement types. These are dangerous and armed characters.<br /><br />This singular case requires Haller to rise above his limitations as lawyer and human being. It is not a given that the quest for justice  will win out. But a Haller reminds us, our fate is ultimately determined by the Gods of Guilt, some of whom sit in the jury box and some of whom lie within us.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I had trouble getting through the first 2 chapters. I had heard that this was &#34;a return&#34;.  Ms Cornwall's writing is so egocentric it gets in the way of any story telling.  Cornwall's alter ego Kay Scarpetta is so devoid of most human emotion, I am not sure why anyone wants to be around her. This clueless woman has a great deal of book learning and little else to to recommend her, like this book.  Kay is a gaping wound of need without humor, or awareness of beauty around her.<br /><br />Ms Cornwall, take a year off- go for a walk, volunteer at a soup kitchen, a school (middle school- not a college)- be around people- find a sense of humor, find some joy not related to clinical research-- find your humility and maybe you may be able to give Kay some.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Hours and hours of brain challenging and addicting fun. One of the very best creative games I have played. And, oh,<br /> the snoozing music. I seldom write reviews. I just had to here.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|Great low price, lots of instrument sounds, and lots of songs built in to learn to play. I highly recommend this fun little app!
B009MO58G6|5.0|This is Prodigy's best CD to date...the extra CD featuring other versions of their most popular songs from Fat of the Land were interesting.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The best John Grisham I have read in a long long time! Very enjoyable story line and great ending! Highly recommended!
0399157573|5.0|Patricia Cornwell always creates a very excellent read.  The only problem is I have to wait for the next book to come out for publication.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I guess I have just read too many Dr. Scarpetta novels. And for some reason, this one kept putting me to sleep. Great ending though!
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Another awesome Scarpetta novel by Patricia Cornwell.  Can't wait for the next one!  This is my favorite Patricia Cornwell series.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This is great mystery movie.  Love the twists and turns in this film.  Great acting done by all.  We thought our DVD was a copy when we first saw it, but it's the way it's made to look.  I can watch this over and over again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy set-up, opened the box, followed set-up on box for power,  inserted into the HDMI socket and followed the on screen display, the media player was set up in about 10 minutes. Now I watch great movies and what ever I want to.
B00785P2QC|4.0|great app its a ton of fun and i play it a lot would recomend anyone who wants a game like sim city
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is temple run only way better. More levels and options keep you from getting bored. Easily. Not afan of the pay features but fun nonetheless.
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|This is the best book series I have EVER read and for a small price too!! 1 book costs about 9 bucks and 5 books altogether costs 16?! What a deal! Don't worry, there are no spoilers in this review. It teaches you Greek mythology too but at the same time is a mysterious hilarious action adventure comedy book! Get this book!!!
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|This book was easy to read. It is great to get to know a little more about the man behind the \\"legend\\" in as much as you can from a book. It is an honor to read about what he and so many have sacrificed so that this nation remains free. Thank you Chris and thank you to every military family who are and have served this great nation..
B000UJ48O0|5.0|need more great shows like this, A very good show I enjoyed every minute of this show . sad ending when they had to move but they took the Bagel Biter with.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|exactly the right gift for my daughter. she loved it. love the wish list on Amazon. all l had to do was click and buy. perfect.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I purchased this app right after I got my Kindle fire back in August of 2013. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. Since then, it has failed me twice.  Strike One might have somehow been the Kindle's fault. I think this is due to the fact that the whole Kindle had frozen up, screen blank; however, I believe there is a chance that the freeze-up was due to this app, thus the reduction of a rating star... The reason I believe this is due to the fact that my kindle was properly behaving just the evening before the freeze-up. Solving the problem took a call to Amazon customer service. Kudos to them for doing a great job within a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />I place the blame for Strike Two squarely on this app. Deduction of one rating star.  Thursday morning, just one day before I posted this review, the alarm went off at the set time but was NOT playing my chosen music, so I woke up in a bad mood because of the seriously unpleasant tune this app chose to substitute for my music.  I dislike all of the sounds included with this app, so would not choose any of them.  When the settings are selected to play a musical track of my selection, that's what I expect to hear at the appointed time... not some funky piece of muzak I would never have chosen to save my life... YUCK!<br /><br />As of now, I'm looking for a more reliable alarm clock app.  If there is another failure between now and the time I load a replacement app, I'll just uninstall this one and do without the alarm clock function until I can find a suitable app.  Three strikes and you're out...<br /><br />Edit: July 30, 2014<br />I'm still using this app because I can't find another one that's better, as in more reliable.  That said, I wanted users to be aware that the advertising in this app can block the alarm function.  I woke up today over an hour late because the alarm didn't sound at the appointed time.  When I accessed the alarm app to discover why, I found an advertisement for software I don't even want had popped up and would not go away until I responded.  This is poor implementation and a very poor time for advertising to pop up... I had been sleeping, ya know, so that I didn't see that advertisement right away.  This definitely needs to be changed!  Dump the pop-ups!<br /><br />Edit:<br />December 14, 2015.  This app updated late last night or early this morning... and the update is - to me- fatally flawed.  The app can no longer find the MP3 files on my device, so it wants to play the noise (sound and music) files included with the app.  I find those files entirely unacceptable as sounds to which I would wish to awaken.  They put me in a bad mood every time.  While I found this app remotely acceptable when it would play my own music for me to wake up, I cannot condone the downgrade of being confined to choices of noise for wakeup calls. Thus I have downgraded my rating of this app another star with the loss of choices I preferred.  I'm thinking this developer doesn't even try to test the code before they force an update to the app...y until I responded.

B00ERIUO02|5.0|I love all of the songs on this CD.  I would recommend this CD to other Katy Kats out there.
B00594XOZU|5.0|it is awesome I just cant say enough about kik isthmus so fast let me log on to my old account I don't know what all these other comments are saying
B007EZJKS2|5.0|The art work in this graphic novel was gorgeous. I couldn't get it to display properly on my computer, with the text being far too small to read, but it worked perfectly on my Kindle Fire. Don't even think about trying it on your phone. This is something to keep in mind before purchasing the kindle version of this book. This is a beloved story from my childhood and likely many of yours, about a unicorn who discovers she is the last of her kind, and sets out on a quest to discover what happened to the others. I read this version to my five year old son. This version, I found, was almost word-for-word like the movie, but with a few additional details and scenes. Except that the art work in this book was so beautiful, the movie pales in comparison. There was more realism, more detail. Schmendrick appeared a less silly and more compelling. Molly was also quite pretty, although of course none of them compare with the Unicorn herself.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This product was shipped quickly. The whole transaction was very smooth. I didn't open the product because it is a Christmas gift but it is in good condition
0061564893|5.0|The book that opened my eyes. I love the work that brother Menzies and team produces. When I went to school, dinosaurs were cold blooded and continental drift was a myth.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|All she went through with Max and Rudy, such a great story of what is really important in life.  Love.
B00656C6KK|4.0|LOVE DORIS DAY .... but I didn't love the originals by her son....sorry, Doris, I know how that goes....you want your kid to be as good as the original but most of your fans don't agree.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Love this game it's the best games ever you can do practically everything with you own Tom he also copes you voice such a good game.
B0037VNX44|1.0|Don't watch this... terrible movie. Bad acting, wackadoo storyline, nothing good about it. Just... don't watch it. It's truly awful.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Easy to use and find android apps.  Most apps are good and work.  Plus Amazon is just plain a good site to use.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Generic action movie with little plot. I enjoyed the last two bond films but this one just felt stale. If you are expecting a great bond film look else ware.
030758836X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read!! The entire book was a page turner and kep me on the edge of my seat. I loved this book!! I think she should write the sequel..What a talented writer, WOW
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google for iPhone is very easy to use, and it was so very helpful when we were traveling over the holidays.
B00F2362IE|4.0|I love this game but the bad thing about it is that you cant keep the little upgrade things so um...
B0060MYM3S|5.0|i am just plain hooked on Game of Thrones, books, audio books and now the DVDs to watch over and over.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|the box advertises that you can &#34;send video or anything on the web to your tv from your smartphone tablet or laptop&#34;...it also states that it works with &#34;...iOS...&#34;. While it can stream YouTube, Netflix, Pandora, HBO Go, and Hulu Plus on my iPhone and iPad, it CANNOTstream google Play and Chrome as it also advertises on the box. This is device may be able to &#34;send video or anything on the web to your tv &#34;, but only under certain circumstances on certain devices. The marketing implies that it can do everything exactly the same on ALL smartphones, tablets or laptops...not true!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is well written and very imaginative.  It is interesting to watch what the author allows to take place when what we reasonable take to be limits on what is possible are lifted.  I also enjoyed the character development.
080419369X|5.0|This is my all-time favorite book on cd! I love the book itself, but the reader Tracie Bennett is absolutely fantastic! She hits the inflections in the voices she creates for the characters just perfectly. I have heard another reader narrate this book as well, but she cannot compare to Ms. Bennett. I listen to this book whenever I am feeling down, and it never fails to cheer me up and make me laugh! I lent it to my sister, who lent it to a friend of hers and so on and so on....until I had to practically threaten death to get my cd back! Nobody wanted to give it back...it's THAT good. AND you won't be able to get the phrase \\"Una Alconbury's turkey curry buffet\\" out of your head! ha ha
B002NUULNG|2.0|The Blu-ray re-release is bad. It has a bunch of pointlessly added in CGI sequences in place of the original animation... Including the iconic opening scene. Way to s*** on the origonal artists that created this film. It really kinda interrupted the film for me. I also here that colors where changed and some content was missing? I dunno for sure since it been a while since i saw the unedited one.<br />If you love the -original- film SKIP THIS BLU-RAY!
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|This is a really awesome Blu-ray. The movie has never looked this good. I highly recommended this for any movie fan.
B004K8WPUQ|2.0|I did a lot of research prior to purchasing a microphone for my DSLR, and after all the recommendations and raves that this product got, I was very excited to receive it and take it out for some amateur filming. As soon as I opened it, I was a bit worried about how flimsy it felt, but since everyone else seemed to have such a great experience with it, I figured that it was nothing to worry about... too much.<br /><br />First let me say that the audio quality on this is not bad, if I had to give the audio quality itself a star rating, it would be a 4, maybe even a 5. It was good for my purposes anyway. But the hot shoe mount and basically everything else is made of a very cheap plastic. It feels like it will break if it accidentally brushes against you slightly, and that's exactly what happened - the piece that connects the screw top to the hot shoe mount broke on my second outing. I handled it with as much care as I could, and was very disappointed when the pieces broke and I had no way of putting it back together. For the money, I expected something sturdier.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I like this game as it is easy to learn.  It has different levels for how hard you really want to work and think.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This flash works really well.  My pictures are much better in the daylight without shadows.  I stick to Nikon in general but I would imagine this is also just as achievable with cheaper options.  I like the TTL since it works auto for you...but for serious shooting I find it too harsh and drowns the shot.  Full disclosure: I am a newb with flash.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Very interesting book. Mr. Gladwell paints a very clear picture with his words. This is a book I will suggest to my friends for a good holiday gift.
6304696558|5.0|Goldie Hawn, being petite, plays her role as a happily married stay-at-home wife, and when her husband of a few hours dies of a heart attack, she finds herself enlisting in the Army!  She is a dynamic character in this fabulous movie!
0761169253|5.0|This book is brilliant. It's a nice, smaller (6&#34; x 6&#34;) softcover, but a nice quality with good paper. I'd give this as a gift. As a writer I find every word relevant and true. A definite recommend for anyone in a creative field.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I really liked this app, then Yahoo came out with an upgrade and it has a lot of glitches and timing issues.  This was a five star app and I now rate it two because half my emails never make it out of the outbox.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This wonderful story is an interesting, informative, and easy read filled with emotion. I highly recommend it to anyone. It's not just for dog lovers!
B005FPT51K|5.0|This monitor was a replacement for a Motorola system which turned out to be a huge disappointment!!  Very shoddy.  Since my grand daughter is 3 years old, i didn't see the sense in investing in an entire system yet again, and ordered this as an option as you only need to purchase the monitor.  It has been a hugely pleasant surprise.  It pans the room and zooms in and can be seen from a number of devices which we already own.  It is phenomenal product and I am surprised that Apple doesn't make more of it.  Love it!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|We just love this movie!  It really gets the kids into the Christmas spirit.  I love their take on how the north pole looks too!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Give me more, more more.  Cannot wait for season 4.  You just become attached to the characters. Very addictive.  Haven't been this hooked on a series since &#34;Friday Night Lights.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|Tell you what....  After seeing the previews for this when it first came out I had no plans of seeing it.  However I eventually gave in and saw it, before it left the theatre.  It is actually a very good movie that had me laughing from start to finish.  Especially loved Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise in this flick.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|2 songs on this album really got me in the Christmas mood. &#34;White is in the Winter Night' and &#34; One Toy Soldier&#34;. And really if you are a fan of Enya  you will want this CD.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|Wayne Shorter is a genius. His playing never sounded better.<br />The group is captured at the peak of it's powers.<br />This album is more cohesive than the previous one, &#34;Beyond the Sound Barrier&#34;<br />The best song, &#34;Pegasus&#34;, features a woodwind quintet in addition to the group.<br />It's a live cut. I hope there's more of that to be released.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Positive: Perfect for producing, perfect for listening to high quality sound.<br /><br />Negative (although none of this matters in the end): Not good for commutes, it can be heard nicely around you, not good for low quality sound, sounds ... low quality.<br /><br />They are amazing, beautiful full bodied sound. Everything is well balanced, nuances are present. I can't say much, they're just great.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|GREAT continuation of my favorite book of all times.  The Shining was by far a better book but I love knowing how the characters turned out
B006LSZECO|4.0|A real pleasure to read the words as strung together by the author to describe the events and shape the characters. The plot twists would come at you without warning and catch you off guard and make you rethink much of what you had already digested. All of the minor characters were really well defined and believable and they gave the story lots of extra punch.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|Brand new condition. Good quality. Excellent series storyline. Recommended DVD star wars series for all star wars fan, especially the clone wars.
B0017VG69U|3.0|I think I bought this used like new. A lot of the discs skip and I have to go back to the beginning and try to fast forward past the part that skips. It's annoying.
B00F3VOL38|4.0|Very nice recording of The Beatles at the BBC. I enjoy the music, the interviews are a bit silly. Nice collectors item for Beatles fans.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I wanted to be the first kid on my block with a Zombie Head Aquarium, so I bought this.  I've not been disappointed.
B0035JJJE6|5.0|Best toy for the Xenomorph lover. My 6 yo loves it and goes well in our collection. Would recommend to any one.
1250038820|5.0|I gave this book to my photographer husband as a gift.  He loves it.  Makes a great coffee table book.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Love Dexter but it did have a weak ending to an epic series but a must have for the collection.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is one intense movie. It lets you see what these guys are going through. I grew up in the Vietnam era and lost a lot of friends.  This really lets you know what goes on in a fire fight and how everyone depends on everyone.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great sequel to The Shining. It kept me up late at night because I couldn't put it down. His best work in years!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It sounded interesting and it is.  It opens your mind for greater possibilities and this is what life is about.<br /><br />I am still working with the book.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I was looking to use this on my son's NABI II but it does not work and I get return it back because it is a software item.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Just get hooked after the first time. Funny little minion is best time pass right now. Love them will recommend.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I liked the Giver. It had some unexpected things happen that you had no clue. I really loved this book.
0440237688|5.0|Dystopian books may be widely popular right now, but they're anything but new. Before there was The Hunger Games and Divergent and Legend and every other new dystopian YA series, there was The Giver (which I suppose can technically be considered an utopian series, depending on your opinion). I wanted to revisit one of the classics that I remember being fascinated by as a young reader but didn't remember in detail, so I listened to The Giver on audio book and reconnected with a book that reminds me why I love reading.<br /><br />In eleven year old Jonas' world, everything is controlled and perfect. Decisions for every facet of life are made by the government, from who they marry to how many children they have and what their job will be in society. When Jonas turns twelve he is assigned the special role of Receiver of Memory in which the Giver of Memory transmits the history of the world to Jonas by memories. With pleasing memories such as snow and love come painful memories such as sunburn and hunger. As Jonas receives memories, he begins to develop feelings that everyone else in society are void of having and he struggles with living in a society where he must carry the weight of emotions alone.<br /><br />The premise of this story alone is fascinating: a government in which no decisions are made and everything operates perfectly. Nobody truly feels love and in effect nobody really feels loss when a member is &#34;Released&#34;. While life may sound somewhat boring, it's simple, and even lively members, such as Jonas' friend Asher, are able to find a place. The understanding that everything that leads to choices, opinions, and emotions is sacrificed by society in order for members to live a &#34;perfect&#34; life becomes too great of a price to pay for ignorant Jonas as he gains emotions. This poses the same question for readers: Would we be willing to sacrifice all the good things in order to protect ourselves from the bad things? Would you sacrifice sunshine to avoid sunburn? Would you sacrifice seasons to avoid hunger? Would you sacrifice love to avoid loss?<br /><br />This book is not very complex. The premise requires some imagination, but the questions Lowry poses can be processed by readers of all ages. As a child reader and as an adult reader I was and am captivated by this story. It causes the reader to consider life and society from any position on the spectrum of your lifespan. It calls to question whether a utopia is even achievable without sacrificing so much that said utopia can be viewed equally as a dystopia. No matter the age of the reader, this book is a great conversation piece for what we're willing to give up for a perfect life before that perfect life becomes less than ideal.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Everyone should read this book. I believe that even people who don't consider themselves readers will be drawn in by this world and the questions this book poses. 5/5 stars.
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|Loved this book.  It provides insight into the inner workings of Skunk Works during a very interesting time in the history of the U.S.

B00199B2Z8|5.0|I just simply love Bryson's ability to load each paragraph, regardless of his subject matter, into 'thesis statement', explanation, and then wrap it up with a punch line - usually leaving me laughing lots!  He has never disappointed - and I am bummed that not all his books are available on Kindle.  OBTW, &#34;A Short History of Almost Everything&#34; I read every summer, for shear fun...for four summers now: its such a great read, and wow, packed with oodles of information!
B008XG1X18|3.0|It  is not all it promised for me. I had expected a load of creative ideas. It is possible that I am looking for a different kind of creativity
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This is the ultimate wake-up call!  Even for we vegans and vegetarians, a lot of good information to revamp our diets.  If you're concerned with Alzheimer disease, if it runs in your family, read this book.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I can check weather conditions locally and all over the world. Whenever I talk to my friends in foreign locations, they confirm the accuracy of the reports and forcasts. A terrific app!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Amazing book! Exciting and definitely a tear jerker at time. A great end to the series. Wish there was more!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My Alarm Clock is the best clock ever. It should not be named My Alarm Clock because it does so much more.<br />I can set a time and fall asleep, listening to my favorite music and wake up in the morning to my favorite music.<br />It works as a desk clock which is easy to read during the night since it is iluminated.  It also shows me the weather condition. It is a wonderful, versatile app.
B00FVZJUS2|5.0|Because its funny and the minions are just great!! The theme with the 3girls is cute and tender.Just love it.

B0090P98Z4|4.0|It's a fun game so far. I'm only on level five, but I've enjoyed it. It is ok.<br /> In don't know what else g they want me to say.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|As a senior person, I feel that Candy Crush is more than just a game, it is challenging and it makes me have to think fast.  Hopefully this is going to help this old brain.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|I agree with the previous reviewer that its too bad it's not in widescreen as it was filmed for the screen to begin with.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME! The game makes me feel like I'm on a real hunt and is fun to play to pass time.
B00GME9AJK|5.0|Amazing movie so inspiring that it made wanna work harder on my company! Ashton Kutcher did a fabulous job and frankly surprised me. I think this movie deserves an oscar just for inspiration. I need to watch this movie every day.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a pretty cool game, but it's hard to get those coins with the letter on it. &deg;~&deg; Other than that it's cool.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|classic works like this get me every time. And I thought the movie part was the only part! Kipling was a literary genius, and for that, I applaud him.
B003HE2B6C|5.0|Love the entire album! I forgot how talented this band is. My kids love it too. I'm not ashamed to say that I'm a Hanson fan!
0761174192|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best daily cat calendar. Photos are funny and very high-quality. The paper is much better than on &#34;regular&#34; daily calendars. I have been buying it for myself for 5 years now and also as an inexpensive Christmas gift to some cat-loving friends and relatives.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I don't usually like the young adult novels but I enjoyed this book. The characters are wise beyond their years. There were a few twists that kept the plot moving. It is a difficult subject to read about but I thought the author did a good job keeping the mood light. I would recommend this book if you can handle a tough subject.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I've been using it for two days now and it works well.<br />I'm using an old smartphone (connected to my Wi-Fi, with no cell service) as a remote control. Interesting that it's not a remote control in a regular sense - you don't need to point it at the TV. For example, I start the Netflix app on that phone, choose the movie or show to play, and press the Cast button instead of Play. It sends instructions over the Internet to Netflix to send the show to the Chromecast device attached to my TV, So the phone (remote control) and Chromecast communicate via the Internet, not directly. It's been very reliable. Theoretically, I could be in another city and use my phone to start casting a show to my home TV (if it was turned on). Maybe if I had a dog at home and wanted to entertain it... It may be good for tech support of gadget-challenged relatives. You can control their casting remotely when they get stuck.<br />I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5, because it supports a limited number of channels. If you only use Netflix, HBO GO, or Hulu Plus, then you are fine. There's also Google Play. But you can't cast Amazon Instant Video or many other services that Roku or other streaming players support. I got this Chromecast player for one of the TV's on which I'll be fine with a limited choice of channels and I'll continue using Roku on other TVs.<br />On the plus side, it's cheaper than other players and easy to install and activate.<br />If your TV has a USB port, then you just plug the device to the HDMI port and the USB port on the TV and it's neat and hidden from view. If the TV doesn't have a USB port, then you can plug it into a regular electrical outlet through a converter (which is included).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A very good read. I would recommend to anyone who likes a good love story.  50  shades of  grey excellent.
B001CTDH76|5.0|We borrowed these DVD's from my cousins, and they were so good we had to get our own set.  Patrick Jane is something of a trickster character, but rarely mean-spirited.  It's interesting to see a show deal with such heavy topics so lightly.
0783226888|5.0|A really great movie. Alternate ending is better than the one<br />chosen. More true to the story. Good acting by all. Even Gere!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|We're real fans of The Mentalist.  I like how it's less predictable than other shows.  We don't anticipate that a certain episode will be a hallucination,  a flashback, etc. before we get there.
B008JFUPOY|3.0|Cute, inoffensive family fare; it's nice to get back in touch with two of my favorite Pixar characters, but this film is so light, airy and spacious I couldn't help wondering if we all might have been better served by a short featurette. Most of the returning secondary cast is relegated to brief cameos - particularly Steve Buscemi's serpentine villain Randall, who pops in and out in a set of very brief flashes - and their replacements generally play one note at best. In its heart, Monsters U is dying to mimic the kind of campus-friendly formula perfected by Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds, but it's kneecapped by a much younger target audience and the cast feels almost universally shoehorned into unfamiliar terrain. It enjoys some lively moments and a few solid laughs, plus the banter between Goodman and Crystal is as sharp as ever, but the scope feels much, much smaller than the preceding Monsters Inc. and the story never really shifts out of first gear.
B0053O89JM|5.0|We've watched every episode of House.  It's one of our favorite shows.  There's a lot of medicine, not just soap opera.  The ending was a surprise, but consistent with the show.
B008JFUR10|3.0|Knocking out an entire film's worth of back story before the opening credits, Pacific Rim doesn't waste any time in getting to the good stuff: thousand-foot monsters are swapping haymakers with their robotic counterparts inside of ten minutes. If you were expecting anything different, well, I'm not sure why because Pan's Labyrinth this ain't. It's exactly what the promo materials promised: a big-budget SFX sandwich with a dense layer of sci-fi sensibility spread through its guts. Hold the subtlety and nuance.<br /><br />Fans of the classic monster movie will be, no doubt, tickled to see the evolution of that format (though some of these beasts are so foreign and complex, it's often tough to distinguish up from down amidst the mayhem of a fight scene) but I was somewhat puzzled by its herky-jerk pacing and weird sense of identity. It's a tale that can't choose between serious action and gaudy eccentricity, so it tries to move in both directions without luck. Likewise, I had difficulty looking past the odd jumble of TV stars mashed together at the center of it all, drawn from very different sources and plunked down together in a series of comically mismatched back-and-forths. The action is good, and abundant, but the plot is quite thin and the core characters are all basic caricatures. It's worth a watch, but only as a home theater demo or a simple bit of drunken escapism.
B00340LM8C|5.0|A classic from the word go. I have watched many times over the years and even tough I know how it ends, I know I will watch it again sometime in the future.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|This item does have some flaws in the port sizes and one of my ports is broke. You have to be very careful and if a usb plug is not fitting, don't force it. Seems some just don't fit perfectly. However, for the money, it is very good. There are much more expensive ones out there that probably don't break as easily. I give it 4 stars because of this and because of the extremely high class team that is selling these. They went above and beyond to ship me a new one and make sure I was happy.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|If you're a Stryper or Melodic Rock music fan... you must do you yourself a favor and pick this one up. Outstanding!!!
B00DL2W7Q4|5.0|Excellent and highly recommended, David and Goliath is a tour de force and candidly ought to be required reading for anyone aspiring to elective office, the boardroom or the sacristy.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This movie has humour, nuance, tragedy, and stories of the survival of the spirit in the face of disaster.  It is a gentle movie, in spite of the subject matter.  The acting, direction, and filming bring the story to life beautifully.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great season to have on DVD.  Especially the season finale.  Good quality as well.  Can't wait for season four to come out.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Whoever thought that macca was out of it...think again.  His voice may be coarse at times but the songs in this cd are solid.  The groove on &#34;appreciate&#34; speaks for itself.  The man has been out there for a long time, and that doesn't mean mean he has lost anything.  He is still finding ways to express his music in a way that can be appreciated by everyone.  Just listen to the album.  I know that McCartney has had hit and misses in his career....but I don't think this is one of them.  Just listen...isn't that what music is all about? Listening?
0425266060|1.0|I ablsolutly hated these books.  Could not even finish the last one.  I felt the sex scenes were written by a teenage boy.  No imagination in the bedroom scenes at all.
B0084B0656|5.0|Chesterton is awesome.  There are many quotes to memorize from this book.  This book is one of the reasons he is the apostle of common sense.
B000ICLRHK|5.0|Loved the blu-ray version of this fantastic movie.  Really made the action more exciting.  Especially the under the bus scene.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down. I would definitely recommend it. A different perspective on World War II.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I rarely cry when I read. I did. I don't know that I could watch the movie. If you are the type of person that can vividly picture a story as you read it....well, you will smile at times and cry at others when reading this one.
B00DERIV8Y|3.0|The positive: The figure is highly detailed and is the best looking figure in the Walking Dead series. The knife fits (yay)<br />The inexcusable negatives: (1) The crossbow does not fit / is extremely hard to fit into Daryl's hand. You will have to bend the hand and fingers to get it in there. That of course risks breaking the hand. (2) The figure has poor balance and almost zero articulation in the lower body. If you do mange to make it stand, it will eventually fall over. (3) To put the poncho on, you have to tear off the head. No instructions are included and I can see how others have easily broken their figures. It is clear to me that these figures were not tested and quality control was non existent in those key areas. Overall, I am disappointed in this figure.
B00C9G22R2|2.0|The film was a bit confusing with a lot of north vs. south kung fu fighting while the Japanese had invaded the land. The story centers on IP man and Zhang Yongcheng, their relationship, fighting known as the 64 hands, gaining the Gong family legacy, and a button. Not being overly familiar with the story of IP man, I found myself scratching my head as the tale seems to assume you know it as well as knowing Chinese culture. I do not and for that reason, I didn't get much from the film which was lengthy and at times a docu-drama. If people weren't fighting, they were talking. It appeared as if China took old newsreels, colorized them and stuck them into this production. The film also includes some ridiculous anti-gravity fighting.<br /><br />If you are not into kung fu or know the history of Ip man, this is not your film.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 2 written f-bombs. No sex or nudity.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|Must see movie of the tragic life of Gia the famous model from NY state.  Angelin Jolie is Gia and plays the role to perfection.  A must have for any collector of great movies.
B00860YICC|4.0|This is an interesting movie with a theme I had never seen before.  Sad in some ways but uplifting in others.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|It is a great freecell game that tracks stats. It makes it more fun to play a lot of games to try to improve your stats.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Very funny in many places.  There is no real message except we put up with a lot of things from family during the holidays!
B000HKT7RK|4.0|Love love love!  After watching the Julia Child's movie, I had to get this.  The recipes are a bit long (hey what are you going to do -it's French!) but they are absolutely delicious. My daughter wants some Beef Bourguignon for her birthday and she's only 11!
B000B8L6LI|5.0|Great pricing and highly recommended by a retired gun and knife enthusiast in our PD family! Giving for Christmas! !!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very touching, beautifully written story of love, loss, hardship and ultimately, reconciliation and closure.<br />I look forward to the next gem.
B00DZVKQGY|1.0|most boring book I've dragged myself through  pedantic writing,one dimensional characters, repetitious descriptions.  gave up reading before the anticipated redemption.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Is good clean reading, very interesting even for an adult.  When I was young my first books I loved were Nancy Drew mysteries was always a book worm would highly recommend these for teens and even younger I am 71 years old, love John Grisham, have read all his books and have liked all four of the Theodore Boone books also.
1476734941|5.0|Really impressive, highly effective diet. We started on this many months ago and have not looked back. Lost weight, better cholesterol, feel better. Can not say enough how well this is working for us.

B00C50NV2M|5.0|Good value for the money. A great gift for our daughter and family to enjoy their 3D movies they recently obtained.
B0085OEIOC|4.0|An academy award winning performance by Val though not as funny as I remember, when I watched it when I was 12.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is very fun and I have to tell myself to put my kindle down and stop playing lol. I think my boyfriend is a lil jealous of the time I spend with the game ;-)
B005KP7EO0|3.0|This was a bit slow.  Not alot of action but still not one you will turn off.  A different side of Butch Cassidy.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Excellent read! Pendergast just keeps getting better. The suspense and plot twists hold the attention throughout. Looking forward to the next one!
1433524708|5.0|Great Study Bible, I have the larger size for myself. This was for my wife, the size is smaller and she likes that more. Prices on Amazon were much better than local shops.
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|This watch looks wonderful on and my husband loves it.  The only negative is that the clasp isn't very strong and he's always afraid it's going to come undone.  It hasn't yet, but it's a concern.  Very nice looking and has a very slim profile.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great Movie, wish I would have bought and not rented this film from Amazon Instant. Would like to watch a couple more times.
0393064476|5.0|&#34;the Swerve&#34; is a  delectable, detective story, set in mid-15th century, anno domini, pre-Renaissance Europe, telling in great detail the trials and tribulations  of a certain monk, y-clept Poggio, and his dogged search for uncorrupted texts from antiquity, particularly from ancient Rome.<br /><br />Monasteries were repositories, par excellence, of such weighty tomes. But librarians those days were unfamiliar with the Dewey Decimal System, so Poggio's task was not an easy one, as he traveled from place to place searching dusty monastic corners for texts not yet uncovered.<br /><br />The author, Stephen Greenblatt, makes the search interesting. But his book is not called &#34;the Search&#34;, but rather &#34;the Swerve &#34;,  and It is his contention that Poggio's finding of Lucretius' epic poem, &#34;De Rerum Natura&#34; (&#34;On the Nature of Things&#34;), was so monumental as to cause the world of the so-called Middle Ages to swerve, that is to say, to be bumped out of its doldrumish orbit into the splendor of the Renaissance, and subsequently into our modern world.<br /><br />Beware, gentle reader. You may be enticed to pick up a copy of &#34;On the Nature of Things&#34; itself. If you do, you may be jolted out of your doldrums too.
B006U9IY76|5.0|Our son has a lot of the Stack Track and really enjoys playing with them for hours at a time. All trains are well made and very durable. This is a good product. My son will play for hours with these trains. These don't work on traditional wooden train tracks.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This last book is a great conclusion to the stories.  However don't read if you haven't read previous four books.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|A joy to watch the diversity of raising children. Each child was loved and cared for by their family and well taken care of

B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Scarpetta is very introspective in this novel.  She has been sick so is weaker than usual.  She and Lucy and Benton and Pete work out the murders but there is more angst in this book than usual.  The realism of these novels is due to,the research done by Cornwell and it shows.  These are sophisticated characters with human frailties and foibles.  It is a joy to read these books.
0307454541|5.0|You know those people who say &#34;I couldn't put the book down!&#34;?  I dont understand those people at all, I mean, dont you have a tv?  Well, thanks to this crazy swedish murder-mystery, I now understand those people.  I actually WANTED to read ... A BOOK!  So great, I quickly gobbled up the sequels, and loved them all.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|got this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it. he's a huge star trek fan and he was surprised that i got him the correct one (he prefers the command like picard). it fits with his other themed gifts as well.
1433502410|5.0|Great translation, with an effortless readability.  Plus, the study version provides lots of interesting features and background infromation.  Great color maps and diagrams to bring the text to life.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|brilliant acting, cheeky swinger-era type humor and attire, a great take on superhero films, as if the xmen were in Austin Powers' world, awesome!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Intersting and engaging.  It would have earned a 5th star if it had been a little more succinct.  The story is pretty basic, and I appreciate that the filmmaker took his time with the movie.  But it just felt like it dragged a little.  Solid acting by (almost) the entire cast.  Worth a watch.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My oldest grandson 9 yrs old now --started watching about 7 yrs ago. He loved it! I have 3 more grandchildren now & we have watched it at least 4 times in the last 2-3 weekends. They are loving it as well. This copy I just purchased is for my grandson who is 4yrs old. This will make the 4th copy of Polar Express that I have purchased for use for the grandchildren. The Polar Express is a great gift for the children.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book is more than about habits. If you're interested in examining life and changing yours, this is a wonderful read to jump start the process. I literally just finished and feel so inspired- to examine my habits and change the ones that don't serve me do well! I'll add that it ends up a quick-read. Meaning, you'll find yourself unable to put it down after a few pages! Well done!
B000AOEMXM|5.0|It completes the Star Trek collection. Filling in much of the pre-original series gaps that the other series failed to fill.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Always been my favorite solitaire game because it uses those dendrites. Many other solitaire games are just games of chance. This one stimulates brain activity. I'm not a neurologist but this game has made me sharper.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Stop watching after season 2. It goes downhill from there and like a lot of series they really mess things up.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love it and would highly recommend you get it but in the song book they don't have all the songs I wanted and that frustrated me. They have like Lady gaga's &quot;Applause&quot; and Christmas stuff but they don't have a lot to choose from. I have never played piano before and this is a good start for me :) thanks for reading!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This story made me a fan of Matthew Quick. He's written a book full of damaged yet driven characters - folks you're compelled to root for. After reading it, I knew why Hollywood snapped it up and turned out a reasonably faithful adaptation.
1451627297|5.0|With the 50th. anniversary of the Kennedy assassination, this work is one of King's best.  What would have happened if you could go back in time and prevent this event?  Where were you on 11/22/63?
