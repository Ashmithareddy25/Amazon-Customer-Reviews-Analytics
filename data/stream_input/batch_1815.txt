B000MPEIF6|3.0|All the reviews gave it good reviews which is understandable for an earlier zombie movie. but having to buy it kinda sucked, because i just wanted to rent it. not worth the money
1846147522|5.0|After reading this book, you will look at the world in an entirely different way.  There are things you cannot control but to manage risk you must be able to evaluate it.
0375842209|4.0|You really feel the writer's perspective and the story keeps you interested.<br />This is a relatively fast read for anybody.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|As someone who first fell in love with The Piano Guys through YouTube, I was a little skeptical if their music would hold up when my eyes weren't engaged. And would my kids ask to listen just as much as they ask to watch?<br /><br />Turns out there was no reason to be skeptical. Every moment of this CD is listening joy. We rock to it as a family, and I listen to it alone as a pick-me-up. This album has jumped to one of my top favorites. Thanks guys!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|There were so many things that I loved! Magical realism and the circus. The visuals evoked. It was a fairly dark book, and it reminded me of the movie The Prestige with the competitions and over topping of opponents with magic. The book was much better, of course!
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie is pretty faithful to the book series, and thought I would disagree with some of the casting choices, all of the actors do a great job at portrayal of the characters and the story, definitely worth picking up a copy for a serious Hunger Games fan. As for the product itself, very handy to get the discs and the digital copy together, very convenient.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed it - but I usually like Grisham's stories very much.<br />Nicely designed plot and nice characters.<br />Well done mate.
B00138J6VM|5.0|Great songs on other albums but this is the album where most every song is genius. Definitely the first  album I'd recommend to someone who didn't know them.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Essential reading for Near Death Experience scholars and the interested general public.<br /><br />The author has no doubt experienced harrowing and uplifting events but how extraordinary is his case?<br />The main question in my view is whether such experiences have any universal significance.<br />Moreover, did what the author &#34;saw&#34; really occur during the time his brain was &#34;dead&#34;?<br />Could he have &#34;seen&#34; the scenes he describes only during a very short period (seconds?) when his brain was booting up (or shutting down)?<br /><br />Do we know enough about the anatomy and physiology of the material brain?<br />This story may hint at the immensity of our ignorance of this subject - even the neurosurgeons amongst us.<br /><br />Finally, another questionable matter is the mention of God in his account, his personal interpretation of events and his conclusions.
B00006AW63|1.0|Purchased this DVD for our grand children and unknowing to us it will not play in the US.  What a disappointment.<br />Apparently it came from the UK.  Customers in the US should be warned of the problem.
1451683405|5.0|This book is short, but precise. Sam Harris got to the point. He had even the space to put a little humour here and there. It was easy for me to identify with the idea on this book, because I had for a long time the same thoughts about free will. Buy it!
B00ADII8YE|5.0|Love this show! It is a must watch for anyone! Can't wait for the rest of the season to come out
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|i figured this would be a lot more funny than it was.  there were funny parts, but there were also very serious parts and those parts of the movie kind of felt like the movie was dragging on.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I was able to get a full refund promptly from the seller of this printer.  It was an incomplete order, an honest mistake. I bought another printer in the interim, so did not need to keep the one I had ordered. I appreciate the great service! Thank you!

B005KPDAN4|5.0|Love this series, wish there were more!!  What more can you say?  Excellent writing for this show, and its nice to watch episodes without commercials!
B007THA4FI|1.0|if you find profanity offensive, you will not be able to read this book.  I expected something dark given Rowling's Potter books, but this was seedy, sordid, and i felt like i needed a shower for my mind after reading a third of the book.  Kept hoping it would improve, it didn't, it's gone.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|They are great.  Buy it. It's completely worth it. Every song is beautiful and powerful.  Not a b-side on the entire album.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Any good mystery involves surprises.  Flynn not only moves in unexpected directions, but describes characters about whom you care increasingly, for good or ill, about the directions that the plot turns.  Excellent plotting and development.
0425263916|2.0|I read the first book in the Crossfire Series this spring and liked the overall style. When I began reading Reflected in You, I was hopeful to see this couple grow and overcome some of their issues. However, more than half way through the book I had to stop reading. None of the questions that had been raised had been answered and every problem was solved through sex. Eva loses herself to her man, steamrolled by his every action. Their relationship fails to grow. Having been in a number of relationships where the power balance is off, I can tell you that this relationship would never work. Eva just keeps beating herself up, saying she needs to be stronger. She expects nothing from her partner. I just can't stand to read about a relationship that is this unhealthy that somehow never ceases to be. In the real world it wouldn't happen.
1455519006|5.0|Just finished it and another great book by David Baldacci.  I purchased the paper back and it looked like brand new.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|You must read the book to enjoy the movie.  You have more of an appreciation for the movie when you know their backgrounds and motives.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I love the entire series. I look forward to Thursday nights to catch a new episode. Having purchased this set, my friends were able to catch up to current episodes.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry seems to be a little more &#34;rogue&#34;  this time, but he always comes out on top. Maybe Michael Connelly is setting it up for a big one.  And who is this Mendenhall?  Maybe she will be featured in the next book.  She seems to be more than meets the eye.  Can't want until the next book.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|This one was slow moving compared to others. I liked it, of course, but won't be watching this one over and over again like the others.

B0060D49VW|4.0|I enjoyed part one much better. However, it was still pretty good. Channing only shows up for one dance in the beginning.
0553801473|5.0|Another great book in the series. I loved reading it. Buying the hard cover made no sense though, since all my other GOT books are soft cover and much smaller. Looks like an abomination in my bookshelf :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|super fun and addicting like the original. however very annoying marketing. why not advertise as a paid app but offer a free trial? pretending to be free is not cool but the game is so fun I still give it 4 stars.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have listened to The Piano Guys for quite a while (I have my founding member tshirt and signed CD) This CD is a great representation of what they do. I actually bought one for about 5 people on my christmas list - and 2 of them are for teenagers! (this is what they requested)- I love the fact that they offer up their arrangements too on their website! This music is what 'being global' is all about! - they even take songs that I was not crazy about and made me love them! If you are looking for something new/fresh in music - then I would definately recommend this CD. And you have to watch the videos on youtube. Their smile and positive attitude is contagious!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|quality-one-collectors, the company that sold me the movie (DVD) was fabulous to work with. They were caring, helpful, thorough and above all did what they said they would do. Quality-one-collectors just do it right! I would recommend highly and I look forward to doing more business with them soon.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|An excellent fantasy novella by Brandon Sanderson.<br />The &#34;magic system&#34; is unique and the tale is a fun ride.  We hope Brandon writes more of these!
B004G600A4|4.0|Purchased the movie as  gift.  It was an exceptional hit with her and her friends who have watched countless times. Great service.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I tried my best to watch this movie, but was bored to pieces.  Maybe it might have something good about it if I could have stayed awake to finish it.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  People who give this good reviews must lead a very boring life.  I really thought I would like it, but forget this one.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|I am really not a big fan of short stories, but I tried it because I do enjoy the Harry Bosch series.  It was pretty good, but I miss the usual time to fill out the storyline more.

B006LS7DQE|1.0|I totally love this game, BUT completely fed up with the game constantly stopping for no reason. I will be in the middle of a puzzle and I'll be ahead, and of course the game will stop and I'll have to reload the game, travel back the to area on the map where I was, and then start over.  I have a kindle fire and my husband has an iPad. He's not dealing with any of this. If I could get a refund I would. Get an update and FIX THIS!!! If I wanted to spend $3.99 on a headache, I would give my ex the money

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|one of the best movies' very thought provoking movie. makes you wonder how it would have been to live in that era
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Although I love DeMille's first person narratives, and have loved the previous John Corey's, I must admit that I think &#34;John&#34; has about lived out his adventures.  It was fast moving and very funny in spots, but I found it to be rather &#34;tired&#34;.  Maybe it's time for a new character.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved how the story started and how she refused his contract, and how they continued the relationship, learning about and from each other ... I think it was a little cheesy how she ended up getting him to marry her ... predictable.

B004LP601S|5.0|I am in love with Panic!, so when a seller lists the condition of a product, I take him or her at their absolute and literal word. So, what did I receive?<br /><br />Exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />The CD looked brand new, with no visible scuffs or marks. It arrived within a week-and-a-half, which was well within the window of receipt. I popped in my laptop, and it played with no problems.<br /><br />Plus, the CD is easily an all-time favorite! A great purchase.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|Here there be spoilers. Dark Knight Rises: too vehicletastic. He drives a batcycle, he flies a batcopter -- the real Batman is just a man, a man with hermetic assassin training and a utility belt, but a man. When Batman has to use his batcopter to haul a neutron bomb out \\"over the bay\\" away from the city I feel like I'm watching a James Bond movie, not Batman. Batman is a detective. He uses his wits to catch these guys, not his expensive toys. This Batman farmed all his detecting out to Alfred. This Batman couldn't even figure out that Miranda Tate was not all she seemed! Never trust a French chanteuse. Who haunted the dreams of that boiled owl in Inception. I'll meet halfway on suspension of disbelief. That's why I'm in the theatre. But the halfway part . . . If you don't show up at the meeting place, and I have to go across town and over to your house, and you don't answer the door, and I let myself in and there's some Hans Zimmer on the stereo and the bathroom window's open and you've written in steam on the mirror SCREW YOU . . . I don't know. Okay, so Bane broke Batman's back and had him shipped out to the Moorish prison hole of his past. But when a helpful fellow prisoner explains \\"You won't be able to move until I fix your back . . . Your vertebra is sticking out . . .\\" and punches it back into place . . . leading to a complete recovery . . . again, I don't know.<br /><br />Nolan seems to have trouble structuring his stories. Toward the end of a long film is not where one wants a protagonist defeat-imprisonment-recovery-escape sequence. If you've gotta have that, it could come at the end of act one. Or, heaven forbid, defeat-imprisonment at the end of the film, and recovery-escape at the top of Dark Knight Rises: The Final Chapter. (Inception, too, seemed to stumble about like a drunk in the video store.) Don't like Anne Hathaway and don't like Catwoman's mood-killing postmodern quips. Get Eartha Kitt to do it digitally like Brando in Superman Returns. In three of these Nolan Batmans there's never been a decent female character for Batman to play off of. The vanishing Katie Holmes, the game Maggie Gyllenhaal -- he just didn't write anything for em to do. I must not have been completely under the spell of the film, because when the batcopter, on its way out to the bay, hoists that bomb over a school bus full of orphans (and the bland Joseph Gordon-Levitt) I was thinking \\"How great would it be if that bomb slammed into that bus like a wrecking ball?\\" Sadly, it was not to be.<br /><br />The movie lurched up to the brink of an interesting idea -- what if Batman lost all his money -- and then wobbled away in some other narrative precession. Rather than showing us Batman surviving on his own, defeating Bane without his pricey hardware -- the real Batman -- Nolan hurriedly got him back into the copter. I would have liked to have seen that other movie, with broke street Batman. I guess since losing his parents Bruce Wayne has used his money to insulate himself, with the suit, the copter -- but that would be a theme for a movie with something on its mind. Dark Knight Rises feints toward political content, but merely uses the motif of class uprising as another exotic/gritty backdrop in a bloated action movie. The film is uninterested in exploring any of the questions it raises. Hell, it's uninterested in raising any questions. Of course this is the director who made a 148 minute film about dreams without a single memorable image or surreal moment. (It only felt like 192 minutes). In fact in Nolan's career I can remember exactly one image: Carrie Ann Moss' look of absolute evil, sitting in the car toward the end of Memento.ee of these Nolan Batmans there's never been a decent female character for Batman to play off of.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Great story covering many generations of a family.  Unexpected twist at the end!!  I have already recommended it several times.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have read all of the comics (graphic novel) that this is based on and although it only roughly follows that it is super cool in it's own way.  I love it and hope rumors of this being the last season are just that, rumors, because I want more and more and more!!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I was a big fan of 24 and this one has me pretty hooked too!  I've been telling everyone to watch.  Um, remember it was on Showtime though, so there is nudity, a little bit in each episode I've watched so far... 5
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I was in the market for this exact set when Amazon sent me a notification via the gold box.  I ordered in seconds.  The low price was impossible to pass up.  Great box set and of course the movies are fantastic.
B0001I562I|5.0|This was a very fun movie and still is today.  The film itself was very grainy at the beginning.  You could tell that there was something crawling on the camera lens.  I don't know if there would be any difference if it was transferred to Blu-ray, but as a movie buff, I would still like to see that happen.<br /><br />Overall, Flight of the Navigator was funny, adventurous, and mind bending for any kid and/or adult out there.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this series and could not wait to get a hold of this season. If you are a fan of the show you have to keep watching! (Note to buyers: I only buy the seasons though when they are on sale).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is amazing and it will provide you with tons of hours of fun.I stayed up all night playing it. its so worth it
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I am biased I love Veronica Mars (or VM as I call it). I was hooked from Season 1 and although some critics didn't like Season 3 I really enjoyed it. It is different from the first two seasons because now she is in college and acts and solves mysteries differently. If you are a true fan it has great clips at the end and potential trailers for a Fourth Season which sadly never happened.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch is like an old friend.  I respect his tenacity and dedication to victims. Quick read but thoroughly engrossing.
0634022296|5.0|This has all The Beatles songs and is written well enough that even an amateur can play along. If you like The Beatles, their music, or are looking for some good guitar songs this is the book for you.
0312370849|4.0|It helped me with understanding the movie and distinguishing the characters and their relationship to each other. Would like to see the movie again.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A thoroughly comprehensive examination of the impact of Nazi Germany, Soviet Communism and allied responses through various characters make this book a fascinating read.

And in fact, within the game itself they are referred to as \\"balls\\".<br /><br />Play this enough and you can become adept at taking out balls by bouncing the shooting ball off the side of the screen.<br /><br />The music and sound effects get old quickly, but you can disable them from the main screen.<br /><br />Strangely, the vibration settings are in a somewhat obscure location.  They are located on the dialog that pops up when you tap the back button.<br /><br />I wish this was also on the main screen.<br /><br />This is my only gripe with this game (and it's rather minor).<br /><br />The game is rarely updated, but it's been bug-free since I got it a year ago.<br /><br />I love this game! Get it!

B003W16T9K|3.0|Although many of my favorite individual Schubert symphonic recordings are modern big-band ones -- Bernstein's renditions of Nos. 8 and 9, for instance -- my top complete cycles are almost all period instrument affairs: Those conducted by Goodman, Immerseel and Bruggen, with Harnoncourt's Royal Concertgebouw set being the modern instrument exception. Though they employ modern instruments, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe often play with period sensibilities in mind, and as a smaller ensemble offer clarity in abundance. The earlier symphonies are rendered with brightness, agility and sufficient verve. On the other hand, the two mature works -- those Nos. 8 and 9 -- somehow seem to me to lack serious bite. Abbado and his forces play competently, but without sufficient edge. In passing, let me mention that this set does include Joseph Joachim's uninspired orchestration of the Grand Duo, which is not that much of an inducement no matter who is performing it. In conclusion, if you're looking for a modern instrument Schubert cycle that is agile in the early going but doesn't drop the ball at the end, I'd suggest Harnoncourt; if you incline toward period performance, then Goodman would be my top pick.
B000ID3E9S|5.0|Great movie!  I've watched it like 50 times no joke love the acting and the twisted part about it plus very entertaining
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game, for free, it's great. I would't mind if the cards were a little larger. All in all, It is a good game.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I always wait for the next Harry Bosch story. I always wait for the next story to be better, more exciting, more emotionally involved. The formula is always the same, Harry gets a case, the case is not what it is expected to be, Harry gets in trouble with his superiors, Harry has partner issues, Harry has relationship issues, Harry solves the case. So I am left wanting for more and will wait until the next Harry Bosch Novel is published, I will buy it, read it and be left disappointed again.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Any self-respecting person with a conscience who has done the research and studied the evidence and knows the facts also knows the truth about 9/11. The camera lens doesn't lie. Great film for it's historical accuracy![[ASIN:B000SINT52 Fahrenheit 9/11]]
B0076DELIG|5.0|Mr Connelly has developed a wonderful character in Harry Bosch. I enjoyed this novel as much as the ones before and I anxiously await the next new one of the series.
B002N7P23I|1.0|Low-budget shaky-cam style like this is supposed to make up for in realism what it loses in production value. But that realism is robbed by the choice to dub this movie in English rather than use subtitles. The voice over acting is truly horrible with the voice over actress for the female lead being an exceptionally bad actor.  If they'd left the original sound effects, ambient noise, and dialogue it would likely be different but as it is with this cheap horrible voice over, it renders the movie unwatchable.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I'm assuming that most people considering buying this book have read previous Michael Connelly novels so all I'll say to them is 'you won't be disappointed.'  Connelly has come up with a major plot line that is inventive and captivating and weaves it around the usual plot lines concerning Harry's continuing struggles with the LAPD bureaucracy, including a supervisor who is all too familiar to anyone who has ever worked in such surroundings.<br />For those of you who have never read Connelly, don't start with this one.  Go back to the beginning with &#34;The Black Echo&#34; which introduces us to Hieronymus Bosch.  Actually my first Connelly novel was &#34;The Poet,&#34; not a Bosch story, but one which comes up again in further Bosch novels.  However, where ever you start with Connelly, if you respect good, taut writing and great stories, you be hooked like the rest of us.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love puzzles so this was a no brainer.  Great picture, awesome detail.  Would like to be able to use my own pictures or perhaps more pieces.
B005LAII94|1.0|An old white man trying to regain his youth. What does he do? Make a movie like \\"Savages.\\" If your idea of fun is watching dumb white guys smoke reefer and have three-way sex with a blonde woman with an I.Q. of 50, then watch machete-weilding Mexicans chop up unsuspecting victims, this is for you. The film drones on until you sink into a slow stupor. Along the way you are treated to such brilliant dialogue as that quoted in the title of my review, and endless, endless scenes of bong smoking and unbelievably embarrassing shots of POOR PEOPLE WITH CANCER LINING UP TO THEIR MARY JANE (just in case you dared think for a second that marijuana shouldn't be legalized) and, even more outrageously embarrassing, scenes of one of the dealers setting up SCHOOLS AND CHARITIES FOR POOR BLACKS - all with money made by selling drugs! As I say, this is a film you'd have to be stoned to think is any good. It is simply a waste of time, and totally degrading and embarrassing to watch. And this is from someone who thought Scarface was one of the 10 great films ever made.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|The action scenes are what make it, and of course Jane Paula Patton. Let's see more of her in action roles. While I like Simon Peggy in comedy roles, I think this is ill suited casting. Goofiness doesn't add to the plot or the character
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I never new I loved the sound of a Cello until I had seen Steven Sharp play in their videos on Facebook.  If you haven't seen their video Cello Wars go to youtube and search for it right now! [...]  Their new video O Come, Emmanuel for Christmas is fantastic. The Cello is haunting, the music is simply beautiful.<br /><br />They are awesome, I had to buy their music, I have this album and Jon Schmidt's Bonus Tracks, Jon is THEE Piano Guy. You will not regret buying it.  I have it playing on my sound system right now.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Tired fist fight between Batman and Bane? It was like watching two homeless guys tire each other out fighting over a park bench, not what you expect for a superhero when every other scene is goons shooting each other.<br />Except for Bane, it seemed like the other actors were phoning it in. While Bane was interesting and the face mask added an initial level of sinister, it seemed to also limit the character.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Instructions on the book are very clear, understandable, and easy to follow. I'm very happy with it. I expect to use it to build my husband books for Kindle.

159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver has done an incredible (and, quite possibly an unpredictable) thing with _The Signal and the Noise_: He has written an extremely good book when he didn't even have to. Nothing is more common than for someone like Silver--a media phenom with a strong platform (his 538 blog) to phone a book in to cash in on his 15 minutes. I have probably read two dozen books in the past five years that do exactly this. But _The Signal and the Noise_ is a much more substantial book than, say, _The Black Swan_ or either of the _Freakonomics_ offerings. It is a wide-ranging, in-depth look at the ways that we are wired to make predictions (and the reasons that these are so often wrong).<br /><br />Silver ranges over a variety of prediction environments: baseball, chess, poker, the stock market, politics, weather, and terrorist attacks to name the most interesting. Throughout it all, he reminds us that human beings are pattern-seeking animals and that we are just as likely to build patterns where none exist as we are to find the correct patterns and harness their predictive capacity. Predictions work best when they are 1) probabilistic (i.e., express a range of possibilities and assign probabilities for each); 2) when they use as much information--both statistical and analytical--as possible; and 3) when they are continually revised to account for new information.<br /><br />As logical as these sound, human nature seems to drive us in three opposite directions: 1) we seek predictions that are definite and can be acted upon (i.e. \\"Obama will beat Romney,\\" or \\"it will rain tomorrow\\"); 2) we gravitate towards methodologies that seem to discover a magic bullet formula that guarantees success; and 3) we feel compelled to stand by our predictions even as they become increasingly unlikely. Seasoned prognosticators play a long game. Under the right circumstances (a poker game, for example), a strategy that produces only a sightly better prediction than random chance can produce huge dividends.<br /><br />Perhaps most surprisingly, Silver is a great writer (or, at least a great explainer). As an English major with very little grounding in statistics, I could still understand everything he said. Even more importantly, his narratives are interesting. Who could have predicted that from America's most famous stat-geek?
B007HACDLK|3.0|It did not hold my interest.  I could put it down and not go back to reading for several days.
144234430X|5.0|This is my first Stephen King book and by god, I am hooked. As other reviewers had already mentioned, I at first wasn't too keen about the book when I read the premise, but then I tried reading the first page...and then 10 pages go by and then I found myself completely pulled in by the story and especially drawn to the main character. This was such an experience to read. The book being so long made it all the more involving. By the time I reached the last page, I was awed by the fact that I had actually finished a book I had thought would take me forever to get through; and I finished with a new-found hunger for more of Stephen King's work. Colorado Kid is on my list next.
B002RUA54W|5.0|A delightful story and master class in deliciously elegant prose. I look forward to reading more books by this author.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Stieg Larsson had amazing talent and, I am sorry he is deceased. This trilogy was intriguing and, very difficult to put down. I wish the author could continue to write as I would follow his books. The trilogly is not to be missed!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What great novel.  Just when you think you know where this plot is going, things change right in the middle.  The surprise ending is nothing that I was thinking.  Brilliant writer.  Only thing about finishing this book,  have to wait for next Grisham book.  I have loved his stories since Killing Time.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I love this game and almost everything about it but I don't like that it doesn't give you that much glue credits throughout the game.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved Bared to you and pre-ordered Reflected In You.. Finished it in one day and felt anger. I was expecting to much more of the characters being together. I wanted to see the love grow, instead I found myself frustrated and angry that they were always apart.  Gideon loves Eva and all you get in this book is poss deception and the pain Eva is feeling.<br />I have pre-ordered the next book and hope for the best, but now I am not so sure. I wanted so much to see them grow together and help each other fix the problems from the past. NOT add to them.<br />The book is good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't nearly as good as Bared to You. I hope things are better in Entwined with You. I hate a trilogy that can't hold up through all the books.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|This movie is hilarious!!! Its not just crude humor but a great satire. One of the few movies where in the end you don't hate cops.

B008VVT51U|5.0|I seen this movie at the show before you could get it on line 3 times! I now own it and also bought 4 more copies for my daughter and my 3 sisters. It has been awhile that I have really enjoyed a movie so much!  Really love this movie!!  The movie is called The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very easy to use.  The interface is User friendly.  Settings and controls provide for hours of enjoyment.  Limited amount of adds that do not take away from the game.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|While it is not a short film, it is compelling and more than just an action movie.  This is probably the first time I've really enjoyed the story line in a super hero film.  Very well done and I'm sure it would have had more accolades had it not been for the extremely unfortunately incident that tied itself to it.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I, like many people, grew up with the Goonies as a favorite. I know almost all the line by heart and I never get tired of this great film. It was never designed to be a high quality epic, so if you are a Lucas fanboy, maybe some of the best parts will go right over your head.<br /><br />A great movie for kids as the humor is dorky kid stuff and nothing vulgar or really offensive, my 6 year old has been watching this for years.<br /><br />A movie about ordinary kids, the rejects i fact, who stumble on the adventure of a lifetime! Enjoy! Its free if you stream it on Prime, so add it to the watchlist and turn it on when you have nothing else to do.

B000069KE0|5.0|BALLET FOR A GIRL IN BUCHANaN-This sprawling 7 song cycle is enough reason to plop down yer $3.99 for this. The following seven songs make it up:<br />1.\\"Make Me Smile\\" (3:32)<br />2.\\"So Much to Say, So Much to Give\\" (1:04)Check out da heavy metal guitar riff on this one!<br />3.\\"Anxiety's Moment\\" (1:00)<br />4.\\"West Virginia Fantasies\\" (1:34)<br />5.\\"Colour My World\\" (2:58)<br />6.\\"To Be Free\\" (1:21)<br />7.\\"Now More Than Ever (1:27)<br /> Also, there's, Fancy Colors (the only song Chicago wrote about \\"higher states of conscious\\") and the classic 25 or 624. Terry Kath's blistering guitarwork sounds great throughout. Danny Seraphine's drumming is stellar as always. Although CTA, the debut, is just a little bit better and more of a groundbreaking work, \\"Chicago II\\" with the great Terry Kath at the height of his powers, is well worth the price of admission.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|It's a fun puzzle though the music is a bit irritating. Always good to have a mind diversion and this just that..
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys beautifully combine contemporary music with classical! The fact that most of their music has no lyrics, so this does not limit the room for interpretation or use of the music in various situations! They are clearly passionate about their music, which is shown by the amount of detail and effort put into each of their songs and music videos.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008XX6J4C The Piano Guys]]

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Or at least it felt like it was.  You are actually reading two books in one here: an extremely detailed vampire love story and a pretty exciting thriller about magic and vampires and such.  When I say extremely detailed, I mean that things are described over and over and over again.  Get ready to read the description of what stuff (the main male character especially)smells like for about 100 pages.  The idea of the story is good and the universe she creates has a lot of potential but the over description really makes this book a chore to read through.  I will not be reading the next book in the trilogy because of reviews claiming that it's more of the same.  All in all not a bad book just not my taste.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn did an excellent job of bring the characters to life and showing their human faults and weaknesses.  I especially loved that the ending was not predictable but at the same time was the reaction we often see from other human beings.
B0046B4VXQ|5.0|This movie still creeped me out after all of these years.  Nice to see it again; one of my favorites.
B006TTC54A|5.0|So glad I found this on Amazon! I couldn't find it in stores around me and didn't want to have to travel an hour away to find it.  It was a great price and can't wait for my man to get it for Christmas! He just previously bought an old cop car. So, he will think this is funny!
B001EYU1VO|3.0|Doesn't properly fit the hand of a left handed user properly but it is accurate. Not really configurable to a left handed user.
B005DN5BE4|4.0|The movie was great, thought provoking and good storytelling. It may seem like an over-simplification to some but I think it's right in line with Spielberg's story telling style and it was Condensed/simplified as needed for the format of the medium. The imagery was powerful. It had some fun moments for those interested in languages and issues that surface with interpretation and working with interpreters.<br />I had some trouble with the streaming rental on my Roku player, it kept skipping, getting stuck and crashed twice. After rebooting I had some stuttering on playback but it eventually stopped.  I'm not sure if the problem was on Amazon's end or my end but though it was worth mentioning in case others are having these issues. It is only my second rental experience with Amazon, the first time was just fine.

Hers broke after having it over a month and a half. She contacted lifeproof and gave them the seriel # inside the case and the lady told her she was sorry to inform her that her lifeproof case was in fact a FAKE.<br />They recommended that we contact who we purchased it from to see what they would do. We are now waiting to see what will be done. My advice is if you are purchasing a lifeproof case do it directly from lifeproof website.

B005F96URI|4.0|Bunraku(released Sept/10)stars Josh Hartnett as The Drifter,Woody Harrelson as a Bartender,Gackt as Yoshi,a swordsman from Japan, Kevin McKidd as Killer No. 2,Ron Perlman as Nicola \\"the Woodcutter\\",Demi Moore as Alexandra,and many others.It is a talented cast in one heck of a stylized film that is allegorical and cliched to the max.But the film knows its allegorical properties and cliches and confronts and embraces them every step of the way.Bunraku of course is an ancient form of Japanese puppetry,and there is much of its essence in this movie also.<br />The story is one set in a future where anything that shoots a bullet is outlawed.Man has reverted to using swords,axes and other such instruments to kill his fellow man with.Perlman is Nicola,the most powerful man east of the Atlantic.He has a total of nine underlings who do his dirty work for him,McKidd being his #2 man.Nicola also has a courtesan in the form of Moore,who long ago became his own when she had the life of her then lover,Harrelson,spared in exchange for a life time of servitude to him.Harrelson is a bartender now.<br />Into this climate walks a drifter/loner in the form of Hartnett,and a Japanese swordsman(Gackt)called Yoshi.Both are unknown to each other at first,but both have one thing in common and that is to kill Perlman.Both of their fathers were murdered by Perlman years before.Separately they have little luck infiltrating Nicola's rank and file.When they meet at Harrelson's bar they set upon each other.There is no clear winner except their common purpose,and they vow to work together.<br />Through alot of trials and tribulations Harrelson eventually introduces them to a secret but ever growing and training army.Its' leader reveals a secret entrance into Perlman's domain.Hartnett and Gackt make their way through some tough challenges until Gackt confronts Nicola's#2,and Hartnett goes on to challenge the top dog.When the dust finally settles and honours are avenged,both men part company and go their separate ways.<br />As I watched this film I had to make a list of some of the movies that sprang to mind that may have had some influence upon its makers:Batman(the TV show),The Good,The Bad,The Ugly,High Noon,West Side Story,5,000 Fingers of Dr.T.,The Last Samurai,Crouching Tiger-Hidden Dragon,Cool World,anything by Cirque Du Soleil,to name but a few.The Japanese swordsman is named after a Nintendo video game character,of which you will hear such related sounds when the bad guys go down.Hartnett of course is reminiscent of the man with no name Eastwood made popular,and Hartnett stays at the High Noon hotel.Like the Dr Seuss movie \\"5,0000 Fingers...\\",most buildings are just vague representations invoking a dream like quality in the film.Many of the blows on bodies are accompanied with an emphasis in music at the exact moment,harkening back to Batman;the only difference being there are no \\"Pows\\" or \\"Bams\\" on screen.All Japanese spoken is accompanied by English translation vis a vis comic book word balloons.Entire city buildings unfold before us like an opening three dimensional picture book.Some of the choreographed fight sequences are a cross between a Cirque Du Soleil performance and West Side Story.Throw into this every Hong Kong film you may have ever heard about or seen and you will begin to get a glimpse of what this film involves.It is an ultimate film of redemption and revenge and the classic good versus evil dynamic.The major actors of Perlman,Gackt,Hartnett,Harrelson,Moore and McKidd do a bang up job in their respective roles.I can't imagine being the director and having to explain to each actor what their next scene would be about on this baby.There is alot going on and there isn't.This is not a perfect movie by any stretch,but I can dig what the director,producers and writers had in mind and were trying to accomplish in this very ambitious movie.And I would be remiss if I didn't mentioned the constantly changing and always impressive CGI effects.<br/>Technically the movie is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette and cast interviews.<br />All in all a very ambitious and stylistic film.The acting is solid in this cliche ridden flick that embraces those very things that would doom other films very quickly.It is filled with a myriad of movie and television influences and its allegorical nature will not please everyone.While I found it to be less than perfect,it was quirky and differently entertaining none the less.3 1/2-4 stars./>Technically the movie is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette and cast interviews.<br />All in all a very ambitious and stylistic film.The acting

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I reread Jane Eyre every year as I feel it is the most perfectly written story.  This is a most enjoyable movie version. It made the characters more as I interpret them.  For example, Jane is not the most beautiful woman but her character shines through. I own several movie versions of the same novel and I believe this is the best one. The music score enhances each scene by highlighting the moment.  The period costumes were true to the time and not overly done.  If one is not sympatheic to poor Jane when she is sent away to the orphanage, that person is heartless. Her experience there is portrayed as truly horrible as is her life while living with her aunt. Mr. Rochester is suitably cast for the character and appeared bigger than life.  Jane is surprisingly tough for a woman, but when considering she has been raised with very little, one must imagine a girl who is a survivor as our heroine appeared in the movie.  Dame Judith is excellent as the housekeeper, too. I saw this movie on the big sceen before owning it.  It appeared hauntingly beautiful which is lost somewhat on the small sceen; nevertheless, it is outstanding entertainment.
B003LWN8F8|5.0|I like this album, if only it was longer...<br /><br />Marina has such a unique voice and music style, and I find that refreshing. I plan on purchasing her other Album also, because I can't get enough of her creativity.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|The movie is one everyone should have in their personal collection.  The scenery is beautiful as are the costumes.  Sticks to the original novel for the most.  Characters come alive from the written page.  Beautiful soundtract.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|It has been a few years but the Men in Black are back for their 3rd movie. Will Smith (Agent J)and Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) reunite at the sparring duo trying to keep order in the world with our secret resident aliens.<br />I haven't seen the previous MEN IN BLACK films for years but I thought MIB III lack the energy and sparkle of the first two. Tommy Lee Jones seemed tired and maybe that is why they went back in time to have Josh Brolin play a young Agent K. Of course, there was humor in having a middle-aged Josh Brolin say he was 29. Those Men in Black agents don't seem to age well.<br /><br />It is fun to have step back in time to 1969 with all the funky hair and costumes. Hey, who knew Andy Warhol had actually been an agent back then? Funny touch. The film seems to drag on a bit and there just isn't the enthusiasm as in the previous films. Back in 1969 we see that Agent K had a passionate desire for Agent O (Emma Thompson as adult O and Alice Eve and 1969 O) Brolin does a great job of capturing the mannerisms and speech patterns of the older Agent K but the young and older Agent O have no resemblance to each other except for a British accent.<br /><br />Jermaine Clement is delightful and unnerving as the evil Boris the Animal who sets the travel back into time in motion. Boris \\"Don't Call me Animal\\" is pure evil and he may be the one to destroy Agent K and alter the course of history.<br /><br />There is a very special element to MIB III that finally comes to light near the end of the movie. It's worth seeing this poignant and sweet tribute to Agents K and O as a bit of their history is revealed.<br /><br />I have to go back and watch the original MIB. It seems the best to me but maybe because it was the original and so fresh at the time.
B008Q09K2U|1.0|I bought this book for my kindle with excitement having read a number of the author's older books. I am struggling to read it now at 19% through. The character is ridiculous. The supposed wisecracks seem bigoted and tired and the story is going nowhere. I am so disappointed with the book. I am sure the last time I read DeMille there was an interesting, clever and action packed story. None of those elements are present in this book to date.

B000T433CO|5.0|This is such a &#34;feel good&#34; movie! I already had it but my daughter just moved out of the house and I know she'll want to steal this one so I bought myself a backup copy. I could (and have!) watch this movie over & over again!
B005ZBBKHQ|5.0|So great to hear all these albums (how I last had them) again! Thanks to Robert Smith and Co. for producing this set.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I was really excited about viewing this film, but found it to be very disappointing. The film left unanswered questions at the end. Two thumbs down.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|If Quentin Tarantino had been around back in the day and made a western, it would be \\"Once Upon A Time in the West\\".  It would have the same script, same dialogue, same cinematography, same cast, same soundtrack.  It would absolutely be this film.<br /><br />One of the great masterpieces of the twentieth century.
0375507256|5.0|Everything you've heard is true. Stylistically impressive, thematically insightful, and a total page-turner. Don't be put off at the beginning. The first story starts slowly, but things take off with the second story and things continue to build after that.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I kind of put these types of \\"driver\\" kits it one of two categories.  Really nice and solid, or cheap and you wish you never bought.<br /><br />I really like iFixIt's videos (and the production quality of them).  So, I figured I'd cross my fingers and take a chance.<br /><br />This is the good kind.<br /><br />Solid, good quality and a nice selection of useful bits.<br /><br />I'd appreciate a slightly better thought out case.  It was one of the things that gave me pause before I purchased, and if the rest of the set wasn't so well thought out, I'd take away a star for it's \\"almost certainly to break after a couple of uses\\" feel.  Alas, the quality of the driver is so nice, I'm calling it square with 5 stars.  But a higher quality plastic would be a significant improvement and needless oversight.<br /><br />Nice product.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Wish I were there - my brother was and he told me the minute he heard Jason's drums with the beginning of &#34;Good times bad times&#34; he started crying. Ever since my brother and I saw them in Knebworth 79', that band is part of my DNA.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book is written for those who consume information in the digital age, and for those who want to get the most out of their precious reading time, this is high density, high value content that can truly change one's ability and confidence in acquiring new skills beyond just cooking.  Finally, the design of the book also gives credence to the concept of design of a product is just about as important to delivery as the content itself.  Very worth the price!
1938469011|5.0|Currently only about half way through but the book has been a delight to read.  I'm enjoying the back story on hops and the various hop labs that have sprung up in the past century to protect and propagate the hops we use and the ones that have yet to be unlocked.  This book will be a treat for anyone who enjoys the bitterness, flavor and aroma hops add to their drinks and creations.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|This is not a book that can be read as relaxation. It is thoroughly researched and goes beyond the superficial treatment we have become used to over the years. It is also extremely difficult to put down.<br /><br />Every responsible citizen of every country should read this book.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I've never played the real version of slender, but this is SOOO SCARY! The creepiest part was the tv house,I got past it at my first try, but I did it again.when I went to the house, slenderman walked right past me (LOL) and I said slenderman was stupid, and I just randomly died.so now I think slenderman can hear me...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was well told, believable and amazingly informative - plus being a comfort as I get older and closer to that big divide.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|not bad once you get the hang of it but setting the time is  not intuitive<br />the clock is about as good as this opinion poll
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The piano guys are AMAZING.  I have followed Jon Schmidt before he was in the Piano Guys and he was amazing then.  Now you add in a cello and amazing video skills you get Double Amazing.  Check out this cd a \\"Must Buy\\" if you not sure watch the videos on YouTube!
B005P1YCNK|4.0|I found the book to be somewhat text book like.  This was good information that tends to be in so many business growth/self help books.  I will not reread this book cover to cover, but will refer back to it again and again.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Very easy/predictable read.  I wanted to read it because I knew I'd want to see the movie which is going to star Josh Duhmel. Who doesn't love Josh?
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is 20% cooler! I love it so so much. cannot stop playing this :P also cant wait to see more
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Superlatives are inadequate to describe the power and relevance of this small book. Framed in a specific historical reference(The Holocaust), that we all know well, still the significance of human experience, suffering and endurance is deeply accessible to me, here and now in this reality of 21st century catastrophic climate, cultural and geo-political conflicts and swaths of soul-numbing entitlements . . . where we still hunger for meaning.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Awesome but there is some flaws like not being able to make Tnt explode and not being able to collect redstone with a iron pick axe. Otherwise this game is great!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just as good as the first, Bared to you.  Completely LOVED  the second book. Excited about the third book .
B0034G4P8A|5.0|We live in a rural area, 25 miles to nearest town, but the package arrived via UPS exactly when promised, less than two days, and in great condition despite the holiday surge. Our kids loved this movie and will be very happy to have both blue ray and digital copy. I thought it was a little campy but still good family entertainment.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|great end to the trilogy !!! could not stop reading, good thriller, will keep you wanting more.  would recommend to any book lover !!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Do I need to say what has already been said. Wool is amazing. What an thrilling new world Howey took us to. I can't wait to read more.
B006UUK612|5.0|We watched this just recently.  With a 6 and 10 year old who spend all their time on ipads.  And they both still loved it.  Which is really great since all the adults in the room saw it as a kid.  So yes it still will work to entertain the family.  Give it a shot
B007MJSQSK|1.0|Too violent and lacking any kind of character. Couldn't get past the first 15 mins or so. Bland, harsh, eye-candy... seems the norm of late.
B005FISC52|5.0|OH MY GOSH! I love one tree hill soooooo much! I am really glad that I brought this! :) One tree hill!
B007XIC1GI|4.0|Very honest & open book. Sometimes very wrong but also very entertaining! Gave a great outlook on a sometimes private person.
B0086700CM|5.0|Its so fun I love runing for my life. It's a great app. You A good $0.00 app. Buy it.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I downloaded this to my kindle! Great Book! I love to read book that are cheap or free!! Great selction!
B007HACDLK|5.0|It was very hard to put the book down.  Like most of Vince Flynn's books.  Highly recommend it to anyone.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|Very good sound and extremely comfortable. I use these in my studio every day. I also like how sturdy they are. My Shure, while a higher quality (closed) sound, broke where the ear enclosures expand. Great bang for the bucks.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This movie would be great in 3D or Imax, but it doesn't really translate into a good movie on my home television.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love this case!! It was a wonderful addition to my Kindle Fire. So much better than the previous case I had. And the price is phenominal!! A must have for any Kindle Fire!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love games that have that &quot;cute factor&quot; &amp; entertaining challenges so this is a perfect game for me. if you like Kirby epic yarn, cut the rope, world of goo and the like you'll enjoy this game. I've completed all the levels &amp; achievements &amp; I'd love to see more levels!
B004QL7K70|5.0|This is definitely going in the top 5 of my movie collection (550 movies to be exact).This was insane,stupid crazy, i can go on. it is a must see, i can't say anything else, this was OFF THE HOOK!!!!!
0470474874|5.0|Excellent way to learn more about Excel and to have as a reference to use for projects.  I especially like the disc that I loaded the entire manual onto my PC and laptop.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I reluctantly agreed to watch this movie with my six y/o son. I figured it was going to be some weird movie, and yes, it was a little weird at times, but overall, it was actually pretty enjoyable. Nice mix of humor - my son and I were actually laughing out loud at two separate scenes in the movie -  and a good message. I would recommend this one.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|There are not many albums that I can listen to without skipping songs...this is one of the few that I can listen to the whole album and like or love every single song.  The lyrics of the ballads are beautiful, meaningful and poignant and Christina delivers them with so much emotion, I can feel my heart wrenching with every vulnerable and pain-filled note. However, she still manages to bring a message of positivity and strength in most of her songs despite some pretty sad and dark subjects she addresses in these songs.  The fast-paced songs are really fun and makes me want to dance to the beats...this album contains some of her best dance songs she's ever recorded.  Bottom line is this album is amazing, gives me everything I want in music and her voice is of course one of the best voices of her generation and it doesn't disappoint on this album...her vocals are unbeatable here. I don't think any singers out there right now can outsing Christina.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I had played my first Mah Jongg game on my first Kindle. I just recently purchased the new Kindle Fire 8.9 and saw that there was a new Mah Jongg game so I downloaded it. WOW, this one is much harder but the new challenge is welcome.<br /><br />I would definitely promote this version.
B009SCRERI|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie to watch with my granddaughters who are 8 and 9 years old. I would recommend it to those that like Tinkerbe..
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutly love the convience of Amazon instant video and the auto buy for our favorite tv series' to be there when we r ready to watch.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone thinking about the hereafter.  Dr. Alexander 's account of his personal experience is fascinating and believable!  There is quite a bit of science....I skipped over much of this because I don't have a medical background.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Super good read. Fast paced story that you won't want to put down. Easy enough for middle schoolers but a story that adults will like too.
0618918248|4.0|If you are a religious, non religious, historian, or just want an intellectual read this book is for you. It is fun, witty and chalked full of valid arguments to debate, exemplify and destroy religious practice.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|A wonderful collection of music for fans of The Doctor...esp Ten & Rose!! Murray Gold's beautiful themes & powerful orchestrations are gorgeous all on their own, but it is great fun & quite moving to have the pieces bring back memories of some of the best adventure & love stories on television...EVER!!
B007FRHZ4A|3.0|This is the third one of these Angry Birds sets I have tested and sadly they all have the same flaws in their design. I was ready to love this game--my kids even more so, they are Angry Birds fanatics--but there are so many frustrating problems in the construction it gets in the way of our enjoyment. The pieces are flimsy and frustrating to work with, and it's just too time consuming to set it up considering how quickly you can then knock it down.
B005I6EU48|5.0|Stunning case that makes me forget I'm holding a Kindle. It's aesthetic beauty comes from the leather with gold print border lining it. Sturdy enough to handle being carried or left in a purse. People think I'm reading a real book. The case looks like a leather bound journal and has a crease inside the front flap for loose papers or notes.
B0013UIUBC|5.0|I love this movie! And with the price, even better!<br />I am a sucker for food and cooking. And this movie has food and cooking!<br />it's also about relationships and family -def something that any family or single looking for love can enjoy and possibly relate.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best books I've read! Hugh Howey surprised me with his excellent writing, three dimensional characters and a plot full of twists and turns that kept me turning the pages almost faster than I could read them. I loved the whole book. The unique story line and the world Howey created were original, interesting and well thought out. I'm looking forward to reading more books in this series. I would highly recommend this book.
1451629192|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing.  I have a one year old daughter so I'm a busy Momma.  Even so, I could not put this down.  It is incredible the things this young lady went through.  To tell her story the way she does is beyond words!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Black and white might not be the best choice for the diary of a wimpy kid books but I still like it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|quality was good enough despite not being in hd.<br /><br />daryl is the best character, hand's down. everyone else sort of makes me a bit angry, but ey! a good watch anyway.
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|We love the snuggle puppy book by this author, so I thought we'd give this  a shot. My 18 month old sat quietly and it kept his attention. She is an author who's books will be read in our home over and over
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|If you have nothing to do I recommend watching this movie. Overall mediocre. Shia Lebouf character was weak. Not his best performance.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|So in love with the Piano Guys music.  It has completely inspired my 8 year old to practice the piano.  He wants to be just like them.  He is also begging for cello lessons after repeatedly listening to Cello Wars (and watching the video on YouTube a bazillion times)!<br />The music is so pleasant and easy to listen to all day long.  Highly recommend it to anyone with ears!
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I recommend this movie for all Katy cat fans! She is a beautiful person inside and out. This movie shows the sacrifices she has had to make to get where she is today. This movie is really fun to watch and colorful.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|its really just yahtzee but you can play with your friends or just a random person. its a really nice time killer.
B0052U59F4|5.0|You can't go wrong with the highly popular series Fifty Shades of Grey.  I am not a huge or fast reader and made it through each of these books in 3 days or less.  I couldn't put them down and have told everyone about them!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|For an album that squeezes a decade’s long career of one of contemporary music’s most prolific artists. “Niel Young Greatest Hits” focuses on material that brought him to the forefront of songwriting and continues with his moving away from acoustic guitar ballads and protest songs to an electric driven sound punctuated by collaborations with his staple Crazy Horse and grunge band Pearl Jam.<br />Young’s work needs no introduction to fans. From early work with Crazy Horse in “Down By the River” and  “Cinnamon Girl” to the live solo “Needle and the Damage Down” written about band mate vocalist and guitarist, the late Danny Whittin (who wrote the Rita Coolidge and Rod Stewart hit “I don’t Want to Talk About It) the album seamlessly transcends to the heavier forceful sound more popular with mainstream radio playlists.<br />Ironically titled “Greatest Hits” it was compiled from radio station requests, fan sites and downloads.<br />For a songwriter that inspired generations, this compilation took this writer by complete surprise in that it highlights Young’s honesty, approach to lyrics, performances and raw recording techniques lost in today’s processed sound environment.<br />A real gem.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Just finished and my heart is still Racing. This book has touched my heart forever. I'm anxious to see what the 2nd book brings. The best book I think I've ever read.
0979019710|5.0|I first heard about Hal's MM program in January '09 when he came to speak at our company's year end banquet. I applied it and noticed my income increase by 3x. It's not just a feel good motivational program, this is a program designed to impact EVERY area of life.. Physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual health.<br /><br />I'm giving a copy to everyone in my family and all my closest friends.<br /><br />Give yourself and family the gift and pick up a couple copies today!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love pinterest! the app is great for kindle fire, great for showcasing all the features that pinterest has to offer and makes them easily accessible on the kindle fire
B009KYXEY6|4.0|The album was amazing, as I've come to expect from anything Lana Del Rey creates, but the album was missing the 3 last songs that were advertised on the re-release of &#34;Born To Die&#34;; not the &#34;Paradise&#34; album.
B00881PPTO|4.0|love kayak and all the options they give you for travel search. this is app is great for kindle fire, its nice being able to check for travel deals wherever I am with my kindle.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie. Very funny. Loved the story and the message behind it. Would highly recommend this movie for all ages.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I mean, it's the Dark Knight Trilogy. On blu-ray. No complaints here! The special features are also great to have!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This is very similar to the apps for the apple products but the newsfeed stops loading completely half way down the page.  I waited about 10 mins and still nothing.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Even with the shifting of events in the timeline, curiously, I couldn't put it down.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I actually loved the first two books but kind of hated the last. There isn't really much I can say without spoiling it for people who haven't read it (and a lot of other people have already written summaries for each individual book), but despite my hatred for Mockingjay, I would still wholeheartedly recommend the trilogy. Great story (until Mockingjay...), great writing, definitely a worthwhile read.
B004RC8NXI|4.0|this movie is great it is funny and i like this movie. i would recommend it to everyone. the reason why i did not give it a five star was because it has moments that are a little boring
B003NHRGSQ|3.0|I loved the first book Shiver, so Linger was on my to read list. I think it should have stayed a single book.<br /><br />Linger by Maggie Stiefvater takes place right after Shiver, and re-introduces us to lovers Grace, and werewolf now \\"cured\\" Sam. This book really is about Isabel, one of Grace's classmates, who finally became Grace's friend at the end of the last book, and a new character, Cole, who has just become a werewolf. Cole is a rock star who wants to forget and so instead of killing himself becomes a wolf. On the sidelines, we have a plot to really learn what is going on with the temperature changes and the fact this causes shifting between human and wolf.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book starts off pretty interesting and then drags a lot in the middle. We have Grace, who has basically taken care of herself for her whole life, suddenly rebel against her very unlikeable parents. The issue here is, we are supposed to side with Grace, and the parents are so unpleasant that this sort of works, but the issue is-- she is acting like a lovesick and hormonal teenager who does need some boundaries. Not many parents let their kids sleep in the same bed as their boyfriends. I really didn't need 100+ pages on this drama, and I almost put the book down for good at that point. Plus, not really into the stereotypical bad boy rocker boy who wants to kill himself. More is revealed almost at the end of the book, but it's too late.<br /><br />Stiefvater can write-- there's no doubt. She has a lyrical tone to her prose that makes me smile at the end of each sentence. Shiver was a wonderful book, but Linger left a lot to be desired. I may skim through the last one just to see what happens, but it's not the top of my list to get to.
B004EPZ070|5.0|this movie is great. i like this movie because it has its good movies. some parts of the movie is boring but its well done. i enjoy this movie overall
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the game spider. This app allows you to play with ease.  Simple and easy access and playing is effortless
B002ZG9968|5.0|this movie is funny and romantic. it has many hilarious parts and the movie overall could be like in real life. the movie is great and i would recommend it to everyone
B00846F1YW|3.0|BUT....... The game crashed at chapter 13.  I turned my kindle off and tried it again and it did it again so I uninstalled it and then after installing it again I had to start at the 1st chapter so I did not want to start over again and just uninstalled it.  Will try and play it again some other time.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Heard \\"Breezeblocks\\" on a local station and knew I had to buy it.  Blown away by their talent.  There is not one song I don't like on this album and that is rare. I do find myself skipping the interludes to get to the next song.  Only wish they were coming to our town on the American leg of their tour.<br /><br />Like Radiohead, their music is cerebral and visceral, however, their sound is all their own.  Really, I have to echo everyone else that says to JUST BUY IT!<br /><br />Excellent debut!
B00992CF6W|5.0|So minecraft pocket edition is one my favorite games to play on my kindle fire. Great game for those who like to build like me.  Guise is a great game.
B00008BXJJ|3.0|I wish i waited for it to hit itunes.  I realiy only purchased for 3 songs.  not a bad collection though
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Big-name actors and actresses pull you in, but it's the story and how it unfolds that keeps your attention.  I will watch it again and again.
B003B02PFO|3.0|We've come to enjoy John Grisham's departure from his usual fare, and this novel is no exception.  Enjoy on a long flight - you can finish it in a couple of hours, and don't expect much.  Kind of like comfort food:  you like it because its familiar.  Just nothing to write home about. Mr. Grisham's writing is resonant with what you'd expect in a movie script...simple, moving the story, a bit heavy-handed character development so that you &#34;get it&#34; at the end.
B005LCECU6|1.0|Please do not buy this!  This is a pirated version of a widely circulated bootleg.  There is an excellent version of this show from the radio station master tapes available free.  Bands like Rush tolerate ROIR collectors because we are not making money off them and we are true fans, but it's products like these, sold for a profit which the band gets no money for, that give the huge majority of law abiding live music collectors a bad name.  Grab this for free and spend the money you saved on an official Rush product.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|It's a movie that you can enjoy with the family. I must say now that I seen it will most likely get the DVD!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Just when you think you've got things figured out, you're wrong again. So many intricate twists and turns in this series that it keeps your interest and holds it every minute. But pay attention otherwise you won't know what's going on. This is a series you have to view from the beginning...you can't just jump into it, but it's so interesting and intriguing, it's a pleasure to do so. I'll admit it...I'm totally addicted.
B0015AARJI|2.0|Controller has a rattling broken plastic sound inside.  The analog pad is extremely sensitive and is almost impossible to use.  I swear these are knock off controllers and not official Sony.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I love cyberpunk and dystopian stories but even with the great reviews of this, I just didn't want to read a parable about the world wasting away while online gaming thrived. I gave in and I am glad I did.  If you grew up in the late 70s or 80s playing computer games you can't help but like the references (some explicit and others nicely subtle) to the origins of modern gaming. Those will pull you in but the allure of the online world will keep you reading.  Setting aside the pure nerd appeal, the writing is enjoyable and the plot is just pure fun.  So, if you are on the fence about reading this you can plan on a great story even if the premise of the book seems too simple.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Purchased for use in our survival packs, this little sharpener makes it easy to keep edge on knife blades of varying kinds. Use it to hone edge of small pen knife and was very please with easy of use and the results. Small size, multiple functions and easy of use all contribute to this being a wise purchase.
034580404X|5.0|Can't wait for the movieto come out.  My wife loved it, and she is still talking about it.  highly recommended!!!!!

B005WUHAX8|1.0|Buyers BEWARE!  If you plan on buying any lifeproof product you are making a bad decision.  Lifeproof has terrible customer service. I am giving 1 star because you cannot give 0. Purchased a pink lifeproof for Christmas for daughter's iPhone 4S. She broke her phone last week and we ended up purchasing an iPhone 5. I asked to switch my case for iPhone 5 case they had none and I asked if I could just switch the case for a boys color to give to my son. The package is completely sealed. Never opened and they refuse to allow a color change at the AT&T store or worse LIFEPROOF themselves.  Any one who has purchased for a family member or friend etc for Christmas you are stuck with the color you chose and LIFEPROOF was extremely unhelpful to deal with. I told them I have 4 new iPhone 5 between my sister and myself and I will not EVER by a product from them with such poor customer service. BUY otter box if you are concerned about good customer service and be very careful if you buy a color you are not sure a family member will like.
0547848412|5.0|I don't care if you see the movie first. The movie does justice to the book, but read the book. It tells a story, then another story, and the final interpretation is as always up to the reader. Beautiful - I read it twice over the years, saw the movie on Thanksgiving eve, and immediately read the book again. If you want to know specifics, there are lots of past reviews to read. I am just one reader telling you to have this book on your shelf. Will it make you believe in God? It will surely make you ask questions.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Without a doubt, this is one of the most beautiful films ever made. This just proves that you don't need a truckload of fancy CGI to create a stunning work of art. The performances are stellar. You can practically feel in your bones how heartbroken the main character is, and his young friend is genuinely innocent and honest in her performance. My only gripe is the little girl's line delivery, half the time I couldn't understand what she was saying and had to turn the subtitles on. Other than that, this movie is amazing, and the fact that it didn't find a larger audience is a sad commentary on the state of our society.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Nolan did an outstanding job with his Batman trilogy. The way he showed the darker side of sacrificing ones self for the greater good was incredible. You truly begin to wonder if everything Bruce sacrificed was for the best. Tom Hardy's potrayal of Bane was nothing short of incredible. You can see the raw power he possesses. You feel truly terrified at the control he has over his underlings and the intelligence behind the mask. There are definitely certain lines that make you shudder and fear Batman is truly lost against this adversary. I enjoyed the way Batman was portrayed as never really being a match for Bane. Even when he returns to Gotham, he only momentarily injures Bane, simply to watch Bane rise again and be ready for more. Also the story line depicting how Robin transitions from Cop to caped crusader is brilliant. One word; that is not often used these days, best describes this movie: Bravo!
B001EN71CW|5.0|This gem of a show is a prime example of what networks should be looking for. It was smart, funny, and had a superb cast. The special features are nice, and Firefly in HD does look good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a fan of the zombie apocalypse story overall. I've read &#34;World War Z&#34; and loved it. I've read the Walking Dead  comic book series also. The thing I love about the TV show is it stays true to the Comic book while changing enough details to make it exciting and new to even those who've read the entire comic book series. It's not very often I find myself yelling at the TV during a show in hopes a character listens. I've had countless discussions about the show with friends and coworkers about what we would've done differently and what we wish Rick and his group would not have done. I absolutely cannot wait to see what happens next.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This is adorable, it is made well, good thick material. It will last a long time. It is not flimsy by any means and does hold its shape well. I like that my daughter can play with her Barbie's and when finished, she can clean up right away....all in one play! Great idea too!
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I am a huge Aerosmith and have been for quite some time. I thinks this is a great album with some gems on it. I am one that usually loves an album with a lot of tracks on them, but I felt this album could use a few less to make it a little more streamlined. I hope the next album don't take another 11 years. Plus, like someone else said, keep writing within the band because those are the best songs in the album.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Wow what a duo, Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were fantastic together in this movie  about growing older and rekindling that spark in their marriage. The acting was superb. I thought the story was very good and relivant and that the two of them made the story real. Very well done!

B0098VXE50|4.0|This movie was a great take on the classic.the cast is wonderful, making the story very real for me. i myself own 3 versions of snow white and will be adding this to the collection soon.
B005LAIIE4|5.0|I took my niece and nephew to see this in theaters.  And though they did enjoy it (my nephew especially) I almost feel like this movie was made for someone like me.  A person who grew up playing 2D video games who can identify every character that appears in the film but also has the more modern shooter games, and it even goes so far as to include technical terms like glitches and bugs.<br /><br />The movie takes kind of a Toy Story approach in that the characters in the video games have their own lives after the lights are turned off at the end of the day.  From the start, we sympathize with what is essentially the villan of a video game, Ralph.  The classic story of \\"I want to be more than I am\\" is presented as Ralph who wants the trophy from a different game, similar to Halo or Call of Duty.  In the end, the moral of the story is that people like us with all of our \\"glitches\\" and imperfections.<br /><br />I just want to say that Ralph wrecking the go-cart is one of the most powerful moments I've seen in a movie, Family movie or not.  Without giving anything away, the scene that follows it brought a tear to my eye.  All of this from a CHILDREN'S MOVIE of all things.<br /><br />I cannot wait for this movie to come to blu ray.  I will be watching it over and over again.
B003D513TQ|5.0|i love emily blunt is this movie, she always is great for serious roles like this. This movie is beautiful filmed and cast perfectly. I love it and i'm so glad i added it to my collection.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Any body who likes music should listen.  they take it to the next leval.  they make it fun, and exciting.
B002NHGG92|5.0|I didn't start watching the vampire diaries until season 2 so i had to buy season 1 to catch up on the story line. love it.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I feel like I must say what a remarkable album this is. How many number one songs can you put on a CD? Rihanna demonstrates her range and is all over the board. Rihanna reminds me of The Beatles, the phases they went through, the creative leaps they took with each album. Rihanna has been a genius for a long time, now she is becoming a legend. I highly recommend this CD and there are some best tracks. Listen for yourself and try to guess how many number one songs will come out of her latest venture.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show!! cant wait for more!!  If you  haven't seen all 3 seasons you are missing out big time !!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This si perfect.  The color is great and it helps keep the kindle safe from my 10 year old.  I would recommend this to any kindle owner
B009NQKPUW|1.0|this movie had alot of potential and then towards the middle just went from good to just really bad... waste of money...
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Book two is a great continuasion of Richard and The Sword of Truth.  You learn so much more about the world he lives in and the end left me wanting more.  I have already purchased the 3rd book in this series and hope it keeps my attention as the Stone of Tears has.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|The PianoGuys are a family favorite, Especially mine.  Their talents are amazing.  I am waiting for more, trying to wait anyway.
B008458O3S|5.0|this is a great game for those who love solving puzzles and don't want any dependence on hand-eye coordination or quick thinking. I love the way it starts out easy and gets progressively harder; teaching you new tricks as you go along. I also like the ability to save several solutions and to clone a solution so you can tinker with it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another gr8 detective novel  by one of the best.As usual, I could not put it down. Michael Connelly had me from the intro to the final word.I have read every one of Michaels books and the only thing I have to complain about is that he will be retiring someday and then what? Maddie Bosch?Thanx for all the exciting hours of reading.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|One of the best Disney animations and my niece and nephew love it and can't have enough of it!  Also, the product was shipped on time and met all my expectations!
B009SQRL4U|3.0|This movie had some entertaining scenes, but it is not one that I would buy or probably even watch again.
B000002L61|5.0|\\"Holy Diver\\" proved Dio could succeed without the Rainbow or Black Sabbath banner. In fact, it was the best album of his career. With his own band, Dio basically combined the epic, medieval imagery of Rainbow with the heavy doom of Sabbath to forge his \\"own\\" sound. Could he follow it up with something on par with the standard he set for himself? A bad second album is often the death knoll for a \\"new\\" band.<br /><br />Well, the answer is a resounding \\"yes\\". There was no \\"sophomore slump\\" for Dio on his second outing under his own name. Dio fans seem to rate \\"Holy Diver\\" over \\"The Last In Line\\" as the best Dio album but I consider them nearly equal when it comes to the LPs as a whole. The only real difference is \\"Last\\" has a few B grade tracks (\\"Breathless\\", \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\") while \\"Diver\\" was straight A's.<br /><br />\\"The Last In Line\\" is in many ways a clone of \\"Holy Diver\\". The line up is the same (Dio, Campbell, Bain, Appice), only with the addition of keyboardist Claude Schnell, who brings a different, if somewhat dated, synth to several tracks. It was Dio's first step towards the pop metal (not to be confused with 'hair metal') of it's followup \\"Sacred Heart\\".  Just like \\"Holy Diver's\\" leading number \\"Stand Up And Shout\\", the first cut  on \\"Line\\" is \\"We Rock\\", another fast fist-pumping headbanger. It even eclipses \\"Shout\\" in sheer force. That's no easy task. It's one of those universal anthems Dio writes to connect with the audience. In concert he used this to it's max. The \\"we\\" is everybody. WE all rock. It's our lifestyle. It's our identity. (One could contrast that to Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\", which is more about the band Queen rocking you. Campbell has some of the fastest fingers in the business as evidenced by the ferocious, breakneck guitar hook, let alone his requisite solo. This cut became a staple of Dio's live gigs for the rest of his life).<br /><br />The title track is definitely one of his absolute best tracks. It opens with a slow melodic intro but the hammer comes slamming down when Dio sings \\"hoooooooooooome!\\" (\\"we are coming.....(brilliant rest) and then Dio roars \\"home\\" in full chest voice followed by the lumbering bass & guitar riffs. \\"We're off to the witch we may never never never come home but the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime\\".  At this point you find yourself running with Ronnie to see the witch. The greatness of Dio's voice was his Freddie Mercury-like ability to hit his high register in full chest voice instead of going nasal (Axel Rose) or shrieking (Rob Halford).<br /><br />Another standout is \\"One Night In The City\\", a midtempo number that briefly tells the tale of a \\"dark child\\" named Johnny and a \\"princess\\" named Sally. Needless to say the good girl was invited by the bad boy to \\"steal away and play the game\\". The lyrics are typically cryptic but it seems to \\"recommend\\" living for the moment or perhaps getting lost in the moment. This was 1984. It didn't sound so daft back then.<br /><br />It's the midpaced, doomy numbers like \\"One Night\\" or \\"Shame On The Night\\" from the preceding LP that really brought out the \\"horns\\" in Dio.<br /><br />Just like \\"Holy Diver\\" the imagery is pure Final Fantasy or D&D fiction. Still, \\"Line\\" doesn't feel quite as cohesive as \\"Diver\\" thanks to a decent but out-of-place \\"breakup song\\" (\\"Eat Your Heart Out\\") and the lyrics of the aforementioned \\"One Night In The City\\". Even the radio-friendly \\"Rainbow In The Dark\\"-clone \\"Mystery\\" doesn't fit seamlessly like \\"Dark\\" did on \\"Holy Diver\\".<br /><br />Now, in retrospect, some would say this is a positive as songs about rainbows, dragons, witches, demons and what have you made Dio a self-parody in time in the minds of some. Dio was hip to the joke as his retro-2002 album \\"Killing The Dragon\\" was a conscious throwback. His lyrics and use of medieval imagery to talk about the struggle of life issues was still fresh at the time. Over the years he's been asked several times why he continued to write in thatstyle. To paraphrase, Ronnie usually said \\"I like to give people some fantasy instead of just writing songs about love stinks or the world is going to sh**\\".<br /><br />While Dio was often a fine lyricist the more important thing about this and the preceding LP is the musicianship. Hungry, aggressive playing by a group like themselves and each other (for awhile). Tight, clean production but hard, heavy with the two elements that separates one band from another. Not to lesson the important of a bassist and drummer to the band but, in metal, there's two things that stand out most and make it or break it with the average non-musician record buyer: A great vocalist (Ronnie James Dio) and a hot metal guitarist (Vivian Campbell). The Dio band had two of the highest caliber. Nevertheless, in order for the album itself to rise to the level of greatness, it has to have the songs.<br /><br />Case in point: The album closes with the \\"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\\" , a slow to mid-paced doomy, number with a crunchy Campbell riff that gives Dio an opportunity to blow you away with his voice. This seven minute track has gone on to be one of the favorites among Dio-philes. It has that epic quality of a Black Sabbath's \\"Heaven Or Hell\\" or Rainbow's \\"Stargazer\\".<br /><br />It's been 28 years since this album was released and it has aged extremely well. Just this week I purchased a 24-Karat Gold remaster while earlier in the year European markets were treated with a Deluxe Edition of \\"The Last In Line\\", which included a bonus disc containing live B-Sides to the singles \\"Mystery\\" & \\"We Rock\\" plus a set of Live At The Pink Pop Festival recorded in 1984.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I enjoy this kind of fantasy film - it is well done and fun. If you enjoy this, get its companion piece the Clash of the Titans.

0439813786|5.0|This is an unusual and delightful book. Ostensibly for children, I enjoyed it more than my daughter! The magic is not so much the tale as how it is told. The book alternates between passages of text and pictures that run like a film's storyboard. The result is the closest I have ever seen a book come to simulating multimedia.<br /><br />It is worth noting that I come to the book having seen the film. As with all book/film scenarios, there are differences between the two. I found the film warmer than the book and, surprisingly, the film filled out the characters a lot more than the book.<br /><br />Why read this? Because it is magical.  It also makes superb bedtime reading with the children due to the pictures and the simple, straight language.
0385344228|5.0|This book was amazing!  I couldn't put it down.  It definitely kept  you guessing until the end.  I would definitely recommend it.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I found this season a lot different from season 1, more graphic and gruesome.  I really enjoyed season 1 because it wasn't overly graphic.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I had a large/huge metal case prior to this purchase, and it would physically hurt me to carry it. This bag is versatile, easy to carry and not heavy/bulky. I'm so happy with this much overdo purchase. The quality is good, a lot of space and zipper compartments. I love the snap straps in the front to really secure the back, helps with my back injury.
1936608898|4.0|There is much information in this book. It does keep your interest!  I would reccommend it to a friend or family member.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The album contains a mixture of familiar pop tunes as well as the famous classics creating a mixture the appease any audience. Reminisce in the nostalgia of film themes (my personal favorite is their Star Wars arrangement) or dance along to a unique yet distinct Paradise by Coldplay in an African style. This compilation of music is like nothing you've heard before yet the roots have you at no point lost or confused. I strongly advise anybody to give the Piano Guys a listen, they are a whole new genre of music that has had me captivated from the beginning.
1613822286|4.0|This is not a book for those who are looking for an easy read. However, it is a great choice for someone trying to take a deeper look inside man. Based on the idea of Vanity Fair presented in John Bunyan's &#34;Pilgrim's Progress&#34;, this Vanity Fair takes place in Europe and follows the lives of both the elite and the destitute. By exhibiting man's true selfishness, it causes one to reflect on themselves and explore the true motives behind their actions.
B005PWPUW6|1.0|Unpacked it, plugged it in, and connected my Toslink on one end and my earphones to the RCA jacks on the other. Nothing!!! Sending it back.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|It was a while before watching this movie because I had heard some negative things about it, including the short review in the description on this page. They were all wrong and I'm glad I watched it. In fact, it is now one of my favorite military movies ever. Now I have a serious bone to pick with the official review on this page.<br /><br />Bret Fetzer's review in the description is entirely inaccurate to the point I question whether he was paying attention to the movie at all. He says it is fantasy due to the perfection of the missions, and all of his points to this are invalid. First he says there are no civilian casualties. So? This reviewer clearly has bias against the military by implying that military missions inevitably have civilian casualties. And technically, lots of non-soldier humans are killed in this movie. Not everyone using a gun is considered a soldier, in terms of war, so there are many dead civilians. His second point is that every sniper takes out their target with a single head shot. First, every sniper? There's one. And any sniper worth anything should be able to hit a non-moving target in the head in one shot, that's the entire point to being a sniper. Second, HE MISSED THE MOVING TARGET. The one situation where he COULD miss, he did. And then your point on exploding heads is completely wrong, none of the heads explode. Simply put, there was nothing \\"fantasy\\" about this movie, in fact that was the point it would seem all along. They wanted it to be less fantasy than other movies.<br /><br />The one thing Bret said was smart of the movie was avoiding setups and dialogue, except that's what they did throughout the movie and in a fashion that was very important to the whole plot. They spent a lot of time showing off the brotherhood they had with one another and how important their relationships with each other and their families was. While I wouldn't call any of the dialogue subtle, it didn't feel forced either. These guys may not be actors, butthat's the entire point. This is real, this stuff happens, and this is how our soldiers feel, act, and live. THAT'S THE POINT TO THE MOVIE. This wasn't just a sincere attempt at showing respect to our military, it was probably the single best film on the subject ever made. I am against war and violence in general, but I admire and am inspired by this movie because of all the things Bret clearly ignored in this movie. Which is most of it, it's obvious he wasn't watching when he reviewed it.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I have been a Batman fan since I was seven.  Loved the comics; loved the Warner TV Version.  The resurgence that began with the 1985 Frank Miller \\"Dark Knight\\" was right on-target for me, as I had just begun a comics & collectibles store in St. Louis.<br /><br />When the 1989 \\"Batman\\" feature hit the screens it was a \\"whole new world\\" for Batmania...and the first film turned out pretty cool.  So did \\"Batman Forever\\", and, \\"The Dark Knight\\" & \\"Batman Begins\\".<br /><br />BUT, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" does not have a solid script, is cluttered with too many characters, AND, is w-a-y too long ! About 20 minutes too long !!<br /><br />After awhile, what started out as exciting action, turned into a boring slam-bang bunch of repeated mayhem...mostly gratuitous<br /><br />PLUS, Tom Hardy, as \\"Bane\\" is a formidable foe...but Batman had tangled with him earlier in \\"Batman & Robin\\"...and that link should have been made for continuity.  Also, Hardy sounded like he was doing a \\"poor man's version\\" of a Sean Connery accent  most of the time.<br /><br />Who stole the show ?  Anne Hathaway was a spectacular, sexy, perfect \\"Catwoman\\".  Loved her in this.  And, Joseph Gordon Levitt's role of \\"John Blake\\" is a far cry from his work on \\"The 3rd Rock From The Sun\\"...he's turned into a solid, excellent performer.  Congrats to both of the  above named !
B008HTQ28K|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the escapism; was sorry when it ended and I had to return to reality.  Great summer beach read.
0738212415|2.0|I just received this in the mail; just glancing through it, I am not impressed.  I can already draw somewhat and suppose I was expecting something with more detail.  I may change my mind and if I do I will revise my rating.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|One of the best films I've seen in a while. Great acting and sets....wonderful directing and script. I got it to see Alisa Lohan at first, but the film itself takes over and gives me another understanding as to why a handful of artists, are worth more than all the crummy, greedy, corrupt, politicians in the world. I love this film, and letting kids see it is great too I think. If you need a good two hours of beauty...this is the film for you..
B007SGM084|5.0|When I began this book series, I was unsure if I would care for it or not.  I was not drawn to the character, Christian, at all.  In fact, I was a little irritated.  However, as I continued the book and started the second, I was drawn into the story and the author's explanation of Christian's behaviors.  Upon finishing the books, I was more than happy to see how the author concluded the series.  It was a wonderful read, but I would only advise this series to be read by the adult reader.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I have no idea what this movie is about. But all the teenager kids gathered around and watched it. It was just what they wanted.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I found this book to be very sweet and entertaining.  It was an easy read and can't wait for the second book in this series to come out.  Even though this book was written to cater to the younger crowd, even this 40 something Mom loved it.
0385535147|1.0|Before reading this book, check out the last page where I quote \\"Research, hardly a priority, was rarely called upon.  Accuracy was not deemed critical.  Long paragraphs of fiction were used to avoid looking up facts.\\"  Need I say more!  This book begins to drag from the first paragraph the authors attempts to add pages smacks you in the face the more you read.  I stopped half way through and skipped to the end; even that came as no surprise.

0823013626|5.0|As usual, all of Donna's books are top quality.  Her ideas really get the imagination going.  Try this, and any others she has written.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I was cruising through this series until I hit Feast for Crows. For some reason Martin decided to mix things up with this book; he changed the character focus, the flow of the book, the timelines, etc. I enjoyed the story, but I felt like the tempo was completely off and it took a while to focus on the story rather than where Martin was going with the series. I would still recommend the book and definitely the series, but be warned it just feels different.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is the first author that I cannot put down his novels. I am halfway done with this one as of this writing. It is absolutely riviting I highly recommend it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Ive a<br />lready seeen allthe prett  littl  liars and  ireally liked them. I just finished the first book in the series,and its pretty much the first epise  ofthe show. The show skilsa lot of A notes, and they have the appearences of the characters completely backwards.<br /><br />I definetly suggest readingthe books first, and then watch theshows. But overall, it was a really good boom and i cant  waittostart  readingthe next one, even though i already know exactly whats going to happen.

0547884591|3.0|Some good ideas, but too much dirty language and too much talk about sex for a cookbook.  There was absolutely NO need for that. Now I bought the most expensive cookbook I have ever bought, and one that I cannot use around friends, family, children, coworkers, or anyone. I had to copy the few recipes I will be trying out so as not to be reading  that garbage all the time. No, I am not being \\"prude\\", but I was taught \\"garbage in; garbage out\\".  I feel like I spent too much money for some good recipes. Sorry, but I am disappointed. This could have been a very good book. Colors are great. Quality is great.  Some good cooking tips.  Just content could have been better. If you are just looking for a good cookbook and nothing else, this probably isn't it.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The Dark Knight put me on edge but this movie did not deliver on creepiness like I hoped.  Barring that and the gaping plot holes I liked the allusion to the resurrection of Jesus Christ in this movie. Batman=Christ. Catwoman=Judas.  Bane=Satan.
030758836X|1.0|If I had testicles they would be blue. Characters were annoying, plot left a lot to be desired and the ending was lackluster and hard to swallow. I wanted to stop reading this book so many times but kept on just to see if ANY of the characters would get what was coming to them. But no, didn't happen and regret not putting the book down after the first few chapters.

1439152802|5.0|OH WOW!!! These were my very first words when I opened the mailbox and saw the beautiful cover of this most wonderful read book. And also my last words when I read the last sentence in this most wonderful read book.<br /><br />Author Kate Morton stole my heart, mind and soul while I was immersed within the pages of this historical fiction. Her writing style is so that it makes you not just follow as you would some characters, but I was lost within the pages and lives of each page and character.<br /><br /> If you love mystery, exploring the past to fast the future, then this book, the SECRET KEEPER is the book for you. It would make a wonderful Christmas gift for your favorite mystery reader that is on your list. Also an awesome way to start your reading this coming New Year.<br /><br />So due to the above, I am giving this book a Breath of Life ratings of:<br /><br />Five Clock Rating!!!<br /><br />Disclosure: I did not receive this book for my honest opinion and review. But the opinions are my own and yours may differ.
B002GIBVV6|4.0|It is a gift, so as far as I know it will be fine.  I'll know after Christmas if it is acceptable.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is so fun to listen to.  I play it while my class is doing their writing assignment in the morning.  It has created a relaxing feeling in the classroom.  It's also helps me unwind on the drive home so I'm ready for round two with my own kids.  I would recommend this album to everyone.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|If you like David Garrett you will love this disc.  This is my 4th from him.  The disc titled David Garrett is still the best in my opinion but this is close.  I have also seen him live in concert and puts on a great show.

1451695195|1.0|Since this book is written by a medical professional, I bought it hoping that it would give an objective point of view of near death experiences and life after death. What a huge disappointment the book turned out to be! It is sad to see that a highly trained and apparently smart physician handles the subject matter so poorly.<br /><br />Regardless of one personal beliefs, the topics could have been addressed more objectively and in an engaging manner. Instead the writing seems to be at the level of a high school student and time and time again it feels like the work of a 7th or 8th grade student. Consequently, the book is very hard to read, more for this reason than any other.<br /><br />Besides this, the book seems limited, lacks imagination and the author comes across being narcissistic and self-involved.<br /><br />I am certain that there are many other books on this topic that will inform the reader better and be a good use of time spent.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|good graphics and lots of different boards to choose from make this game very entertaining without getting old.  I like that you can customize and turn on/off music, etc.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|There Will Be Blood follows Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) in his epic quest for riches from miner to oilman. The story is interesting and engaging; I thoroughly enjoyed witnessing Daniel's rise.  The ending of the film was brutal and had an amazing \\"milkshake\\" speech/monologue from Daniel; in fact, There Will Be Blood works off of its engaging dialogue, despite being wordless for the first 10 minutes, which is complimented by the brilliant acting. Daniel Day Lewis shows his versatility and dedication to character with this magnificent performance, while Paul Dano held his own and gave an equally impressive performance; they really worked great together like in the scene where Daniel and Eli first meet, when Daniel is humiliated by Eli as he joins the Church of the Third Revelation, and their final conversation. The cinematography is amazing, the film is shot beautifully. I really enjoyed the music, it matched the epic atmosphere and tone. The performances, cinematography, and music perfectly blend together to immerse you into this world, and I love it.<br /><br />The Bu-Ray has great picture and sound quality. It also has a reversible cover, so you can use the \\"Theatrical Release Poster\\" as your blu-ray cover instead of the cover advertised if you want.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend There Will Be Blood to fans of epic drama films, and fans that can appreciate great acting and cinematography; this isn't an action film, but I thought it was genuinely engaging.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood has strong violence and blood, no sex or nudity.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This one had more action and twists in the story line. I looked forward to every episode! This one had more effects too!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book wraps it all together nicely. Interesting ending. Well written - captures the imagination right through to the end.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Although this dealt with a 20 year old crime the author does an excellent job of keeping the reader and Harry B aligned in solving the crime.  Good read.
1592332803|5.0|I thought my bakaing days were over, but this book has shown me effective ways to make excellent goodies.  Thank you.
B003G4W49C|5.0|What a fantastic book! I read this because I see a movie is being made about it. Sometimes greatness goes unnoticed because of everything else swirling around. I haven't read the other books, but this one certainly makes me want to.  I admit to guessing the ending in advance, but in no way did that detract from how voraciously I read this book. Highly recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator works great and is very easy to use. Big keys and very easy to read as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Despite the fairly disfunctional love story, this is a very compelling novel.  It is easy to get caught up in the characters, and I find myself thinking back over elements of the book several weeks later.  In my opinion, it is much better written than the Shades of Grey trilogy.
B00005A0V0|5.0|This has been very well remastered and is the first album from Caravan with good sonics. Previous efforts were poorly mixed and did not come close. It is amazing how good this sounds next to some of the hash recorded recently.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Typically when an author tries to make characters \\"unique\\" or \\"exciting\\" and \\"interesting\\", what they end up with is weird, unbelievable, two-dimensional atrocities.  While some of Flynn's characters in her debut novel can be described as \\"atrocious\\", it's not because you can't believe in them.<br /><br />In fact, they're real enough to rivet you to the spot and keep your nose buried in the book.<br /><br />The story follows a fairly typical trajectory: character (in this case a reporter) gets sucked into a mystery where she is involved with some of the players (in this case her small home town, including family).  Of course, the character gets sucked in, the implication of blame shifts and turns as we discover more and more about the players.  In this respect, the book is fine.<br /><br />Where it really excels is in the characterization.  I would not believe that I would find such characters: a cutter; a wealthy, self-absorbed matriarch; an out-of-town unwanted \\"cop expert\\"; a bratty set of young girls/siblings - to be so compelling, three-dimensional, and amazing.  If I'd not read some of Flynn's other books, I would've passed on this, because the description of the book centers (as it should) on the characters' idiosyncrasies, and I can't imagine some of the characters described as being anything but unbelievable and laughable.<br /><br />I am wrong.  Flynn does a great job drawing you in, making you believe, and even making them simultaneously sympathetic and repulsive.<br /><br />Bravo.  This is a good book.
B00005A46U|2.0|This album has some interesting moments but is poorly mixed and sounds annoyingly thin and scratchy. I suggest In The Land of Grey and Pink is a better choice.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|As far as a Reacher novel, this has some highlights and low-lights.<br /><br />It delivers the standard Reacher formula.  It entertained me, and served its purpose to feed my fiction consumption machine.  I like the Reacher novels, and I like Lee Child.  It hits the points I expected it to hit.<br /><br />The low points, as others have described, are numerous.  The plot is a little thin and plodding.  The prose is saturated with filler.  The character development is lacking.  Mr. Child usually tries to tread the fine line of delivering to his \\"Reacher formula\\" while keeping things interesting/unique/different, and this time falls short in this formulaic cardboard story.<br /><br />Does this make it *bad*? Nope.  I still enjoyed reading it... but if it gives you any idea, I finished it two days ago and had to peruse the description to remind myself of the story.<br /><br />If you're a Reacher fan, breeze through this one (and you will).  However, if you're not (or are at the end of your rope), you can safely skip this one.
B00004S367|1.0|This album is supposed to be the first of Wonder's 70s classics.  With nary a melody or groove to sink your teeth into, it's the perfect cure for insomnia.  Don't drink coffee when you play it.  All that pent up caffeine energy will just infuriate you.  For a good pick-me-up, get \\"Rags to Rufus\\" by Rufus/Chaka Khan instead.
1451695195|5.0|The most well described and documented near death experience I have read.  Provocative.  The author's experience is very well documented.
1596912863|3.0|This was a quick easy read, but not my favorite book ever.  Some Austen enthusiasts will most likely love it.
B004GBFF5Y|4.0|Watched this movie on a whim and turned out better than what I thought. It is a dark, light-hearted comedy with a happy ending.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another great read in the series.<br />This one looks like a potential conadiate for a motion picture.<br />Waiting now for next one.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Worth watching, true story. Unusual plot but very good story. Will watch it again when on the television on my satellite
B00007GZQI|3.0|Watch the movie, then read the book, you'll notice there's a lot of differences between them both.<br /><br />Peter Sellers isn't wearing any disguises or doing accents, he's just playing this eccentric billionaire who shows his protege/son (Ringo)that everyone has its price, and raises the stakes throughout the film. (The scene at the end happens early on in the book). It does kind of get tiring but still amusing, but it's a 90 minute film, give or take a few minutes.<br /><br />Terry Southern said the \\"Goons\\" took the script over and didn't even bother to read the book, and Southern's writing has to be revisited, esp. if you're a Hunter Thompson geek. There's a reason why Hunter held him in high regard and The Beatles put Southern on the cover of Sgt Pepper. The British spin on American characters doesn't really deviate much from the book.<br /><br />I'm on the fence about whether or not this warrants a remake and an update, because we already see on shows that people will do all sorts of things for money, and put it up on You Tube. But for now, check the film out, forgive some of it being dated, enjoy the music, and get a kick out of that lounge singer!!<br /><br />I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, and I did.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, your missing the best batman movie ever. It is fantastic. Good as the Avenger movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are amazing!  Their music is a refreshing combination of classical and contemporary.  Stephen Sharp Nelson is a master of the cello, and Jon Schmidt's piano skills are superb.  Buy this album!  You won't regret it!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I like all of Michael Connelly's books; it was nice to see Harry's growing relationship with his daughter .. and the dept still out to get him, but Harry still prevails.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Just what I was looking for.  The delivery was prompt.  The price was the most reasonable I could find.  Live long and prosper!  Yeah I said it.....
B007MDB71O|5.0|I hope they make a sequel because this is were Star Wars ideas came from. Great story,special effects read the books those are great as well.
B005MW68RK|5.0|Beth Hart is Sooo amazing & a fantastic pair up with Joe. If you dig Janis, Billy or Lydia, you'll Love Beth. She hits me in the gut & if I had to explain, you wouldn't understand!!! BLUES!!!
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|Bruce Willis is all that has to be said. But the cast of characters that were put in are tremendous,fun,silly and laugh out loud.
B005GYY0GA|5.0|PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! Buy this album - Johnny is on fire! And what can you say about the guests on this? Everything jives...Awesome playing all around.
B000R0CED4|5.0|I gave this to my wife on her birthday and she loved it. It's funny how the frog looks when it's full. It has a happy face because you have a lot of change. Awesome!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wow!  This was an amazing memoir in two ways:  The actual descriptions of the Pacific Rim Trail with all the problems and beauty experienced, plus how it turned Cheryl's life around.  The smilies and connections were so well written.  The people she met along the trail were wonderful people and were part of Cheryl's 'Uh-ohh moments'.  They drove her to continue on when she was so tired, hungry, beat and cold.<br /><br />At first I thought it was more of a women's book, but by the time I finished I told my husband he had to read it as well.  The message to me is empowerment for not only women but for all mankind, young or old.  And that we are in a crazy world with no time in the 'present' to be in solitude in the natural world--which is not natural.  With no cell phones, computers, etc. life is raw and we need to embrace that.  TIME TO NOTICE TO BIG PICTURE OF LIFE!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Wonderful movie. Going into the theater to see it on opening night I had some doubts. Casino Royale was phenomenal, but Quantum of Solace felt very slow in my opinion, so what would that make this one? I quickly found that this is a new classic. Craig's Bond is both brutal and believable which is what I think Fleming had in mind when he created the character. Great throwback scenes, and a story that just feels like one of the great classic bonds that we learned to love take it over the top.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Nice book I liked it so much. It is the best in the series I hope that they make more
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Great movie. The actors were a perfect fit. I love how it related to how people thought in the past.
B000IVW25M|3.0|I find this issue of Snow White lacking in picture quality and sound. It was released about 10 years ago. I strongly advise buying the newer more recent release of this movie. Snow White is still a classic. Happy Viewing!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Haven't seen the last movie yet, but Amazon really had this at a phenomenal price!  So I got this collection for my husband for Christmas and I'm sure he'll be pleased.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I had heard so many good things about this novel before I started reading it. Everything good I had heard about it is true! I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, the characters, the history (although some of the history got a bit dense), the suspense, the emotions... Hugo did an amazing job at reaching every human emotion one could encounter in a time transformation. This is not just a story about France, it is a story about being human and having human convictions, about being strong and encountering temptations and resistance. About fighting for what is right and staying strong in the midst of chaos.<br /><br />This is the first full-length novel I've read on the kindle. It was a good experience, especially considering I could look up every word I didn't know in the Oxford Dictionary. Loved it!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great artwork, great message, great lil story.  It will be a hit at Christmas.  My daughter will enjoy receiving this.
B0090EJR1K|2.0|This movie was just what I expected. sort of funny, and took a little over an hour to watch. It's a bargain at half the price.<br /><br />enjoy.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|If you're a fan, no review is needed.  You simply like it or not, but the price I can comment on was pretty decent.
030758836X|5.0|Enjoyed the book....I got the book quickly....It kept me going and never dull...I have since passed it along to a friend and she loves it so much that it is going on day 3 and is almost done reading the book as well.
B005NFJAXU|5.0|Husband asked for this for Christmas.  It's a surprise.  I think he'll love it.  The box in the picture made me think it's a big box, but it's not, which I was glas b/c I don't like big bulky things!  It's a great set for a great price.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was enthralled through all three books; anyone who can write to entertain both 12- and 67-year-olds knows how to tell a story.  And all my wonderings about what was going to happen were satisfied completely with the ending.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|Great movie, good message.  It's got a great cast too.  Perfect for your kids.  I really enjoyed it. You will too.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought this CD after watching videos of the Piano Guys on Youtube. I was concerned about whether I would like the music as much without video, but not to worry. The music is even BETTER. I listen to it while running, and it makes me run faster. I put it on in the car, and the kids love it. I've had it in the car for only a couple of weeks, and they've memorized the order, start cracking up during \\"Cello Wars,\\" and absolutely love \\"Arwen's Vigil.\\"<br />Can't wait till the next CD comes out!
B007PTJOV0|2.0|I've played better. It's alright. just like mario but with a leprachon. Good time waster I suppose. If you like that sort of thing.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Limited edition  with very poor quality reports from folks who opened up their boxes and listened to it. No investment value, bad gift. A complete hasstle. However the return process was painless. Thank you Amazon for that. Too bad..I would have loved it if it were first quality. bummer
B00886184A|5.0|Finally they remastered I believe 5 of there albums put out between 1970-1975 They sound so much better than before. It is worth replacing your collection.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Our family has already seen this movie before; but we enjoyed it again and again during the Thanksgiving holiday.  My 2-year old grandson even sit through it.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I got the deluxe version from my hubby today and can't stop listening to it.<br />I think Moonshine is so far my very favorite.<br />LOVE this album. :o)
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|\\"Moneyball\\" provides a glimpse into the use of analytics,to gauge player selection, at a time when the Oakland A's became famous for the phenomena that dominates current baseball.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Vince Flynn, everything is good with his writing.  I buy his books as soon as they hit the market
B002JIOOB2|5.0|Love this show. It is just one of those that will suck you in. I absolutely adore this show, and definitely miss it.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|I read this book right after I visited Delft and walked the same streets, visited the Delft Ceramic factory right on the outskirts of this lovely town, stood at the spot that Vermeer stood when he painted his view of Delft.  I spent lovely hours at the Vermeer museum established on the site of the Guild he led, studying copies of the 39 known paintings he left.  (And no originals remain in Delft).<br /><br />This little book gives a plausible account of what might be a possible back-story of his beautiful painting - Girl with a Pear Earring, and I found it totally enjoyable.<br /><br />Highly recommended<br />with the caveat on the next reader walking those beautiful streets of this historic Netherlandish town.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great movie, even without prior knowledge of the Alien movies. Science fiction at it's finest- all audiences will enjoy it
B006M4TBWG|5.0|Big fan of her music since I first saw her perform at age 16 on a English broadcast and like everything in her catalog. So it was noce to hear some songs I had not previously and the covers on this record (e.g.Girl from...) . Side 1 lacks some quality/strength in terms of sound but the other sides sound better and believe they made the right choice in including everything left . Good vinyl pressing, LP size plays at 45 rpms so it takes up 2 record (same as the most recent Foo Fighter's album/Wasting Light)Note that mp3s/free download are *not* included in this one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved the book!  Right up there with Fifty Shades of Grey.....if you like those books, then you will LOVE these as well.  Anxiously awaiting the last one!
B0006GAI6O|5.0|One of those movies I saw a while back and really enjoyed...the price was so reasonable I couldn't resist buying it to see it again!
B000FBJG04|5.0|Such an amazing true story and you become connected with every character during a tumultuous time in our American history.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great game. I couldn't put it down. The length, skill level and story line with a sliver of fear was perfect. I highly recommend.
1589949811|5.0|One of the best solo games. Thematically and mechanically strong, top quality cards and pieces. Only drawback is that it is conceived as an expandable game, so the core game (this box) is not at its best on its own and needs a few expansions to shine.
B000RPCK1U|4.0|DVD is fine, just completeing a collection. Brosnan okay sort of Bond Lite, kept the series alive, but not solid Bond
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is the best book yet I can't wait for the next book but it needs to be longer in some parts
B00913DPW2|5.0|It was tough but not impossible.  A real mix of puzzles, nice story and I didn't get bored... The hints were just that they were hints.  They didn't spell it out for.me... Nice graphics.. My one hint to anyone buying this is some objects don't become available until needed so go back and reexamine rooms....
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is really good and great for children.  Although it does have the option to buy buy extra things you can fix that by putting parental controls on it. Other than that it is a great game!!!!!
B0086HGW42|5.0|All the songs on this bonus track CD are beautifully written.  Love the entire album, especially U.N.I, Small Bump and Gold Rush.
B0086700CM|5.0|BEAT IT IN A DAY ITS THAT ADDICTIVE HOPE THERE IS A SECOND VERSION OF THE GAME IN THE NEAR FUTURE
B001QW8QYS|5.0|This is a story of a soldier of spanish descent who was brought into the Roman aena during Nero's reign.  The story is acted very well and exciting.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series cant wait for the next episode in February. I have watched all 3 seasons so far the episodes can't come fast enough!
0547884591|2.0|I loved The 4-Hour Work Week, I liked The 4-Hour Body, and I dislike The 4-Hour Chef. Tim Ferriss rambles on and on about a multitude of subjects, jumping all over the place with his thoughts, images, charts, etc.. A book about learning, and nothing but learning, would have been very interesting. A book about survival, too. Or one about cooking good food easily and with little equipment. Ferriss goes the farthest in attempting the latter, but I believe he fails miserably. He writes pages and pages about cutting and the like, to the extent that I quickly got bored and did not want to continue reading. Finally, there was something that caught my interest; how to make an excellent cup of coffee. But what is this?!? To make that awesome coffee, I need some kind of fancy equipment that I have never heard about or seen anywhere, which is probably not even available outside of the USA and parts of Europe. Indeed, if I was to follow Ferriss' recommendations, I would end up with a huge closet full of new, expensive stuff - which is precisely what I have been trying to avoid during the past years. The simple fact is that cooking can be made a lot simpler, and that tons of special equipment is not necessary. I suggest that Ferriss stay off the strong tea or coffee, calms down, and creates a more organized, focused and valuable book the next time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Back on top with the Racketeer. I am a fanatic of Grisham's work but I must say-the last two books were unlike his other works-I was able to put them down. This book took me back to the Grisham of old-the style-the plot-the storyline-Grisham at his best. Thank you sir!
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I like Channing but in this movie I thought it was a bit tacky not his best film. Colour of the movie was a bit off.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Much like Mitch Rapp, Vince Flynn never fails to bring it down to earth. I could not stop reading this book. Hard hitting, fast paced, enticing and exciting. Waiting for the next one Vince! Thank you.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Brolin was. Genius... hilarious how they made Boris have a complex where he couldn't stand being call the animal ...nicely done movie
B005I4JG80|5.0|With a very lighthearted writing style, Druckerman highlights the very small differences between French and American parenting that yield huge differences in behavior. I'm so grateful to have found this book. A fun read.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|It is truly hard to resist ANY movie that features the horror-comedic genius of filmdom's greatest dynamic duo: Tim Burton and Johnny Depp!  With Burton's twisted tale of a popular 60's daytime soap, updated to today (complete with hilarious PC references) and Depp's exquisite portrayal of a long dead aristocrat brought back to help wrangle the family business from a seductive competitor (also a reincarnation of another spirit) blends genuine horror and gore with true family ties..........Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a deliciously yet restrained role as the family matriarch, parent of two delightfully detached (from reality) siblings; Helena Bohnam Carter the addicted Therapist aunt and best of all, the incredibly evil Eva Green as  a sexy,seductive business rival with a dark, shadowy secret (beware of the torrid, animalistic love scene!).  Forget the old Barnabas Collins and relish the rapid reparte whenever Johnny and Eva's paths cross..........this is not only a fun popcorn-and soda film but a genuinely dark tale of tortured love, betrayal and family relations as only Mr Burton can concoct!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Where can I join the CDF?  I will qualify soon.  This is like reading a 1970 Heinlein  book but it was written in 2007.
0316069434|5.0|Lordy Bess this is a good book. Michael Connelly is one of a bare handful of great craftsmen writing mystery-thrillers these days. I mean to say - the quality! It's amazing. Looking back over his books, I find Lincoln Lawyer, one of the most soulful and true mysteries of all time (because it's about a man who re-discovers his heart). And then there was Blood Work, simply a wonderful book (ignore the horrible movie in which the plot was mashed by the usual gang of Hollywood idiots). I tell you, every single page of The Black Box held my interest - a tell-sign of a master that separates him from the rest. If you love good, clear writing that doesn't stumble and doesn't fall in love with itself, Michael Connelly is your man.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Super fun and very addicting. Also gets quite hard the further you go along.  Its not your average match 3 game.  But I will have to say that I really love it. Worth the money and it looks great on the kindle.
0763644765|4.0|My son likes this book, and the last couple pages actually crack us up. The only thing I'd want to see differently is a cat and a dog are shown going potty, but it doesn't talk about what mom or dad do. The kid is probably a boy, but it doesn't specify, so this book could be great for a boy or a girl. It doesn't get old, either! (And yes... I've memorized it.)
1423140605|4.0|I love the Percy Jackson series, the Kane Chronicles, and the Heroes of Olympus series. Out of the latter, this is probably my least favorite, although it is still a very good book. To me, the villains just did not seem as big of a threat as they did in other installments, mainly because they are portrayed as distant or crazy/weird. I am glad that Percy's story has continued in this series, because he is really a likeable character, as are his friends. Jason Grace is similar in many ways, but different enough that it's easy to see why these two clashed when they first met. I was glad to see their friendship build throughout this book. If you're looking for a fun, easy read with likeable characters, humor and action, I highly recommend Mark of Athena.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I never get tired of this character.  I have read every book of this author.  I am not a fan of his lawyer books but Harry Bosch books are a must.  I enjoyed the twists and turns this book had and the only negative was the abrupt ending.  The author tied up all the loose ends but I found it .....lets get this ending done so I can write the next book.  Wanted more of his reaction to Hannah after Harry found out who complained.  Perhaps I didn't want it to end.<br />This author and Jo Nesbo are my favourites.....funny how both authors have detectives named HARRY.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Really enjoyed the character development and even though we know what happened during this time period the story brings a human element to historic events.
B001KZG99A|5.0|If you like this kind of movie, this is a great story!  Robert Downey Jr. is an excellent actor, who brings depth to this character.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good read. Really keeps readers interest to the end. Better than some of the recent books and very weel written
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Beautiful story, heart filling and makes you thankful for the love and struggles one has in their own lives. I would read it again just for the feelings
B008MG1E4A|5.0|These men have my respect and prayers.  An intensive and informative read.  Without people of this calibur and dedication our country would be less safe.  Must read!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys music is magical.  Totally worth the $.  I love following them on Facebook and their video's are amazing.  Very uplifting in a world for of chaos.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|this order shipped on time. the price was fair (competitive, i guess)<br />this series is really funny. I can't believe I hadn't seen it before now!
1476712042|5.0|I finished the book in no time at all, once I started reading, it was hard to put down. Great read!
B004F7DSB2|3.0|this is a really good movie! I have seen it several times, and it still entertains me.<br />My order was shipped to me on time, as expected. The dvd was a little scratched, and it skipped in 1 or 2 places, but that's what you get when you buy a used dvd for $3.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I love this movie and have already seen it.  Bought it because we thought it would be something we would like to see again and again.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|This DVD is a fantastic inside look at a ground-breaking, timeless rock group. It really gave me a much more appreciative respect for the talents that these individuals had. Very emotional at times, NEVER boring.
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|I already knew I loved some of the songs from the show. What I like is that with the mix of artists singing you get such a great variety.<br /><br />I was going to just buy Wrong Song which I love and I have replayed on my DVR a few times so that I could listen over and over, but then I decided to listen to a preview of all songs, and there were more that I wanted than I did not.<br /><br />Buried Under - Connie Britton - Love it<br />If I Didn't Know Better - Clare Bowen & Sam Palladio - A Favorite - Haunting and sticks with you<br />Love Like Mine - Hayden Panettiere - Love it<br />No One Will Ever Love You - Connie Britton & Charles Eston - Classic sound - Also Love it<br />Sideshow - Charles Eston - Good again more classic sound (Don Williamsish)<br />Telescope - Hayden Panettiere - Acoustic - Not so much but prefer Radio Mix<br />Telescope - Radio Mix - Hayden Panettiere - Love it<br />Twist of Barbwire - Jonathan Jackson - It is ok - it is an Avery song, and I think he is a little too \\"breathy\\" for my taste, but it is ok<br />Undermine - Hayden Panettiere & Charles Eston - Love it!!!! Replay it alot :)<br />When the Right One Comes Along - Clare Bowen & Sam Palladio - I just love Clare's voice!<br />Wrong Song - Connie & Hayden - Total Female power kick butt song - love to crank in car and bounce along<br /><br />Overall it is a great album, there are only 2 songs I skip over, and it has everything for every mood. When I want reflective I go to If I didn't Know Better, When the Right one Comes Along, if I am looking for classic country I go to - Sideshow & No one Will Ever love you, Female kick butt - Wrong Song :).<br /><br />Great songs and any album I only skip 2 songs on is a 5 - normally it 3 or 4.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I enjoyed the plot, the script, the scenery, the acting, the message.....Great movie for everyone, especially those who don't need super action packed or high tech, just a wholesome movie.
B005WZZRD8|5.0|Seller was great and shipped fast.  great must have for any GAGA fan.  Bought this for my father who is a huge fan of hers for Xmas, and he loved it!!!!!!!
B006YXTRHY|2.0|Usually I am entertained by these movies but I just wanted to fall asleep.  Not a very meaty story line.
B002XZOZQA|4.0|If you like theater you will like Chorus Line.  Was a bit vulgar in places but it is rated for that.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the ending of this trilogy. It was very unpredictable and I couldn't put it down once I picked it up.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Because there weren't 7 stars. (smile)  It was a good movie that I watched over and over again.  I liked everything about the movie.  Would recommend it to all.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Not positive why I love them, but I do! The movies are horrible (but I still watch them), the books are so much better!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love Piano Guys and I love that they made a cd. This will be my favorite stocking stuffer this year!
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Warning this review may contain spoilers not intended to spoil the film but only to point out issues.<br />I really wanted to like this movie.  My girlfriend and I had a movie night and we wanted to watch this but the redbox nearby did not have it.  After renting two other movies I went back and found Brave at the 9pm return deadline :).  We came back and started watching it.  The Pixar film was made with amazing quality as usual.  The hair of the main character Merida was pretty neat to watch when she was a child it was stunning how the Pixar technology works.  The foundation and introduction of the characters was done in an adequate fashion.  Merida was portrayed as rebellious, smart, cunning, athletic, great riding abilities and a marksman with the bow.  It had one big Disney style production of riding through the forest shooting then climbing a mountain and singing in front of a waterfall (Cinematic Fluff).  After a finding out her parents were going to marry her off based on a competition with 3 other tribes.  She fights for herself to stay single.  That was it, that was the last point in the movie where I enjoyed it.  That was the only time the first introduction of the character actually came to fruition.  She stood up for herself and beat the oafs that were presented to her in an archery competition.  From this point forward it was like a new writer took over the films script.<br />Plot twist... Brave become Naive.  This was the last point in the film where Brave becomes an issue, factor, or relevance to the story.  Now she turns into this Naive little stupid girl who gets lost in the forest in a fit of self pity and rage.  A witch that tries to kill her she gives full trust into without considering any consequences gives her a spell.  This spell thus infecting her mother and brothers in such a way that the whole story dies.  It was pathetic.  It was so fantastic in premise that I could barely watch it anymore.  My girlfriend fell asleep during a Disney/Pixar film... really...<br />It wasn't her fault it just went from being a human movie to an animal film and not a very good one.  Long story short... The bears, the witch, the chasing and the bear hatred were all extremes that appears were the only way they could make this a movie.  All suffered from unoriginal thought, predictability, and the fact they made the Heroine so dumb showed the true colors of Disney.  The fact that the \\"Heroine\\" was strong and became such a pathetic child that showed no remorse for her actions, acted out of her own wishes and not considering the feelings of others even after destroying her families lives.  It was just disgusting.<br />I have no idea what the moral of the story was.  Was it the same as it has been with all Disney films of the past?.. Don't trust the witch or was it that you should try to get your way no matter who you hurt in your path and eventually everything will work out when you cause so much destruction in your path.  I don't expect everyone to agree with me on this and I don't really care I just wanted to voice my opinion on one movie what had great visual potential but lacked the moral integrity to even be considered as a Disney classic.  This should have been a straight to DVD film.  In so many ways this actually makes the woman Heroine look absolutely stupid and I think young girls should have a better example to learn by.r film... really...<br />It wasn't her fault it just went from being a human movie to an animal film and not a very good one.

B000QCS9NM|4.0|Fight club was my first Palahniuk book. The bar was set high and he didn't disappoint. Another reviewer called this book good but basically said Palahniuk used the same shtick as other books...I don't know if pompous is the right way to describe that person,but it's the first word that comes to mind.  This was a brilliant, fun book.
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|killer loud and heavy guitar playing by gary moore,on this hendrix tribute cd.still playing at his peak,sounding young and hungry,moore delivers fire breathing versions of hendrix classics.with just bass and drums backing him,the heavy blues power trio thunders.moores vocals get the job done.production and sound quality A-1.73 plus minutes in length,crank start to finish.got a couple of extra copies for my friends.i was sad to hear of his passing.the music will live on.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Bought it mainly as a sleep timer. Tried free version before,however, upgrade to full version just removed adds, nothing else. Cant use my own tracks for sleep timer - just annoying white noise is plaing. Broken expectation to have what I paid for. If no fixing update will uninstall and assume that I lost my money because I cant even find a costumer service to report my problem and get it fixed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written story that keeps you guessing as to what really happened.  In addition, it provokes thoughtful questions to real life circumstances and wether human outcomes are a result of nature vs. nurture.  Great read for a book club because it will create lots of discussion.<br /><br />Very enjoyable.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Light reading fun, in an enjoyably quirky way - an engaging mystery. Suspending some disbelief is helpful, but not necessary.
0316227706|5.0|Loved the pictures in this book.  They are so unique because you don't see pictures very the underwater angle very often.  Some are so cute, some are funny and some are almost scary, but they are all beautiful.
B000002NIW|5.0|d tones make classic music.  they are classic guys.  just straight forward.  we need that in society.  rock n role music at it's best
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|As expected, low price for this great toy. Right on time, lot of fun, my kids are really happy about it, strongly recommended.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I have always wanted to link multiple listeners to the same feed and be able to control the level, this is amazing
159420411X|1.0|I still can't believe that a Kindle is worth more than a hardcover book.  That rankles enough so that I won't buy this, even though I'd very much like to read it.
B000065K6N|5.0|THis movie is magical.  the hero kicks so much butt.  He's tough.  He has a kind and compassionate personality.  He hits on the demon chick and wins her heart.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I thought this was a wonderfully honest film. At the same time it is funny, charming and a must see!
B007CGLRWA|3.0|This movie was hard to watch cause i teach and i can feel the frustrations of the students and teachers
B000MPEIF6|5.0|excellent movie...She is one tuff lady...I am looking forward to her other movies...I heard that they just get better and better.
B004LQI0HE|2.0|This movie was depressing.  I felt like i was in a rainy world of depression.  that is what they probalby shot for though
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I really liked this movie and I first saw the edited verison on a local television program, action packed and awesome
B008S80OU2|3.0|boc is the band i have listened the most for the past 30 years, even though i listen to a lot of different stuff , from ween to cheap trick, from the horrors to the congos from interpol to secret machines, early rainbow & maiden lps , pj harvey , radiohead, hopewell , thin lizzy, black keys qotsa the fixx , motorhead , gaslight anthem , xx, stone roses etc indie metal wave reggae etc,but i always come back to boc, it's a major band , unsung heroes,  i never get enough of their lps  ! beyond the quality of the material , there is something magical i can't really explain .<br />the boxset is nice but a bit cheap : minimum packaging , bonus tracks are few, remastering not really obvious on for exemple cultosaurus erectus & fire of unknown origin. on the 2001 & 2007 remastered issues, there were bonus tracks , booklet were great,  in the boxset there is only a rarities cd and but nothing on the newly remastered cds inside the boxset, no bonus tracks ! the booklet has the minimum information , only a short text of lenny kaye, no additional text from the band members or from sandy pearlman for exemple, a few photos , still far from lavish...<br />the best of broadcasts cd even if the tracks are superb has in itself a low interest as you can get the whole of the concerts sampled on this cds by downloading the 4 concerts...<br />boc was never a big record seller and  as crisis hitting hard the record business,  those i guess are the reasons why we get a cheap boxset because the record company does not expect to sell many of this boxset.<br />the price of the box is reasonable so it is still worth having it, but don't expect too much from it..<br />i personaly would have very much liked a vinyl version of the box set<br />this fantastic & essential band never got the attention & recognition they deserved , think they were too smart & too weird , specialy in the metal world... when they tried to be like the other metal bands , specialy in their last period, those were not their best lps....<br />i would like to thank boc for the constant pleasure i still have listening to their records even the less good ones.<br />i hope they will sell a lot of this box so they will get more and more followers<br />james from france
B008EZVNO0|4.0|Ya know, I was really looking forward to this one comming out , cause I have the original Astral Weeks at home which I love , I wish he would of pronouned the words a little bit more clearer but hey that Van and I'm still, all cool with that still a big Fan
B0061PEAUY|3.0|the only thing really which kept me reading were the perspectives on Alaska. The rest is pretty redundant for readers of this series.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I saw Life of Pi in cinemas in 3D, and WOW!<br /><br />This is truly one of the most beautiful (visually and emotionally) movies of the year. Life of Pi almost equals The Hobbit in vivid, lush, gorgeous cinematography. Everything looks and feels magical! The CGI does nothing but accentuate the film. It accents the story and the human actors, without detracting of distracting from the film (Lucas...Cameron...I'm looking at you!)<br /><br />Yes, the story is hugely dumbed down for the film. This is my only con. Lee cuts out at least 45% of the book, including several storm sequences, a fight between Richard Parker and a Mako shark, another castaway that Pi happens upon, numerous brilliant philosophical musings, and quite a bit off the ending.<br />If I had to choose between them, I would say I liked the book better. But it's impressive that Lee came as far as he did. I would NEVER have thought it possible to film Life of Pi, never!<br /><br />But that is not to detract from the visual magic, the beautiful cinematography, the ground-breaking CGI, the stellar acting (Suraj Sharma, kudos to you. You have a career ahead of you!). I loved Life of Pi. I saw it twice, and turned around the second time to watch the audiences faces during the infamous \\"jump scare\\".<br /><br />Strongest Recommendation for Life of Pi! 4.5 Stars!<br /><br />P.S. Is it coincidence that Life of Pi actually DOES contain a \\"Crouching Tiger\\"...and a hidden tiger?
B008JAG2AA|4.0|It was better than I thought it would be. it was pretty funny with the typical over-the-top pranks and scenes.
B009CPES4I|3.0|When I saw this cast, I immediately created a great movie in my head, but this was not it.  Close but not quite.  Frankly, a bit of a waste of a great - I mean, GREAT - cast.  Too bad.  Worth watching to see these cagey and likable vets do their thing, but keep your expectations under control and you'll not be disappointed.
B0089BSM70|5.0|I always loved this movie. But now, with both the theatrical & TV versions, it has become my favorite over the original. The TV version has all the extra scenes that are cut from the theatrical version, and it makes the movie more coherant. Plus two different commentaries is a nice extra. One from the director, and another from Dick Warlock who played Michael Myers. Both commentaries are great & satisfying. Finally, the extras i have been waiting for including a making of Halloween II, and the deleted scenes that end up in the TV version. Nice clean picture and sound make this a must have!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'd never ordered a Jillian Michaels video before but knew her from Biggest Loser and when 30 Day Shred kept popping up on everybody's lists of best workout videos, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Caveat:  I've only done Day One of Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred at Level I. I'm not in the best of shape but not in the worst either and this was deceptively difficult. Easy moves done enough to make it hard. The few muscles I have have now turned to Jello. Impressive. And only 20 minutes and she keeps you motivated to keep going. Usually I get bored and turn videos off but in this case because nothing was excruciating or contorted or just too slow or boring, I kept on through it.  And about half way in the burn started and my legs were a bit wobbly.<br /><br />This is old school calisthetics and basic gym aerobics put together by a professional in a way that really makes your body work.  Push ups, jumping jacks, crunches, combined with minor weights.  Sounds deceptively simple and easy...but I think that's probably the beauty of it is that it is simple...and seems easy at first...but quickly becomes muscle fatiguing and gets your heart rate going.  And that's all you want in a good workout.<br /><br />I'm excited for Day Two....
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so addictive! It's hard to put it down, I play it on my phone at home and away from home, my grandbaby even play it all the time and she's only 5yrs old. Thanks for giving us another game that's not boring.
B005LAII08|2.0|What a missed opportunity - Pixar could have done so much better.  It's like they went for the lowest common denominator.  Think of great movies like \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\" --- innovative films that don't rely on rehashed ideas from other cliche-ridden movies.  Anything old, these movies reinvent and make new again.  That is what Brave should have been.  Instead we have a movie that should have been called \\"Brother Bear 3.\\"<br /><br />Yes, my kid enjoyed the movie and that is what counts.  But the truly great Pixar films have not been directed simply at kids; they are family films that can be enjoyable for anyone at any age.  I can watch \\"Finding Nemo\\" annually and enjoy it each time.  On the other hand, \\"Brave\\" is a movie I could have done without and will certainly never watch again.  This one just didn't have the Pixar magic we have all come to expect.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was very exciting. I could hardly put them down.Recommend for sure!!!!!!!!!!Might even re- read again. There was lots to keep your interest going!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The piano guys are extremely talented musicians who know how to put their heart and soul into their music. The arrangements are masterful! I love playing this cd on my way to work. It makes the traffic bearable. A Thousand Years is my favorite, and I play it over and over. This is a must buy album!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Continued fascination with World history through the eyes of his characters.  It is eye-opening and well written.  Highly recommended. Can't wait for the next.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This was a great action film. The acting was good and the action was great. Liam Neeson plays a very intelligent action hero who is concerned about his family. Highly recommended!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is a fun book to read.  It incorporates NY detective work on an international scale.  It keeps your attention.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Excellent book. Well written and entertaining as are all his books. I have read all of his books to date.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|My sister recommended this book to me and I am so glad I chose to read it.  My father is currently going through some behavioral changes that almost mirror the experiences of Alice.  To read the insight from the point of view of the Alzheimer's patient is invaluable to those of us who are faced with caring for someone with the illness.  I will recommend it to the rest of my family and to anyone who has questions as to whether their loved ones could possibly be suffering from Alzheimers.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of Grisham's best books since the Firm--I couldn't put it down; definitely worth the read; you won't be sorry
0062075195|4.0|I have never read Lauren Conrad's L.A. Candy series. To be totally honest, I considered them somewhat autobiographical considering Conrad's well-televised history and the concept matter. And, being brutally honest, I never cared much about either show she was on.<br /><br />It was only after I saw my sister-in-law ravenously reading her books that I thought I would give them a try, and I feel like I owe Ms. Conrad an apology. I judged her books based on pre-conceived notions of who she was as a person, and I was wrong. The only reason I'm acknowledging this is because I have a sinking suspicion that I'm not the only person to feel this way.<br /><br />While I doubt this series will win a noble prize, The Fame Game is fun. It's very much a feel-good, don't take things too seriously kind of book. It's very much in the same vein as Gossip Girl, The Lying Game, and Pretty Little Liars. These are all series that have developed a strong fanbase because they are just good, guilty-pleasure fun.<br /><br />I found myself genuinely enjoying Madison and following her exploits throughout the book. Yes, some of the situations were over the top and somewhat ridiculous, but it made me laugh and smile frequently. Conrad has a knack for writing amusing, vivid characters. And I'm a sucker for the exploits of a celebrity-esque world. You have to admit, if ever there was a case to me made for \\"Write what you know,\\" Conrad has that down cold.<br /><br />The writing is a bit green at times, with Conrad having a habit of flat out telling a situation versus letting it unfold before the reader, but that is a thing that comes with time. I have no doubt if I went back and read her first series, I would see quite a bit of growth as a writer.<br /><br />I really hope other people will set aside their preconceptions of this author (and other celebrity authors) and give this book a fair shot. I can admit that had there been an unknown author name attached to this book, I would have more than likely picked this up before now. Shame on me for that. But shame on you if you feel the same way I did and you don't give this book a shot. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.ly picked this up before now. Shame on me for that. But shame on you if you feel the same way I did and you don't give this book a shot. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B005UWGRIC|5.0|This performance by Take That includes Robbie Williams on many of the performances, but there is also plenty of Gary, Howard, Mark and Jason too.  Great show captured in Manchester, with an incredible stage production.  Well worth the money!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My daughter is a huge fan of instrumental music. The piano guys album is fun, entertaining, inspiring, and positively fabulous. If you are looking for something new and enjoyable to listen to this is it.
B008AT71WI|5.0|It was amazing watching the alternate ending :) best video ever! i was so pleased with this dvd on bluray
B005HSL626|1.0|How about no? If I wanted to dice up some fruit, I'd go to my own kitchen and actually be able to eat some of it. Personal preferences aside, there are some issues with this game that I cannot over look, which prompted an immediate uninstallation of this game from my Kindle Fire for me. I've never, and I mean NEVER had a problem with apps before, even on ones that have reviews that it glitches on others' Kindles. This app, however, was full of glitches. It had nothing to do with my Kindle. So why, then, is it so buggy? It has to do with the game constantly wanting me to connect to their gameplay server so that I could share rewards and see leaderboards. Also, the app had far too many ads. I understand that apps that are free need some way to make money, but I have yet to see a free app as pushy about ads as this one. It's too much.<br /><br />Don't bother with this one. You'd have more fun with a plastic knife and some real food.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|I played this on iOS before, but I must say I was disappointed on the graphics.  I have a 720p screen and the graphics were nowhere near being close to taking advantage of my screen.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|Halo has a great potential and plot line for a movie. I wish it had better financing for the making of the movie. Calling this a &#34;web series&#34; is a huge understatement. Considering that a movie about wizard kid &#34;Harry Potter&#34; or a movie with magical ring powers like &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; became block buster movies, there's no reason HALO is less engaging than those titles. HALO has potential of becoming the next &#34;Star Wars&#34; or &#34;Star Trek&#34;.<br /><br />We loved watching this movie as a family. I gave 5 stars, the fifth star is emotional, if it had a full budget it would have been full 5 star movie.
B0098VXE50|5.0|The DVD is in perfect condition and it is quite a lovely film. The kids loved it very much. Thanks!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Sorry, can't tell you much about it, or I'll ruin it.  BUT what I can tell you is: it was awesome, you need to watch it at least twice, and it is tons better in Blu-Ray.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its a good game that reminds me of Sim city. I wish there was more ways to obtain investment points but Its a revenue generating game.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter is awesome.  The end.  Come on folks, it is TWITTER!  You can TWEET! How else will you know that your friend just ate a cheeseburger???
B009DH379C|5.0|Well, I had seen this concert many times before and I actually had the vhs converted version on my compute for a long time!<br />Obviously finding out that this new release does not contain the entire unedited concert was a little disappointing but you have to be realistic! if the original full video does not exist, then what can you do? you gotta be happy with what is available! After all you have to appreciate their work on improving the picture quality which is very nicely done and the results is an enjoyable experience! I personally bought this to have in my collection to show to my new friends who are not very familiar with Queen and the amazing-ness of Freddie Mercury!<br /><br />I would like to ask (beg) the Queen production team to now focus on officially releasing some of the great live performance of Queen in 70's! One of my favorite ones is Live at Hammersmith 1979 which is probably just sitting somewhere in the archives<br />You can add to the list Rainbow '74, Hammersmith '75, Hyde Park '76 and off course Houston'77 which I and a lot of fans believe deserve an official release!
0486475646|5.0|bought this for my daughter since Jane Austen is not the easiest thing to read. Her teacher has Spark Notes and Cliff Notes and all other kinds of Notes, so she makes sure the test questions don't come from info covered in the guides. That wasn't an issue because the guide helped my kiddo understand the story, it wasn't just for cramming. Great study aid, but not great if you don't want to read the book.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|This collection has all the classic Elvis songs and will be great for music during our Elvis Presley weekend breakfast.

B001N4RORE|5.0|This is such a fun movie. I'm really glad that amazon offers it on the kindle. Thank you so much!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Wish I'd read the reviews! This is nothing like the trailer. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but turned out to just be weird. Don't waste your money on this one!
B0053O89IS|5.0|esta es una de mis series favoritas, tengo todas las temporadas y es parte de mi lista de regalos de cumpleaños.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I gave this novel by Michael Connelly a 5 because as with all of his books (which I am reading through the 2nd time) I find them to be exciting, interesting and very, very entertaining.  I wonder what Harry will be doing when he reaches retirement age?
B007XWFZSA|4.0|Quick note - this book has 4.7 out of 5 stars, with 81/101 full 5 star reviews - very high for any book on Amazon. This book was also distributed for a short time for free to the author's email list subscribers, which I also benefited from. I tend to think that many of those high reviews are a directly related to that fact and if you read through, many have little actual comment on the content.<br /><br />That being said, this is a quality book with a lot of useful information to anyone interested in consulting and preparing for a case interview. The author's website (caseinterview.com) also has a good amount of free information about case interviews, application tips, and consulting work/lifestyle. I think it is a great idea to read it thoroughly if you're serious about this kind of work, because it is very competitive and competition can be fierce. But the &#34;secrets&#34; that Cheng claims to have are nothing groundbreaking or new - its the same stuff as in Case in Point and any other case interview book. His approach might be a little more unique and easier to follow, but there isn't much new and it certainly doesn't live up to the absurd claims in the description.<br /><br />Worth the $20? Maybe, as the difference between getting a top tier offer and a mid level firm offer is tens of thousands of dollars. But can you do just fine and rock a BCG, Bain, or McKinsey interview without this book? Of course. Ultimately, whether or not you get the offer is going to depend on: your background, your actual true interest in consulting, and your performance. This book may help your performance in the case interview, but practicing - with current consultants, and with colleagues - is the only way to improve yourself. Having a general understanding of the process and how to approach an issue and frame it is necessary and it will give you that, but its not a magic ticket in.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend. Love the recipes-the quotes-and especially the humorous sections.<br /> Would recommend this to friends.

B008FSCNTK|5.0|I bought this for my wife, who is a big Diana Krall fan and she raves over it so this rating is based on her appreciation of the record.  I haven't had a chance to listen to it because she keeps it in her car.

B005LAJ22Q|4.0|Don't get me wrong... It was a really good season. I guess it just felt slower after everything that went on in season 1. It's a good buy! I recommend it.
B0055SWM08|4.0|A good thinking game. You will waste a lot of time playing quell. If you dont have time to waste dont download this

B0059XTU22|5.0|Just in the door after watching, I repeat watching The Hobbit unexpected Journey,the 10am session at Ascot Cinema Upper Hutt Wellington New Zealand Wednesday 12th Dec on the big screen in 3D not a trailer like the previous reviewer. Now back to the review,was it long as some had suggested, that it was going to be two long only one answer \\"NO\\" if your truly focused on a movie time is not an issue has it finished already, I want to see the next part now\\". The Hobbit is a stand alone movie, if you've never seen the Lord of the Rings for some reason it really doesn't matter. See it for your self and make up your own mind.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Who knew that a pianists and a cellist (and a couple of talented production guys) could put together such an incredible sound? But here it is. If you don't know who these guys are and what their music sounds like just go over to YouTube and watch a couple videos. Chances are the music from those videos will be on this CD. Simple conclusion: you buy the CD.<br /><br />Personal favorites:<br />Somewhere Over the Rainbow / Simple Gifts<br />Code Name Vivaldi<br />Peponi<br />The Cello Song<br /><br />If watching those four videos doesn't convince you to buy this CD then you have very different taste in music than I do.
B000W089XS|5.0|Great! Arrived quickly with no problems. I would definitely recommend this person to others for buying used DVDs. This is one of my favorites!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Amazon needs to get with the damn program. When we're asked to rate products and shows we've purchased there *should be a quick and easy option to just select how ever many stars. We shoud NOT have to write this many damn words in order for a positive or even negative review to be processed. This is absurd and extremely irritating. Amazon is a great website that has certain issues where it's inconvenient and inconsiderate.
B009JBZH54|1.0|I got this as a gift for my wife she is a big batman fan. One of big reason I bought if for is the digital copy. Well talk about a hassle. Still going back and forth with flixter trying to get it to work. Plus you need to make an account for ultraviolet. But wait there is more! It seems that the digital copy won't work are her iPhone or iPad !! Amazon should sell this with a warning label!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl is a tremendous work of fiction. The story was filled with nonstop twists and turns. Admittedly, the ending was not gratifying and was actually the only part of the book I didn't thoroughly enjoy.
B00632HWOG|5.0|needed this app for my new kindle. easy to install and use. a good purchase and cant beat the price
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is the absolute best classical fusion I've ever come across.  Wonderful mix of classic, rock, pop, and a few other things thrown in for good measure.  Most of their pieces can be previewed (full song) on YouTube.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this was a gift to myself for my new kindle hd. easy to install and fun to play .  great app
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This product was very easy to assemble and it's even more fun to use! However, I had to superglue the pen nibs because they fell off easily. I reccommend this to any Doctor Who fan! It's fantastic!
B001XUY818|3.0|Blow doesn't quite blow but it's borderline. OK if you're real bored. Some good moments and it's based on a &#34;true&#34; story???
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I really like the creativity and commitment to the classics.  I am supportive of thee guys getting their name out there solely on the social web.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|A great thrill ride. It picks up right where the first one leaves off and dose not disapoint.  All in all a great film.
0679759328|3.0|This book feels like a throwback to Stendhal or someone like that who basically painted a mood and scene and filled it with gentle internal dialogue. Little happens in this book, but it's real and believable, at least.<br /><br />The basic plotline is that Edith, a spinsterish late-30s novelist (cultured romance novels, basically), goes to a resort in Switzerland to escape the embarrassment of jilting a man at the altar. She is urged on this escape by her best friend and her publisher, who both seem more embarrassed than she. It's the tail end of the summer season, and the resort is nearly empty. As Edith gets to know the few people at the resort, their secrets come out, and Edith is eventually forced to address her own issues. Prodding her most strongly is the one man at the resort, a dashing 50-ish business owner who is the one person who recognized Edith (who writes under a pen name).<br /><br />Edith's past is revealed in pieces through the book, and she has a few surprises --- both her upbringing and her adulthood --- that she's managed to keep hidden from most of her acquaintances. Indeed, she shares none of that information with anyone she meets at the Hotel Du Lac, but only reveals those things in interior dialogue and flashback.<br /><br />While interior monologue drives the book, it would be an exaggeration to say that it's great interior monologue. It's certainly not deep thoughts or sharp observations about humanity. It's better than cliched, but it's not memorable, either. Perhaps the funniest part is that Edith, who presumes that she's good at seeing people's inner lives, is incorrect over and over again when she tries to guess at people's histories or hidden secrets.  I guess this is a metaphor for her being a writer of limited talent and scope.<br /><br />Ultimately, Edith faces a crossroads (won't give away the details), and she makes the decision that seems truest to her nature. In that way, the book is very satisfying, even if it doesn't have a lot in it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I hope there is a movie to follow the incredible journey into the past. I know I will read this book again in a year or two.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Wonderful movie.  I can watch this one with my kids over and over again.  I almost never buy DVDs any more but this one is the exception.  I am buying 2 copies one for myself and one as a gift.
B0086700CM|5.0|A great game, that easy and fun to play. I highly recommend it to everyone. Easily one of, if not the beet free game out there.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Just like the Where's My water series and comes from the same creators.  This is one for the whole family.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I find most of the writers of this genre use the same old predictable formulas .Michael Connelly stands above the rest.His characters are believable and his writing is superb.I recommend this and all his books.Five stars!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great new version of a ground breaking game. the new additions are creative.  the cut scenes are funny.<br /><br />Ad supported games suck battery life.  Giving the developer a few bucks for a good game saves battery life and gets run of annoying adds on your screen.  Absolutely worth the $$
B0018QCXH8|5.0|This movie is another great performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. The man is a genious! The movie is visually stunning and the acting is amazing! One movie you need in your collection!

B003LXSY60|4.0|and listened to a Black Keys album. I definitely enjoy listening to it. Especially during my commute to/from work. Solid album. I hear other albums are a little better, but I enjoy this one. It has encouraged me to get more into The Black Keys.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|Wow, Mitch Albom is the master of fantasy, and even though I know this story is fictional, I'm always left wondering if there is a possibility? When a book makes you feel like that, the author is awesome, which Mitch is.<br /><br />This story follows the lives of Dor, who later becomes Father Time, Sarah and Victor. They couldn't possibly have known how coming from two different worlds, would end up merging in this one.<br /><br />We first meet Dor as a little boy asking questions plentiful of his parents, and frolicking in the grass with his good childhood friends, Alli and Nim. But regardless as to what the other children were doing, Dor was always measuring time. It was his destiny of sorts.<br /><br />When Dor is approached about working on a Tower project with his childhood friend, Nim, who has since been throne the King, he's at a loss for words. The next decision Dor makes takes the reader on a wonderful journey and will cause you to pause and think about how one measures his own time, and is all this time measuring worth it in the end? You will really think with this story! It's not so fictional after all!<br /><br />If you loved The Five People You Meet in Heaven, YOU will be just as captivated by this tale. Wonderfully written, strong characters and just a wholesome good feeling all 'round! Outstanding read! I highly recommend! The ending, as with The Five People, made me cry because I just loved what happened! Mitch knows how to tug at the heartstrings! Simply delightful!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Started a little slow , you must read the Hunger Games book first to understand the concept looking forward to the movie.
B000JU7NCE|5.0|we bought this several years ago and have watched it a few times.  it's always fun to see the cure perform.  arrived quick and in great shape
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham at his best.  While reading a thriller, the reader also learns and appreciates how the legal system works.  The fact that the author is able to weave suspense into a tale set in real places and believable plots is a bonus.  Hard to put this book down.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|very good remake of the remake, the second one made from the classic original 50s sci fi, lots of scary moments and wild effects, one awsome monster movies with a super cool ending...
0553386816|5.0|Do you ever wonder why John Grisham is so popular? Read this book and you will understand. I love John Grisham and he made me proud of that fact after reading this book.

B00AA0TJO8|1.0|I watched the vidio for this app and so I bout it . anyway I start playing it and I notice it doesn't fit my screen. so I spent a dollor for nothing. so don't buy this app on kindle fire. I haven't tried it on the ipad yet. but I will so don't buy this app on the kindle
B009A3NGF4|5.0|What more is there to say about Mumford and Sons except, more! I want more!  They are a spectacular group. I will be always willing to buy their music.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is awesome!  Gritty, realistic (as a zombie themed show can get), extremely violent but not in a cheap way.  watch it if you have the stomach for it though i can't fault you if you don't.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I seen this 2 times in theaters. Chris Nolan did an amazing<br />Job with these movies. Bane (tom hardy) did a awesome job.)
B0043M4OTE|4.0|If you are a fan of the Nightrunner series, this is a must have!  It fills in some gaps that didn't make it into the novels and offers some very nice fan-service.  Overall, very nice!
1608871088|5.0|The artwork in this book is just like the artwork in the movie, absolutely stunning! A must have for anyone who loves collecting Art of books
B003V4AK8E|4.0|Nice and light. feels great in the hands. There are dead spots, but not enough for me to care. Charge holds well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like playing solitaire and this game plays easily.  The  game runs well with regular random deal. I did not try the undo or replay move options. I just kept dealing as I would with cards.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Some will nitpic, but Bane was a great contrast to the Joker and served the final chapter in the trilogy well.
0312427573|5.0|I read it when it first came out and was bogged down in the multi-voiced plot; so much that I skipped most of middle and read the post script. I enjoyed my recent reading so much more, now that bonds and stocks and narcissistic rich folk have become less of a rarity and more commonplace. As before, it is quotable and readable and at times, hilariously funny. I'd vote for it as book of the decade except for the weak ending. Even at that, I'd put it high on the list of Best Books, simply because of its prescience about the coming financial crash.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|I sent this movie to my daughter in college as it's her favorite Christmas movie to watch after studying and during the holidays.  A great surprise for her to get this time of year!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|there were certain words that i needed to know the definition of for a school assignment. But some of those words were not in here. Its a good dictionary  though, for common  unknown words and  just plain common words.
B004XWLN20|1.0|The show itself has been adequately reviewed already.  My one-star rating is for the absolutely terrible packaging.  The 62 DVDs come packed in two book-like containers.  Each \\"page\\" has two DVDs in pockets which hold the disks so tightly that it takes considerable effort to pull one out -- they act as though they were almost glued in the pockets.  Without a doubt, it will take few withdrawals and re-insertions to scratch their surfaces.  To save the disks I had to spend an extra $20 to buy jewel boxes to hold the disks safely.  So be prepared!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is a wonderful story to remind us of the value of appreciating time and making the most of it. I am sharing it widely.
B000002J1U|3.0|I purchased this item &#34;new&#34; but it arrived in the package without the cellophane wrap which leads me to believe it is &#34;used.&#34;<br />I listened to the entire CD and there are no &#34;goofs&#34; or scratches, so no biggie, but...<br />I would have given four stars but because of the error mentioned above I give it three stars.
B0076DELIG|5.0|from the always dependable Michael Connelly - another impossible mystery resolved.  I highly recommend this to any fan of Harry Bosch.
B00004TS0E|5.0|THIS IS MY VERY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS MOVIE.  IT IS TRADITION IN OUR HOUSE TO PLAY THE MOVIE WHILE WE ARE HANGING DECORATIONS - IT IS SWEET AND TOUCHING AND GETS US ALL IN THE SPIRIT OF WE BELIEVE!  I HEARTILY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE - IT IS A FANTASTIC REMAKE SUPREMELY WELL DONE!
B005HSG3VK|1.0|This case was not as expected. It is made of cheap plastic and the piece made to hold up Kindle in an upright position is made of cardboard. One edge of the cardboard is supposed to rest in a groove at the back of the case. The groove is not deep enough to hold it and the whole case falls flat. $24 for a cheap plastic piece with cardboard.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is a real, genuine Sony controller. It works great. What more do you need to know? Would buy again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love that it is always a pull and tap away from quickly getting a full forecast.  It is the most convenient weather app.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|Absolutely awesome CD. The Duet with Blake Shelton is the reason I purchased this CD but have come to love the entire CD. Would definitely be a favorite in my collection!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Charlie writes like how he thinks and talks making it fairly easy to follow. His quiet, observant and emotional state made him relatable and like someone you could be friends with. It was quite touching getting inside Charlie's mind.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is the music of choice of my family.We listen to it whilst travelling around which means that there is the inevitable squabbling about which track should be played first. The cello and piano combine in myriads of different ways to produce feelings ranging from elation to tranquillity. We enjoy the contemporary tracks and the interpretations and adaptations based on classical tracks too. Its just good! Have a look at their videos on Youtube too. I've bought this CD for Christmas presents for others to enjoy too. If something is good - it's worth sharing! ENJOY!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Best angry birds yet. Very challenging and fun at the same time. Learn the ways of the force to blast thru the galaxy.

B000NTHT6G|5.0|This has to be my favorite movie this decade!  In my opinion, this has to be Will Ferrell's best.  We'd seen it in the theater, and had to own it.
1603429999|5.0|I just received my copy yesterday and can't wait to get started! This book is very easy to follow, with clear directions and lots of pictures. The author has done a terrific job at remembering the little details that I have had questions on in the past. Just reviewing the first chapter has given me insight on how to improve joining my knitting.<br /><br />Novice to expert I think any knitter would benefit from Ms. Radcliffe's book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There is simply not much better TV show than Firefly.  It was well written and thoroughly enjoyable to watch.  If you're looking for that rare TV show that is fun to watch and has great characters then Firefly is your best bang for the buck.  The sad thing is that there were only 14 episodes made, but they're all on these discs  and the quality is great.  After you buy this, go and buy Serenity.  It's a condensed version of what Firefly season 2 would've been.  There are also soundtracks available for Firefly and Serenity that are great.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app does work to help me relax and sleep. You do have to put together what works for you and adjust the volume on each sound to suit your particular needs, but that is part of the fun of having the app!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We home school our children and this is part of their animal biology unit studies.  It's also just fantastic to watch as the production values for video are the best and it's well written - entertaining and awe inspiring.
B000ETQR3Q|3.0|Having 2 of these by this point, i have to say to kidults and tool inclined teens this is the best direct plunger modded platform of the original nerf lineup. The power and ranges you can get from a properly done and tuned longshot can touch anything before the elite series. Add to that a lsfg integration and you have a powerhouse for whatever your game of choice may be.<br /><br />However, it does tend to strip darts if you dont cycle it properly which will lead to jams. On top of that stock performance is maybe 20 feet if your lucky.and now these being so rare, i would never spend more then 30 dollars on one. The newer elite series far outclasses this blaster, and as good as the tech inside this one is, its not 300 dollars worthy.
0740748475|5.0|He bought this and The Complete Calvin and Hobbes (Calvin & Hobbes) (v. 1, 2, 3)  They are leather bound and have every Calvin and Hobbes comic ever published.  They're fun and you'll spend hours enjoying them, whether you're reading them for the first time or you remember when they were actually in the newspapers.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|Although I learned something about the language of flowers, I found myself questioning whether the main character would have so easily found this language at such a young age, and so easily found a job where she could use it.  I don't know....not horrible but just a simple read.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity was what season 2 of Firefly would've been had it been made.  If you own the Firefly DVD series then do yourself a favor and buy Serenity as well.  It's a fast moving movie and ties together a lot of loose ends from the Firefly TV series, which is also a must have DVD set.  It's simply one of the best written TV shows in the last 10 years.  There are also soundtracks for both Firefly and Serenity that are thoroughly enjoyable to listen to.
0385720920|4.0|Some very disturbing stuff, but couldn't put the book down.  Took it to read during down times on a trip to see my comedian daughter in LA.  At first embarrassed to be a woman my age reading such a book, I was careful to obscure the title whenever I pulled it out of my bag.  One day I forgot and the front cover was in full view.  I had so many people (mostly 20-somethings, my daughter's generation) comment on what a great book it was, I began to read it unashamedly in public.  Not for the faint of heart or sensibility, but a marvelously written, compelling read.
B005H0IW6W|3.0|My son bought this CD for a friend at his high school for Christmas.  She loved it and so did many of the kids who heard it.
140120841X|2.0|I'm writing this review for the actual product and not the story. I was very disappointed. To start this was like reading an old newspaper comic that had been heavily exposed to sunlight. The colors were faint and it made it hard to distinguish faces and follow the intricate story-line. I was very excited about reading this but the presentation just made it difficult. I've seen digital versions of this graphic novel and they look way better, as expected with a digital copy. I may try a different format but I was disappointed with the quality of the paperback edition. This is a highly rated novel but I'll have to try it on a different format. I'm selling this one back to Amazon.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|That's how I feel about a lot of Stephen King's stories.  Full of suspense and irony.  If only I watched it sooner.  Very good acting.
0930289234|4.0|I recently started diving into the comic book and graphic novel genre and decided to pick up this highly rated mini-series. I was not disappointed. This is great introduction to the genre with great storytelling and intricate character development. The book collects the 12-issue mini-series and is a great-value offered in paperback format. I've always preferred this over hardcover alternatives. The story line is extremely captivating. In fact it was so good that I decided to pickup the Blu-ray and am now keeping up with the new Before Watchmen mini-series which deep-dives into the individual characters. Definitely worth picking up even if you're just getting into the comics genre. A great introduction and a great value.
B00280LYIM|5.0|5 $tar. I love this book!!!!!!!!! I love the percy Jackson books. Rick Riordan is a great author.<br />Great book.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Plays the emotional card too much.  Did not buy the storyline as easily believable.  Loved the snippets about what is it like to be a dog.
B004I744AS|5.0|So much more than a dictionary! I find myself looking forward to the next day's entries. Word of the day, hangman, word within a word, horoscope, famous quotes, and more. Very entertaining and FREE!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Did not get to it yer but come back in a couple of months. Heard a lot about it so will let you know then
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I picked up this book when I saw a recommendation for it on a popular Internet forum. The response itself was very insightful and so I thought I'd check it out.<br /><br />I feel as though fully grasping the concepts in this book would require several read-throughs. However, just understanding how much I have ingrained that I need to unlearn has been worthwhile.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Did not get to read it yet so come back in a couple of months.  I am sure I will love it as Grisham is always fascinating.
0385536828|1.0|The description of this novel's plot sounded mesmerizing --and by an acclaimed author, no less! I read 150 pages and was stupified that anyone could make this story so plodding and dull. The characters were unimaginative and uninteresting.I am a voracious reader, and will give almost any book the benefit of the doubt, but I could simply plow through no further.<br />  Both thumbs down!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I really don't get the negative reviews for this movie, this is seriously one of the better films I've seen in a while. My Dad likened it to E.T. and I have to admit that is good comparison, although I would argue that this movie was darker and had more mystery than ET.<br /><br />The \\"mystery\\" element is one of the best elements of Super 8. So often today, movies just don't have this important plot design element and everything is spoon fed to you like your some kind of baby who can't follow a story. This actually did and successfully captured my imagination. The plot was solid and the characters were well acted and well fleshed out and actually explored.<br /><br />The Presentation: I quite liked the filming style, the picture and color rendition are gorgeous with very authentic special effects and the sound was amazing (a great movie to show off your theater with and impress your friends :). I normally prefer DTS HD Master, but this Dolby True HD track was done very well.<br /><br />Last but not least, the best part of Super 8? It's actually ok to watch with your family (not really young kids mind you). I know that's shocking to say with the crap snuck into movies now-a-days but Super 8 is pretty clean.<br /><br />Worth every penny, I'm picky and only buy movies I think I will watch more than once (believe me, that's not a ton of movies) and I loved it. If you like mystery, adventure, and sci-fi, you won't regret buying this movie.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Very easy to use. I love the game already, and was so glad to find a free version on Kindle!
0316228532|2.0|I was so excited to read this book because I love Rowling's other work.  I knew she was definitely trying to create something that was completely out of the genre of Hogwarts but I found this book to be trying too hard. It seemed as though she spent so much energy trying to make this NOT Harry Potter that some of the quality of writing she is known for was also thrown out with the bathwater.  I found this story to NOT be that interesting. I know that it isn't fair to keep comparing this to the HP series, but that is what this author is known.  People are going to read this book because they love her other work. People want to know if she is capable of creating a world as interesting and charming as the other world she created.  Sadly, this book falls very short. I didn't even finish it.  It was a disappointment for me.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Colin Firth is very convincing in this movie as man who's long time lover has passed away. Because of this event, Firth's character George Falconer is totally lost in this world and is contemplating what to do about it. The film captures the mood of the era of the 60's and it's stifling social environment. It's a beautifully shot film.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Recomnended for all who have tried to ring their bell but can't hear it! One of my favorite holiday movies; Its a Wonderful Life, A White Christmas and Polar Express. Enjoy the memories, Happy Holidays
B0054PSY2W|5.0|It goes without saying for anyone who has watched this that it is awesome.  Very cool it's in blu-ray now too.
B00127RAJY|5.0|...and you will love her for it. This 20 minute workout is intense but not so much so that you're dead. You still feel like you've had an hour long workout. Jillian focuses on combination strength moves. She works you through a warm-up, 3 rounds of 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, and 1 minute of abs, and a cool down. I did this for a week and already saw results: more toned abs, more toned arbs, cardio improved.<br /><br />Jillian is also very encouraging. You don't even realize it, but when you're trying to get those last reps in and want to give up, she reminds you to keep going. When the workout is only 20 minutes, every minute counts.<br /><br />I definitely recommend the DVD for anyone who needs a quick workout and wants all over results.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|I use it to organize my MicroSD cards for my long trips and it works great... The cards stay in the holder and have never fallen out...
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I use my computer all day long for work, video and photo editing, creating music, etc...  all things that require a lot of mouse use.  I was going through a pair of batteries per week.  What would be better than a mouse that could charge itself?<br />The answer is \\"a mouse that could charge itself and didn't lose connection 10-20 times per day\\"<br /><br />If this thing isn't fully charged, it will lose the connection a lot.  I spend half the time removing the battery pack and putting in regular batteries.<br /><br />I would not purchase this product unless you use your mouse sparingly.<br /><br />Also, by the time my frustration with this inferior product got the best of me, my Amazon warranty ran out  (usually amazon is pretty good about this stuff)  --  only a couple of months.  Also, the company only provides there one year warranty if you buy it directly from them.<br /><br />So, this thing is going up on ebay, and I am going to use whatever I can sell it for to purchase some regular rechargeable batteries.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is so far the best app ever<br />I highly reccomend this app to the public<br />buy buy buy this app is really all I have to say ...and again buy buy buy buy buy
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I have seen all the films put out by Sherwood, and have been delighted to see their progress in production ability, acting, etc.  This movie exceeded my expectations on every level, and conveyed a timeless message of men stepping up and taking their place as the leaders of their families.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been a Piano Guys fan/founder for quite some time and I have to say that this album is awesome!  I'm so glad they put Darth back in Cello Wars, it's my son's favorite and because of it he wants to start cello lessons!  Thank you so much for what you do!

B000Q7ZJ9Y|5.0|being that this was shipped overseas, it didnt take long at all. i actually got it quicker than i thought. packaging was perfect - was worth the wait
B0084B5TK8|3.0|The only reason i read it is because i had to. If it was by me i would have never finished it. I find it boring and way to long. But this is only my opinion and this shouldn´t  stope anyone  from reading it.

0812993357|3.0|First things first -- the design of this book is superior to the writing. This is a charming, well-constructed book enlivened by the author's adorable drawings and many photos.<br /><br />Grace Coddington knows a lot, has seen a lot, and has experienced a lot. This book does a fairly good job of communicating her life and her perspectives, but if you are looking for a memoir that provides you with some keys to the Grace Coddington character, well, this isn't the book. For all the anecdotes in this not-short book, Grace Coddington remains a sort of mystery.<br /><br />Part of the problem is probably the quality of the writing. This is breezy and meandering prose. It reads as if it is a transcription of a long series of interviews. And even after the writer, or her editor, or her ghostwriter tightens things up, it remains an invaluable record, but not a terribly well-written piece of work.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I get so involved in this show that I'm always surprised at how fast the time goes by when I watch it!  I'm not a big &#34;slasher&#34; horror fan, but this show goes way beyond with characters you can sink your teeth into and a story line that constantly keeps you wondering what is around the next corner.  I'm so burnt out on reality shows; it's nice to actually see some real creativity on television again!
B0095XPZBC|5.0|There's a reason we buy things on Blu-Ray. Usually it's because we've upgraded our living rooms to bigger screens, now that prices on them have come within reach. And lately, prices on quality audio for them are also coming within reach. Getting a 7.1 or 5.1 audio track with lossless audio on a cherished television series or favorite film now really immerses one in the experience, especially when the screen is filling our vision almost like a private screening.<br /><br />But you know all that.<br /><br />Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season Two on Blu-Ray fulfills the promise of delivering a quality image, not just an upscaled TV image, but a cleaned-up, re-digitized, and in some cases, elements re-filmed, re-mastered, re-composited, television series, this time done in HD, but still unfortunately has to stay in 4:3 aspect ratio. The original media just did not have the extra wide information captured on film.<br /><br />However, where a DVD will seem blurry and indistinct, you will have amazing crispness and detail suddenly pop out at you, things you've never seen before. There's too many examples to mention - and definitely worth leaving as a wonderful surprise for you to try and take in, noticing for yourself episode after episode.<br /><br />The old DVD extra content is as well sharpened up. As far as new extras for this release, don't expect too many. However, you may find it attractive this whole set requires about 1/3 the storage space of [[ASIN:B000062XFG Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Second Season]] (on DVD)

0385742886|2.0|The Maze Runner trilogy started off so well and was such a great idea.  I was fascinated reading the first two books.  I thought the second book “Scorch Trials” was the peak of the trilogy.  But, unfortunately the trilogy got boring and tedious in the third book.  And this prequel, “The Kill Order” was even worse.<br /><br />This book could easily be shrunk down to ten pages and you wouldn’t miss any important plot points.  This book was just a way for Dashner to make a little more money on his once great idea.  The book was just a bunch of pointless action.  I know a lot of people like a lot of action (and I do too sometimes), but this wasn’t interesting action, it was dull and boring action.<br />If you liked the first two books, there’s no guarantee you’ll like this one.  If you loved the third book though (Death Cure), then I think there’s a higher chance you’ll like this one too.<br /><br />In the end I would give The Maze Runner 4 out of 5 stars, The Scorch Trials 5 out of 5 stars, The Death Cure 3 out of 5 stars, and The Kill Order 2 out of 5 stars.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The book was very descriptive and answered many of my questions regarding the last series. THIS book is fully worth FIVE STARS.

0062206281|5.0|Zafon has done a marvelous job of exceeding expectations with this fabulous entry that continues the tale around the Cemetary of Forgotten Books.  In this one Fermin de La Torres is working with Daniel Sempere in the Sempere and Sons books store.  He is about to marry his girlfriend Bernarda when a mysterious stranger arrives at the store.<br /><br />The stranger buys a rare copy of The Count of Monte Cristo and leaves the rare book with David to give to Fermin with a dedication to #13.  Daniel is intrigued by the stranger and follows him.  Later he will tell Fermin about the stranger and give him the book.  This upsets Fermin greatly and he precedes to tell Daniel what happened to him almost 20 years before.  This tale will bring to Daniel questions about his own birth and what really happened to his mother Isabelle.<br /><br />Fermin's tale will tell us what became of David Martin (see The Angel's Game) and will bring in elements from The Shadow of the Wind.  On top of Fermin's tale, Daniel has some questions about his own wife's fidelity.  If it can be said, this book is much better than the first book and almost good as The Angel's Game.  I have waited a long time for this entry and hope it won't be another three year wait for the next entry in this superb tale loaded with rich history of 20th Century Barcelona.
B000O599ZS|5.0|John Ford's movies are so great and this one is not exception. Each time I watch it I get lost in it. Good buy.
B00A1EOBJQ|2.0|Where the heck is 'Fade Into You'??? What a disappointment!!! That is THE best song to come out of the tv series! Also, Jonathan Jackson did another song on the show (maybe titled 'Kiss'..not sure) and I can't find it anywhere! What is going on? If they were going to use these songs, why didn't they get all the rights in the first place?<br />UPDATE: I did find 'Kiss' by Jonathan Jackson on Amazon :)
B002IKLZZY|5.0|What can you say about Cary Grant? He is so good in this movie. I love the chemistry between him and Eva Marie Saint - and what a change for her to play this kind of character. She was excellent.

0385536828|4.0|I was excited to read this based on the blurbs. I was very disappointed. It was not really a thriller and the novels within the novel were boring. The ending turned me off. It seemed really contrived--just to sell the book. McEwan should stick to shorter stories.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|Ever since the first \\"Toy Story\\" film rolled into theaters, I have greatly enjoyed Pixar's contributions to Disney's animated films.  It seems that no matter what genre they decide to tackle, be it superhero movies (The Incredibles), dystopian science fiction (WALL-E), tearjerking Oscar contenders (Up), and even culinary movies (Ratatoullie), they come up with winners.  Even their critically panned \\"Cars\\" movies have been a step above a lot of modern animated movies, and I can't think of with a single Pixar film that I didn't just enjoy, but love.<br /><br />\\"Brave\\" is no exception.  And after so many years of suffering through the pastel-colored, girly-girl world of the Disney Princesses, it's refreshing and wonderful to see a princess who can hold her own.  And the film looks gorgeous to boot.<br /><br />\\"Brave\\" chronicles the story of Merida, princess of a Scottish kingdom who prefers horseback-riding and archery to etiquette and embroidery, much to the consternation of her proper and dignified mother.  When her mother announces that Merida must soon marry in order to prevent a clan feud from overtaking the kingdom, she runs away and decides to change her fate by consulting an eccentric witch in the forest.  The witch grants her wish... but it comes at an unexpected cost, and Merida must take responsibility and act quickly to save both her mother and the kingdom from the consequences of the spell.<br /><br />This film looks absolutely stunning -- Pixar apparently had to rewrite its graphics software for this movie, and it shows in graphics that are top notch.  The Scottish highlands serve as a magnificent backdrop for this story, creating a world that looks almost real.  Hair and fur are well-rendered as well -- Merida's hair in particular is a wild tangle that must have been a nightmare to render but looks real enough to touch.<br /><br />The story has come under criticism by some for being \\"average\\" and not showcasing Merida's talents enough.  I feel it's a wonderful fairy tale, however, and is a great coming-of-age story.  And the moral of the story is a timely one that I think all children and parents should learn -- that our choices have consequences, and we must take responsibility for our actions, for better or for worse.<br /><br />I must also give special mention to the sounds of this movie -- the music and the voice cast.  The music, a combination of traditional orchestral score and bagpipe music, fits the story like a glove, with additional vocal songs woven in seamlessly.  And after seeing so many films that are supposed to take place in foreign countries but have a jarrinly American-sounding voice cast, it's refreshing to hear authentic British and Scottish voices in this film.  The voice cast does a wonderful job bringing the characters to life.<br /><br />I personally consider this one of Pixar's best films yet, and one of the best Disney fairy tales and princess stories in a long time.  Merida is a worthy addition to the Disney Princess roster, and could probably run circles around Snow White and Cinderella (though I think she'd get along well with Mulan...).  Best suited for children 8 and up due to some scary moments.derful fairy tale, however, and is a great coming-of-age story.

B004W2UBYW|2.0|As an apple fan boy I was somewhat intrigued to read this book.  I was a little disappointed.<br /><br />If you don't want to pay $18+ for it, let me summarize it for you.<br /><br />Apple products are good, and Steve Jobs wasn't a very good person.<br /><br />I think a lot of the final chapters can come off as an long ad for Apple.  That being said, my favorite part of the book is when it talks about Apple and the choices they made when making products.<br /><br />I didn't really care for the parts about Steve.  Woz actually seems more like the intriguing personality to me.  Form the book you really get that Steve thought of himself as almost deity.  If he didn't view himself as so indestructible he still me be with us today.<br /><br />For the price, I just can't say it's worth it.

1439199388|5.0|The book is a page turner! Who would ever think a historical and scientific look at allergies and autoimmune diseases could be just that?<br /><br />Moises Velasquez-Manoff writes in a humorous and comprehensive style, and brings a humble and brilliant point of view to the subject.<br /><br />He follows the human evolution as told by parasites, how our DNA and our functional lives is partly the fulfillment of playing host to other life forms in our gut and throughout the body. This natural balance of co-existence changed with civilization, bringing people together in multitudes, and with the advent of cities, industrialization and modernity.<br /><br />Our role as host, changed dramatically, and parasites found themselves in situations where they could literally kill thousands of their hosts and still survive. In our attempts to rid ourselves of fatal diseases, we ended up cleansing ourselves of parasites. Unknowningly, this left a vital part of our function as humans without a job to do- to host parasites. Our bodies are in an unusual state of shock as a result, and so begins the journey into understanding allergies and autoimmune diseases.
0395389496|5.0|This book has great illustrations and is a simple story about the magic of believing in Santa. Be aware that it explores the idea that Santa may not be real, but handles it in a very good way -- leaving it up to the reader to decide. I bought the 25 year anniversary edition and it comes with a CD with Liam Neeson reading the story and an &#34;ornament&#34; (it's made of shiny cardboard).

B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|a cheap knock-off of other such movies - Matrix - Minority Report, etc.  Concept of human nature void of emotions is intriguing, but human actors - with their emotion intact - can't accurately portray emotionless characters.  A poor choice for Bale, as he is usually very believable in his roles - perhaps the novel it was based on was a good read, but did not translate into screen play very well?
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was  a quick sentimental read. I enjoyed this book and the story it told about &#34;family&#34; ...and that family comes in in many unconventional forms.
B007EECSFA|5.0|There aren't many books that completely surprise you at the end like this one did. Being taken back in time of the war and what people endured and suffered was a reminder how terrible war was and how it changed their lives.  I highly recommend this book to all.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I really love this movie. I've probably bought the DVD like 3 times already, but it always gets ruined or lost so the fact that it's now on my Amazon account and I can't pretty much watch it anywhere is great. Also I like it better then itunes, because I don't need my own personal computer, I can just log into my account and there everything is!
B007IYWY3C|5.0|There are plenty of positive reviews on here and the album likely doesn't need another, but as a music lover and general hater on most popular music these days, I needed to put this out there - this album beautifully showcased the lead singer's voice and orchestral arrangements in a way you don't come close to hearing in the studio albums.<br /><br />The Jackson cover isn't great, but I'd say it's the only disappointing track on the album, and the magnanimity of awesomeness contained by every other song on here trivializes any complaints I have with that specific track.<br /><br />Overall: Haunting. Magical. Nearly perfect. It has not left my CD player for 2 weeks.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|It's a Wes Anderson movie, so I really enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the fact that I could rent it, because I don't watch movies over and over again for the most part. So it declutters my movie selection.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I looked at a lot of apps to help keep up with all of the ToDo's that I have. TNT is not perfect but it was the one I kept coming back to after testing other apps and I continue to use it. Most important for me was the ability to separate all of my different projects into their own views and columns. I wish they would add an additional field to track who that task is assigned to or who I need to contact.  Good app.

0979019710|5.0|Hal has outdone himself this time! Excellent book. Some books are simply for motivation, some for spreading ideas, some for strategies and tactics. This is the type of book that gives you a kick in the pants to get you to change your life. Not only does Hal provide the motivation for you to create a morning routine that propels your life to new levels but he gets specific giving you a rubber meets the road type strategy that will get you results.<br /><br />To be honest, I have known the benefits of being a morning person for years and often would start my days at 5am but it was always a struggle. I was a snoozer. Lately I found myself hitting that snooze button five or six times before finally giving in and starting my day. The 5-Step Snooze-Proof Wake Up Strategy section was a HUGE help. I put those exact steps into practice and it's made starting my day early so much easier.<br /><br />Think you have a busy schedule that can't a morning personal growth routine in? WRONG. I travel extensively, often needing to leave the house at 4 am to catch early flights. But now thanks to Hal's 6-Minute Miracle I am still able to start my day in a supercharged way.<br /><br />The strategy is here. Right in front of you laid out and detailed. All you have to do is take action.

B0067TQQI8|5.0|I've seen other adverts for similar products offering less voltage for a higher price. I since receiving this I have used it over 20 times I've had it for two weeks. I received it in two days. I it came fully charged which already gave me an idea of its energy storing capabilities.. It comes with the wires and connections promised however I will say that one wire is much shorter then they other with the longer wire being half the size of the typical charger wire, however, this comes in handy because it makes the whole package less bulky for traveling.. Example I have a Samsung galaxy s3 I use a swivel waist case I was able to keep the portable charger in my pocket while it was connected to my phone on my waist without have a visible wire hanging from the bottom of my shirt. Even better the phone fits in the provided pouch while connected to charge completely out of sight while still being mobile. Something for those nights your out to eat and your phone starts to die no more out in the open charging from a wall while strangers eye your phone. The the charge time was slower then I like for a full charge from about 20 percent battery life took about 50mins which when considering is only about 15 mins longer then if it were connected to my home charger. I am able to charge my phone twice from 15 to 20 percent battery to full and still have a little juice left over. I having extra juice is good because with the extra connections I can help friends charge their devices. This was actually the determining factor for me when choosing between this and an extended battery. I like the flexibility..Overall this was perfect for my needs it was a litter heavier then i expected but it's still compact and has two usb ports for multiple devices this is also a great feature. I'm not to big on the no off but to be thing but it never seems to stay on when there is no device connected so im not worried about it losing power over time. I am pleased with this purchase and would recommendit to anyone who constantly finds tthemselves with a dead mobile device battery and no outlet or charger in sight.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album, as with all if The Piano Guys' music, is absolutely fantastic! I have been following their music since some of their very first songs started coming out on YouTube and I cannot get enough! It really is just about the only music I listen to at this point. They have figured out a way to mix pop culture with classical music and there is something amazing about that. It's a new take on a beautiful part of our culture. It is a fantastic way to carry on the traditions of classical music while mixing it with something new to keep it interesting for a widely diverse population. I only hope they continue to put out music for a very long time.

1451629184|5.0|Most of us are aware of the Jaycee Dugard story.  This is the story in Jaycee's own words, and it is, to say the least, an emotional tear-jerker.  As sad and heartbreaking as it is, I believe everyone should read it!<br />SO many times, I have felt that things in life are unfair, and woe is me.  Well here is a girl who had 18 years of her life taken from her, had unthinkable things done to her, not to mention what her poor mother went through.  Yet Dugard comes out of this strong, positive, and thankful for what she does have.  This book makes you believe in the power of strength and hope.  I don't know how this poor girl managed to stay strong and have such an amazing attitude.  It is a book that stays with you forever.

0545265355|5.0|By now, I am sure that there are not many people out there who haven't read these books.  I am writing this review because I held out and didn't read them for a while, despite all the hype.<br /><br />I didn't read these books at first (even though I am an avid reader and usually read popular books as soon as they become popular), because:  the \\"young adult/teen\\" label kind of threw mw (I'm in my 30s), and I am not usually into science fiction.  I usually read popular fiction.<br /><br />I understand the young adult/teen label, due to the fact that the main characters are teens themselves.  However, I didn't feel that the subject matter or the writing itself was necessarily for younger people exclusively.  I thought Twilight and other books I've read were written much younger than these books.<br /><br />Also, although I did read the Twilight saga, I typically don't read science fiction, but the Hunger Games trilogy deals with so many human emotions and is just so dang addictive that it draws you in, no matter what genre you prefer.<br /><br />These books are fast paced and impossible to put down.  I read about 3 books a week this year, and these are easily, without a doubt, my absolute favorites.  So if there are any hold-outs out there like I was, read the book!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|European has done it again. Every time I read one of his books I want to read the next. I have read every single book he has written, and can't wait for the next. I know I have spent over $100 on his books.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Like all of Lee Child's books this is exciting from the third page to the very back ot the book.
0316098337|5.0|A tough story so well imagined that I found myself for weeks thinking about how a naive child would describe the world.  This is remarkable writing....
B003WUYP56|3.0|I am not enthralled by this one. It was purchased for something to read and I read it when I am not graced with another book or the internet connection...
B00932AA5G|5.0|Wow!!  What a lot of plot twists.  If someone would write a book off of a movie this would be a great one.
B007HO392S|5.0|After hearing the Blown Away song, had to have the album.  Enjoy every song and plan on buying more Carrie Underwood albums.
B0053O89IS|4.0|Was shipped promptly and for the most part plays well. I ordered a used copy and the first disc skips a bit. Every other disc does fine and the case is undamaged. Overall satisfied with this product.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. The writing was engaging and entertaining. Great read for fans of romance and brutal action. Totally reading the sequel. :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this was a great read a little slow to start but half through the first book you can't stop with the rest!!! LOVED these books re read them right away
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I discovered Celtic Woman on YouTube while browsing Enya's Orinoco Flow, and simply loved it.<br />Although this DVD has removed Orinoco Flow from its track list, I am delighted to possess it.<br />It is complete audio-visual entertainment.<br /><br />Oinam James Singh
B008SOS63S|4.0|My journey with Joe starte right after he released his first album.I saw him in a little bar in Tulsa . I knew then if he made it trough the traps and hardships that happen to many young talents he would be special. I have bought everything Joe has put out and never been disappointed.Joe gets better with time and I look forward to his next offerings,and I must admit I like Joe better when it's just he and his band .
0783229372|5.0|Great movie
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have listened to these songs many, many times, and they don't get old!  Their music is good, uplifting, fun, beautiful, and unique.  I love them so much, and I am definitely a big fan; The Piano Guys are extremely talented!  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know that classical music is fun.  They also play some of the most uplifting music I have ever heard, and you can hear and feel the difference.  Thank you Piano Guys!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Spent way too much time to get stars on all games .  Stayed up too late for this.  Will probably do it again.
0345803485|1.0|I am so sorry that I purchased this trilogy as a gift for my friend. It took way to many chapters to even get started. I got to chapter 6 and still no thrilling excitement, so that is where I put it down. I usually purchased books from urban writers and they get to the point a hell of alot sooner than E.L.James did. So I purchased my friend something a hell of alot more exciting and more erotic to read. James to me knew nothing about writing an EROTIC book at all.  That book was given so much publicity until people ran out and purchased this trilogy, what a waste of money. Back to my regular erotic books from now on.
B003Y5H5JM|5.0|The production, the actors, the scenery and the additional special interviews on the DVD make this TEMPEST one to re-visit again and again.  The costumes seem to grow out of the earth.  The inspired interpretation by Helen Mirren gives deep meaning to Shakespeare's vision.  And the interviews are a master class in all aspects of this production.
B009O5CLZY|1.0|this sucks! I paid for this and I cant even download it. there is something wrong the people need to fix it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wonderful historical novel.  I loved the development of characters through the years.  The book was both engaging and educational.  I enjoyed it very Munich.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I just love Connelly's character Bosch.  Although I know that Bosch is going to deliver the goods, Connelly keeps me on pins and needles.  Every time it's a page turner.  I've read every Bosch novel and now I have to wait for the next well researched one to come out.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have always been a great fan of Harry Bosch.  He lets us see his weaknesses but he does not let them stop him.  He is very human and I can identify with him.  Everything about him and his work, he relationships and his deductions is believable.  This novel is a good as any that have gone before.  I recommend it.
1476712042|5.0|I love reading love novels ive red books from authurs like e.l. james, sylvia day, catherine bybee, and one of my favorites nicholas sparks but this book is the best book you can get your hands on the authur is fantastic an makes the love just pop out at you it seems so real. im speechless...if you want a romantic novel this 1 is it and i cant wait to see whats in store through Travis's eyes in walking disaster its to bad thats is gonna be such a period of time for this book to come out but...VERY GOOD WORK Jamie Mcguire!
B006S01GH2|5.0|This is a great movie! Sweet and charming and just the perfect amount of quirky! I would recommend this to anyone.
1451696191|4.0|I found Perks of a Wallflower to be a very interesting book but still really good. This book is filled with relationships, drugs, conflicts, emotion and reality. Charlie, a mental illness boy starting high school, tells his life through a bunch of letter to an anonymous person. I personally did not like the format. When Charlie meets Sam and Patrick he soon becomes part of the social life, comes across more conflicts, and get into things he never thought he would.  I liked this book because it showed things that I could relate to.  This book is great for high school students because I think that they could really connect to this book in a lot of ways. All the actions that take place in this book usually happen every day in high school.<br />The most engaging conflict in my opinion was when Charlie kissed Sam when he was \\"dating\\" Mary Elizabeth. I was as interested as what would happen next. A kind of unusual aspect of this story is that Charlie is friends with Sam and Patrick. In the real world usually people like Charlie don't really have friends. Another aspect is that Charlie is filled with a ton of emotion but also shows it. Most boys wouldn't be caught dead crying in public and especially in front of a girl.<br />I recommend this book to people who love reading about everyday high school conflicts through a student. I would not recommend it to younger children. Young and teenagers will definitely be able to take something away from this book.
1449410243|5.0|This book will crack up anyone who has or had a cat. Full color, includes a poster. Lots of laughs. :)
B0074YVW1G|1.0|I purchased this book in the Kindle edition but, unfortunately, didn't start reading it within the first 7 days so I was unable to return it. The content was digitally scrambled so that it did not proceed from page to page, occasionally lapsing in to footnotes, but without returning to the chronological pages of the text. No amount of page turning, chapter forwarding, \\"Go to\\", \\"Sync\\"-ing or preferences would resolve it. I've given up soon after starting Chapter 2.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|Likes: Easy to control and operate. Fun weapon upgrades.<br />Dislikes: Do you really have to pay that much money for extras? I understand the company has to make money, but I'm not--nor should anyone else--have to pay for extras.<br /><br />4 stars from me. Clever maps and AI. Loves the weapon upgrades and gore. I'd definitely recommend this to gamers who want to play something different.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|HOPE SPRINGS uses comedy to shed a bright light on the reality of marriages whose &#34;fires&#34; have nearly burned out.  Lots of married couples will relate to this film.  Both Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones deliver wonderful performances.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|absolutely love this movie! it's so much fun (and so FLUFFY!)! The additional shorts are hysterical as well! Def. recommend this!
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|The female singer is great with her angry female lyrics.  Fast paced metal and some slower songs thrown in.  Lots of fun it put a big smile on my face.
B002BVYBC4|5.0|I love the series of the Fast and the Furious! This one was great, especially since I used to live in Miami and it's reassuring that they filmed there vs. on a hollywood lot
B002A4Q652|3.0|I dont know about the melodic singing which seems to be kindof all over the place, although her voice is nice.  The one song with the growling guy is atrocious.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Got this for my momma for christmas! we absolutely LOVE the show and she talks about the music all of the time! I'm sure when she opens it, it will be on repeat for the rest of the day!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The special effects of this movie really shine in 3D.  It really looked great on our new TV and we all enjoyed the experience.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|I like the twitter app on my iphone better than on my kindle. I don't really tweet from my kindle that much
B005LAII08|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  We watched it with our grandchildren and they want to watch it again and again.  We will give a copy to our graddaughter.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was hard getting through the first two books with all of that sex, but now I'm glad that we FINALLY know is childhood trauma.  I probably wouldn't read it again though. Once is definitely enough!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am I love with this games. I can't stop playing.I am always trying to bet the tasks.  if you want a game to keep you busy. THIS IS THE GAME
B007IXWKUK|3.0|A LOT of sex, and seemed to drag on a bit, but overall it was okay. I probably wouldn't read it again though. Once is definitely enough!
B00AHXIC50|3.0|I'll keep it brief. This album is all over the place, genre-speaking, and some tunes are pleasant but over produced. He's a very talented singer and a catchy writer. No argument there. But this album falls short when compared to his first. His first album was more musically and vocally pure and cohesive. In this one he goes from raggae to oldies, to pop. And while variety can be good, he sounds different on each track. That works for an amazing SNL skit, but not on a record.
B005LAII1C|5.0|every household with no children should own this movie! it's great for a real GOOD laugh, and given it's filmed in parts of my hometown, it makes it &#34;wicked pissah&#34; :)
B000B5OD4I|5.0|I have been wanting this watch for some time. Great watch. You won't be disappointed. The lume on this watch is great also
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like playing this on my kindle! it's a lot of fun and never gets boring. will probably have to buy the one without ads
B009JBZH54|5.0|My fiancee loved this gift, there is a book that comes with this set that has awesome pictures, and there are different DVDs with special effects! Awesome buy!
B0029XFN9O|5.0|I don't really see a HUGE difference in Blu-ray, but it is great to watch and absolutely hilarious! tis the season!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy the simple yet complex structure of this game. It helps develop simple mechanics and keeps you occupied at the same time.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is so much fun! it's especially fun on a bigger screen. may have to just buck up and spend money for an ap with no ads
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|A lot of people posted they didn't like this book. My best friend told me to read this book. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this was a great series! I was very happy with the entire series, even if at some parts made me feel a little uncomfortable because we are talking about teenagers. Overall, it was great!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I made my husband see this movie and he liked it! so trust me that means a lot!!! Plus I really enjoyed it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great ap and it looks great on my kindle! pinning is very easy on my kindle! i love it!
B005HSL626|5.0|I am having so much fun in the p.m.  My daughter told me about the game.  Once you start playing you cannot stop.
B004XC5LP0|4.0|don't really see much of a difference from a regular DVD or a blu-ray but either way it's a good movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Could play this for hours.  Enjoy switching between different games.  I always liked solitare with playing cards.  This fits the bill.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The acting is excellent, the quality of the movie is superb and hits on some hardcore racial issues, which opens up the eyes of those who've had them shut the tightest! great film!
0979019710|4.0|I had the opportunity to read Hal's book before it hit the shelves and it's really made a HUGE difference in my life. I followed every step of the book whether I agreed with it or not and after a week or two I was amazed by the level of energy I had, the great mood I was in and the amount that I accomplished. But like anything else in life, something came up one day and I slept in and woke up at 7 instead of 5. I missed a day. Then 2. By the 3rd day I had fallen back down to where I was before. I lost that bounce in my step. I wasn't getting as much accomplished throughout the day. It was amazing what a difference it made! Needless to say I \\"woke up\\" again and I'm back on the program. It makes all the difference in the world. You have to give it a shot! Trust me!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina did a fairly good job with this. It's a good book, but some parts left me wondering &#34;where is she going with this?&#34; she (eventually) does tell you, but overall, i liked it
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Maybe I'm biased because I really enjoyed the book, but this movie is awful.  The pacing was terrible, the characters were flat and the story lost quite a lot in the translation.<br /><br />Also, not really related to the movie but, come on Amazon no HD for the PC?  Seriously?  I know it's either some stupid licensing issue or more likely a ploy to get us to use Kindles, but I for one buy a ton of stuff from Amazon (book, movies, socks, everything)  and I don't own a Kindle, nor do I have any plans to own one.  So stop shoving it down my throat.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|This is a great movie franchise and I'm glad Vin Diesel is back in this one! I can't wait for the next installment
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is my favorite game ever.My favorite pony is appleblom and rarty.Find me on youtube  allforyoutubekides.<br /><br />Bestest game ever I think that is awesome that it is free.My favorite pony is appleblom and rarty.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A LOT of sex, and seemed to drag on a bit, but overall it was okay. I probably wouldn't read it again though. Once is definitely enough!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|One of our fav's we love thses two guys together. It's a safe bet for any of their movies. This takes Zombies to a very funny level.
B006L9B6TI|3.0|I haven't finished the &#34;program&#34; but it's very similar to the Secret (duh), but for the most part it's okay
B002WY65VU|5.0|i liked this movie when we first saw it. I tried to find it around town. i could have looked harder, but amazon is easy and convenient. I guess i have picked up some lazy zombie tendencies. great zombie movie (but I am no expert) the characters in this movie make it great!
B002BGFUPQ|2.0|I love the franchise, but this one is NOT one of my favorites. I suppose it takes more than just the one time to have it grow on you.
B005LAIGSM|1.0|This movie is NOT a Family friendly movie.  There is cursing and nudity.  After about fifteen minutes we took the DVD out, cut it up and threw it out!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book! Finished it quicker than I thought I would and the story line was something I've never read before. It was great!
1594135851|5.0|If you're on book 2, you're going to love it. Much better than I expected. Do note this is in large print. It's difficult to find regular sized print in paper back, even at walmart.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|What a great movie! The story line was great, and the acting was fabulous! The picture is super clear and vibrant!
B002B554TO|5.0|Listening to the songs from side A the hairs on my arm are standing up with the richness in tone in Florence's voice. This Album is well made and the songs are catchy.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|this was a great film and a great way to end the Batman series! Christian Bale is amazing and i'm happy to add this to my collection.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|Interview with the Vampire is an amazing film. The story will entrance you, the characters will actually make you care about them.
B005R4255C|5.0|I LOVE this album! I saw the Cirque show as well and that's what inspired me to purchase this disk! I listen to it everyday!
B009F1ZYCO|5.0|It's great hearing this album in a warm vinyl copy. The recording quality is decent.The Pictures on the vinyl are definitely a plus. For any Maiden fans this is a must.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I have yet to finish this book, but from what I've read so far, I suppose it is okay. :)
B0002BO05S|5.0|The Greatest Story Ever Told is one of my old time favorites. I ordered it because I wanted to have a copy in my video collection. I love the fact that I can find exactly what I need for a fraction of its cost on Amazon!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book! Finished it quicker than I thought I would and the story line was something I've never read before. It was great!
B0099G3I96|1.0|I've always loved the edgy, kinda-raw sound of ND, but this album had NONE of that. It was too clean cut and slow, definitely not what I am used to. Their song &#34;Settle down&#34; is probably the best 1 on the whole album, and even that song gets old after a few listens. I've never gotten tired of a ND song, but I'm tired of settle down already. The lyrics also lack the depth that I love about their old songs.<br /> I think this album caters to a different crowd and the band is going in a different direction which is cool and all, but its not for me.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game when I play it on my iphone, but playing it on my kindle is SO much more fun! It's free, so just download it and kiss the next hour of your life goodbye hahah but it's well worth it! :)
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Gives you a good inside to baseball and how it works and the man that brought this style into the game and about his life.
B0063GORYU|2.0|this game is a very enjoyable passtime andi play it when I do have the time I would reccomend it highly
B009329ZF2|5.0|It starts out slow but picks up fast and has a story line that is easy to fallow even though its a violent movie.But it does make you feel proud that the old veterans play a part in this. Loved this movie !!!!
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Downey at his best with a terrific supporting cast, Moriaty was the essense of intellectual evil, delicious. I don't often view a film more than once, I have purchased this one with the expectation of revisiting it again and again. Very selective in adding movies to my library.
B002N57KG2|4.0|this is a silly/comical race across the U.S. with all kinds of situation (and anything they can get away with) happening along the way to the finish line.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome and simple<br /> That describes a lot<br />I RECOMMEND YOU GET IT RIGHT NOW' it is pretty awesome I promise!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|a very mysterious, action, violent movie that takes your feelings on a roller-coaster ride even though wasn't disappointing on  the way it ended. Not recommended for under 18 because of the nudity, rape, and violence.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I alway enjoy Michael Connelly books and Harry Bosch is one of my favorite characters. Despite the 3 stars (its okay), I do recommend the book. It's just that many of the Harry Bosch stories are more suspenseful than this one. In the last analysis though, I still remain a staunch fan.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|If you don't think of the original story and go open minded, you can enjoy the movie and special effects and be surprise on the way the story is played out.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was amazed by Dr. Alexander's story, and as a fellow believer, I was warmed by the imagery he created in his description of his NDE journey. I don't think it is coincidental that God would use a respected Neurosurgeon in such a personally significant way.
B009186JYI|5.0|I've seen nearly every film on and by the Rolling Stones, including bootlegs, since 1965.  This is the ultimate film to see and to own if you're a die-hard fan of the band, especially in its early days with Brian Jones.  Keith Richard(s) was quite funny and there's even a glimpse of Nanker Phelge composing songs like Sittin' On The Fence!
B0079J28NW|5.0|What Beatles fan doesn't want this. My 32 yr old daughter was thrilled to get this on blue ray disc.
0312263511|5.0|Good to mee the man himself as he filmed a special and taped at the Boneyard in Tucson AZ. Great guy, and really enjoyed this book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Consistently works great, both on local WiFi and remotely, with immediate and simple setup. With clever interface decisions throughout. Thanks for a great product!
B008NB0SQO|4.0|My friends and I really enjoyed watching it.  I forgot how many songs are in this movie. Still one of my favorites.
B00030DEQE|5.0|I just received my card today and have not installed and tested. For those of you that are having problems finding the location of the drivers, here is the website.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Hopefully I will remember to come back in a wk to update my review.
0802473156|4.0|I purchased this as a Christmas present. So for now I can only comment that it got here in time.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I picked Phillip as the American Idol the minute I saw his audition and followed him all the way through!  I've downloaded all his Idol songs.  It's great having a young man who is a good role model for our kids.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|Beautiful movie. Very inspiring. Couldn't have imagined better actors for it, they were perfect! Healing is possible and things look up eventually, it's just a matter of perspective ;)
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is an amazing set.  It's so much better than I expected.  The music box is so cute and the books and postcards are beautiful.  It didn't hurt that I got it on a great sale too!!  Love love love it!
160094048X|5.0|I like classics and the chocolate chip cookie recipe in here is THE best I've ever had!!! A glass of cold soy milk on the side and I'm good to go!
B0061S073A|1.0|Did not work.  had to delete it.  Using a kindle fire 2nd edition.  Loaded fine but would not allow any applications to run.  Maybe I done something wrong myself  but doubt it.
1451696191|5.0|Love love love the innocence of Charlie's mind and his view of the world and ahhh I just wanna be friends with him!
0544045203|5.0|Saw the movie, loved it.  The book adds a deeper dimension and explains in more detail what was only touched upon in the movie.  A very easy read.  Written in a light and humorous style with a distinctive Indian perspective, but also with a universal tone.  Who among us has not sought God?  Have we been as intentional as Pi?  Have we been a successful?<br /><br />Loved the twist at the end - made me think.  Launched a thousand discussions with my friends.
B00004TS0E|5.0|OK, well, I don't think I've ever seen the original b/w, though. However, I DO own about two dozen Christmas DVD's (I had three kids, all pretty much grown up now) . . . and this one is my favorite! So, I had to vote!!! I LOVE Christmas . . . and this one completely warms my heart, with a wide holiday grin. Admittedly, it helps if you're either middle-aged, a parent, and/or like touching sentimental movie lines. I thought the cast was VERY likable, very endearing. (I think my teen/young adult kids would vote for Home Alone, though . . . more action, more laughs.) It's very rare that I'll want to watch a movie more than once, but I personally would gladly watch this every Christmas:) Admittedly, it's kind of a goofy love story . . . and it's beautifully festive in color ;)
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I actually watched this movie twice in a row. A good movie for the younger generation, but other than that it was good.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love this game and it addicting....jus wish u guys would make it easier to add friends on here instead of only facebook....like any of the story games e.g. bakery story or dragon story they make it easy to add friends....a feature like that where u create an id and add friends through that. then it will deserve a 5 star....btw how do I buy another island so I can breed more dragons?
B0086700CM|1.0|its a super bad game. I do notrecomend  it too anyone.<br />it sucks.<br />its so bad that my baby girl vomited just watching it
B008XX6J4C|5.0|these two men have given me so much pleasure.  They have a way of making a classical song fresh again.  Their renditions are fanominal,their passion comes across in every song that they do.  This cd has all of the songs that I have come to love.  Please don't ever quit.  I recommend this cd to anyone because it has everything that you could possibly want.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|very interesting plot that's has left me waiting for more, the hero's is likable and he grew on me quick, Looking forward to the second book.
0741470314|5.0|This book not only details the magical and angelic nature of Michael's life, but also captures the very isolation and captivity his \\"celebrity\\" status handed him. Karen did a phenomenal job with providing such an intimate and diverse selection of perspectives to Michael life, that every fan would feel he or she watched his life unfold before their very eyes. I highly recommend this book to every person, fan or foe, because it's eye opening, inspiring, heartbreaking, but raw all in a few short pages. She did an incredible job with research. I can't imagine the emotional ride it had been to write such a piece of amazing literature. I'm honored to have a copy and humbled to have such access to such a truthful insight to the man I so deeply love.
0446580848|2.0|I'm a big DeMille fan and have read every single one of his books. I was really looking forward to the new John Corey book. As much as I hate to say it, The Panther was my least favorite out of all of them. Even bringing back Paul Brenner from the General's Daughter and Up Country did not improve this slow mover. I struggled to get through the first 600 pages and then it was over. All of the background and build up did not make the 20 or so last pages worth it. Sorry, but I was really disappointed in this one.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I just love the Piano Guys. I have followed them since Love Story meets Viva la Vida, and they are so amazing!
030758836X|2.0|Until the time that Amy shows up in the Ozarks, this is an engrossing, well-written book, both as a mystery and as an examination of a troubled marriage.  But the rest of the book seems much more poorly written--soap opera-ish with caricatures for characters.  The scenes with Desi are almost laughable.  Makes me wonder, was this book written by two different authors?
B003JBHQP4|5.0|I use this to read a CF card from a Fostex MR8 to my Windows 7 system. It works great and is MUCH faster than the slow USB 1.1 of the Fostex. Can't beat the price, either. Would definitely recommend.<br /><br />System used:<br /><br />Windows 7 x64
B007NZQUUE|5.0|As an admirer of Atlanta Hope (aka Ayn Rand) I enjoyed the digs at her philososphy.  I'm not into solipsism at all but I thoroughly enjoy the anarchistic humour!  As a member of the League of Dynamic Discord I give this my stamp of approval and as a member of God's Lightning I condemn this peace (sic very sic) of work with the utmost contempt.
B006R1T40I|4.0|for an album from Bonnie. I like it because I love her voice and she sure can play the blues.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Overall it was a very good movie but it left a lot to be desired. The 1st Dark Knight movie was very entertaining and so was this 1. What the 1st movie lacked that this 1 was chock full of was cheese factor. Who decided to make Bane sound like Jiminy Cricket?
B004J4WLB4|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure I would like it, but as I kept reading, it was very hard to put it down until finished.  Love it!  Highly recommend it.  As a person who loves flowers I learned so much more about the meaning of different flowers and trees. Some parts were heart-wrenching, but it was an awesome story.
B007HO392S|4.0|My wife is huge Carrie Underwood fan, so this was a slam dunk for her.  I think that she is a very gifted singer and an even better entertainer.  When she is singing in her normal voice in her natural octave she's great.  However, I do tend to get very annoyed when she tries to show off her pipes and she starts blasting loud shrill notes.  To me it's like nails on a chalkboard.  It doesn't stop my wife from rocking out to it all the time though.  It is great for her to listen to in her car on the way to work, when I'm not with her.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|Our family eagerly anticipated watching the sequel to the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". We were disappointed to find not so much a sequel as a revised future to the story. All the beloved characters from \\"Phantom\\" are here, but personalities and lifelines may have been altered. I don't want to give too much away, since if you can handle the revisions it is an enjoyable story. We we just jarred by going in expecting a true sequel. May this review give you the information you need to enjoy this musical for what it is; a possible new future for old favorites.
B003ASLJKO|5.0|We used to have this film on VHS when I was a kid we loved it.  Reynolds and Eastwood have great chemistry as former best pals who still have a deeply buried soft spot for each other.  Great cast in general, fun moments of both comedy and action, I don't really have any complaints about this movie at all.  Just don't expect it to be The Untouchables.  It's a lighthearted action/comedy that takes place during prohibition.  Buy it, you'll thank yourself later.
0553801473|4.0|I just started reading this book. It is great so far, I don't want to put it down.<br />I would recommend this book and the other four to anyone who likes swords, knights, kings and dragons.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Harrison Ford is awesome.  Always has been, always will be.  It's funny how after many years this film has become the quintessential sci-fi film.  It's well deserved, it's just interesting to see how it has taken so long for it get it's due.  It is a great movie and anyone who hasn't seen it is doing themselves a disservice.  Granted if you aren't a fan of anything having to do with stories set in the future or sci-fi in general then you probably aren't going to give this film much of a chance.  However, many of the subplots elevate this above just some other trivial sci-fi popcorn film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Speechless. I can't even say anything it's just that good. I would read it all in one sitting if I didn't have to sleep or eat or go to school.

B0002EXH5O|1.0|Rust in Peace is one of my favorite albums of all time.  In fact, I'd argue that it is the best Heavy Metal album out there, even surpassing great music from artists like Death, Slayer, and old school Metallica; and yet, this version of the album is severly tainted.<br /><br />What makes Rust in Peace great is that the band had finally gotten a lineup that mixed skill and professionalism.  Nick M. unleashes some really aggressive drumming here that was perfect for thrash band at the time.  The power and choices of fills gave him a great deal of style, and he far surpassed Chuck B.  I'm not going to say he was better than their first drummer Gar S. (RIP), but he was a really great drummer for the time.<br /><br />Add to the album the fact that it was written during the Cold War, and it is about the Cold War, and some of the songs are ;ironically, still relevant today, and you're starting to get the picture.  The real genius of the album; however, is the idea of Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman to have their own version of a Cold War, on guitar.  Piece by piece, they go back and forth alternating guitar leads and hitting us with some of the most intricate guitar work Metal had ever seen.  It's mind blowing!<br /><br />Last but not least, the album cover.  World leaders huddled around the band's mascot Vic Rattlehead inside \\"Hangar 18\\" as he experiments on a space alien with Kryptonite (yes, symbolic references to Superman from DC Comics).<br /><br />It's amazing!  If you are a metal fan, you have to buy Rust In Peace!  Yet, I can't recommend this version.  Something... happened... the record label lost the vocals and they had to re-record them.  Fine.  OK... until you get to Five Magics.  Dave's re-performance on that song is laughable and childish, and the new version ruins the whole song, and I would argue, the whole album.  Now, this album isn't a long affair, so one ruined song taints the whole thing.<br /><br />So yes, absolutely buy Rust in Peace.  Buy it for afriend.  Buy 15 copies and use them as stocking stuffers and be loved by all your Metalhead friends.  Don't buy this version though.  Do yourself a favor and buy the original and just listen to it on a high quality CD player.  The playing is the same, and the vocals aren't ruined ;-)
B008LY9AWG|5.0|We know, of course, Michael Connelly's novels are the very best of the crime-detective-lawyer works of this generation but now he adds even more luster to his name by becoming an amazingly good short story writer. It's a difficult form and he is a true master of it. If this wonderful author had his laundry list published, I'd pay full price for it. He's terrific.<br />George Atkins
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|My whole family loved this movie; it's heartwarming, and funny, and an excellent adventure for anyone. And the movie is so pretty!
B0076DELIG|5.0|This one is right up there with the best of the Harry Bosch masterpieces. How does he keep doing it? And why? Connelly must now have more than enough money and yet he works hard enough for us to get a new one at least every two years. There isn't the slightest dip or drop in quality either and that is in sharp contrast to quite a few big selling authors. But the waiting between books gets tougher and tougher. How can we get him to put one out every, say, six months? Put him on speed? Make him go without sleep? The answer may lie in the cloning process. Science needs to crank out enough Michael Connellys to give us one new Connelly book a week. The question then becomes, for that necessary seasoning process, how could the Los Angeles Times use two or three dozen crime reporters now that the paper has become a shrunken pile of junk?<br />George Atkins
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Fun with words ... I can do it too! So I totally almost had one when I listened to it!!! I'm not sure if it was \\"A Conjunction Of Drones Simulating The Way In Which Sufjan Stevens Has An Existential Crisis In The Great Godfrey Maze\\" or \\"Let's Hear That String Part Again, Because I Don't Think They Heard It All The Way Out In Bushnell,\\" perhaps early in the album with \\"The Black Hawk War, Or, How To Demolish An Entire Civilization And Still Feel Good About Yourself In The Morning, Or, We Apologize For The Inconvenience But You're Gonna Have To Leave Now, Or, 'I Have Fought The Big Knives And Will Continue To Fight...\\" but at some point I realized this could be the finest album ever made. Yeah he totally Fiona Apple's his song titles but that doesn't take away from the pure beauty of his song. I love song titles that have more words than actual lyrics in the song. I think its fun!!! It leaves so much to be analyzed and misconstrued by fans and critics to of course mistake it with brilliance. He's like the guy Bright Eyes, but has more things going on musically, and totally doesn't play up the whole \\"i'm an indie artist, and i have sad eyes\\" bs all these acts do now. I read he wanted to do an album for each state of the union. He's almost 40, and does Christmas albums, so hopefully he gets to work! Looking forward to his album of my homestate of Arkansas when he's 115. Hope his voice is as pretty then. And I can't wait to see him promoting it with some hipster Arkansas sweater from a wheelchair w/ a breathing machine hooked up. I wonder if he'll refer to himself in the third person then like he loves to do. Maybe, \\"Sufjan just pooped himself\\" or \\"Mr. Stevens doesn't remember you, you look pretentious too. Are you related to me? Oh, you're my daughter!? Hi, I'm Sufjan. Well, I guess you know that. Call me Suf.\\"
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Of course it is a wonderful book -- been years since I last read it and it still annoys me that it stops and doesn't end.

B009LRE040|4.0|This movies typically reflects Nolan's film style, which blends nicely with Batman's story and identity. The only complaint I'd have is that the movie took itself too seriously, never remembering its comic book origins, or even interspersing the tragic storyline with spurts of comedic or romantic moments. Other than that I was engrossed throughout the movie, and would recommend this movie strongly to others.<br />It'll send a shiver down your spine the first time you hear:<br />I AM GOTHAM'S RECKONING!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book so much I had dreams about it thank you Jeff Kinney for making this book can you make an 8th one next year

B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is an excellent CD, and well worth the money. It is a perfect blend of  a beautiful classical music style and the popular music we all know and love. I have not heard a song from The Piano Guys that I did not like.

B000ICLRIE|5.0|The Cast:<br /><br />Kingdom Of Heaven (2005) is an epic action film directed by Ridley Scott (Gladiator) and stars Orlando Bloom (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy) as Balian, Eva Green (Casino Royale) as Princess Sibylla, Jeremy Irons (The Man In The Iron Mask ) as  Tiberias the Marshal of Jerusalem, Edward Norton (American History X) as  King Baldwin IV, and Liam Neeson (Excalibur, Clash Of The Titans 2010) as Baron Godfrey of Ibalin, just to name a few of the most memorable.<br /><br />Brief Plot Summary:<br /><br />In the year of 1184, an illegitimate son of a Crusader Knight, named Balian, has just received a personal invitation, from his otherwise unknown father, to leave his hometown of  France and return to Jerusalem with him and his Crusader Knights. Reluctantly Balian agrees and begins to learn of his role as the new Baron of Ibalin. Seeking to receive forgiveness for his wife who had committed suicide and to redeem his faith in God, Balian arrives in Jerusalem to find it in a religious upheaval.<br /><br />A group of mercenary knights known as Crusaders defend Jerusalem  known as  \\"The Holy Land\\" from an Islamic people known as  the Saracens and  Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), leader of the Muslim forces, who claim to have been stripped of their right to the Holy Land over 100 years ago.. Now, with the majority of the Crusader Knights led by Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and Raynald of Châtillon (Brendan Gleeson), they raid and pillage under the guise of Christendom and provoke a war that could bring the peace treaty, kept in place by King Baldwin IV, to it's very knees.<br /><br />It will ultimately fall upon Balian to restore peace for not only the Christians and Jews but also for Muslims. If Balian is to accomplish this feat; he must turn against fanaticism caused by religion and resort to understanding the importance of free will and by making the right choices and preserving moral conciseness.<br /><br />Acting and Cinematography:<br /><br />The acting was very convincing by the entire cast and from the supporting actors involved. Most notable to me were Orlando Bloom who did not seem to remind me of his character from The Lord of the Rings and from Edward Norton who displayed much emotion despite being restricted of facial expressions by a steel mask that hid his entire face. The set locations were visually awing and become the focal point of making this film a three hour journey of pure \\"eye-candy\\". There are gorgeous landscapes and impressive costume designs that appear to be true/accurate to the time period.<br /><br />My Opinion Of The Film:<br /><br />I had seen the butchered version of this film when it first was released and was quite disappointed. This abridged version of the film left much to be desired. Epic battle sequences would consist of a large amount of build-up and then end just as quickly as they began. As an example; cuts were made in the middle of fight scenes and would end with a showing of the aftermath.  Huge gaps in character development made following the complicated story-lines difficult and combined with missing sections of the battle scenes only left much to be desired and not much to be remembered.<br /><br />When I first heard about a re-issue of this film in its entirety and as intended by director Ridley Scott, I became very excited and pessimistic of any real improvements. So often there are \\"Directors Cuts\\" that accomplish nothing more than adding deleted scenes and providing little depth to the plot or pacing of the film. I was very uncertain that this film would do any better. Proudly I can assure my readers that in the case of this film...that could be no further from the end result of Kingdom Of Heaven now shown in its entirety. Plot pacing and character development is improved ten-fold. Scenes that did not seem to make much sense can now easily be understood with great clarity.<br /><br />Let's face it; a movie that consists of so much plot detail and historical depth cannotbe rushed through and be able to remain \\"epic\\". This film and its story are truly epic in scale and vision. I was immediately glued to my seat the entire time and was on more than several occasions uttering the word \\"wow\\".  I wanted to see more of the battle scenes that were previously cut out and boy does this version deliver!<br /><br />Characters that I did not really care about before suddenly become important and provided me the emotional attachment that I longed for. Anyone who has seen the theatrical release and found themselves undecided whether to like or dislike this film... owe it to themselves to fully be able to make that choice. In the words of Ridley Scott during the introduction of this version cannot be stated any better and further expands my POV here:<br /><br />\\"When you're flying into the third act; there are some elements in here that some people might argue as being, too long or take too long to get there, but I think you should see what it is and judge for yourself..\\" - Ridley Scott
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are absolutely amazing!!  My children love watching the videos on YouTube and request the cd every time we are in the car.  The best part - this music is loved by all ages in my family - from five years old to forty!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was a little overwhelmed with the scientific language.  Once I got past that it was good reading.  I would recommend it.

B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love the series. Gives me something to look forward to and back to the day of reading about all the characters.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I was expecting more.  It was a little gruesome.  The ending was a little disappointing, as well.  I'm hoping the movie might be better.

0385737955|4.0|When I started this book, I was completely confused. Seriously. The new lingo and the cryptic nature of the story itself had me thrown for a loop. In fact, I really didn't care for the story much because of it. But, since I picked this book for December's Dystopian themed YA book club topic, I had to finish it.... and I am glad I did!<br /><br />The book starts off a little slow in my opinion. Thomas is in The Glade but he has no idea what's going on. As the reader, you have to piece the puzzle together along with him. The author gives subtle clues here and there through slipped messages or fuzzy memories. But just like Thomas, you have to decide what to make of it.<br /><br />The characters didn't make a lasting impression on me. There really wasn't anything mind blowing or special about them. Seriously. Ok, two of them had telepathic powers, but that didn't even impress me. It actually felt a little weird, but given how bizarre this book was as a whole, I decided to just go with it. I will note that the creatures lurking in the maze were terrifying. I have never read anything like that before! It makes the minotaur of the Labyrinth seem like a fuzzy puppy in comparison.<br /><br />After I finished reading The Maze Runner, I discovered there was a prequel. Thank goodness! I highly recommend reading The Kill Order before you start this book. I had so many questions while I read The Maze Runner. Some were answered, but most were not. I think the prequel will help set the stage and explain why the maze was actually created. The ending of The Maze Runner tried to explain it, but it was too rushed. The best part of the book was crammed into 30 pages at the end.<br /><br />Which brings me to this book's saving grace: the ending. WTH. Holy crap. I was expecting some twist ending, but not exactly what I got. I really wish I could share what happened, but it would give away too much. Know this though, the \\"flare\\" that is discussed came up at Thanksgiving dinner at my parents' house. And no, it wasn't because of this book. My dad was discussing \\"survival tactics\\" due to EPM or CMB attacks... and so \\"that\\" flare was also mentioned. I was a little unnerved to think that about the amount of destruction that could be caused by an act of nature. And of course I mentioned that \\"I have a book for that\\"-- interest piqued instantly.<br /><br />I think boys might enjoy this book. It seems pretty geared toward them since the MC is a teenage male living with other teenage males in a maze. There is a good amount of gore and violence, so that also seems fitting. The other books in the series might be promising too. I am interested to see what happens, but I'm leery to read on. I hate sequels that feel stale, and that might happen with book two. I already know what the premise is, so not sure how the author can pull of any surprises. I don't know though, the titles do catch my attention, so I may try to squeeze them in at some point.s' house. And no, it wasn't because of this book.

B0001GMIOE|5.0|I needed a replacement battery for my G2 camera.  I had purchased aftermarket batteries in the past and they had a short life many times failing when I was on location.  Photos are money, so I decided to purchase a OEM Canon battery.  I know this will last a few years and put much cash in my pocket!
B00006AW2G|5.0|WELL WELL WELL. SO MANY PEOPLE UPSET ABOUT THE SONG LISTING ON THE COVER NOT MATCHING THE C.D.  HEY PEOPLE, THAT'S THE SAME WAY THE VINYL ALBUM WAS, WRONG LISTING ON THE COVER. CONGRATS TO THE REMASTER FOLKS FOR DOING IT THE WAY THE STONES WANTED IT! NOW, PROGRAM THE LIST TO MATCH THE COVER IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY. OTHERWISE \\"ROCK ON\\".
B002RVZV9U|5.0|Led Zeppelin is my favorite band, but recently I have been listening to more White Stripes and Raconteurs.  This was a perfect documentary to get more behind the scenes of their music.  Jimmy Page's and Jack White's creativity is amazing!  The Edge doesn't quite fit among these legends; I would have preferred to see Dan Auerbach with them.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Show has me hooked. Would have paid more since I can't find these few episodes on Netflix or on demand at this time.
0345525558|5.0|It was a story that kept the reader interested in the plot and was a page turner.  I enjoyed it
B001QE1BDY|1.0|I guess I missed the fine print about the format of this particular dvd. I was unable to play it on my home dvd player. So, I wasted my money. If Amazon is selling dvds with different formats, then putting the particular format in big bold letters would have prevented this sort of thing.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I had this movie on VHS and had been putting off buying it on DVD, the Blu-ray is great. The movie looks great.
B001DSNELA|5.0|I refer to the years where Bond was played by Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan as the &#34;Lost Years.&#34;  I loved this movie in the theater and had to have it for my home. It has everything a Bond fan could ask for, the fantastic locales, the dialogue, the beautiful co-stars and of course the action. Well done!
B008I3R2VG|5.0|I love this album! I love it all!!<br />My absolute favorite is The Way it Was, followed my Here With Me, Deadlines and Commitments, Battle Born, and Flesh and Bone. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the songs are great as well! It is one of my top 5 albums of 2012.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My daughter is a Harry Potter junkie. She has read the books (we even listen to the audio books on long drives) several times and loves the characters and the world JK Rowling created. The movies, in my opinion, are like a highlight reel of the books. I've loved all the movies and it's great to have them in this compact package. There are really no extras, but my daughter hates DVD extras, so this was perfect - and a better price, too.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|When I was a baby Dumbo was one of my favorite movies we had owned on VHS and my mother told me stories that when we went to Disney Land when I was like 2 Years Old I begged to ride the Dumbo over and over because it was my favorite, and WITH GOOD REASON!!! this film is amazing! When each of my children were little babies I would sing the baby mine song from the movie and now my two year old is very enchated with Dumbo and LOVES the baby mine scene when ever it plays she gets me to hold her like Dumbo's mommy does for dumbo and sing right along with it. The most negative content in this movie is when Dumbo drinks a bale of water where a bottle of alcohol was thrown, and ofcourse gets drunk then they have the pink elephant scene which I personally dislike, but aside from that this movie is just wonderful I really recomend it.
B00124BNF4|4.0|Not necessarily in love with 'Best Of' albums, but having seen the Talking Heads numerous times during my younger youth I was inclined to add this collection to my iTunes library. Really glad that I did. You will be, too.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For the tiny price, this is a great tool to put a quick edge on just about anything.<br /><br />The sharpening angle appears to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 25-degrees, which I've found to be the ideal utilitarian sharpening angle. The carbide cutters are fast, and the ceramic stones are more than capable of putting a shaving edge on just about blade.<br /><br />Thus far, I've put a factory edge on the following:<br /><br />Benchmade Torrent<br />CRKT Contrial<br />CRKT Point Guard<br />CRKT Stiff KISS<br />Two cheap machetes<br />Two cheaper kukris<br /><br />With the exception of the machetes and kukris, each blade was capable of shaving a patch of hair off the back of my arm after sharpening.<br /><br />This is a great tool at a great price.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I like the way the writters can play with the sexual tension changing Watson to a woman allows. The addiction twist is also a plus.
B001GF8WPI|5.0|This is by far his best movie & along with a great cast Will is able to shine in a role that is unlike anything else he has done.  Maggie is also great in her role.  Do not expect the typical crazy humor that has made up his popular career so far.  This movie is very much different and we hope to see more from Will along these lines.  Yea, we still laughed but we were also moved.  Do yourself a favor and discard any preconceived notions; give this one a try.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down!!!Absolutely riveting, you'll never see the end coming.  Can't wait for the sequel, a must read for anyone
0060523808|5.0|I just recommended this to a friend, and it reminded me to write this review. If you enjoy a good business story, well-written, and not filled with charts and jargon, this is the book. There is really a great deal of good takeaways about running a business. I wouldn't use it as a sole blueprint of what to do, but there are some gems in there.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This is an incredibly insightful, well written book.  Every person that works with other people should read this book.  It will give you a new set of eyes and insight.  I've read many body language books before, but this one exceeds all others.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|...And that could be said for both the music itself and the box set packaging. This could have easily surpassed a 40 or 50 dollar box set, so I was amazed with how well put together it was.<br /><br />As for the music, WOW. This has been playing nonstop and each and every song is simply phenomenal. Other reviews detail each song so I won't waste my time doing that, but let me just say that this is one of the best albums put out by Kamelot, surpassing  by far (in my personal opinion) recent albums by Nightwish and Epica. Kamelot are at their finest here and their decision to bring on Tommy Karevik for vocals was the best choice they could have possibly made.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|sounds great and are full but these eat up battery life so I suggest you get some rechargeable batteries as I did. I got the Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable battery kit and they work great
B000O75VSK|5.0|All in all every song on this album is well written and even better preformed. Wow. In a way I am glad that this is the album that they released last, as it leaves a beautiful legacy that lives on through the metal world. Only two throwaway tracks (in my opinion) and overall a very solid release!

B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!  I love this game it is the best!  I have tons of worlds and I have amazing creations.  Nobody could ever match this game.  All those people try to make minecraft related games but they can't because minecraft is one of a kind. Some games like Survivalcraft are ok but others like blazecraft (I won't capitalize it because it stinks) and vicky vasilou products stink.  Do those people have anything better to do than to copy minecraft?  Probably not because they don't have lives.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I purchased this trilogy on Saturday night and I revived it today. So very fast shipping. Anyways I bought this for my husband for Christmas but he got the mail today and opened it and started screaming and when I asked what's up he said that this is the best trilogy set he's had ever gotten.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following the piano guys for several years now, from the beginning.  They continue to get better and better and the videos are so beautiful both for eyes and ears.  I'm so glad that they have taken music based in classical training and modernized it and made it appealing to younger people.  It would probably make them blush to hear that I know several girls in their teens who idolize them as if they were rock stars!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|The movie is a hoot and very entertaining for the whole family. I highly recommend this flick to all ages.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Really can't go wrong with finishing the trilogy. The last movie looked like it was ready for a batman and joker showdown, but with the tragedy that happened the story had to change. Still a great ending to a great trilogy, would be 5 stars if there was at least an acknowledgement of the Joker.
0446580848|5.0|Read the whole book in 10 days in between a full time job, housework and errands. Could not put the book down
B0063IH60K|4.0|Brill game I love any card game this app was fun and easy to use.<br /><br />I would recommend it any day .
B008Z9L94O|1.0|So, as many, many others here have stated, this VINYL release is a bad pressing.  I REALLY wanted to like this.  I listened to each side over and over again to determine if I could live with the issues.  Ultimately, I could not.<br /><br />Here's a list of the issues I could hear:<br /><br />-Bad stereo imaging:  Noticed this one right away.  WAY too loud in the left channel compared to the right.  Off balance.  Was driving me crazy the first couple listens and made me think my tracking was off on my turntable.<br /><br />-Distortion:  Most apparent on the song 'Zero' but evident throughout.  I noticed this right away as well.  You can't not notice it.  When I got to the last minute of 'Zero' I knew this pressing was defective before reading one other review stating the same.<br /><br />-Extremely muddy mid-bass:  This may be due to the remastering but it's nowhere near as bad on the digital version so I will attribute this to a bad pressing as well.  Some songs sounds okay but most end up being a muddy, garbled mess around the 80-120hz range.<br /><br />It's really a shame.  Unbelievably beautiful packaging, incredible album, all ruined by atrocious quality control.  I doubt we'll ever get a 2nd pressing that addresses these issues but you never know.  This one will sting for a while...
B0041T52S6|5.0|I watched this movie when one of my friends own it when it came out and I have to say it's one of most entertaining movies I have watched. Since I like video games, I know I appreciate a lot of the  elements playing throughout the movie, so for anyone who likes video games, they'll appreciate this movie.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|all Ken  Follets books always offer excellent reading , and I am enjoying the new one as well.  looking forward to the next book.
0345803485|5.0|Omg didn't expect to like this book so much recommended it and bought it for friends and family absolutely scandalous couldn't put it down
B000AARKOO|5.0|This story has it all, Love, Ideals, and a Happy Ending...:-)  I have watched this movie at least 5 times...so far, and that's why I ordered the DVDs...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I haven't read John Grisham in many years.  I like the James Patterson and other authors that do the shoot em up.  I think the Racketeer  is very entertaining, so much so that when I finished it on my Kindle I bought another book &#34;The Litigators&#34;.  John Girsham is a great author, love his sense of humor, I acutally laugh when reading his sarcasm.  I rcommend Racketeers as well as The Litagators.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I actually like some of it, but the story was not as engaging as I was hopping it to be. Not sure if I will read the rest of the books.
B000YHG72E|5.0|It's a wonderful family movie for any age.  It shows how we should rejoice independently for our external circumstances.  In the end if you persevere to be joyful, you will end up fulfilling the desires of your heart.
B00782O7NE|2.0|I was relly dissappointed with this movie.  We had company over and they did not enjoy it either Not impressed
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Thumbs up for this book...couldn't put it down, but did not want it to end..I am very pleased to recommend this book...
B009GESJH2|4.0|First: this review is coming from a long-time Kid Rock fan.<br /><br />Now, on to the review...<br /><br />Just when everyone thought the Kid had completely drifted away from anything pertaining to rock n roll, Kid Rock doubles back and releases \\"Rebel Soul,\\" an album that has Kid putting \\"Rock\\" as a definitive part of his name, sound, and mindset.<br /><br />Listening from beginning to end, it's the perfect CD for a smokey basement where guys are playing cards and telling exaggerated truths- the CD is all about women, drinking,drugs(nothing new for Kid)...but there's another aspect that's come along with Kid's age: reflection.  In between bragging about his sins, Kid also expresses concerns about the state of rock and how his vices have impacted his life- listen to \\"cocaine and gin\\" for an example.<br /><br />There's one thing missing from this album: one truly spectacular song/single. The CD is good, and Kid fans will definitely want to buy it. For indifferent fans, you'll at least want to listen to:<br />- Let's Ride(over the top in its patriotism)<br />- 3 catt boogie (classic \\"feel good, rock n roll party song)<br />- The Mirror (similar to \\"Only God knows why)<br />- Mr. Rock n Roll (surprisingly well-written<br />- Cucci Galore (Kid doing a Prince imitation?)<br />- Cocaine and Gin(deeply reflective)<br />-  midnight ferry (can't figure out this song- is it nostalgic? Melancholy? Regardless, it's worth a listen)
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Unfortunately I read the book before I seen the movie, so it was somewhat disappointing. But it does not reflect on the part of the acting of Miss Lawrence or the other wonderful actors and actress's. This was a very good movie, just compared to the book it leaves a lot to be disired as far as detail. I give it a five star because of the great acting and performance by those in the movie.
0756659841|5.0|My eldest grandson, who is into everything Legos, was thrilled with this book of stickers. Though I did not recognize some of the characters in the stickers, he was tickled that there were so many. Hopefully it will take him many days to use them all up. He and his little brother love stickers.
0439023513|5.0|It is a great ending to a wonderful series that is a must read, it is a little slow at first considering the two books before. But it is as good as the previous two that led up to it.
B007FG9LIE|1.0|Never tried to read a book that was so confusing.  I finally gave up on it.  I find it difficult to try to keep one foot in the present and the other in the future which this book attempted.  I went to the back to see if I could make some sense of it and still did not.  No way do I recommend it
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Had to watch it twice it was so great. Truth, wisdom and humor all put together in way for children to enjoy. The so called nudity scene, come on the short take of cartoon butt's is not something I would be afraid for my 2,4 or 6 yr old to see. This is a must see if you have a daughter, it is an inspiration to the strength of the so named fair sex. My daughter can do anything a man can do and I encourage her to follow her dreams where ever they may lead. Disney and Pixar really out did themselves with this one, I plan to buy this movie. It is one of those you share and watch over again and again, a new movie for my collection that few get to be a part of.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I love Johnny Depp and I like Tim Burton movies so overall it was good. Funny 1970's pop culture references but I think if I had watched the 1970's TV show I might have gotten more of the jokes. I don't think it will be one of the films I would watch again. Certainly not one I would watch over and over again.  It was worth the $3.
0439023491|5.0|All I have to say is if you don't take the opportunity to read this, it's your loss and those of us who haves gain.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome!!  This is an excellent series with good character development!<br />Awesome!!  This is an excellent series with good character development!
0439023483|5.0|All I will say is you must read this book if you want a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat and give you a place to disappear into another world that you will find is not so much unlike ours. And could one day be very much the same in many ways. Take a chance and give this book a read, you will find out what all the fuss has been about and be glad you did.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Entertaining game for free! Can't beat that in my opinion. The only down side is that I am addicted to it!
1419701533|5.0|specially for boy and all of family<br />loved this books . its incredible story and funny and make us smile.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My husband purchased this for the Kindle so I began reading it on my Kindle app on my tablet. I could not stop reading it. I was hooked from the beginning and was very glad that he purchased the omnibus and not just the first book.
B00355L2TU|4.0|i skipped straight to the highest level, and it is HARD.  i can't speak for levels 1 and 2, but level 3 definitely gave me a tough workout.  worth the purchase.
1452101248|5.0|The photo's, layout, and not least of all- recipes are phenomenal.  It's great for any taste, not just vegetarian.  Unlike most vegetarian cook books, it's not all about pasta, there are many ways these meals come together. The best part is the combination of ingredients, things you may not think to put together come out wonderfully under Ottolenghi's guidance.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|and close your eyes.....unless your driving of course.  Amazing and guaranteed to put you in that beautiful place.  I am lucky enough to live in St. George, Utah and feel the spirit of their music all around me.  Thank you Guys!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I use this App on my Kindle.  Its user friendly.  Note - when you reopen the App, it shows the most recent status updates, rather than where you left off.
B001D08SK0|5.0|Bought this for my son who is a big Miles Davis fan. He was amazed by the sheer volume of music. It was packaged wonderfully too. So much was included! This surpassed our expectations!
8866130915|5.0|Note that this is the pocket sized version, and that it has a soft cover (hard covers also available).  Sturdy and well organized.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|This movie is a wonderful classic to watch and to own. Got a really great price on Amazon. Bought one as a gift and one for myself.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Quirky, fun! We rented it because we love Wes Anderson. We weren't disappointed. Clever, witty, and true to his style.
030758836X|3.0|I really did like this book.  It was a little slow starting but once I got past the first couple of chapters it got very interesting.  It was a very good read but I absolutely hated the ending.  The ending killed the whole book for me.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Only five minutes into this game and I'm scared ----less. Best played at night with the lights off. It will hook you from the start. Hell, I'm afraid not to follow the hints!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|The added footage a real help to the overall story.  Should have left this stuff in, for the theatrical release.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|Which this game was longer. very calming game--took about 6 hours to play--which it was longer.  A must have for all gamers.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I keep this album of repeat daily. You melodic music fans will not be disappointed; trust me! This guy reminds me of M. Jackson and Maxwell.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|GREAt, very please with how fast the product came to my door step and it was also wrapped very well.
0374275637|5.0|As I read each new chapter, a light bulb went on, helping me to understand what I've been experiencing in my own mind.  So much makes more sense now!  With this insight, I feel (somewhat) better equipped to develop my potential.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|The product came very well wrapped and nothing was broken inside the case. The product arrived fast and on time.
B007V4530A|5.0|I had to give my first keynote talk at a teaching conference and read this book in preparation.  It is very helpful with specific ways to improve your presentations.  I'm thinking of making all of my regular teaching &#34;lectures&#34; be Ted Talks, using the advice from this book.  I initially borrowed it on my Kindle for free but then purchased it.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I really don't like games that are &#34;Free&#34; and then once you get into playing it you have to purchase cards or other items just to continue playing.  If you don't win anything except points or tokens (etc) playing the game, then why do you have to pay for cards to play. I really liked playing until it said I needed to buy cards to continue.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is the most wonderful CD I have ever heard! The recordings sound great, the order of pieces is well-done, and the people that make up the group are fantastic musicians. My new favorite group!!
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|This processor is great. It has wonderful overclocking potential, and, when used properly, can give your PC all the current-gen &#34;oomph&#34; that it needs. It requires a much more powerful cooler than the stock included one, however, and even then it can get very hot on any rig not stripped down. Would buy again, great price for the power.
B006OFN0SE|2.0|Leonardo is always good.  The movie was okay.  I was very suprised by the ending to this movie.  It's okay.
B004ZJZPWA|4.0|I have a special affection for Van Helsing!<br /><br />I saw it in the cinema a week or so after breaking off what had become a rather joyless engagement. This film represented everything that I had been missing in my life prior to the break up: fun, adventure, fantasy, overindulgence, the list goes on. Van Helsing put a big goofy smile back on my face!<br /><br />All that aside, this is a mad, silly, overblown epic, that you are either going to love or hate. Its a bit like Hudson Hawk, you either get it or you don't. This film is homage to the old movies, not to the books of classic literature. Performances from everyone are over the top, not just ham, but great juicy ham and cheese croissants. In particular, Richard Roxburgh deserves a Hamoscar for his Dracula. It is truly a masterpiece of hysterical overacting (which Roxburgh clearly is very aware of) and worthy of some overblown Broadway musical. In fact, Van Helsing the Musical could just work!<br /><br />Visually, the film is an absolute treat, castles, landscapes, costumes, props, (the ladiezz), everything.<br /><br />Can I recommend it to you? Yes and no. Like I said, you have to get where its coming from. This is not a film to engage your brain, but a fast moving rollercoaster of spectacle. If you are up for it, then ride it!
1781161097|4.0|This book has a lot of graphic content, is very collectable and definitely recommended for those who love science fiction
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This movie made no sense. I am a fan of the alien trilogy and predator I & II so I was expecting more. The movie ended and I had no idea what I just watched. I'd would watch Predators, another failure, 10x more in lieu of this movie.
0823015033|4.0|Is a book full of photographic references to create figures, it has very good tips and techniques, recommended for those who love making fantastic figures.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Its a neat little app for checking the weather when you need to, not when you get to it. Can't miss that big orange sun!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, John Grisham has done it again.<br />Great book, holds your interest all the way through. Would recomend it to anyone who enjoys reading.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I wondered what all the fuss was about and then I tried it. Just a few minutes with the Angry Birds makes me smile and thats not easy to do.  Thanks.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Ok I admit I had not seen any of the Alien movies prior to purchasing this but I am so happy I bought this!  The movies are awesome in Blu ray.  Great picture and great sound.  I am not one of the people that is unhappy when they upgrade movies to Blu ray and even add parts etc.  I know a lot are.  It seems to me that this set is good for both kinds as the original theatrical release is an option or you can choose the other version.  I am that person that is excited about getting Star Wars on Blu ray.  Different likes for different people.  I like the movies a lot.  I would recommend this and the price is great on Amazon.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Foo has moved to my favorite band status because of this album, great tunes, lyrics, singer, great energy! I'd buy this again.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I did not see these in the theater but I was anxious to check out the Blu rays.  The picture is great and sound is phenomenal.  I would recommend these to any Batman fan. The packaging is nice and a cool booklet is included.  I like it.
B0002IU988|4.0|I bought this for one song, bought it used for a buck or so, it was certainly worth the price.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys create amazing music! They take every song I am in love with and make it better. I could listen to the music all day every day, and the videos they have are beautiful, funny, and all around amazing too!
B001IF252M|5.0|very good simple and efficient.small and good size.  helps in presentation and is not heavy or cumbersome to use it
B0001I561E|4.0|My 7 year old loved his movie. It was difficult to find on DVD, but it made her so happy. It arrived faster than promised too.
0425263916|2.0|Second in the Crossfire psychologically obsessive series that wants to be a BDSM book like the Fifty Shades series.<br /><br />My Take<br />Well, I guess that line above pretty says what I think... Day may want to publicize this as being a BDSM book, and it is about control. And whining. Lots and lots and lots and lots of whining. Oh. My. God. The whining that Eva tortures us with. Obviously, Gideon has a sexual problem. Her name is Eva. I would never put up with someone like her. Give. Me. A. Break. It's gotta be love. Nothing else would get me to put up with her insecurities.<br /><br />While both main characters are messed up psychologically, it's Eva who takes the spotlight with her insecurities. She keeps breaking up with Gideon, then she goads him with a past lover. Of course, Gideon isn't helping as he's trying to keep her safe without terrifying her.<br /><br />Will someone please just hit the woman over the head!? She can take the most innocent situation and blow it so far out of proportion that I want to throw her out a window. She talks about how the payment for being with a wealthy man is the long hours they put in, but then turns around and is angry because Gideon has to put some time in, so he can take time off to be with her. Then she pisses me off with her insisting that Gideon spill everything about his past. This after her own experiences with having to deal with her traumas. What? People aren't allowed their own pace? It all has to be on Eva's timetable or you're outta hyah! Gimme a bat! It's all me, me, me, me, me. Argh, she's such a CHILD.<br /><br />Admittedly, Gideon doesn't handle things all that well. He finally gets how crazed Corinne makes Eva, and he knows she follows his every move with a Google Alert but he still doesn't stop seeing Corinne.<br /><br />I do like her insistence on having a \\"friendly framework\\" in place before she falls into bed with a man. She's had some really hard knocks and is working to respect herself more.<br /><br />It takes a knock-down, drag-out fight before Gideon understands how Eva feels about Corinne always insinuating herself into Gideon's life. Of course, Gideon isn't actively kissing Corinne. Now, why doesn't he just tell her what's going on? This always irritates me when one side doesn't warn their loved one because they \\"want to protect them\\". Well, knowing helps, although, if Eva had known, then Day would have had to find something else to write about besides all the whining.<br /><br />The Story<br />It's happy families for Gideon and Eva as they prepare for a day of work. At least until Gideon insists that Eva accompany him out of town on a business meeting when she wants to spend the weekend re-bonding with Cary.<br /><br />Eva is determined to build her own circle of friends. To be sociable with people other than Cary and Gideon. So, when Shawna has an extra trio of tickets to see a band, Eva brings Gideon who, in turn, finds an escort for Shawna for the night. A hero of her and her boyfriend's. Only to run into someone from Eva's past she doesn't want to see. She so badly doesn't want to see him that she ends up kissing him like there's no tomorrow just to get back at Gideon. That's just so healthy...NOT.<br /><br />A stolen weekend gives the two time to talk. To just be together. A peaceful weekend until they get back and find out Cary is in the hospital after being beaten horribly. It's shortly after this that Gideon retreats from her. Starts seeing Corinne again.<br /><br />Then there's Eva's father's short visit. And the truth Eva discovers about her mother.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Eva Tramell works as an advertising assistant at Waters Field & Leaman and, as much as she loves Gideon, she refuses to be at his beck and call. Cary Taylor is Eva's best non-sexual friend. He's gorgeous, a model, bisexual with a very wandering eye, and lousy impulse control. He's in love with Trey, a part-time photographer's assistant pursuing a degree as a veterinarian, and trying to get back together with him.<br /><br />Gideon Cross is one gorgeous hunk of billionaire, and he's obsessed with Eva. Too obsessed as he wants to control all her moves. He also has one heck of a sleep disorder in which he flashes back to his own disturbing sexual history. He owns and runs Cross Industries and is headquartered in the Crossfire building where Eva works.<br /><br />Angus is Gideon's driver. Ireland is his half-sister and she worships him. Chris Vidal, Jr., is a half-brother and hates Gideon. Elizabeth is his mother and she didn't support her son when he tried to tell her the truth.<br /><br />Arnoldo Ricci owns Tableau One, a restaurant, in partnership with Gideon. Dr. Terry Lucas is one of Gideon's enemies, mostly because of the revenge Gideon took against him with his wife, Anne. Magdalene is one of Gideon's friends who had hopes of getting a ring from him; she was vicious to Eva in [[ASIN:0425263908 Bared to You (Crossfire, #1)]]. Corinne Giroux is an old flame of Gideon's: his ideal. And Corinne wants him back. Sheila is a bodyguard Gideon sics on her while she's in Las Vegas. I do love how Eva gets him back!<br /><br />Eva's Co-Workers at Waters Field & Leaman<br />Megumi is the receptionist and one of Eva's friends. Mark Garrity is her boss and he's partners with Steven Ellison, a contractor, in his personal life. Shawna Ellison is Steve's sister and her boyfriend Doug is in Sicily. Will is a new hire whom Eva is helping.<br /><br />Eva's Family<br />Victor Reyes is an Oceanside, California, street cop and Eva's dad. Eva's mother, Monica Tramell Barker Mitchell Stanton, is a neurotic trophy wife. The neurotic mostly stems from what she learned about Nathan. She's currently married to her third husband, Richard Stanton, another very rich man. Martin is Richard's son. Benjamin Clancy is her stepfather's personal bodyguard.<br /><br />Nathan Barker is a former stepbrother who molested Eva when she was just a kid. Dr. Lyle Petersen is Eva's mother's therapist and now hers and Gideon's. Parker Smith is a Krav Maga instructor with whom Eva trains. Brett Kline is an old boyfriend of Eva's. And the lead singer for Six-Ninths. Turns out she's his muse. She's been inspiring his songwriting for the past four years.<br /><br />Detectives Shelly Graves and Richard Michna of the NYPD question Eva and Gideon about a murder<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is very Fifty Shades-inspired, except in warmer colors. Gradated browns create the background for a silver keyring engraved with a \\"GC\\" while gold creates an embossed title.<br /><br />I suppose the title is Reflected in You, with \\"you\\" meaning Gideon's neuroses are reflected in Eva's own whacked-out neuroses.n, and trying to get back together with him.<br /><br />Gideon Cross is one gorgeous hunk of billionaire, and he's obsessed with Eva.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was very dissappointed in this book. I read it to the end only because i knew it was going to be over soon. Well it didnt end! I will not be buying the next one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book!  I was told I had to read it, then I could not put it down.  Letting my daughter read it, and she loves it!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Typical Grisham.  Good read in a waiting room.  Grisham should spend more time on fewer books instead of less time on more boooks.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|This is a terrific best of set. I liked the new songs .I would have liked to hear more new material.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Action packed,great story,zombies,death,fear,great acting,excellent surprises. I was surprised at some the scenes can be a little gruesome not for any one under 15yrs old.
030758836X|2.0|I loved how the book started, and the plot thickened till the twist in the second chapter turned it all upside down which was great. However, later on the plot became so weak that my inner Stanislavsky did not even bothered to shout \\"I don't believe\\" - it was beyond unbelivable. I skimmed through the rest of the book just to know how it ends. Can't say that I was disappointed because I already read unfavorable reviews and was half-prepared - and yes, they were right.
1608862801|5.0|Ryan North (writer of the wildly amazing Dinosaur Comics) does a great job adapting Pen Ward's insane style to the page, while still making it his own, particularly through his use of bottom-of-the-page alt-text (similar to how he does his webcomic). This book captures everything that is good about the show. A must-read for Adventure Time fans of all ages.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Her songs are just so fun to listen to.  She also has a message if you listen to the words.  Wish I had heard Dear Mr President a whole lot earlier.  I lean towards Christian Rock and R&B, but am loving this.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I really enjoyed this! As good as the 1st movie and leaps and bounds better then the 2nd. It doesn't have as much of Tommy Lee as I would have liked but Josh Brolin did a fantastic job.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Well written. Many twists. Lots of Action.  Blu-ray is the way to go.  Still think Heath Ledger as the Joker was a better actor than the guy playing Bane.  New look at the Batman after being taking a beating and the fall for Harvey Dent / Two Faces crimes.
B005LAIHR2|3.0|Silly story, Great songs.  Not much character building.  Be prepared to laugh and enjoy the ridiculousness of it all. One more word - Don't expect much
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book kept me wanting more as I read this within a day's time. The relationship that was Megan and connor was sensual and amazing
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Fascinating description of an unforgettable experience, explain in plain words by a scientist that has the knowledge of the intricate brain. There is life after death and God in is infinite love is waiting for us to be with Him for eternity.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Felt like they spent more time on the violence than the character development. It's a pretty interesting story, this part of American history. I wish I got so see more of that. Kind of a waste of some pretty big talent. Gary Oldman's character is great. The wrap up also felt like, &#34;Well, we've blown up everything and killed off the pertinents, so... let's wrap this up with a  quick VO that covers the next 10-15 years summation...&#34; That said, I went to MovieLand. I enjoyed the ride.
B0096CDG0O|3.0|I've played the Free version for a while now. Just got the paid version from App of the Day. Well now I can't get the app to logon with Facebook so I can't play now.<br />Via Note 2<br /><br />Please FIX
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer story Wow  had me going for a long time until it came together.  Excellent and exciting all the way through with a surprise at the end..
B00992CF6W|5.0|it all most like minecraft for Pc but it don't have redstone and traps and it don't have buttons but it still a good game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love BBC productions, esp. period pieces. This series meets the expectations. Great story line, good continuity with the first season, very good acting, etc. etc.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|A classic movie that will be watched in our family for many years to come.  Wonderful storyline, great adventures, and emotionally moving.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought for my daughters new ipad.  She loves this book.  Very easy to download and I would recommend the read to anyone.
B00005NPWA|5.0|I bought this to replace a missing eyepiece on my Voigtlander Bessa R3A Rangefinder. Turns out some Cosina-made cameras share eyepiece dimensions with those of Nikon FM, so this eyepiece fits perfectly. There is no magnification to this eyepiece which was nice too; just a good replacement.
B00899F0G8|4.0|I watched it with my teenaged daughter and we both enjoyed it. Content bothered me a little. 16 year old girls having sex and drinking alcohol? I used it as a chance to discuss life lessons with my daughter and we had good conversation and watched a very suspense filled show! We both enjoyed it very much.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|I love this film. Very unique and the story line is great. Cameron is PERFECT for the part in this flick and can't picture really any other actors fit for the role. Lots of cussing, sexual implications, and some drugs. But makes for a great date movie or just something funny for you and the friends. :)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Five stars is an awfully high rating to give a book or a recently released movie. As I have read the book and seen the movie I feel justified in awarding the movie and the book the highest rating available.  And both Yann Martel and Ang Lee deserve the highest of praise for their work. Yann for bringing the book into existence and making it an example of literary excellence and Ang Lee for taking the book and making it into a believable story and gorgeous film work! Overall you could not have asked for more. Usually I hate to go and see a movie of a book I truly loved because I'm afraid the film maker will screw it up. I was very afraid of that with Brokeback Mountain.  But I could not have been more wrong!  Ang Lee showed himself to be a true interpreter of the material in the book. He has done it again in Life of Pi. I don't know why I doubted his ability to translate the material to the large screen. Because he does it with his usual virtuosity So if you like to read....get the book: it's excellent! If you go to the movies...don't miss this one: it's spellbinding!
B001KZG99A|5.0|Fun, witty, action packed. Very fun movie. I can see this series going on for quite a while. I definitely recommend
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I wish I had read this book before. It's such a little treasure book. Thank you Amazon, for recommending it.
0385732554|5.0|Every middle schooler should read this. And if you are past middle school - you should read it too. A great introduction to challenging the environment you live in by asking questions.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the way I get to pick the background and the backs of the cards! Of course there are also the standard solitaire settings like draw one or draw three cards, timed or not, and it keeps track of win loss stats. The only problem I have with it are the ads, but for a free game there aren't tooo many of them.
0060899220|4.0|For those who only watch him on his show &#34;No Reservations,&#34; be careful. While I enjoyed this book a lot, it travels a bit deeper into the culinary world - and those who don't have interest in the service/work side of food service will likely find it bland. Also - as always with Anthony Bourdain - not for those easily offended.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I rated this game high as I think the graphics are wonderful and so much fun to look at. I also like the storyline. The games/puzzles are fun and not too difficult, but difficult enough. I enjoy games that make you think. I am pacing this game as I don't want it to end too soon. Hope there will be more like it.
0380730405|4.0|A wonderful book for many audiences - a mysterious tale that changes with you as you grow and re-read. Beautifully written
B004NELBPC|5.0|Keeps up with the News online better than any of the others.<br />Let's us know who are the Bad Actors in our Democracy.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I'm in college and broken iPhones on campus are practically trending..So I bought a white case the moment i bought my iPhone and I am in LOVE. The only issue I have is that it's .. well.. white .. so as much as it's life proof the dirt shows up pretty easily. I plan on getting a pink one soon (didn't know it came in different colors!) to replace my messy looking one. I can confidently toss my phone in my bag with all of my textbooks and laptop and know that it survives rolling around in my bag. I've also bought it swimming and some people complain about the sound changing after using it in water, or sounding fuzzy, all you need to do is blow a little bit into the speakers on the bottom and it works fine!<br /><br />The only warning I have is that you really need to understand the installation process and care of the case, but Lifeproof provides detailed videos and instructions. And you have to sign up for the warrantee!  in the end with proper installation and care the phone is well worth the money.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series was everything I expected and more.  While it was a little uncomfortable and predictable at times, I couldn't put it down and can't wait for the movie.
1419705849|5.0|My 9 year old grandson absolutely loves this book, it is so funny that he can't stop reading it.  It is such a pleasure to see.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is an absolutely fabulous mix of old and new, classic and modern music. The ingenuity of their music and the selection of the songs they feature is unsurpassed. In a way it is as if they have created a whole new genre of music with their mixes. It is inspiring music that I love to listen to again and again...
B004K4IZ54|5.0|This is a great 3D movie that's beautifully done & worth watching times & times again. It's a collector must have.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really like this game it is entertaining I start playing and the time flies by one thing I don't like is all the needless steps you have to take  to get to next level after you cleared the one before
0385536828|3.0|Haley's award-winning fictitious book is so derivative that it ruined the plot line for me.  I just couldn't believe in Haley or Serena.  But I do hope she accepts his offer after so much wasted time on their affair.  This is a very literary book, and I'm not sure it's for all readers.
0061733199|5.0|only book i own and i read it front to back then back to front and then threw it in my b.o.b. only book i would ever need if shtf, plane and simple. its also good for everyday situations. and for your girly men itll help put some hair on your chest you might learn a thing or two and actually be able to keep your self alive long enough for someone to find and or help you. that is all
B000FBFMFW|5.0|I started the Farseer Trilogy after reading Robin Hobb's dragon books  -- and I've become so hooked on the Farseer books that I haven't yet had a chance to go back and read the last of the dragon books.  ANyway, this second in the Farseer trilogy is excellent.  I stayed up until three in the morning reading it, and I can't wait to read the third in the series -- which is already on my Kindle.<br /><br />Robin Hobb is quickly becoming one of my favorite fantasy authors!
0786956291|4.0|Not really much to say about this other than it is for people looking to start very basic role playing.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really appreciate that the show used the 'very special christmas episode' format to introduce a new character that was able to highlight the dynamics behind all the relationships and conflicts - and it was both bloody and fun.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|First rate story and beautifully animated.<br /><br />Up to par with DC animated films that I've seen so far.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Must buy.
B004I8WD7S|1.0|Cheaply priced and cheaply made. The case just doesn't protect the phone...the plastic is too thin. The front protector is almost impossible to get on with bubbles showing up.
B005LAII12|1.0|Neither myself or my husband could deal with more than 1/2 hour of the vulgar language.  About every other word was a swear word plus a lot of sexual references.  This movie could have been down without the vulgar language, etc.  I would never want my grand children or children to watch this movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE ThePianoGuys!!!!  This is the best album and it hasn't left my car or iPod since I received it.  They are the best thing to happen to music.  You will not be disappointed.
B009H442DG|1.0|Unremarkable talent, sorry I purchased it but I expected so much more from all the hype.  Way too self promoting.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors. I love reading about Harry Bosch. I have read all of his novels and am anxiously waiting for the next one.
B001AVCFJM|3.0|I tried to view this film with an open mind but it was clear from the start that this new version was not going to please me.<br />  As a single film on it's own it's ok but this film contradicts far too much of the original series. creative license went too far.<br />  Those of us who are familier with the original series will see the differances right away, such as the fact that the original \\" Bones \\" McCoy was from the south, this new version was not and the person chosen for this charactor just didn't measure up.<br />  This film destroys the planet volcun and kills off Spock's mother, both are very much alive and well in the original series. It really went wrong for me to see this new spock having a romantic relationship with uhura, something that would never occur in the original series, neither would spock refer to his captain as \\" Jim \\" as Spock always tried to maintain his volcan side.<br />  Ther are so many blantent mistakes here that I just can't accept this version. It does not belong in the star trek franchise.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I love Shinedown.  I dont think they could release something that I didn't like.  They are never disappointing! Try it you will love it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a fun time killing game love to play during break in class or waiting for a plane great app easy ans fun to play little kids live it!!
B0079R8IYW|2.0|Lightweight and protects good but kickstand slips and falls down with slightest touch.  I wanted something to be able to watch movies with. I guess I'll kept looking.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince does it again.  I love the Mitch Rapp character.  Of course, I love Brad Thor's character Scot Harvath too.  I have to believe that this stuff is all overblown, but man it makes for great reading.  That said, Vince and Brad have created the CIA's composite of MI-6's James Bond.  Great thriller reading.
B008CLI3TE|4.0|never read the books. im a tolkien fan and the fantasy theme, so this series is not dissapointing. cant wait for second season!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This story moved a little slow for me in the beginning. Just as I was starting to give up it turned on a dime and I couldn't read fast enough. Great story.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|This is a gift for my daughter. Just the movie she asked for and I am so please that I was able to get it on blu-ray. Thank  you.
0810994739|5.0|My grandson loved the book.  it arrived very quickly and was exactly as described.  i will do business with them again.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|I got this game when it was free and didn't play it for a cop of days and I wish I had. It's awesome! Love the new take.
0896898288|5.0|the book is great and arrived very quickly.  I've already started making my quilt qsuares shown in this book.  i love it!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|A great user interface to get all your news in one place.  It's easy to use and you can set it up by adding the sites you like to keep up on.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Short and simple: I love these headphones. The only problem I have is that the coiled cord beings to uncurl and knot up in some places (after a few times on rolling in back up). The pads have started to flake a bit too. Amazing sound quality nonetheless. Perfect for audio mixing and editing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed it thoroughly. A good story that kept me wanting to read more, and I'm not much of a reader.
B005FISC52|4.0|I love this show and couldnt wait to watch it. I got half way through the last disc and it wouldn't play. I put it into my computer and it played so I'm not sure if it was my dvd player or the disc. I've played other discs in my dvd player and they work just fine so not sure what happend.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is beautifully written but is also a page turner. It keeps you engaged from the start and wondering at the end. I especially enjoyed his discussion of religion which was quite numerous.
1603580557|5.0|A wonderful presentation of ideas, feelings, and experiences. What passes for &#34;systems theory&#34; these days has changed from its original set of applications. Too often, scholars, analysts, and practioners have used systems thinking to justify an idea retrospectively rather than as a tool to learn from the past and guide some limited future action. What the early systems thinkers wrote about became tools for thinking rigidly. Meadows knew all about these traps, and she does a great job of explaining the limits as well as the advantages of systems thinking. My guess is that those who are completely unfamiar with this approach will find some of the first chapters confusing. Systems thinking is interdisciplinary thinking, but most of us learn about it within a discipline. My advice is to learn about systems ideas within your field of interest first, then rush to buy this book.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Terrific series - DVD clear and easy to understand dialogue.  Quality of DVD is good - Looking forward to season 2 when it becomes available.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was a bizarre book.  I had no idea what was going on until the last few pages.  Not knowing what was going on can sometimes be fun, but not in this case.  The book loses you and you wonder why you are reading it at times.  As a die-hard Grisham fan, I was definitely let down, but I will continue reading his books.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly is at his best in this Harry Bosch novel.  It had just the right amount of &#34;Bosch Hummanity&#34; in it.  He was a good dad, an okay partner, a pain to his boss, and brilliant.  A little stretch with the ending, but I really enjoy reading Connelly's work.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|This is a Funny and entertaining movie. I love Judi Dench  and Maggie Smith they are both wonderful artists and actresses
B007D5E7C2|5.0|these are the type of movies that you just like to watch a few times a year even though you already seen them. Uma Thurman rocks and the dry humor is just hilarious. I wished they would make some more of these movies. Quentin Tarantino did a great job with this franchise!
0061733199|5.0|The amount of info in this little book is awesome. I loved watching the pictures come to life as my children built the shelter, traps/snares, etc. I think everyone interested in bushcraft should own this.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Very pretty and cute. But hate having to take so much time to build up money or bits.  Not a fan of being tempted to pay real money to get extra play coins.  Games of toss ball and Apple catch get monotonous.  Still, I do enjoy it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn keeps pumping out timely, cutting edge works that keep his readers waiting for more. I eagerly await his next.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|First I read all the Shades Trilogy, but I had nothing else. Heard about the Bared to you, read it fell in love with the Crossfire Series, Sylvia, and definitely Gideon and Eva! Can't wait for the next book!!!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Love the complexity of David Mitchell's writing and appreciate the research.... windows into the past that you also are living! Personally prefer his setting in Asia and the Pacific, so rank this equal to &#34;The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet.&#34;
