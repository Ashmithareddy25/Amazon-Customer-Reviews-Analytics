B00008CLOA|5.0|I just wanted to say to the reviewer who disputed the word &quot;the&quot; that I have a few versions of this album including the original 1973 vinyl release, and the title is and has always been &quot;THE Dark side of the Moon&quot;.
B000000WHH|5.0|No matter how many times I listen to this album, it is still one of my all time favourite albums. <BR>I like all the songs individually and collectively in Colour by numbers. It's a pleasure to listen to it.<BR>If the song &quot;Colour by numbers&quot; had been included, the album would have been even better.
B000002UBU|5.0|This is a timeless and classic CD.  I just have to put in my two cents.  The others have said it so artfully and wonderfully.  Basically, I can listen to this CD in its entirety with no thought to length of time, or anything else.  Every single song is poetic and wonderful and great to sing to.  It's calming and a little sad, but also uplifting.  He is extremely talented.  I thank him for making this CD.  If it isn't part of your collection, it should be.
6305546789|5.0|HALLOWEEN REDEFINED TERROR!  OTHER THAN PSYCHO, WHICH IS ANOTHER FAVORITE OF MINE, HALLOWEEN IS THE MOVIE THAT STARTED IT ALL!  IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!  IT IS SO GREAT AND SO SCARY!  IT WAS, AND STILL IS, IN MY OPINION, THE BEST HORROR MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!
0060536977|4.0|I`ve always liked the length of Crichton`s novels. Not too long, not too short. Just right. This one is no exception.<br />The science behind his latest novel is painstakingly researched, although not 100% correct at all times. I`ve heard numerous scientists in the various fields touched upon by Crichton in his many novels complain about this. To the casual reader, this isn`t all that bad of a problem, though.<br />Prey is told through a first-person perspective, and although not one of his best, is deffinitely classic Crichton style. Once Jack is flown by helicopter out to the 'Fab Lab' the action is non-stop. At times a bit spacey and unbelievable, but always fast, fun, and entertaining.<br />Pick it up if you`re already a Crichton fan, and if not, pick it up and become one.
B00004XONN|2.0|Honestly, I was never much of a Radiohead fan, be it back in 1993 when a couple of my friends started playing &quot;Creep&quot; off of MTV's compilation, or when those same friends tried to introduce me to Amnesiac.  However, I thought I'd investigate their middle efforts and see what's been the big deal.<br />Listening to Kid A, I don't find anything particularly engaging.  If you listen to &quot;Right Place&quot;, you expect some goal for trudging through it.  But through the rest of the album Radiohead doesn't convey a clear purpose to their music.  <br />I don't expect the band to &quot;be&quot; anything, and I'm neither a fan that fell off nor a blind defender.  But after this listen I wonder if the praise HEAPED on Radiohead isn't as formulaic as the rock against which Radiohead purports to rebel.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Linkin Park is back with more quasi boy band metal. Seriously though, on one of the songs the singer sounds like he's doing a Nick Carter impersonation, i think its number 6. Anyway, I didn't expect this to be much better than the awful Hybrid Theory. It's virtually Hybrid Theory II, if not slightly more experimental. My problem with Linkin Park is that while the music is tolerable and sometimes they come up with some good hooks, the vocals and the lyrics are horrendous. Chester Beningtons screaming sounds more like a poodle being strangled and the rapping is just plain cheesey. He doesn't vary his delivery at all, it's the same in every song just different words. The lyrics are also the same in every song. You could interchange the lyrics between any two Linkin Park songs and barely tell the difference. If you're not into real music and just want to be kewl and hip like everyone else, then Meteora is waiting for you down at the mall.
B000002UB6|4.0|This album, while certainly is no Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road, is not a terrible piece of junk either.  It's become hip to bash this album, but it's often unwarranted.  Plenty of good and great tracks are found on it.<br />5 star songs:<br />Let It Be - a beautiful ballad by Paul, a truly fine song.<br />Get Back - A fun, bluesy song that sounds just great, especially with Billy Preston's solo.<br />The Long and Winding Road - A great ballad, overdone by Spector.  A great song, a little too made up.  Try the anthology version for an even better listen.<br />Across the Univerise - A great little number by John.  Well worth a listen, or two, or three.<br />Those are the great ones.  The rest, a few good, a few bad, and a few ugly.  But still, a very good album.<br />Not their best, not their worst.  A must listen if for no other reason to hear them at a unique stage in their historic career.
B00007L4LL|5.0|Everything that everyone else said is probably true, though not everything everyone said is spelled correctly....BUT Hugh Jackman is so perfect in this role it almost seems that he must actually be very much like that person. I rented a couple of his other movies:  X-men and Someone Like You, both entirely different personalities, and he was perfect in them too. They, like Kate and Leopold, were not actually great movies.  The thing is HE is and if someone will give him a chance he will be one of the best actors of all time. Besides that he is just a joy to look at.
6302373921|5.0|When I first saw this video it was 10 years ago.  I have to say that I watched it over and over again. I lost count of how many times I watched this video.  At the time I was borrowing this video so I had to give it back.  For years I had been searching for it until I found it here of course (amazon).  I was so delighted I didn't hesitate to buy it.  When I got it I just couldn't stop seeing it again.  This video is a classic.  Depeche Mode fans or not would definitely love watching this video.  One of my favorite sences is when David Gahan is singing to the audience and all of a sudden the light turn on and you can see the audience waving their hands to the beat of the music.  There was just so much energy that you can still feel it even thought it happened so many years ago.  Definitely a classic.  A must for the Depeche Mode fan.  I just hope one day this video come out in DVD and has extras.  That would be so cool!!!!!
B000089RVX|4.0|This album has both good and bad points, the good far outweighing the bad. <br />The good news: Amy Lee. She has perhaps the best voice to appear in this genre in many years. She is able to sign with power and emotion, something sadly lacking in alternative music. The rest of the band is extremely solid, supporting her well. Songs are well - written and deep, full of emotion. If you are looking for a \\"cruising chicks, getting drunk, sucking face\\" album, this isn't it.<br />Now the bad. At times there is too much heart-felt emotion going on. With a voice as powerful as hers, with a band as tight, do we need the number of ballads? This may be a turn off for some. To add to the shame of the ballads is that they tend to sound a little alike. You could very well find yourself skipping around looking for certain songs and avoiding others. I am sure the band knew what they were doing; I am not sure too many fans will enjoy the choice.<br />The long and the short of it is that the album is excellent, certainly worth the money. Just be ready with the remote if you are looking for a little more \\"pep\\". The songs are there, just look for them.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is the very first movie I've seen that not only depicts soldiers accurately, but it also shows military wives accurately.  I'm an Army wife of over 26 years, I was very moved when I watched this movie.  It is a tribute to the many, many heroes who serve our country.  It is remarkably done and the best I've seen as far as giving an overall picture of military life and combat.
0151008116|5.0|Some times there is a book that is so different from anything you've ever read...And when you find a book like that it is so exciting, so amazing, it renews your faith in the talent of writers still \\"out there\\". Life of Pi is one of those books for me. It was just so different from what I had been reading lately, it was like a breath of fresh air.<br />What I really enjoyed about the book was that I learned a lot about the habits of animals. Did you know that if a hyena becomes hot he will urinate on the ground to create a mud bath & roll around in it to cool off?<br />I also learned a lot about what to do if I was stranded in the middle of the ocean and how to survive. I didn't know that there are contraptions to turn salt water into fresh water. I found out you can kill a sea turtle and drink his blood.<br />I thought the author did a tremendous job of putting you in Pi's shoes and what it would be like to be alone in the middle of the Pacific ocean. How would you feel? His words almost brought me to tears. And the scenes where he had to kill for food, literally made me gag. His injuries due to exposure or lack of food made me cringe.<br />If you liked the movie Cast Away, I'd recommend this book. Or if you like adventure books. Or anything about human nature and survival. As the author boasts, this story will make you believe in God.
0679721037|5.0|Don't be fooled by the 5 stars, Hiroshima is not the best written, nor most challenging book one will ever read, in fact, in those areas this book does not even come close.  However, John Hersey's promise of opening the world's eyes to the horrors of the \\"bomb\\" is fulfilled to the very last sentiment in this classic book.<br />This book was simply a school assignment for me, I honestly can say I would not have read it otherwise.  Nevertheless, after reading it I began to question my indifference towards World War II, and even more- the threat of nuclear war.  Bombs like the \\"A-bomb\\" have never fallen on the USA, and that may be why most Americans don't blink at the mention of atomic warfare.<br />For those of you who have two or three hours to spare, and are interested in the chaos that about 10 pounds of uranium and 5 pounds of radium can create, this is a succint and timeless novel (which would pass for a mass-biography) which will hopefully remain on college and high school English cirriculums for years to come.
0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is a good book for people who are not living life to the fullist. People whose lives only revolve around work, money and material items. You will learn that life can be over before you know it. You need to learn to appreciate life, and live every day as if tommorow is your last. Morrie is able to explain all this even though he is dealing with a fatal illness.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought Norah Jones' CD last night and was in heaven for just a little while.<br />I'm no expert in music, but this seems to be a mixture of many types of music and various styles. However, Norah Jones has still managed to make it her own style in this CD and it's a pleasure to listen to. I'm very glad i bought it.<br />Still, this music isn't for everyone. You really just have to use your brain for this... it's just common sense! This is a slow-paced, jazzy CD. If you already know you don't like that style and will never learn to like it, then don't buy it. Know what you like and stick to it.<br />Raji
0060278250|5.0|beautifully crafted although not the best book in the trilogy it brought tears to my eyes when i finished it. i would recomend this book to everyone. it has a little bit of everything. i luvv it
0553278223|5.0|Some \\"classics\\" don't live up to the hype, but this groundbreaker by Ray Bradbury still deserves to be called a classic. There are few writers who can display Bradbury's sense of melancholy and creeping dread, and these qualities give the supposedly pedestrian sci-fi subject matter of this book an unexpected depth and edge. Sure the basic futuristic aspects of this book are getting rusty (it was written in the 1940's mind you), but the unique themes of interplanetary culture shock and social phobia are what make this book unique. We've all heard the term \\"ugly American\\" applied to obnoxious and condescending American tourists around the world, and here Bradbury extends the phenomenon to human colonization of Mars in the near future. The obvious parallel that Bradbury is making is with the European destruction of the Indians and enslavement of Africans. This is evident in the book's most haunting chapters concerning the mass death of Martians from human disease, and the haunting exodus of African Americans to Mars from the racist South. There are also many instances of cultural misunderstanding and conflict between the human colonizers and native Martians, allegories for the root of just about every social problem on Earth.  This book is essentially a collection of short stories or vignettes (not a full novel as is often assumed) dwelling on these concepts that are highly unique to science fiction, and remain groundbreaking to this day.
0823003035|5.0|I began learning figure drawing last autumn using the constructive, anatomical approach.  My main references were Bridgman and Peck.  I've always been a little suspicious of the &quot;holistic&quot; approach to learning art.  However, I kept seeing Ryder's book recommended so I decided to take a chance.  <br />The chance paid off; this is a great book and the top-down approach to figure drawing has improved my drawings in only a few days of work.  Anthony Ryder has a real gift for teaching drawing.<br />Having said that, I still recommend studying anatomy -- it's a great help to know what's &quot;under the skin.&quot;  My recommendation is to buy this book, copies of Peck and Bridgman, a little plastic skeleton, magazines with lots of pictures of people, and then practice, practice, practice...
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|ABSOLUTELY the most frightening, heart-stopping, chilling, totally believable, nightmarish, gorgeously filmed, stunningly scored motion picture in the genre.  The first time I saw THE FOG, I was so terrified, I actually stayed up all night on my bed in the corner of the room and pushed chairs and beds in front of doorways, stuffed blankets and pillows up against any vents or possible entryways because the fog outside was so thick and so dense, you could barely make out the street lights.  The music in this film, to this day, if I hear any of those tracks, makes me run to safety or sing a different song in my head if I can't get away from it.  THE FOG's score, written and played by John Carpenter himself, is so absolutely nightmarish and gorgeous at the same time, it is hard to describe.  You will be completely drawn into this spooky, chilling story and every emotion you ever wanted to feel in a horror film will take you over.  When the totally believable dear old grandmother steps out into the fog to see who's repeatedly pounding at the door at midnight, or when shipmates come up to peer onto a foggy deck at night because they hear strange noises only to see corpses standing mere feet away, or when they are laughing about the stories of a fog coming into town that is supposed to possess dark threats, only to look through the porthole and see a creepy, glowing fog on the horizon with the hopeless feeling of the lights suddenly going out on the boat in the middle of nowhere and the engine stalls... every single scene.... with that heart-pounding creepy music, plus the dread and utter despair that comes over your heart time and again in this movie makes it my favorite horror film of all time, hands-down.
B000089CPF|5.0|If you have been following Calexico for some time, picking up the tour discs and eps and singles and whatnot- nothing on this disc, save perhaps &quot;Attack El Robot, Attack!&quot; will come as any huge suprise.  Calexico have always dabbled in many genres- these guys are pure musicians- they play essentially without borders, taking their sound wherever their muse points.  This is the first time that one of their wide release albums has been so varied, so for some the effect might be a bit dizzying at first, but the band has a cohesive vision, and if you are in tune with that, you'll have no problem.<br />The real surprise on this disc is the super-tight songcraft, and the incredible production.  The instrumentation is denslely interweaved and crystal clear- new layers will reveal themselves with each attentive listen; really incredible.  The band says there are hours of leftover material from these sessions, so keep your eyes open!  The one downside of the disc, in my opinion, is the vocals.  Joey is singing with more nuance than ever before, so it seems a shame that they are often so quiet in the mix.  It is doubly so as the lyrics themselves are well crafted portraits of worlds of injustice and loss-  and they aren't given with the disc (less you wanna spend for the Japanese disc, I suppose).  I'd almost deduct a star for that, but a couple of negatively skewed reivews merit the disc all five from me, if just to restore balance.  And if you hunt around online, official lyrics have been pubshed...
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is so good it's great for little kids and adults who haven't forgotten what it's like to be a kid, in fact I only know one person who didn't like it and she is one of those adults who has forgotten what it's like to be a kid and she only likes to watch movies that are violent and depressing. Anyway this movie is awesome and it totally rocks! I highly recommed it for kids and for adults who can still allow themselves to watch a movie that kids love to watch!
B000003TA4|5.0|Should be on any top 10 list of greatest rock albums of all time.
B00005CDNJ|5.0|I am a 2nd generation ABBA fan and I have to say that I love this albulm. The song &quot;HAppy New Year&quot; was wonderful along with I let the music speak. those two songs I kept singing over and over again and All I have to say is that this CD is really good!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|\\"donnie darko, what the hell kind of name is that? Its like a super hero or something.\\"<BR>\\"what makes you think i'm not?\\"<br />Donnie darko is stunning, amazing and original. Although, most people who have even watched it 10 times still have no idea what it is acutally about. It's not really about saving the world or time travel, although they have a lot to do with it. Donnie Darko is about the search for god.

B000002UB3|5.0|Ive just read two of your reviews on Beatles material and although you have good knowledge about the albums I dissagree totally with your opinions. George Harrison was a fantastic guitarist and important figure within the beatles but to rate him as a songwriter above John or Paul is comical John and Paul wrote songs as good as Something time and time again you know that or you would not be interested in the Beatles.<BR>And the best musician in the Beatles was Paul he played piano, guitar, and co produced and arranged so much of the music. Also as a singer George was not as strong as either John or Paul. <BR>You would have been correct to say that George was the best guitarist. Obviously George is a favourite of yours but to say things like that about the two most influential people on his music is [not credible].
B00001U0DP|5.0|I've seen a lot of movies in my time, many of which don't deserve what they get.  This movie is one of the best I have ever seen, and deserves all it's acclaim.  It is at first a drama about the hardships of the Nazi Holocaust, but becomes a masterpiece about a father's love for his son.  Parts of this film will make you laugh, parts will make you cry.  All of it will change you.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Wow, you can definitely hear that the Linkin Park guys have come a long way since their hybrid theory album. First, I have to say that just like their first album all of the songs are great. On my way to school, like almost everyday I jam to this cd in my car. My favs include Don't Stay, Somewhere I Belong, Hitting the Floor, Easier to Run, Breaking the Habit, and Figure.09. This is most definitely an album worth getting.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Who says Baby Boomers can't appreciate good alternative rock?  Not only is she a talented singer and performer but her choice of material is tantalizing. Ever since I heard her on the famous NBA commercial (\\"Get the Party Started\\") I realized that this woman can get funky. And we Boomers appreciate some really good funk (Bootsy Collins, for instance.)<br />But she's not only a party girl. She writes plaintively of modern family life (\\"Family Portrait\\"), guilt (\\"Dear Diary\\") and, most effectively the right of every woman to just say NO to ... guys (\\"Respect\\") who demand casual sex.<br />I love Pink. But I did give the CD back. I just borrow it now and then.
B000059Z8J|5.0|All superhero movies bow down to this one. This is the best one ever to be made. My only complaint is that the remastered sound changed the sound effects of Superman's mighty roar at the end and it also changed the sound of him spinning around the Earth. I'm at a loss as to why this has happened. Other than that this is the best DVD that I own.
0060527978|5.0|I loved &quot;The Alchemist&quot;. The idea of pursuit, and ultimate achievement told in fable manner generated both optimism and hope for me. ANd the theme of the story &quot;When You Know What You Want, The Whole World Conspires With You To Achieve It&quot; is one of life's most beuatiful lessons.<BR>&quot;Warrior of the Light&quot; expands on the themes Coehlo set forth in &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, providing everyday lessons for reaching the enlightened status of The Warrior. It's a convenient to carry pocket sized manual, and is great to pick up for a moment's inspiration in the pursuit of dreams. The style of the manual is more of a meditation than The Alchemist, and the book is broken down into short paragraph form, allowing the reader to take a lesson, think over its implications and incorporate the action into daily living. Among the many lessons covered in &quot;Warrior&quot; are the value of failure (a key to all of Coehlo's writings), respect for the universal elements, living through your dreams, and acceptance of nature.<BR>I keep two copies of &quot;Warrior&quot; handy - one on my desk at work, and one on my nightstand at home. It is a great book to simply open, absorb and meditate on. And the lessons of the Warrior make for great living on a daily basis.
0446677450|3.0|Kiyosaki offers some wonderful advice, and illustrates it fairly well using asset and liabilities T-charts.  However, his \\"get rich quick\\" and \\"escape the rat pack\\" advice is nowhere near applicable to the general population.  His guidelines are useful for the rich - who want to get richer.  He outlines lucrative business ideas well - though taking an excessive amount of time to get to his points, and is quite repetitive.  Kiyosaki offers some interesting business and investing tips - but just takes too long to get to them.   However, these ideas are pertinent to the wealthy and upper-middle classes - individuals that are capable of investing large sums of money in new stock options and real estate - who are looking to gain some additional capital.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I love this CD, it's because of this CD that I've decided to learn Russian.  Now it's only fair to say that this CD has really only 8 tracks, track 9 & 10 are the real/Russian versions of the songs \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" and \\"All The Things She Said\\" and track 11 is an Extended version of \\"Show Me Love\\" which is track 3 on the CD. If I had one favorite song on the CD it would have to be \\"MALCHIK GAY\\" which translated into english means \\"GAY BOY\\" but that's my only personal chanson-de-choix.  I definitly recommend this CD if you like kinda-angry music, dance, and altogether great to me. Hope you enjoy it. Also if you listen to track 5 and like the theme song to \\"CHARMED\\" then you'll definitly like \\"HOW SOON IS NOW?\\".
B000089RVX|5.0|There isn't anything guitar wise on this album that stands out, yet the simplicity of the guitar riffs is part of what makes this album a pleasure to listen to.  Amy has a voice that is soothing, mystical, and beatiful.  The way each of the songs is pieced together makes each listen mind blowing!!<br />BUY THIS CD!!!  It will leave you with a sense of \\"wow, how refreshing, I need to hear that again\\"

0151008116|2.0|I never put a book down unfinished without a feeling of disappointment. I suppose what made putting away 'Life of Pi' much more so was the fact that I'd expected a lot from it. A teenager cast adrift with a menagerie of animals, taming a tiger at sea, this book should have been brilliant.<BR>But it wasn't.<BR>I'm still trying to figure out exactly what it was that made the story, despite all its promise, sink for me. A few people have commented that this book read more like a how-to-survive-at-sea manual than a novel, and I have to agree with them. I felt there was no light and shade in the book, even before Pi was shipwrecked, it just kept bobbing along at the same snail's pace the whole way through. Maybe it was that the book seemed to be all telling and no showing . . . there's only so long you can sustain shallow didactics on religion at the beginning of a story when the entire book has been marketed on its sea journey.<BR>Maybe the problem was that I felt the story had every pretense towards magic realism - the type that wouldn't have had the animals burst into song, but that they would have found some means to co-exist with one another. But that doesn't happen, and as a reader I felt cheated since that's what I'd been led, rightly or wrongly, to expect. Basically three animals are killed off (at the book's usual turtle crawl); my question then is why they were there in the first place. They served no purpose other than to show that yes, a hyena is a carnivore, and yes, a tiger is a big carnivore.<BR>But most disappointing for me was the character of Pi(scine) himself - I felt nothing for him as a character, either for or against. There was nothing to him at all; he's defined entirely by the circumstances around him, and we never get anything more than the glossed surfaces of his thoughts. I sympathised more with the orangutan than the main character.<br />Overall, I felt the book was shallow and painfully long-winded. The short-listed novels for the Booker Prize must have been pretty ordinary last year.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Pink is the real thing. When I first heard all the songs I knew that she is my newest favorites artist. She is so very cool and I can't wait until her next album comes out because she will surprise her fans again and again. Keep on rockin on Pink.
B000089RW0|5.0|Hey, it may not be the greatest scary movie, with all the great special effects, but i loved it! The story was great and it would make a great book. I'm not going to tell you what happens but the end was the best part. It wasn't as scary as i thought it would be but it is a movie that tells a story, and isn't so much a jump-out-of-your-seat-thriller because i think it isn't sopposed to be! I recomend watching it. If you hate it, you hate it. If you like it, you like it. :)
B00008LDPU|4.0|With the eagerly awaited The Matrix-Reloaded & Revolution, the directors have given us a treat to eyes & mind.<BR>These superbly made movies are a sure no-no-miss.<BR>They have already uploaded 2 of the movies on their website and coming up with two more (April'03 & May'03). And then in June you get to see all the 9 with Dolby 5.1.<BR>One of the movie 'The Final Flight of Osiris', can be seen with shows of 'Dreamcatchers' movie, by the makers of 'The Final Fantasy-The Spirits Within' is a animation blower (& also suppositely a prelude to the Matrix-Reloaded Movie).<BR>I can't comment on all the movies, but yes after seeing the two online ones I can say, you can't afford to miss any.<BR>The direction is superb, story line is superb. One of these include voice by Keanu (The Kid) & one with voice of Carry En Moss.<BR>I would suggest you to have a look at the matrix website (Animatrix section) to have an idea about all the movies. They have two liners explaining each of the Animatrix movie. Also watch the on-line movies before buying it.<BR>Some people, not very keen on Animation stuff, may not find it too cool. You can catch The Matrix-Reloaded then..<BR>You can run but you cannot hide from the Matrix fever.<BR>Matrix Has You !!
B00005JLH3|5.0|Let me preface my comments with my bias first:  I am a graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA, so the notion of a movie set on an historically black college campus (A&T-filmed on CAU's beautiful campus) gets points out the gate.  This movie, however, managed to do something that its ealier predecessor's failed to do:  entertain, educate, and rally the audience all at the same time.<br />\\"Drumline\\" is your classic story of a highly talented and cocky freshman coming into his own by bumping heads with authority and consequently learning to respect the differences.  Where this movie picks up major points is that it takes you directly into the heart of a culture (HBC bands) and helps to preserve on film to some and present to others something that has an awesome legacy in Historically Black Colleges and Universities.<br />There is something incredibly awesome about seeing bands battle on the big screen.  The adrenaline gets going and you find yourself cheering during the competitions.  When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I would have to see it.<br />Nick Cannon does a wonderful job with the main character, Devin.  And less we forget, the extras in this movie were totally on point.  I'm so glad that this movie was as well done and well received as it was, and I hope that Hollywood takes note and gives us more movies like this one.<br />Also worth mentioning, excluding some very light profanity, this is pretty much a good movie for anyone to watch, be it families, dates, or just friends hanging out.  I know that this DVD will be the highlight of my collection for a while.

B000008H1Y|4.0|As the title indicates, this album, along with Heavy Horses, is the \\"outdoorsy\\", free frolic through the woods side of Tull.  It definitely offers a different sound from their earlier bluesy material and the classic gems like Aqualung and Thick as a Brick.  The music on this album is as complex as their classic material but has a fun, frolicky quality.  \\"Songs From the Wood\\" proved to be one of Tull's trademark anthems, but my favorites are the free spirited \\"Jack-in-the-Green\\" and \\"The Whistler.\\"  \\"Velvet Green\\" is an intoxicating number about a handsome country man (\\"a young girl's fancy and an old maid's dream\\"-lyrics used in reverse on the previous album Too Old To Rock 'n Roll) who seduces a girl to sneak out.  The song is beautiful in a disturbing way.  \\"Cup of Wonder\\" is elevated by incredible piano riffs.  \\"Pibroch\\" is 8:37 and has the heaviest electric guitar sound of all the tracks.  The only song I do not enjoy is \\"Ring Out, Solstice Bells.\\"  The timing always bugs me, especially the clapping at the beginning. I usually skip this track.  In sum, Songs From the Wood is a very rich sounding album with more depth than Heavy Horses, which I also recommend.
B00008H2LB|5.0|To me, Meteora is an improved version of Hybrid Theory. I can listen to Meteora the whole way through without skipping anything, it's a catchy cd, and it has some great sampling in it. Linkin broken some new ground like the flute on \\"Nobody's Listening,\\" the strings on \\"Breaking the Habit\\", and the strings on \\"Faint\\".  The album isn't as musically daring as Reanimation was but it explores more musically than Hybrid Theory did. This album may not be a mind boggling album that changes the way you view the world, but it is still a good musical effort.  Sure it may be short, but there's no excess that sounds bad( in short, there's no horrible filler). So buy the cd because it is worth your money.
B00005IC2H|1.0|I read in USA Weekend that the Icelandic combo Sigur Ros is the antithesis of pop music as we know it. Well, I don't know about that, however, when I listened to this CD I felt I was at Forest Lawn's above ground burial vaults in the 24th century with the Cheribum and Seraphim taking peyote hits....what pretentious claptrap. I really tried to like it. I really did.<BR>But the more I listened ,the more vapid the &quot;music&quot; became. <br />I hate to throw cold water on this group and their fans but, and I kid you not ....BACK IN 1955....JACKIE GLEASON, OF ALL PEOPLE , DABBLED IN WHAT THIS SO CALLED CUTTING EDGE GROUP IS DOING NOW.<BR>The album was called appropriately OOOOOOOOOOOOOO. The long out of print album on Capitol had 16 songs and as far as I know never issued on CD. It contained great American Standards sung by just a vocal chorus. Which begs the musical question, whatever happend to the Marty Malvin singers?(the group on the LP).. No lyrics were sung and unlike the subject CD, they sang in tune. I do have the original LP in my basement vaults, I haven't played that LP in over 20 years...but it is considered a cult classic, especially when you see the album cover of a beautiful model's mouth with 50's period blood red lipstick pursing her lips as if OOOOOOOOOOOOing. Which only tells you one thing, a belicose &quot;bus driver&quot; (hey Ralphie Boy) in Brooklyn had more cutting edge musical qualities back in the 50's then this throughly pretentious, and I hate to say it kiddies, boring pop group. To paraphrase a song............<BR>Gleason had taste, Sigur Ros is merely the mock turtle soup.
B00005AQGH|5.0|2pac, Makaveli, The Don Killuminati, whatever he calls himself the fact remains that he is the greatest rapper of all time. This was his last masterpiece, a must-have for any true 2pac fan. The Intro is very harsh, 2pac attacks several east coast rapper's including Nas, Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z. Next comes \\"Hail Mary\\" which is one of 2pac's greatest songs ever, that's why you can find it on his \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. \\"Toss it Up\\" is more of a party track with a bumpin' beat and lots of R&B singing. Next is my favorite song on the album \\"To Live & Die in L.A.\\" a laid back track with a very nice beat where 2pac tells us why he loves L.A. so much. \\"Blasphemy\\" is kind of a dark track with a lot of emotion. On \\"Life of an Outlaw\\" 2pac & the Outlaws rap with a lot of energy that is balanced by a nice laid back R&B chourus. \\"Just Like Daddy\\" is a slower song where 2pac talks about treating women just like a daddy would. \\"Krazy\\" is a very good song with a laid back vibe. \\"White Man'z World\\" is a very powerfull track with an obvious message. The next track \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\" is great song, just ask Jay-Z. \\"Hold Ya Head\\" is a song that 2pac sends out to everbody in prison, telling them to keep their heads up. The last song \\"Against All Odds\\" is another diss record dedicated to the east coast (Puff Daddy is added to the hit list). Overall this is a classic album with no filler every song has a meaning.
B00000J2SO|3.0|This post-Dio release marks a detour from Metal Valhalla to a mundane AOR sound, trading art for the bucks. New aboard is vocalist Graham Bonnet one of the most underrated belters in rock's history. Blackmore and Bonett, along with Cozy Powell (drums), Don Airey (keyboards)and Roger Glover (bass, producer), excel on execution but fail on moving and shaking my skull as well as my emotional centers. &quot;All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Since You've Been Gone&quot;, &quot;Eyes Of The World&quot; and &quot;Lost In Hollywood&quot; are nice sonic works, but the final impression that I get from the album is somewhat sterile; the one you get from a simple entertainment product instead of the amazement you get from the artistic and sophisticated sonic landscapes of previous efforts. The beginning of the end.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Preface: I am writing as one who has owned multiple masters of DSotM, and write for a similar audience.  Therefore if you are just beginning with Pink Floyd, you may want to skim this review.<br />----<br />Even if you don't own an SACD player (I don't), you should definitely enjoy the benefits of this remaster.  I was quite surprised, frankly; I bought the remaster almost wholly for the artwork (which I find beautiful), not expecting much audio improvement, and I got quite a pleasant shock.<br />The improvement in clarity is extremely noticeable right from the first few seconds of the album: the effects of &quot;Speak To Me&quot; come in sooner and with greater clarity.  All of the other songs are greatly improved, especially the drums on &quot;Time&quot; (it almost starts to measure up to the majesty of the PULSE drums), and the entire song &quot;Money&quot; has had a HUGE increase in audio quality (this last I usually only listened to on PULSE because I did not care so much for the studio version).  So have the other tracks, but these are some of the ones that got my attention immediately.<br />The greatest addition is this one on &quot;Eclipse&quot;, previously only noticed by audiophiles: if you turn this album WAY up, after the words &quot;There is no dark side in the moon, really; as a matter of fact, it's all dark&quot;, you will hear music in the right channel, and extremely faint whispering in the left channel.  I was able to hear this on a cheaper portable CD player, with simple earphones, where I could NEVER hear it before, even on nice headphones.<br />All in all, even if you have not got an SACD player, this is well worth your money...the cover is not the only thing that has changed!
B000088E6D|4.0|Frank, Billie, Ella, Sarah, Carmen, Joe and other greats are no longer here. When young and new artists touch on the very songs that musical legends made famous, they never have intentions to<BR>compare with what 's been recognized as a definitive recording of a song. But when a song has endured the test of time and proven its virtue, it belongs to everyone , including young singers.<br />This album offers a very pleasant listen that goes with any occasions.<BR>The new life breathed into such songs as &quot;Put Your Head..&quot; and &quot;You'll Never Find&quot;  with new arrangements reflect  the spirits of the songs, arrangers and the singers. This album is not about the singer alone -but  several characteristics combined.  Of course, we still enjoy Frank and Louis and Ella but we shouldn't keep the door shut when younger generations want to come in.
B00001OH7M|5.0|This is David Bowie's self titled first album, released in 1969 (the year of my birth incidentaly).<BR> This little gem initially comes accross as muddled and strange but the sentimant really grows to become something quite special. Throughout the record Bowie uses some unusual guitar chords that often stray from the key making for rather interesting (though somewhat difficult and more often than not seemingly impossible to figure out if you're a guitar player) chord sequences as well as a classic nylon string guitar record. Interesting to note he's a bit fond here of the C chord with low G included to give a tremendously fat sounding compound wound string chord. <BR> The album is rather folky/hippy in style and VERY acurately reflective of the youthfull social harmony that swept through pop music in the late sixties and early seventies in America. There is some masculine desperation here and there, which is always a bit of a turn off to me. It opens with the classic song of the album title. A tremendously serious song giving vivid insight into being an astronaught (on a lone mission), when it was still a reletively new activity, so it feels rather historical - a time capsule in itself. A very good, prolific piece indeed.<BR> Three songs stand out as my favourites; Track 4 'Letter to Hermione', a desperate song of love lost to another, 7 'An occational dream', which compared to the former is a lovely and posative reflection of an ideal yet passed romance and the album closer, a brilliant and timeless hippy festival classic 10 'Memory of free festival'. This song is so discriptive in style and word of the era it swells your heart with sentiment, even if you weren't alive then. A genously picturesque discription of the hippy/Woodstockish era in the 1960s, described by Bowie in this song as a 'ragged and naive' time. Just beautiful.<BR> Another stand out song is 9 'God knows I'm good', a sad number telling of the desperation of an impoverished female shoplifter. Actually there's quite a bit of desperation of both genders here.<BR> One final note (and warning); This gem of a record is vertously wrechted by 3 '(Don't sit down)', a supposed half minute studio outtake. David Bowie puts on the most redicoulous and forced ... laugh which is nothing more than just absolutely embaressing. If you by this CD for god's sake burn yourself a second copy to exlude this stupid and cringeworthy track (for want of a better word).
B000002TP7|5.0|Ill Communication is one of the best B-Boys rap albums. While it still has its share of punk and alternative numbers, this cd has some of the Beastie's best rhmyes. \\"Get it Together\\" done with q-tip is a standout, as well as \\"Sure Shot\\" and \\"Root Down\\". \\"Sabotage\\" is a great alternative track, although it's not the same without the great video. Much of the rapping on this album is different from their earlier albums, focusing more on each boy having their own section and less switching off on rhymes. This change is welcome as it allows each of the boys showcase their own individual talent: Adrock's high energy, Mike D's sillyness, and Mca's cool raspiness. This is perhaps the strongest Beastie Boys album overall. I would recommend this or \\"Hello Nasty\\" (1998) as the first Beastie Boys album for the casual fan. And if you're a big Beasties fan, you should already own this.
0743244249|1.0|This isn't the DeLillo of 'Underworld', 'MaoII', 'White Noise' or 'Libra'. The prose of 'Cosmopolis', for a start, is mannered and laboured, with strange staccato rhythms. The insights into contemporary society have been replaced by platitudes that could have been churned out by any [one] at Wired. And if you're looking for the trademark sly, black humour, forget it -- 'Cosmopolis' is tedious and dry. What a great pity. It is not one's case that novelists shouldn't evolve and change (which is why 'The Body Artist' was welcome) but surely DeLillo is capable of much, much more than this disappointing, charmless volume.
B00008CLOA|5.0|The point of this review is not to critique the contents of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  In fact, few would argue the fact that it is a classic and an essential addition to any music library.  Instead, the point here is to review the quality of new SACD release.  I am happy to say it is magnificent and a huge improvement over the standard release.  Actually, this disc is a hybrid release, meaning that it has a standard CD layer and a SACD layer.  The first thing that I did was to listen to it on my 5-disc changer as a standard CD.  The tracks have all been digitally re-mastered and sound great.  Next I loaded it on my SACD player.  The difference is nothing short of amazing.  The music comes across with such three-dimensional clarity that by closing my eyes I would almost swear Roger Waters was in the room.  I dare say that I have never heard this \\"album\\" sound so good.  Finally I compared it to the copy that has been in my CD collection for years.  Here is where the sound distinction really stands out.  If you have recently upgraded your system to have SACD capability, then this disc is a must.  Even if you haven't taken the leap of faith with SACD, this disc is an improvement over previous releases.  Highly recommended.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is an wonderful film.  Intelligent, well directed, great acting, and deeply symbolic.  There is no need for me to go into detail here as I see many have more than adequatly described the plot and many of it's nuances.  More so, becuase many of the points raised don't lend themselves to discussion in the space provided ( in which on could hardly do justice to one of it's themes. )<BR>   On the otherhand, I will point out that, as many have stated, people love or hate this film.  ( some probably do both ).  I will not decend to the egotism of those who say if you don't like it you aren't bright enough to understand it ( not that I am not that egotistical) but I did notice that most of the negative comments seem to reject the films world view.  <BR>  Tyler clearly has a world view that many, particularly young ( perhaps predominently white ) men feel these days.  Lack of purpose, no worthwhile goals ( other than a cool new car or nice furniture ), a society that trys to create our opinions for us.  I unstand why this would bother some views.  They may not understand it, they may think that such people, the favored childeren of society, are just being foolish, or perhaps they are afraid of a world were people reject the comfortable values that make their little sterile and safe society possible.  ( More pessimistiacally, perhaps they fear the effects on accepting such values themselves.)<BR>  In anycase, the fact that one does not agree with the message of a film does not make it a bad film.  ( You may as well condemn The Ten Commandments for being about religion ) The acting is outstanding, the direction is marvolouse, the vast majority of the dialog is sharp and in many cases very insightful, and ( for those who thought it was advocating all those things that scared them so much ) it spends it's last act with the &quot;hero&quot; trying to stop what is going on and recognizing the inhumanity of what &quot;his&quot; followers have become.<BR>  Agree or not.  Empahize or not.  But if you open your mind you may gain some insight into how some people see the trap that their lives have become.  This film gives insight into the human condition of many young men in the modern world and, like that view or not, it may help you to understand some of things that drive people to the edge.  <BR>  - post script   am I the only one who thought that this was a modern Steppenwolf and that Tyler should have been a cute babe named Hermine?
B000069HK2|4.0|I'm not really into the whole emo screamo thing but I thought I'd give this CD a chance so I went down to my local record store I bought it. I had already head &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; on Mtv2 I I din't think it was great but it wasn't bad. As soon as &quot;Maybe Memories&quot; started up I knew this was going to be an awsome CD! Here is my track-by-track review of the CD.<BR>Maybe Memories-Pretty cool song, awsome chorus, I like the little guitar thing in the begining.<BR>The Taste of Ink-If you watch Mtv2 you've probably seen this video, it's pretty good but not the best on the album.<BR>Bulimic-My second favorite song on the whole album. The best part is the two verses, powerful.<BR>Say Days Ago-Third favorite track. Pretty cool.<BR>Poetic Tradegy-I need to give this one a little more time.<BR>A Box Full of Sharp Objects-By far my favorite song on the whole CD. Me being a fan of heavy metal I really enjoyed it when Bert screamed the whole second verse. &quot;Do you want a song of glory?&quot;<BR>Blue and Yellow-Not bad.<BR>Greener than the Scenery-Pretty good song, much better than Blue and Yellow.<BR>Noise and Kisses-Pretty good, not the best though.<BR>On my Own-Cool track, good guitar.<BR>Pieces Mended-Good Ending.<BR>Overall I think that this CD is pretty good. It's not the best thing I've ever heard but it's okay. Maybe if your a big fan of screamo you'll probably really like this CD. &quot;Found a Box of Sharp objects what a beautiful thing.&quot;
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I know that this cd is all marketing blah blah blah. Once you get past all of that and the girls act like lesbians on camera only, the music speaks for itself. Most groups do not write their own music that are famous. They have professionals do that. I thought the vocals were great, the background was thoughtful and the mixing was awesome. All the songs have a good beat. Listening to the music in Russian, however, doesn't do it for me. Maybe they were just filler. In any case buy this cd. If you like this cd, you might want to check out ATC - Planet Pop, another euro pop group.
B00008H2LB|5.0|5 stars is just not enough to rate METEORA. Linkin Park simply came out with another masterpiece, as if it was the most simple thing to do......<BR><BR>This awesome body of work presents itself, in my opinion, as the logical next step after Hybrid Theory and Reanimation. <BR><BR>Overall heavier and darker than Theory, (although not longer in running time) this album is a true gem and expands the Linkin Park universe. It completely rocks from the beginning till the end!<BR><BR>There are no weak moments here, but if I had to name a few personal favorites they would be FIGURE 0.9, LYING FROM YOU, DON'T STAY, EASIER TO RUN, FAINT and SOMEWHERE I BELONG<BR><BR>[LINKIN PARK] METEORA review
B000068PQ0|5.0|I heard a clip of &quot;Do You Realize?&quot; toward the end of some show and had to have it.  I was a little put off at first by much of the CD but I love most of it now.  These guys are definitely not the run of the mill and their lyrics make you think.  I especially like &quot;Do You Realize?&quot;, &quot;Fight Test&quot;, &quot;In the Morning of the Magicians&quot; and &quot;Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell&quot; - many familiar thoughts but often necessary to be reminded.  It's apparently unfashionable for a 54 year old to be a rocker but....
0345440900|4.0|I felt like this book would be partiucarily helpful for a new mom who didn't have many friends around at the same stage.  The information was helpful and loving.  I have several friends with babies older and at the same stage and from our grouping (a very well read one!) this book seemed middle ground to me.  I appreciated that she encourages you to learn your baby's temperment.
B000084T18|4.0|I think that this album does live up to the hype. I feel that 50 Cent is talented. All Hip Hop doesn't have to be the same. If you like Common, The Roots, or Jurassic 5 you may not like this artist. If you're into club music and songs with very well produced music then you'll like 50 Cent. He has catchy lyrics and a nice baritone voice. I like 80% of the album. It was a very good effort.

B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD because I'd heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and loved it - and because Evanescence is from my home town.  Although I'm in my 40's, my musical tastes are pretty eclectic... but I didn't really expect to like every song on this CD. From the moment I put it in my car's CD player, I was hooked.  This band is FANTASTIC.  Every song on the CD is worth listening to - over &amp; over again!
B000089RVX|5.0|&quot;Fallen&quot;, the title of the new album from Evanescence, is very much an inappropriate name.  If anything, it should have been named something along the lines of &quot;On The Way Up&quot;  because that is where this quintet is headed, straight to the tops of the charts.  At times melodic, and other times raw, the overall vibe of this album is something almost euphoric.  The straight forward guitar riffs, combined with the slightly more conservative piano, will almost woo you into a deep sleep.  Instead, they set the stage for the enchanting voice of the Lead Vocalist Amy Lee.  Her voice carries with the presence of 100 screams, but is calming enough to sooth even the most savage of beasts.  Her tones are full, her screams are shattering, giving the impression that she is singing to you and you alone.  All of these qualities, seemingly make her the &quot;Jon Davis&quot; of the female vocalist world.  Songs such as &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; will seem to settle your soul, but instead are merely preparing you for the pounding you'll soon receive from such tracks as &quot;Tourniquet&quot; and the albums finale, &quot;Whisper&quot;.  For those who have not listened to the album yet, let me give you one piece of advice.  Be ready to grip this album tightly, because when you hear it, you'll want to keep it for yourself.
0783226160|5.0|National Lampoon's animal house is the all-time classic college movie.  Other college movies like 'road trip' and 'revenge of the nerds' just don't come close to this comedic masterpiece.<BR>The movie is stolen by John Belushi who plays the beer-guzzling John 'bluto' blutarski, sergent-at-arms of the infamous 'Delta tau chi' fraternity.  The Deltas do several pranks during the movie, including stealing the answers for a test, looting the supermarket, and throwing a roman toga party.  TOGA!! <BR>In one of my favorite scenes in the movie, Bluto stuffs mashed potatoes in his mouth and slaps his cheeks, spewing potatoes all over the rival fraternity chairman.  &quot;I'm a zit. Get it?&quot; he proclaims.  Classic!  And so much of this movie was done spur of the moment, including Bluto smashing a beer can on his forehead, and Daniel Simpson 'd-day' Day playing his throat.  If you haven't seen this movie, go out and rent it.  You won't regret it.
B000000H42|5.0|one of the absolute best Metal albums of all-time. Hank Shermann &amp; Michael Denner are the best guitar duo I've EVER seen live !
B000002USN|5.0| <BR>I could sit and listen to this CD every single day of my life and never tire of it. It is a masterpiece. I pity those who think it any less than spectacular; they may have damaged their aural senses and sensibilities listening to pop drivel which has clouded their minds with ideas of what constitutes good music...<br />The magnitude of emotional outpouring in each and every song is so intense I need brace myself against the onslaught of tears as Frank and company sing about love... its ideals and losing it to someone who doesn't share the capacity to understand what it means to truly love and give yourself to another.<br />I also love singing along, either with Frank or with his many partners. I find it interesting that he sings directly to many of them (e.g., \\"I have got a crush, my Barbra, on you\\"...), yet the detractors would have us believe all duets were sung separately, perhaps even to older Sinatra recordings. There's obviously still much collaborative flare in each song.<br />Get your hands on it. Listen. Sing along. Cry when the mood hits.<BR>Then play it again. Rinse and repeat...<br />A great companion album is The Best of Roberta Flack, and perhaps The Best of Sade to round it out with a younger taste.
0316666343|4.0|One of the best books I have read this year.  A unique tale unlike any other I have read that inspires thoughts about life, death, family, and the things that are truly important to you.  As the book opens and you begin to understand that Susie is telling her story, the story of her death and the lives of those that go on without her, it is easy to become lost in the story.  The first approx. 70 pages were difficult to read, as these are the pages where Susie details her murder.  However, after the first approx. 70 pages, I was so intrigued by the book that I had a hard time putting it down.<br />I have heard many say the book is \\"dark\\", but I found the book to be more though-provoking than anything else.  Most of all, this book made me wonder what \\"my heaven\\" would look like if I were to die today.  What are the things that I love most and find most important that I would have with me?<br />I have loaned by copy of this book to so many friends already, and have recommended it to everyone I know.
0618154043|3.0|\\"Unfinished Tales\\" is a must-have for any Tolkien lover with a desire to know more about Middle-Earth.<br />It is not, despite what some of these reviews say, a novel.  It is a collection of shorter writings, all of them (in case it wasn't obvious) unfinished, in one sense or another, edited with notes and commentary by J. R. R. Tolkien's son Christopher.<br />It stands functionally somewhere between \\"The Silmarillion\\" and the later-published books; the former was presented as a more-or-less complete work (even though Tolkien never really stopped working on it) while the latter are intended more as a study of the evolution of Tolkien's Middle-Earth universe.  \\"Unfinished Tales\\" shows some of this evolution, too, with different and sometimes contradictory versions of many of the stories; but the emphasis is on the stories and not their writing.<br />Much as I enjoyed \\"The Silmarillion\\", I would not describe it as required reading for all Tolkien fans -- it's stylistically very different from \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much less oriented to a popular audience and more difficult for many readers.  The first two parts of \\"Unfinished Tales\\" likewise.  Those who revel in the rich mythology of \\"The Silmarillion\\" will find more to treasure here; those whose Tolkien appreciation doesn't extend to \\"The Silmarillion\\" won't enjoy the first half of \\"Unfinished Tales\\" either.<br />But the latter half of the book will appeal to any LotR fan.  The background on the history of the relationship between Gondor and Rohan; the recounting of Sauron's desperate search for the Ring; Gandalf's recollections of how and why he brought the odd couple of Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins together -- great stuff, and perhaps best of all is the terse and tense recounting of \\"The Disaster of the Gladden Fields\\", when Isuldur lost the Ring and his life, setting in motion the whole War of the Ring centuries later.<br />BUT... all this is marred in the 2001 hardcover edition by, letus not mince words, the rape of the map.  I bought this book expecting the large, pull-out map, updated beyond what's in LotR, that was included in the first edition.  Instead it's reduced to the size of two book pages and printed before the title page!  Not only does the reduction render it near-unreadable, but of course the binding seam goes right down the middle, obliterating names and locations of some of the most significant places in Middle-Earth from Rivendell to Dol Amroth.  Houghton Mifflin ought to be ashamed.  With a proper map I would have given five stars; with this atrocity, I can give only three.

B00006G8O1|5.0|I just watched Donnie Darko last night and I thought it was the most brilliant movie I have ever seen. It reminds me of my favorite TV show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, because it combines so many different genres, such as comedy, drama, satire, science fiction, horror, suspense, all wrapped up into the greatest movie I have ever seen. This movie is a must-see because it is so original and well done. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who is not into the ordinary, boring, and moronic movies that are usually out. I absolutely loved this movie and hope others will buy it and feel the same way that I do about it!!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This group is just on a tear!!!  I am the #1 fan of this group and all i gotta say is nothing can compare to this group.  I picked up this cd right when it came out and i haven't stopped listening to it.  That's what i did with hybrid theory and reanimation.  i would give the rundown on every song, but there is no point.  they all get 5 stars!!!  I could put all their cd's into my cd player, hit the random button, and wouldn't care which song came on, because i like them all the same.  <br />But if i had to choose just one song off this new album that i prefer over the rest...it would have to be #9 (Breaking the Habit).  Let me just say i believe Chester is the best.  I can listen to this song over and over again and never get bored of it!!!  I use to think he was really good in My December, but this one he did way better in.<br />I just hope i don't have to wait another 3 years for the next album to come out.  They can take there time, b/c i'll be listening to this for a long long time...and i know that the next album is just going to be as good...if not better!!!!  can't you wait!!?<br />I don't know, but i had a crazy idea.  What if eminem did something with these guys.  I don't know i just think it would be off the hook.  I don't know though, it's just that this group doesn't cuss in there songs, and eminem would just have to keep up his reputation of using his language he does.  Don't get me wrong though, i have much love for him.  WOULDN'T THAT BE COOL IF THEY GOT TOGETHER AND DID SOMETHING THOUGH!!!!?<br />Keep rocking LP and i can't wait to see you guys live @ Seahawk's Stadium in Seattle on August 7.

B000008CX0|5.0|This album by Annihilator is an absolute masterpiece.  It is definitely the best album of 1990, possibly the best, period.  I don't think that there is a metal album that can compare to this album.  Everything about Never Neverland is awesome.  Coburn Pharr is absolutely fantastic and Jeff Waters shows why he is such a great musician.  Jeff's rhthym guitar is terrific and there is not ONE bad song on this album.  This album also features absolutely fast songs such as Phantasmagoria as well as slower melodic songs like Stonewall and the title track.  This album does not have any ballads but who cares?  This is a great album by a great band who to this day continues writing fast heavy metal after Megadeth and Metallica became more commercial.  This album is better than any Pantera, Megadeth or Slayer album in my opinion.  This record is just 10 times better than a few other famous albums of 1990 such as Cowboys From Hell or Rust In Peace.<br />Even though Jeff had a drinking problem, he wrote and still writes great music while Dave Mustaine who became greedy is now out of the music business and he really has lost his ability to write good meaningfull songs.  This album is worth it for every heavy metal fan and anyone who is looking for a heavy metal cd with no flaws MUST buy this album.
B000089RVX|5.0|A well-blended mix of skillfully done metal-edged rock, two-ton riffs lightened and complemented by Lee's evocative, sorrowful voice.  Her range is pretty fair, but she doesn't seem to explore it as much as she should.  For those frightened off by goth-rock, never fear.  This album never degenerates into the slow, introspective navel-gazing graveyard dirges that seem to trap so many \\"goth\\" bands lately.  The great majority of the tracks feature the catchy hooks and riffs that most other bands miserly dole out two per album. \\"Fallen\\" evokes a comparison Skindive's debut album, but is a bit harder.  This an album that will kick your butt thoroughly, and make you weep while it's doing it.  I wish records like this came along once a month instead of once a year: Evanescence gives 100% and holds nothing back.
B000088E6D|5.0|love the voice. love the style, love the phrasing.  love everything about this c.d. keep the music coming because you have captured our hearts.  we are fans forever, where have you been all this time...  best voice to be heard in a very long time.  you are by far the real thing, and you deserve all our praise!!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Parks new album comes as a refreshing change to the dissapointing Reanimation. This album takes the standard nu-metal formula of rapping, decks and loud guitars but flips it on it's head and adds the brutal raw energy and emotion of frontman Chester Bennington. While this album differs from Hybrid Theory greatly it is still an amazing album and in my opinion is better.Songs such as Lying From You,Numb and Somewhwere I belong are a heavier alternative to songs such as Crawling from Hybrid.   A great album,  Buy it now!!
B000088E6D|4.0|I have brought this record for only 1 day. I cannot stop listening to it. The album contains elements of rock, soul, and jazz flavor of interpretation of those &quot;odies but goodies&quot;.Every song remind you of some sort ERRA that you have gone thru. The singer, Michael Buble, has great control on phrasing. His interpretation of the &quot;How can we ment a broken heart&quot; fits the range of his voice. Who needs to look for a search of American Idol. He is definitely out last those 12 contestants finalist. Congratulation to him for a getting this record break deals.<BR> Pesonally, I like the most of the ballad song that he sang on the album. I cannot wait til his next album. Keep on singing those ballad song.
0060922583|5.0|This is my faverite non-fiction book of all time.As this book illustrates,sometimes truth IS stranger than fiction.It even gives a convincing chain of logic supporting idealism by talking about the special features of hypnosis. This reasoning is given on the chapter, &quot;A Pocketful of Miracles.&quot; I also liked reading about the many wierd and wonderful miracles that SEEM to violate the laws of nature.What's really interesting is that most of them were authenticated by upstanding men of science.This book might change your view of &quot;reality.&quot;
B00004ZD69|5.0|Here's one I know will be with me forever.  It's had and will continue to have a profound impact on me.  Music for every part of a person.  Music to nourish your soul.  Music for any time of day or night. LYSFLATH is Music to listen to with an open mind and a seeking heart pounding and throbbing with a deep thirst for answers to your abyssmal questions.  If you approach the Music like this, it will not only answer your questions but lead you into a perpetual rebirth of questions and answers. Sometimes though, it's just nice to have something that has the power to transport you for awhile. Yes? Yeah. \m/ And she smiles...  Four songs, two cds and 87:23 running time, yet with every listen, Time Dissipates and I am in a world of peace, light and beauty--this world.  Coney Island revisited perhaps? So I say, sleep on the beach if you want--I am! If you don't understand, you will after you listen.  The upper echelon of stars--five doesn't come close...this Music is Infinite. One thing is for sure, LYSFLATH will speak to you.  What it says is up to you. It is my hope that it lifts you up to...<br />Soar!
0671449028|5.0|The thing I like most about this book is how much fun it is to read.  I started reading to my daughter even before she was born and the rhyming is really what got her attention at first.  This is the type of book that your kids will bring to you and beg you to read it.  The bonus is that unlike some children's books, you don't mind reading it for the hundreth time!
B00003CXXS|5.0|Okay, well, I loved the original movie but hey, how can ANYONE actually like that horrible, boring sequel Lost World?  ... When I saw this coming I thought oh no.  But guess what?  It's 100 times better than Lost World.  So is it really a 5 star movie?  Maybe not, but I'm gonna give it that JUST because it is SOOOOOOO much better than that lousy sequel Lost World.<br />This one makes up in spades for the problems with Lost World and I was very pleasantly surprised.  The story is not all over the map here, it's not that long so it's not obviously padded out in long boring go nowhere scenes like in Lost World.  And the story and characters are all much more believable here.  This cannot compare to the original film, but THIS should've been the sequel, not that awful Lost World.  This one has cool dinosaurs all over the place not a bunch of boring talking scenes over and over like Lost World.  The music and direction is just as good as the first one also.  And Tea Leone is a dish to look at.<br />This is a perfect rainy Saturday afternoon popcorn muncher and because it is short, it's much better packed with essentials and the story and pace is so much better than ... Lost World.  ... I would never buy any trilogy set for this because that means it would include the second film Lost World, ... Jurassic Park III has been on cable constantly for months and it's always fun to put on and watch bits and pieces.  <br />Okay, so it's not nearly as good as the original, and it is by no means any sort of landmark or great film, but comparitively speaking, and that's where this review is coming from, COMPARED TO THE LOST WORLD, this movie absolutely RULES!  If/when they ever do a fourth Jurassic movie, I can only hope it is nothing like the Lost World.  ...  This third one I'll watch over and again just like the first because they are both fun and entertaining.  ... This third one is involving and entertaining from start to finish as long as you don't expect something as good asthe first movie.<br />...  This one is much closer to the spirit of the original movie, much much much more than that first and totally forgettable sequel Lost World.  Ugh!  This third one is short and sweet and fun.  Kudos to all for getting it right again unlike that horrible Lost World.  Did I say ugh?  UGH!  Buy the first and this...
B00005JLF5|5.0|It was great going back and seeing how the series started off.  I haven't been able to find DS9 in syndication in my area so I haven't seen the first season in years.  Looking at the dvds, you can see how some things carry over to season 7, it's a great story arc.  Beware of the Kira &quot;extra&quot; on the last disc if you haven't seen the whole series, as it has some spoiler moments.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I just saw this movie last night and I can't stop thinking about it!  This is not a movie just for kids or for anime fans, it's for everybody.  The story is wonderful and engaging and the animation is spectacular.  I don't know why this wasn't nominated for Best Picture, in my opinion it deserves the distinction.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is by far Nirvana's greatest album.  From the beginning to the end, Kurt's genious can be heard and felt through the entire CD.  This is one of the few albums with no bad songs on it.  It contains some of Nirvana's biggest hits as well as some of their best less-known songs as well.  Grunge music is shaped after this CD.  The quality of Kurt's songwriting beats any musician writing today, and this is the highlight of rock music.  After hearing this album, I had to continue to listen to different Nirvana CDs because this CD shows their talent and genious.  If you are a rock fan, you must have this CD.
B00007G25J|5.0|For me, there is no movie in existence that compares with   Giuseppe Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso. It is beyond cinema; it is nothing less than  pure art  -- painting, music and poetry --in its most sweepingly beauteous form,  the soul of which is weakened in attempt to convey  here through words.  Others before me have reviewed this work of genius, and from them you can take the plot, but if you want to know what this movie is really about, you must see it and only then will you be captivated and beguiled.  <br />I lived with the older, shorter version for over ten years and had no idea I would be even so much more moved with the longer, more recent, uncut version.
B00008H2LB|5.0|For all of you who think Linkin Park commercialized themselves with Reanimation, you're dead wrong. Linkin Park makes another great album as the true followup to their just plain awesome Hybrid Theory.<br />1. Foreword: 5/5<BR>Well, it's only an intro, but it leads into the forst song Don't Stay fabulously well.<br />2. Don't Stay: 4/5<BR>A great LP song in their classic style but personally its not my favorite.<br />3. Somewhere I Belong: 5/5<BR>An almost blatent In the End clone, though still a great rap-rc song. SIB is almost the definition of what rap-rock is.<br />4. Lying From You: 4/5<BR>A nice song. Nto my personal favorite but still great.It's basically SIB but a little more emotional.<br />5. Hit the Floor: 5/5 (I'd really give it a 6/5)<BR>My personal favorite song on the whole CD. Extremely loud at parts, maybe a little too loud for the MTV teey-boppers, but still a fabulous rock song with the traditional LLP twist.<br />6. Easier to Run: 5/5<BR>A softer break from Hit the Floor. A great track in which Chester [LP's main singer] get fairly emotional.<br />7. Faint: 4/5<BR>Personally, I don't really like Faint, though the verses in which Mike [LP's emcee] spits out some incredibly fast and high quality rhymes.<br />8. Figure.09: 5/5<BR>My second favorite song on the album. Like Hit the Floor and almost as good. It's a traditional LP style song.<br />9. Breaking teh Habit: 5/5<BR>If I had reviewed this album the day I got it, this song [BTH] would have gotten a 3/5. It's nothing like anything else on the album. BTH isn't very loud at all. Though it a very complex song that really grows on you. I really like, though it's not the standard LP style.<br />10. From the Inside: 5/5<BR>Another great song from LP. Really what I thought BTH would be like, though both it and BTH are fabulous.<br />11. Nobody's Listening: 5/5<BR>A nice LP style track with Japanese style flutes in the backrouns that give it a creepy feeling.<br />12. Session: 4/5<BR>Not as good as Cure for the Itch or its remix but still great.<br />13. Numb: 5/5<BR>A very emotional LP style sond that parallels a lto to Puching Me Away from Hybrid Theory.<br />Overall, METOERA is a great album. A definite classic. One amazong thing is how each song sounds great individually, but togather they seem like one perfect story that has 12 chapters. For any rock fan, this is a must have! Stop reading this and go buy a copy!
B00008H2LE|5.0|having been disappointed with Reanimation (an unnecessary remix album), i was feeling a little skeptic about Meteora on how it would sound. until after hearing the first single Somewhere I belong, i was almost certain that Meteora would be like Hybrid Theory...packed with great songs. and i was not disappointed at all...this album is totally worth the wait (even for a 36 minute album). here is my breakdown of the songs:<br />01 Foreword - just an intro to the next song..sounds cool though<BR>02 Don't Stay (5/5) - i like the heavy sound of it, kind of like <BR>                      heavier One Step Close but more nicer.<BR>03 Somewhere I Belong (5/5) - great first single, the intro is <BR>                              really nice! i like it a lot.<BR>04 Lying Form You (4/5) - really good feel to it, the tune is <BR>                          unique and vocals are great.<BR>05 Hit The Floor (3/5) - i really dont feel this song, but not <BR>                         that bad either.<BR>06 Easier To Run (5/5) - this is one of my favorite tracks on   <BR>                         the cd, great chorus and great melody!<BR>07 Faint (4/5) - the papercut on this cd for me, mike did a     <BR>                 great job in rapping and chester on the chorus.<BR>08 Figure.09 (4/5) - above average track..it has the usual <BR>                     linkin park vibe in the song.<BR>09 Breaking The Habit (5/5) - wow, great song! not like the  <BR>                     usual LP sound since it has an orchestra. <BR>                     chester's vocals is really good on this one.<BR>10 From The Inside (5/5) - another great song..i love the  <BR>                           singing style of chester here.<BR>11 Nobody's Listening (4/5) - great but could've done better   <BR>                       with the chorus, more guitars maybe.. <BR>                       but nonetheless its a great track.<BR>12 Session (3/5) - another instrumental track, cure for the itch <BR>                   is better...<BR>13 Numb (10/5!!) - this one blows me away, this is the best     <BR>          track on this cd no doubt! the verses and chorus are <BR>          well polished! its hard to believe they've done this <BR>          almost effortlessly (as the notes on the booklet says).
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I have to say that I am a fan of different music, especially artists from other countries who do not get the respect they deserve on American airwaves.  If you hop into my car, you can hear anything from bands like Fury In the Slaughterhouse, Morphine and The Judybats to R. Kelly and Missy Elliott and back to Tim Rushlow and Mark Wills (believe me that is quite a range).  So when the first time I heard \\"All The Things She Said\\" on the radio, my first response was...\\"hey, what, whoa, who is this new band? Sounds like a cross between Prodigy and Enya!\\" After doing some research and accquiring the album, I can say my first impression of the band is about right. Most people would think that the mix between the two would be something that would clah horribly.  However, this duo makes it work...for that they get a passing grade.  However, this album is actually far superior to a passing grade earning them four stars in my book.  The only reason they would not get a five is that no one is perfect, but this is a great started album for the band.  Some may get tired of the covert lesbian themes in the song, however, I think that probably any misunderstood teen or adult could identify with the lyrics.<br />Going thru the list of songs, here is how the rank with one being the worse and ten being the best.<br />1. Not Going To Get Us - Dance track written all over it. This song has heavy beats and you will find your head bobbing to the beat.  If you like Prodigy, this song reminds me a lot of their work. I played this song to death and I am sure my husband is ready to kill me from hearing it over and over.  This song, in my opinion makes you feel like you are invincible!  A definate pick me up.  (9)<br />2.  All The Things She Said -- Song with the most radio play.  When I first heard the song, I thought it was pretty cool.  I still think this song is a good song, however, it has been replaced by other songs on the album which I believe are better. (7)<br />3.  Show Me Love --This is the best song on the album in my opinion.  Not as fast as Track One, but I can see this song become a club favorite (as the remix/extended version).  This is another one of those songs that I have played to death.  The orginal version of Show Me Love, although a techno song is one that you will find yourself singing under your breath unaware one day at work \\"like a game a pick up sticks, played by f---ing lunatics\\" when things at work are just not going well!(10)<br />4.  30 Minutes -- Here, we are more on the side of Enya.  I was a little taken aback by this track, however, it is a beautiful track and it deals with tough decisions.  Very simple and clean and you can really hear the beauty of the girl's vocals on this track. Although not a dance track, I think if you are in a mellow mood you would like this song(7)<br />5.  How Soon Is Now?  -- I approached this track with caution at first because I have heard so many remakes of this song by The Smith's from artists such as Morrisey and Love Spit Love.  This is the ultimate gloom and doom song dealing with love and relationships, and I have a tendency to be a little bit harder on covers...in my opinion covers usually destroy the beauty of the orginal.  However, this is not the case here!  Tatu makes this song almost seem...should I dare say, happy?  You can bob your head to this song and do a little dance as well!  Good Job! (9)<br />6. Clowns -- Another Dance track.  This track reminds me a little more of Basement Jaxx than Prodigy...or more like a cross between the two and a little bit of Moby.  If I had to burn this track on a personal cd, I would probably stick this song next to Basement Jaxx's \\"Rendez - Vu\\"...it is not as heavy on the beats as Basement Jaxx, however, I give the reference do to the fact a guitar is used very heavly on \\"Rendez - Vu\\".  Here the girls sing pretty fast, but it goes with the pace of the song.  A good song, not a favorite, but a song that would get your butt out of the chair and moving! (8)<br />7. Malchik Gay -- Daring song...these girls love controversy don't they? Wanting a gay guy? Wow. (But I am sure that a couple of us \\"straight\\" women have wanted a guy of the opposite taste a time or two!) I don't really see this a song that would be played in a club, but it does have some dance appeal.  More of an enya song, this song sounds probably as close as Top 40 as you can get, but I doubt with the lyrics of the song it would get there. This song is pretty average, nice, but not the best one on the album (5)<br />8. Stars -- Another Enya song in the vein of \\"30 Minutes\\".  It repeats the some lyrics, not much of a song.  Much of it is in Russian in a scratchy dj sound, which takes away from the song.  The song does demonstrate the power of the girl's voices, though. Good to listen to if you are in a mellow mood, however it is probably the weakest song on the CD (3)<br />9 and 10 -- Untranslated versions the two first songs see above ratings.<br />11 Show Me Love -- extended version, see above.<br />I all I think the CD shows promise and that it is definately worth a listen.  A good Dance Album. Hope this helps!
B000068TPN|5.0|Aside from the mid-60s 'hoakeyness' and the 'over-the-top' religious connotations, this is a really is a great movie about Viet Nam. Although there is no possible way to portray what actually happened in Viet Nam in a film (yet many have tried to do so), of all the movies that have been made about Nam - this is the closet rendering of a real Viet Nam fire-fight that I have ever seen, and it actually attempts to address both sides of the fight.  A great story and a true reminder of the horror that American Soldiers have gone through to protect the basic freedoms that we all enjoy on a daily basis...
0783223218|2.0|Give the filmmakers credit for a couple of things, at least.  The story moves along well and is filmed very well.  There are a few moments that actually have a bit of tension, the music score works quite well, and occasionally everything gels into a good scene.<br />But let me get this straight.  The FBI is on the hunt for an assassin so elusive only one woman in the world can ID him, she's disappeared years ago and is equally elusive, yet an Irish gun-runner in a US prison is the key to both so the FBI gets him out and basically lets him run the operation?<br />All the cliches are here, too.  The \\"Here's the key to a locker in a bus/train station where you'll find (whatever),\\" the \\"invincible villain purposely leaving an obscure clue that is unconvincingly figured out just in the nick of time to foil his evil plot,\\" the \\"master of disguise,\\" the \\"stupid greedy minor character who tries to rip off the villain only to die in a horrible way,\\" etc. etc. etc.<br />Poor Sidney Poitier.  One of this nation's great actors is wasted in a role that could basically be played equally well by any one with a SAG card.  Poor Tess Harper.  The underrated actress gets high billing here, but only shows up for the last half-hour, and she plays a thinly-veiled Hillary Clinton, complete with horrible hairdo and abdominable wardrobe.  Worse, her two scenes (only two?!) consist of a brief interview with Larry King and a public speech that plays in the background.<br />And Bruce Willis as the Jackal himself is as woefully miscast as the cold-blooded killer for hire.  Trying to break out of type, Addison?  It ain't workin'.  In every single scene I expected him to break into a smirking wisecrack a la \\"Moonlighting\\" or \\"Die Hard,\\" etc., being only momentarily able to sustain the truly psycho attitude.<br />Oddly, the one actor who fares best here is Richard Gere.  I'll buy his Irish accent, and he plays his character well here, although, again, it makes one roll with laughter to see him time and again take leadership in planning sessions both with the director and deputy director of the FBI.  Said big shots basically sit by and say \\"Yeah, that's a good plan, let's do it.\\"  And I do wish Gere would learn to open his mouth and speak up rather than mush his lines.  He's no Brando.<br />So, to sum up:  Stupid plot, badly miscast actors, and oh yes, one of the most left-field nonsensical endings you'll ever see...
0767819446|3.0|It fell apart at the end, it's pre-matrix world vision never fully realized and then trivialized to a love story.  But the special efefcts and the attempt are noteworthy.
B000077VT7|4.0|Here's the film &quot;Mission Impossible 2&quot; wishes it could have been.  It's the story of a near-corpse who is rescued floating in the ocean and can remember everything but who he is, what he does with his life, and how he got there.<br />Yeah, the amnesia angle certainly has a bad rep, but the stylish film keeps the action rolling and makes it work.  Unlike MI2, there's no rock-video posing, no plot holes the size of Hummers, and no escapes from sticky situations that would make 007 blush.  It all fits.<br />And ultimately the mystery is solved for us all, of course, in a legit fashion that shows this action spy flick to have a surprisingly good heart.  The endings (both of them) seemed a bit too cutesy for me, and in two or three places the pacing of the film seems like the editing was done with the theory &quot;Let's cut to some action so they can't think about what a stretch that bit of business was,&quot; but all in all this is certainly one of the better films of its genre in recent memory.
0780622545|5.0|I rarely give anything 5 stars, reserving taht for the truly spectacular, the things I would give as gifts or put on a top ten list.  This movie is one of them.  The intracacies of plot and character, is stupendous and theset designs are amazing.<BR>What I will say truly setthsi film apart from toher sci-fi films is the fully relaized plotting of so many characters coming from such varied frames of reference.  William Hurt does an amazing job as someone who doesn't believe and then comes to both believe and understand.  What and who everyone is, and ultimately where they even are is a truly magnificent tale.  From first frame to last, this film shows a maturaity in teh expression of psychic abilities and ultimately in relaity tampering.
B000066C6Z|5.0|This movie never gets old. It's so damn funny it'll take forever to explain. If you love slapstick, sight gags, bad puns, and overall stupidity, then this movie is for you.<br />Val Kilmer lacks experience here, but he pulls off his starring role as he hams up silly 50's rock n roll style songs(Skeet-surfin USA is a particular favorite). And who could ever forget the best part about being in the back of a two man cow costume??<br />The funniest gag of all is to see so many Frenchmen putting up a fight!!!
B00005JLF5|5.0|I love DS9, I cannot lie.  All the others, I must deny.  Voyager----uuuummmmmmmm \\"What character growth\\"?, TNG----didn't get to launch full steam into an 8th season to really pull together---made movies too fast and well, we've seen the results.<BR>But DS9 was complex from the get go, the play on teh Nazi Occupation, the heavy religious overtones.  The static situation of a starbase vs. a ship.  Captain Sisko being someone who was destined to be there.  The crew alone coudl trash any other crew out there.  WHat made them so great was that they didn't particularly all like each other when teh show began, there was friction.  Friction that was explored and deepened as time went on.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Every band has a chance to grow and mature in their music. Even Pink started out as a sell out but then her second record was a chance to be her true self. I was hoping Linkin Park would use this record and their popularity to explore more territory with their music. They spear headed the rap-metal revolution and lived off of the success of Hybrid Theory for an unbelievable Two Years. Well two years and one remix album later it's hard to believe that LP is in it for the art of music when all they seem to churn out are &quot;play it safe&quot; 3 minute pop hits. Nothing is more fulfilling then a 50 + rock record that uses every track to explore the bands full musical progression. Linkin Park doesn't do this at all. Their are some band that can get away with 30 minute CD's such as Weezer, but LP is no weezer. These songs are very melodic and will sell to the media very easily. It may save LP in the short term but in their is no long term shelf life for their CD's (at least not on my shelf) And in Rock the long term is what matters, and it appears LP may not have much of a future once their trendiness is over. If you trully believe LP to be the &quot;best band out their&quot; then you need to dig deeper. Check out A perfect Circle, Chevelle, Appleseed Cast, or The Juliana Theory for some great music.
6304039506|5.0|The writing makes this truly stand out, make sthis a marvel to behld.  Teh actors are completely immersed in their roles, vanishing into not wholely likeable characters.  In a time when people are worried about thei rpublic image, its nice to have this as a reference to when actors didn't care about what you thought of them as people because they separated their identities from their roles.  Now, it's a star with a movie around them.  But at this point and time, it was all about the craft of doing something that would shock and amaze and be critically examined.
6305075492|3.0|I first watched &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; in a film class in college. Watching it confused as well as interested me. Visually, the film is incredible. I have to give respect since it is such an important film in history. Although I did not like the overall story, &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; is a film that everyone should watch at least once, whether you're a film buff or not. It really opens your eyes to differnt techniques and a different style of filmmaking.

B00004U8P9|5.0|&quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; is a movie I can never grow tired of. This film is full of craziness and fun - one that never ceases to amaze me. I watch this film every Halloween when it's on television and find myself singing along and imagining myself as some of the characters. Unfortunately I have been unable to experience this film in a theater with other fellow Rocky Horror fans, but what I've seen of the viewings on tv, they are truly something to behold.<br />I would highly suggest this film to anyone who would like a good laugh and some great fun! You won't be disappointed!
B00006JKON|1.0|Once upon a time Jethro Tull had an enormous popular following--really. This is the record that reduced that following to a small cult, and small cult it has remained. The small cult is fiercely loyal, to be sure--Jethro Tull could release a record full of belching and the small cult would fill this site with five-star reviews.<br />In any case, &quot;Sea Lion&quot;, &quot;The Third Hurrah&quot;, and &quot;Two Fingers&quot; are absolute garbage. &quot;Queen and Country&quot; is boring and trite. &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot; is just annoying. These five songs make half the record, and I deduct one star for each. <br />(By the bye, speaking of &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot;, everyone who ever graduated high school knows it is NOT true that &quot;He who made kittens put snakes in the grass&quot;. God, figuratively speaking, put snakes in the grass; God didn't make kittens. Tiny tame domestic cats were bred by MAN from large feral cats....which reminds me in turn of this Ian Anderson line from &quot;Stand Up&quot;: &quot;Roll us both down a mountain and I'm sure the fat man would win&quot;. Everyone who ever graduated high school also knows that Galileo proved centuries ago the fat man would NOT win; falling objects accelerate at the same rate regardless of mass.)<br />Continuing: The title song's refrain has potential, but its verse is also deadly boring. &quot;Back Door Angels&quot; would be fine if not for its tedious instrumental sections with their pointless key changes, with Martin Barre's dull and uninspired solos, with John Evan's obnoxious organ, and with tedious stopping and starting (an interesting idea, but it doesn't work). &quot;Skating Away&quot; is strong, easily the best song on the record, but its arrangement is cluttered, and its lyrics are puerile in places. I agree with the reviewer below that the ending of &quot;Ladies&quot; ruins it; I do not agree that it is otherwise &quot;beautiful&quot;--it is otherwise nice, and that is all. (That ending, by the bye, is NOT at all reminiscent of &quot;jazz&quot;--it's more like a polka or something of that sort--and neither does it have anything to do with &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;.) The first half of &quot;Only Solitaire&quot; (about thirty seconds) is also nice.
B00008DZ81|5.0|For all the family and of course all the fans of Harry Potter.<BR>As in the first movie, the director shows us the same visions that we experienced reading the book.<BR>Brillant script and extraordinary special effects are the main atracctions. The Quidditch scene is more frenetic than in the first movie.<BR>Two thumbs up to this beautiful movie.<BR>enjoyyyy
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you want GREAT reviews that really describe what makes this series wonderful, others have written them on Amazon.<br />What I will tell you is this:  Band of Brothers is one of the most inspirational and accurate series ever produced.  The re-creation of the battle sequences is unbelievable.  The feeling you get from the men - what the World War II experience did to and for these men reveals much about the human experience and what it is to be an American.<br />A word of warning - if you watch this series once, you will watch it again and again; so you better have some time on your hands.
0783117523|4.0|This tale of the fashion industry, and how it uses, abuses, and discards its participants, features strong performances. First, Angelina Jolie, as the brassy, sassy, and ultimately pitiful figure of Gia, as well as Mercedes Ruehl, as her mother, and others, make this a tragic tale of a girl, who makes it big; then self-destructs, facing what was then the largely unknown disease which was, and still is, Aids.  Not for everyone but a good movie.  There is an unrated version; which I'm not sure what more could be added, as this \\"R\\" rated one features quite a bit of controversial material (Nudity, Lesbianism, Drug Use). Not a upbeat movie but a moral fable for modern times.
079070546X|3.0|In my opinion, `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' is in fact the best of the four Vacation movies.  The slapstick usage is hilarious; and a certain step up from the original and 'NL's European Vacation'.  The Griswolds are a fun-loving, ill-fated bunch that deliver the laughs like no other [movie] family out there.  This is certainly one that the whole family can enjoy; year after year after year for that matter.  `Christmas Vacation' is no doubt a timeless classic.  And in the third of four Vacation flicks, they deliver with greater triumph.  Even so, I did find a few weak things within the film's success.<br />This is one of the funniest, and best, Christmas comedy movies available; though (in my opinion) not one of Chevy Chase's best performances.  I think he is so much better in both `Fletch' and `Fletch Lives'.  As he does in all the vacation movies, Chase (as Clark Griswold) seems to not be phased at all by the endless bad things that happen to him and his family.  It's hard to believe they wouldn't give up; but I guess that's what makes them the Griswolds in the first place.  Anyway, Chevy Chase is not a \\"humbug\\" kind-of guy.  On another low point, the family doesn't really go on a true \\"vacation\\".  I have a hard time understanding how National Lampoon can call this a Vacation movie if they never actually leave town.  Maybe they wanted to give us a look into the home lives of the Griswolds; or something to that effect.  It seemed to work, yet it's not quite what you'll be used to.  Also, the character of Audrey Griswold was replaced (formerly Dana Hill) with Juliette Lewis.  The same goes for the role of Russell.  Jason Lively was replaced by child star Johnny Galecki.  Neither of the replacements are half as good as the originals; the director must`ve been looking for more of a fan-base.  On a more optimistic note, the appearances by infamous funnyman Randy Quaid and Seinfeid co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus are very pleasant.  Maybe not Quaid's character so much; his irritable, unemployed character is rather, well... quaint.  But, as Clark's angered neighbors, Julia and Nicolas Guest offer some comical relief from the Griswold's continual faults.  The troubles Clark and co. have seem to turn on their neighbors.  That worked well for the movie, I think.<br />As I've mentioned, I think this is the best Vacation film.  But that is a very arguable statement.  There are a lot of differences; some good, some bad, that make this one rather special.  However, a fact is that whether at Christmas time or not, you'll enjoy it.  There's parts that we can easily relate to (example: competing with neighbors to see who has the most/best Xmas lights), whereas there's things we couldn't even imagine (example: putting a 25-foot tree in the house).  Whatever the relevance between you and the movie; it makes no difference in the end.  I gave this only 3 stars because I am not a huge fan of the Vacation films; and I don't feel they (this one) showcase the spot-on talents of Chevy Chase as good as the `Fletch' movies do.  Still, enjoy `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' over and over again.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on one of the best Christmas movies around; and the best of the Vacation series.much; his irritable, unemployed character is rather, well... quaint.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Buy it and listen to it over and over. Each time it gets better, and when your think your all &quot;Interpoled out&quot;, try going a month without listening to it.
B000084T18|5.0|hands down, this album is one of the best hip-hop records out in an era where hip-hop needs someone to save it. a lot of hip-hop today focuses on girls (which is not a bad thing by far), money, and cars. 50 brings it back to the old school, when most artists wrote creative rhymes rather than bragging about money and things they have. most of his songs are hardcore, unlike a lot of commercial rappers out today. take jay-z, he says that &quot;50 Cent may be hot, but i'm a buck.&quot; don't get me wrong, jay-z is one of my faves, but his flows have gone from creative and hardcore when he came out to commercialized songs about his label, his money, and his cars. majority of his songs all sound the same now. 50 cent easily blows jay out of the water. <BR>my favorite songs from &quot;Get Rich&quot; have to be &quot;patiently waiting,&quot; &quot;many men,&quot; &quot;high all the time,&quot; &quot;heat,&quot; &quot;back down,&quot; &quot;like my style,&quot; and &quot;don't push me,&quot; because these songs bring back the esscence of hip-hop, when a lot of it was not overrun with commercial rappers like there are today. what people don't realize is that 50 has been doing this for a long time, and this album is just the most recent accomplishment of his already tremendous rap career. the only downside i would have to say about this album is that 50 lacks a strong vocabulary like that of old school rappers, but its made up for with the incredible beats conceived by dre and em. no doubt being associated with em and dre helps 50 out, but he would still make it if they weren't. so the bottom line is, 50 is here to stay, go out and pickup this album, cause there is no other one like it right now.
B00008DZ80|5.0|I saw this movie at our theater. And let me say It was brilliant! My friends and I are still talking about it and we saw it almost 1 month ago. I am 14, and I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan, and I would do anything to see this movie again!
0312305060|4.0|In The Hours, Michael Cunningham accomplishes a great feat by interweaving the true story of an author, Virginia Woolf, her book, and the people it influences.  Mrs. Dalloway (as yet unread by me) depicts a day in the life of one woman.  This book echoes that formula by showing one day in the lives of three different women living at three different times.  Perhaps ironically, the book is written in the present tense.  Cunningham's prose is wonderful and the book is a very addicting read.<br />And yet...<br />There is a great deal of negativity in the novel.  These are the most judgmental characters in literature.  They are impossible to like because they have unkind thoughts for everyone and everything they encounter.  Cunningham is almost Seinfeld-like, the way he agonizes over the minutia of daily life.  A character is condemned because he wears a baseball cap past the age of forty - who is he trying to kid?  I kissed him on the cheek and not the lip - what kind of impression did I give?  Is it immoral to buy flowers - were people exploited in picking them?  <br />However, unlike Seinfeld, none of these characters have a trace of humor.  I can't help but wonder, at times, if these characters are not insightful but merely neurotic?  They are ready to rebuke their fellow human beings for peccadilloes so trivial that a healthy person wouldn't even care.  Virginia Woolf can't even smile at her husband's assistants because she's traumatized by the thought that she will seem to be taking sides.  These character's can't even say \\"I love you\\" because it is a literary cliché.  In reality, these people are probably incapable of love.<br />No wonder the pall of suicide hangs over so many characters.  They cannot understand, even for a moment, that their cynical, post-modern observations may be...wrong.  <br />I don't care what they say, I won't live in a world without humor.
B000089RVX|5.0|This production of heavy, sensuous, bass infested tracks is like nothing I have experienced. The combination of the hard rock-like creation with the thick, rich vocals is unreal. If anyone knows of any other musician/band to compare this album with - i'd like to know. Definitely worth trying out if you like loud, deep rock with a female's vocal blessing.
B00005JLK1|3.0|So, we have Ghost Ship.  Cheesy title.  Typical Trailer.  Released during Halloween.  It feels like a movie you would take your 15 year old girlfriend to see (if you're that age).  So you figure its going to be relatively stupid.  Perhaps like scream, or Child's Play.  <br />I'm not saying this movie is perfect--But this is not your usual experience with horror. So, before I tell you why, here are a few things that brought Ghost Ship down.<br />Number one: Gore is good, but you have to do it the right way.  The beginning scene in Ghost Ship, for the most part, does what I would call a \\"tasteful\\" presentation of this tactic, but there are about 3 or 4 camera shots that do not belong.  After the \\"disaster\\" we get the point.  I don't need to see what looks like a rubber doll, in the center of the screen, flop about and fall over.  It just takes away from the believabilty.  Give me gore, but not too much.  As they say, too much of anything, even blood and guts, can be bad. Show me dripping blood, side angles, far away angles--but don't get close up and stay there forever. Ah, Just watch. You'll see my point. <br />So Next: While the beginning and the end of this movie seem to be strongly connected, the middle gets muddy.  Aside from a few scenes (such as when our heroine goes in the pool) you just sort of sit back and think:  Now what are they doing? Do they have a plan? Or are they just aimlessly looking for spooky things in here? Its like a meal. Good beginning, awesome ending, but the middle just needs more seasoning. <br />Those are my two MAJOR gripes.  But here's the good stuff: The opening credits are even worth noticing here. The movie opens up to a classly longue song, with pink lettering. It's almost as if you're watching the \\"loveboat\\" movie for the first minute and a half. Then everything changes--a quick incident occurs--and everybody dies.  Well, almost everybody.  The camera work is done well here, too (aside from my earlier complaints).<br />Here's a compliment that is rare of Horror Movies:  This one, my friends, has good acting.  Yes, thats right. Good Acting. I think we owe the screen writers a bit of credit on this note, though. Each character has his/her own qualities, weaknesses, and so forth.  You know who is gonna get it, and why.  Its not like watching 10 stupid teenagers chase after a guy in a white mask. The Villian, when introduced, is truly an amazing character.  Ah, just watch. You'll see what I mean. <br />Don't forget about this set.  Its detailed.  Its dark, and full of lovely little nooks and crannies.  It shoots into the past, then to the present, and simply, it looks real. I believed that this boat existed.  <br />What about the Horror? Well, aside from the gore, much it is very subtle.  For example, a woman will see a glimpse of a little girl, a crew member will talk to a dead captain as if nothing is wrong.  Reflections in mirrors come back differenly.  Children's puzzles turn by themselves.  Characters find cigarettes in ashtrays, still burning.  Ghosts sit and smoke on tables--in the sight of the audience, but not the character.  Dead, vacant rooms turn into live, active parties.  Its sort of like \\"The Shining\\" in many respects.  <br />The best part about this one, though, is the way it ends.  I won't give it away, but its a bit more than a simple twist.  <br />In the beginning, you see all the people die.  And you think you know \\"whats up.\\"<br />But you really don't.  This is where you get a scene, about 3-4 minutes in length, that is without a doubt, one of the most unique, original--and heartstopping scenes in all of Horror.  I won't say what it is. You outta know what it is when you get to it. <br />Whatever you do, give this movie a shot.  Its not an Oscar Winner, but it is fresh.  It is worth a look, and it may not completely terrify you, but it should shake you. Should jostle you just a bit. And the very end, as you will see, in a way, will take you back to the very beginning in a nice, full-circle close.  Bon Voyage!
B00005OB0A|5.0|Fever is easily Kylie's greatest album so far and one of the best dance/pop/disco records of all time.  A wonderful set of music that showcases all of Kylie's talent since Impossible Princess.
B00005JLF5|4.0|Star Trek: Deep Space 9, by the end of its run, was the best of the Star Trek series, producing some of the most interesting, complex and daring shows that any Star Trek series ever attempted. While its first season was probably its weakest (like TNG, it really its stride in the third season), its first season was still better than TNG's (which really, with a couple of exceptions, wasn't very good until the latter part of season 2).  Deep Space 9 starts with a great cast of characters (well, with the exception of Julian, who does't become a good character until he matures -- and stops propositioning every woman on the station -- a season or two later), who are thrown together and whose relationships have some real edges to them.  The backstory is compelling, though the real arcs aren't developed until later seasons. All the Star Trek series are much more episodic than, say, Babylon 5 (which is both a strength and a weakness), but the early seasons tend to be even more so. But season 1 is a fine start.<br />Some fans haven't liked DS9, it part it seems because it does break the mold of other Star Trek series.  It's not about exploring the galaxy, but is instead a character-driven drama set at a dangerous cross-roads in space. And by it's later seasons, it breaks the mold in yet other ways, doing things with the characters that are unlike anything any other Star Trek series has attempted.  But if you go into the series without expecting the original series or TNG, but simply go looking for good science fiction, you'll find it here.

B00005JLZ9|5.0|Best movie I've seen in the first quarter of 2003.  This movie twists and turns like no other.  If your a fan of movies like The Usual Suspects, you'll love Basic.  I'll definately be adding this to my DVD collection when its released.  I highly reccomend coughing up the[money] to see this film in the theaters, its worth it.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This album is an alltime classic which seems to sound better with every remastering. I originally bought the 20th Anniversary issue and treasure it. This latest version surpases that one in sound quality by miles. Even if you only have a modest Stereo system like me it still sounds fantastic and I am sure that those who have a 5.1 mix are drolling right now. It sounds great in both formats and this is the version of the album to have. Bass and treble are even better and all the soundscapes that make this album such a joy are even more detailed. Nick Mason's drums seem to have better definition and Roger Water's bass shine. David Gilmour's guitar tone is as big as ever and Rick Wright's Keyboards and piano work seem to have benefited the most from this SACD release. You can't go wrong folks wheteher you have a 5.1 system or standard stereo system you will NOTICE a difference! Thank You James Guthrie for making the BEST album sound even better.
B000002AGN|2.0|Here's a new one for your enjoyment. This album is a poor man's Bill Evans. That's right, Mark, I do like white pianists. Bill Evans, perhaps the greatest jazz pianist ever, and his trio's recording put this stale attempt to shame. That's fact; not opinion. Whereas Brubeck plays some daring solos he comes nowhere near the harmonic invention of Evans. Is my journalism offending you yet? As a musician for all but TWO years of my life I find it funny to question my abilities to play in 5/4 time. May as well be 3/4 time since it's just as easy to read and play. I seriously think you're an old man since you have no clue how boring the drum solo is; indeed a flacid attempt at any sort of polyrhythmic invention. I suggest some Elvin Jones. Lastly, to deny that this won fame because it was headed by a white musician is TOTALLY ignoring the racism that pervaded the music industry during this time. That is not to say that it cannot be admired on its own merits. So, spare me, nay, us all, your &quot;lack of ethnocentrism&quot; as I'm sure you'd be quick to label it. I won't even make the obvious comparison between Dave Brubeck and Eminem and their sales figures. I'll leave it up to you to make up your mind. After all, I'm just informing, which is what journalism does.<br />Later Gator
0140277447|5.0|The book is great, it takes the story from three perspectives and in a very historically correct and concise recreation of a forgotten story.  I was brought to tears many times while reading this book, a must read.  Strongly recommended. A+
B00005QFE5|4.0|Indeed, as the other reviewers indicate, this is a beautiful film -  at times recalling scenes from films like Doctor Zhivago and a musical theme that is somehow reminiscent of Titanic. I bought it for my mother-in-law whose own life story it brought to mind. She left China at 80, after having lost her own \\"village school teacher\\" after 62 years of marriage. Yet, when I watched it with her, we both knew that it did not \\"ring true\\". <br />The problem is simply this: the story is not Chinese. The characters, the scenery, the themes, the acting and the photography are all exquisite - anyone would have to admit. But for some reason, the producer/director has chosen to project a very Western story on a Chinese screen. <br />No Chinese girl (at least not a mainlander) would have ever behaved so brashly in the face of new love. Western values are showy, direct, forceful. Chinese values, being the product of a culture whose two traditional faces are Taoism and Confucianism, are subtle, refined and all the more precious for being so.<br />The scene where the girl ran to meet the new teacher on the road could have happened. The scene where she cooks for him most certainly would have. But the scene where she runs after the horse cart that is taking him away - having just spoken with him for the first time - most certainly would not. And the scene where her mother tells the assemblage lurking over her sick daughter - \\"I don't know what to do for her unless he comes back\\" could not be more absurd. I am sure Chinese audiences around the world laughed, blushed and winced at this scene - as they must have at the scene where the Mayor discovers the girl in the deserted school. <br />In the old days, a young girl making such overtures to a man would have been remanded to the custody of her parents - or, if less fortunate, shunned by a village outraged at her loss of self-respect.<br />I suspect that  Zhang Yimou, in his increasing overtures for recognition from the Hollywood, thoughtit best to cast the story in terms that Westerners could understand. I only hope that he will have enough faith in himself to return to his true voice - and, as Hemingway said, \\"write truly\\" - for his earlier films are treasures - something that I hope he realizes, whether Hollywood with all its cheap techno-glitter - ever acknowledges him or not. After all, the voice of Chinese culture is subtlety, depth and aesthetic - not rock-em-knock-em sex and violence that the audience forgets 10 minutes after the ending titles. And an Oscar, after all, doesn't count for very much compared to A Dream of Red Mansions or a moon that shines equally for its viewers on boths sides of an ocean. (if you don't understand the reference ask a Chinese person about poetry).<br />There is one respect, however, in which the movie excels beyond all expectations - and in this, one has to wonder if Hollywood had some small part in the notion suggested by Titanic: the projection of the forlorn old woman onto her former, beautiful self and of that young, passionate girl onto the old, careworn woman who still goes to the school to listen for her husband's voice. They are one and the same - time has done its damage, as it always does - and yet, what is human remains victorious through the simple and unassuming endurance of love. <br />Oh yes - my mother-in-law - her marriage was arranged. Yet it survived a world war, two revolutions and the Great Leap Foward.  When the soul of her life left this world, she came to America to teach this round-eye how to be a human being. And thus, here we are.
0375760067|4.0|When one finishes \\"Casterbridge,\\" one is immediately struck by its place in the development of the novel.  Hardy came after Dickens and before James, and his style intrigues as you connect parts of it to the former, parts to the latter.<br /><br />His plotting is sort of Dickens \\"lite.\\"  There are mysterious benefactors, sudden tragic deaths, reversals of fortune, paternity mysteries, ect.  His prose is cleaner and easier to read than both Dickens and James; \\"Casterbridge\\" scans better than \\"Bleak House\\" or \\"The Wings of the Dove.\\"<br /><br />The story begins when a pastoral laborer, in a drunken rage, sells his wife and child one evening (I hate it when that happens...).  When he wakes the next morning, abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life.  The novel truly begins eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him.  In the course of the rest of the novel, we witness the fall of the now Mayor of Casterbridge, brought about by his own character flaws and the interventions of fate.<br /><br />Henchard, the main character, is a facinating combination of hot-spirited volition and turn-on-a-dime repentance.  He is quick to do things which damn him but just as quick to admit his guilt. He is a wonderful character and a precursor to the later \\"psychological\\" novels of James and Forster.  The satellite characters remind one of Dickens, but they are not nearly as startling and interesting, but of course, a character such as Henchard never existed in all of Dickens.<br /><br />The novel proceeds to its forgone conclusion inexorably, albiet with a few melodromatic touches, yet it sustains its tone and readibility due mostly to Henchard, and the dramatic situations Hardy puts him through.<br /><br />Well worth a look.
B00004VW0V|5.0|Many fans and critics feel that Cat Stevens overstepped with this album. I couldn't disagree more. Being a Stevens fan and an accomplished musician myself, I recognize the title track, Foreigner Suite, for what it is. A Masterpiece! <br />I have been listening to this track for thirty years and I still discover musical nuances that I hadn't heard before. The arrangements, orchestrations, phrasings and lyrics in this 18 minute opus are nothing less than genius. If Mozart were alive in the 20th/21st century he would be writing music like this. If one views Foreigner Suite as a mere album track it would be a mistake. This work is a symphony.<br />Every part transitions so seamlessly into the next that the 18 minutes seem like 8. The emotions Foreigner Suite elicits range from joy to sadness, from exuberance to melancholy.<br />I can't think of an artist, other than perhaps Elton John, who could write music with such consistent emotion and quality. Not only could Cat Stevens write such achingly beautiful and complex music but he, along with several accomplished backup musicians, could perform it flawlessly live. I will never forget the two times I experienced Foreigner Suite live. <br />The first was on the hit ABC TV show of the seventies called &quot;In Concert&quot;. It was on Friday nights at 11:30 and it was simulcast in stereo on local FM stations across the country, KSFX being the San Francisco station I would listen to. Back then there was no such thing as stereo television.<br />The second time I heard Foreigner Suite live was, in fact, live and in person. One of the best concerts I ever experienced was Cat Stevens at the Oakland Coliseum Arena in the mid seventies. He performed all eighteen minutes perfectly, before the days of computers and sequencers.<br />All that's left to say is, if you're new to Cat Stevens, you haven't heard his best until you've heard Foreigner Suite. If you're a true fan then I don't need to convince you. And if you're one of the people who dismissed this incredible work of art as mediocre after one or two listens because it didn't fit the mold of what you consider to be a &quot;hit record&quot; or a &quot;Cat Stevens&quot; record then you truly can't hear the music and nothing I say will change your mind. This record broke the mold and is a true masterpiece.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is full of creativity, just like Castle in the Sky and Kiki's Delivery Service. The story is of a young girl who is transported through a \\"tunnel\\" to a strange and different world. Once her parents turn into a pig from eating too much, she tries to find a way to bring them back, while trying to get out. Haku helps her, and she falls in love with him later in the movie. Many different adventures happen in the movie. While she tries to save Haku's life, she uses her courage she never knew she had. This movie was The Most Acclaimed movie 2002, and won the oscar of Best Animated Movie.<BR>I highly recommend watching if you like anime, and even if you don't its a great movie for you and your kids. Watch it, you won't regret it!
B00006AFUR|5.0|This CD is one of the best that I've heard come from a rock/alternative band in awhile. They have a unique sound, and something that you just can't quite put your finger on. <br />The lyrics are amazing, the rifs vibrate through your body, and the overall sound is phenomenal.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0066214122|4.0|I don't believe &quot;Prey&quot; is among Crichton's better novels, though he's so talented that even when he's not hitting on all cylinders he still comes up with something pretty slick and entertaining.  My primary criticisms of this book are that the character development is a little weak and that the plot seems to fit sort of a prototypical Crichton mold without breaking new ground.  I don't think Crichton should stray away from his fascination and concern with technology in future novels, though I would like to somehow see him reinvent himself a little.  I don't know how, but I would like to see him expand his vision a little in the future.  Nonetheless, &quot;Prey&quot; is still quite a good book that most Crichton fans will enjoy.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.
6300182282|3.0|It kind of glorifies adultery, which I hate. It's fairly long, dialogue is snappy and well-paced. Writing's not bad. It's saving grace is the soundtrack with Johnny Mathis and Jane Olivor. It's the kind of movie that you watch once then let it collect dust, at least it was for me.
B00008PW2E|5.0|First off, Six Feet Under's first season was stunning, mind blowing, a dazzling piece of eye candy that will no doubt go down in TV history. Alan Ball, the show's creater is a true genuis in all shapes and forms.If for some bizzare reason you don't no about the show heres a brief summary: The show is about a family who make a living as funreal directors. They are the fisher family and live a very interesting life. Each epiosed deals with and people close to them confroting lifes daily issues in very unique and fasinating ways.*For more indepth summry see any reviews for the first season.<br /> Now, here is the second season of Six Feet Under which is in many ways a more darker season then the first and so far the third. I think what made it the best season/show was becuse of the darker subject matter being so well blended with humorous or more light weighted things. It's still very touching, off beat, warm and funny but a few disturbing death's mixed with the character of Brenda, who goes sexual out of control keeps the viewer on teh edge of their seat. In my opinion, Brenda's sexual adventures with starngers was one of the height lights of the show. They were done in a profound and memorobal fasion that was dark but did not turn the viwver off. Brenda is by far the show's most complex and intriging charachter and in this season you really explore what she is feeling and going through. The characters all explore new meanings, problems and love. Claire gets ready for college, Ruth attends a inspiring group known as the plan, David and Keith get back together, Nate deals with his AVM, and as I mentioned Brenda begins having sex with strangers. Its very dark, very fuuny, very sad, very happy, very interesting and its one of the best things ever created- aside from the gloureous and memorizing American Beauty- this season is a must have for anyone. The sooner its released the better. When you buy this DVD you will not regreat it. The DVD will transport you to the haunting realm of Six Feet Under, a place you'll never forget!
B00005YTFG|5.0|This was the forerunner of the current movie-musical craze. It's fabulous. John Leguizamo sucks, as usual, and I can't get next to Ewen McGregor doing Your Song as badly as he does, but these are small moments from an overall dazzling visual feast! Turn the lights out at home get the popcorn and prepare for the nonstop ride of your life!
B000002UZ1|5.0|While the first compilation contained 26 tracks lasting 65 minutes, this one contains 28 generally longer tracks lasting 95 minutes. The Beatles recorded fewer songs during this period so there are fewer obvious omissions. The best-known track from this period not included here is When I'm 64.<br />Of course, all their own British and American hits from the period are here, including Strawberry fields forever, Penny lane, All you need is love, Hello goodbye, Lady Madonna, Hey Jude, Get back, The ballad of John and Yoko, Come together, Something, Let it be and The long and winding road.<br />Also included are their own versions of songs that were hits for others, including With a little help from my friends (Joe Cocker), Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Elton John) and Ob-la-di ob-la-da (Marmalade).<br />As if all that were not enough, there are some brilliant album tracks, including my favorite track here, Fool on the hill. I am the walrus is a very silly song, but it has a certain appeal.<br />This is a superb collection containing almost (but not quite) all the essential Beatles tracks from the period covered.
B000059H99|5.0|Years ago, when my college girlfriend took me to this movie and told me that I would love it, I never realized how right she would be. (maybe I should have stayed with her?).  You know the story and the characters but if you haven't seen this movie in a while then perhaps it's time to see it again.  The mood, the style, the settings;  everything combines to portray the story of what can happen when you believe in yourself.  And how that belief can effect the others around you.  See it again, you won't be sorry.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Knowing how hard it is to play the guitar, I was amazed by John Mayer's ability to use the instrument at the Grammys.  I thought &quot;This kid must be amazingly talented, or sincerely blessed!&quot;  These thoughts led me to buy his CD and it was definetly worth it.  His slightly covered, light voice uplifts any and all who hear it.  John Mayer is really great, buy this CD!  Expect a lot from this fledgeling musician, we can expect great things from John!
0375414932|3.0|A good, sometimes brilliant, effort by William Boyd: a fictional diary spanning the bulk of the 20th centry &quot;written&quot; by a minor British literary figure. I found sections of this novel extremely compelling: the World War Two diaries, the New York diary, and parts of the diaries devoted to his life and education at Oxford in the 1920s. Other sections I found rather ponderous, particularly the latter sections set in Nigeria and France. Since this book is structured in the form of a diary, it lacks the forward narrative drive of a good novel. This isn't necessarily problematic but, to this reader anyway, the book drags toward the end where a novel should be building to its dramatic peak. Still, however, Boyd succeeds in conveying the sense of disillusionment and sadness of growing old and wondering &quot;is that all there is?&quot;<br />Perhaps Boyd's greatest success here is the way he manages to recreate time and place. These &quot;diaries&quot; feel very real and each page comes alive with authenticity.<br />If you're looking for an introduction to William Boyd, better start with an earlier novel of his &quot;The Ice Cream War.&quot; For all its merits, &quot;Any Human Heart&quot; is an acquired taste. It requires patience in long stretches, but overall, the effort does reap some rewards.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool's new album &quot;Lateralus&quot; is by far their best record to date. Lateralus' deeply moving lyrics and incredible harmony draw the listener in like no Tool album has ever done before. The new album shines a new light on Tool. Their once pseudo-negative outlook on life seems to have faded away. Lateralus shines forth a positive message of hope and love for life. No other band has ever reached the perfection Tool has reached in this album. Lateralus sets a new standard in music that has never been achieved. If you are looking for something completely unique and amazing, I highly recommend getting this album.
B00008CLOA|5.0|There's very little to say about this brilliant album that hasn't already been said. Though after three decades, &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; is still a very compelling and absorbing album to listen to. The new remaster sounds great on a standard CD player as well as the SACD layers. The 5.1 mix is reason enough to run out and purchase an SACD player, which is saying a lot considering how great Alan Parsons quadraphonic stereo mix was. The CD's packaging is also nicely done, combining parts of the original Hipgnosis artwork along with artwork and pictures from previous reissues of the album. A first class repackaging of one of the greatest rock albums of all time.
B000089CPF|5.0|that's generally the test of a good recording for me. I've run &quot;Feast of Wire&quot; every day since I picked it up at Calexico's show here in L.A. a few weeks ago. I'm a big fan of the band...I like the slow, thoughtful songs as much as I like the one's with that sharp trumpet punch. Unlike Hot Rail, (which I could listen to all day long...anyone who's driven a desert highway has lived &quot;Fade&quot;), the songs on Feast of Wire are shorter and tighter. Having spent time with the longer pieces on some of their other recordings, its tough for this fan to adjust to these quick pieces, but I'm there.<br />Calexico has a knack for creating extraordinary musical phrases that attach to your brain. These bits show up on the radio show &quot;This American Life&quot; all the time for just that reason. &quot;Feast of Wire&quot; is filled with them. There have been times in the last week or two where no fewer than three of these songs, parts of them anyway, have been bouncing around my head at the same time. Just try to forget &quot;Attack! El Roboto Attack!&quot;. <br />If you like the experimental stuff Los Lobos puts together, or their side project the Latin Playboys, the music on this or any other Calexico release will probably work for you.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Hybrid Theory is one of the greatest CD's in recent history, Reanimation in my opinion broke new ground when it came to remix CD's and was great, and now with Meteora Linkin Park does it again! If you liked Hybrid Theory, you will like this album, you may not like every song right away, but let it grow on you before you make up your mind. They have tried some new things on this album, experimenting with new sounds and strange tempos.<br />1. Foreward - It is anly about 20 sec long, what can you say, it is what it is.<br />2. Don't Stay - 5/5 Great opening song. Similar to songs from Hybrid, but a little heavier, especially towards the end. Probably one of my top 3 favorites from Meteora.<br />3. Somewhere I Belong - 5/5 You already know this one, as it is there first single. Great song, even mix of Mike and Chester. The perfect first single.<br />4. Lying From You - 5/5 Great rapping by Mike, awesone vocals by Chester. Another one on the more heavy songs from the album, Chester really gives his vocal chords a real workout.<br />5. Hit The Floor - 3/5 Good song, it is mostly Mike. There is something about this song that seems a little weak that I can't quite put my finger on. It seems like a rushed song.<br />6. Easier To Run - 5/5 I loved this song from the second I heard it. It has an epic feel to it, I believe it could be their next single, and I see them making a BIG video for it. This could be the &quot;In The End&quot; of this album, it is much softer than &quot;In The End&quot; but I cant help to be reminded of it.<br />7. Faint - 4/5 This is a strange song. It is definatly very different from their other stuff, it is very fast. I didn't like it at first, but it is growing on me.<br />8. Figure.09 - 4/5 Good song. I don't agree with some of the other reviewers that say this is the best song. Chesters vocals are really good on this one.<br />9. Breaking The Habit - 3/5 I said that &quot;Faint&quot; was a strange song, this one is really strange. Through most of it, it doesnt even sound like LP at all. It is very fast and very choppy. Maybe it will grow on me.<br />10. From The Inside - 5/5 If &quot;Easier To Run&quot; isn't the next single, this one will be. It may be the best song on the album, it may even become their biggest song ever.<br />11. Nobody's Listening - 4/5 OK, everybody is saying how much they don't like this song, and how the flute doesn't work, I disagree, I like it. It is different, and it won't go down as their best song, but I think it is good.<br />12. Session - 2/5 I am not a big fan of instrumentals to begin with, this one is especially boring. I guess Joe needed something to do. (He doesn't have nearly as much stuff on this album, which is a shame)<br />13. Numb - 4/5 Good closing to the album, doesn't grab me like some of the other songs, but is still very good. It definatly sounds like a closing song.<br />Album Pakaging - 3/5 The extra DVD is great, they really care about the fans, and it shows in the DVD. The booklet is huge, but the two problems I have are the artwork inside the booklet and the cover. The art inside is mostly just pictures of spray cans, paint brushes, and a few scribbles. The cover is just a picture of a guy crouched down spray painting the floor. After the great album cover and art with Reanimation they could have done much better.<br />As a whole this is a great album, it may take some getting used to and you may not like every song right away. If you are already a LP fan and have the other two albums, get this one. If you don't know their music yet and are new to them, get &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; first.it, it doesnt even sound like LP at all. It is very fast and very choppy. Maybe it will grow on me.<br />10.

B00005JKJA|1.0|This movie is about... <br />...well, it's not about anything. There are a lot of characters, including an amnesiac woman befriending an aspiring actress, and a movie producer that has his hand forced by weird mafiosi to cast a certain woman in his movie, but there is no coherent thread or story, not even the patina of naturalism. This is the most disjointed and pointless movie I've ever seen. It's as if a pitcher with muscular dystrophy threw symbols around until there were enough of them to make a two-hour movie.<br />...The first third was somewhat interesting, but the rest is such a meaningless jumble of symbols that it makes you hate film just on principle.
6305388458|4.0|...Overall, this probably isn't the funniest Monty Python work.  The Search for the Holy Grail and many of the Flying Circus skits are funnier, so if you are looking to be introduced to Monty Python you may want to try one of those first.  But if you are a fan of Monty Python and you haven't seen this, you definitely need to.  Oh yes, for anyone that cares about these kinds of things, there is full frontal nudity in the film, but it is very, very brief.  A definite must see for fans of British comedy.
B0000062GK|5.0|This cd, is, without a doubt, the best Joe Satriani cd that I currently own, and I do own them all.<BR>I bought this cd back in 99, recently when it just came out.  <BR>The title track, crystal planet, had a fast paced &amp; beautiful melody to it.  <BR>Love thing, is a beautiful piece of work.  Joe definitely knows how to use that wah pedal to give the sound a nice, slow, &amp; touchy feel.<BR>Track #5 has just a grove to it, different from any other song I've heard.  The bass lines on this song are very catchy.<BR>My favorite in this cd is ceremony.  The solo in that song is like no other I've ever heard, fast &amp; accurate just like Joe meant it to be.<BR>If you like guitar music, this is a must.  It's all instrumental, so keep that in mind.<BR>No track is of my dislike.<BR>Go &amp; get it now!
B00008BXJF|5.0|I saw King Crimson in the fall on 2002.  I listened to some of their new material from &quot;The Power to Believe&quot;.  I liked it then and I like it now.  <br />It is especially good now because &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; is a concept album if there ever was one.  When I heard the EP from the tour it did not follow the theme of this album. Now new versions of several songs and acappella make this a very listenable album.<br />It appears to be a reversion to more power rock(?) but I really enjoy this.<br />I have listened to King Crimson for 30 years so I am glad that this is hard to catogorize.  This is smooth prog rock.

This is the album that set Joe on the billboards for a while.<BR>Track #1 has a good melody, fast pace &amp; rock sound.  <BR>Including the song, &quot;Always with me, always with you,&quot; makes this album a great cd to add to your collection.<BR>Surfing with the aline, Echo, Always With me...., Satch boogie, are all great tracks that are included in this cd.<BR>This is definitely a must have for any fan.
B000002MY3|4.0|My friends had this album when I was little, and they used to take it on holiday with us, so now I'm as familiar with it as the back of my own hand.  It taught me what the word \\"....\\" meant, besides helping me along the way to appreciating \\"proper\\" music as opposed to manufactured ..... I gotta be thankful for that.  Even though my musical tastes have changed somewhat since I bought this album, \\"You Oughta know\\" is still an excellent feminist headbanger.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Ah, Linkin Park. After their long and respected career that has so far consisted of an album and their remix album, Linkin<br />Park returns to us with Meteora, a majestic opus that lasts a breathtaking 36 minutes, leaving the listener in awe at how this<br />incredible group could have packed so much music on just one cd.<br />The album starts out strongly with Foreword, which consists of some random noises that only add to the staggering length of<br />this album. Foreword smoothly transforms into the first \\"real song,\\" Don't Stay. After the incredible talents of \\"Phoenix\\" and the guy who always wears earmuffs in his videos, Chester mourns soulfully... A few seconds<br />later... uh oh, what happened here? Chester is ANGRY. Open about his teen angst, Chester screams about his broken relationship with his mother, presumably about how she forgot his birthday party.<br />The next track, Somewhere I Belong, turns up the angst full volume. It starts with some sound effects courtesy of the DJ and<br />some beautiful piano &agrave; la \\"In The End.\\" There's the standard nu metal riffage for a few seconds, and the rapper comes in, with<br />Chester wailing ocasionally, like a girl, about how confused he is.<br />Somewhere I Belong is a track that illustrates one of the things I love most about Linkin Park: BEAUTIFUL PIANO. The<br />beautiful piano piece found here is incredible, the work of someone who has played countless years. However, I can't help but<br />wonder : who is this pianist, this genius, this modern-day Chopin? My money is on Chester. It seems fit that Chester, who aside from being a vocalist extraordinaire, is also a gifted musician.<br />While the rest of the album is equally a tour de force, the last two tracks deserve special mention. On track 12, the mystery<br />pianist we met on Somewhere I Belong is back to blow minds as he resumes his position on this two minute epic, easily one of<br />the most complex instrumentals of all time. Thankfully, he sticks around for the last track, Numb. Numb ends Meteora in all<br />Linkin Park's splendor. Chester doing his best Justin Timberlake imitation. The expert pianist at his finest, playing a piano piece with such depth and complexity that it only rivals a one-handed Mary Had A Little Lamb. The drummer pounding his drum kit so fast it has to be heard to be believed. The guitarist showing us that he is truly the Jimi Hendrix of our generation.<br />Beautiful.ks around for the last track, Numb. Numb ends Meteora in all<br />Linkin Park's splendor.

B000002BBY|5.0|And that reason is ... it rocks, pure and simple.  Whatever mood you're in, this album has a song to suit it.  My personal favourite is the title track, which is darker in tone than the rest of the album, but that suits me fine.  It would be almost impossible not to like this album, as it crosses so many different genres.  It's cool.  Go buy it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of the best bands ever. I'm not exaggerating here. Every single track on this album is good or great, with one exception (&quot;Hello&quot;). This is something that I cannot say about any other album that I've listened to. I've never been much of a goth-rock type, but I love this album. Even my mom likes some of the songs! This group combines deep, emotional lyrics with beautifully written, rockingly performed melodies. The worthless Realmedia samples on this website cannot do this group justice.<br />Buy this album. Period. You'll be glad you did.
B000002AS3|5.0|When I bought this CD, I was having a bad day.  The weather was gloomy and grey, and I was bored.  I had some time to kill, so I went and sat by the river with my walkman, and listened to this album for the first time.  Suddenly, the sun came out, and listening to the music made me feel alright again.  Very few albums have that effect on my the very first time I listen to them.  I never thought it would be possible, but this is better than \\"Morning glory\\".  Go buy it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|... \\"BRITNEY\\" is very similar to Kylie Minogue's 1990 classic album \\"RHYTHM OF LOVE\\". Just as Kylie did before her, Britney has finally started to take chances with her music. Sadly ..., many fans didn't understand this new sexually impowered Britney. As \\"RHYTHM OF LOVE\\" was an extrodinary and brilliant push Kylie made towards adult-hood, Britney has did the same. \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" is a song that many people had mixed reactions too. Just as \\"Better The Devil You Know\\" kicked off \\"RHYTHM OF LOVE\\" and Kylie into a new sexier and more saucy direction, \\"Slave\\" does so equally with it's infamous video and 2001 MTV Video Music Awards Performace. \\"BRITNEY\\" is a balance of old and new. \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Not A GIRL\\", \\"Lonely\\", and \\"Boys\\" are take Britney in new direction of Pop/Dance/Funk. \\"Cinderella\\", \\"I Love Rock and Roll\\", and \\"Bombastic Love\\" play upon what made Britney a star....good pop song that can be a little cheesy. This album has gone on to sell 14 million units since November 2001.... This album is a fresh start for Britney and her fans.
B0000797IO|4.0|I liked this movie...It was almost like one of those independent films W/ lots of layers, the kind you think about afterwards. (A nice change from the junk out there.)  (Was it an independent film?)<br /> Jennifer Aniston is searching for more, more than what she has.  Working all day in a super-market, going home to a man she doesn't really love, then doing the whole thing over and over and over again. Because of her inability to change her environment, she has an affair with a younger man who works at the super-market too, who just happens to have as many problems as she has.  Unfortunately, adding to her dismal existence.<br />The entire film is filled with dissatisfied, robotic, people who cannot or will not change.  Who accept the situations they are in.  Who are, put mildly, stuck in a big, fat rut. <br />In reality, many people are living like this.  Just settling for whatever it is they feel they deserve.  A loveless marriage, a job they detest, no direction.<br />So...<br />They go through the motions, like Jennifer.  One day after the next, one month after the next, one year after the next...<br />Until it's too late.

0783225903|2.0|I was somewhat blown away by this movie when it was first released. At the time I new nothing of the wrangling behind the scences by the director and the studio which wanted to edit the film against the strong protest by Mr. Gilliam. After a recent viewing I have to agree with the studio to cut this film down to something that resembles a story and not the \\"look how creative I am\\" film Gilliam wanted.  Once I saw the flights of fancy, the endless symbolism and in your face \\"isn't this terrible\\" scenes for the second or third time I was not enlightened but just bored by the directors heavy hand. The Special edition box set has some embarrassingly pretentious scenes with the director defending his \\"artistic virtue\\" and wallowing in his artistic excesses.  Mr. Gillian makes movies that only young art students can enjoy, at least until they graduate that is.
0770428231|5.0|Being male, I found that reading this book along with my female friend helped me to appreciate it more than I would have on my own. She commented, several times, that &quot;language and observation make this book a sustained poem&quot; and I agreed several times. Her perspective was needed and appreciated. It is definitely a book ABOUT women and FOR women, but us dudes can get something out of it too... because it is brilliantly written.<br />It is not only an &quot;Atwood&quot; but one of the better &quot;Atwoods&quot;!<br />The author has stated that Cat's Eye is &quot;about how girlhood traumas continue into adult life&quot; and that is it in a nutshell.<br />When the painter Elaine Risley returns to Toronto for a retrospective of her work, she is confronted with the memories of her childhood... mysteries to unravel, others to tie up and lay to rest. Elaine the child, had a temperament that allowed other girls to belittle and dominate her.<br />In a word, she was bullied.<br />And no one bullied her as much as Cordelia did.<br />When Elaine is brought back to the geography of her past, she finds that she has to come to terms with her feelings about Cordelia... this retrospective of her WORK turns into a retrospective of her LIFE.<br />Through flashbacks galore, and in writing that is spare and bleeding with cut-wrist exposure, Atwood leaves no part of Elaine's wounds unsalted.<br />Here is a question that I think the thoughtful reader will be asked to ponder:<br />Does &quot;closure&quot; mean annihilation/renunciation of memory, or acceptance/reconciliation of memory?<br />Or as my friend and I put it: Does Elaine still have her Cat's Eye with her when she returns to Vancouver?<br />This is not a plot-driven, but a personality or character driven book. Those who think that sound-bites on T.V. are too lengthy should probably stay away from it.<br />Cat's Eye would be a great Book Club selection because of the discussion and opinion that it is sure to stimulate. I'm going to rate it closer to five stars than four.loser to five stars than four.
B00008BXJF|4.0|I have LEVEL FIVE and HAPPY... Fripp has always said that when King Crimson music is made a group calling itself King crimson will appear. While I truly enjoy this album(much awaited after the superior LEVEL FIVE and the HAPPY... ep); I find that this album by the current Crimso's is actually an adjunct to the two cds above.<br />It cannot be listened to and appreciated without the above context. So? Is King Crimson repeating itself? My answer is yes.<BR>This 'Industrial Jazz' field has been furrowed many times since the CONSTRUCTION OF LIGHT album. That is why I have a sneaking suspicion that this lineup of the Crim will be no more after their current tour.

I'm listening to &quot;Hail to the Thief,&quot; the new Radiohead album (with the intention of buying it, I swear), and I'm struck by how wonderfully it references and builds on &quot;OK Computer.&quot;  OK Computer is the basis for not only a slew of wonderful work by Radiohead, but also by Coldplay, Travis, and a whole host of other bands.  Buy the album that solidified Radiohead's place in the rock &amp; roll canon.
B00005JLEU|3.0|This fantasy won the Academy award. It was typical Japanese fare, similar to the old 'Speed Racer' my children watched on t.v. It was an antimated GHOSTBUSTERS or similar to the Scooby-Doo movie. <br />Village Roadshow Pictures are releasing some really strange productions such as the primitive prequel to DREAMCATCHER. It seemed to be based on a Japenese video game as in early Nintendo. It contained weird animation, artificial acting (no emotion), and bad voice overs. Even the skinny woman with superhuman strength sounded like a man. Bette Ford made a good \\"old\\" woman.   There were some subtle references to various classics, thus the fairy tale aspect. The male 'lead' had a Little Lord Faulteroy haircut and looked like Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra. He had a feminine hand (long, slender fingers) like that of the father in the famous painting of THE PRODIGAL SON. He was put under a spell and transformed into a weird dragon. <br />After the hungry phantom swallowed the frog (WIND IN THE WILLOWS) whole, later he was regurgitated and revived -- as in the story of Jonah in the Whale. <br />Even the \\"Pillsbury doughboy\\" baby of the incredibly old madame looked like Medulsa with snakes in his long swirling hair. He is transformed for awhile into a strange-looking mouse which is carried around by a real-sounding mosquito. He looked like a Sumari wrestler. <br />Everyone had such wide big eyes and no noses. At first, I thought it was going to be just another \\"eel\\" story, but it was just as much a Japanese version of Spiderman. <br />There was a court jester tempted by the gold, a skull phone of the 'old woman' gnome, poor Sin knee-deep in mire at the bathhouse where Sludge was a smelly guest. The music kept the atmosphere of a geisha instead of a pig farm. <br />There was an abundance of exotic plants and a spectacular hawthorne bush. Other colorful flora abounded in this little paradise by day/Hell after dark. <br />The rain clouds were symbolic of foreboding things to come. Other clouds and the night sky were somewhat realistic-looking, except for the moon. <br />I've never before seen such industrious sootballs. And when they played charades, it was a sight to behold. <br />Their elevators are faster even than those in the Sears Tower in Chicago. One final test (where is Sin?) was a ride on the ghost train to the Swamp on which the conductor shredded the tickets, for whatever reason. <br />As in any fantasy, it takes awhile for memories to return, and only love could break the spell. <br />The public t.v. series SAGWA, misadventures of the Siamese cats, is much more enjoyable than this academy award-winning feature.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I just got the DVD today. It comes with DTS and hours of features. I had the VHS version and was quite happy with that but now I am happier. The DVD version is definitely better in many ways.<BR>For those who haven't got Beatles Anthology, buy it and you won't regret it. For those who have the LD or VHS version (and quite happy with it), buy the DVD version and you'll be happier!
B00008H2LE|5.0|Linkin Park's sophomore album, Meteora, is nothing less than spectacular.  While a second album has a tendency to be a curse to most bands, Linkin Park has exceeded any expectations placed upon them as a result of their multi-platinum smash debut &quot;Hybrid Theory.&quot;  The dynamic mix of vocals that made &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; as great as it was can be found on Meteora as well.  Each member of the band seems to have grown in their respective talent and it is quite apparent on this album.  Chester's wide range of vocal skills are on display on Meteora as well as the others' creativity with composing sogs.  Meteora is one of those rare albums that can be listened to from start to finish without skipping any songs and will actually leave you wanting more.  At a short duration of only 36 minutes, it would seem that the songs would have something missing from them as well as the album as a whole, but instead the contrary is true.  The time flies by without any notice of how long/short the album is as a result of how engaging the songs are.  The sheer diversity of each song makes this a classic album that would be damaged by any categorization such as &quot;nu-metal&quot; or &quot;rap-rock&quot;.  For anyone who hasn't heard of Linkin Park or who is looking for some good, solid music, this is the album to get.
B00004UEIF|1.0|This is clearly a jazz classic. I had already owned the XRCD version as well as the old CD and ordered this when I thought that there was a SACD version available.<br />Warning - it is not a SACD inspite of the ads. Yes it is an impressive 20 bit JVC DSD recording - BUT - not a SACD.<br />Be warned.
B00008J4P5|5.0|First of all, do NOT listen to any other reviews written thus far.  THERE IS NO BASS ANYWHERE IN THE WHITE STRIPES.  If anybody looked in to it or had any musical talent, they would know that Jack is using an Octave pedal, which takes down the sound of every string by 1 or 2 octaves.  This gives the impression that there is bass used.  But I can guarantee that there is no bass used by the White Stripes.  I never want to hear such claims about an excellent band again, especially by complete idiots.  Anyway, every song is awesome.
0451196716|5.0|The &quot;Long Walk&quot; is one of the earliest books written by Stephen King under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, and it's not a horror story per se.  King wrote this during his freshman year in college during the Fall of 1966 and Spring of 1967.  This is a great book. And, one can tell at this early time of writing King had a knack for description, in addition to creative ideas and story-telling.  When King submitted it in a writing competition it was rejected without any comments.  So, he through it into an old box.  <br />In the &quot;Long Walk&quot; the backgrounds, motivations, beliefs, and social attitudes come out in the characters as they walk together. Ray Garraty (the main), McVries, Olson, Baker, Stebbins, and Barkovitch.  Each has a distinct personality.  The latter, Barkovitch, is the vituperative, harping, anti-social antagonist.  <br />What piques the reader and human nature, is that these guys chose to participate in this competition.  They were among 100 selected across America.  The very few to be accepted for the Long Walk.  The prize for the single winner is everything you want for the rest of your life.  For the rest of the 99 they get to rest, eternally. <br />Like in almost all good stories, the conversations among these fellas can lead one to think about his/herself.<br />To find out who wins, read this great piece of work by a young Stephen King.
B000003CMC|5.0|While I own and covet the more &quot;LP-sounding&quot; Mobile Fidelity (&quot;Original Master Recording Ultradisk&quot; gold CD) version, this remastered version is easily competitive and a whole lot cheaper. The sound quality is now excellent and the treble is no longer muted.<BR>  I have little to say about this albums content that has not been said before: it is arguably the best Allmans album and is certainly a must-own. What are you waiting for?
B00008GKEG|5.0|(4/1/03) Whatever you may have thought of The Beatles Anthology documentary in its earlier incarnations (broadcast, VHS, Laser), the most compelling reason to purchase this DVD release lies in the last of the five discs: \\"Special Features.\\"<br />Those already familiar with the Anthology as a film will, as I did, look to this disc first. The new material, already mentioned in other reviews, succeeds in completing the documentary project as an addendum; the material provides interesting insights into the production of the Anthology film, as well as the CD's and the two \\"new\\" videos/songs \\"Free as A Bird\\" and \\"Real Love.\\"<br />The bonus materials also give us (perhaps unintentionally) a more lively insight into the interpersonal dynamics of the remaining Beatles in the late 1990's (the kind of realism so called \\"Reality TV\\" vainly contrives). Shot during what was no doubt an arduous, yet therapeutic re-examination of their past, the group reminiscences (edited from material filmed either for the production or the later marketing of the Anthology) are fascinating. Those well versed in Beatles and post-Beatles rumor and lore will no doubt have much to examine (or \\"read into\\") when watching Messrs McCartney, Harrison, and Starr cheerfully and sometimes tiredly reminisce in both song and in story. (Contrary to some rumors, there are really no new song performances here - all are informal and incomplete dalliances.) Detail oriented Beatle-ologists will no doubt examine and re-examine everything said and sung during these group sessions, as well as everything unsaid and unsung. \\"Regular\\" Beatle fans will enjoy the often funny anecdotes and the music, no matter how \\"impromptu\\" or unpolished.<br />As a package, the DVD is faithful to the original Anthology release in artwork and packaging, taking its cues from Klaus Voorman's poster wall concept, with an animated version of the collage serving as theme to the menu navigation on the discs. The sound has been re-mastered for DTS, Dolby 5.1 and PCM Stereo, which is arguably great for the music, but bears little impact on the interviews.<br />As an owner of the older VHS set, my only minor unpleasant surprise in viewing the new DVD's was the odd choice of fonts for the titles and subtitles. In re-mastering the film for DVD, the producers stripped away all the original \\"Copperplate Gothic\\" establishing titles to clear way for the DVD's digital subtitles. While understandable (it arguably shows that the film was consciously re-mastered for disc) the digital \\"sans serif\\" titles lack the film style that gave the original documentary visual sophistication. Again, a minor point.<br />Those looking to update their ownership of the Anthology would do well do consider this latest technology release. The DVD replaces aging tapes and the Special Features complete and rejuvenate the film., Dolby 5.1 and PCM Stereo, which is arguably great for the music, but bears little impact on the interviews.<br />As an owner of the older VHS set, my only minor unpleasant surprise in viewing the new DVD's was the odd choice of fonts for the titles and subtitles.

B000002UAU|4.0|This is not my favorite Beatles album, nor is it my least favorite, but it is undeniably a pivotal moment in popular music history.<BR>  Unfortunately, this classic sounds rather muted and muddy when compared to more recently remastered efforts from contemperary artists. This is true of all of the Beatles albums save the &quot;1&quot; collection. While in the Beatles' case, their mid-eighties remastering job is not as aggregiously bad as was the original Rolling Stones Abco job (recently rectified), it is still very poor relative to what can be obtained with more modern methods.<BR>   Recent remastering on Cream, Blind Faith, The Allman Bros., Clapton, Hendrix, Jethro Tull and other contemporary artists' work show this quite conclusively, and I rather doubt that the original Beatles masters will be as difficult to find as other groups...<BR>  If I were in the market for this album right now, I would not purchase it, as the sond quality is too mediocre, and the recent &quot;1&quot; mastering hints that this may be soon fixed.
B00005K9LN|5.0|This is one of Priest's best albums. The first 3 songs, &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;, &quot;Metal Gods&quot; and &quot;Breaking The Law&quot; are awesome, the kind you listen to over and over again. I don't like &quot;Grinder&quot; and &quot;United&quot; and &quot;You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise&quot; that much, but &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; is a classic. The next two songs, and the two bonus are not that great either. But the first three, especially #1 and #3 are great, great, great, you should buy this album just for those.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I really liked Hybrid Theory. It was fresh, it was original, and it was everything I liked in a CD. Meteora, however, was none of these. It was a great disappointment. <br />Each song by itself is actually pretty good. But when you look at the CD as a whole, each song sounds incredibly similar. EVERY SINGLE SONG (except for the 13 second intro...why wasn't this just combined with the second song into one track?) has a sampled intro that soon ends with a heavy guitar riff. After that, it's mostly the same: Rapped verses and screamed choruses.<br />Linkin Park's musical progression has been close to 0 in the almost 2 years since Hybrid Theory was released. It's clear that they'd rather stick with the Hybrid Theory album-selling formula rather than make interesting music.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Strangers In The Night is by far one of the best UFO albums. Its a great album, esp. if you're into UFO. If, however, you are just a standard Hard Rock fan this is probably the only UFO CD you ever need. If thats the case, though, you are probably better off with Essential UFO. Bottom line... if you're into UFO and don't have this album, but it now. If you aren't into UFO that much, buy Essential UFO. If you already have this album, but not the &quot;Expanded Edition&quot;, buy this; &quot;Hot 'N' Ready&quot; is worth the extra price alone.
B00005JLSC|5.0|This was an amazing movie.  If you have read the reviews by \\"A 12 year old viewer\\" do not pay any attention to those reviews.  This person has no idea of what a good movie/musical is and has no appreciation for these types of things.  Chicago was simply wonderful and I suggest that everyone see it.  The music was great and the dancing was great.  The choreogrophy I think was by Bob Fosse and it was amazing.  It is also amazing that all the actors do their own dancing.  Richard Gere is an excellent tap dancer!<br />  Billy Flynn: That's Chicago.
B000060OFT|1.0|This movie was shown to us in my English class, along with the classic version. This movie was getting on my nerves right up to the gas station scene. First of all, the use of the Shakespearean language in a modern setting DOES NOT WORK, period. It doesn't make sense in a modern setting. They call their guns swords for crying out loud! Second, the acting is terrible. The worst actor of them all was Tybalt. Third, they just act stupid. I hated just about everybody that starred in this \\"masterpiece.\\" You see Mercutio dressed like a woman, the reason is never explained. I wanted to beat ... him because of his stupidity. You're better off watching the classic version, butI didn't really like that one either.
038572179X|1.0|I agree with the other reviewers who were left wondering why this book has gotten such good reviews.  At best it was tedious; at worst simply boring.  Silly plot, plodding descriptions of a confusing profusion of characters, none well enough drawn to draw us into their lives--it was difficult, right to the end of the book, to keep them straight.  A huge disappointment after all the hype surrounding this novel.

B00005JLZ9|3.0|John McTiernans Basic is very loud: 80% of the dialogue is shouted; a hurricane is blowing during most of the movie and the lighting and set d&eacute;cor screams Army camouflage at you relentlessly.<br />But I suppose if you were going to cast any two actors to scream and yell their heads off during an entire film, no two actors could do that better than John Travolta (looking slim and trim) and Samuel L. Jackson.<br />The plot is intriguing for about 60% of this film until the incomprehensible twists and turns and twists and turns again start to make it seem like a poor mans version of The Usual Suspect.<br />Travolta and Jacksons charisma makes up for the lack of a coherent screenplay for a while but even they are not able to make this thing work 100%.<br />Chalk Basic up to a good try but no cigar, guys.
B000001GQD|5.0|Do I love controversy? Yes! Everybody seems to praise this CD because of the unsurpassed Rachmaninov. They would buy this CD just for the first part. I'll take it for the second part, the Tchaikovsky that they all try to demolish.<br />The Rachmaninov piano concerto played by Richter is irrefutably the best, but this composition tends to make me sleepy, although I'm very romantic, very sensitive, very emotional, very sentimental. I don't understand why I never liked this famous composition. Am I different or can't I appreciate good music?<br />The Tchaikovsky piano concerto No. 1 was recorded in 1962, and the sound is amazingly vibrant. I never liked Karajan, but I deeply enjoy his conducting the Wiener Symphoniker here.<br />Richter is so astounding in this recording that I can forget the rest: Argerich/Kiril Kondrashin(Bavarian Radio Orchestra), Shura Cherkassky/Leopold Ludwig(Berlin Philharmonic), Kissin/Karajan, Fasil Say/Yuri Temirkanov, etc.<br />How can they complain about Richter and Karajan in this recording? Too slow and boring? Oh no! It's slow, but exciting, thrilling, grandiose, beautiful! The slow and sensitive moments are delightful and deep. They allow you to softly fly to a fantastic world of dreams, a magical world of fantasy, and then whirl to the world of human reality, of life, with every detail of it, with more awareness of all the emotions and human passions.<br />It's an intricate interpretation continuously mingled with creativity and perfume and colors. Am I delirious or is everybody else absurd?
B00005LQ04|5.0|Since I seem to be on an Italian horror kick, it's essential that I touch down on Dario Argento, and what better example than Suspiria.  In the much shunned subgenre of Italian horror, Dario Argento is one director who actually won the critics over a time or two.  You look on any top ten scary movie lists, you can bet Suspiria is on it.  This film isn't really frightening-in fact most people think it's stupid and/or corny- but it's certainly original.  The plot isn't much to brag about, this film is all about style.  I've always thought you could make a movie about anything and make it interesting if you presented it correctly.  Usually it's only the film snobs that pick up on the wild visual style Argento uses, but you certainly don't have to be a film snob to see it.  Alot of the people I suggest this to usually think it's boring and silly.  Granted these people aren't familiar with the genre and get scared to death by films like The House On Haunted Hill remake.  Sure, Suspiria has it's parts that  drag a bit, and the dubbing makes it sound corny(as usual), but all I can tell you is to view it with an open mind.  Go into it understanding that the Italians make horror films different from  American directors. And don't mistake different for dumb.  Argento's movies are pretty whacked out(in fact, he's pretty whacked out, check out his documentaries), and not all of them are masterpieces, but he's really got vision.  He's not a schlockmeister like his fellow countryman in Italian horror, Lucio Fulci(schlockmeister perhaps, but I love him to death), he's the kind of director that's likely to be studied in a film class.  He doesn't go for the all out gore attack like Fulci, but Argento's violence is certainly not for the squeamish.  The first murder scene in Suspiria is probably one of the most intense ever put on film.  I'll guarantee you everyone in the room will stop what they're doing to see it!  It may not have the Fulci gore, but it's got ten times more intensity.  I've rarely seen music used to such a great effect.  So, I'd definitely check this one out if you'd like to see Italian horror with an artsy edge.  In fact, you should see Suspiria just to say you've seen it.ensity.

0385504209|5.0|Robert Langdon fans, rejoice!  The hippest hero you'll EVER catch in a Harris tweed is back for another trans-European thrill ride. There are enough conspiracy theories, exotic locales, history lessons, white-knuckle escapes, double crosses, and last second twists to make this book simply impossible to put down.<br />While it is possible to read right through the book fairly quickly, the background material--such as the nature of the Holy Grail, Da Vinci's hidden codes, the religious symbology, and the early history of the Christian Church, to name just a handful--almost cry out for further study once the last page is turned.  That, I think, is one of this book's greatest strengths.  Readers who want to read this as a straight thriller will not be disappointed at all.  However, those who want to delve deeply into the mysteries of \\"The DaVinci Code\\" will find plenty of material to pore over.<br />This book is a spectacular, command, virtuoso performance by an author who knows how to educate while bringing readers to the edge of their seats.  BEG him to keep writing!
B00003CXN4|5.0|I loved this movie on several levels. First, and least important, any movie with Zeta Jones is good by definition, even if she's pregnant. Second, the screenplay is well written, tense, and keeps your attention. The Zeta's character develops from a blissfully ignorant stay at home mom to a take charge drug kingpin pro tem, in a fascinating way. Third and most important, the social issue.<br />The drug czars daughter develops a drug problem; her preppie boyfriend tells the drug czar \\"It is easier for a teenager to buy drugs than alcohol or cigarettes\\" Here, in this one phrase is the whole drug war conundrum, thesis, antithesis and synthesis, if you want dialectic materialism. The degradation of the African-American neighborhoods by the drug seeking adoloescents, the effect on the neighboring countries. How can any public officer remain honest, in the face of the amounts of money that the drug trade brings, and in addition, the alternative; silver or lead is the question, the answer is obvious.<br />The answer to the question of what to do, is hinted at, in the drug czar's speech, If there is a war on drugs, our children are the enemy, and I wont fight our children.<br />Watch this movie, it is worth it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I'm amazed at how many reviews comment on how unsuitable this film is for children, that kids at particular screenings had to actually leave the theatre. What is wrong with kids today? I, and my peers, grew up on the good stuff of the 80's. Movies were sometimes scary, and weird, but they were damn good. And how about that 'Jurassic Park' being marketed towards pre teens? That makes 'Spirited Away' look like an episode of 'Teletubbies', but we ate it up.<br />'Spirited Away' was one of the most lovely movies of 2002. It was one of the loveliest films I've seen, period.<br />This movie is too good to be hidden from your children. Just let them do what we did - we closed our eyes at the scary bits, and eventually learnt to watch them with our eyes open. We were having too much fun watching everything that came between. Turn off 'Blues Clues' and let them watch something good for a change.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I got Meteora the day it came out and it is the best CD ever. If you like Linkin Park, then this is a great followup to Hybrid Theory. <br />Great Songs include &quot;Numb&quot; which is the best song ever made by Linkin Park. All of the songs are good except for the stupid intro and &quot;Nobody's Listining&quot; . The instumental quality is fresh and exciting, and you will hear new sounds everytime you listin to Meteora. The Only dissapointment is that LP had 1 1/2 years to make this Cd and only Pumped out 12 tracks ( intro doesnt count ). The length of the CD is fine. Other people complain that the songs are short but the short songs are so damn good it really doesnt matter. Faint, From The Inside, Figure.09, and Lying From You are all &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;In the end&quot; caliber songs. <br />Overall, Meteora is a great CD to own. Listin to Numb and you will be stunned. Go buy it. <br />I've become so numb, i cant feel you there..........
B000084T18|5.0|50 cent is for the streets. ITs not his fault middle america, white suberbia is into it. He brings hip hop back to the streets. Have u listned to the first album that was cancled? or G-Unit 1-4? or the big mike mix tapes. The street doesn't expect the rest of america to understand it. Which is why you prolly dont understand it. And i too would go crazy if White Girls at a foot ball came kept yelling go shorty. But its bound to happen because 50 is popular.
B00001QEE7|4.0|This has always been a favorite movie of mine since childhood and I still love it as much as I did back in 1989 when it was in the theatres. It's truly a magical experience watching The Little Mermaid on DVD and both sound and picture quality is excellent. I just wish it had a good bunch of extras just like Beauty And The Beast had. (Another classic Disney movie!) I had The Little Mermaid in norwegian on video a few years ago but I played it so much it got worn out. Now I finally have it in top quality DVD format, but some scenes are a bit longer and scarier than on the norwegian video version I had. The scene towards the end where Ursula enlarges herself and creates a storm there is a bit where she shoots Ariel off a rock making her fall into the maelstrom that Ursula created with King Triton's fork. Ursula then tries to shoot Ariel but she manages to avoid being hit. Other longer scenes are Ariel and Flounder being chased by the shark in the shipwreck and Prince Eric discovering the dynamites onboard his ship just before it explodes. These small cuts were removed from the norwegian edition of the film, which I think is really stupid, cos they add that extra dramatic touch to it all. Overall, this is a fantastic movie with great animation, unforgettable characters and top class songs with \\"Part Of Your World\\" being my favorite, escpecially in the end where Ariel finally gets to marry Prince Eric. That whole scene just makes me cry and - don't laugh - I'm a 21 year old boy here...lol. However, I think this movie suits for people all ages, and it will always remain a true classic for years to come!
B00005QIPH|5.0|What can I say?  There are the nay-sayers who don't particularly care for this album too much, and then there are the fanatics who say this album is genius.  I am neither.  I just like what I heard. And I think The Strokes did an excellent job with this album. Nothing too out of the ordinary, nothing innovative, nothing bland either. It's just there. And while it may not be the masterpiece or the piece of trash that everyone thinks it is, this is definitely something.  <br />The vocals can be a little stressed at times, causing the lyrics to become a bit inaudible, but I really didn't care too much because the atmosphere of this album is so neat. It's kinda like hangin' out in a smoky bar on a Saturday night doing whatever, and I just got caught up in it.<br />An awesome album, not the best... not the worst. It's just awesome.<br />Best tracks (to me) are:<BR>1. Is This It (slow and deliberate, an overall great track)<BR>6. Alone, Together (the lead singer gets the job done on this track)<BR>7. Last Nite (a great Rock song)<BR>8. Hard To Explain (best song on the album)<BR>11. Take It Or Leave It (loud, 2nd best track on the album)<br />Basically, it's no the best nor the worst... but it is IT (if that helps).
B00008DDXC|5.0|Although we all loved the first movie in this series, this second movie has a tighter feel. The cast really pulls together and seems to find their niche in this film and the special effects, as always, are incredible.<br />If you haven't seen the first film or read the book,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone , I would advice seeing or reading it first. This second movie will make more sense if you know the background behind the characters and the game of Quiditch.
B00008MNYS|5.0|How exciting that Robbie Williams' work is finally getting a big push here in the US.<br />For those new to RW, this CD is just another great addition to an already impressive catalog of music that RW has built up in the last 6 years.  This is not, however, your traditional American pop music.  The lyrics are funny yet meaningful, the instrumentation and musical arrangements are original, and it's just an all-around GOOD album.<br />I was shocked (and pleased) when I heard &quot;Feel&quot; on the radio a few weeks ago, and hope that it (and a few other REALLY good songs on this album - Handsome Man, Something Beautiful, etc - succeeds in breaking RW into the American scene.<br />Also highly recommend Sing When You're Winning (one of my favorite 'pop' records ever) Life Through a Lens, and I've Been Expecting You (the latter two were condensed and released in the USA as &quot;The Ego Has Landed&quot;) .. great entertainer, and well worth the risk if you've never heard his music before.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning Western turns the genre entirely on its head. This west is a bleak moral vacuum, a place of anxious sized-obsessed men and violently determined women, where the creed of the cowboy gives way to the creed of the gangster. Villains aren't challenged to duels of skill, but slaughtered as they try to surrender. Virtually every man dies unarmed. The film could be enjoyed on a purely visceral level, but with its subplot about English Bob and his travelling 'biographer', screenwriter David Webb Peoples clearly has more in mind. His screenplay reflects on the Western as a myth-making genre, and suggests that the mythic conception of the American west is a fabrication woven from the exaggerated stories of braggarts and liars. His tale of Will Munny tells it like it probably was. It's a chilling world which has more in common with classical tragedy and the moral speculation of sci-fi. It's a world in which nobody wins, \\"we've all got it coming\\", and no one is forgiven.
B000008LOV|1.0|First the good: this album is a textbook lesson in studio production.  It sounds beautiful.  No surprise there - you would expect five multi-millionaires to be able to afford the best.<br />Now for the bad: this album has no imagination whatsoever.  Lyrics are shallow -- generally about picking up girls in bars.  Dylan sounds like he started with the rhymes and worked backwards.  Musically, nothing but the same tired old chord progressions and melodies.  The songs written by Harrison and Orbison are generally what they were writing 25+ years ago.<br />I'm sure this album sold a bunch when it first appeared -- when are music consumers going to start choosing creativity over packaging?

0064407667|4.0|Like many intelligent authors do, Snicket instigates a conflict in the story line of The Bad Beginning in its initial chapters. Although, this does not mean that Snicket is just like many intelligent authors because, unlike most authors, he chooses to conclude the book in such a way that no solution to the conflict, or shall I say conflicts come about. In fact, all that the story really even contains is conflicts, and troubles, and \\"unfortunate events\\" for the main characters, the Baudelaire children.<BR> It is terrible enough that Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire must try to cope with the bereavement of their loving parents. The charming Baudelaire children did not deserve any of the dreadful misfortunes that were to follow the first ill-fated event, a horrible fire that caused the death of their parents and destroyed the beautiful mansion that they called home. But to follow that event with another crisis, and another dilemma, and another difficulty, all equally horrible, makes for a very unfortunate life for the Baudelaire children. After the death of their parents, the children are forced to live with a distant relative, who, to say the least, is not a fan of children.<BR>Count Olaf, their only relative who lives close by, treats the amiable children extremely poorly and forces them to do demanding chores all day long. Though Violet is just fourteen, Klaus is just twelve, and Sunny is only an infant, Count Olaf makes them chop wood, repair windows, and even prepare a large supper for fourteen people while he is away at work. After being treated so badly, Violet and Klaus begin to realize that Count Olaf is more than just a terrible man; he is trying to steel the inheritance that Violet received from her parents, one that is not available to her until she is grown-up. The two older children, who are very intelligent for their age, must then find a way to stop the plan that the malevolent and sneaky Count has devised in order to get the money, and they must come up with a plan to save their young sister, who has been kidnapped, put into a cage, and hung from the top of a tall tower. Finally, just when things seem to be going the way the Baudelaire children would like, and just when the story seems to be ending on a happy note, more unfortunate events creep in.<BR> The Bad Beginning is an unforgettable book. Because of its nature, its unhappy beginning, middle, and ending, it stands out as one of a kind. Though it may seem that a book containing only terrible incidences would be one worth overlooking, Snicket disproves such a theory. The Bad Beginning is entertaining and comical, and can reach children at many levels.<BR>  To begin with, Snicket grasps the spirit of children by turning the narrator into a very likable storyteller, one who could actually be sitting with the readers on a rug, sharing his story and his thoughts. At different parts of the story the narrator stops to explain what a word means or pauses to warn the readers that the events that follow are not any happier than those which have already been told. This is one way that Snicket makes the readers feel that they are there where the story is taking place.<BR> Snicket also clutches the emotional side of children. Though the events that take place in the lives of the Baudelaire children are more horrible and outlandish than most children face, Snicket finds a way to share their emotions with the readers. The beginning of chapter two illustrates this very well. The narrator says, \\"It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the time that followed. If you have ever lost someone very important to you, then you already know how it feels, and if you haven't, you cannot possibly imagine it...\\" When children can relate emotionally to characters in a story, the story becomes powerful and moving. Children can learn and grow just by relating real life experiences to those in a book. It seems that Snicket is aware of this fact.<BR> Finally, a book that only contains unfortunate events could teach children a great deal about life. How often do children think that their own lives are so much worse than their friends or relatives? As soon as they get to know Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire it is likely that they will realize their lives are not so bad after all. For once, children that are unappreciative might even become grateful for the fortunate lives that they have.

B00000DNCF|5.0|this cd is the same version as the regular badmotorfinger with one xception. it comes with an extra cd called somms that has only five songs. one of which is a live version of slaves-n-bulldozers. the other four are covers. into the void, by black sabath song while stray cat blues is a rolling stones song. there are two other songs girl u want by devo and she's a politician by chris cornell.  all 5 are good songs and make this a worthwhile additon to any soundgarden fan's collection.     all of the above mentioned songs are live. the production is good, for a live album. the songs are interestingly done and this cd is a intersting find.       as for badmotorfinger, as an album, it is one of the many  great releases from soundgarden.  we all know rusty cage and outshined but there is so much better music here such as songs that let ben shepard and his groove drenched bass playing shine.  i am speaking of slaves -n- bulldozers.  what a great song.  chris cornell penns some great lyrics through the whole album.  most notably here and the song somewhere.  what a melody (both in lyrics and music), what great lyrics and what a great song all around.       one most also note monster drummer extraordinaire matt cameron who pulls out some great beats(its all about the beat, drop a phat one and repeat)and fills, most notably on jesus christ pose.  just listen to the drums.  amazing.         there are other great songs such as searching with my good eye closed, mind riot and drawing flies.  it is on drawing flies and mind riot that soundgarden show their punkier side, busting out the songs with the spirit of a band possessed.  this is one good album and the bonus somms cd makes this worht your time and money.
B00008AY3L|4.0|To begin I will address the need that everybody is crying about. The protection label was an accident by Virgin. It has been addressed on the website..and you can return it for one that isn't protected. Don't be so hasty when blaming Ben Harper for something the record company does because you have to remember that it is not Ben making these discs by hand but little machines and Chinese children getting paid slave labor to make your precious music listenable.<BR>The disc itself is reasonably solid showcasing Ben's efforts to expand his horizons now that he has a solid backing band. I'm still one that enjoys him live instead of on a disc but it's always worthwhile to hear his efforts in the studio also. The only disappointment I have is with the \\"With My Own Two Hands\\" which I have to admit is biased from the Bonnaroo performance he gave which is a hard performance to top. It's always good to see a performer moving forward rather than staying stale and selling what got them there.<BR>Sidenote: Even though \\"Fight For Your Right\\" is my favorite Ben Harper album you'd be hardpressed to find quaint nuances in all his albums.
B000002GK1|4.0|soundgarden are one of the pinnacle bands of the nineties and this album is one amazing trip.  an album that is one of the heaviest, noisy gems to sludge its way out of seattle.  part sabbath and part zepplin lead to amazing riffs from my least favorite soundgarden member in kim thayil.  matt cameron, now in pearl jam,  is always a monster drummer especially on songs like jesus christ pose.  just listen to the drums.  amazing. ben shepard is one amazing grooving bass player.  songs like slaves and bulldozers and room 1,000 years wide are where he shines (and two of my favorite songs)<br />  chris cornell's voice is an instrument and he pushes his voice to the limit, sometimes screaming and wailing while other times holding back to let the music do the talking.  there are many influences here from metal (in songs like searching with my good eye closed) and punk (in songs like face pollution and drawing flies) the music is complex and can be epic or can be simple.  we all know songs like outshined and rusty cage but there is so much more to this album.  soundgarden were unique and this album is diverse and briliant.  words never truly cpature the greatness.  some albums must be felt in order to experience the greatness.  this is such an album.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stipes' last album, White Blood Cells, was one of the most critically aclaimed albums of the past year.  It was not their best album, but it was their first album that gained any exposure.  It was quirky and odd with a lot of fantastic tracks, and then a couple that just seemed a little too far out there. Enter Elephant, a much more conventional rock album that is sure to draw even more comparisons to Led Zeppelin than ever before.<br />Many people felt that with the White Stripes new found success, they were doomed to become a commercial act.  After all, what could be more commercial than always wearing red and white a charade about being brother and sister instead of ex husband and wife.  But their commercial  overtones stop there.  This album combines the greatest aspects from White Blood Cells, while bringing back the blues/slide guitar that made DeStijl a classic.  The result is absolutely magnificent.  The Stripes finally experiment a bit with bass, although many long for the day when they pull in a full time bass player to complete a potentially phenomenal band.  But perhaps the simplicity is the beauty of the White Stripes.  <br />Besides the addition of bass, Meg White actually steps out from behind the drums and sings over the bluesy &quot;Cold, Cold Night.&quot;  Her eerie, out of key voice is a beautiful compliment to the subtle bass.  Other excellent tracks include Seven Nation Army, Black Math, and the mindblowing There's No Home For You Now.  The Stripes even dip into the role of &quot;cover band&quot; on &quot;I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself&quot; and &quot;I Want to be the Boy.&quot;  Both are pulled off exceptionally well.  &quot;Hypnotise&quot; sounds eerily similar to &quot;Fell In Love With a Girl&quot; but that's forgivable and by no means takes away from a nearly flawless album.<br />Does Elephant have any flaws?  You'd be hard pressed to find them.  The absence of bass for the majority of the album will probably scare awaya few new fans, but to old fans of the Stripes, they wouldn't have it any other way.
B000002GJH|5.0|the death of lead singer andrew wood from the seminal seattle band mother love bone hit alot of people hard.  the result of the loss and pain was this stuningly emotional album from soundgarden singer chris cornell (who was andy's roommate) and drummer matt cameron uniting with surviving members of mother love bone (and future members of pearl jam) stone gossard and jeff ament(who worked with andrew wood).  also appearing is future lead singer eddie vedder (also a future pearl jam member) <BR>     this album has echoes of pearl jam/MLB/green river/soundgarden (or to put it briefly, seattle grunge) but never truly sound exactly like any of them.  it sounds like itself.  this was a unique one album tribute that just stirs the heart and soul.    <BR>     of course hunger strike was a radio hit but what was never released were the true gems such as the eleven minute reach down with its amazing jam in toward the end.  the amazing sounds of four walled world.  the sounds that guitar makes on that song are just frighteningly amazing.  say hello to heaven and pushin forward back are amazing rock songs full of great emotion and wonderful music that just bleeds for you.  <BR>     this is a very emotional album that just sours with emotion and great music and is a major album worthy of notice.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is definitely one of the best I've seen in a long time, and I have to take issue with R.P. McCosker's review.  How can this movie \\"go to show the decline of our culture,\\" yet Legally Blonde is \\"Good Silly Fun?\\"  I prefer to think of the success of a movie like Moulin Rouge as more of an indicator of a culture that can appreciate art.<br />Everything about this movie, from costume design, to set design, to music and dialog comes together in a truly awe-inspiring display.  It's worth watching more than once (if just to catch the little things most will miss the first time through), and the music will be stuck in your head long after the movie ends.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor should be applauded for being brave enough to take on a project like this.  While I won't expect to see either actor leave Hollywood in pursuit of a music career, I was surprised to hear how good they really are.  The use of their own voices for the singing parts helps to keep the story cohesive, and allows for a seamless transition from song to spoken word that couldn't be done with a voice double.<br />The choice of songs was outstanding, with representations from many different musical genres and eras.  It's not often you can put Smells Like Teen Spirit, Like a Virgin, Your Song, and Come What May together and get something so fluid.  Not only did the songs serve to bring the decadent, 19th century bohemian movement into modern times, as well as truly further the story, but I found myself more fully understanding the same songs I'd been hearing for years, yet never really listened to.  I'll never again hear Your Song or Roxanne the same way again.<br />The editing was excellent, and the sometimes manic cuts from shot to shot within a scene (like the opening Can Can scene, or the final production scene), or between two scenes happening simultaneously (the Roxanne scene) gave a heightened sense of emotion, and let the audience feel a little of the excitement that the characters would have felt.<br />This isn't a movie for the attention-deficit crowd, and it isn't a movie for people that like 2-hour rock videos.  This is a movie for anyone that enjoys art, music, and love.

B000063JDE|4.0|This 1986 film, written and directed by David Lynch, is a real shocker.  It takes a small town mystery and turns it into a film noir.  The images are violent and sadistic.  The story is weak.  And the plot confused.  At the end, I still wasn't sure what happened. And yet, it had a fascination to it and I just couldn't stop watching.<br />There's young Kyle MacLachlan, newly home from college, who finds a severed ear in the woods.  There's Laura Dern as his blonde and blue-eyed girlfriend whose father is a cop.  There's Isabella Rossellini as a sultry nightclub singer with secrets galore.  And then there is Dennis Hopper as and cruel sicko who abuses Rossellini.  The acting is fine.  And the story kept me interested.  And yet it let me down.  Because by the time I watched it all the way through I still wasn't sure of the plot.<br />Rather, I came away with a feeling.  One that haunted my dreams last night.  It's isn't pleasant.  But it goes to show just how far a director can go in films.  And David Lynch sure did break boundaries in this one.  By the end of the film I felt I was myself a victim of his violence against the audience.  But, in spite of all its faults I rather liked it simply for its outrageousness and willingness to break boundaries.  Recommended only for the brave few.
B00005JLSC|5.0|words can't describe how much fun I had watching this , I never liked the stage play found it too ummm dark I suppose you could say but the movie is a blast! 5/5!
B00008AWOD|4.0|Placebo have never been a band for major changes of direction, but Sleeping With Ghosts sees them consolidating strengths across the board and venturing into new, electronica-influenced territory. First single `Bitter End' is classic Placebo, recalling the punky immediacy of their first album, yet simultaneously mixing in some spooky piano and swirling harmonies that deepen the sound a bit. Opening instrumental `Bulletproof Cupid' and `Second Sight' both also follow the same tack, blistering along and ripping everything in their path to shreds.<br />Meanwhile, there's something new afoot on `English Summer Rain', which schizophrenically leaps between a chorus that showcases a lush, rhythmic keyboard effect, a sleazy verse with almost funk-style bass and Molko dirtily beckoning `I'm in the basement baby - drop on by', before entering an ending section that is scarily resemblent of Linkin Park, with its chant of `Hold your breath and count to ten/Fall apart then start again' and a synth that sounds right out of `In The End' or `Crawling'. It should be horrific, but somehow they pull it off.<br />They've still got the power to be emotionally devastating, too. The acoustic-led title track is as beautiful and heartbreaking as anything they've ever done, right up there with `Without You I'm Nothing' and `Peeping Tom', yet its building sound and electronica drums and synths make it ever more wonderful that those two tracks, as Molko calls `soulmate dry your eyes' in a moment where his vocals leave behind their sneer and just float over the canvas that his bandmates weave. Lyrically, it's a high point - along with `Protect Me From What I Want', their third political lyric (`corporate America wakes/Coffee Republic in case') after trying the tactic on `Spite and Malice' and `Haemoglobin' off their last album.<br />Meanwhile `This Picture' and `Special Needs' see them create two of the best songs of their career. The former opens as urban cool, before exploding into a soaring,major-chord chorus with a bleeping arpeggio synth and a killer tune. The latter, too begins unremarkably, but when it explodes, it goes into a soundscape quite unlike anything before it, and its one to die for.<br />It doesn't all quite work. `Something Rotten' attempts to experiment and create a disturbing, difficult, jagged track to reflect its lyric on abuse, but comes across simply as an unlistenable mess; while `I'll Be Yours' just smacks of filler, evoking emotions that have been brought out better a million times before, not least by Placebo themselves. Final track `Centrefolds' too, is something of a letdown, perfectly passable but not the emotional climax that we've come to expect from a Placebo closer, and `Plasticine' is something of Placebo-by-numbers. Overall, though, its another winning album, which broadens out Placebo's sound and justifies their places in our hearts for a good while yet.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I love musicals adore them infact , wanted to love this , IT IS NOT A MUSICAL ! its a bunch of poor old pop songs masking themselfs as classic musical songs. Nicole has an awful voice , Ewan can sing shame he had to land himself in such an awful movie.
B00007ELEL|5.0|This movie is simply hillarious.  The Coen brothers have a very intelligent, dark, offbeat sense of humor that might not appeal to everyone, however it appeals to many people, and this is a classic Coen movie.  It's a great story with a dialogue filled with lines you and your friends will be quoting left and right.  Don't pass up on this gem.
B00008RH3L|5.0|This is one of my favourite movies. Like other reviewers, I have been keenly awaiting this DVD release. This powerful gangster movie is brilliantly filmed and acted with Gabriel Byrne and John Turturro putting in the performances of their respective careers. The movie builds suspense and contains snappy dialogue and great one-liners. Enjoy!
B000069CWE|5.0|I think this cd is great for the game of innovation and creativeness.  You take some of great rock producers and stick them with todays hottest underground hip-hop artists.  Why didn't anyone think of this before?  You get the best of both worlds in one cd.  No remix cd is as great as the original but this is the best one to date and probably will be for a long time.
B00007AJGH|5.0|It seems difficult to believe that this movie came out in 1988.  As I watched the new Vista Series release, one part of me kept thinking computer graphics, but I knew that there were no digital computer effects in this movie.  All the effects that you see are a combination of animation and physical special effects.  However, you do not need to know that there were no computer effects in this movie to enjoy it.<br />The story:  Roger Rabbit was framed for the murder of Marvin Acme, played by Stubby Kaye.  Bob Hoskins, playing gumshoe Eddie Valiant, finds that he has been suckered into being part of setting poor Roger up to take the fall.  Sounds like film noire, and in fact it is, with one tiny twist; Roger Rabbit and many of the characters in this movie are \\"Toons\\", short for cartoons, of course.  What follows is a twist on the detective movies of the 30s and 40s, only with everything larger than life and with a good dose of humor.<br />The animation in this movie is nothing short of fantastic.  The special effects used to simulate the interaction of the cartoon characters and the human actors are so seamless that eventually you accept that the cartoon characters are \\"real\\".  The animation was so good that the movie won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1988, along with several other Academy Awards.<br />One fascinating feature of the animated characters is the appearance by characters from multiple studios.  Though Touchstone Pictures, a division of Disney, made this film, there are Warner Brothers characters, Woody Woodpecker, Betty Boop, Droopy Dog and a host of Disney characters from Dumbo to Donald Duck.  Such inter-studio cooperation is unusual, but works extremely well for this movie, making the movie much more believable and enjoyable.<br />The combination of film noire, animation and humor in the movie make the movie suitable for adults and children.  However, some scenes are somewhat intense, garnering the movie a PG rating, so parents should consider whether the movie is suitable for the youngest members of the family.<br />While I could spend more time on the movie itself, I think the movie speaks for itself.  It was highly lauded by a number of critics when it came out, and the movie did very well at the box office and in release on video.  Instead, I'd rather focus on the features of the Vista Series release.<br />This release contains two DVDs, with more features and extras than I was aware existed.  The two DVD's contain three animated shorts that were made after the success of \\"Who Made Roger Rabbit\\".  There are commentaries, pictures, and several features related to how portions of the movie were filmed.  One of the most interesting features show comparisons between Bob Hoskins and his actions against a blue screen in comparison to how the final scenes came out.  Another interesting feature shows how plastic dolls were used to aid in setting up shots.  A deleted scene with Bob Hoskins in a pig's head is also included, along with the reasons the scene was deleted.  One of the complaints regarding the previous releases has been that there was this wealth of material available, but not available on a video release.  I think much of the material regarding how this movie was made and the trivia associated with it is included in this DVD.  I spent several hours going through the material and I'm not sure that I've seen it all yet.<br />I only have one small complaint regarding all this material.  The material was not well-organized and I had a hard time finding specific features, and found myself jumping from screen to screen to find everything.  In fact, I'm not sure I've found it all yet.  Of course, that also means you get the thrill of discovery each time you find a feature listed on the box that you struggled to find in the first place.<br />For the aficionado of \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" that has sought more information about the movie than was previously available, your version of this DVD is here.  The movie itself is just as fresh and amazing today as it was in 1988.  The extras are numerous and are nearly worth the price of the DVD by themselves.  Five stars for a film that will likely continue to amaze audiences for decades to come..  The movie itself is just as fresh and amazing today as it was in 1988.

B000002WAD|3.0|I remember when I saw my first Astley video, I was blown away that such a soulful baritone could come from a red-headed lad from the British Isles.  This, his first album, was on my must-have list.<br /><br />Almost two decades later, fond memories flood the mind as I listen to the selections that were to be his hits: the title cut, \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\", \\"Together Forever\\", and \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\".  However, in hindsight, I think the singer was superior to the standard dance pop with which he was saddled.<br /><br />He does rise to the occasion with a surprisingly good remake of the Nat King Cole classic \\"When I Fall in Love\\".  This cut rounds out the album and suggests that Astley should have considered more songs of this caliber that may have lengthened his \\"shelf life\\".
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I loved this movie!!  I am a huge Jane Austen fan and this movie perfectly captured her ability to show the inner turmoil of her characters through thier unspoken emotions.  The last couple of scenes take my breath away every time I see it and those leading up to the climax make me yell at my TV each time.  The cast is great and the costumes and scenes are wonderful.  I highly reccomend this film to Austen lovers and anyone else who adores British flims.  A great movie!
B000004286|5.0|This CD is very nice. I have wanted it for so long and have put off buying it until yesterday. I bought it and loved it! I love every track, especially &quot;A Gift of A Thistle.&quot; This CD has many Celtic or Gealic sounds, which are very beautiful. It's a very soothing CD for the most part with some tunes with more action than others. I highly reccommend this CD to anyone who liked the movie.

6305081751|5.0|It's a good tear jerker at the end.  It brings about life's realities such as family problems. How Rocky has a positive attitude towards his disease and death. Rocky is so misjudged due to his appearance until people look at the inside and not just the outside of him. He has compassion for people and is not a quitter.  He keeps going to the end.  I highly recommend this movie to all.  It's something you just have to see.
0671027344|3.0|I just finished reading this book for my honors English class at school after nine days. In its defense, I will say that I actually could identify with at least half the things that happened to Charlie. After all, the period of Charlie's life in which the book takes place is the period of my life I am going through this very moment. In its defense, I will say that while the characters are rather one-sided, Patrick and Sam seem like the kind of kids I would like to have for friends. Against it, however, I will say that, as other reviewers have pointed out, Charlie is a very unrealistic character. In my own life I am often a wallflower, but I don't cry every time I get sentimental or upset. Teenagers don't cry, they say \\"GOD ...!!\\" and kick a chair across the room. I agree with the other reviewers that Chbosky keeps trying to present Charlie as a sensitive, noble, gifted person, when in fact he is nothing more than a whiny teen with severe mental problems. His naivete is annoying because it's more like an eight-year-old than a sixteen-year-old. But again, in its defense, I will argue against what the negative reviewers say about the writing style. Pay attention to the letters you write and you will see that people, even in real life, never WRITE the way they TALK. I sure as hell don't. I write the way I THINK, and that's quite different from the way I talk. Do people SAY \\"You are cordially invited\\"? No, that's the formality of writing a letter. Think these things through before you write them. At any rate, I can't say I enjoyed \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\". It was too long, there was little point to it and the last 20 pages or so were quite disturbing. But some of it was still pretty enjoyable reading, so I conclude that \\"The Perks Of Being a Wallflower\\" is a good, if by no means excellent, book.

0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton recaptures his earlier ability to scare the hell out of you with the rather intricately woven, \\"Prey.\\"<br />Jack Foreman is a software designer and designer team leader who blew the whistle on his old boss only to get fired, blackballed and currently severely unemployed. So with a totally unexpected result, he takes over the Foreman child rearing duties and becomes a \\"Mr.Mom\\" with an attitude.<br />The biggest problem he has is his wife, also a gifted software designer, who has recently become inattentive, ornery, flash fire tempered and guilty of unexplained absences. He begins to think that her research in artificial intelligence (AI) and as the moving force behind a 'next stage' of nanoparticles that can think themselves into an airborne camera for government snooping may be, well, more than meets the eye.<br />Jack gets a chance to consult with his wife's new company and arrives to see that the nanoparticles his wife has assembled, smaller than a human cell, truly have a mind of their own. Further, that they are regenerating at an alarming rate, that they are \\"learning\\" from the errors of prior generations, that they have escaped out of the company facility onto the Nevada countryside, and that they are beginning to kill animals of increasing size.<br />Too miniscule for the naked eye, able to slip through the cells of the human body, en masse they are able to 'chameleon' themselves into taking human form. Once in the facility, Jack realizes that the nanoparticles are now trying to get back into the facility with the intention of wiping the inhabitants out.<br />Kind of a mixture of \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Andromeda Strain,\\" with a touch of Stephen King's \\"Cujo.\\" Not terribly in depth development of the characters, a constant criticism of a lot of Crichton's heroes and anti-heroes, yet offset by good scare tactics and an above average storyline.<br />Readers who long for the old Crichton and earlier stories won't be disappointed.
630587493X|5.0|This is not your typical SF film, ala &quot;Star Wars&quot;.  With &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;, Robin Williams has created a delightful and moving fable of the human condition.  This is my favorite film of 1997, and possibly of many other years as well.  Kudos to director Chris Columbus, and actors Sam Neil and Elizabeth Davidtz, as well. Splendid performances are turned in by the entire company.  I love these folks for giving the world this sensitive and intelligent enactment. <br />The film's special effects are very impressive.  The DVD is stunning in 16:9 widescreen mode.  The musical sound track augments the story perfectly, is well balanced with the dialog, and sounds luscious in surround mode.  In short, this is a nearly perfect presentation of a marvelous movie. This one is not to be missed.
B00008CLOA|5.0|....even if you *can't* access the surround-sound mix! I won't bother reviewing the album itself---we know already that Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; is an immortal rock masterpiece. The big question about this special 30th Anniversary Edition is, is it worth getting, especially if you've already shelled out money for the original CD version, the Mobile Fidelity gold CD version, AND the 20th Anniversary Edition from 10 years ago? Could this landmark album be worth buying yet again? The answer is a resounding *YES*! The funny thing is, I don't even own a proper home theater system, so I can't play the special surround-sound mix, only the regular stereo mix. And that alone has totally blown me away. Believe me, you've NEVER heard &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; sound this good. This 30th Aniversary Edition of &quot;Dark Side&quot; is a complete package all the way around. The new, updated prism cover art by Storm Thorgerson &amp; Peter Curzon is very colorful &amp; cool to look at, and the new CD booklet, 30 pages long with 30 assorted photographs, gives an excellent history of the &quot;Dark Side&quot; album itself (I never knew that the Russians got a slightly different album cover than the rest of the world). The CD itself is gold-colored, which, before you even play it, is already a good sign of the new-and-improved sound quality. I played this new &quot;Dark Side&quot; back-to-back with the older 20th Anniversary version, and yes indeed, this new &quot;Dark Side&quot; CD definitely sounds better---bigger boom, stronger sonics &amp; clarity, and the bass has more bottom to it (you can totally *feel* that opening heartbeat, to name one example). The band literally ROAR out of the speakers. The instruments, the vocals, the taped speaking voices and sound effects sound even clearer &amp; sharper than ever before. You can definitely hear notes &amp; other bits that weren't previously detected. The bottom line: the sound quality on this new &quot;Dark Side&quot; CD is just plain astonishing. My compliments to Doug Sax &amp; James Guthrie for an outstanding remastering job.I'm sure we can expect another CD upgrade of this classic album in 2013, when &quot;Dark Side&quot; turns 40. Until then, you owe it to yourself to pick up this 30th Anniversary Edition, and hear &quot;Dark Side&quot; as you've never heard it before, even if you don't own a home theater system. The fabulous new stereo mix alone, along with the impressive new packaging, makes this purchase a total keeper. Let's face it---you can *never* have too many copies of Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon.&quot;
B00006AW2M|3.0|This has got to be the most blatantly dishonest album by the Stones in their prime.  It's just too obvious that they were trying to find a new niche for themselves, and it fails as badly as their attempt at joining in with the Woodstock thing at Altamont.  Nonetheless, there's some good music:  \\"Citadel,\\" \\"2000 Light Years,\\" \\"She's A Rainbow\\" which they probably should have combined with some of the gems they brought out as singles during this time:  \\"We Love You,\\" \\"Dandelion,\\" etc. and gotten rid of the asinine \\"Why Don't We Sing This Song All Together\\" (because it's stupid maybe?) ....
B000002LD2|5.0|Wow!!  This album refutes all those critics who claim that the sound of the Mary Chain never changed...and this was only their second album.  Following the sucess of their first(and sadly most sucessful) album, the Mary Chain stripped away the fuzz, distortion, and feed back, to create this haunting and beatiful album.  Dark (as the title implies) though with some light moments, this album is slightly reminiscent of the gothic Cure while remaining pure Mary Chain.  This album is the clean cousin of Pshchocandy--a mirror image and yet different and as inspiring as any of the Mary Chain's great records.  If you liked Psychocandy or any of their other albums buy this one, its one of their best.  All the songs are good but my faves are Darklands (about suicide) Happy When it Rains (I relate to this song alot) April Skies (sad, haunting song) and Cherry Came Too (Cherry Takes me to the place above with Barbed Wire Kisses and her love...)love the lyrics to that last song.  In short, while not as influential as Psychocandy, this album is actually better musically, and a great album to listen to when you are down.  Haunting, beatiful, crucial.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Some of the most revealing footage in this fantastic collection appears in Volume 8. Never before had I realized the extent to which Paul's surge of creativity in 68 and 69 put John ill at ease. Two monster hits (&quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Let it Be&quot;), are performed -- and just watch John as he plays on these tracks. Except for the last 3rd of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; it's obvious that John feels like he has nothing to do on these songs -- he's like a backup musician and he's just buzzing with hidden jealousy because Paul has the spotlight. And boy does Paul have the spotlight -- half of these songs are just Paul in close-up singing directly to the camera, while John strums his guitar offscreen (&quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; is an even more extreme example). And then -- bam! -- John is in bed with Yoko campaigning for world peace or posing naked on the &quot;Two Virgins&quot;  cover and so on and so forth. It's like he's trying to grab the attention back which Paul has stolen. Now, I personally think John was doing better work than Paul right up to  the end (i.e. &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;). But as anyone who has followed the Beatles knows, John was as obsessed as anybody with who had the Number One hit, who had the &quot;A&quot; side of the single, and so on. Watching Volume 8 I could really see John just smoldering with resentment. It's a glimpse into a very human and not very noble side of someone who remains one of my great heroes. It was fascinating.
B00005YW4H|5.0|After reading some of the other reviews about Norah Jones, and her album, I am thoroughly convinced there are people out there who have absolutely no clue what they are talking about.  If you are going to write a review about someone and their album, try being OBJECTIVE!  Norah Jones and her songs are a breath of fresh air, and a nice change of pace from the same old typical music you hear on the radio these days.  Granted, you may not like her voice as she does have a slight breathy quality about her, but many people said the same thing about Louis Armstrong, and he was and still is considered a legend to many in the jazz community.  The truth is, unless you happen to like jazz, you may not like this album.  But to me, Norah Jones is deserving of all the Grammys and popularity she is receiving.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|now, having seen the 'film pf the year' slogan at the top of the ad for this movie, i was expecting something pretty decent.<br />EVERYTHING about this movie was pointless....the story, the writing, and the characters were all so 2 dimensional it was beyond a joke....<br />the guy who wrote this film must have seen either Jacobs ladder or 6th sense and thought ' hey , i can do this'.....<br />this film was just annoying, it went from scene to scene pointlessly, almost randomly.....as soon as i saw the beginning i knew it would be a 'twist in the end' type story.....<br />Jacobs Ladder is a masterpiece of cinema, and so is the 6th sense....<br />this on the other hand, is like giving a camera and a pen to a bunch of film students and asking them to create a clone of the films i mentioned.<br />its like creating art without the 'artist'.....<br />if watching 90 mins of illogical, boring dialogue, badly acted scenes, disjointed film making is your idea of quality, you will love this.<br />best avoided by everyone else who doesnt feel the need to sit through such dire filmaking<br />in fact NO dont avoid it - WATCH IT - i want others to suffer too !!<br />i have seen some poor movies in my time, but what amazes me the most here is the sheer contrast of the 'excellent reviews' and whats actually on offer..<br />did these people actually watch it ?<br />you know a film is poor when the makers just overlap dull scenes with almost full length pop songs !<br />i found it akin to someone playing the theme to Rocky over a tranquil landscape - it doesnt work, 'it doesnt go'.<br />'mini masterpiece' ?<br />my backside. at best a time filling sunday afternoon TV movie for pensioners.<br />was this review too harsh ? watch it then decide.<br />Boogs.
0385484518|4.0|The book is great and I recommend it to anyone whose anyone. After reading this book, I actually stopped and listened to Morrie's wise words. It's funny because I am taking adviced from a character in a book. I hope everyone who reads it and enjoys it as much as I did. Read the book, Morrie explains that every person in the world should live life to the fullest. You'll never know when something decides to cut it short.
0780020693|4.0|This is not a coherent or particularly complex portrait of fascism, as some would have you believe.  It's a collection of childhood memories that TOUCH on and occasionally illustrate aspects of fascism.<br />It's a clever idea for a movie; others had made similar films, but this one takes it &quot;all the way&quot; into being a disconnected series of memories, dream-like.  Woody Allen's &quot;Radio Days&quot; and Spike Lee's &quot;Crooklyn&quot; would be two later films, both quite good, that follow a similar path.  <br />In places, the film is absolutely brilliant.  For me, the series of scenes that show the boys jerking around in school and wasting their days are extremely briliant, subtle, and effective.

B00005JLK1|2.0|Unfortunately this film never lives up to it's over the top but rather cool introduction scene. <BR>Produced by the same people who did House on Haunted Hill and 13 Ghosts it continues in the same style but never reaches the creepiness and makes both these films look far superior.<BR>Tediously predictable, the plot and scripting are aweful and Gabriel Byrne's wooden seafaring acting is testing. Sure, these films succeed in their ability to scare through special effects but it also falls short in this respect too. <BR>It seesm to end too abruptly. Just as you think it's about to come to life, it winds down...possibly a blessing though.<BR>Avoid.
B00008MNYS|4.0|For whatever reason, success in the States has eluded Robbie Williams, despite being Europe's biggest pop star for the last 3 or 4 years. Having recently signed a $90M contract with his new label, Virgin, Williams was apparently assured that the company would put its full resources into helping him achieving equal commercial stature in the US. Chances are his profile will increase here, but unfortunately he has dropped what is, by his standards, only a good-to-mediocre release. &quot;Feel&quot;, the first single, is a great song; catchy and melodic with introspection that normal people can relate to. There are other standouts cuts; &quot;Revolution&quot; has hit potential, but most of the songs here pale next to Williams' previous efforts. Now, I'm just a guy who likes music and far be it for me to question record company decisions, but I was dumb-founded to find that for the US release, the best song from the original disc - &quot;Hot Fudge&quot; -was dropped. While Escapology doesn't live up to high expectations, it is, balanced against other popular music, a good and worthwhile CD to add to the collection. You may, however, have difficulty appreciating what the hype is all about. In that case, pick up his first US release, &quot;The Ego has Landed&quot; and you'll understand what you've been missing.
B00008J4P5|3.0|this is another good release from the white stripes but there isn't much here that we haven't already heard before. some of the songs sound like alternate versions or b-sides from white blood cells.  again this is a good release well worth picking up, but with the exception of a few tracks, you wont hear anything you haven't heard before.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|What an incredible movie.  A great movie that I can't stop raving about to my friends. Granted - every movie has flaws - but this movie comes darn close to flawless.  In my book - it's the king of &quot;psychological thrillers&quot;. Once again - a MUST HAVE for anyone's collection. Believe the reviews - this movie is so fresh and entertaining. A twisty plot, a great cast, and a killer soundtrack make for an excellent film. <BR>Hands down - 5 stars.
B00005R24K|4.0|This is truly one of the most frightening horror films of all time; especially for the time in which it was created.  However, due to a limited budget, you will not find Academy Award winning acting in The Evil Dead, nor will you find the greatest special effects.  Despite what I have heard about other studios' releases of this film, I found this DVD in particular (Anchor Bay version) to be quite nice.  Alas, I was somewhat disappointed when I discovered that it was not fullscreen.  On the contrary, the THX digital mastering is absolutely magnificent.  There are also some special features which I found entertaining as well.  This is definitely Sam Raimi's greatest accomplishment, and is a must-have for any horror fanatic, or just anyone who wants to be scared out of their wits!
B00008MNYS|5.0|The biggest selling album in Europe has finally been released in your beautiful country.  You also have the added bonus of two superb new tracks, 'One Fine Day' and 'Get A Little High'. If you don't instantly like songs such as 'Feel', 'Monsoon', 'Come Undone' and 'Love Somebody' then your taste in music is questionable. This one album justifies EMI's decision to pay Robbie $126.1m. Lie back, listen and fall in love with the musical sensation that is Robbie Williams!
B000089A07|1.0|As another viewer put it: your like of Red Dragon will hinge on whether you've seen the original entitled Manhunter. Have been a great fan of the Lector series for some time now I will be to the point. Edward Norton was absolutly the worst actor to pick for the movie. His protrayl of Investigator Graham seems too young and too clean. He doesn't convey the senese of a seasoned FBI profiler with deamons haunting him. Anthony Hopkins is not given enough time to shine and is badly distorted. Lector is suave and calm. However in Red Dragon his portrayal is more like a drunken, social outcast. In the beginning when we see how Lector is caught, that is the ONLY time we see of who Lector really is. Emily Watson plays Reba as a sex/socially deprived woman who'll open her life up to anyone who says more than two words. Absolutly the wrong protrayal of the book character who was poised, professional, and confident. Harvey Keitel's portrayal of Grahams boss, Jack Crawford, is good but if your not careful you might think of him as Grahams father. Philip Seymour Hoffman cannot act and was an obvious mistake for this part. The only satisfaction from his character is seeing his fate. Last but not least is Ralph Fiennes. Granted he plays the serial killer Dolarhyde as best as he can but he lacks the ability to scare us. The average person would not be afraid of running into Mr. Fiennes at the grocery store but Manhunter's Dollarhyde (played by the brillant Tom Noonan) would give anybody the creeps.<br />Finally the movies script lacks heavily in it's linking of the different chracters and plots. You sometimes get the feeling it was produced by a highschool creative writing class, not a professonal screenwriter. In an effort to get every last iota of detail from the book into the movie we are deeply left out in the cold by the trival portrayal of climatic scenes, important moments, and the critical PIVITOL moment of the entire movie. I was deeply dissapointed. Manhunter draws you inand you move with the characters. You feel apart of them and when you reach the movies grand climax,  you are overwhelmed with that same awe and power as the characters. Red Dragon however lets this pass as though it were as stoplight changing at a busy intersection.<br />All in all I did not like the movie. Greg Finnes gives a good performance and worth comending. Dollarhydes book description (and in Manhunter) is excellent, yet this portrayl seems to lack that underlinning fear that we expect from an insane serial killer. This movie is more akin to a novice director, a slap-shot cast with little acting ability, less time to perfect their parts, and overall a bad movie to waste your money on. Despite the low budget and relatively unknown cast of Manhunter, it succeeds in drawing you in, exciting the imagination, and giving us the creeps as trillers SHOULD.<br />Bottom line: If you like serious, well acted, movies that don't insult your intelligence and leave you hanging, see Manhunter. However if you want a cheap thriller for a party, see Red Dragon.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|I found this album to be the perfect \\"driving through a long lonely highway\\" soundtrack. As surreal as any Dali painting, Cooders eerie playing provokes daydreams of the stereotypical American southwest.....dust, sheriffs, injuns, guns, coyotes & cacti.....Then simultaniously, it twists & implodes- displaying Galban, to portray the pastel charm and quaint nature of a mid- fifties to sixties mambo lounge. Ironic, witty, haunting and beautiful. I recommend it to anyone who wants to escape to another reality altogether. For the perfect romantic. Truly enlightening.
0451197879|3.0|I have read several Stephen King books, and I have become very fond of his work. Roadwork is written by King's alternate personality, Richard Bachman. This is the first book that I've read when King is writing as Bachman, and I'm niether impressed nor disappointed. \\"Roadwork\\" is about one man's struggle with life. He's broke, falling out of love, and miserable. When he finds out he has to move due to the construction of a highway, he gets...well...pissed off. This is a novel about retribution, and a vindictive middle aged man. It's very non-King, perhaps this is because he was writing as Richard Bachman. The book interested me, because it was one man, planning one act of revenge. It's definitely one of the more intriguing plots I've seen, but it was a little too shallow.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I had never really heard of Robbie Williams until a British cousin recommended I buy this CD as soon as it came out in the US.  He was right.  The songs while being extremely catchy are very moving.  In most songs, Robbie seems to be either singing about needing to love someone or not loving the person he's with.  But, on both types of songs, the sentiments actually seem very heartfelt.  If your taste in music runs toward non-teen pop like matchbox 20 or similar bands, then you will probably really enjoy this CD.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I watched this movie on a transatlantic flight and thought I was going to wake everyone up with my laughter.<br />It's charming, sweet, witty, inventive and everything a family comedy should be. Billy Crystal is especially superb.<br />Kudos to all from director to the animators.
B00006GFAB|2.0|I didn't really get the whole KISS thing the first time around, even though I happened to be smack dab in the middle of their target audience. So I bought this thinking maybe I was being too much of a musical snob back then.<br />I wasn't.<br />With a few notable exceptions like \\"Beth\\" and \\"Rock & Roll All Nite\\", these songs could've easily been taken from the soundtracks to great R-rated classics like Hollywood Hot Tubs or Hot Dog.<br />Thin Lizzy, Grand Funk, Bad Company, even Ted Nugent or Bachman Turner Overweight still seem to have more to offer if you're looking for a way to musically relive the 1970s.<br />But man, they still look really cool.
0440236738|3.0|When I'm assigned books to read for school, they're often so heavy and make you think a lot. When I'm doing \\"pleasure reading,\\" I like enjoyable experiences that won't bend my mind too harshly. <br />I enjoyed Harlan Coben's \\"Gone for Good,\\" although at times I felt the writing was too informal (like James Patterson). However, I read it faster than any other book in a long while, so that says something for it. I appreciated the plot twists, and the familial relationship within. This is the first book by Coben I've read, and I'll probably give TELL NO ONE a shot next.
B000088E6D|5.0|Was impressed, this is a great cd. I would recommend this cd to anyone who loves the greats of the swing/big band era. Buble has super voice and the song choices cover 40 years of good music with a modern feel. Wonderful.
B000083E79|5.0|What a great compilation cd,although the order of the cuts is rather random. And still this cd leaves some hits out, including the current disco smash, \\"When the Money's Gone, and \\"We all sleep alone\\".<br />Cher has 3 plus decades of folk rock, (All I really..)to current disco anthems with a few \\"gypsies \\" in between.The original version of \\"Bang Bang\\" is superior to the Geffen version, and that too is here.The voice that cuts through concrete sailed through the new millenium.Cher has been known as a single artist,and this cd supports her successes in the single arena.She has preveiled through several styles. Once again her 70's Warner Brothers material is missing,and there is no real reason for the dedicated fan to purchase this if they are looking for a stone unturned. The voice is powerful today as it was in the 70's,and the image only gains momentum.  Choicest cuts are \\"Believe\\", \\"Heart of Stone\\",and the 60's flower power anthem, \\"I got you babe\\" with Sonny Svengali Bono.<br />Cher proves a voice plus a character as strong as they come preveil.This so far is the definitive greatest hits package.So why is this icon absent from the rock and roll hall of fame I ask?Well perhaps the powers that be will reconsider after looking at this compilation?Five stars for the hits alone, even if there is some question on the order the tracks are placed in. This \\"babe\\" needs a comprehensive box set...
B000083E79|5.0|Cher's recorded for a lot of labels over the years. This is the first set to include recordings from all of them. Her 60s Sonny & Cher ATCO phase is represented by I Got You Babe and The Beat Goes On (I would have liked to have seen Baby Don't Go included here too). Her 60s solo hits on Liberty, Bang Bang and All I Really Want To Do are here (omitting the hits Alfie and You Better Sit Down Kids is no big whoop). <br />In the 70s, Cher recorded for Kapp/MCA. Her trilogy of trash (Gypsies Tramps & Thieves, Half-Breed, and Dark Lady) are here, but not the top 10 Way Of Love (where Cher sounds like a man) or her hits with Sonny (All I Ever Need Is You, A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done). Her lone Casablanca hit from the 70s, the disco fave Take Me Home, is here, hinting at Cher's future as a dance diva.<br />In the 80s, Cher made a major comeback on Geffen Records singing power ballads like Heart Of Stone, I Found Someone, Just Like Jesse James, and If I Could Turn Back Time and the wedding fave After All with Peter Cetera. The one major recording left off from this era is my theme song: We All Sleep Alone.<br />Major comeback number two, with Cher as the ultimate dance diva on Warner Brothers, is well-represented by her hits Believe, Strong Enough, Song For The Lonely, and Different Kind Of Love Song (the latter improved in a faster-paced mix).<br />Even if you have Cher's strong collection If I Could Turn Back Time, you should get this for the added Warner Brothers dance hits and 60s Liberty singles, plus The Beat Goes On. It would take two discs to get all of Cher's hits collected and until someone does, this Rhino set is clearly the best sampler
B00004TJLD|1.0|Very dissapointing.  This is a stereo only version.  Save the money and time it takes to get it and buy the CD .. it's much better.
B00005OAIE|5.0|When everything (Alternative Rock and the likes) seemed to be mushing together to form one big sound, John Mayer came through with a breath of fresh air.  His music is original, upbeat, and clever.  Another review said &quot;he just talks about georgia and neon...&quot;... HELLO?  It's a Metaphor.  Anyways, this is a great album, I recommend it to all.
B00006JKOM|3.0|After the last album-length epic A Passion Play, Jethro Tull released a string of interesting albums from the mid 1970s to the early 1980s that explored different sounds. Of the albums between War Child and A, Too Old To Rock 'N' Roll is my least favorite although it is still very good with a few excellent tracks. The songs tie together around the character Ray Lomis, an old rocker who is bitter when he is no longer the bee's knees only to find that his old school style has come back in fashion with the young people. The story is offered in comic strip form with the album. Ian Anderson was only 29 when this album came out (but with the straggly beards, most of the fellows in Tull always looked older than they were). There is a lot of orchestra on this album courtesy of David Palmer. My favorite is the first song \\"Quizz Kid\\". It is an upbeat track with cool flute and cymbal jamming. Lyrically, it is one of Ian Anderson's most clever songs. \\"Salamander\\" is a beautiful acoustic number that is less than 3:00. The many short, acoustic tracks Anderson offered on Jethro Tull's albums (i.e. \\"Only Solitaire\\" on War Child, \\"Cheap Day Return\\" & \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\" on Aqualung, etc.) are wonderful and much better than the usual instrumental fillers. \\"Pied Piper\\" is an interesting track and \\"Taxi Grab\\" has a country rock feel with Anderson putting down the flute in favor of the harmonica. The music video for the title track is a lot of fun and worth seeking out. The rest of the album never captured me as most Tull albums do. It is definitely a fine album, but not up to the very high standards of previous and later Tull releases. It is not as solid, in my opinion. Still, it is a fun enough album that new Tull fans should not pass up. It will appeal to baby boomers or those interested in the changing pop culture of that time with references to Jack Kerouac, etc. This re-mastered version is the way to go. One of the extra tracks, \\"Strip Cartoon\\", was offered on the limited edition 20th Anniversary box set and is a fun little number.
B000089RVX|3.0|heavier music fronted by a female singer rarely reaches mainstream attention these days (if the atrocity known as Kittie comes to mind, they don't count because they awful and those vocals aren't really \\"female\\" IMO). Evanescene has been completely overhyped for their alleged originality, however. I'm saddened by these reviews to see nary a mention of the incredible Dutch band The Gathering, a group that has been doing this kind of thing for years and years. Anneke van Gierbergen's voice is absolutely stunning and the rest of the band has killer songwriting chops. Their first two female-fronted albums, _Mandylion_ and _Nighttime Birds_ are evocative wonders of melodic metal. Lately, the band has been experimenting with lush, ethereal rock that is equally arresting and amazing on _How to Measure a Planet?_ and _if-then-else_. Their new album, _Souvenirs_ is stunningly gorgeous. Other artists of note are Persephone's Dream, Brave, Lacuna's Coil, et cetera et cetera. This really isn't a new thing!
B000001FS6|5.0|Why are some people so hard to please? I mean, what's not to like. It's a 17 track album, full of live songs, new songs, and great covers. Obviously something with this much variety may not play through smoothly, but it's all good. Besides the nods to many great musicians, some of them live, you get new U2 classics like &quot;Desire&quot;, &quot;Hawkmoon 269&quot;, &quot;Heartland&quot;, and &quot;All I want is you&quot;. Those four alone make this well worth having. Some complain about U2's ego and arrogance in &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;. So what. Ask yourself, who are the Beatles, Hendrix, Dylan, and Elvis of today? I bet alot of people will say U2. And as far as the movie goes, I was so excited when it came out, that I walked all the way across town to see it. I would do that again now. Listen, watch, and enjoy.
B00008H2LE|4.0|I loved Hybrid Theory, so I my have expected too much. This album is good but doesn't compare to the greatness of its predecessor. The songs are good and definitely in the style of Linkin Park. Unfortunately I can't really single out any that are truly memorable or that stick in your head for hours. Don't get me wrong though, this is a good album and is worth the money, which is becoming less and less an occurrence in this one hit wonder world. <br />  As for the DVD... I would only buy the DVD if you love to hear the band members explain how the album was put together. It isn't terribly interesting unless you like stories of mixing and laying down tracks. There are no videos or concert footage. <br />  Anyway. I would recommend this album to Linkin Park fans, but don't get the DVD with it unless you're Linkin Park OBSESSED.
0316666343|2.0|This book is a totall disappointment!! I got it the second it came out because talk of it was soo great...well i dont know what the fuss is about!? First off, it is sad as all hell! Second, it is strange...not just kinda strange..its downright weird! I mean this little girl is raped and then watches her family from heaven, and then gets a chance to spend a night back on earth?? Hmmm...The book starts off OK and then it goes straight down hill! The writing is not great, its a good way to pass time if its the only book left in the bookstore..hehe..or on Amazon! Pass this one up and Read \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" by arthur golden. Now that is a good book about a girl with a hard life...and the writing is awesome.
B000002A3T|5.0|I baught this CD awhile ago being a Pink Floyd fan, now that i am an all out teenager, during the day I, like other highschoolers, undergo a great amount of stress. So one night i just decided to play this CD while i was in bed, alone in the dark with just my thoughts and this CD. The opening track, &quot;Cluster One&quot; sets the tone, it takes you from whatever problems you deal with in your life and puts you in a complete state of bliss and relaxation, the only other 2 pink floyd songs that come close to &quot;Cluster One&quot; would have to be &quot;Signs of Life&quot; from AMLoR, or the begining of &quot;Shine on you Crazy Diamond&quot; from the PULSE disk. I cant get over it, i was in complete &quot;meditation&quot; by the first 2min. of Cluster One, but thats not all. This disk definetly proves itself from begining to end (with the exception of Great Day For Freedom, which is way too boring and has no climax in my opinion). If you havent heard this disk yet you have to be completley insane not to pick it up. I wish Pink Floyd would come out with some new music that has the same sound of this album, because in my opinion, this album is a sheer Masterpeice. If you also notice, there are defferent versions of artwork on this CD, some of the heads on the cover are metal, where as others are wooden, and there are different backgrounds too. This album is a MUST HAVE for any Floyd fan, and belongs right next to Momentary Lapse of Reason in any CD collection...
B00003CXAE|5.0|I went to watch this movie in 1998 when I was 11 when it came out in theatres to celebrate it's 20 year anniversary (I believe.. was it 25th?). Now, more than five years later, I still haven't forgotten how captivated I was watching that film on the big screen. <br />Since then, I have purchased the film, but I still find it hard to believe that it's an &quot;old&quot; film. The plot is simple, but the music makes it work. The script (the acting seems fine to me, although others have commented it as being mediocre) is flawless; every character's own personal story and turmoil is written perfectly into the big picture.<br />All the songs are great. I love the songs sung by the main cast (ex. Greased Lightning, Sandy...). The soundtrack is a great one, too. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good flick. Even if you don't like musicals (and I don't), you'll fall in love with this movie time and time again. It just doesn't get old.
B00008J4P5|5.0|It's good news that modern rock radio hasn't abandoned the White Stripes; \\"Seven Nation Army\\" is getting a ton of airplay. It was smart to get the new disc, Elephant, out while their 2001 late bloomer, White Blood Cells, is still fresh on the mainstream's mind. Elephant just might be a better record.<br />Frankly, it's not easy to make pure rock particularly interesting. Founding fathers such as Chuck Berry get a lot of kudos, but in 2003 his records are boring as hell. The blues is dull, which is why Chuck Berry turned up his amp in the first place. But every now and then a band comes along that can hold your attention. And by \\"your attention,\\" I apparently mean everyone in America, because they all turned out for the White Stripes.<br />You may or may not remember when the Presidents of the United States of America and the Squirrel Nut Zippers each \\"benefitted\\" from the freak occurrence of flipping to the big time before taking overnight success to its inevitable disastrous end. When indie phenoms catch the public's attention, it's a fatal disease.<br />But the White Stripes will endure. Elephant will be successful because the timing is right and because the White Stripes -- despite the silly suits, the no-bass gimmick and the contrived hillbilly family relations -- are not a novelty act and do not write novelty songs. Jack White writes good songs from simple elements, like the Rolling Stones were able to do in the early '70s.<br /> <BR>In addition to songs, you've got squealing-... guitar solos on \\"Ball and Biscuit,\\" \\"Black Math\\" and \\"Hypnotise.\\" \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" even has a fantastic vocal performance and \\"Girl You Have No Faith in Medicine\\" is as good as any Bon-era AC/DC classic. It's not all stupidhead music, either. \\"The Air Near My Fingers\\" lets a Rhodes organ carry some subtle melody, \\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\" is a genuine ballad, and \\"It's True That We Love One Another\\" closes the record with an autobiographical folk duet.<br />So the news is good. They didn't sell out, they didn't run out of ideas, and they were able to find still more places to yell \\"Whooo!\\" Go buy this now. <br />Ric Dube <BR>Junkmedia.org Review
0385504209|5.0|Okay, I can understand now why the other reviewer said that the story had been told before. However, I have two things to say to him: First, you should have marked your review Spoiler. Second, just because a story has been told before doesn't mean that there isn't something to be gained in a retelling. For example, John Milton's Paradise Lost is a reinterpreted and retold Genesis. Romeo and Juliet has been retold so many times that it is ridiculous. And yet, both are worthwhile. It is only part the story that is important. The more important thing is how the story is told.<br />Dan Brown tells a story that has been told before, yes. However, he tells it beautifully, and he is my favorite author. I have yet to read one of his books that disappointed me in the least. Each is Crichton-esque, but even more packed with research, care, and good story. I can't get enough of this guy's work.<br />Read this book. You won't regret it.<br />Harkius
B00005UK1F|5.0|Another sleeper....    Great melodies, a big sweeping sound, massive orchestral and choir accompaniment.  No overplaying, no  bombastic technical insanity.<br />Its always great to find new stuff that is in the same league as Symphony X.   There must be something in the water in Sweden, Norway, Finland (and New Jersey?) as they continue to produce these wonderful original bands.
0385504209|5.0|Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is in Paris attending a conference where he was to have met Jacques Sauniere, curator of the Louvre, but the eccentric curator failed to keep their appointment.  Latter that night Langdon is pulled from sleep by the French equivalent of the FBI, it seems Jacques Sauniere has been murdered and left a cryptic message on the floor of the museum and on his own body.  The police seem to want Langdon's skills as a symbologist to crack the case completely unaware that he is the prime murder suspect.<br />Enter Sophie Neveu, a cryptologist, a woman as intelligent as she is beautiful and, as it happens, granddaughter of the murdered curator. She believes that not only is Langdon is innocent but he is in danger.  Together they flee the scene and begin work on solving the murder of Jacques Sauniere.  The clues Sophie's grandfather left behind will lead the couple on an unparallel treasure hunt across Europe and the last two thousand years.  Their investigations lead them through secret societies, power hungry villains, and some of the most famous pieces of art and architecture of the last thousand years.  All to discover the hiding place of the Holy Grail.  Where the grail is however is secondary to WHAT the grail is and each question answered leads only to another question.  Mr. Brown takes all these elements and weaves them together with Leonardo DaVinci, Sir Isaac Newton and the Vatican itself.  Where does the trail lead? To places unexpected to be sure.  Sophie and Robert are never sure just how deep the rabbit hole really is.  Every time they believe they are on solid ground Mr. Brown pulls the carpet out from under them and the find themselves plunging deeper into the complexities of the mystery itself.<br />In the middle of the book the characters examine DaVinci's famous fresco \\"The Last Supper\\" I was compelled to find a picture to see for myself what Mr. Brown was asserting about the figures in the painting.  Upon looking at the painting I was awe struck that Mr. Brown was indeed correct and I was left to wonder just how I had missed what is so plainly obvious.  You would do well to have a copy of this famous painting along with others by DaVinci to see for yourself just how well the clues fit together.<br />Spending an afternoon in the reference section of the library I found that the assertions Mr. Brown puts fourth in his book regarding early Christianity, the Holy Grail and the many secret societies are based on facts and not fictions at all.  This itself makes the book all the more compelling and the paranoia he laces into his work all the more real.<br />Dan Brown's earlier novel, \\"Angels and Demons\\", featured the same protagonist, Robert Langdon. Like the previous book, \\"The DaVinci Code\\" is a well-researched thriller and Brown manages to educate without losing too much pacing. \\"The DaVinci Code\\" is a great history lesson about ancient Christianity and matters related to The Holy Grail.nting I was awe struck that Mr. Brown was indeed correct and I was left to wonder just how I had missed what is so plainly obvious.

0440236738|5.0|You can tell he isn't Jewish even though the characters in this book are supposed to be, but it's lacking there.  It keeps you on your toes with suspense.  The only bad thing is that he gives so many details about every single thing, but in the end it is summed up so quickly that you feel like some areas must have been cut by the editor.  I would recommend it.
B00008DDXC|5.0|A wonderful movie for children and adults alike!  If you liked the book, you will love the movie!  Very true to the book, and the graphics and scenery are even more spectacular than the first movie.  A must have for all Harry Potter fans!
0671027387|5.0|Dan Brown can keep you clutching your book, well into the night, despite your better intentions to put it down. If you have to move, you will take the book with you. To the bathroom, to the breakfast table, even to your important meeting the next day.<br />Quite possibly one of the best of his generation's storytellers, Dan Brown weaves a fascinating tale of betrayal, military force, and scientific intrigue. All of his books are extremely well researched, combining the facts most of us desire with the what-if that most of us fear. A compelling storyteller with his head in the clouds and his feet on the ground, he is one of his generation's best.<br />This book doesn't fail to produce. I won't spoil the book for you, but trust me when I tell you not to think that you know what is going on until the end and you have put the book down. It is awesome!<br />A great read, and highly recommended.<br />Harkius
B000002UB3|5.0|In my opinion, this has to be one of the greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone said that Revolver was better, but this one is much better in my opinion.<br />1. Come Together - Great nonsense lyrics with a great drum beat and bass line drive this tune<br />2. Something - Extremely good Harrison tune, with a simple yet very catchy guitar line.    <br />3. Maxwell's Silver Hammer - Paul song with a very lullaby-pop feel to it (if not a little violent). I personally love this tune<br />4. Oh! Darling - Don't get me wrong, I love this song, but its not one of my favorites, although Paul's voice soars on it<br />5. Octopus's Garden - How could a Ringo tune be so damn good? Another lullaby-pop song that [rocks]<br />6. I Want You (She's So Heavy) - probably my favorite John Lennon song. It's pretty haunting.<br />7. Here Comes the Sun - wow what a good george song. very beautiful, this song is     <br />8. Because - It appears some people don't like this. Well it's one of my favorite songs on the CD. Its pretty much 90% singing and it still remains very trippy<br />9. You Never Give Me Your Money - This song kicks off the medley. Paul may be a [snob], but he wrote some damn good piano stuff.<br />10. Sun King - Probably my least favorite on the album, but still a good song (and a little comical). Great bassline<br />11. Mean Mr. Mustard - man what a driving beat. this song just SCREAMS for you to like it<br />12. Polythene Pam - another goofy John tune (which ironically, Tom Petty seemed to [borrow] in his song You Wreck Me, which has the same guitar part)<br />13. She Came in Through the Bathroom Window - not much to say but a great Paul song<br />14. Golden Slumbers - Another great Paul tune which touches the heart<br />15. Carry That Weight - Very catchy lyrics which also goes back into a reprise of You Never Give Me Your Money<br />16. The End - what a damn damn good song. I have heard many many many drum solos, and for some reason the one Ringo does in this songwhich is so incredibly simple always sticks in my mind. (just a funny note: can you guess the Lennon solos? hint: they are the ones that aren't that good)<br />17. Her Majesty - pretty decent song, but a dumb thing to put at the end. I mean, shouldn't the CD end with the song called The End? Not to mention The End gives soooo much closure and then this rediculous acoustic tune pops out of nowhere. Paul should have saved it for his solo career...<br />There you have it! I hope I convinced you to buy it, because it will be a great addition to your CD collection.
B0000004V2|5.0|This is the most magical album of the last twenty years. Most albums now cannot hold their consistency throughout, while the Stone Roses kills the whole way through. The leadoff track, I Want To Be Adored, sets the tone for one of the most laid back and beautiful things put to record. Songs such as Waterfall and She Bangs the Drums bring a tear to my eye and make me yearn for younger summer days. There even is some mild funk to close off the masterpiece with Fools Gold, which even at nearly 10 minutes does not drag. All I can say is I was blown away by this work, and it singlehandedly reaffirmed my love of music.
B0000029DD|4.0|Unfortunately, my first awareness of Jeff Buckley came with the news reports of his disappearance in a lake in Memphis. Even then it wasn't until a couple of years after his death that I picked up Grace on a whim. I'm sad that I didn't know of and  appreciate this talent until he was gone. I've tried to make amends for my late start by recruiting my friends into the cult of Jeff...usually with mixed results.<br />Considering how he died, it's downright spooky at times to hear all the references to water. One has to wonder if Buckley foresaw his end but in a way it adds to the poignancy. Standouts include So Real, Lover You Should've Come Over (just a straight out beautiful song) and Dream Brother. The last song is supposedly directed to a friend of Buckley's but sounds as if could be about Buckley's own non-existent relationship with his father Tim. Buckley's version of Leonard Cohen's song, Hallelujah, served as a soothing lullaby for many after the tragedies of 9/11. I can and often do play this track over and over. Eternal Life, a song that many view as an ode to Led Zepplein, took some getting used to. Initially, it's sounds out of place on the CD but after repeated listenings, I grew to appreciate it.<br />It's unfortunate Buckley didn't get enough attention for this work before he left us but true musical lovers should appreciate his gift in the form of this CD.
038572179X|1.0|I wish I had read the reviews here on Amazon before I picked it up. Had I seen the various comments toward Woolf I would have run away screaming. For those who enjoy overdescriptive multisyllabic \\"in the moment\\" writings, this book will be a joy. Personally I have already lived through (aka had been forced to) reading Woolf -- and I don't have to anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't understand all the big words, it's just downright annoying to be distracted by them.  When I read I want to become so engrossed in the story that I forget I'm reading. With this book, that doesn't happen for me; I'm instead bored with the colorless characters and incessant descriptions of their surroundings. I will probably donate this to the local book drive where some poor kid will have to read it for school.. at least he won't have to pay full price.
B0000025D0|5.0|Darkness On The Edge Of Town is my pick for best Springsteen album by a narrow margin. Sure, Born To Run may be more grandiose and better-known, but I prefer the realism and grit of Darkness over the overly saccharine (at times) Born To Run.<br /><br />The end result of a 3-year long contract battle, Darkness shows an angry and weary Bruce. His guitar playing assumes a more important role here, and the sound is much harsher than any of Springsteen's other albums. The E-Street effect is still present, but is much less evident than in Born To Run. At times Bruce is only accompanied by a piano, which serves to amplify the somberness of the lyrics (Racing In The Street, for example). The lyrics and atmosphere are far more cynical and dark than Born To Run, and reflects a downtrodden and almost bleak concept.<br /><br />While the mood is darker, it's far from hopeless. Badlands and The Promised Land in particular display a sense of longing for a life the protagonists know is out there. However, in the end the characters are still left searching for a way out, as evidenced by the somewhat anticlimactic title track.<br /><br />Musically, this is Bruce at his peak. There are lots of \\"wow\\" moments on this album--the bitter Adam Raised A Cain, the hushed Something In The Night, the rockin' Candy's Room (my all-time Springsteen favorite, barring perhaps Rosalita and Jungleland), and the lamentful Racing In The Street.<br /><br />While I'm not a huge Springsteen fan, I can't deny that he had a very strong run of enjoyable material and albums in the first 15 years of his career (ending with Nebraska, in my opinion) and Darkness On The Edge Of Town ranks as the apex of his career. Highly recommended.
1577311523|3.0|In reading this book, I felt as though there is only way to achieve more conscienceness...getting your mind out of the way.  And there was only one goal...being.  There was no getting there or journey.  There was no exploring, just the goal, no path. I think life is all about the trip, not the ultimate destination, and I think this book is all about the destination.  This is too much 0 to 100 in ten seconds.  I think Judith Wright's book, There Must Be More Than This considers that the reader is on a journey to conscienceness and writes with that in mind.  I liked her book better.
B000089RVX|5.0|I was at first very sceptical about this album. I am a pop music girl who loves Britney, christina and such. Listening to this album was a sort of a revelation to me. A great album with great songs. Every song has it's own amazing quality. I'd say a must buy!
B000002VCB|4.0|I like this CD,But it scares me alot when I listen to Lucifer:I kinda think there's a Ghost at my back.The Rest is cool.
B00008H2LB|3.0|im an avid fans on LP. Hybrid theory was one of my all time favourite album.It was so good i can still taste the honey dripping from it each time i listen to the hybrid theory. thus im skeptical and fear that LP follow up album will not be as good as hybrid theory.i got lucking of gettin LP merchandise at the album launch dis time but that would not help the concern about the 2nd album outcome.so finally like it or not the release is out anyway. all i can say that this album is a 'playing safe'album that reuse samples from hybrid theory, reaarange, remix it, and add some new sample to be able to get to hybrid theory quality. actually there are some tracks that is great to the ear and radio friendly but at the same time u cant help but notice some similarities from hybrid theory music.i dunno if they plan it or not or it might be coincident or maybe dejavu?i dun want to give example which song resemble which song..its ur job to buy the album and map the similarities between the two album.hmm..maybe LP guys want us to play some &quot;match the sound&quot; game?i dunno..main point is for fans, u can buy the album, no harm with that.for new fans..u better buy &quot;hybrid theory&quot; before buyin &quot;Meteora&quot;.i expect something better from LP.but anyway..dis is ok enough.

Bravo!
0743455967|3.0|For what it is, this is a good book and well written. 'For what it is?' Yes. As far as it goes it's a reasonable primer on how King writes and a candid summary of his life, including horrific booze and drug problems. But writers wanting help with career choices are unhelped. Dozens of writing careers are open to those who have a facility with words. King deals with none except writing horror novels. It's what he knows, apparently all he knows.<br />King's attitude on editing needs help, too. Unless possessing unnatural chutzpah, a quality writer must edit and re-edit word by word, line by line, many times, before final draft. Poor editing is like failure to finish a project, just 'roughing in' parts that seem unimportant. Readers always know better in any subject requiring careful research and writing; readers lost through inattention to detail are rarely recovered after a book has been tossed across the room. This matters little to King since his genre is horror fantasy (few rules, few facts).<br />Another aspect of the book disappoints: King tells us too little of the biggest challenge facing today's writers: the almost impossible task of finding a capable, professional agent. He gives this area a mere 'lick and a promise' and the story of his composite writer, 'Frank,' rings hollow. Agents are the publishing indusry's gatekeepers; without one a writer is virtually condemned to wasting time at the word processor. It's simple economics. Publishers cannot afford to screen the huge volume of unsolicited ms coming in daily and consigned to the 'slush pile,' though they know much fine writing lies buried there. Today's writing markets, unless you are established or a celebrity, is 'pull' and not 'push.' If you're a fad phenom, you may be pulled. If not, you will more likely starve.<br />Many are called, few chosen. Luck is as important as skill. King carefully avoids this painful reality, identical in essentially every other career in the arts.
0786915749|5.0|when i started this book i did not know what to think i was not sure if it was going to be interesting or not. After a little bit it started to get interesting and i realized that i was reading the book 24/7. I could not put it down. It was full of suspense and action. I liked the &quot;romance&quot; and that action. All of the different genra's put together makes it a really good book.
B00008H2LB|3.0|I'll start off by saying that LINKIN PARK is probably the best band in this whole mix of rap-rock that is out right now.  That said though, Meteora shows me that Linkin Park has absolutely no future as it stands today.  Chester Bennington has a very good rock voice and lyrically he is probably above average compared to other nu-metal bands.  Mr. Hahn can make a nice beat and his samples are pretty damn good.  The instrumental on LP are pretty [poor] but then all of these nu-metal bands are like that.  Now where LINKIN PARK totally falls short is in the rap department.  Mike Shinoda is absolutely horrible.  The man truly [is bad.] Meteora proves to me that for this band to be truly great they need to dump the raps and stick to straight rocking.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Es impresionante la calidad de audio y video de las historicas imagenes, que desde hace mas de 40 años nos han conmocionado. Sobre todo ver juntos a George Ringo y Paul en 1994 y 1995, como buenos amigos, cantando y recordando sus mejores tiempos con John, es en extremo emocionante.<br />Le doy 5 estrellas por que no hay mas. Pero los Beatles son los Beatles y no hay unidades de medida que se ajusten a su talento.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I, like most people, didn't think they could match or top hybrid theory.... they did... thats it.
B000002UQJ|4.0|Opinion of this album seems to be split between those that love it and those that hate it. This is actually one of my favourites and I listen to this CD more than I listen to the more lauded 'Flowers In The Dirt' and 'Flaming Pie'. The reason???? I just find the production on this album to be less cluttered and less dated. It's a pretty low key production effort from Julian Mendleson with synths and effects kept to a minimum (exception is the title track), and I find this suits the Macca sound and allows his melodies to shine through.  As for the songwriting , it pretty consistent throughout. Good catchy pop songs 'Off The Ground', 'Hope Of Deliverence', 'Peace In The Neighbourhood', 'C'mon People' mixed with some truly gorgeous ballads 'Winedark Open Sea' , 'I Owe It All To You', 'Golden Earth Girl' the latter three tracks presented quite simply with no big orchestral scores therefore sounding nice and fresh. ('Winedark Open Sea' makes a nice sunset song I think!!). Also there are the Elvis Costello collaborations 'Mistres &amp; Maid' and 'The Lovers That Never Were' which are just as good as the ones that appeared on 'FITD' but again do not suffer from the rather insipid production of that album and are more representative of what can be heard on the excellent McCartney/MacManus demos bootleg. <BR>Sure the lyrics are a bit banal in places , but hey it's only words and they never detract from the enjoyment of the music for me. And a lot of people have sited 'Biker Like An Icon' as a bad track but to me it's a nice little rocker. The only real filler here is 'Get Out Of My Way' which is a typical MOR type affair but it moves along quite nicely in it's own way and was fun to see live.  All in all I find this disc to be a very good listen...not his best but a long way from being the failure some people would have you believe.
B000083E79|5.0|Cher is a living legend and despite her critics has had major musical success for almost forty years!  She is the only artist EVER to have top ten hits in each of the last four decades and she has the longest time span between her first number one hit and her most current number one hit.  Why LIVING PROOF wasn't more successful is a mystery as it is one of her best albums ever and comes in the heals of the mega hit BELIEVE.  My guess the marketing wasn't up to par since she's from the older generation.<BR>The only problem I have with this collection is there are no extras.  I would have loved to hear her versions of &quot;Love is in the Air&quot; and &quot;Don't leave me this way&quot; which could have easily been added on to the end.<BR>This artist is due a box set and it amazes me she doesn't have one.
B000002J27|5.0|This CD shows the versatility of Phil Collins as drummer, singer, and song-craftsman, having taken over the spot left vacant by Peter Gabriel's 1975 departure from the band.  &quot;Dance On A Volcano&quot; starts the listener jumping with its 7-beat tempo.  &quot;Entangled&quot; is the sleeper here.  &quot;Squonk&quot; is the tale of a delicate little creature whose sadness is its defense.  &quot;Mad Man Moon&quot; tells the story of a traveller stuck in a desert.  The disco-flavored &quot;Robbery, Assault, And Battery&quot; is the most comical number here.  The title song is about a strange beast wandering from his otherworldly home, only to encounter suffering at the hands of the human race.  &quot;Ripples&quot; is an ethereal song of water.  &quot;Los Endos&quot; is the CD's intense closing number, containing references to the CD's first and third tracks, a device often used in Classical music and jazz fusion.
0694525499|5.0|I find it a lot harder to review a book I love than to review one that I think could be improved, and I really loved Neil Gaiman's American Gods. The book is a fantastic piece of literature, an insightful study of America and American culture, a provocative exploration of religion and belief, and an exposition of masterful storytelling.<br />Prior to American Gods, I had read most of Gaiman's Sandman series of graphic novels. Fans of that series will find that Gaiman's talent for weaving dark, profound, and involving plots transfers beautifully to the format of a novel. At the same time, the book does not read like a script for a comic; Gaiman is at least as much of a master of the purely written medium as he is of the illustrated one.<br />Another group of readers to whom I would recommend American Gods are fans of the work of Douglas Adams. Readers of Adams' Long, Dark Tea-Time of the Soul will find a fair amount of the conceptual grounding for American Gods to be familiar territory. This is not to say that Gaiman book is a redux of the Tea-Time. The two books share the idea of ancient gods living in a modern world, but treat it in very different (complementary) ways. I highly recommend reading both books, each with the other in mind.<br />To conclude I would like to talk specifically about the audiobook. I &quot;experienced&quot; American Gods by listening to an installment of the unabridged audiobook every night for about five months. I listen to a lot of audiobooks and was enormously impressed with the narration of this one. George Guidall is a phenomenal performer and his carefully nuanced reading of the book added greatly to my enjoyment of the plot. Toward the end of the book, I considered buying the paperback and finishing it on my own as that would have been quicker, but it wasn't hard to decide to leave the reading to Guidall, whose voice had become part of the book's identity for me. I recommend the book on its own, but I recommend the audiobook even more strongly!e strongly!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Despite the contrary beleif that Linkin Park has not lived up to their original talent is totally off the mark. Hybird Theory, which was a new and exciting blend of Hip hop, rock, and electonica that blew open doors to music making. That is what they have acheived on this album.<BR>     The album hits the emotional side of people with the lyrics which speak to everyone, and they hit the heavy rock side of people who want some good tunes to just bang there heads to. Each song on this ablum has the orignalitly that they are so good at.<BR>     They know they can't touch what they did on Hyrid Theory but this CD lives up to there name. It shows they have matured musicly and will continue to grow. they care alot about their fans and make sure to put the best they can into everything they do.
B00005JL96|5.0|Cutest movie in 2002....hands down!! Stitch was my kinda guy...it had a great storyline to it and it was just a great family movie!! Right up there with Ice Age!!!
6302779278|4.0|When I first watched &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; I loved it. It was filled with suspense, drama, romance, and the beautiful voice of Whitney Houston. I think Whitney did such a good job in the role because she was basically playing herself and didn't have that far to stretch acting-wise. The chemistry between Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner seemed pretty good, but Costner seemed so dry much of the time, but maybe that suited his character more - someone who doesn't let his feelings show. I heard that this movie was originally going to be made with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross. I'm sure that would have been an interesting and good pairing, but I can't imagine anyone else but Whitney Houston playing the role of superstar singer, Rachel Marron.
B00005JKZT|4.0|Okay, let me start off that I'm NOT a Tolkien purist! I love Tolkien's work and I think Peter Jackson is doing a wonderful job with the movies.<BR>Alright, now to be honest I was a little disappointed with the Two Towers--only with ONE thing! And that was Treebeard...I really wished Peter shouldn't have changed Treebeard because I really loved Treebeard in the book! And to much of my surprise I was shocked that they changed Treebeard. Oh well, it's been done and there's nothing I can do about it.<br />Anyway, I'll get on with my review.<BR>From the beginning to the end of the movie...I was just so amazed. I loved it all except for the Treebeard part, I was so disappointed. But I loved the Frodo and Sam, Elijah Wood did another wonderful job as Frodo. He's getting more drawn to the ring and Sam's trying his best to keep Frodo to his senses. Then there's Gollum--and he's no where near being another Jar Jar Brinks! Who would do a better job than Andy Serkis? I thought Andy was brillant and he seemed to do the role of Gollum perfectly. I never had a good image of Gollum but the sound of his voice is how Andy did in the movie.<BR>   Then the Helm's Deep battle...wow. I was just blown away with all the action and all those Uruk-hai. Took them five days to do that scene of Helm's Deep and wow, what a battle!<BR>The music in Two Towers is absolutely beautiful! I bought the OST a few days after I seen the movie.<BR>Well I really can't think of what else to put but all I can say that this movie was wonderful and I've only seen it twice in theaters. Although when it comes out on DVD I'm definity buying it and watching it as many times I can. I've watched Fellowship of the Ring on DVD and the extended dvd version so many times I lost count. Although I can't wait to see what happens in Return of the King. So this isn't much of review but I loved the movie, a little disappointed but liked it anyway. :D
B00006F2TV|5.0|I loved this movie.<BR>It Was a Great Adaptation from the comic books. Tobey Maguire, Though he doesn't look exactly like his comic book namesake,Peter Parker,does a great job portraying him. Willem Dafoe,a.k.a. the Green Goblin,is awsome in his role,but coudn't they Let him develop amnesia,like in the comics,before they Killed him off?James Franco,the Goblin's son,is stunningly similar looking to Dafoe.Kirsten Dunst is fine in her role,but that red hair is so fake looking. All in all this is a great movie For people of all ages.I am looking foward to the sequel.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This evening I sat with my son and watched this wonderful movie once again.  I think it is a stunning story, is a visual wonder, and has very attractive music.  The movie is so rich that you can pick up new details and poetic points with each new viewing.<br />While the English voice over actors are quite good, I do recommend a viewing or two with the Japanese voices and English subtitles.  I don't speak Japanese, but the characterization of THOSE voices adds a lot to the story and the English subtitles are a bit different than the voice over.<br />The creatures come, I suspect, from Japanese myth and are very different than anything I have experienced in Western myth.  It is quite wonderful.  There are powerful and disturbing images that might not be suitable for very young children, but there is no gore for gore's sake.  But the way the creatures become demons is very powerful and intense.<br />I am glad to own this disk and suspect you would enjoy it as well.
B000083E79|4.0|Im giving this hits cd 4 stars only because it has alot of good songs, however how about waiting til she has a couple more dance albums then release one with all the hits from that? This has a lot of songs on it already I have on another hits album minus the believe and living proof cuts. I think even a Cher Remix cd would be better, havent seen one of those. Hopefully in future someone will release one soon.
031218087X|5.0|Susan Fletcher, a cryptographer  and her school teacher boyfriend David's relationship is on rocky ground. David's new promotion and old-fashioned attitude towards being the bread-winner has put a strain on their relationship which Susan doesn't know how to mend, (she's the one with the bigger salary). Their relationship is strained further, when Susan's boss asks David to run an errand for him - in Spain.  Meanwhile, Susan has her own troubles. She's tracking a miraculous new encryption program called &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; which is expected to revolutionize Encryption as we know it.<br />I really enjoyed this thriller, and I particularly liked the character of Susan Fletcher. (It's nice to see more women in lead rolls in thrillers), I was a bit bored with the parts about David, because I found his transformation from simple high school teacher to 'super agent' to be unrealistic. I also disliked the fact that he had difficulty dealing with Susan's salary, I mean the guy's a teacher for goodness sake. I would expect he'd be used to lower wages! I also enjoyed the characterization of the other IT experts such as Jabba.<br /> While the ending held few surprises, I still thought this audiobook was great!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Man, Shakira. Can she sing? I would be more than frank if I said honestly dont care. For real, the only girl who can get away with OK music and still have me glued to the screen when her videos, commericials or live performances come on. <br />I'm sure their is no self-respecting man that says he likes this music. Come on, I know why you guys like Shakira. For the same reason I do. Possibly the hottest babe in pop.
6303402348|2.0|I've heard about 'Forrest Gump' for years, and recently I decided to rent it.  Is this movie supposed to be a cartoon?  I know movies can be unrealistic, but this movie is SO RIDICULOUSLY UNREALISTIC I found myself staring at the screen in disbelief.  What did this man not do in his lifetime?  It's as though he has been blessed by God and everything falls into his hands.  The moral of the story.. STAY STUPID AND OBLIVIOUS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND MIRACLES WILL HAPPEN TO YOU.
014028009X|1.0|I found this book horrible.  I have read sooo many better written, better interesting fiction novels.  I was not even able to finish this small thin book because there was nothing interesting about it.  Bridget's life was about booze and her infatuations and other stuff.  It was dull and pointless.  Hate thi book.
B0000508U6|2.0|Most of the songs on this album sound like a bunch of words put together to fill up space.  Take for example, the hit song 'Yellow'.  &quot;I wrote a song for you, and its called Yellow.&quot;  What the heck is that supposed to mean?  Most of the songs are dreary and lifeless.  Just because the lead singer sounds like he is in pain, doesn't mean that he is.  Just listen to the lyrics and you'll realize how silly the songs are.
B00008DZ81|5.0|Better direction, much, much better visual effects, better storytelling (since the book developed more exciting, compelling plots and the kids are bigger and wiser), great performances by all characters (you can see much improvement from the kids who play Harry, Ron, and Hermione, not forgetting the tension between 2 of them which should & MUST be developed more in the next installments!!) kids and adults alike; best of all, more fun, funnier, darker, creepier (it has ghosts, monsters, creepy-crawlies, and what have you, all in ONE movie!), more wicked and on-the-edge kinda feel (the unforgettable flying car scene, the heart-thumping Quidditch match, and the horrifying monster chase in the dungeon) to it all!! I just wish the movie was longer!! ;) <br />This is a must-own DVD for all HP fans out there!! Can't wait for the 3rd installment. Hopefully the direction is up to legendary Chris Columbus' level of captivation!! :)
1878424319|5.0|I was told about this book by a friend who was told about this book on an airplane by a passanger sitting with them.<BR>Once I got my hands on it, I couldn't put it down.<BR>This book &quot;The Four Agreements&quot; said so much that I knew... I just needed someone to plant that seed to wake me from the posion I had in my head.<BR>I didn't think very well of myself nor others for that matter.  I know now what it is that I need to practice daily to be much happier with me and others.<BR>I know now what it means when someone says, &quot;You will not be loved until you love yourself&quot;.<BR>How simple it really is if you had just known it really means....  It means so much more when you do love who you are.<BR>I can now say, I understand and I am HAPPY with ME. :)<BR>A great read.  Please don't think twice, buy it when you see it.  And you will see it.
B00008977N|4.0|First I preordered this DVD, since it is one of my favourites concerts on VHS. Then I read all the bad reviews on this DVD-release. Finally I got my own copy and whatched it to judge for myself.<br />This is more than a concert, it is a piece of art. The show is like a musical play, delivered with a diversity and such a warmth. All band members seems to have a good time. There is only one Gabriel... and the musicians are extraordinary good. Bassplayer and drummer really grooves tight together.<br />The widescreen video is not that good, a little grainy and blurry, especially when the whole stage is shown. But it is not that bad that some other reviewers have stated. I really like the 16:9 format and I do not bother if the video is not perfect.  <br />On the other hand you get a splendid DTS 5.1 audio track. The mix is perfect with Gabriel's voice up front. The female singer's voice is a bit burried in the sound on some tracks, but perfect on some, like Don't give up. Alltogether the 5.1 sound is an incredible improvement compared to former CDs and VHS. If you do not like the DTS track on this DVD, go out and buy yourself a new audio equipment.<br />The last issue: Do I hear what I see? On this one I can agree with some of the critisism. Even if the vocals and playing are live (maybe not 100% though), the editing is done so that you, from time to time, loose the presence feeling that is so important on a live DVD. For some strange reason this aspect was better delivered on the VHS. In all other aspects this DVD blow the VHS version away totally.
B00005YW4H|4.0|i think this item was fab. it had style well also relaxing you. I think that it's a hit , i mean the song are beautiful and have a hint of country to them with out being to much, and did you know that her dad was famous too. You will love norah jones the songs are kind of slow though but you might like it like that. thanx for read my review it's a wonderful cd and i hope you go get. !!!!!!!!!!
B00003BDXG|3.0|I remember reading Quentin Tarantino's great script for NATURAL BORN KILLERS before seeing the film. He wrote it in the late 80's and kept it until the early 90's when he sold it to director Oliver Stone (who wrote SCARFACE and directed PLATOON). At the time, Quentin Tarantino was not well-known, his only noticable work being a film that he wrote and directed in his debut, RESERVOIR DOGS in 1992. Therefore, Stone had his own vision for NATURAL BORN KILLERS, and practically re-wrote the script, only crediting Quentin Tarantino for the original story.<br />After reading the original script, it was disappointing to see how the movie steered so far from it. The film plays out a few different styles: it feels like a commercial, cartoon, video game, and music video all at the same time. The opening scene of the film plays well, it's definitely my favorite scene of the entire film, but the \\"creative\\" styles grow old fast. The techniques used put distance between the audience and the characters and make it hard for it to present that gripping quality Quentin Tarantino originally intended for.<br />Although, at times the colored flashing lights and black and white picture seem charming, they get in the way of the real film, preventing me from strongly reccomending this film. It's an unusual and interesting film, and made by a director who knows what he's doing, but it just doesn't hold up overall.
0066214122|3.0|Michael Crichton likes to list non-fiction books that he used as source material for his novels.  There is a lengthy list at the end of PREY, but he left a large category of literature out: his own back catalogue.  PREY so heavily recycles Crichton's past premises, scenarios, character types, and clichés that had anybody else written it, that person would have been charged with plagiarism.  The cardboard characters, always two or three steps behind the reader, are more nauseating than the intentionally gooey parts of the book, especially early on when Crichton is establishing their innocence and normalcy.  Yet despite these flaws, nobody writes more suspenseful science fiction than Michael Crichton.  Along with all the cliches, Crichton manages to recycle the fast pace and genuine suspensfulness of some of his better, earlier books.<br />Beyond copying himself, Crichton's original inspiration has always been FRANKENSTEIN.   PREY, like so many of his books, is about humans pushing a hot, exotic science too far.  Instead of dinosaurs or should-have-been-left-alone warrior apes in the jungle, this time the monster is a swarm of omnipotent micro-cyborgs (actually, many such swarms).  All the old elements are there - the conniving female lead who is eventually consumed by the consequences of her own greed, the subtly political male (this time Crichton manages to inject a paragraph about father's rights) protagonist, the company that puts profits ahead of safety, and the team of scientists who get picked off one by one.  <br />How many times can these ingredients make a good soup?  I don't know, but the stew hasn't lost its flavor yet.  Since it is impossible to read this book in more than a week, there's no major commitment in taking it on, so I felt what I got what was worth what I put into it.
B000089RVX|5.0|ok this is the best cd ive boughten in a long time!! wow buy this cd you will not be disappointed...the only way to describe this cd is simply...amazing.
B00003CXXM|3.0|I applaud Matt Damon for his writing abilities and The Talented Mr. Ripley was cool too but I'm not sure he's quote an action hero guy.  I actually thought he was the best in Ocean's Eleven, a film I didn't love but he's not quote right for the part here.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have to say at first I was a little skeptical about this ablum bassed on the first single but I gave it a chance anyway and I am so glad I did.  I found out that &quot;Dirrty&quot; is very much a misrepresentation of the ablum as a whole.  &quot;Dirrty&quot; did exactly what it was supposed to do, get people's attention.  Well I have to say that it sure did get mine and I loved the song, its a great party song for everyone.  After listening to the entire album I immediately loved three songs, &quot;Fighter,&quot; &quot;Beautiful,&quot; and &quot;Cruz.&quot;  Over time I realized that I would relate to many of the songs on this ablum.  I have a story of my own that was similar in one way or another that each song was able to help me get through or realize that I was better off.  Relatability is very rare in music today and I love it when artist write songs about personal experiences it makes them so much more meaningful to fans because we can relate.  So I give Christina 5 stars for an excellent album, her best yet and I can wait to hear what she has to say next.  Keep up the good work.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|With this single broad but deft stroke, the Clash revolutionized the way all of us young punk-rock fans and musicians viewed the wide world of musical possibilities. London Calling lifted punk up by its waistband (ouch!) and placed it on a higher level than had been conceivable before this landmark release. This is one of the most influential albums of the rock era (1956-present), and no intelligent music fan can afford to be without it.
B000088E6D|5.0|I read some of the reviews on this site after listening to this album many, many times and can't, for the life of me, understand how anyone with an ear for beautiful music wouldn't love Michael Buble'. I know I'm glad I found out about him and his music.<br />Although I may not be a professional musician, I have had the pleasure (that comes with age!) of hearing some of the greats perform, and this Mr.Buble' rates right up there with the best I've ever heard - and that in itself says a lot.<br />What is so refreshing is that he has his own sound and it's just a treat. He just seems to caress some of the words/songs the way Mr.Dean Martin did, yet he has a raw power that is remarkable.<br />Kissing a fool is a song I was not familiar with before, but I have come to really enjoy it. <BR>Put your head on my Shoulder (Paul Anka must be proud) and the Way you look tonight are movie soundtrack material. Overall this is probably the finest album I've purchased in the past ten years. I just hope Mr.Buble' doesn't make me wait that long for his next one. And in concert??<br />This album is wonderful music to listen to...
B00006CXXU|1.0|When I younger and listened to her first cd I found the meaning of the lyrics...sex. This cd is even worser than the first one; I remember the only why I bought had the first one was because of the song from Mulan. Stripped is just about sex and other foolish topics. She tries to write her own songs and they sound HORRIBLE!!!! I suggest that you go out and buy Britney Spears' Brintey because she a talented singer, song writer, and dancer. Don't except much from Christina; she will only disappoint you! I am suprise someone did not ban the Dirrty video from American television or put a paternal advisory on this cd; it is so dirty!!
B00005JLRT|5.0|Star Trek Nemesis was the best Star Trek movie I have ever seen. I loved it when I saw it at the theatre and I loved the anticipation up to the movie's release. I was so looking forward to the movie and I was not disappointed in the least. Tom Hardy's 'Shinzon' was by far the best villian for the TNG crew to battle. I personally got really tired of the Borg, especially after their overuse in Star Trek Voyager. I love Picard and he carried the movie so galliantly. Brent Spiner's 'Data' was by far the best portrayal of Data ever. The movie has a strong, solid script with action, adventure, intrigue and heart-breaking scenes, especially the climatic showdown between the Enterprise and the Scimitar. The best Trek movie ever! And one of the best sci-fi movies ever. ***** stars baby!
0321127420|3.0|I'm a little surprised by the number of rave reviews about this book. The book is ok, but there are some annoying problems that let it down. For starters, the lack of decent proofreading before going to print  its an expensive reference book and I would expect better quality. Secondly the colloquial vernacular only impedes, not complements the reading. Thirdly, the patterns seemed fewer than I expected and covering only elementary issues. I suppose the audience is primarily for enterprise architecture novices.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Words can't really describe how great I feel this album is.  It is twice the album that White Blood Cells was and I love that album.  If you want a true testament as to how good Elephant is, listen first to Ball and Biscuit.  Even the remake of the Burt Bacharach tune is well done.  The most amazing thing is to listen to this album and then think of groups most similar to the White Stripes, then realize that the music that comes from the White Stripes is from 2 people and with equipment that is not as advanced as the others.  I think that is what I love about this album, it is so throwback to the old days of rock where simplicity was beautiful and hard.  Not like today where rock has to have detuned guitars playing at the highest distortion level possible.  Thanks, White Stripes for the Best Album of 2003... I'm serious it is going to take a practically perfect album from someone for me to think otherwise!!  See for yourself... Enjoy!!!!
B000083E79|5.0|<br />Out of an uncountable number of Greatest Hits collections, this is the one we certainly can count upon. Unlike the previous TGH-Album, its not just released for sales promotion of her current album.<br />Definitely the biggest features of this CD are- BELIEVE, SONG For The Lonely, HALF Breed, ONE By One, HEART Of Stone, IF I could Turn Back Time, GYPSIES Tramps & Thieves, I GOT You Babe and her most recent no.1 (THIS Is)A DIFFERENT Kind Of Love Song - alongwith many others.<br />Totally spanning her entire carreer right from the 60's, this album is of the biggest help to discover Cher's glorious past for her newest fans. Offering a string of 21 melodies, this CD doesn't lets you take your ears off it! I need not explain why!<br />Presenting most of the genres, this CD also features 3 of her best duets, two with former hubby Sonny Bono, and one with Peter Cetera alongwith a remixed version of \\"DKOLS\\". I would've been even happier, if they'd have included her duet \\"Più Che Puoi\\" with Eros Ramazzotti. Anyways, the new songs from 'Believe' and 'Living Proof' albums only make the CD tougher<br />The multitalented, Oscar winning actress and Grammy winning singer Cher with her tallest position in the music world is still reigning high while almost all other divas are facing the earth. No one compares to her. Wishing her luck for future, I'd hugely recommend this CD with all my heart not only to her fans worldwide but to everyone intrested in good music. Hail to the true Queen of Music.
B000002H6C|4.0|After Master Of Puppets, Metallica had nowhere to go but down. And Justice For All is still a great album though. This was their first with new bassist Jason Newstead (not counting an EP of covers). The songs are (for the most part) well written, complex musically and well played. The only real problem with this album is the production. &quot;One&quot; became their first MTV video (after they said they'd never make one) and the beginning of the end for all the old fans. Their next album would break them into the mainstream and they'd never sound this good again. I'd recommend picking up Master Of Puppets and Ride The Lightning first, but this is definately worth getting.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Predictably, Hayao Miyazaki's \\"Spirited Away\\" won for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, and since then has become more popular. I have wanted to see this movie ever since it came out in theaters first, but haven't been able to since this weekend, when it was released into over 700 theaters (the highest theater count yet). The theater was packed, and, judging from the audiences reactions, they all enjoyed the film as much as I did. It is the story of a little girl who gets lost in a spirit world. She has to get a job and seeks help in trying to turn her parents back into humans, for they were turned into pigs. Along her adventure, she (don't remember the name, it was unfamiliar to me) makes friends, learns lessons about trust and greed, and overall becomes a stronger person because of her adventure. She goes into the world as a whiny, complaining, sort of a brat, and leaves as a strong individual who is now ready to handle anything. It is a truly charming story. Some other recommendations to go along with this are KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE (you can buy a 3 DVD set with this film, Kiki's, and another animated feature), MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, and PRINCESS MONONOKE. If you can, try to go out and see this movie while it's still in theaters (by the time my review is published, it still will be, and buy the DVD while you're at it. It's no surprise this movie swept the nation of Japan, and is winning the hearts of many in our own homeland! Go see this movie, you won't regret it! E-N-J-O-Y-!-!-!-!-!
B000002H33|5.0|Master Of Puppets is easily Metallica's best album. In fact, it may just be the best metal album of all time. Nothing more can really be said. Every metal fan should own this; if you don't, be sure to pick it up.
B00008J4P5|5.0|You might ask yourself if it's possible for 'Elephant', the follow-up to their breakthrough album 'White Blood Cells' to be better and take the band to a new creative plateau.  It's possible.<br />'Elephant' picks up where 'White Blood Cells' left off and adds a healthy dose of bass, distortion, and a higher level of songwriting.  Jack solidifies his position as the guitar god of the &quot;neo-garage rock&quot; bands with the sprawling 7 minute epic &quot;Ball &amp; Biscuit&quot;.  <br />There isn't anything as commercially accessible as &quot;Fell in Love With a Girl&quot; or &quot;Hotel Yorba&quot; (with the obvious exception of the band's excellent cover of Bacharach's &quot;I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself&quot;) but this isn't a bad thing at all.  <br />&quot;Hypnotize&quot; is a compact bluesy punk rocker that will fit nicely into the band's killer live set, but the main highlights of the album are the songs that may not find a place in the band's live act because of the addition of instrumentation and more intricate arrangements.  The first single &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; swaggers with a funky bass riff undercut by Jack's complimentary lightning guitar lead.  The closer &quot;It's True That We Love One Another&quot; (done with a female British vocalist) combines a hillbilly melody with an interesting and funny lyric.<br />Every song on this album is solid and enjoyable.  It will be sure to end up on many a year-end best list.<br />Run out and buy it now!
0553108034|5.0|Don't buy this book if you're looking for a self-contained story, because you will be disappointed.  If, however, you're looking to read a marvelously intricate, well-characterized yarn that breaks the mold of contemporary fantasy, then buy the first volume, &quot;A Game of Thrones,&quot; and then come back and buy &quot;A Clash of Kings.&quot;  Follow that up with &quot;A Storm of Swords,&quot; and you're halfway through George R. R. Martin's epic masterwork.<br />Martin presents a compellingly realistic world, true to its medieval flavor.  It is dark without being gritty, and despite the labyrinthine plot, it never feels unbalanced.  This volume has greater depth than its predecessor, a state of affairs that I doubt will change as the series progresses.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I'd have to say that my appreciation of pachiderms began around 1992, when I was alone with my thoughts while casually viewing a well-known teevee program that focused on these big and tall creatures.  The subject, one Giblet, was alone in the jungle, abandoned by her family and friends and there went my heart. After donating to various elephantine charities and the Dial-A-Tusk Foundation, I realized that these beasts and their sentimental pandering were breaking my back financially. At that point, I began a correspondence with Sir Marlon Fitzhume of Great Britain, a tired animal researcher and butterfly collector. He revealed to me the very real conspiracy behind the facade. Elephants, as well as horses and several other massive animals, control a vast entertainment empire, and starting with the advent of photography and motion pictures, have managed to present themselves as victims of mankind and like weepy and burdened and whatnot. When in fact, these elephants spend their time touring and performing and being paid the big bucks just to shake some tail for us gullible bipeds. Well, I take it all back. This here new Elephant disc more than makes up for their .....! 5 stars bigod! 5 grey big stars!
B00008H2LE|5.0|For awhile wondering if Linkin Park would be able to release an album that would live up to their fame. Yet, confident something worth while was in the making, I am very pleased with Meteora. For anyone who has been a fan of their previous work of art, they'll love this one and find it hard to stop playing it. The lyrics, I believe are relatable to many people out there. Hey, it's becoming a sell out in many areas. WASTE OF MONEY IT IS NOT!!!!!! Wondering if you should buy the album with DVD? I liked, so have those I've shown it to. A half hour on the making of the album, I'm not the least displeased that I purchased it.
B00000K0DT|5.0|I'm extremely picky about movies and music.  I don't like much,<BR>and what I do like is movies like this one.  It's nothing<BR>specific about this movie that makes it my favorite.  It's the<BR>whole package.  I believe this is the best combination of<BR>acting, dialogue, cinematography, and plot ever put together<BR>in a single film.  Many will disagree.  It's not something that<BR>I will argue about.  Watch this movie.  It will either be one<BR>of your favorites or you won't like it at all.  I can't predict<BR>the outcome for you, but this will probably always be my pick for<BR>#1 movie of all time.
630018403X|4.0|The reason I am giving this movie 4 stars, is I don't get why this movie was named The Breakfast Club, when the movie has nothing to do with breakfast, and there is no club that goes out to breakfast. Maybe that 5 students has to meet at 7:00 for a 9 hour dention. Then why didn't they call this The Dention Club instead of The Breakfast Club? As the movie opens, 5 students report to school for a dention. The staff member (Paul Gleason) in charge gives a 1,000 word essay on who the students think they are. They all have diffrent personality traits. There is a princess (Molly Ringwald), a brain (Anothony Michael Hall), a jock (Emilio Estevez), a criminal (Judd Nelson), and the weird one (Ally Sheedy). The criminal steals a screw and closes the doors of the dention room that angries the staff member who has to spend the time in school in his office next to the dention room, and instead of working on the eassy, they spend thier time talking expect for the weird one. This is a great movie to watch if you love teen movies, but this movie has a R rating for lanuage and I'm not sure if it rated R for anything else. This is also a must watch if you are a big fan of teen movies, or if you are a fan of one more more of the cast members. But this movie could have also been called the lunch club. But this more doesn't have a lot of characters, I say the movie has about 10 characters, and the 5 main characters are spending a Saturday in dentention. And there is a narrator's voice in this movie. I think ths movie should not have been called the Breakfast Club. Because this movie has nothing to do with breakfast.
0385504209|4.0|This has to be one of the most unusual and fascinating mystery novels!  At times it is thought provoking; at other times, it is reads like a junior high adventure story, but it always makes the reader go on to just one more chapter.  The mixture of art, religious symbolism, paganism, and secret societies is fascinating.  Although to some, this may appear as anti-Catholic, I didn't find it so, but felt that a respect for real faith in a loving God came through.  The situations are bizarre and contrived, but this truly fictional book caused me to think about how much we don't understand, and that the road to how we got to where we are as modern day \\"religious\\" people has never been straight.  This book made me shake my head and smile and think of Shakespeare's line:  \\"Lord, what fools these mortals be [and have been]\\"  Read it for what it's worth, nothing more, but if you want a real page-turner with some interesting historical minutiae, do read it.
B00008BXJF|5.0|-a very inspired, fresh sounding collection of mellow and loud music<BR>-now I know why Adrian smiles so much.<BR>-go get'um Trey!
B000002UB3|5.0|What more can be said? Although originally released in 1969, this album was recorded after Let It Be, which was released in 1970. The play list for this album reads like a greatest hits compilation: Something (Frank Sinatra called it the greatest love song ever written), Come Together, Maxwell's Silver Hammer, Octopus's Garden, Oh! Darlin, Here Comes the Sun, You Never Give Me Your Money, She Came In Through the Bathroom Window, Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight, and The End. You don't need to be a Beatles fan to enjoy this one!
0345404475|4.0|Philip Dick is known to everyone these days, but some of his best work is actually unknown. This book is great, but I found it less intriguing than his short stories. Dick himself once said that he doesn't like novels because they don't cut to the chase. Having said that, some of the best moments in this novel are when the protagonist (Deckard) chases his bounty and at some point does not know whether to kill them or not. He is torn knowing that they are so close to being human, that they could actually be, if only they dreamt of electric sheep.<br />Dick's plot machinations are great, and he proves it time and again here. There is a sudden shift in the plot which shakes you up and makes you read the book more carefully. Amazing writer who comes up with sci-fi terms (not acronyms, but cool sounding words like precogs, conapt, vidscreen, inertial, teep) like they are in some candy jar in his attic. Witty in a dry sort of way (when Deckard and his wife discuss what mood they should choose from the mood organ) and profound when he wants to be.<br />PKD has given me a renewed love for Science Fiction. Definitely for the more paranoid among us.<br />I recommend it heartily.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album-Aptly named for its cover, this was the Beatles only double album (greatest hits compilations notwithstanding). This album contains some of the Fab Four's most diverse work, with solid contributions by all four. From straight-ahead, no brains rockers like Helter Skelter, Birthday and Back In the USSR, to pop tunes like Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, Rocky Raccoon and While My Guitar Gently Weeps, to tender ballads like Dear Prudence, Julia and Cry Baby, Cry, and others that defy categorization, this album is a classic that belongs in every Beatles fan's collection.
B000084T18|1.0|Lots of hype, not many words.  Pretty prosaic in my opinion.  We all know ground, crown, and down rhyme; let's hear some ill connectors.  Perhaps it doesn't work with his gun lyrics, but there are a few rappers who spit the gun talk with style.  Not for those looking for lyrical creativity.  Not hatin', just keepin' the mind elevated.
B000002UDB|5.0|Not a B-side track on this gem, this album contains two tracks that were recorded during the Sgt. Pepper's session but held off for this one-Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields Forever. Other notable tracks include The Fool On the Hill, I Am the Walrus, Hello Goodbye, Baby You're a Rich Man and All You Need Is Love. Ahead of its time, it remains a classic today.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I never really thought I'd be interested in russian music, or even bands! But Tatu is phenomenal. They are the greatest. They're cd has a mix of both english and russian songs. It helps to understand also. &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; is definately one of the best, out of many others. With their new single &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; On The Radio, they're bound to be loved! <BR>It's a great cd.. I definately don't regret buying it. Actually got me into alot of other russian bands; Demo, Mummi Troll and Hi-Fi.
B000002UAU|5.0|Recorded during the height of their experimental studio recordings, many consider this album, now nearing its 40th anniversary, to be one of the most influential of all time. From the title track to Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds, When I'm 64, Lovely Rita, and the classic Day In the Life, many of the tracks on this album sound as fresh today as they did back in 1967.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a fantastic cd and marks a very cool event in modern rock music!  Finally, a band of this music style (no, it is not a &quot;new style&quot; - read on) makes it popular on mainstream media.  EVANESCENCE are as good as, and are doing what European female-lead goth/metal bands such as THE GATHERING, TRISTIANA, WITHIN TEMPTATION, LACUNA COIL, THEATRE OF TRAGEDY, SINS OF THY BELOVED, and NIGHTWISH have been doing underground for years.  For all you fans of EVANESCENCE - welcome to our world!  There is a lot to experience in this genre, enjoy.
B000083E79|3.0|Cher is incredible, let's get that out of the way. And I was initially excited about this cd, then the more I heard about it, the less excited I got.<br />First off, there are obvious omissions: where is &quot;WE ALL SLEEP ALONE&quot; and &quot;LOVE &amp; UNDERSTANDING&quot;? I feel these two belong here more than &quot;ALL OR NOTHING&quot; and &quot;A DIFFERNT KIND OF LOVE SONG&quot;.<br />Secondly, there have been 1000's of Cher photos taken over the years. I would have rather had a booklet crammed with photos instead of Kurt Loder's essay. Instead we get about 6 photos.<br />Thirdly, the single mixes of &quot;HEART OF STONE&quot; &amp;  &quot;ALL OR NOTHING&quot; should have been the ones included.
0380820846|3.0|Eversince the Duke and I, I've become an avid fan of Julia Quinn.  I've read almost all of her books and all are not only romantic but full of laughs as well.  She is definitely witty and knows how to weave magical stories.   However....<br />Romancing Mr. Bridgerton is the 4th installment of Julia Quinn's-The Bridgerton series.  This may be my least favorite out of the four but mind you, it still merits 3 stars as it was an entertaining read.   I noticed that Ms. Quinn didn't waste time retelling or even summarizing the previous book on this series.  She updates you with the previous characters, and even uses them as secondary characters but none of those \\"skipping-pages-bec-i-know-this-part-already\\" on this book series.  In fact, you can pretty much read these books as an  individual without feeling lost.  But I still suggest you read the whole series for an add-on smile on your face when you read the updates...<br />I will not rehash the plot or the story anymore as most have already done it.  I will just add that however entertaining this book may be, I find the romance between the H & H a little too light.  I also find Colin's character lacking.   I guess I wanted him to be the bold one in this story.  Seems to me that Penelope sorta overshadowed him a little bit (and to think she was a wallflower!).  He does show his manliness in some areas but I still feel a little unsatisfied.  On the outside, Colin was an adventurer, carefree and playful but inside, he was filled with insecurities.  Uncertain about himself...  He hid himself by smiling coolly or playing the smoothie.  Penelope however is an almost true-to-life character.  Not very pretty, not so fashionable, not so rich and in fact a \\"wallflower\\" for so many years.  But she compensated her imperfections with her intelligence.  That I like.  And her intelligence is what captivated Colin.  That I like too.  None of those superficial physical love-at-first-sight here, that's for sure.  I also liked the idea ofPenelope learning more about herself and what she can actually be.  Sometimes, it takes TIME and another person to encourage us to be who we can be.  So the beauty of this book is that both Colin and Penelope benefited each other by filling the hole on each other's soul and personality.  I also do like friendship-first in my romance books but in this instance, the frienship-love-story was somewhat slow in the beginning.  I'm also still skeptical as to how the love suddenly came in to both of them.  Maybe not so much to Penelope because  I know she always had her heart for Colin but Colin's love seems too fast to have happened.  There wasn't any challenge in their love story either.  A little effort on Colin's part in pursuing Penelope would be nice.  I wished my heart skipped a beat once in awhile while I read on but it didn't.  Even the marriage proposal was too facile.  Colin and Penelope romance just didn't soar my heart.  <br />The revelation of Lady Whistledown was a complete surprise to me.  Some people told me that they knew from the previous book who L.W. is... My, I didn't know!  Didn't even know who it was until 1/2 of this book.  I must say, It's not who or what I expected.   I have to read The Duke and I, Viscount Who Love Me & An Offer From A Gentleman all over again...  I want to see which clues have I missed.   I would have given this book a 3 1/2 stars if I could. Overall, this book is entertaining though definitely not Ms. Quinn's best.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki has done it again!  A story that keeps you glued to every moment. A fine mixture of mystery, comedy, love, adventure, greed... in a BEAUTIFULLY animated whole.  Chihiro is a most delightful young heroin.  This film has everything to keep you interested - monsters, cute \\"dust balls\\", gold, dragons, pigs, spirits, magic, big-headed ladies, and giant babies! Highly recommended!!!
B00005QG9J|5.0|this is one of my favorite cds in my collections.  Incubus definately reinvented themselfs again in Morning View.  ORDER IT!!
B000002UTY|5.0|It's been said that QMS is San Fransico's cowboys to the Grateful Dead's indians. This recording by far must be Quicksilver's finest moments. If it's a \\"greatest hits\\" album you're looking for, this isn't for you. This live recording is pure acid rock jamming epitomizing the Haight sound. Cipollina's hard driving, eerie guitar licks and hauntingly powerful voice take you on a psychedelic roller coaster ride to hell and back!!! It's got a good beat, you can dance to it.... I give it a nine (lol)!!! A must have for any classic rock collector!!!
B00003CXSP|2.0|This is a radically different film from Silence of the Lambs. Not just the look, but Hannibal, who just doesn't seem as dangerous now that he is not behind bars. When we watched Silence of the Lambs, we did not see what Hannibal did, but rather heard about it, like a legend. This is what made Hannibal such a lovable villain, not what he did on screen, but rather what he is capable of. <br />I would not say Hannibal is a total disaster because it really isn't. Fans of Hannibal Lecter should consider seeing this film despite the critics' disapproval. I enjoyed the sleeky feel of the film and Ridley's visual genius that comes into play. One scene begins the film with doves forming Hannibal's face on the ground. This film does not have much suspense, but reverts to gore and violence (ugh, the brain scene was unnecessary). <br />Poor Ray Liotta, I'll never see him as anything more than the guy that ate his own brain for a meal. This is not surprising as it is shocking. Having read the book (somewhat of a disaster) I'm glad that Ridley Scott did not incorporate that ending. This is not a terrible film, I gave it two stars compared to the Silence of the Lambs. Fans of this series should check out Red Dragon, an excellent prequel.
B00000HZFP|5.0|I love this cd. I really don't know what else to say. Buy it. You will not regret it.
B00008972S|5.0|The packaging is a keepsake-the documentary wonderful...this DVD is a must for those who own Sound of music SE...even though not as much info. as the criterion Laser Disc, this is just tremendous!!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|Ok firstly this is NOT moulin rouge , Chicago is a stage show 30 years old with all original music written by the masters of musical Kander and Ebb , Moulin Rouge uses old pop songs , Please to the coupld of previous posts trying to compare it to moulin rouge get your facts straight please.
B00008AY3L|5.0|If you listen to any review that says this record isnt good, or hes sold out.  Please ignore them.  PLEASE!!  <BR>  This CD is wonderful.  It has funk, groove, and a quiet beauty.  I have no problem if you like another one of his CD's better, but this one is quite amazing.<BR>   I wont review it by song, or by anything but what type of person will enjoy this CD.  If you like the groove, youll like this CD.  If you like the groove, but also have sensitive side to you and enjoy quiet, yet personal and &quot;pretty&quot; music you will LOVE this album.  If your judgemental and believe an artist doesnt have the right to keep his work from being shared freely and easily over the internet, you will dislike this CD, as you actually had to pay for it..Notice he is #18 on the top 100, I bet he would be nowhere near that had he not protected his CD against MP3 technology. <BR>          So basically if you have some funk in you, have that groove going through your body, can deal with someones deep love of god, even if your not quite there yourself, and love someone who has a great voice and plays a great guitar then this is the perfect CD for you.  14 songs, 11 great songs.  How many CD's can say that???  Enjoy Ben and to all who gave him a bad review above, Im glad I dont have to listen to your CD collection.  Its probably filled of High rated CD's by Rolling Stone and other sites that just have this thing against the groove....Play it, sit back, stand up, dance and enjoy!!..
0671042858|4.0|Well I must say after my last book (1000 pages and void of any real content - Elizabeth George &quot;Traitor to Memory&quot; DONT BUY IT) this was just wonderful! Short, sweet, definitely to the point, and it keeps you interested! I loved the little girl's attitude throughout all the nasty little things happening to her. Definitely a good and quick read. It's worth your time!
0684823454|4.0|Churchill presents us with a short and lively account of his early life, making this one of his more accessible works.<br />We see it all: nanny-pampered, mother-neglected child; dim-witted schoolboy but top-notch military student; officer and reporter. In fact as a reporter in the Boer war, he worked as what we are calling today (during the Iraqi war) an embedded reporter. So deeply embedded that the Boers made him a POW though he was a non-combatant.<br />My favourite chapters deal with his schooling. He laughs at himself, poking fun at his younger self's total ineptitude at subjects such as Latin and mathematics, all the while humbly pointing out that he became such a good writer because being perceived as such a dolt by his teaches, the only thing they'd bother teaching him was English.<br />The accounts of his military life are interesting but are today overshadowed by the first and second world wars, so that I was unfamiliar with the background that led to conflicts in the Soudan or against the Boer. I recommend reading up on the Boer War in a good enclyclopedia.<br />Througout the book, WSC displays wit and irony. WSC reminds his readers that following the Boer War, the public thought that no more wars would be fought among white people (don't ever expect WSC to be P.C.--he calls a spade a spade) and that World War One came along anyway. Since he was writing before WW2, the intent was clearly to wake his countrymen up to the possibility of future conflict.<br />Recommended.
0385484518|5.0|This was a touching story. It is not very often that you get a reality check like this one. The book highlights on sensitive topics such as death and dying and incorporates the importance of friends, family, and love. It is a great teaching tool. I give this book an A+.
0812550757|2.0|ENDER'S GAME was gripping and it recaptured the feelings of childhood for me. But SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD was disappointing: the plot is slow, the characters are boring, the premise is unbelievable, and the philosophy is pretentious.<br />The most exciting moment in this book occurs when a small child urinates on the protagonist!
156895557X|5.0|This books emphasizes the importance of friends, family, and love. It is these life lessons that we often miss in our busy lives.
B00003CXRP|5.0|It is a beautifully photographed story, drawing out the unforgiving beauty of the island in all its moods. The photography also draws the viewer into the story by including items in the frame that the viewer is allowed to discover. Sometimes we see them before Chuck (such as the nighttime passing ship on the horizon), sometimes we see things at the same moment as Chuck. One striking scene is when Chuck first ascends to the top of the island and through the panoramic scene we share his discovery that he is alone and there is no other land on the horizon. Now that I have seen the extra features unavailable in the theater, I have an even greater appreciation for how the cinematographer achieved this. It is clear from the extra feature that there actually was another island quite close by, but the cinematographer was able to do a very wide angle shot from the top of the mountain giving the feeling of absolute isolation and still hide the fact that in reality there was another island right behind the actor.<br />It is a terrific acting job by Tom Hanks. He carries a tremendous load in this movie. For nearly two hours he is the only person in the movie. His demonstration of the many stages his character experiences is convincing. He portrays manic devotion to the job, fear, frustration, depression, elation, disappointment, resignation and contented hope.<br />The score and audio are wonderfully understated. During the whole island inhabitation there is no music. All one hears is the quiet sounds of the desert island. We finally hear some quiet but stirring music as Hanks escapes the island, and it is so expressive of the relief and freedom he must be feeling because we are experiencing it with him.<br />It is a well written story of human transformation. At the beginning of the story we meet Chuck, the Fed Ex legend, devoted to his job and the clock. Over two hours (or several years) later, we leave Chuck knowing a completely different man who has had his life and priorities totally rearranged. Some of this is forced on him by his experience. But his hopefulness at the end is a response of his own choice. The viewers experienced the process with him, and we leave the story with our own opportunities for reflection and hope.<br />To my memory, this movie didn't win very many major awards. I know Hanks received the Golden Globe for his acting, but I think that's it. I believe the film deserved more. I suppose it is either a tribute to the competition that year, or a shame on judges who prefer more standard Hollywood fare.
0375703861|3.0|I thought this book was more medicore than terrific. Smith is all over the place, with long stretches of commentary and a plot that goes nowhere. The most interesting characters are those from Bangladesh but all the characters from Jamaica seem like caricatures. The book really needs editing and I think if this would not have been a first novel, and author was not so young, the book would not have recieved half the praise it did.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Even if you already own the Beatles Anthology on VHS, the bonus material alone is worth the price of the DVD collection.  The 'Real Love' video has been revamped since the television broadcast and is included along with candid outakes from the original documentary.  The picture and sound quality makes it a whole new experience.
B00008CLOA|5.0|OK, this is one of THE best albums EVER recorded, and the Guiness Book Of World Records can prove it. Now that it's been 30 years (I can't believe it) since it first hit, the producer's have decided to remix this wonderful album in all of it's 5.1 channel surround glory. Having heard the quad mix once before, I could not wait to hear this album in 5.1, but I was sad to see that is was going to be released by SONY under it's SACD (Super Audio CD) format, and not the ever popular DVD-Audio format. Now I realize that Sony is trying to push this format off the ground, but seriously, how many of us out there have SACD players? (I guess I gotta get one now) The only saving grace they have is that this disc is a &quot;Hybrid&quot; disc, and can be played on your regular analogue CD players, albeit simply in a new remastered 2-channel stereo mix (which is, by the way, better than the 20th anniversary, and the Shine On box set release). So , if you wanna hear this amazing mix, you have an SACD player to truly enjoy it's full potential. If you are looking for a terrific sounding album that would still blow away ANY of Rock's recent album mixes, pick this one up!<br />I also just have one beef though...couldn't it have been released in DVD-Audio format as well, so I could enjoy the 5.1 surround mix NOW?!?!?
B000084T18|4.0|50 cent is on his way to be a great rapper. (not spectacular, but great). he's got all the tools, the production company, and the connections with the most consistently awesome rapper right now, eminem. this cd is nowhere compared to illmatic or ready to die or cuban links but it is slightly below. i hoped dre would get on a track or two, but oh well he isnt on the cd. however, lloyd banks from g unit tears up the joint and i cant wait till he puts out a cd of his. imma go on a track by track breakdown of the cd...<br />1) intro - just 2 quarters droppin on a table (hence 50 cent)<BR>2) What up Gangsta - alright song kinda gets overshadowed by the following songs<BR>3) Patiently Waiting - a sick song b/c eminem's lyrics are totally sick, 50 needs some help on this track<BR>4) Many Men (wish death) - tight song with a sick hook, gets in ur head very easily, this is a song about him gettin shot<BR>5) In Da Club - im sure uve heard this song by now<BR>6) High All the time - at first i skipped over this song but after hearing it a couple times its sick<BR>7) Heat - skip over it<BR>8) If i can't - a tight song with a tight beat and hook <BR>9) Blood Hound - introduces young buck of g unit, tight flow<BR>10) Back down - watch out Ja, 50's gon get u. song's a ja diss, tightness<BR>11) P.I.M.P. - this songs been on the radio's a lil so im sure uve heard it, its tight, kinda mainstream tho<BR>12) Like my Style feat tony yayo - yayo is tight but the song is kinna lacking<BR>13) Poor Lil Rich - boring song skip over it<BR>14) 21 questions - at first when i saw that nate dogg was on this song i was like sickkk its gotta be good, i hated it the first few times i heard it, but after a while u grow to like it.<BR>its a love song<BR>15) Dont Push Me - arguably the best song on the cd with eminem and lloyd banks, great great great great song. buy this cd just for this song<BR>16) Gotta make it to heaven - an alright song, nuthin bad, nuthin good<BR>BONUS CUTS<BR>17) Wanksta - yeah im sure u heard this by now<BR>18) U Not like me - one of my favorite songs, with tight rhymes<BR>19) Life's on the line - another good song<br />Overall, i give this cd a 4 because its not classic but it is good.
B000021YQV|3.0|the only good songs are prion song, chop-suey,science, and shimmy. If you like soad get the self titled one.(the hand) not this. Even the rejects( stel this album) were better.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Of course, having just purchased these DVD's a few hours ago and spending every minute with them since, I am very impressed at the surround sound (and the video). I am no expert on surround (but would say on hi-fi stereo in general) by any stretch of the imagination, but hearing some of these tunes in DTS surround is a revelation. Apparently, by viewing the end of the credits, the whole series has been re-mixed for 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital. It certainly begs the question of all Beatle albums being released in DVD-A or SACD. We'll all be buying Beatles albums in some new format well into our retirement, I suppose. The new extras are great to see, especially the production team interviews, and what I really was looking for in this purchase since I already have the VHS version. Of course, the convenience of not having to fast forward and rewind the tape  is wonderful, also. Another point: when the VHS version was purchased, we all didn't have our television video hooked up with component video cables and digital audio cables. That makes a great difference. Great picture, great sound. Plus extras. Great deal. Now, when is Let It Be being re-released on DVD.

B000002GK1|5.0|This album is just pure rock at it's finest.  Chris Cornell's voice is at is peak of range and clarity, Matt Cameron's drumming is classic, and the overall feel of the album is incredible.  This is Soundgarden at the height of their heaviness.  As time went on they refined their sound a bit more, but this album still shines.<br />Standout tracks like &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, &quot;Searching With My Good Eye Closed&quot; and &quot;Mind Riot&quot; are nothing short of classics. This is a must-own CD for any hard rock/metal fan.
B00005PJ6M|5.0|I really didn't think Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey was gonna be as good as Excellent Adventure, but it was! I rented it at my friend's house, and then I rented it again the next day when I came home, that's how good it was. I think it's worth it just to see the few parts with Good Bill & Ted talking to Evil Bill & Ted... and maybe the part where Evil Bill throws some junk food at himself. I crack up every time. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are both most excellent in this movie, and are also most triumphant as Evil Bill & Ted. Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey was MOST unprecedented. I totally recommend it, dude!
B000089RVX|5.0|After seeing the movie DareDevil and ended up thinking Evanescence made that movie. I went online and listened to some of the other tracks and I was hooked. This is amazing Cd every song has you wanting more. Amy voice is nothing like I've ever heard, she got such real talent. I'm so sick of rap and all that junk that this cd made me want to listen and listen to more of this amzing band.

I originally only watch it 'cause of SMG(Big Fan)<BR>And when I started watching it, and not quite her as much, I really enjoyed it! For Sarah Gellar  more comonly known as \\"Buffy, from Buffy:The vampire Slayer\\" and as a good-girl role and to stretch into such an uber-bad girl role was really good. I actually believed her! I knew that she was  better than Pam Anderson(thank God!!) (You know, it doesn't take much to be better than her) Just the acting itself is amazing. I meen C'mon<BR> Reese Whitherspoon,Ryan Phillippe,Swoozie Kurtz, Tara Ried,Sean Patrick Thomas,Selma Blair! The stars alone make \\"Cruel Intentions\\" a great film.

B000067IZ3|5.0|Fans of absorbing dramas such as &quot;JFK&quot; and and &quot;The Conversation&quot; rejoice!  As I write this it is March of 2003 and I have yet to watch a truly great movie this year.  And then I rented &quot;Traffic.&quot;  This is a great, riveting film which avoids almost all the trappings and conventions of film that I have come to hate (Douglas' &quot;I can't do this&quot; speech being the exception).  And for once here is a movie that's thought provoking without being obvious (the antithesis of &quot;John Q&quot;). If you like the films of Soderbergh, Oliver Stone, or Michael Mann, I promise you will enjoy &quot;Traffic.&quot;  If you don't, email me and ream me out. . .
B00005JKN9|4.0|I think Roger Ebert said it best, that this is not the film that director Martin Scorsese was born to make.  (We all know that \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" was the one.)  But to my eyes, it certainly looks like a Scorsese film.  He is simply the greatest director for cinema of all time.  And among the greatest cinematographers, Michael Ballhaus, is back on the scene here (after \\"The Age of Innocence\\"); other critics are correct to call this film \\"operatic,\\" and much of this is due to Ballhaus' contribution.  (Robert Richardson gave us more of a trip-hop, post-representational vibe in Scorsese's other recent film, \\"Bringing Out the Dead.\\")<br />The only point of criticism is admittedly rude, but let's face it:  Scorsese is getting old, and what was once hip in his Mean Streets is now pretty much corny.  First of all, he should have hired his stalwart scorer, Elmer Bernstein, or an equivalent.  The '90s techno soundtrack that \\"underscored\\" the first fight scene was plainly silly.  And the whining ballad of U2, juxtaposed against the World Trade Center, was as graceful as the endings of Schindler's List and Malcolm X -- insultingly pedantic and convenient.<br />As has been noted, history may treat this film well, though I wonder what this notion means in a world where film study today consists of DVD binges at Best Buy by middle-aged suburbanites.  Very few of us have access to repertory houses; in short, \\"Gangs of New York\\" was a phenomenal film when it was in theatres and most everyone missed it -- the experience, the point.
B00008977N|4.0|Man am I glad I didn't let the negative reviews talk me out of grabbing this concert dvd.  Even if there was NO video the DTS 5.1 sound would be worth the price alone.  Too many current concert dvds use the rears for mostly audience ambience and not for music.  This disc uses all 5 speakers to the max with each having their own discreet sounds, truly one of the best sounding concert dvds I have heard.  The video is not on par with a brand new movie but on my sony that squeezes the picture with it's anamorphic capabilities it is certainly adequate.  If you are a Gabriel fan don't let this one pass you by, you will love it.
0066214122|3.0|&quot;Prey&quot; is Michael Crichton's latest techno-thriller with the emphasis on the technology at the expense of the thrills.  Granted, I am somebody who never took Biology let along Chemistry or Physics in high school so my ability to assimilate scientific information gets maxed out at the level of &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;  I understand the &quot;what ifs&quot; of finding dinosaur DNA and filling the gaps with sequences from frogs.  But Crichton quickly leaves me in the dust in this novel.<br />After an introduction entitled &quot;Artifical Evolution in the Twenty-first Century,&quot; which made me nervous that there might be some sort of quiz at the back of the book, we are given a glimpse at the end of the story before going back to the beginning: &quot;Day 1, 10:04 A.M.&quot;  Our hero is Jack Forman, currently an unintentional househusband but once the overseer of computer programmers attempting to solve problems by mimicking the behavior of predatory animals.  Jack is staying home taking care of the three kids while his wife, Julia, is working lots of long hours at the top secret research labs of Xymos Technology.  Jack is getting suspicious about her behavior (the first thing she does when she gets home is take a shower), but that seems the least of his problems when the baby starts screaming.  Amanda's entire body has turned a bright, angry red despite no sign of fever or infection.  The doctors are totally confounded and Amanda does not stop screaming until she is given an MRI, at which point she returns to normal.<br />This is a book where pretty much everything is connected, but knowing that you are seeing clue after clue paraded before your eyes is not going to do you much help in figuring out the mystery that confronts Jack.  Crichton is telling the story in a first person voice and Jack constantly has to interrupt the narrative to explain the science involved in a particular plot point.  Julia's company is doing something with self-replicating nano-technology, but whatever they are doing is getting way out of hand.  Jack is called in as a consultant at factory in the Nevada desert to do some trouble-shooting, but quickly learns that nobody is telling him the complete truth or giving him the big picture on what is happening.<br />The more you know about science in general and nano-technology in particular (aside from the relevant episdoes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;) the more you are going to enjoy &quot;Prey&quot; for the simple reason that you will be able to understand what is going on a whole lot better than the rest of us.  My gut instinct is that there is a point where the evolutionary growth of the little monsters becomes far-fetched, but I have little chance of knowing that for sure, let along of convincing anybody else.  &quot;Prey&quot; was a book that I did not want to put down simply because I was going to have a hard time remembering all the technological aspects about what was going on when I picked the novel back up.  I pity the writer who has to turn \\"Prey\\" into a film script because unless they figure out how to provide footnotes during the film audiences are going to have trouble understanding what is happening on a scientific level.nano-technology, but whatever they are doing is getting way out of hand.

6302038308|5.0|It's about time I wrote a review for this movie.  It's one of my favorite films of all time; part 2 of the violent, scary and often hilarious Evil Dead trilogy.  I guess I just didn't know what to write.  I have read many reviews of this film from fans who insist that it isn't a remake of the first film in the series, and I am about as big an Evil Dead fan as they come, but this films has too much in common with the first to be considered a sequel.  <BR>  That is not to say in the least, however, that Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn is not equally as good a movie as the other two in the series.  Infact, many people believe that it is superior to The Evil Dead and Army of Darkness.  I like them all the same, and don't feel they should be compared because, whether or not Evil Dead 2 is a remake of the first, they are all their own film.<BR>  Regardless of whether or not Evil Dead 2 is a sequel or not, it starts off with Ash (our hero) returning to the doomed cabin he barely escaped in the first film and there is no explanation for this.  So, in that respect, it is a sequel.  Many of the same events from the first movie occur, although are done a bit differently, and instead of teens we have a new cast of characters.  Director Sam Raimi obviously knew what kind of movie he was making, and made the story the way he did fro a reason.  The same sort of thing happens in the beginning of Army of Darkness; there is a change in the story, and the ending of Evil Dead 2.<BR>  But anyway, instead of straightforward gory horror, Evil Dead 2 starts to shift towards slapstick, gross-out comedy, which the series perfects with Army of Darkness.  When Bruce Campbell battles himself in the kitchen it is a moment of true physical acting mastery.<BR>  Like all of Sam Raimi's older films, he is not afraid to use cheesy special effects if it means getting the shot he's after, and this shows in Evil Dead 2, (although the effects weren't that cheesy when the movie was originally released.)  <BR>Anyway, it's a must for horror fans.  Very funny.
6305291446|4.0|It is rather amazing that the reputation of the original \\"Halloween\\" has not been tarnished by all the sequels that have come down the road in the last quarter century.  Whatever eloquence the first film had was replaced by as much explicit bloodletting as possible in \\"Halloween 2\\" and the fun has been continuing ever since.  \\"Halloween: H20\\" is an attempt, of sorts, to get the series back on track.  The idea is that the fourth, fifth and sixth films in the series never happened and we are now twenty years after the original bloodletting in the first two films.  Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is back, all grown up with her own teenage son, only now she is running a private boarding school and calling herself Keri Tate.  This is not just because she is trying to escape the notoriety of being the sister of Michael Myers but also because she knows deep down inside that her brother is still out there somewhere trying to kill her.  Of course she is right; just do not ask what he has been doing for two decades, wandering around the country wearing that William Shatner mask painted white.<br />From a historical perspective \\"Halloween\\" was the first film where the slasher kept getting up every time he was put down.  Hard to believe that once upon a time this was a \\"new\\" idea, because certainly it has been done to death (pardon the phrase).  We are actually at the point where we are surprised in a film where the killer is killed and is actually dead.  The killer who cannot die has become such a commonplace it has gone well beyond the slasher genre.  What this means is that by the time we get to this film there is nothing new regarding his ability to survive knife slashes, blows from an ax, a rock being pounded on his skull, and other substantive physical assaults.  We have seen it all before and whether the slasher's name is Michael Myers, Jason, or whatever, it does not matter anymore.<br />That means the success of this film has a lot more to Laurie's end of the story than Michael's, and in that is the regard in which this film falls short.  It is made clear that Laurie has been thinking about this day (okay, this night; he always comes out at night) for two decades.  Given that she is running a private school (and recalling her answer regarding fate in her English class back in 1978) we also know that this is a smart person.  Surely in all that time she has come up with hundreds of plans on how she will stop her brother from driving a big knife into her body.  I mean, come on, remember what Nancy was able to put together in one night for Freddy Krueger.  Laurie Strode cannot do better?  Sigh.  Jamie Leigh Curtis deserved a better script than this for coming back and lending her considerable cache to the series that made her the original Scream Queen.  Just go back and watch the original to remember what made this stuff work in the first place.<br />Final comment: Did you ever thing that Janet Leigh's car in \\"Psycho\\" had blue tones?  That sure surprised me.than Michael's, and in that is the regard in which this film falls short.

B00003CXXM|5.0|This is certainly an old genre, but the movie turns out good. Although somewhat predictable, it has a much more realistic angle that most films of this type forget. We have a talented professional who forgets it all, which would be a blessing to many in the field, but who shows that what most of us really want (besides freedom) is to know ourselves and to be loved. This film provides both and does it at a good pace.
B000002RXS|3.0|This has got to be one of the worst records with Maria Callas. There is an intrusive wobble in the whole register which makes listening a pain. Gedda who made 3 studio recordings with her later recalled that at this stage she sang as if she had a potato in her mouth. He was right and I cannot think of any other singer who would have been allowed recording in such bad voice. But Callas will always sell...<br />Pretre's conducting is sluggish - not at all a match for Beecham, Cluytens, Karajan or Abbado. He is simply not able to hold the ensemble together with the required firm hand.<br />Are there any redeeming features? Yes, indeed, Gedda himself is stylish as always and Guiot is a vulnerable and very moving Micaela. This just doesn't make a Carmen. Gedda is even heard to greater advantage with Beecham and that in a very atmospheric recording.
0060523794|4.0|Our graduate level class was studying various business models, new and old.  This book is a great example of how a man came into a dying business and transformed its business model.  I know Gerstner has many critics...but the bottom line is...he saved the company.  He did it by reinventing the way IBM did business.  I was very impressed with this book.  It's worth the money.
B000089RVX|5.0|This Cd is just amazing and I dont even like rock music.<br />Going Under 3/5- One of the weaker songs on the cd but still quite good.<br />Bring Me To Life- 4/5 The radio friendly song that is putting them on the chart, quite like a Linkin Park song.<br />Everybody's Fool- 2/5- the least favorite song on the cd.<br />My Immortal 5/5, a slow song, it's only piano and WOW what a song, the lyrics are amazing. Amy Lee did a great job on this track. If you have a love in your life this song may remind you of them.<br />Haunted- 5/5, Are you kidding me? This song is, it's hard and the lyrics are amazing also.<br />Tourniquet -5/5, Most likley one of the best songs on the cd, another hard hit song. You can tell what she is saying not one of those crazed rock stars.<br />Imaginary- 5/5Probally one of the written songs, this and MY Immortal are the songs that will move you the most.<br />Taking Over Me - 5/5\\"I'll give up everything just to find you\\" a lyric in the song. Another great drum and gutiar rips.<br />Hello- 3/5 Well this song is also another piano song just by Amy Lee. The piano part is nice the the lyrics are a bit odd.<br />My Last Breath- 4/5, Just good could of been better but good, you will get use to it.<br />Whisper- 5/5!, Now this song is the jam!. I mean everything about it is amazing. You have to hear it to know what I mean.<br />Evanescence is a amazing band. I also got their 1st cd, just as good. Some songs on their 1st cd appears on this cd also. It's worth your money to buy this cd. It's not punk, its not rap-metal,its not metal. It's just amazing music that people will like even the 1's that do not like rock music .
B00008MNYS|5.0|Anyone who is familiar with the music of Robbie Williams knows that his music has evolved over time.  And this new record is no different.  &quot;Escapology&quot; captures the true essence of who Robbie Williams is, from the touching lead-off single &quot;Feel&quot; to the Rockin' &quot;How Peculiar&quot;, every base is covered on this record.  As for those of you not to familiar with Mr. Williams, think David Bowie meets Elton John meets Duran Duran meets Queen meets Frank Sanatra meets Aerosmith.  His music is as diverse as it is fantastic, so please rush out and pick up &quot;Escapology&quot; and tell your friends about it.
B00004VXF2|4.0|This is the only recording of Lou Reed's that I actually think is worth something. And I love John Coltrane's Giant Steps (and I like Coltrane's Meditations even more).<br />But if you want to hear something really whacky, listen to Communications 11 by Mike Mantler, JCOA and Cecil Taylor, John Cage and David Tudor's Cartridge Music, or even Alan Silva's Celestrial Communications Orhestra or Peter Brotzmann's Machine Gun or the Borbetomagus CD's. Lou Reed ain't nuthin compared to these...<br />Happy listening...<br />Gary Gomes
B000003TA4|5.0|Most albums, even good ones, that you hear for the first time, you usually don't like every track at first.  It has to grow on you, and eventually you might like every track on the cd.  Nevermind is one of those rare cds, where you will like every track the second you hear it.  It has a great range of songs, from ultra fast; breed, territorial pissings.  To regular fast; smells like teen spirit, lithium.  To slow; polly, something in the way.  There is a lot more variety to it as well.  Everything about this album is great, and you can't stop listening to it.  Even though most albums you buy, even if they are good, you usually will listen to it for a while, then get rid of it.  After all these years, I can still listen to it.  Many people don't like Nirvana for different reasons, from his suicide, to his attitude, or just simply because they don't like the music.  You can't deny though, that it did change things in the industry.  Nirvana had something other bands didn't.  I really can't say what it was though.  Many fans believe that In Utero is better, and while it is good, I don't think you can get any better than Nevermind.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is such a great album.  Evanescence blends together a unique blend of hard rock/alternative with a very nice vocal driven lead.  I haven't heard anything quite like this before.  I'm impressed.
B000003TAR|4.0|With out a doubt, this album was completely different than Nevermind.  This cd is not as refined, or as clean sounding as that of Nevermind.  Most fans will tell you that this album is the best Nirvana album, but I think it is second best.  Although the lyrics are quite amazing, the sound doesn't seem to flow the same as Nevermind, and doesn't have the in your face impact either.  Their are some tracks you will like at first, some will have to grow on you.  Once they do, it has the same addictive quality as Nevermind.  One thing it definitely does have, is an incredibly unique sound.  The songs can get pretty crazy, but still remain very catchy.  Probably some of the most stand out tracks are milk it, scentless apprentice, and dumb.  This album also has a wide range of songs, from slow to fast, so you won't get bored.  This is an album where you either love it or don't.  If you are a true Nirvana fan, then you will most likely love it.  So if you are, go get it.
B00006BTCA|2.0|I don't understand why these guys are the subject of so much love and hype.  I got the album and listened to it several times; with the exception of the amazing \\"NYC\\" I couldn't find a single track that I really liked.  The lead singer's voice is irritatingly monotonic and has that weird 80's feel to it that you find in bands like the Cure or even Devo.  The rest of the instrumentation is good, but not striking or, in my opinion, very original.  The style hasn't been done in a while, but that doesn't mean its better than any other music out there today, or better than anything it cops to get that sound.  I'd say, give it a shot and you may like it more than myself (i happen to particularly dislike the kind of vocals they use), but don't think its going to change your life, like Spin or Rolling Stone or other hype machines would lead you to believe.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The album is amazing. Regarding one of the earlier reviews, there is no bass on the album. Everyone should read the interview with them in Mojo magazine it's a very insightful look into the album. Discussing the meaning's behind the songs and also the recording of them. \\"There's No Home for you Here\\" is my favorite song on the album at the moment, but the whole thing is a masterpiece. Anyone that says this doesn't live up to their earlier work should have their head checked. **Just to Clarify to anyone that might be reading this, NO Bass on the album. I've been looking at other reviews and people are like \\"wow the first thing you hear is bass\\" this is not true. People should think before they decide to write something.
B000089CPF|5.0|Calexico is a band that cannot be described to those who have not been exposed - and i won't try it here. the editorial review and other reviews above will do better service.<br />What i do have to say is this: Calexico sounds new on this album. were i to sit down a Calexico newbie and play Spoke and then Feast, i think they would be surprised at the difference between the two.<br />Feast has much more production effort here as compared to past albums. nowhere on this album is the strange and enthralling despair of Bloodflow, the desperation of Removed, this simple Point Vicente or the frantic atmosphere around Sonic Wind. this is a much more polished album, with slick mariachi - a far cry from the kind of music i'd expect to here at the roadside by a local group of players and from past Calexico albums.<br />This album will appeal to a wider audience i think, without leaving behind those of use who use them as a yardstick. There are few bands that measure up to what Calexico has achieved with their music. from Giant Sand and OP8 to Calexico, it's hard to name a duo with a better ear or more musical ability.<br />If you are new to the band, buy this with an older album if only to get a speakerfull of their less flashy and arguably more creative songs (ie Bloodflow, Missing, Slag, The Black Light)
B00000IQW5|5.0|I know that the critics panned \\"Always\\", but I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  Here's a telling sign.  Numerous people have Spielberg movie lists published on Amazon(.com); \\"Always\\" has a customer rating of 4.5 stars.  Of Spielberg's other movies, only two of the Indiana Jones movies have higher ratings.

B00006F83Y|5.0|With their third album, the rock epic, \\"Songs For the Deaf,\\" the Queens of the Stone Age have managed to achieve what maybe only one or two bands per decade manage to do. They have managed to make an album that does the following:<br />A: It shows off its influences, especially Black Sabbath, with pride and accuracy.<BR>B: While doing so, it manages to simultaneously come off as strikingly unique and fresh.<BR>C: It makes a bold statement as a whole, in contrast to albums that are merely a collection of songs.<BR>D: Its music is greatly varied, yet still flows effortlessly.<BR>E: Its level of musicianship and songwriting is nothing short of top-notch.<br />The last album to do all of the above was Radiohead's \\"OK Computer.\\" How's that for perspective?<br />Perhaps the album's greatest virtue, however, is its ability to withstand repeated listenings. Relisten value, if you will. Every time the listener listens to the album, he/she will hear several new things, little things, that they never heard before. This is a testament to the band's amazing ability to write seemingly simple licks and melodies, and then surround them with lush sonic soundscapes, mostly driven by the amazing guitarist/vocalist Josh Homme. (Homme is the founder of Kyuss, the pioneers of the Queens' desert rock sound, also known as stoner rock.) Homme's guitar screams, sludges, cries, lumbers, moans, roars, and intertwines with itself in ways that spellbind the listener. Lovers of tons of loud, warm guitars will find paradise in \\"Songs for the Deaf.\\"<br />Also standing out are Dave Grohl's guest performances on drums. Grohl is quite simply the best drummer in rock today, reminiscent of John Bonham, and his performances on this album are among his finest.<br />The musical moods range from the Tool/Audioslave-like intensity of \\"Millionaire,\\" to the spooky, bouncy rock of \\"No One Knows,\\" to the dark, trippy \\"Song For the Deaf,\\" to the acoustic \\"Mosquito Song.\\"<br />The album stands as a scathing criticism of the average rock radio listener, and the radio stations they listen to. The fake radio announcer at the beginning states, \\"I need a saga. That saga is Songs for the Deaf. You can't even hear it!\\"<br />Funny thing is, a second before he says \\"You can't even hear it,\\" the album's 14th track, \\"Song for the Deaf,\\" is playing in the background very quietly, and will most likely be unnoticable to the average listener on their first listen. Radio listeners are deaf, the Queens assert.<br />Skip forward to \\"Song for the Deaf.\\" Right before the track starts, a sultry woman's voice states, \\"This is something you should bow down to and worship, but you're too stupid to realize yourself. A Song for the Deaf, that is for you.\\"<br />The song then builds up until it explodes with such ferocity that even the deaf can finally hear it, and its message, \\"And I heard not a thing, a mistake not to listen.\\"<br />About 40 seconds pass after the end of the song, and many listeners will likely think the CD is over at this point and change the track. However, out of the middle of nowhere, loud, raucous music accompanied by laughing fades in and out of the silence.  A joke on the deaf listeners who thought it was over.<br />40 more seconds of silence passes, and the dark, yet strangely beautiful, acoustic \\"Mosquito Song\\" arrives. Probably the most musically accomplished song on the album, its \\"hidden\\" place on the record further illustrates itself as a joke on the deaf, along with its somewhat silly lyrics.<br />A huge leap from the nontheless impressive \\"Rated R,\\" \\"Songs For the Deaf\\" stands as an absolute masterpiece for the Queens of the Stone Age, and its importance should not be ignored.
B00008MNYS|4.0|Months after the international version of the CD was released, Escapology arrives in the States, and it's about time.  This CD provides diverse styles of music including pop,rock and some adult contemporary with very witty and funny lyrics. For example, &quot;It's not very complicated/ I'm just young and overrated&quot;.  The 2 extra tracks provide a little extra to this version, although the catchy &quot;hot fudge&quot; is missed.  This CD is a nice to change to what is heard on much of american radio and should be enjoyed.
0786860707|5.0|Not a professional animator, I bought this book as a young teen when I was into Classic Disney Animation, along with it's companion volume.  I lost both of them in a house fire, and so when I saw The Illusion of Life at the Disneyland Gallery I put several other Disneyland items down to buy it.  This book is that good!<br />Now that I do hand drawn line animation I have found this book to be very helpful and informative.  It may not answer all your questions, but it brings up issues you have never thought of, and these small touches are what made Disney animation king for so many years.  If you don't want your work to look like Saturday cartoons for the rest of your life, this is a must have.<br />With both color examples of the layers of animation along with many black and white examples of character movement, this book is for both the professional and Disney fan.  More geared toward the professional than the Disney glossy books &quot;The making of...&quot; Illusion will be held dear on your bookcase for years to come.
B000070WJE|5.0|I've been a fan of Robbie's for a long time and I think that this album is my favorite, he is so talented!!
B000063WDH|5.0|this is by far the best album I've heard in some time, I'm talking four or five years.  As has already been written, every song is fantastic, not one disappointment.  I got a chance to see them live a few days ago and I would recommend you sell your kidneys if need be to see them.  They looked beat down from the road and I had my concerns about their enthusiasm.  However, from the first guitar licks, they kicked... Hands down the best show I've seen in my 30 years on this earth.  what I can't fathom is this on-going comparison to the white stripes.  The only similarity is the number of people in the band. Check this album out and definitely buy the follow-up, \\"Thickfreakness\\" upon its arrival on April 8th.
B00005NI5Y|2.0|This album has some terrific songs -- &quot;Mississippi&quot; is worth the price, in fact -- and Dylan sound relaxed and the band sharp.  So why a bad review?  Well, on the whole, relaxed is not how Dylan is at his best.  He was relaxed on &quot;Under the Red Sky,&quot; too.  The repeated efforts at cocktail swing just don't work for me, though clearly many people like them; he can play this stuff, sure, but why would he?  It's a little like an aging lounge act -- someone below actually referred positively to the Dylan cover of Dean Martin songs, but I fear the comparison can hardly be flattering.  The annoying part is that the good songs on this album show that he hasn't lost his touch overall and that the harm is self-inflicted.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I don't want to spoil any of the ingenious plot.  Absolutely stunning, beyond what words can describe, one of the best movies ever, and completely original.  You haven't lived until you've seen it, call out of work, skip school, do whatever you have to and WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!
B00005AAFS|5.0|This is absolutely gorgeous.  Every song on here is worth listening to repeatedly and obsessively.  Among my favorites are Ich Will, Sonne, Mein Herz Brennt, Links 2, 3, 4, Mutter and Nebel, with the other ones being plenty good in their own right.  So far I haven't heard a Rammstein song I haven't liked. Most of their songs are among my favorites of all time.  It helps to know German, in my opinion, 'cause the lyrics don't translate into the same head-banging tune as the actual lyrics do.<br />I doubt there's a single human being whose life wouldn't be greatly enriched, and perhaps even completely altered by owning this album.  Good stuff.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has done it again!Well crafted(but way too short)and literally ripped right from my life.All songs except&quot;Hit the Floor&quot; and &quot;Nobodie's Listening&quot; contain something pertaining to myself and the feelings I felt/needed/wanted to say,but didn't know how.I opened up some scars I thought had healed,revealed things I should have never revealed.I felt like a fool and acted like one too.On second thought may be this cd isn't too short but right to the point.As a sometime writer I've learned-say what needs to be said then shut up.Like now.
B000051Y0G|5.0|Let me get this out of the way:I LOVE THIS ALBUM!! Next of course to MJ's Thriller, this is THE quintessential 80s album. Personally, I love every song on this album, except &quot;Witness&quot; and &quot;When You Were Mine&quot;. Those were good, but don't quite reach the caliber the other songs do. &quot;He's So Unusual&quot; is different than what you would probably expect, but I love it because it's catchy and adds a nice touch when it zooms into the next song &quot;Yeah Yeah&quot;, another fun tune. Of course &quot;Girls Just Want To Have Fun&quot;, &quot;Time After Time&quot;, and &quot;She-Bop&quot; are the &quot;star songs&quot; on the album. But unlike the hyped-up songs of today, they are popular for a reason: they're good. Cyndi Lauper is a true phenomenon; an individual. I'll be 20 years old this year and so will the album. I can still remember dancing to &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; when I was a kid,and it was still in style! Man, do I feel old.lol But,in conclusion, buy this album. You WILL NOT be disappointed.
006092988X|5.0|When I tell people who have already read this book (especially women) that it is my absolute favorite, I typically get a look an/or a comment somewhere along the lines of, \\"How can a book about a 13 year-old girl's coming of age in Brooklyn be your favorite?\\"  Maybe I can't relate period-wise, geographically, or sexually (male/female), but there was a strong emotional connection that formed between myself and Francie the first time I read the book that I will never forget.  I've always loved libraries and reading and now that I am a librarian, I rarely walk into any library without thinking of Francie's interactions with the librarian and her goal of reading all of the books from A-Z.  This is a wonderful book for all--women, children, AND men.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Excellent mystery/drama/sci-fi movie that grabs your attention from the start and keeps it.  Lots of strange goings-ons, which probably will make more sense with repeated viewings (only seen it once, so far).  Fans of the off-beat will really like this.  Even mainstream audiences (i.e., my friends) have liked this (to their own amazement).<br />Unique, one-of-a-kind film will stay with you for days, as the questions it raises are plenty food for thought.  I didn't really get the ending explanation, but that just gives me a chance to go back and see it again (kinda the way Sixth Sense is different after the first viewing, when you know what's going on).  I found the audio commentary by the producer and main actor to be helpful toward the end...They do offer some explanations about some things you might not have picked up on that are significant.  After I watched this the first time, I went back over the last 15 minutes with the audio commentary on and was surprised to see how detailed the storyline was.  This also helped me to understand the ending better, but I'm still a tad confused, but in a good way (i.e., David Lynch movies).
B000002TPS|5.0|Youthanasia is one of the three best Megadeth records ever. The other ones are: Countdown to extinction and Rust in peace. Not one of theese three records sounds like the one before at all and that´s great. The sound on this one is not as sharp as on the previous ones and on several tracks the guitars are downtuned. If Countdown.. was a little more commercial than RIP this is a little more commercial than Countdown.. But don´t get scared now, this is still a band at the peak of their career thrashing everything that gets in their way. The songs are of different nature and each one has a unike touch. One big differece was that all bandmembers have written much of the material on this one. This helped the record to have a very personal profile. All the songs are unike, the only complain I have is that the first half is better than the second half where some songs sound a little to similar and gory. Still there are no fillers on this album, buy it now!<br />A track analysis:<br />Reckoning Day: <BR>Oh man what a blast. Full on riffing with very melodic midle part.<br />Train Of Consequences:<BR> Heavy as hell, similar to Metallicas sad but true <br />Addicted to chaos:<BR>What a songtitle, cool heavy song with good vocals.<br />A Tout Le Monde:<BR>Megadeth records a ballad! Well... Allmost. A true live classic.<br />Elysian Fields:<BR>Not much to say, good standard song.<br />Killing Road:<BR>A song about touring with Megadeth, supercool riffs.<br />Blood Of Heroes: <BR>One Of My Favourites, emotional but still heavy.<br />Family Tree:<BR>Melodic and good, one of the favourites.<br />Youthanasia:<BR>Not bad but not supergood. It sounds very dark and slow.<br />I Thought I Knew It All:<BR>Well.. Good, but...<br />Black Curtains:<BR>Depressivly downtuned and angry still with a touch of everything that made this album so special.<br />Victory:<BR>After a serie of less good songs starting with the title track Victory was a killer. Right on with intensity and energy and the lyrics are very cool. Mustaine sings about victory and throws in several titles from erlier Megadeth Albums. This was also the end of the really angry side of Megadeth. From now on they were gonna experimint a lot, starting with the next record: Cryptic Writings, or Hidden treasures actually.
1558216847|3.0|This was an intriguing story, but I had a little trouble with some of the events.  If this is basically a true story, then the man was suffering from delusions, disorientation, and distorted memory.  His escape from the Gulag was unusually easy, and as well as he was treated, difficult to justify.  He could not have survived without water as long as he said he did when crossing the Gobi Desert.  His crossing the Himalayas without proper clothing or gear is equally difficult to believe.  The sighting of the Yeti was a nice touch.  I wondered what the hurry was once the group was out of Russia.  Should they not have considered holing up for the winter in a friendly village?  And once they were out of the hospital, why did the narrator feel compelled to rejoin the army?  Surely he could have made other arrangements.  Why did he not keep in touch with his fellow travelers?  These questions persisted as I read about this amazing journey.  The writing is obviously ghost-written and has an English flavor to it.  The details recounted concerning birds, flowers, sounds, smells, etc., can be put down to poetic license, but the basic question remains:  did this really happen and was their suffering and deprivation really necessary?  There is no documentation to verify it.  One is reminded of the old joke:  I know that it is true, because he told me so himself.
0679746048|5.0|For Susanna Kasen, her life was too interrupted. Reading Girl Interrupted, you get to read Susanna's thoughts and feelings while going on a trip with her mind. Reality and perception is what this 18-year-old battles against. Finding it easy to focus on the book, just like Susanna, you are faced with concepts about life. You may find it difficult to be content with your own thoughts. Reading this book might make you unhappy with your own thoughts as this kind of poetic form of writing traps you in her mind. You become engaged and vulnerable to the ideas of life and it's reality. You might find yourself questioning, or often wondering, trying to analyze and observe what you can not comprehend. You at least try to understand her thoughts. At first, Susanna doesn't express herself and she is in denial about her problem. She didn't think that she had a borderline personality, she just thought that it was the world with the problem. Slowly, but surly, she pieces together her life in a psychiatric hospital. <BR>If you are looking to read a book that grabs your thought and pulls you into a different dimension, and is full of different perceptions, then this is the book for you. Susanna Kasen's insanity will give you an idea about what it's like for her and others like her.
B00005OAIE|3.0|You can almost hear the gutteral hiss of the capuccino makers in the background as you play this album, I swear -- this is such generic genY cafe soundtrack music.  And I was so hopeful when I bought it!  It's pleasant, sure -- and competent, and even good in a couple places -- but mostly pretty cheesey, and too deliberately evocative of other artists with more artistry to be worth all the acclaim it's getting.  Most of the songs are better enjoyed as background, they don't stand much close attention.  I'm with the Rolling Stone wag who said that &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; was a much better song when it was called &quot;Crash&quot; by the Dave Matthews Band.
B00003CXXS|1.0|Very bad third entry in the series manages to not only contradict what was set forth with the first two movies, but manages to destroy the series as a whole with a pointless story that not only insults the viewer but manages to kill a few brain sells a long the way. The cast in general is so annoying that you want the dinosaurs to kill them, and the script itself is nothing more than a thin out line for show and tell. The special effects are a few steps behind the last film, and the Spinosauris is able to change shape during different parts of the film.<br /> This movie is so bad, that I don't even consider it a Jurassic Park film, and anyone who even dares say that it's even better than the first or the second (which despite it's flaws manages to entertain in a way this movie only dreams of doing) should be a shame of themselves.
B00003CXA4|5.0|I really love this movie -- for its cinematic effects, its terrific acting, even the editing which has sometimes been called too slow.  I love it that India is recognizable in the movie, even seen through an Anglicized lens.  And I'm also partial to the portrait of the Mahatma that Attenborough painted (and Ben Kingsley brought so inimitably to life).  One can hardly escape being deeply moved by the story.  In short, it's a masterpiece.<br />But the reviewers who claim this movie is a history lesson would maybe do well to read a little Indian history: this movie, beloved as it is, is a cartoon.  Gandhi comes across as much more appealingly ecumenical here than he was in real life; it's obviously a movie made by and primarily for Christians, who might have felt alienated having to learn about the complicated Hindu principles of self-discipline and virtue that Gandhi's politics were built on.  Jinnah is rendered as a vampire (which, depending on the viewer's politics, may well be a plausible caricature -- I found it thrilling, and unusual given the British & American alliance with Pakistan against India for most of the duration of the Cold War (and the enduring Western eagerness to buy Jinnah's contradictory argument, both in the Subcontinent and elsewhere, that minorities must be provided with states in which they are majorities if their rights are to be protected under democratic regimes)).  Nearly all the British characters are extreme archetypes, not at all whole believable people (even Mountbatten, who might have been so interesting, here comes across as a dashing diplomatic cypher); and the Mahatma's enemies are all really deliciously evil and ugly.  Any sane person can hardly escape feeling at the end that Gandhi was a saint, and while this is a really pleasant feeling to nurture I'm not sure it's entirely historically fair.<br />Still -- I give it 5 stars.  How could I not?<br />I recommend the DVD over the VHS version, too, for the benefit of the intermission music, which one loses in the two-tape VHS format.  The chapter headings are a little weird, but this is minor.on music, which one loses in the two-tape VHS format.  The chapter headings are a little weird, but this is minor.
B00005JL96|5.0|I'll keep this review short and sweet. \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is my favorite Disney film of all-time. It is warm-hearted, hysterically funny, and visually stunning. Every person I have recommended this film to has loved it.<br />Best thing about this movie: it shows that a non-traditional family is just as important as a traditional one. That's something all of America needs to realize. After all, a family is defined by LOVE.<br />(Be warned though: this movie has an edge to it and it may not be suitable for all children. It is Rated PG, not Rated G like most Disney animated features. Personally, I would feel comfortable showing it to any child over five years of age.)
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie was without a doubt the best movie of the year.  That is all that really needs to be said. Within minutes you are sucked into this beautiful and magical yet terrifying world that leaves your mouth hanging open.   It's one of those movies that needs to be seen.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I heard of the musical Chicago from years ago, but really never paid attention to it.  I had no desire to see this movie either.  Reading some of the reviews, I went to see it out of curiosity.<BR>I went to a stadium seating theatre with a big screen and great sound.  From the first frame to the last, I loved every minute of it.  The music was great as well as the story and perfomances.<br />Most the reviews here seem to be one star or 5 stars.  I just can't imagine anyone hating this movie. I went back 3 more times to see it, and liked it more each time.<br />I can understand some of the criticism of the director, but there was enough traditional scenes that the chop chop chop style wasn't much of a bother to me.  In fact some of it added to certain scenes.<br />I truly don't understand how this movie was cast with of bunch of actors with little musical background..Shows you how much I know.  They were all great.<br />Queen Latifah was just plain great.  Her character in the movie was a little off.  First she is a tough talking prison matron, then she's real nice and understanding...oh well, her performance especially musically was top notch. <br />If you're tired of war movies, and sappy comedies, go see this and just lose yourself in two hours of sexy fun with great music.<br />Jerry
0446364495|2.0|I had read Bridges before I'd ever seen the movie, but after doing a Tearjerker marathon DVD night with the girlfriends, I was struck by how much better the movie was than the book.  I think Waller really did make an effort to reflect how these two people feel and what they meant to each other, even years later, but failed miserably to do so.  Maybe it was the challenge of trying to put it all in words versus watching the romance being play out on screen.  I have not read his other books, but I certainly am looking for them now (that's why I was on amazon.com today).  I'm not giving up on him, but I would recommend the movie over the book any time!
0192833383|4.0|Like his earlier novel \\"The Woman in White,\\" Wilkie Collins's \\"The Moonstone\\" is a prototype of the modern mystery:  A crime occurs, it is investigated, witnesses are interrogated and give their points of view, there is a reenactment, and it all comes together in a tightly knit conclusion.  Collins's mastery of his material is so evident that it's difficult to argue with T.S. Eliot's opinion that this is the greatest of English detective novels. <br />The mystery concerns a sacred diamond called the Moonstone which had been stolen from a Hindu temple in India centuries prior to the novel's events and made its way from owner to owner until it finally came into the possession of a British military officer who bequeaths it to his niece, Rachel Verinder...  The diamond is delivered to Rachel on her eighteenth birthday by her cousin and suitor, Franklin Blake, at a party attended by several of Rachel's family members; but the next morning, it is discovered missing from her boudoir.  <br />Theft is suspected, and the suspects are numerous:  Besides a number of servants, including Rosanna Spearman, an abject, deformed housemaid who is enamored with Blake, Blake and Rachel herself can't be ruled out, nor can their cousin (and Blake's romantic rival) Godfrey Ablewhite, a comely young man whose charitable works belie his lecherous lifestyle.  Also present in the novel as a constant reminder that the Moonstone's ties to India are not so easily severed, are three Brahmin priests who are slyly tracking the diamond's passage throughout England using disguises and subterfuge, waiting for the right moment to retrieve it and restore it to its holy place.<br />As in \\"The Woman in White,\\" Collins uses multiple narratives to relate the events and effectively introduce a bevy of colorful characters and some surprisingly wry humor.  We hear from Gabriel Betteredge, head servant of the Verinder household, whose personal bible is \\"Robinson Crusoe\\"; the sanctimonious Miss Clack, who dispenses religious tracts like a cow gives milk; Sergeant Cuff, the reputable, meticulous police detective with a green thumb that might have been a model for future sleuths with personality quirks; and Ezra Jennings, an assistant physician with a topical and curiously valid theory about the possible role of opium in the crime.<br />Comparing this novel with \\"The Woman in White,\\" I feel that \\"The Moonstone\\" has a more satisfying ending, but its predecessor has a more interesting setup and premise.  Although Collins's plots are undeniably clever and tricky (I now dub him the King of Red Herrings), these two novels are pervaded with a certain gentility that deprives them of the level of menace one finds in the grittier American noir detective fiction that I prefer.  This is more of an observation than a criticism, however.  A mystery writer who could successfully combine Collins's prose with Raymond Chandler's style would elevate the genre to its artistic pinnacle.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Today was the first day in my life that I have read a negative review of Sigur Ros, and I hope it is the last as well.  How could you give ( ) a negative review?  What could be changed to make it better?  I can tell you this...not a thing.<BR>Indeed, precious Jonsi opted to speak in words(?) none understand, yet what is the voice but another instrument while accompanied by music?  I respect the fact that Sigur Ros realize that actual lyrics only serve as a nudge to push people in the direction the artists want their interpretation to go (this does not work in all genres, however [eg emo, punk, all other lamo genres]).<BR>This album shows how when you think something is perfect, it can surprise you by becoming even better.  I had Agaetis Byrjun and Von before I was given ( ), and I thought that Agaetis Byrjun was it, that music had reached it best and the summit of its potential was found.  However, I was proven wrong, and hallelujah.  I recommend ( ) for most people, but I know some people think the music Sigur Ros play odd.  Different tastes.  But, for most who appreciate music as something to entertain and provoke, I highly recommend this album.

0140187650|4.0|Before there was the O.J. Simpson double homicide trial there was the Eichmann trial.  Hannah Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil provides insight into one of the most publicized \\"show trials\\" ever.  After the Nuremberg trial hundreds of Nazis were still in hiding or had taken assumed identities outside of Europe.  Adolph Eichmann was one of these individuals.  The Israeli Mossad kidnapped him and brought him back to Israel to stand trial for \\"crimes against humanity\\" for his role in the Holocaust.  Eichmann was abducted in Argentina where he was struggling with his anonymity.  Eichmann hated losing his identity as a powerful Nazi.  After being kidnapped, but before being flown to Israel Eichmann was asked to consent to being brought up on charges against humanity, which he did.  Eichmann may have had a difficult time living without his former social standing and identity.<br />Arendt's book is a landmark in the workings of the Nazi machine that tortured, raped, and killed over 11 million Europeans for their religion, sexual orientation, political ideas, and nationality.  However, the Eichmann trial centers more on the role Eichmann had in the \\"Final Solution\\" to the Jewish Question.  Eichmann was charged with being a key player in the destruction and eradication of European Jewry.<br />The book and Arendt's theory regarding \\"the banality of evil\\" has created controversy since its inception in 1963.  In 1963 Arendt was sent to Jerusalem to follow the Eichmann trial for The New Yorker.  She published a series of articles over the course of the trial.  It is often remarked by critics of the book that Arendt was not present for even half of the trial, yet the book is considered one of the principal books on the trial, if not the primary.<br />Arendt's basic theory is that Eichmann was a moral eunuch.  He was a cog, in a large killing machine that never contemplated his role or developed a conscious to answer questions for himself.  He simply followed orders and happened to have an instrumental job in the destruction of world Jewry.  Arendt argues that even if Eichmann had not had the job there were hundreds of other German Nazis that would have fulfilled the obligations of his job without a conscience.  Throughout the book Arendt patronizes Eichmann as a man incapable of his own thoughts; so prone to using clichés inappropriately, repeating himself, contradicting his previous statements, and utterly incompetent of original thought or judgment.  Arendt portrays Eichmann as an automaton only interested in advancing his own career.  Arendt does not even fault Eichmann for completing his job, because she thought he was simply following the orders that were given to him.  <br />This was one of the three major controversies that arose with the printing of Arendt's insight on the trial.  Arendt also heavily criticized David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minster of Israel, the chief Prosecutor Gideon Hausner, and the European Jewish community.<br />Arendt believed that the Jewish Community in Europe had meticulous organizational abilities and was instrumental in the destruction of European Jewry.  The organizations that the Jews created were able to document and provide comprehensive statistics and efficiency in rounding up Jews and aiding the Nazis.  Arendt believed the Jewish bureaucracy was impeccable in its carrying out of these duties.  This argument of Arendt's is flawed for a number of reasons.  If the Jewish communal leaders assigned these tasks did not fulfill them then other Jews may have, and if not them, then other European citizens might have, which does not completely discredit Arendt.  But the fact that does debunk Arendt's theory, that is often described as \\"blaming the victims not the criminals,\\" is the fact that the Russian Jews were systematically murdered and killed much the same way as much of Central and Eastern Europe's Jews were.  What stands to reason is there were no Jewish organizations to augment the efficiency of the Nazis in Russia.  The Nazis were able to comprehend this task without the help of any Jewish bureaucracy.  The Jewish organizations could not have been much more helpful to the Jews of Europe, Arendt really overplays this theory.  Jews were not leading their brethren to their funerals, or simply following orders like Eichmann and other cogs, but were probably trying to alleviate Jewish suffering.<br />Arendt's criticism of Ben-Gurion's treatment of the trial is precise.  There were journalists from all over the world hanging on each and every word of the trial; it was truly a \\"show trial.\\"  Even though Arendt would probably agree that Eichmann was a cog and an automaton, Israel's Premier was able to gain great publicity for the trial.<br />Throughout the course of the book Arendt restates the arguments made against Eichmann by the prosecution, when they are adequate she leaves them as is.  However, when the arguments fall short of Arendt's standards she takes the liberty of showing the flaw of the procedure, the argument, and its role in the trial.  At most points this commentary is a necessity, but at others Arendt seems to be showing her mental muscle and belittling the prosecution.<br />These are the major reasons Arendt's work was poorly received in Israel.  Her criticism of European Jewry's role in the Holocaust is rather short-sighted, but her indictment of the prosecutors and Ben-Gurion is profound.   <br />Eichmann in Jerusalem is a classic in the study of human nature, totalitarian politics, and political theory, deservingly.  The book has its flaws, but the insightful commentary on one's man adventure inside the totalitarian Nazi destructing machine is a true tour de force.

0060930187|4.0|&quot;There are no crazy people, merely crazy situations.&quot;<br />Now, I don't necessarily agree with this quotation.  I think that there are in fact, plenty of crazy people out there, many of whom think themselves quite sane.  <br />This book has been described as the story of one woman's descent into madness.  And I cannot see it as such.  In the narrator's case, I think she clearly and unflinchingly reports the happenings of the world around her.  And her inability to accept the people and standards that her society deems 'normal' as such makes her feel extremely disconnected.<br />I had been warned when I was younger that I shouldn't read this book as it was depressing, sad, bleak, etc.  I finally devoured it for the first time last month and loved it.  YEs, the tale is sad, but I found it strangely uplifting that she had such a clear, 'modern' view of the situation in which she found herself.  I highly recommend this book.

B00005JLF5|5.0|Late in the fifth season of Star Trek The Next Generation, the producers decided to embark in a new direction with a new, darker and even more character rich show.  Having made that decision, they came up with Deep Space Nine, which turned into one of the best of all of the series.  What made this series even more intriguing and enriching was its many contrasts to the way in which the other shows were produced.  In Gene Roddenberry's vision of the twenty third and later twenty fourth century's human condition, life was not exactly a paradise yet much of the strife and hardships that we contend with today are eliminated.  In the other series, there aren't many examples of conflict between the characters however, in DS9 there are plenty of opportunities for conflict between the Starfleet and Bajoran personnel or any other variety of alien species.  <br />In Deep Space Nine we're introduced to Starfleet personnel who are asked to command a space station built and formerly run by Cardassians who had been occupying Bajor for sixty years and in many ways, quite brutally!  Now that the Cardassians have decided to move out, the Bajorans aren't quite prepared to operate the station and are only in the beginning stages of rebuilding their world.<br />In many ways, this series unfortunately wasn't received as well as Star Trek The Next Generation, Star Trek Voyager or even today's Enterprise.  Often referred to as the \\"red headed\\" stepchild of the franchise, DS9 didn't initially receive the critical acclaim or the fan support it so richly deserved.<br />Some character introductions:<br />Commander Benjamin Sisko, played brilliantly by Avery Brooks is a man of strong convictions and possessed of a superb leadership quality.  In the beginning of \\"Emissary,\\" Commander Sisko is still plagued by the death of his wife at the hands of the Borg at Wolf 359.  He is raising his son Jake by himself, as a widower.  He initially felt at the time he received the assignment that he didn't want the position and that he didn't wish to stay in Starfleet.  Upon meeting Captain Picard and the stoic Bajoran people his desire to resign grows even greater.  Upon his discovery of the wormhole and the aliens within serve to change his mind as they help him to finally recover from the anguish he'd been living in since the death of his wife.  He accepts his role as the commander of Deep Space Nine and quite reluctantly accepts the Bajorans belief that he is the prophesized Emissary.<br />Major Kira Nerys, played perfectly by Nana Visitor is the Commander Sisko's choice as his first officer on DS9.  She grew up under the terrible conditions of the Cardassian occupation.  At an early age she joined the Bajoran resistance as a freedom fighter.  Her character is one of great interest and intrigue as she learns to deal with situations from a leadership/political manner rather than always taking up arms.  The role was initially to have been Ro Laren/Michelle Forbes from STNG, which probably would've been alright but thank goodness she turned it down as Nana Visitor did an outstanding job with the Kira Nerys role.<br />Chief Miles Edward O'Brien, continuing in his role from TNG, Colm Meaney performs admirably when his character accepts a promotion/transfer to DS9.  Coming along with him, but somewhat reluctantly, is his wife Keiko.  No longer used in the background as transporter chief, the character stands out in many different aspects, from the dramatic to the comedic.<br />Lieutenant Jadzia Dax, the ever beautiful Terry Farrell steps into the role of a joined Trill.  Trill are a symbiotic species, meaning that while the woman is twenty eight, the \\"worm\\" in her abdomen is another life form that has been joined with other Trill several times before.  Notably, Dax's last joining was with Curzon who had been mentor and friend to Benjamin Sisko.  Playing the science officer, Jadzia is a brilliant and quite alluring character that enhances the show greatly.<br />LieutenantJulian Bashir, played perfectly by Alexander Siddig.  Dr. Bashir is fresh out of the Academy and on his first assignment.  He is a brilliant doctor and also serves well in the role of the \\"ladies\\" man.  Of course, in a later season we learn where a lot of his intelligence comes from.<br />Chief of Security Odo who is played beautifully by Rene Auberjonois.  Odo is a shapeshifter or as we later find out, a changeling.  Odo is a being possessed with a strong conviction for justice and a great need for privacy in his own affairs.  The banter between him and Quark is perfect and very reminiscent of those between another pair on the Original Series.<br />Quark - The Ferengi that runs the stations drinking establishment.  In good keeping with Ferengi tradition, he is in on nearly every illicit and illegal activity that happens on the station.  The character is wonderful in every way conceivable, from the comedic stand point to the dramatic; Armin Shimerman's performance is brilliant and irreplaceable.<br />Garak, the Cardassian tailor/spy that was left behind when the Cardassians withdrew from Deep Space Nine is played superbly by Andrew Robinson.  While only making one appearance in this first season, the former agent of the Obsidian Order does well to secure many recurring roles in episodes/seasons to come.  He is, to date, one of the most intriguing characters of the entire genre.<br />I highly recommend this DVD set and the other seasons to come, as it is worth every penny!  {ssintrepid}<br />Episode listing:<br />Emissary<BR>Past Prologue<BR>A Man Alone<BR>Babel<BR>Captive Pursuit<BR>Q-Less<BR>Dax<BR>The Passenger<BR>Move Along Home<BR>The Nagus<BR>Vortex<BR>Battle Lines<BR>The Storyteller<BR>Progress<BR>If Wishes Were Horses<BR>The Forsaken<BR>Dramatis Personae<BR>Duet<BR>In the Hand of the Prophets<br />Special Features:<BR>Deep Space Nine:  A Bold Beginning<BR>Crew Dossier:  Kira Nerys<BR>Michael Westmore's Aliens:  Season One<BR>Secrets of Quark's Bar<BR>Deep Space Nine Sketchbook<br />Alien Artifacts:  Season One<BR>A photo gallery<BR>Several \\"hidden\\" interviews with cast members

6300216209|2.0|Nothing unmasks cheap scripting and trendy plot shifts like time, and the past thirty years have done a number on Love Story. The dialogue, while in its day considered coy and realistically witty, is now no more realistic than the plot: a combination of snappy cliches and shameless escapism, catering to those who think the mere idea of people in love is entertaining. Love Story meanders along through bad dialogue and even worse pacing toward no discernible conclusion...nothing builds, nothing changes, nothing is learned. The characters' speedy fall into love is not only unlikely (which IS romantic) but entirely unexplained onscreen (which only evoked laughter from myself and other viewers). After dispensing with 'all that falling in love with each other nonsense,' the characters' oddly boring relationship is subjected to a number of 'non-conformist' cliches: a rich father, an option to go overseas to an artistic school, a law school bid, religion, disapproval, and finally, death. Love Story's close is a reflection on its opening, melodramatic and cheaply written, but tainted by the cold knowledge that these two never actually fell in love; they simply woke up that way.
0792845668|4.0|The first Bill and Ted movie was a big hit and now they came out with an awsome sequel. Instead of going through time, they go to the after-life. The two began a Bogus Journey they won't ever forget.<br />The story starts out in San Dimas, CA 2688 at Bill and Ted University. Rufus (George Carlin) is teaching a seminar class and the evil Chuck De Nomolos invades with his private army. With him are two evil robots of Bill and Ted who he sends back through time to kill them before they become superstars.<br />We find the Wyld Stallyns (Bill, Ted, Elizabeth, and Joanna) auditioning for the battle of the bands contest. Of course they stink, but they still get a shot in the contest. That night after Bill and Ted propose to their girlfriends, the evil twins call the good Bill prettending to be Joanna and dump them. So the evil twins show up prettending to be helping them by bringing them to the desert where the evil twins said the girls were. Instead they throw them off a cliff and the good ones are dead.<br />Then they wake up in the after-life seeking revenge and then Death shows up (William Sadler). He tells them to come with him and they ask him if they can come back to life. Deaths says they must challenge him to a contest and if they win, they go back to life and if not they stay in the after-life. So they ditch him by melvining him (otherwords, a wedgie).<br />So, they go Ted's parents for help and Ted's step-mom, Missy  and her spiritual group send them to hell. So they are stuck in their own personal hells that revolve around the bad things they did in life. After the two being chased by a evil colonel, a evil easter bunny and Bill's grandma, they decide to challenge Death.<br />Now on with the games. They play Battleship and of course Bill and Ted win. Death is a poor sport and makes them play best 2 out of 3. Then he loses again in Clue and he says best of 3 out of 5. Then he loses in electronic football. Bill: \\"Best of 7?\\" Death: \\"DAMN RIGHT!\\" The last game is Twister. He loses and decides to take them back to life. They go to heaven, and find two alien scientists to help them build two good robots of themselves.<br />Now they have built the robots and they are at the Battle of the Bands where the evil ones are. So they destroy them at the concert. Chuck De Nomolos shows up to finally kill him themselves. He loses and Death melvins him (Wedgie). They play at the concert and win. The song they play is KISS's very own \\"God Gave Rock and Roll To You II\\" that they released for the movie and for their Revenge album in 1992.<br />This movie isn't as exciting as the first but definately a great sequel. Take the Bogus journey with Bill and Ted.is Twister. He loses and decides to take them back to life.

B000089CKH|5.0|This is the best album i have bought all year-- every single song is good.  great melodies, catchy hooks, subtle harmonies, and variety (varying from fast distortion to slow dreamy acoustic ballads and everything in between).  Has elements of Radiohead, Coldplay, the Delgados, Wilco, and the Flaming Lips, but better than all!  If you like any of those bands, give this a shot.  I haven't heard Nada Surf's older music, but this album is awesome-- 10/10!
B000002TLX|5.0|If you like Richard Marx's music this is definitely the music compilation of choice.  This wonderful cd has timeless rockers like &quot;Don't Mean Nothing&quot; and &quot;Satisfied&quot; along with sensational ballads like &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; and &quot;Hold On To The Nights&quot;.  Marx's sweet children's song &quot;Angel's Lullaby&quot; is sure to be a hit with fans.  This is a definitely a cd filled with songs that you can't pass up.
B000067CIJ|4.0|Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep was a hit for a certain Lally Stott the year before, but it took Middle Midle Of The Road to take it to number one in middle 1971. This charming collection of early 1970s bubblegum pop also contains their other hits Tweedle Dee Tweedle Dum, Samson &amp; Delilah and Soley Soley, plus cover versions of familiar 60s hits like Yellow River, Sacramento and I Can't Tell The Bottom From The Top. There's a tremulous quality in the female voice in songs like Chirpy and Tweedle Dee that reminds me of Stevie Nicks on some of her solo stuff. I think they were a Scottish band and I remember seeing them live in South Africa way back. As pop music goes, this isn't bad at all. Nothing cerebral, but these catchy songs still pack a punch and if you're prone to nostalgia, this will serve as a pleasant time machine trip back to your childhood.
B00005YXZH|4.0|This is my first Wilco album, and I must say that I am impressed. I had heard of them before, and as soon as I heard &quot;Jesus Etc.&quot; playing in the record store, I knew that I had to at least give it a chance. The rhythms are great, the lyrics are great (for the most part), and I only really have one gripe: the random, loud, radio static-like sounds that seem to find their way into just about every song. I can see how this might be an interesting way to introduce or trail a song. Once. But 4 and 5 times is really overdoing it.<BR>All-in-all, a great album, with some great influences, including the Beatles, and I DO believe I hear a hint of Bowie in the lyrics of &quot;i'm the man that loves you&quot;. First time Wilco listers out there: THIS IS A GREAT FIRST STEP. Maybe after you put this one through the paces, you go out a buy Being There, huh? Enjoy!
B00005JLKN|4.0|There are a few different ways you can look at Red Dragon. You can look at it as a prequel to Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, or you can look at it as a remake of Manhunter. Either way though, the potential for disaster was huge going into making Red Dragon after the dreadful Hannibal was released in 2001, but all's well that ends well here. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lecter, though he is in more of a supporting role here. Ed Norton stars as Will Graham, an FBI profiler brought back to use his unique talents to track down a brutal serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy (a tattooed and frequently naked Ralph Fiennes). Being a fan of Manhunter, I was leary when hearing that it would be re-made as Red Dragon (but not surprised considering all the money Hannibal banked), and was even more leary when I had heard that Brett Ratner was directing, but now I'm pretty much eating my words here because Red Dragon turned out to be much much better than I had expected. The only real flaw with Red Dragon are the scenes between Hopkins and Norton. In Silence of the Lambs, the interplay between Hopkins and Jodie Foster was what made that film as good as it was, but it doesn't work between Hopkins and Norton for one simple reason: Hannibal isn't scary anymore. In Silence of the Lambs, Lecter was a truly scary character that could make your skin crawl just by hearing him talk, but after Hannibal was released, he's just become a Hollywood circus side-show attraction that makes creepy sounding pronounciations. But besides all that, Red Dragon is an above average thriller that delivers the goods, and Ralph Fiennes' performance as the Tooth Fairy is reason enough to see the film.
B000007SPT|5.0|If you are ever going through a break up or a breakdown this is the soundtrack to your emotions.  Seriously, one of the best recordings of the &quot;modern era&quot; - the Cocteau's created something that became the blueprint for so much of the recent musings of Sara Brightman, Angelo Badalamenti et. al.  This recording is so deep that the only thing one can say is - give it a listen: alone, in the dark.
B000089A07|3.0|If a sense of deja vu hangs over RED DRAGON - Director's Edition, it's because producer Dino De Laurentis already made Manhunter, a 1989 version of Thomas Harris's brilliant best seller.<br />This time around, Brett Ratner directs, and Anthony Hopkins is back as insane Dr. Lekter (without Sir Anthony, there's no real justification for this film). Baby faced Ed Norton is disappointing as the reluctant collaborator of Lekter in tracking the somewhat sympathetic &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; killer wonderfully underplayed by Ralph Feinnes.  Ted Tally's lean screenplay includes the book's jolting finale, something the first film version strangely omitted.<br />The loaded two disc edition has a featurette on FBI profiling and Ratner's interesting video diary (including a weird visit to the set by Michael Jackson). The unusually incisive commentary by Talley and Ratner is as interesting as the movie.
B000083E79|5.0|The latest in an outrageously long line of Cher compilations is being released with the airing of her televised &quot;Farewell Tour&quot; concert. For those who have seen the show (and there are millions of you) - we all know what an amazing barrage of hits the ageless hippie/pop star/chanteuse/rock'n'roller/disco diva avalanches at you as you are swept up in an unabashed tribute to the 40 year spanning career of the superstar, CHER.  This CD replicates the gushing and fascinating Kurt Loder notes from the tour program (with a wonderful ending twist) and despite the blonde Living Proof image cover (we all know and love Cher as raven haired gypsy)- this is the definitive Cher CD.  Why?  It has absolutely no filler (i.e. album cuts, lesser known hits). Cher executive produced this release, so the cuts are what she chose.  Higher charting hits (&quot;Love &amp; Understanding&quot;, &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot; etc.) are omitted to include personal faves like &quot;Save Up All Your Tears&quot; - which the songstress has often mentioned is one of her favorite recordings.  Two major gripes for this reviewer: &quot;The Way Of Love&quot; tracking at just over 2 minutes could have been crammed on; this is one of her signature tunes.  The mention in the liner notes of her '67 top 10 hit &quot;You Better Sit Down Kids&quot; also points out blatant omissions.  But - hey - it's a single CD, Babe, so groove to the way it vaults from 2003 through the decades to '65 and believe that Cher, is without a doubt, the Queen of the recording industry.
B00007AJGH|4.0|The fourth home video incarnation of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? is a fully-loaded, double disc set with tons of extras and a great commentary track.  The film has never looked better. There's a family friendly full screen version as well as a pristine widescreen transfer. Part film noir, part period who dunnit and part cartoon, this breakthrough mixed genre is most remarkable for Bob Hoskins' incredible performance as an American gumshoe's  bad acid trip into a demented toon town. And there's not a single frame of computer generated imagery.<br />The publicity material claims this is a restored version, but alas the infamous frames (about 76 minutes into the film) of a panty-less Jessica Rabbit remain excised. I could find no Disney spokesperson who would comment on this silly censorship. Sorry, you'll have to see the original VHS tape or the laser disc if you want to be titillated by Jessica's cartoon crotch. Recommended.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Very enjoyable and totally entertaining.I think the reason this lengthy production is a success is the story is told by the Beatles, not by a narrator,allowing their distinct personalities to shine throughout.One does get the sense that Paul does like to take credit for a lot and likes to pat himself on the back but a minor quibble. It is sad to see the band fall apart at the end which seemed to hit Ringo the hardest. Very touching to see George, Paul and Ringo together laughing and kidding each other in the mid nineties. A wonderful experience and an essential for all fans of popular music.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has done it again with Meteora!  When I first heard about this cd i thought it would be like Reanimation.  Reanimation was a very good cd but they were mostly remixes.  The new Meteora is exciting.  All of the songs are awesome.  This cd has the exact same kick as Hybrid Theory.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.  I also like that they took the &quot;their song&quot; approach where they wrote their own songs not letting everyone else remix them.<br />There is 1 down-side that me and others have found - the cd is too short, 37 minutes!!  But I have to admit, it is great.
B000002UAR|5.0|If given enough space at Amazon.com, I could explain my position about The Beatles work much clearer and more defined so that people who read what I comment would less 'react' than 'ponder'.<br />The confusion that is inherent is the difference between Art and Pop, and that the blurring of the clear distinctions of the two has made Art suffer, and Pop flourish. It has made the innovator forgotten, and genius become a household word that can as easily apply to the person who designed your toaster.<br />Pop = Only seeks to entertain and amuse. That is its only function.<br />Art = From the beginning of human existence and the power to communicate, Art has existed. Art defines the culture as it has lived, its history, its trials and triumphs. It has a message and comments on the fabric that makes up the society or culture it belongs to or is affected by. Art has existed from the time of the cave paintings, and music used to tell the tales of the community and its day to day struggle for life.<br />The difference between Pop and Art is huge. That pop culture utilises the arts to communicate is only coincidence. So as I've said before, don't confuse the two, they are as far apart as can be.<br />Revolver is primarily Pop. It is innovative, recorded with great care and precision, its musical aspirations are all met by its players and contributors. In the end, McCartney is once again, the Pop Master. In a review of Imagine by John Lennon that I wrote that never got used by Amazon.com (is there a rule on reprinting lyrics that Amazon.com must observe?) I went through Imagine's lyrics to actually show the difference between Pop and Art, and where Lennon & McCartney, time and time again, fail to write anything other than what Pop demands. To entertain. There are very few songs in their entire catalogue that are intellectually perceptive or a commentary on the times or culture they live or did live in. When compared to Ray Davies of the Kinks, or Peter Townshend, Lennon & McCartney's lyrical depth is equatable to a puddle to an ocean. If given space at Amazon.com, I can illustrate every instance where the two writers fall short lyrically to even attain the true state of Art. Not even Give Peace A Chance can be included, it is flawed by a pop approach to a very deep and needed message. Peace.<br />McCartney again dominates the songwriting chores, and he shows himself once again to be a writer who can adapt to many styles. Though I feel his work on this album is not as innovative as everyone makes out, he shows that The Beatles were not limited to 4 man instrumentation, by introducing horns and refined string arrangement into their repertoire. But those genres already existed in pop before McCartney.The only song that may possibly speak of LIFE, is `Good Day Sunshine'. The rest is escapism, or love song.<br />Harrison & Lennon provide the innovations here, and the aspirations to Art. Harrison meets the challenge on 2 of the 3 songs, Lennon only on one. No matter how innovative and different `Tomorrow Never Knows' is, and I personally love the song, its message is never made clear. The quirk in Lennon's personality is its trying to attain art, but falling short lyrically in any context of having great depth (after 1965's In My Life). And lyric is the composer's main tool in communicating that which art demands, a message. A comment. A history. An outcry or an impassioned plea. Lennon never hits that target. He comes close on 'I'm Only Sleeping' and in the 7o's with 'Mother' and 'Gimme Some Truth'. Musically, Lennon's songs utilise all the tools available at the time. Thats where the innovation is.<br />Harrison, on the other hand, makes social comment in 2 of his songs, and alludes to it in the 3rd. 'Taxman' and 'Love You To' are Art lyrically. 'Think For Yourself' from RUBBER SOUL was the first thing Harrison wrote of concerted effort to say something about something, but Revolver is where he stops being pop almost completely, and has a message to impart. It is the responsibilty of the artist to observe and comment, to invoke response and reaction from the culture he or she represents or challenges. Davies, Townshend, Harrison, Dylan, Young are all artists, no questions asked. Lennon & McCartney, lyrically are not. They do not even come close to what Art asks of you.<br />That does not mean you can't have fun now and then. It doesn't mean that the world's problems can't be avoided for a little while and forgotten. The thing is, the Artist is there to remind you, that no matter HOW much you want to avoid the struggles of life, they will always be there no matter how much you try and escape. It is better to confront those challenges and evolve, than run and hide for the sake of a momentary smile or quick solution.<br />Revolver is probably their most consistent album, and if you own one of The Beatles albums, it may as well be this one.<br />Review by Suckerfly (in case for some reason it doesn't show up in the header, like the Sgt.

B000002U9W|4.0|I find it difficult to believe that certain people prefer post-Waters Floyd albums to this one, but they do. <BR>  This album is fantastic! The title track is a superb instrumental (with some vocal harmony) that segues from pop to jazz to orchestral in a mere 20 odd minutes, and adds new dimensions to the Pink Floyd sound. The rest of the songs on the album are also superb, being small nuggets of transitional Floyd in all it's glory.<BR>  \\"Alan's psychedelic breakfast\\" is not really a song, but rather a sound effect journey through an LSD-users preparation of the morning meal (marmalade, I like marmalade). Something like what Syd Barrett might experience. It succeeds about as well as it possibly could, for what it is. That said, after a few listens (under the influence or no), it is easy to skip.
B00008977N|4.0|While the overall remastering of the sound is good (could use more bass though), it's the reMIXING i'm a little ify about.  Some of it is good, but a lot of it ISN'T.  Long time fans of the film and accompanying CD will notice several things in the performance that weren't there before.  Extra vocal ad libs (one of which during \\"Shaking the Tree\\" when it can clearly be seen that Gabriel's lips aren't moving, and another at the tail end of \\"Secret World\\" where his voice suddenly sounds a whole octave lower - strange. Over-sight? Laziness?)<BR>For the most part, these changes don't intrude too much (kinda nice actually to hear a different mix since i'm so used to the regular one), but there are times when it just should have been left the way it was. In particular, \\"Solsbury Hill\\", which has always been my favourate part of the film.  Different/more vocal ad libs, and the end of the song has been totally rearranged.  After the last chorus, it goes right to the \\"hey hey hey...\\" bit, and THEN the keyboard lick comes in.  For me, it's really quite annoying, but for others it may not be.<br />EXTRA FEATURES:<BR>The features i was thouroughly happy with (i was thrilled to know there were going to any \\"extras\\" at all).  The \\"timelapse\\" feature was neat, showing the equiptment being rolled in and setup, the lighting and sound checks, people filing in, the concert in it's entirety, people leaving, and then finally packing everything away for the next show... all in ultra fast motion (it takes a little over a minute).  Theres a couple of nice little \\"behind the scenes\\" documentarys to, one for \\"Secret World\\", and one for his more recent \\"Growing Up\\" tour.  Both are informative and show some cool offstage footage. Worth seeing.  Also included is a remix of \\"Quiet Steam\\" (the song itself is not a remix of \\"Steam\\", but a total re-recording), over which a montage of photos from the tour are shown.  The photos aren't very interesting, but the remix of \\"Steam\\" is quite cool.<BR>_______________<br />All in all, it's WORTH GETTING, even if you already have the VHS, or laserdisc.  If your a huge fan, like myself, i'm sure your gonna get this anyway (you know you are), so whats the point of the review, but i hope this has been informative for those unsure of what they're getting into.<BR>LONG LIVE PETER GABRIEL!!
B000002A3T|2.0|While I typically do not make it a habit of reviewing albums I do not like, I make an exception for this particular album because it is maintaining a four star rating, which it in no way deserves.<br />  This is the worst album &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; ever made, and compared to the thoroughly mediocre 'Momentary Lapse of Reason' and the 'UmmaGumma' studio/noise tracks, that's actually saying more than you might think. Only Floyd fans who own every other album PF ever made, as well as the first two Waters solo albums plus all the Syd Barrett solo stuff should even think about buying this waste of polycarbonate.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I've been anticipating the release of this album for quite some time now, but must admit while tracks like \\"There's No Home For You Here,\\" \\"Black Math,\\" \\"You Got Her In Your Pocket\\" and \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" are the White Stripes at their finest, overall I prefer their previous three albums a much better compilation, from start to finish, than Elephant.<br />Jack White is at his best when he infuses blues sounds with raw rock. Much of this album avoids this strong suit, opting for more traditional pop meledy that is less aggressive than previous work. Meg sings again in Cold, Cold night, and in the final track \\"It's true...\\", which seems to be more of a snub at the media's focus on Jack and Meg's relationship than anything.<br />The blues sound is still there, but without the hard hitting, up tempo sounds that many are familiar with in songs like \\"Fell In Love With a Girl,\\" and are brilliant in songs like \\"Broken Bricks,\\" \\"The Big Three Killed My Baby,\\" and \\"Jumble Jumble,\\" it is an album that more often sneaks up into your heavy listening rotation, instead of crashing down the door and demanding to be listened to. Overall, it is still a very good album and like every White Stripes album will remain stuck in my CD player until I'm completely in love with it.
B000000ZGO|4.0|This is a truly fantastic soul album that is easily enjoyable by all and is a requirement for any eclectic music lover.<BR>  The only minor gripes I have with this album that prevent me from giving it five stars are: the last song &quot;By the Time I Get To Phoenix&quot;, which is an overly long and thoroughly self-indulgent spoken-word piece, and the mediocre mastering (since rectified by the Mobile Fidelity Koch SACD release, which is unfortunately not playable on normal CD players) quality.<BR>  The first three songs are absolute masterpieces, well worth the price of admission.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Last year when the whole Garage band thing was in full swing, and everyone was freaking out about \\"The Strokes\\", \\"The Hives\\", \\"The Vines\\" and \\"The White Strips\\" I was really skeptical. The Vines are just a poor Nirvana rip off, The Hives just plain [bad], and The Strokes are ok.....But I feel that \\"The White Stripes\\" have really risen above all the bands I mentioned. <BR>\\"Elephant\\" is offically one of the best cds I own. Jack and Meg have put out, one of the best rock cd's in the past few years. It plays off really bluesy and almost like a Zeppelin album. <BR>This album was recorded apperntly by equipment that pre-dates the Beatles. But it still sounds amazing, and they decided to add in Bass in a few songs. Which is really cool in itself.<br />So if your bored with the current rock scene. With bands like Godsmack, Limp Bizkit, Staind, Linkin Park. All comming out with there extreamly unorigonal and boring albums. Then pick this cd up. It's some of the best pure rock music out there today. <BR>Also when it comes out! pick up the new \\"Perfect Circle\\" Cd! and while your at it, get the old one as well, along with every Tool cd......Both are some of the best music in the past 10 years.
B000003CMB|4.0|When originally released, this album was an absolute breakthrough, and there has been nothing quite like it since.<br />  I would nonetheless caution people about purchasing this release over the Two-disc \\"The Fillmore Concerts\\". <BR>  <BR>  The latter album contains tracks that are not availible on this version, including fantastic versions of \\"Trouble No More\\", \\"Don't Keep Me Wonderin'\\", \\"Stormy Monday\\" and \\"Drunken Herted Boy\\". While purists may scoff at the additional material and multiperformance splicing of \\"The Fillmore Concerts\\" (by the Allmans Engineer), my side by side comparisons have led me to determine that it is in fact, a better album than this one, and easily worth the additional $$$ despite the fact that there is some overlap with EAP.<BR>   <BR>  If you can't afford the two-disc, than by all means pick up this original classic. You may regret not forking out the extra cash however, as I have.
6304981635|5.0|Bruce Lee is totally awesome.  This movie has has everything from him applying his Jeet Kune Do philosophy to different occurrences in the movie all the way too those high pitched shouts while crushing his enemies with such ease and grace.   There are even several espionage scenes that end up in mind blowing fights.  This movie never lost my interest for a minute, and from this movie I learned of who this mighty Bruce Lee was and why he was the best of the best.  Every moment just draws you in more and more.  Without a doubt in my mind this is the greatest martial arts movie ever made!
B000058983|5.0|Like the title says, this album is a completely flawless example of 60's folk-rock that easily eclipses some of the best work of CSN&amp;Y, The Doors (who shared a label and a producer), and The Grateful Dead. <BR>     How exactly a band as fractious and strangely put together as this one could possibly do something of such magnitude is almost unimaginable to me. Clearly, much of the credit should be given to lead writer/singer/coproducer Arthur Lee, who can be heard patiently waiting for the sound he wants on some of the outtakes that are included. Two of the more touching songs from this album are written by Brian MacLean (see: &quot;If You Believe In&quot;), who is tragically overlooked in almost any conversation about the band.<BR>     This album mixes, mashes and shakes together a variety of different styles of music and emerges as something wholly unique. While clearly folk-rock, this album shows obvious jazz influences and is certainly more than the sum of its parts. Other reviewers have commented on the 'depressing' tone of the album and I feel that is somewhat accurate, though the album is also starkly beautiful. If you insist on listening to solely upbeat music that is Beach Boys-esque you will hate this album. There is no surfing, there are no woodies and the snot has caked against your pants.<br />   The original CD release of this album was horribly done, with a high-frequency whine audible on every single track; a great injustice to be sure. This release sounds fresh and includes wonderful outtakes and demos (&quot;Hummingbirds&quot;, &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;) that are almost worth the cost of the album alone. If you enjoy ANY part of 60's rock or folk music, this should be one of the first albums you buy. <br />    Alas, none of the bands other work rivals this superb effort (but then, not much else does), though &quot;Da Capo&quot; is also quite good.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is THE Classic Rock album. The Beatles are  stunning in their song writing and song arrangments. Lennon/McCartney/Harrison/Starr are brilliant. This album has everything that you want:<br />All out rockers: &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, &quot;Back in the USSR&quot;, &quot;Birthday&quot;.<br />Ballets: &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;.<br />Comical: &quot;Piggies&quot;, &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot;.<br />Psychedelic: Revolution 9.<br />If I were to pick only one Beatles LP, this would be it. From the opening notes of 'Back in the USSR', to the closing strings in 'Good Night', this album shines. 5 Stars!
B00008LDPU|5.0|One word: WHOA! (apologies to Keanu bashers). Final Fantasy was merely a vehicle for Square's animation breakthrough and it showed. The novelty eventually wore off leaving you with a feeble, pointless story that should never have made it to the big screen. FFO has everything FF lacked: dynamic action sequences that would be difficult (if not impossible) to execute in live action, characters you actually CARE about and, most importantly, BREVITY. Don't get me wrong, being a HUGE Matrix fan I thought it was way too short. But crammed into those exquisite nine minutes were some of the best action sequences I've ever seen. The same level of excellence would be difficult to sustain throughout a feature-length movie. FFO is the perfect teaser for Reloaded. Well worth the price of admission all by itself and, IMHO, should win the Oscar for Best Animated Short. I can't wait until May 15th!
0743244249|1.0|The concept, a day-in-the-life of a young American capitalist as he sets out in his limo to get a haircut uptown is intriguing. However, the devil lies in the details of which this book is sparingly thin on. The main character and the lovers and American archtypes(anarchists, protestors, politicians, wall st gurus) he encounters throught out the day are, as Melville would say, nothing but pasteboard masks. Delillo is an original writer chasing after interesting ideas relevent in American culture, it is just that in this book unlike \\"White Noise\\" and \\"Libra\\" he didn't do his homework and the book comes off flat as a result.
B000063DI8|2.0|THE BAND: Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Dave Murray (guitar), Janick Gers (guitar), Steve Harris (bass), Nicko McBrain (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1990) 10 tracks clocking in at just over 44 minutes. Included with the disc is a 14-page booklet that contains band pictures, song credits/titles, song lyrics, and thank you's. Recorded at Steve Harris' Barn somewhere in England on the Rolling Stone Mobile. Cover art by Derek Riggs. Label - Epic. *The digitally remastered version (on Sanctuary Maiden label) released in 2002 offers more in the way of liner notes and videos for your PC.<br /><br />COMMENTS: It's hard for me to write this review, since I've been a fan of Iron Maiden from the beginning. I have their entire collection on disc - Iron Maiden has so many great releases. Some of those (\\"Number Of The Beast\\", \\"Powerslave\\", and \\"Piece Of Mind\\" to name a few) are all-time British metal classics... as well as all-time heavy metal classics. However, there are so many things wrong with \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\". What the heck happened after 1988's \\"7th Son Of A 7th Son\\" (less than 2 years prior)? The sound (production) is flat. Much different from previous albums - Steve Harris' Barn and the Rolling Stone Mobile I'm sure has something to do with it. This was a first for the band recording here (most of their classic 80's material was recorded in the Bahamas or France). Guitar wizard Adrian Smith is gone... working on solo projects and beckoning Dickinson to join him (a few years later he got his wish). For the most part, the melodies are forgettable. And most importantly, the lyrics are silly, or don't fit with the song. Several reviews here trash Dickinson's vocals. I disagree - I think he sounds fine, but the lyrics just don't go with the guitar licks and melodies... leaving an awkward feel to most of this album. \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" is also missing a trademark epic song. It doesn't have to be a 13-minute \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\", but something lengthier than \\"Mother Russia\\" (the longest song on the album at 5:31) would have been nice. Steve Harris is an amazing bassist, but the questionable bass playing on \\"Run Silent Run Deep\\" simply baffles me. The original album cover artwork features Eddie reaching out and choking a man... on the remastered edition, the man is gone and (background) colors are slightly changed. The band's most recent \\"live\\" albums (\\"Death On The Road\\" and \\"Rock In Rio\\") feature NO songs from \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\"... what's that tell you! On the plus side, the songs \\"Holy Smoke\\" and \\"Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter\\" made it to their \\"Essential\\" (2005) and \\"Edward The Great\\" (2002) best-of compilations. The latter of the two also made it to \\"Best Of The Beast\\" (1996). While these two songs are easily the best songs on the disc, that's not saying much... they're both weak compared to anything the band did in the 80's. The 3rd best song is \\"Tailgunner\\" - good tune with unconforming lyrics. I've kept the original disc and opted not to trade in for the remastered version - even with better sound quality, it's still an album I won't listen to much. In my opinion, Iron Maiden really struggled in the 90's... two sub par albums with Bruce (\\"Fear Of The Dark\\" was the other one), and two with sad replacement singer Blaze Bailey (\\"X Factor\\" and \\"Virtual Xi\\"). I've tried repeatedly to get \\"into\\" this album over the years... and I simply can't do it (2.5 stars).hing lengthier than \\"Mother Russia\\" (the longest song on the album at 5:31) would have been nice.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I like to check every thursday the Billboard's charting lists and last year I saw in several lists the Norah Jones name but I don't know, she never called my attention and when I heard the song &quot;come away with me&quot; happened the same thing and I didn't buy the album. So this year when I saw the Grammy ceremony I saw as everyone did that she won 5 of them  and then I heard the song &quot;I don't know why&quot; and i decided to buy her cd. Played and I found it very good and now I love hearing it while I'm sending mails or even reading a book. It's so relaxing and Norah's voice is extraordinary you can hear this cd all day long and you'lll never get tired.
0553382179|5.0|This truly is the best organizing book out there...it really does change your life.  During the un-cluttering process, you can toss all those other books on eliminating disorder.  Having read most of the organizing, sorting, de-cluttering books out there, I was happily surprised to find one that really did the trick, starting with the inside.  If you want to feel good about your house and really want a sparkling home that doesn't seem to take forever to keep up -- this is a wonderful little book.  Expect a change in attitude and brace yourself for a friendlier, cleaner home.
B00005QK3W|5.0|After venturing into Paul's post-Beatle career with All The Best, then, much later, the albums McCartney and Ram, I realized he had a lot to offer on his own. Then I randomly grabbed Driving Rain after seeing it on the shelves for over a year. THIS ALBUM IS AS GOOD AS ANY OF HIS POST-BEATLES RECORDS, IF NOT BETTER. McCartney is an incredible artist in the recording studio, and Driving Rain proves his skills have only improved over the years. It's not a big rock album; it reminds me of Ram, only Driving Rain is much more professional-sounding, in a good way. This is how music is supposed to sound. Thank the British we still have good artists, however old they may be, writing the best music in the new millenium.
B00005QIPH|5.0|first time i ever even heard of the strokes i was ridin in the car with this chick who use to live on my couch.  she and i were riding around and she popped in a tape and i was like \\"WOAH, what was that??!!\\" she said \\"strokes\\".  song was \\"last night\\".  from that day on the strokes have pretty much been my favorite band.<BR>this band can make you laugh, sing at the top of your lungs, and in all put you in a d*** good mood.  it doesnt matter what kind of mood your in, you cannot be depressed or .... off and be listening to the strokes.  it snaps you right out of it and puts you in a great mood.  i dont know what it is.  <BR>unfortionatly, i dont know if its just the city i live in now but nobody knows who the strokes are..  its crazy.. i mean they know who sublime is and the femmes and all that but the strokes, nobody knows..  <BR>if youve never heard this band before this is the cd id buy.  this is an eccential cd to your collection. more than anything, its an essential cd to have in your car.  great road trip music..<BR>my 2 favorite songs:<BR>soma<BR>last night<br />just BUY IT!!!!!
B00005YW4H|1.0|The worst thing I have ever listened to in my life!   She sounds like a horse!!  Do yourselves a favour listen to some good music.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Not, this album is the worst thing i have ver heard. They bring in other rifts or similar beats from the White blood cells. This is their worst album. It picks up at the end but it doesnt help any. This is just a bad cd. I wouldnt buy it if i had a second chance.
B000084T18|4.0|Yeah, this album was very over-rated.  I can't believe he sold as many copies as he did.  Most of the production gets 5 stars (because of Dre and Em of course).  50's flow isn't all that flashy or exciting, but he gets his point across.  If you are looking for more commercial songs like \\"In Da Club\\", don't cop this album, because it is a street album. As far as comparing 50 to Pac or Biggie (or even Em), I don't think so.  \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" isn't close to Nas's \\"Illmatic\\", Biggie's \\"Ready 2  Die\\", or Jay Z's \\"Reasonable Doubt\\".<br />Best Tracks:<BR> 2. What Up Gangsta<BR> 3. Patiently Waiting<BR> 4. Many Men<BR> 7. Heat<BR>11. P.I.M.P.<BR>14. 21 Questions
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park is an over rated band. They did nothing to perfect their sound. They simply just took the beats from the last album and the cd is only 36 minutes long. All these songs sound similar its just said that Linkin park could not step up and change their sound a bit. In my own words they didn't grow at all
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna's record &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is by far one of Madonna's best work yet.  From the electro feel of &quot;Skin&quot;, &quot;Swim&quot; and the self title song &quot;Ray of Light&quot; to the guitars that strum in &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; to the sensual feel of &quot;Frozen&quot;.  Madonna does it again, wowing everyone including winning several Grammies for this record.  Madonna does a lot of soul searching and you can feel this through her lyric choices.  A personal favourite is &quot;Drowned World/Subsitute For Love&quot; which wasn't released in North America. It is the first track and it's a brilliant way to start of the record.  Madonna proves that she still has it after many years of constantly putting out # 1 hits. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
6304467583|5.0|You won't find this version of the classic Godfather Trilogy anywhere else! This exclusive version tells the story of the Godfather (Parts I, II and III) specially edited into a single movie in chronological order by Francis Coppola himself with additional scenes and footage not in the theatrical releases and not in any other release currently available. It also includes a bonus &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; video and booklet and comes in a black collector's box. Over 9 hours of video!  The best of the best!
B000060P79|1.0|stop telling me you listen to punk rock if you like this band.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is the best one I bought in the year so far.. and it's gonna be hard to beat it. As you've read in the reviews up to now, the rock/piano/vocal combination is pure gold. It takes some great minds to put out music of this calibur. I'll keep this short and just say if you don't get this one.. you're missing out!
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I watched her \\"Dirrty\\" video for the first time on MuchMusic last fall, I really didn't know what to expect from this album. However, I could sense a drastic change happening on her new album... and I was right.<br />\\"Stripped\\" is definitely an emotional album. It is much more emotional compared to her self-titled debut that was released back in 1999. After listening to the album, I felt better for Christina because she got her message across, about some of the bad things that have happened to her since her childhood. With Christina writing and singing emotionally on this album, she successfully establishd a conversation with you on this album.<br />In terms of individual tracks, the choice of linking \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Fighter\\" back to back can be understood. \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" and its interlude really sound like those Mariah Carey songs that are produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.<br />\\"Infatuation\\" was the song that Christina performed on the 2002 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony and it's about her relationship with her father. It was one of the weaker tracks on the album. The interlude of this song is not necessary, but then, Christina has always wanted to explore her latin roots, so...<br />\\"Impossible\\", the Alicia Keys-produced track was fabolous. It was the song that Christina sang at this year's American Music Awards (for those of you who are not aware of this).<br />\\"Beautiful\\", the Linda Perry-produced track was definitely a great single, in fact, one of the best songs on the album.<br />As for her first single, \\"Dirrty\\", it really shouldn't be placed in this album because this track didn't fit the theme of the album. If I was Christina, I would have kicked this song out of the album, but then, there's the video...<br />And because of \\"Dirrty\\", I can see why \\"Stripped Pt.2\\" was listed as track #17 but not track #20.<br />Overall, a really mature album, maybe a bit too mature for a sophomore release. I really don't know what's her third album will be like but she may experience some difficulty in topping this release. If you are ONLY into teen-pop or her old days and her old sound, this album may be too mature for you. As for others who enjoy various types of music, you should pick up this album.
B000089RVX|1.0|Dont buy this cd, if you want to listen to some real gothic metal listen to Lacuna coil, the gathering, or nightwish.  Evanescence [isn't good] there guitar riffs are very similar to linkin parks.  There music is nothing new, and all you people that say you have been looking for a cd like this for a long time, you have got to be kidding me.  There are many other female rock/metal singers with alot more talent then Amy Lee.  <BR>Go buy a real cd.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Hybrid Theory alone went platinum 14 times, quite a lot had to happen in order for LP to follow up.  It seems that they succeeded in that.  The cd is a LOT harder than Hybrid Theory.  The only problem with the cd is that it sounds a lot like their first cd.  Which in reality, isn't a problem at all.  If you thought their first cd was too soft, definatly try this one out for size, because all of the songs on the cd are much harder than any on Hybrid.  Just a note: Numb sounds very close to &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; only different lyrics and music, listen to both of them very closely (Especially Chester) and you'll see what I mean.
B00008LDPU|5.0|One or more of these shorts will be nominated for an the oscar for best animated short next year, and one of them will win.  I went to see Dreamcatcher (yeah right) and saw the gem that is \\"The Final Flight of the Osiris\\" aka TFFOTO.  I'm a sucker for CGI, I've been enamored since \\"The Last Starfighter\\", and have enjoyed watching the technological advances in this field, from \\"The Abyss\\" to \\"Terminator 2\\" to \\"Jurassic Park\\" finally to things like \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"FF: The Spirits Within\\" but this blows them all away, TFFOTO is the missing link between cgi and \\"reality\\", if I was an actor, I'd work on my voice, because soon they won't need your face.  If you've seen TFFOTO and remember the sword gripping seen you know what I mean.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I will assume that if you are a native Japanese, and speak it, and are accustomed to the myth and lore; this movie would make some sense to you.  It made very little sense to me until the next day when I thought about it, and realized it was a contemporary look at human nature, and the inherent idea temptation and resistance.  For the parent's that rant how it wasn't meant for children...a \\"PG\\" rating suggests that perhaps it isn't, the parent must decide, even if that means the parent buys a ticket and watches the movie themselves first...make informed decisions.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Bad Boy Brit Robbie Williams is back with a new disc and a mature new sound.  Not only is \\"Escapology\\" Robbie's best disc to date, it is the best album of the decade.  Again collaborating with long-time songwriting partner Guy Chambers, Robbie has crafted a slick, tuneful CD awash in glorious harmonic invention and Robbie's trademark self-glorifying/deprecating lyrics.  In contrast with his past work, \\"Escapology\\" is much more cohesive, and certainly comes from a darker place than his previous work.  His much publicized (in Europe, anyway) flight to Los Angeles to escape problems with drugs and celebrity definitely paid off, in songs like \\"Monsoon\\", \\"Come Undone\\" and \\"Get a Little High\\", lyrical proof of the high price of celebrity.  <br />The crown jewel of the album is a 7-minute masterpiece entitled \\"Me and My Monkey,\\" a Hunter Thompson-esque dream vision of Robbie on a road trip to Las Vegas with a monkey on his back.  The haunting latin-tinged melody perfectly combines with a surreal tale of drugs, sex and rock and roll in Sin City, and evokes memories of \\"Hotel California\\" and Jack Kerouac while maintaining Robbie's signature humor and pathos.  <br />If, like 99.9% of the American public, you've never heard of Robbie Williams, this is a perfect introduction to his stunning voice and brilliant song crafting ability.  If you're a Robbie fan, rejoice... it doesn't get any better than this.<br />Note that the American release of \\"Escapology\\" differs quite a bit from the British release...  both versions are required listening.

B00003CXBK|1.0|I am a huge fan of Anime. When i first heard about this movie i thought it be cool. But when i watched it i was bored to death. The store line drags out and you think it is about over but find out that it is just starting really. Check out Akira and also Ninja Scroll. They are some of the best anime out there.
0553277472|5.0|Just finished reading ZAMM for the third time. Once again, I got something different from this great book. ZAMM is inspiring, challenging, difficult, fun, thought-provoking ... it requires you to THINK. It isn't an easy read, but it is well worth the effort.<br />The last time I finished reading ZAMM, I persuaded three friends (all intelligent people) to read it. They all hated it. Go figure.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought the Daredevil soundtrack, and decided I absolutely had to have Fallen! IMO, Fallen is better than the other, because of more Amy Lee! Much of Daredevil blends together, while every song on Fallen is like an entirely new experience. The strength of the songwriting will have you imagining other worlds, while Amy's amazing vocals will bring your heart along for the ride. I cant get enough of this band, and my enthusiasm is spreading to friends all over my college campus.
B00008H2LB|3.0|this CD is way too short....it can't come around Hybrid theory at all...only like 3 tracks thats stand out
B00006879E|5.0|FINALLY!!!  An original sound!  I think the industry has been really needing a fresh band to hit the scene.  These guys have it all... stellar sound and ingenius lyrics.  They're totally unlinke anything out there right now!  You'd have to be deaf not to get hooked on this album!
B00008AWOD|3.0|Sorry to say it, but this album is a bit of a let down.  I've listened to it a couple times now, and already wonder if I want to keep it.  <BR>Black Market Music, the previous album, is this band's highpoint.<BR>On this new one - as much as the vocals are a distinct aspect of Placebo - in most cases they're just annoying, too loud over the music.  They're one of my favorite bands, but I guess it's gotten old to hear words like \\"black\\" sung \\"blaa-Hack\\" or \\"scar\\" sung \\"scar-Harr.\\"  I think the production is great, there are some great songs.  I think it's just hard to top Black Market Music.  When I think of Placebo I want music for the end of the world, emotive, beautiful, loud guitars, something that would scare adults.  I don't think the new one totally does this.
B000002LLC|4.0|The Material Girl would later wow critics and audiences alike in her Golden Globe-winning performance in the film &quot;Evita&quot;, but &quot;I'm Breathless&quot; is a preview of things to come.  The singer showed a maturity and depth that she had not presented before.<br />She holds her own with Broadway star Mandy Patankin on the Stephen Sondheim-penned &quot;What Can You Lose&quot;.  This has to be one of the strongest Madonna performances on record.  Paired with &quot;Something to Remember&quot;, Madonna's &quot;torch&quot; side comes through.<br />Other reviewers have labeled the majority of the album as &quot;filler&quot;, but it is filler that illustrates the singer's versatility.<br />By being a mainstay in the music world for over two decades, Madonna has endured the changes and emerged a reckoning force in the industry.
B00000J7S8|4.0|Diana Krall sings ever CD very special. With a very good band. It is music for every our of the day. Specially in the evening with a good glass of wine.
B00006WUWP|3.0|The Austin Powers series may go down as profitable but it will not reach the heights of the great comic films of all time.  There is so much one can do with phallic and other genitalia humor.  Also, flatulence jokes can only permeate the air for so long. References to the female's mammary glands can get &quot;dry&quot; after a while.<br />Maybe, for 14-year-old boys &quot;Goldmember&quot; is great art.  But, for the rest of us, it's a joke that wore out its welcome two films ago.

I read a book a week from a variety of authors and have read many of Grisham's books. I've enjoyed all the rest of his books and found them highly intelligent and thought out. In The Partner he makes every indication that the main character's friend Eva is madly in love with him and gives no indication or reason why she leaves him except that he wants that one last shock to the readers/audience. If you are going to end a story like this there should be some clue(s) even if they are so subtle that you have to reread some of the story to find them. Sorry if this ruins the book for anyone, but spend your money on one of his other books.

B00008GKEG|5.0|This DVD contains wonderful new footage. The highlight is , of course, finally seeing Paul, George and Ringo sing a few songs together. It is a joyous, magical thing to watch. And at the same time, a sad moment that makes you wonder what kind of great music we could have heard if they had  reunited for an album. But at least  we have these few minutes of the greatest pop group ever singing together one last time.

B00005JLSE|1.0|Take a premise that's based on tabloid journalism, mix it with a quasi-historical situation, and then stir with music.  The result: Chicago.  Forgettable songs surrounding a dubious plot, with poor acting and mediocre singing and dancing.  It's a wonder this production even made it to the movie theaters.<BR>The dialogue was obviously meant to be cynical and sarcastic, making us aware of Americans' fickle obsession with celebrities, but it somehow ignores the racism, poverty, mob warfare and other maladies that were much more prevalent in the 1920's.  The movie is lost in its own razzle-dazzle.<BR>If you want to see a movie musical with social commentary, I'd advise you to obtain Cabaret, where it's done right.
068484267X|4.0|the story of a young boy named frank mccort who is born in america and moves with his family to ireland.  the time is depression era amercia and things are not much better when they move to ireland.  sometimes funny, sometimes stark and horrifyingly sad.  this book is a great read about the poor and destitute life of young frank mccourt.  <BR>    my only question is this: if franks's mother(angela) is so poor then why in the world would she keep reproducing?  they cannot afford to eat themselves and yet they crank out the babies.  even after some of their children die of various disease/starvation, they continue to reproduce.  <BR>     other than that, the book is ok, showing that even in the worst of circumstances there is fun to be had and laughing to be done.  this book will make you laugh and cry.
B00008H2LE|5.0|I bought the Linkin Park album w/ the dvd.  It's amazing!  It's one of the few cds that I can play all the way through withut skipping tracks.  Chester (lead vocals) has an amazing voice, and the rest of the band has an awesome sound.  All I can say is go out and buy it, cus It rocks!
B00008MNYS|5.0|This album rocks! If you've never heard of Robbie Williams, please listen to him (or better yet, buy the CD), it's definitely worth it. There are a lot of great songs on this album, my favorite being Handsome Man, but every song on this album is great. So go buy it!!!!
B00005JLK1|4.0|Gabriel Byrne and Julianna Margulies have the two central roles that make this movie work so well. A female on a Salvage Crew is my type of non petite, assertive woman.  This is done here in a manner to not simply imitate a masculine perspective.  Movies deserve more of a gender balance in lead characters.   I rented the movie and read the back of the package when I got home.  Haunted House and 13 Ghosts were comic book stories with a special effects make over.  I was angry at myself for not reading this before renting the movie, as I was not impressed at all with these brainless special effects gore fests.  I was pleasantly surprised that Ghost Ship does indeed represent real story telling.  At the end, I thought the total package of Ghost Ship worked in the most basic terms of entertainment.  However, I will have to admit that I am not sure I am comfortable in seeing child actresses used in horror movies since the death of the Poltergeist child actress under unusual circumstances.  It is an impressionable age, and these are images that remain with you for a very long time.  The end of the movie leaves the door wide open for a sequel. For a change, this may be a horror movie deserving a sequel if done in this more intelligent than comic book style.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I only just got into ND and before this I only had Tragic Kingdom (great album by the way) to listen to. So I nagged my mum and she went out and brought it. Yay! I didn't know what to expect really, by the time I got it \\"Hey baby\\", \\"Hella good\\" and \\"Underneath it all\\" had all been released and I liked them all. Especially the video to \\"Hey Baby\\". <BR>I thought it had a good mix of songs, from ballads to really funky beats that stick in your head ALL day!! <BR>I would say don't expect another Tragic Kingdom, it is way more positive vibes! But it is brill anyway. You can tell Gwen has come on lyricaly and it is a breath of fresh air from some of the manufactured rubbish out there. <BR>Buy,listen,have fun and don't forget to keep Rockin' Steady!!!
B00006ZSAD|5.0|Well after hearing Beths vocals behind Geoff Barrows production. It was quite easy to underestimate her abilities to carry out the same legacy. But I have to honestley say this is an impressive work of art. The songs have the same Haunting feel that portisheads tracks have. The tracks that would remind you the most of P head on the lp are &quot;Tom the Model,Romance,Spider Monkey,Funny time of the year &amp; Rustin Man.&quot; And these tracks only remind you because of the Haunting lyrical arrangements and background chants. The remainder of the lp is more of a Piano acccoustic type sound, but doesn't disappoint in the least! Beth Gibbons would clearly put you in the mind of &quot;Goldfrapp&quot; or &quot;Fiona Apple&quot; to some degree. If you like this you may want to consider getting those two artist in addition to this. &quot;Tom the model&quot; has such a beautiful climax like a movie theme of some sort. It is quite clear that Beth is an ultimate song writer. And this cd just proves that her songs stand out even without Portisheads amazing production. So we know now that she is gifted and Portishead truley wouldn't be the same without her writing contributions. &quot;Romance&quot; has some beautiful instrumentation behind it. The strings, Horns orchestration of that song is haunting! There is also Harmonizing in the background which would remind you of a London Orchestra choir of some sort. &quot;Sand River&quot; is very reminiscent of Fiona Apples first and best effort.&quot;Spider Monkey&quot; is a piano track with a Haunting feel to it, very reminiscent of the P Head signature. This is an impressive work of art you will not be disappointed. The only thing that hacked me was how short the project was. But I guess she had to save something for the upcoming P Head &quot;Alien&quot; Lp!<br />Arish

B000084T18|5.0|tupac and biggie were the greatest of all time but that time is over,and now its some one elses turn i'm just glad its 50's turn instead of ja rule of benzino for example. this cd isn't brilliant but it's right up there with brilliant. 50 is one of the only real rappers out there any more and will be for a while as long as he dont sell out like the rest of them did. but dont expect that to happen any time soon. to all u people who want to run your mouth just remember what 50 said in his song patiently waiting;you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house and if you got a glass jaw u should watch your mouth cause i'll break your face.
B00008H2LB|2.0|This CD is just okay.  There's not really anything that amazing about it.  The thing that was so amazing about their debut was that it had never been heard before, but this CD is just more of the same.  Not that it's not worth listening to, but it's just that this CD is nothing new and amazing.  I was an LP fan back when they were Hybrid Theory, and I met them all in Denver with the Kottonmouth Kings before Hybrid Theory ever came out.  They're all great guys and they're very talented.  But don't be fooled by other reviews saying this CD is amaing.  You've heard it all before, but it is still worth listening to.
B00005JLSE|3.0|It's ironic that this film's tremendous success has been attributed to a craving for \\"feel-good\\" entertainment: in reality, this is a dark, grim, cynical downer of a movie.  Chicago is devoid of a single likable character.  The music is catchy, and the acting is solid throughout, but it's all in service of a story that didn't deserve to be sold.
0804106304|4.0|The four winds may change direction, and histories may shift at any given moment, but Amy Tan's, `The Joy Luck Club' remains a captivating tale about four mothers and their four daughters. <BR>The Chinese game Mah-jong works to join the mother's together as they form the club and share the secrets and tragedies of their lives as well as their hopes and dreams for their daughters. The women in this novel struggle to bestow their daughters with the virtues of Chinese traditions and at points seem to go too far-pitting their daughters against each other and sadly living their lives through them. <BR>Tan writes both honestly and sensitively examining the generation gap between mothers and their daughters as well as the struggles migrants face when joining other countries. `The Joy Luck Club' belongs to a genre which can only be described as realistic with characters which are both three dimensional and relatable.<BR>The story is written through defined chapters-each dedicated to either a mother or a daughter; as they weave their histories and spin their stories.<BR>The novel, through this chapter fragmentation, allows each character to develop, with an emphasis on the main narrative- the death of one of the members of the club. The death of Suyuan Woo results in the incorporation of her daughter Jung Mei `June' Woo into the group. June realises her mother- who died suddenly of a cerebral aneurysm - had unfinished business which leads June to face one of the biggest tragedies in her mother's life. `The Joy Luck Club' is an inspiring novel which is both moving and courageous-a definite pleasure to read.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|A high and fast fantasy with plenty of schwung. Angelina Jolie is a pleasure to watch in action and also in repose, altho this last does not occur often. <BR>I noted two minor peculiarities: The microwave oven Lara uses does not apparently have a timer and the food explodes! The gang of &quot;coolies&quot; employed to pull down the wall of the temple could have been replaced by a single easily portable cable winch (pull force 2500 kgs) operated by one man.<BR>Otherwise good fun, well worth viewing more than once.
B00008MNYS|4.0|I bought this album last fall through the Amazon UK site (for about double the price).  I think it is such a shame that Robbie hasn't been more accepted by the American public. If you are a Robbie fan, I am sure you will add this one to your collection.    <br />\\"Feel\\" is the first single, but I love the song \\"Sexxed Up\\".  Revolution, Monsoon, Nan's Song, the list of great songs goes on.  Hopefully people will see the humor in Robbie's songs such as \\"Me and My Monkey\\" and \\"Handsome Man\\".<br />If you haven't listened to Robbie yet, check this and some of his earlier albums out.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is a must for every Beatles fan.  The picture quality is great, but that's normal with DVD and the Beatles' story is quite unbelievable.  But the best part of this DVD edition (and not surprisingly) is the sound!  Even if one has a gripe with the documentary whatever it may be, one absolutely cannot turn your back on the amazing clarity and new life all the Beatles songs have in full 5.1 surround sound be it Dolby Digital or DTS.  You hear all the instruments in a 3-dimensional soundstage!!.  Some songs have a new majesty to them in 5.1 surround (especially \\"THE END\\").  It truly brings a new appreciation to the musical composition and techincal wizardry the Beatles music has.  Simply breathtaking.  On some rehearsal takes, you actually feel like your in the recording studio with them Beatle guys!!!<br />The sound on the VHS and LD versions pale in comparison.  If after listening to the remastered Yellow Submarine DVD you were left craving for other Beatles music to be re-mixed in surround, this boxed set fills that need.  Though it also leaves one wanting (DEMANDING) for the entire Beatles catalog to be both carefully restored to preserve the original mono and stereo mixes of each album but also have them re-mixed into full surround for either SACD or DVD-A formats.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie kicks ...!  A wonderful, continuation in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this movie was nearly as true to the book as is possible with this type of media.  Save the Ents, the characters are true to Tolkien's ideal and contain such a richness it one is hardly able to call them \\"characters.\\"  Every detail was given forethought and later, perfected.  While the length of the movie may initially dissuade some potential viewers, it doesn't lessen the enjoyment of this true epic in the least.  <BR>That said, I urge everyone who takes any pleasure in fantasy, myth, epics, literature, or science fiction to allow themselves to get caught up in the power and majesty of Tolkien's world which Mr. Jackson has so eloquently conveyed.<BR>Finally, GOD BLESS Orlando Bloom!  This movie is a MUST for any female....lithe and balletic, and beautiful, Bloom's Legolas is a definite must-see.
0064407667|4.0|This book is the first in a series that appears to be continuing, as \\"The Carnivorous Carnival,\\" the ninth book in the series, has recently been released.  I had thought at first that the eight original books formed a limited series with the eighth being the last.  Apparently the torment of the Baudelaire orphans gets to continue for some length of time in the future.<br />We meet the three Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus and baby Sunny, on a beach, on a somewhat hazy or even foggy day.  Through the fog comes Mr. Poe, a banker who takes care of their parent's financial affairs.  We discover that the gloomy day is a harbinger of Mr. Poe's even gloomier message; their parents have perished in a fire.  The story becomes even gloomier as a new home for the children means moving in with their distant cousin Count Olaf.<br />It turns out that Count Olaf seems to regard murder and possibly pedophilia as acceptable pursuits.  Count Olaf seems to find it acceptable to hang baby Sunny in a cage from a tower, and later to tell the children that all but Violet will be disposed of after he gets his hands on the fortune their parents have left to them.  Furthermore, Count Olaf and at least one other character do things that are strongly sexual in nature with respect to Violet.<br />In spite of the relatively gloomy story, there is a somewhat happy ending, though that ending segues into the setup for the next book.<br />The question is whether this book, and the series of books, is suitable for young children.  My thought is that the child reading the book should likely be at least 8 years old, and perhaps 9.  Each parent needs to decide whether their child is sufficiently mature to handle the subject matter in this book, and the subsequent books.<br />While the nearly overt sexual situations may make some parents uncomfortable, not to mention the references to torture and abuse of children, as well as death threats, given that these situations actually occur in the real world, could these books be an opportunity to explain things that can happen and do happen to people in the real world.  By recognizing characteristics of these situations, children can better be prepared to avoid such situations and even be prepared to tell someone about what they know is wrong.<br />One strong point of these books is that they have a strong educational message.  Throughout the books words are defined as they are used in conversation, making these books good transition books for children in the 9 to 12 age range.<br />We all want to protect our children as long as possible, and somehow hope they will remain innocent forever.  However, we all must grow up, and often as we grow up we must face unpleasant images.  This book presents some of those unpleasant images in a way that allows parents to address real-life concerns.  I recommend this book, but be very sure you know your child and what is in this book before you allow your child to read it.  Four stars for an interesting approach to a story in this age range.could these books be an opportunity to explain things that can happen and do happen to people in the real world.

B00008H2LB|5.0|LInkin PArk has come along way with this cd. From there cd hybrid theory to Meteora. This cd is just what I needed to add to my collection. With the siong that have there own meaning to to people to the have fun tunes. Wiht the song breaking the habit, and numb (myfavoirte songs). If you enjoyed linkin parks first cds then you will love meteora.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I have been a huge Rob fan for many years.  This is by far the best cd Rob has put out.  I highly recommend it to anyone that will listen.  Feel is my favorite song while my 8 year old son loves Hot Fudge.  I hope this is the cd that breaks the US for Rob, we certainly need a break from the music the radio stations torture us with daily!  <br />GO ROB GO!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is an unbelievable album. The amazing way that Chester and Mike can blend together is outstanding. I now have all three albums and i can't really decide which one I like more. Im currently deployed with the army in Afghanistan, i was really looking forward to getting this album and i was without a doubt not dissappointed. Long Live Linkin Park!
B00006CXXU|4.0|OK I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ALBUM. THIS ALBUM IS MORE MATURE, SEXIER, AND MORE ALL GROWN UP. A FEW SONGS STAND OUT LIKE THE SONGS BEAUTIFUL, LOVING ME 4 ME, SOAR, AND FIGHTER. i LIKE IT BECAUSE IT HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC TO IT LIKE POP, R&amp;B,HIP-HOP, JAZZ,SOUL, BLUES, ROCK, AND EVEN GOSPEL FLAVORED LIKE THE SONG KEEP ON SINGING MY SONG. SONGS LIKE DIRRTY ITS OK, BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN IT FOR A FIRST SINGLE, cAN'T HOLD US DOWN IS TIGHT BUT LIL KIM'S RAP IS LAZY AND ANNOYS ME. MOST OF THE TIME I DON'T LISTEN TO POP STARS, BUT I HAVE TO SAY ITS A GREAT ALBUM AND ITS DIFFENT THAN THE OTHER ALBUMS OUT THERE.
B000067CPX|5.0|By The Way marks a change for the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Their evolution from a goofy funk punk band in the early 80's has metamorphosed into a poignant, powerful, rythmic success.  While all their music truly has a place, a palpable change has taken place.  Their last four, major label CD's - Blood Sugar Sex Magik, One Hot Minute, Californication and now By The Way - all include incredible music.  Gradually it has changed from a harder funk sound featuring the likins of George Clinton to a more streamlined alternative album yet all of their ventures have yielded timeless original songs that you'll like the first time you hear and love more and more with each successive listen.  By The Way, while being the least punk funkish is right on par if not better than their earlier albums.  I highly reccomend this CD and its predecessors.  You'll be a Chili Peppers listener for life.
6304097050|5.0|In an era of great middleweights, Sugar Ray beat them all.  He had every attribute of a great fighter: grace, skill, punch, speed, courage, durability.  Undefeated welterweight king, he was five times middleweight champion who collapsed from the heat while leading for the lightheavyweight crown.<br />This is a good summary of his long career, starting with the Golden Gloves.  Oddly enough, it does not mention the draw he fought for the championship at the age of 44 or show the right handed punch that blinded champion Carmen Basilio and enabled Sugar Ray to win the belt again.
B000003S0Z|4.0|This was Eno's fourth and final &quot;song&quot; album, and the only one that I would not give five stars.  It is still a very good album, however.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Here He Comes&quot; (smooth pop bliss), &quot;No One Receiving&quot; (indescribably funky), and &quot;Kurt's Rejoinder&quot; (the bassline will give you whiplash).<br />There are no bad tracks here, and it is probably Eno's most eclectic work.  &quot;King's Lead Hat&quot; sounds like something from the first album, &quot;Backwater&quot; would have fit right in on &quot;Tiger Mountain,&quot; and some of the quiet material on side two is reminiscent of &quot;Another Green World.&quot;<br />I agree with the earlier reviewers who said that this album makes more sense on vinyl because of the radical difference between side one and side two.  I have it on vinyl, along with the three other &quot;song&quot; albums, and though I listen to it less often than &quot;Tiger Mountain&quot; and &quot;Another Green World&quot; (my favorites), I do enjoy it.<br />But it seems that Eno's weariness with songwriting was beginning to show, not in the songs themselves but in the album's lack of cohesion.  I think of &quot;Before and After Science&quot; as a very good collection of singles with tracks 7-9--the quiet ones--fitting together to form a mini-suite.
B00008972S|3.0|When \\"West Side Story\\" hit the Broadway stage it must have shocked theater critics.  A balletic musical about street gangs and murder, with such an emotional swell built in, that even the most hardened cynics must have left the show dewey-eyed and humming the Leonard Berstein score.  The film created nothing less than an international craze and garnered an unprecidented 10 Oscars - the most of any musical.  <BR>PLOT: In a nut shell, this is Romeo and Juliet in the ghetto.  Natilie Wood (dubbed by Marni Nixon) is Maria; poor, Puertorican and in love with Richard Beymer (Tony).  But her brother, Bernardo (George Chakaris) and his girlfriend, Anita (Rita Moreno) don't approve.  If you know your Shakespeare, you know how this one ends.  The difference here are the songs, so electric and outstanding that they easily steal the show.  Try listening to \\"America\\" or \\"I Feel Pretty\\" without tapping your toes or \\"One Hand, One Heart\\" without getting goose-bumps.  It's impossible.  <br />MGM gives us some nice packaging and some extras but let's state the obvious first: this transfer is identical to the one  previously issued on DVD.  Having said that, the transfer is quite good, with a rich bold color scheme and fair solid blacks.  But there are cases where edge enhancement is present and quite obtrusive.  There's also a lot of pixelization in the backgrounds.  <BR>Certain scenes appear slightly out of focus, while others are so sharp that even with your televsion sharpness turned to zero, the image is rather hard to look at on the screen.  <BR>The soundtrack is very strident.  Songs are presented at an explosive listening level that really rocks the house.  But other bits of dialogue are soft or muffled.  Some of the songs have a grating high pitch to them that really strains the ear.  A moderate listening level is recommended to fully appreciate this audio.<BR>Now for the extras - for starters we get a very handsome book  that contains the entire script as well as personal reflections from the producers and cast and newspaper clippings of the initial reviews.  The print quality of the book is okay, but the photo image quality herein is simply unacceptable, with smeared images of original stills and others that have faded colors.  <BR>Since this is a two-disc set, the movie is on disc one, with the option to listen and view with or without the intermission music - a very nice touch.  Disc 2 contains a documentary \\"West Side Memories\\" that is somewhat disappointing in that not all the cast members have their say.  <BR>Missing from the proceedings are George Chakaris (Bernardo) who is still alive and should have been included.  Yes, Natalie Wood is no longer with us but I find it hard to believe that she never gave any sound bytes to the press ever, with regard to her participation on the film.  Marni Nixon, who dubbed for Natalie is also not present to lend her expertise and talk about the art of dubbing, which she did plenty of during Hollywood's golden age. There's also no Ernest Lehman - odd,  considering how active he's been on other special edition DVD's.  <BR>This documentary is self-congratulatory and pretty much plays it safe.  The premiere and the film's enduring popularity are glossed over.  <BR>On disc 2 we get the isolated intermission music presented a second time - for what reason, I'm not sure - presumably to fill disc space.  There's also a montage of stills set to music and no less than five theatrical trailers - all of them looking pretty dull and worn out.  Lastly, we get a shameless add from MGM, promoting its other DVD releases.  That's pretty much it.  A real waste of a second disc if you ask me.  Yes, the documentary is fairly comprehensive, but it could have fit on side two of a flipper disc.  Yes, the book is a nice companion piece but it's not printed with high quality in mind.  The handsome packaging on the exterior hints to more hidden treasures than are actually found inside.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: A genuine work ofart.  The transfer is nice, just not pristine. The extras are okay, but don't really live up to the excitement one has before taking the plastic wrapper off.
B00008GKEG|4.0|First off, I love the Beatles. There has not been a better band before or since, and I doubt there ever will. And I love this anthology - especially with the extra 80 minute disc addition! What could be better? The other positive reviews before mine explain most of the reasons why you should own this set, so there's no reason for me to re-iterate what they have said so elequently.<br />So why four stars instead of five?<br />Well, let's put it this way: whoever remastered this for DVD messed with perfection - that is, they remixed much of the music pretty poorly. No, not the sound quality, but by subtly changing the original mixes. For example (hopefully, this makes sense), when the group is lip-syncing to &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; on Ed Sullivan's show, Paul's &quot;oooh&quot; heard toward the end (over George's infamous one note spear sound he gets from his guitar) has been re-edited to be sung every time George plays that note. &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; has John's vocals mixed noticeably out front with the Shakespearian recitation buried and virtually unheard at the end. &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; lost most of its reverb, and on &quot;Revolution,&quot; the mixer who did the mixing mixed in the original recording with their live performance - compare Paul's opening scream to the VHS version to hear what I mean. Same with &quot;Hey Jude.&quot;<br />Call me picky, but I'm a traditionalist. Give me the original, the way it was meant to be heard. Personally, I feel they did this as kind of their own little 'watermark' to possibly prevent anyone from copying anything. If this is the case (I have no proof that it is, but it makes sense), then it's ridiculous. We are true Beatle fans who deserve The Real Thing.<br />Now, that said, I still give it a four star rating because, except for the above silliness, it's still a remarkable and must own set for Beatle and music fans in general. Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, it is not at all boring. This is a yearly watch for me and my family and we learn something new at each viewing.<br />Highly recommended!or me and my family and we learn something new at each viewing.<BR>Highly recommended!
B00008H2LB|5.0|If you've heard Linkin Park in the past (Reanimation notwithstanding) then Meteora will sound very familiar. Every member of the band gels better than in Hybrid Theory, that's for sure, but there's little beyond the formulaic sound that's become known as LP. Personally, I love it. Chester and Mike know each other's talents and abilities, and show off the excellent lyrical chemistry that enables such a large band to perform so well... and it's a great CD to impress friends with the new system in the car (Lying From You especially), but after the first minute or so of each song, the formula is adhered to. So why did I give it five stars? Simple. LP's sound is maturing, it's enhanced with bonuses, there's no filler, the cd is great. LP put enough effort into this CD to crank out three hours of drivel... or a short CD that rocks.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Yep, it's sort of interesting that in the short, short space of thirty-six minutes, Linkin Park still manage to sound repetitive and boring.  You've really got to hand it to Chester and the lads, they must really have worked hard to get it to sound this bad.<br />I heartily recommend a band like Liquid or Deftones instead of this.  In fact, I recommend pretty much anything instead of this!
B00005JLO2|3.0|It would seem that the themes of Four Feathers, cowardice, courage, honor, etc. can be re-examined by each film making generation.  What else can explain so many versions of this oft-made story.  The original A.E.W. Mason novel is a slow Victorian read, and no film has yet to do it true honor scene for scene.  This current version, while impressive visually, is spoiled by the politically correct overtones of its producer.  Should we be surprised that an East Indian director would become mired in his own confused feelings about the British empire.  The result is history re-written to make this individual feel better about himself.<br /><br />The numerous historical inaccuracies of this film start right off with the Royal Cumbrians.  No such regiment existed in the British army!  This is not so bad because the older 1939 version also depicted a make-believe regiment - The Royal North Surreys.  They do have a better sounding title though! If this were the only problem with the film it would be fine.  But the producer proceeds to invent a fortress of Abu Klea which the British never had and thus was never taken.  Then he further distorts matters by totally corrupting the major battle scene of the film - the battle of Abu Klea.  This battle was fought in 1885 when the British were trying to relieve General Gordon at Khartoum.  The British Camel Corps was involved, not an Anglo-Egyptian infantry force that is shown here.  Again, we could survive these  minor details.  The major fallacy here is that it is shown as a British defeat.  Which it was not.  True, the Mahdists did break the defending British square briefly, and Kipling even wrote a poem to salute that event, but the film does not show that the square was reformed and all the Dervish that managed to break inside were either killed or driven out. The Mahdist cavalry charging with red jackets is also pure fiction. The British in fact defeated the Mahdist hordes, inflicting over a thousand casualties for less than a hundred lost themselves. The British were also no longer wearing red jackets by this time as well, but we have to see those red coats in order to vilify the evil British!<br /><br />The battle depicted here is well done, but factually wrong and a distortion of history.  What do you expect from an Indian director who is trying to get revenge on the British empire!  The shame of movies like this is that they seduce the viewer into thinking this is all factual content.  Many films today have become not-so-subtle vehicles for revisionist history.  Most movie directors are pundits for the politically correct crowd of Hollywood.<br /><br />Movies like this can be enjoyed for their often fine production value, but should be balanced by reading the actual histoy of the events they portray.  To do otherwise is to fall victem to the propaganda they preach here.  Balance this film with the original 1939 classic directed by the Korda brothers and the fine 1970 film Khartoum with Lawrence Olivier giving a chilling performance as the murderous Mahdi - a fanatic of Islam which would look very familar to us today.d lost themselves.

B000088E6D|5.0|It seems David Foster knows his business and has a knack at recognizing and guiding great talents. First Josh Groban, now Michael Bubl - incredible! While Josh stoked the fires for 'popera', I'm sure Bubl will do the same for the love songs of the past 5 decades. <BR>&quot;That's All&quot; is beautiful, and &quot;How can you mend a broken heart&quot; is another song that touches your soul. <BR>All said, it's just a remarkably well produced disc that features a crooner who's certainly gifted.
B00005YW4H|5.0|It makes a great coaster for drinks in any postmodern house.
B00000DGUM|5.0|Harken back to the days of Sebastian Bach's over the top vocals....and those rip roaring metal guitars that made you throw your fist in the air in pure rebellion !!  The \\"youth\\" were \\"wild\\" and they lead a legion of fun seeking teens through the heights of the 80's.  The neat thing about Skid Row was that they truly had talent....they didn't rely on stage antics or costumes to carry them....they were raw, jagged wires that understood how to pump up a crowd !!  Songs like \\"18 and Life\\", \\"I'll Remeber You\\", \\"Quicksand Jesus\\" and of course \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" will remain in hearts and minds of those that grew up on \\"heavy metal\\"......buy this one just for the sheer guilty pleasure of it all and crank it up in the car....the guy at the stop light next to you will enjoy the show !!
B00008J4P5|3.0|I will admit the first time I heard this album it sounded great.  Unfortunately the album wears thin with every listen after that.  I guess I could attribute this to the fact that this album is based more on gimmicks and over-hype, than it does on creating something that will stand the test of time.  In my opinion this whole garage revival is turning into one big clich.  It's just a matter of time before it follows the in the footsteps of Nu-Metal, Grunge, Hairbands, and every other &quot;movement&quot; that has placed the genre's rules over it's own originality.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Without question 2pac is the greatest rapper who has ever lived, if you weren't convinced by &quot;Me Against The World&quot; this album pretty much proves it. This is 2pac's most commercial album without question it produced 6 hit singles and sold millions of copies. There are also many underrated tracks on this album; Ambitionz Az A Ridah, Got My Mind Made Up, No More Pain, Only God Can Judge Me, Can't C Me, Holla At Me, Ratha Be Ya N..., All Eyez On Me, and Ain't Hard To Find. This would still be a great album even without the hit songs; All Bout U, How Do You Want It, 2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted, Heartz Of Men, Life Goes On, California Love, I Ain't Mad At Cha, and Picture Me Rollin' all of which are featured on 2pac's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. If you weren't keeping track that's 17 excellent songs, even the ones I didn't mention are still good. The production is great throughout the entire double disk set thanks mostly to Daz, Dr. Dre, and Johnny &quot;J&quot;. There are also plenty of great guest artists; The Outlaws, Nate Dogg, Daz, Kurupt, Method Man, Redman, KC &amp; Jo Jo, Snoop Dogg, Rappin' 4-Tay, Dr. Dre, Danny Boy, Big Syke, CPO, Richie Rich, E-40, B-Legit, and C-Bo. It's hard to say if this is indeed 2pac's best album, personally I like &quot;Me Against The World&quot; a tad bit more, but anyone who considers themselves a fan of Rap music should have this classic album.
0805062971|4.0|fight club is a very good tight book, but you might i thought david fincher did a better job with playing around with palahniuk's material. the style is loose, irreverent and lyrical. the story is dark, violent and extremely confronting. towards the end the story slacks off a little- maybe so because i had fincher's film in mind. fight club as it is a economical in storytelling, but fincher made it tighter, and no doubt, better.
B0000013G9|5.0|I'm not a huge R&amp;B fan. I have some of the requisites, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Otis Redding, but nothing more recent. I bought Crazysexycool because I read some pretty good reviews. Well, after listening I am quite impressed. I really enjoyed how the theme Crazysexycool permeated the entire album and kept coming back again and again. I also thought the use of guest appearances was handled expertly. I especially liked Switch. I stay away from format radio so I never heard any of these songs before putting the cd in my player. I think this is a good thing. This cd should be taken as a whole and not a sum of its parts.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I thought Hybrid Theory was one of the best CDs I have listened to.  Just about every song made me want to bounce with the music and shout the chorus or belt out the rap.  It is because of this that I had such high expectations for Meteora.  After listening to it a handfull of times, however, I feel a bit let down.  Many of the songs sound very cool and new, especially &quot;Faint&quot;.  If this CD was made by a new band, everyone would be nuts about it.  However, because Meteora is by Linkin Park, we all expect it to be just as good as Hybrid Theory.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think we should give Linking Park a break because they set the standard so high.  It's the good bands (ie The Beatles) that can pump out good albums one after another.  Anyway, I feel that the album has some nice, new sounds and &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; reminds me of songs from Hybrid Theory.  I don't really have a problem with the shortness of it; Hybrid Theory was only 2 minutes longer and I didn't hear too much complaining about it.  Meteora's length probably has just come under closer scrutiny due to its quality compared to Hybrid Theory. <BR>     So overall I would give Meteora a 3.5 with .5 taken off because of my expectations, .5 taken off because many of the songs sound similar, and another .5 because its not perfect.  For LP fans, I would definitely buy it because hey it's Linkin Park.  For everyone else, buy Hybrid Theory or for those of you who are concerned about length, buy Reanimation.
B000069AUI|3.0|I listened to this one over and over trying to figure out who the guy &quot;really&quot; sounds like....its not Bono or Radiohead...its Grant Lee Buffalo.  The lead vocalist is fantastic...not many will dispute that, however, the songs all rely on his voice to carry them !!  The rest of the band needs to step up and learn a few new chords.....each song contains 2-3 which are beaten over their instruments repeatedly.  The guitar and piano melodies become too bland because there is little change in the song....no refrain, no chorus, etc....which is ok for one or two songs but to bang on the same chords for a whole album doesn't say much for the musicianship of the rest of the band.  The sales on this album are big....big enough that I would advise the lads to seek out a lead guitarist that can occassionally shine over the rhythm section.  If haunting melodies is your thing....check out Grant Lee Buffalo or Radiohead....they do them much better !!
B00001MXXH|5.0|I grew up in the 80's and couldnt wait to get this on dvd.  The 5.1 sound makes it sound even better.  Of course the computer technology that Ferris is &quot;hacking&quot; is funny to look at now... it was cutting edge at one time.  The dvd version is great and if you are a product of the 80's like me.. then you must get this one!!
B00006RINF|5.0|how can a band be so amazing and still be unfamous.  For everyone pondering this cd, go for it.  This is one of the most musicly/lyricaly talented bads i have herd in a while.  Not overly heavy or bland the coil takes you on a ride through dreamland.  This cd is a perfect blend of lyrics and music.  The best part, they flow.  The production on this album is rediculously amazing.  The track arangement takes you on an emotional spiral.  Perfect for any mood.  Int he world of modern rock, the coil brings an emotion to the table unmatchable by any band.  And if u like these guys, check out Evanescence, they are also amazing.
B00008972S|5.0|This new release of &quot;West Side Story&quot; on DVD is a masterstroke of entertainment.: a perfect blend of music, choreography, and talent, such that the screen hasn't seen since the making of this film.<br />Now I must admit that I haven't been a huge fan of this film prior. It seems that the two other times that I tried watching this, I actually fell asleep. I knew that I wanted to like this movie, and now, after watching the DVD release of this movie, I understand why.<br />The transfer of the film to DVD is flawless. The movie looks sumptous and rich, the sound incredible, and the music soars. Every performance in the film, from Russ Tamblyn to Natalie Wood to Rita Moreno, and so on and so on, is powerful and compelling. The huge dancing numbers are visually mesmerizing, you get lost in the middle of them constantly.<br />In fact, the directing of Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins is inspiring. I hate it when  you have a large dance number, and it suffers by having to view closeup after closeup without ever being able to see the entire number. Robbins and Wise pull back and allow the dancing to speak for itself. I only wish other directors would realize you don't need a thousand cuts in a dance number to make it exciting.<br />When purchasing DVDs, I tend to look beyond the simple inclusion of  the movie when rating a set. This DVD is loaded, and I mean LOADED with goodies. Not only do you get the movie, but it comes with an interesting documentary, trailers, behind the scene photos, and even includes a &quot;scrapbook&quot; of the script complete with pictures and other information. This DVD has set the standard for all other DVD releases in the future.<br />So come on, enjoy the Sharks, Jets, their fighting, dancing, all set in the arms of an amazing love story. No wonder AFI chose this as one of the 100 best films of all time. This new DVD collection is one of the best of all time as well.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I loved it. A definite must have for any Beatle fan. The Special Feature section is probably the best part. It shows the then 3 surviving Beatles coming together and reminiscing about the past - George Harrison's sense of humour is something that I truly enjoyed watching! I would also recommend reading the book before viewing the DVD's ... gives you a little more insight.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I have been a rabid fan of Beck for years...from his days as slacker poet spokesperson to his development as ultra hip beats collageist (Odelay), I love One Foot in the Grave and Stereopathetic Soulmanure, Mutations was a fascinating update to his folk roots, Midnight Vultures was surprising but good.  You'd think that by now he would have lost his power to amaze.  But no, with this album he redefined himself again, sneaking away from his white boy soulman persona to his greatest height of genius to date.<br />I've learned to expect the unexpected from this artist and still he managed to create a beautiful record of sophistication and quality which I think actually compares in greatness to some of the all-time classics like Pet Sounds.  Not to say that it sounds like Pet Sounds--but the lush orchestration, the deft arrangements, and the exchanging of Beck's formerly amusing, nonsensical (yet somehow intelligent)lyrics for the sad, tenderly emotive words on this album is the last thing I would have expected from the ever-unpredictible, quintiessential artist of our time.<br />This is an album for those whose hearts have been broken, a far cry from the unabashed humor of Beck's earlier work.  And with this album Beck shows that he is just as capable of producing honest, moving, and emotionally compelling music as he is with all of his previous musical ventures.  Yes this album is sad, but in a way that will make you feel better.  Before, when I was feeling sad and wanted to revel in my lonliness from love gone awry I usually had to put in something like The Cure or Smashing Pumpkins. But now I have a Beck album to add among those esteemed discs of loss.<br />Make no mistake tho--if you love beatiful music you will find yourself repeatedly listening to this disc whether you are sad or not--to revel in the beauty created by the softer side of this wonderful artist, a side of his work and heart that we had never glimpsed before.<br />In closing... &quot;Its only lies that I'm living/Its only tears that I'm crying/Its only you that I'm losing/Guess I'm doing fine.&quot;
B00005OAIE|4.0|Righ to the point. He can't be yet compared to the genius Dave Matthews but he sure beats guys like Jack Johnson. Love this cd. I am not to much as a pop fan but this kind of pop really does it for me. Not all Pop is bad they say. And the thing I love most is even if theres a acoustic album this album also have that air and I love it. &quot;Not Such Thing&quot;  &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; great songs... he takes some of the finest jazz progressions and puts them into the pop action. I think theres is a great fusion if you do it well. I like the lyrics but sometimes thats his failure, trying to be much as a Dave Matthews... be yourself... don't try to change simple lines... sometimes simple is better.<br />&quot;Back To You&quot; &quot;Your Body...&quot; great songs. Great lyrics.<br />So if you want to get started with this young felow I think this a better choice than Inside Wants Out, I think he was pushed into it and this album is more the idea he had about these songs.<br />He will become the DM of the future. But he have to proove he is &quot;the one&quot;.
B0000691U1|5.0|The Duke is the king. He was huge. Too much recent writing bogs down in arguments whether Strayhorn got enough credit, whether Hodges or Nanton or Williams were showcased properly.  These writers, came to the banquet late, and are squabbling over table scraps. Ellington dominated the jazz world from the mid-1920s until he died in 1974. Ellington was the vanguard.  This CD is one to prove it.<br />The year is 1962.  Big bands are dinosaurs. Ellington's orchestra still performs, but dance hall venues of the 30s and 40s went out with the war. He's been doing studio work, some with the band, some with smaller ensembles. Everyone wants to record with the Duke. This time out he's with the angriest man in jazz, Charlie Mingus, the Black Saint himself. How did they do? Unbelievable. <br />Here's Duke, elegant, sophisticated, and smooth. He plays piano in the parlor. Probably in the Hamptons. Max Roach accompanies discreetly with brushes and cymbals. You can almost hear the whispers of liveried waiters circulating with champagne and canapés. But beneath this frothy party, up through the floorboards, comes a rumbling, and a thumping. Not a guest at the party, what you hear is an unpresentable, dangerous member of the family.  Locked away for the night, he's Charlie Mingus, the beast in the basement, down there, pounding away at the foundations. <br />Max reacts. Brushes, cymbals and the quiet pretense of elegance, give way to sticks and traps and a harder edge- \\"Duke,\\" he says, \\"Duke, you hear that?\\" The Duke doesn't answer right away.  It's like maybe he didn't hear it, but then, when he answers, he answers with a discord. \\"Is that what you mean?\\" Another discord, \\"You mean that?\\" \\"Yeah, Duke, that's it.  That's what I mean.\\" <br />Bit by bit Duke and Max pick up Charlie's themes.  Duke, over sixty, he's seen it all, commiserates with Mingus, the quintessential angry 60s black man. \\"Yeah, Charlie, we know, Charlie. We're angry, too, Charlie. It's not just you. You're not alone, Charlie.\\" They grumble, angry together. But with age comes wisdom, and sweetness, and forgiveness, and after a bit, Duke hits a nice round churchy gospel chord. \\"C'mon, Chuck, lighten up.\\" Another gospel chord. Max cracks a joke. And Mingus mellows. <br />The trio hits a nice rhythm.  A bit of harmony, even. \\"Wanna come upstairs, Charlie?  Join the party?\\" And, after a bit, he does, walleyed and nervous in the bright light. \\"You understand, Duke, this is just for you? I'm only doing this for you.\\" He really doesn't like these people, but still--  It's better than the basement. <br />Mingus never really is comfortable in the parlor. And as long as he's upstairs, the guests look at the waiters with apprehension.  This bass player, you know, he could lead a revolution. But Mingus likes jazz, and he likes the Duke.  Duke's not just one of those lard-butted bandleaders, he's one of-  Aw, man, forget `one of',  he's the BEST jazz piano player EVER. so sit up and listen or Mingus will kick your--
B00008MNYS|5.0|(Listen carefully to the lryics to understand the title of this review.)<BR>Robbie is a true superstar! He is an amazing singer, entertainer, song writer and such a cute, cheeky young man. :) This album is excellent! It has a slightly different sound than his older albums, but still top-notch. His lyrics are personal and revealing. His music is fun and his voice is stunning. A blend of Freddie Mercury and Elton John, but still very unique. Some songs are quite cheeky and funny &quot;Me and My Monkey&quot;, but others show how sweet and sensitive this amazing brit is, &quot;Nan's Song&quot;. I recommend this to anyone struggling with life and love, anyone who likes a good time. This is an awesome album, everyone should pick up a copy. America needs to discover this international superstar!
B00008H2LB|1.0|This album treads most of the same ground that Hybrid Theory already explored.  Needless to say that ground is the radius of a dime.  The music plays the same format over and over, from a distance it sounds like Hybrid Theory.<br />Who can blame Linkin Park for sticking with what works?  As long as it keeps them on top, musical development can take a back seat to musical progression.  For those that liked the previous effort Meteora makes a good companion.  For those hoping the band would become other than a highly popular flash in the pan, the jury is out.
B00008GKEG|5.0|If you enjoyed the version that aired on ABC in 1995, you'll enjoy this 100% more. After viewing this, I realized there had been some thoughtless editing done to the aired version which really detracted form the original product.  It's funny how mindless ... like Survivor or American Idol gets plenty of air time on weekly t.v., but they had to butcher this to fit it into the schedule. I figure there was as much as 30 minutes (quite possibly more!) shaved off some of the eight episodes.  ABC managed to squeeze 2 episodes, each of which average about 75 minutes into two hours per night, including commercials!?  This original version is much more solid and progresses very nicely through the Beatles career and includes many interesting 'little' tidbits that realy add a lot of charm to the anthology, and this was the way it was meant to be experienced. With the complete original footage plus the new bonus footage, it runs about twice as long as when originally aired on television.  The picture is crystal clear, and the sound is fantastic!  This is something everyone, no matter how die hard a fan, should see.  Beatlemania was a significant time in history and was truly amazing!...
B000068TPN|5.0|As a Viet Vet, I found the military story breath-taking. The emotions of the men, thier families and thier spiritual connection made me relive my own experience.  <br />A major distraction from an excellent film was the Oliver Stone style fairy-tale about delivering death notices by telegram via a taxi driver only to be taken over by a military officer's wife.  That is an insult to the military service that I hope will be corrected.  Following my Viet Nam tour I was assigned duty which included Casualty Assistance Calls (CACO).  The notification required military officers and, whenever possible, Chaplain and Medical- Personnel even at places remote from military bases. <br />Keeping this historical fact in mind, the film remains a memorable event.<br />Ray Kahler, USN Retired
B00004R99R|3.0|Hercules is rarely grouped with Disney's more popular movies of the 90's such as The Lion King, Beauty And The Beast and Aladdin, but that doesn't mean it's expendable.  As Disney films go this one is pretty good fun, and is actually the favourite of several of my friends in college.  The story is simple enough: Hercules is stolen from Mount Olympia and is turned human, but manages to maintain his godlike strength.  Handed down to an orphan family he is deemed a misfit because of his strength and starts training with satyr Phil (DeVito) to become a real hero and return to his rightful home.  Of course, things aren't that easy, with Hades (Woods) and true love in the form of feisty Meg getting in the way of our hero's path.<br />Many people have complained that Hercules doesn't really incorporate the reality of the Greek myth, which is true for the most part, but the kind of self-knowing sidenotes to the overblown myths and legends of Greek history make the movie seem much fresher than if they'd rigidly stuck to a storyline.  In fact, adults jokes about Oedipus Rex, where Hercules jokes that he thought he had problems with his family, is hilarious and shouldn't have been dispensed with for the world.  Although at times it can seem like Hercules tries to hard to get in a little bit of every Greek legend of the time - Orpheus, Theseus and of course Hercules are all there - it does so in a bright and enjoyable way.<br />The supporting actors, as is usual for all Disney movies, remain the most memorable.  James Woods makes a great villain, and Danny DeVito is likewise great value as Phil.  Plus, following in a recent tradition, lead girl Meg is more than just a pretty face but an actual character, spouting more than a bit of feminism, making her a lot more interesting than, say, Cinderella.  However, whilst there's nothing really implicitely wrong here, Hercules fails to stand out as a classic of the Disney canon.  The songs are bland (sung here by Ricky Martin) and unimaginative and although it seems originally like Hercules was going to be set up as a big strong nerd, he quickly turns into the kind of boring hero that you least wanted to see.  The film also seems too short, and Hercules' discovery that he is in fact adopted is handled in a surprisingly slapdash manner for what is quite a controversial subject (at least for Disney).  Still, they're only small quibbles and Hercules really is very good, just no classic.
B00008BRB5|4.0|Sorry, folks...In my original review (&quot;In Defense of Mother&quot;), I said this album was thirty years old.  Actually, it's only twenty.  Hey, I never claimed I was any good at math!
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes are back again with Elephant.  Being a lukewarm fan of the last effort I had my reservations about the new LP.  Elephant is a very pleasant surprise.  Jack White's songwriting talent has definitely risen to the next level.  The album is a joy to listen straight though.<br />Even the tongue and cheek track at the end of the record fits into the landscape that the White Stripes have crafted.  While there is not quite the &quot;catchy&quot; song that White Blood Cells had the overall sound of Elephant is much better.  &quot;I just don't know what do with myself,&quot; &quot;Seven Nation Army,&quot; &quot;I want to be the boy,&quot; and &quot;There's No Home for You Here&quot; are some of the standout tracks.  The White Stripes will be one of the premier acts to catch this summer on tour.  Purchase the record to hear why.
B00008AWOD|5.0|Four amazing albums in a row!!!  Sleeping With Ghosts is a spectacular display of why Placebo fans really love Placebo.  The men of Placebo put out brilliant albums and allow us to live their songs...this isn't just music, it's a spiritual connection to the lyrics, drums, keyboards, guitars, and Brian Molko's amazing voice.  This voice is the most imperfect perfect voice in rock.  Pick up this cd and the other three...you will not be disappointed.  My favs from this album are:  the title track (lovely), Special Needs (classic), Second Sight, The Bitter End (aggressively beautiful), Centerfolds (soo moving), ...hell, I love them all.  Brilliant!!!!
B000002HH9|5.0|The most textured, elevated Cure album. Robert Smith at his peak. It's got edge, great grooves, love songs, fantastic poetry, incredible flow to the whole lineup of songs. Every album up to this one is great too. Unfortunately, Smith should have ended it here because Blood Flowers is just rehash.
6305736650|5.0|The story is great, the script is quick and snappy and the chemistry is one of a kind. What is amazing about this movie is that after 60 years, even with most of it's famous lines having entered our modern vernacular, it hasn't lost its edge. Upon viewing again last night with a friend who has not seen it, I realized that this is essential viewing for those who want an introduction to &quot;Classic&quot; Hollywood.<br />The film makes the transition nicely in DVD format. While it does not have a lot of the bells and whistles that usually accompany a popular film, it really doesent need to. The movie is strong enough to stand alone without a commentary by a surving cast member or a &quot;film scholar.&quot; It has a short and sweet documentary hosted by Lauren Bacall and a bevvy of trailers for other films starring Bogey. That feature I actually found helpful since I myself am always looking to increase my knowledge of classic film. This is an excellent purchase and one you will not see once and leave on your shelf to collect dust. You find yourself coming back to this one again and again.

B000056K04|2.0|First DMB CD, I think I bought the wrong one
0743244249|5.0|This book is so musical and poetic that I immediately began reading it again after finishing. Knowing the entire story, which you may because some of the reviews have nothing better to do but tell you it, ruins nothing. It is inspiring, too. It has totally got me back into wanting to learn about our culture. Because you wonder, how could DeLillo possibly have learned so much about to write the things in here? I want a subscription to Harper's and I'm going to start reading The Financial Times again. I'm reading Doug Henwood's book \\"Wall Street\\" to get a handle on the financial sector. Eric, the billionaire main character, has a Chief of Theory working for him in his investment firm, and boy can she rip it up on the waxing theoretical, so I'm (trying to) read Frederic Jameson's \\"Postmodernism: Or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism\\" to get my brain back into that mode. But ultimately, we're talking about genius here. The things DeLillo can write about a skyscraper in New York are not things a normal person could think of, no matter what her research background. Yes, they're just words. Just like the human brain is just building blocks. But their arrangements are sublime, not capable of being merely calculated-they must be divinely inspirationally invented. I think 9/11 did something to DeLillo, because his writing has been cranked up to the next level. But I guess everything does things to DeLillo.
0553801511|5.0|In order to appreciate this book, one needs to start at the beginning of this series--not Tawny Man 1: Fool's Errand, but Farseer 1: Assassin's Apprentice.  SO MUCH is lost if a reader neglects the previous trilogy or even skips books.  <br />Hobb's great prose brings the reader back.  There is more revealed about the Skill and Out Islands, and characters such as Kettricken and Dutiful, but less emphasis on the White Prophet/Catalyst roles in history.  This book, like Royal Assassin, feels more like a transition than a stand alone book since its beginning and conclusion are found in the other books, but it cannot be left out.<br />This isn't as great an emotional roller coaster or action thriller as the two or three preceeding it, but it definitely sets up a good third book. As usual, Hobb leaves a cliffhanger ending, so you'll want Tawny Man 3 NOW as soon as you've finished it.
B00004Z459|1.0|first off, i have seen, heard, and read alot about this band. and the first thing i want to say is Linkin Park is not metal, rap-core, nu-metal, or anything like that. they are a pop band thru and thru. i saw these guys when they were just starting out and they were trying to promote &quot;One step closer&quot;. back then they were trying to do the nu-metal thing, although they were never very good at it. then one day i hear one of these songs at the doctors office on a pop/mix station. in my opinion thats where they sould stay, with the likes of Creed, and Matchbox 20. if you want to here hard core music with good melodies you should check out Diecast or Stuck Mojo, you'll see the difference.
1881273156|5.0|I bought this book and read it and I loved I was so excited the whole time reading it plus it helped me understand myself and my needs so much better.  Before I had so much trouble expressing in words the thoughts in my head.  This book was so enlightening.  Even if you aren't married or involved this book will help you understand yourself and how you got to that way.  How refreshing is it to be able to say to your partner (new or old) I am a physical touch kind of person you want to show me love this is how!  Also the questions in the back were helpful for my own self awareness.  I loved it Thank you so much Dr. Chapman.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is surely one of the best cds that will be released this year. I like every song on this one. It's even better than their last album and that is saying a lot. I just hope people will listen to this cd and give this act a chance because they are one of only a handful of artists making great music. My favorite song has to be &quot;Ball and Biscuit.&quot; It is a straight rockin' blues song that gets better with each listen. &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot; is another great song. In fact, all of the songs are so good that I couldn't begin to praise them individually! Two words sum up this album &quot;PLAY LOUD!&quot;
B00008MNYS|5.0|I have been a Robbie Williams fan for several years and have all of his CDs, but I have to say that Escapology is his best album yet.  I loved every one of the songs and can listen to the CD all the way through without skipping any songs.  All of the songs are so well-written and sung beautifully.  His first single off the album, &quot;Feel&quot;, is the perfect song to display Robbie's vocal abilities, along with &quot;Love Somebody&quot;.  I particularly enjoy the humerous &quot;Handsome Man&quot; and the rock-influenced &quot;How Peculiar&quot;.<BR>Although you will find rock, pop, and maybe even a little country influence on this album, Robbie simply can't be compared to any other artist out there.  I hope more people here in the US will discover his music - it would be a shame if they didn't.
B000083E79|5.0|Back in the 60's if one was to say that the young, dark-haired hippie chick of the duo Sonny and Cher would have one of the longest careers in pop music history, they probably would've been laughed off the face of the earth. But it's true. Cher's career has lated through 5 decades. Always evolving, she's kept up with the times. This collection represents that evolution magnificently. You get 60's Cher as part of &quot;Sonny and Cher.&quot; You have story-song/ disco Cher for the 70's. Then there's 80's rock chick Cher followed by 90's surprise comeback Cher. Then finally new millennium dance/club Cher.<br />This collection kicks off with the biggest hit of her career, the astounding 1999 #1 hit &quot;Believe&quot; *which was also the biggest single of that year. You then get her successful 80's rock/pop material ranging from the #3 power-ballad &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; to the top 10 &quot;I Found Someone.&quot; And who can resist her duet with Peter Centura &quot;After All&quot; *which hit #6.* Also featured is the minor hit &quot;One By One&quot; followed by two 90's dance hits &quot;Strong Enough&quot; and the very catchy &quot;All Or Nothing.&quot; &quot;Song For the Lonely&quot; is on here also from her 2001 release &quot;Living Proof&quot; as is one of my personal Cher favorites &quot;A Different Kind of Love Song.&quot; Then you het her old-school 60's/ 70's hits including the #1's &quot;Half Breed,&quot; &quot;Gypsies Tramps and Theives,&quot; and &quot;Dark Lady.&quot; Also her #1 signature duet with Sonny &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; and &quot;The Beat Goes On.&quot; Another one of my Cher preferences is included which is &quot;All I Really Wanna Do&quot; *which unfortunately was not included on her previous &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; compilation.<br />The question is, was this collection really necesarry considering she just had a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; come out in '99. Well, you do get the hits from her last two releases &quot;Believe&quot; and &quot;Living Proof&quot; which were not included. There are also a few that were left off on &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; including &quot;One By One,&quot; &quot;All I Really Wanna Do,&quot; and &quot;The Beat Goes On.&quot; So, if you're looking for these songs, don't hesitate! This isn't totally up to perfection seeing how &quot;The Way of Love&quot; and &quot;Love and Understanding&quot; were left off, but oh well. Still, a great career retrospective.
B000089RVX|5.0|I went out and bought this cd after seeing the movie Daredevil. It is great!!! I haven't heard original music in quite a while because it seems as though everyone wants to sound like everyone else. I applaud Evanescence. This CD was well worth the money.
0767810856|5.0|I am glad that this movie is available on DVD because it's a great &quot;feel good&quot; movie!  Nicolas Cage plays a mild mannered cop who, one day, can't leave a tip for a cup of coffee, so he offers his waitress (Bridget Fonda) his lottery ticket.  It's funny to see the chain of events that happen throughout the movie.  It's a romantic comedy that will keep you watching right to the end!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is an incredible daunting album.  The Vocalist is just amazing!!! Lyrics and the arrangment of instruments were put together with  a true creativeness that you just can't find in today's \\"proper\\" music...THIS BAND WILL BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME!!!
B000083E79|5.0|This is the album we have all been waiting for.  A career that spans 4 decades has produced some memorable and quality music, and this album showcases the talent of a woman loved the world over.  If you don't own a Cher album, but like her music, then this is the album to buy.  Packed full of her classic and new music, including &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot; and &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; with Sonny.  How can you resist buying this album?<br />And it must be mentioned that not only does Cher still produce fabulous music, but wow! she looks absolutely amazing these days!
B00005YW4H|4.0|You can't be dissapointed with this CD unless you bought it thinking it was rap or hip-hop. The music is absolutely relaxing, paused, and let you forget the hard day at work. You can listen to it while you are reading or while you stare at the window watching the time goes by, you'll enjoy it! (Oops! it sounds like Casablanca). I heard someone saying that Norah Jones let the songs BREATH, and I think that's the best way to describe how she sings.<BR> <BR>Some critics have said that some of her songs sound just the same, and in my opinion it's true; but it is not a bad thing at all because if you like one song (you've maybe heard on the radio) you're going to be sure you'll like the whole CD.<br />My favorites are:<BR>&quot;Come away with me&quot;, simply the best of the album; &quot;Don't know why&quot;, this was the only one I knew before I bought the CD; &quot;I've got to see you again&quot;
B00005JLKN|5.0|I dreaded this movie being made because I enjoyed the book so much, but I was very pleasantly surprised! Not only is this a very good movie, with very believable actors for all the characters. It is also a wonderful example of how to turn a book into a movie!
B000062YAZ|5.0|This disc is just beyond words. From the initial \\"Angel of Death\\" riff and inhuman scream to the falling rain on \\"Raining Blood\\", you will just feel like someone is shooting adrenaline right into your vein. This is not actually my favorite Slayer album (that would be South of Heaven), but it has the best thrash metal song ever on my opinon - \\"Postmortem\\". You gotta listen to it.
B00008J4P5|5.0|What can I say?  I never ever thought that this band could improve with classics such as De Stijl and White Blood Cells.  This is a special band, their gimmick (red, white or black in their clothing and mainly guitar and drums)helps more than you think.  When you think of The White Stripes the first image that runs through your head is the red, white and black.  The next thing is that they're an excellent band who don't believe their own hype. They keep on slugging away like a band that doesn't have an audience or any critical acclaim.  It's as if they're oblivious to the fact that critics adore them and that they're getting bigger around the world as I type this.  <br />     Let's get to the album.  When I heard the bassline in Seven Nation Army I was PLEASANTLY surprised.  I know that's not something that they've used before but I always thought that it would've been nice to put some bass in their previous albums, it seems like they heard me.  Black Math is your typical Stripes sound, I really loved the grinding guitar sound one minute into the song, it absolutely hit me from another angle.  Jesus, I could get into so much detail for the rest of the way but there's 14 songs to talk about and I nor you have the patience to read it all.  I wonder if the The Strokes can repeat or better their performance on their first album?  Somehow I get the feeling that the success is getting to their already inflated heads and they might make an average second album.  The Stripes have 4 albums and 3 of them can be considered classics.  This band may not change music like Nirvana but boy do they kick more ass than they ever did.  The battle for best album of 2003 ended on April 1st.  Upcoming releases this year have alot to live up to compared to Elephant.  Radiohead or BRMC are gonna have to one up this performance, they might come close but I get the feeling they'll come up short.
B00007E8V4|5.0|OKAY, I'll try to make this as short as I can. I know there is a few other bands out there that preach about war, but this one ROCKS!!!I'm totally agains't war. I think that it is stupid ... but that's besides the point right?!?! Anywayz I think that Serj is the best and that I think they gave us alot of inspiration over the war. SO KEEP DOING IT S.O.A.D!!!!!!!I love you!!!!And you can add a few more \\"explicit\\" things we all love them anyways!!
B000006OAM|5.0|&quot;Ophelia&quot; is truly one of the most beatiful albums I've ever listened to. Comprised mostly of slow and often times sad ballads, &quot;Ophelia&quot; will touch your heart. The song &quot;My Skin&quot; is my album favorite, for its rich vocals and piano backing and sad, beautiful tune. While there are more upbeat songs like &quot;Life is Sweet&quot;, &quot;Break your Heart&quot;, and &quot;Kind and Generous&quot;, Natalie again and again returns to her sad side, with songs like &quot;effigy&quot; and &quot;the Living&quot;, where she laments, &quot;and i don't care to stay with the living...&quot; The piano is simply a beautiful instrument and when backed by drums and strings, the overall sound is truly heart wrenching. This album is definately not for people who want fast, dancable, up beat music. Instead it is for people who are soul-searching, people who are lost, people who have been hurt, or just anyone capable of feeling any emotion at all. this is the album.
B000084T18|4.0|What can we say about 50? Well for one thing-TAKE HIM OFF THE RADIO! Every day I hear \\"Wanksta\\" or \\"In Da Club\\" on my way to school and I just hate those songs now. 50 is a good emcee, but I don't beleive he's all that people are painting him to be. In fact there are many better emcees out there (several from NY actually-CAGE CAGE CAGE!). His \\"debut\\" album is good but far from what I would call a classic. It starts out on a strong note with \\"What Up Gangsta\\" which is my personal favorite. He jumps around on the next few songs speaking on different topics-drugs, money, fame, women. My favorite thing about this album though-the disses 50 slangs at Ja Rule, finally someone who hates him as much as I do! \\"Wanksta\\", \\"Back Down\\", and \\"Life's On The Line\\" are all aimed at the Pop-Rap star. \\"Life's\\" has a great hook and features 50 actually rapping not mumbling through a track (who knew!). All in all-this is a strong \\"debut\\" but the way I see it-with how quickly 50 blew up he's either going to be around for years, or in 6 months no one will care about him. <br />...
B00004Z459|5.0|I love it. Limp Bizkit couldn't come close to the poetry of Linkin Park. Highlights include &quot;Points of Authority&quot; and &quot;Papercut&quot;.
0671042858|5.0|This book was awesome to read. I first borrowed it from my friends' dad, when my friends told me it was a good book. I read it while listening to this one song and eating my fav. candies and taking the sun on the balcony. When I was finished, I thought it was a great book!<br />I don't know what made it so great, maybe the fact that Trisha was only 9 years old and not an adult, which means she was very young to know anything about being lost, especially in the woods. I know my dad would have said it's a boring book, since he don't like Stephen King's books, but I don't think it was really boring, it was more like interesting because it had all the little details which gave you the feeling that you were in the woods with her and watch her journey.<br />It was also good in a way, because this would really happen for real, so it wasn't just fiction, but a story which would happen to anyone at all as young as Trisha and also older, so it basically told you not to go into the woods by yourself without a good map and compass! Can someone please tell me everything she ate in the woods? What are the names of the berries she ate and what other things she found for food? My book's  in Finnish, so I'd like to know the names in English!!! THANKS!<br />EVERYONE READ THE BOOK! It's great!
B00008H2LB|4.0|There were two main things that came to mind after listening to Meteora: Firstly, that the lyrics were better developed than the first cd, and secondly that it has a very similar, yet perhaps due to the better lyrics,a more mature sound than Hybrid Theory. The vocals are more intense overall, there is more screaming (and he has a good screaming voice, so this is not a bad thing), there are somewhat more electronic effects than the first cd, though many of them are pretty cool (see the string sample in Faint for instance). Some of the stronger tracks are &quot;Don't Stay&quot; (this song basically sums up their entire sound as a whole in one song), &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; which is somewhat of a departure, but very well done, and Figure.09. There is also another cool dj track as on the first cd. Personally, I think they should stay more to the electronic and hard rock aspects, as more rap oriented songs such as &quot;Lying From You&quot; and &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; are some of the weaker tracks on the cd, though they arent a total loss. Overall a good, hard rocking, and more mature cd than Hybrid Theory; though it is short, an excellent record.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I own the VHS set of this that came out about 7 years ago. That was well over 8 hours of Beatles Anthology material on those tapes. Now, the DVD set will be available with an additional hour and a half of unreleased bonus materials, 5.1 DTS sound, better picture, etc...<br />For those who own the VHS, the DVD is worth picking up because of the special features listed above. Plus, they have everything in 5 discs as opposed to the bulky 8 tape VHS set. For those who only watched the 3 part TV Anthology series, remember that this set has an additional 3-4 hours of material not seen on television.<br />If anything get this set so you can hear the songs all over again in amazing 5.1 DTS surround sound. If you don't have a home theater system, it's time to get one for this great DVD set. Don't wait to read other reviews to pick up this DVD set. This is a no-brainer. Get it on April 1. As the bombs fell over England in 1940, John Winston Lennon was born and as war raged, Sir James Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Richard Starkey a.k.a. Ringo Starr began their young lives in a dirty port city called Liverpool. They were mostly poor boys who today are legends. <br />The most interesting thing from the TV special in 1995, the 3 albums that followed and the 8 VHS tapes that expanded the story was the fact that it was &quot;The Beatles&quot; in their own words and recollections. <br />There's so much packed inside this story and safe to say, so much more we don't know, that it is engrossing each time you watch it. The interweaving of outtakes, never before heard songs and footage is beautiful. George Martin's emotional talk and tears as he remembers John Lennon is heartwrenching. You see here the strength of the four lads from Liverpool, the closeness of their friendship and those involved with them.<br />The DVD version is jammed with more than the 8 VHS tapes and elevates the &quot;Anthology&quot; to a rounder story. At the time of its initial release, there were 3 surviving Beatles, sadly now there are 2. One sit through of this is not enough for you are sure to miss elements. As timeless as The Beatles themselves, so is their story and this anthology. <br />Robert Eldridge is a freelance writer for many publications and the author of: &quot;Amber Spirit: Poems &amp; Stories&quot; (Hats Off Books, 2001) and the dark poetic book, &quot;Offbeat&quot; (Writers Club Press, 2002.)
B00008H2LB|5.0|Yes, they're back. Even though the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; vibe is still present, &quot;Meteora&quot; brings a more in-depth look at the creativity Linkin Park is capable of. Two favorite tracks of mine are &quot;Faint&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;. These tracks are somewhat different from the former Linkin Park sound. But all the tracks are very very good. I totally recommend this CD if you liked &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I am an admittedly huge fan, but this is really an amazing CD.  If you liked the last one, you will like this one even more.  Knowing De Stijl and the first CD will make you like this one even more.  They prrogressed a lot between those last three, but this is a huge leap foward.  It is just really good music.  If you are sick of [bad] music in general, check this out to regain faith in the power of music.  I couldnt like it more (especially #12, The Air Around My fingers)
B000003D5F|5.0|While I adore this CD, and think that all bassists should listen to it at least once, it's decidedly not the CD for the rest of the jazz world -- it's all bass. But it's very good, and very acoustic. And if you like bass, you will love it. :)
0385484518|5.0|This book is great for people who want to konw about life.
0151006903|5.0|This is fantastic book full of interseting elements. Young Baudolino is a magic person. Time is magic too-middle age. I recommend it to everyone, especially for people who likes fantasy. It reminds me &quot;Narrenturm&quot; by polish fantasy master Sapkowski.
0786102780|5.0|This is the perfect novel. When was the first time you suspected that most middle-aged men in senior government positions had secret agendas? What were the circumstances that led you to believe that civil servants, ministers, and spies can prioritize morality to suit their career objectives? We have all suspected that there are troubling conflicts-of-interest in our western governments and the intelligence communities that serve them. This is the best primer on why spies are what spies do: Namely, they are servants to a sad version of democracy whose ends justify the means. Every page is littered with regrets, lost love, memories that haunt the living, double-crossings, spies, and manipulative statesmen more concerned with acheiving their goals than how western democracy may be tarnished by such actions. LeCarre is more than a just a writer; he is a kataskopic-sociologist (\\"kataskopic\\"= meaning spycraft) He mines the darkest hearts of every western democracy reminding us that spycraft in its most evil of forms is not worth parading in front of enslaved people.
B00005N5SF|5.0|I absolutely love this episode! Of course, this may have something to do with the fact that I'm a huge Spock fan, and love to see him act more human, which is rare. But there are also a lot of other great things about this episode. It's really fun, although you should probably watch it twice if you want to experience the fun in the silliness as much as possible, since you're worrying too much the first time about whether they'll ever get out! And, of course, the show itself took great strides with the showing of the first inter-racial kiss, between William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols, not to mention the one shared by Leonard Nimoy and Majel Barrett! But that's really what Star Trek is all about, isn't it? \\"To go where no one has gone before' and in this episode, they did that with a lot of fun involved.

B00008J4P5|4.0|This album is fantasic.  The really dirty dated way inwhich they recoreded it just addes to the huge, yet minimal sound.  This album is far better than White Blood Cells.  It's not near as popppy as the last.  However I'm still not sure it's as good De Stijl.  I do like the fact that they wen't back to a more bluesy approach on this one.  Elephant is very good, and will probably be one of the best records released this year over all musical genres.
B000002OX7|5.0|I'm a huge fan of The Who, and I must say that Who's Next is their greatest work. From the famous introduction to Baba O'Riley to the &quot;Yeaaaaaaah!&quot; screamed by Roger Daltrey in Won't Get Fooled Again, this CD is great. Pete Townshend's writing abilities truly show, and we get a small glimpse of John Entwistle's talent in &quot;My Wife.&quot; This is one of the greatest CDs ever, and it is truly a must have. In the words of Roger Daltrey (in the song bargain) &quot;I call it a bargain, the best I ever had.&quot;<BR>Oh yeah, Keith Moon is cool too (the drummer).
B00005RZV4|5.0|Finally Mr.Reznor gave his fans a live work from his &quot;Fragility 2.0&quot; tour,NIN's HALO seventeen. In my opinion this 16-tracks album is one of the best works I've ever had. These are the reasons: throughout the album I can hear a perfection in all sounds that very rarely in live albums I find; Trent Reznor is able to put together some wonders completely different like the powerful &quot;Gave Up&quot;,and the melodic &quot;The Great Below&quot;, and the electric &quot;The Mark Has Been Made&quot; one after the other, leaving a sense of pleasure that nowadays is difficult to find. And another reason is the beauty of the Industrial music, which Mr.Reznor represents in the best way it exists. A masterpiece.

B00004S35Z|5.0|people argue that songs in the key of life, innervisions or talking book are stevie's greatest. they are all true. fulfillingness' first finale is stevie's first....... well exactly as he chose to title it.... the first album that fullfilled his induvidual and musical expression. it is the most pure introspective vision into his soul. i was 4 years old when i heard it in 1974 and it changed my life forever. a personal masterpiece. this album has become the benchmark by which i interpret music. in a current world of pop music that leaves your soul feeling empty ..... thank god for stevie
0553103547|5.0|If you're looking at this, you've probably heard something about this series, and I just wanted to say that all the hype is for real.  This is the BEST fantasy series to come along in decades.  You will be taken for an unforgetable ride when you open this book.  I'd say more, but there are already enough reviews to give you the idea.  If you like this brand of fantasy, you'll love all the books in A Song of Ice and Fire.
B00006LLNU|5.0|A lot of people are saying this is bad music, one person even said if Sigur Ros wanted to have female vocals they should have hired a female singer.  Some people have also complained about the lyrics, which in itself is wrong to do.  You have to listen to the music with and open mind.  The lyrics aren't meant to be lyrics, they are meant to act like another instrument.  This CD is great if you are in the mood to just chill out.  I don't care what other people say, Sigur Ros makes great music.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Hopefully so.<br />Robbie is a worldwide superstar, on the same level as Madonna, everywhere but here in the U.S.  Why?  Maybe his cheeky British persona doesn't translate well to U.S. audiences. I'm not sure, and I don't understand why because other British acts with less talent than Robbie have had major success on these shores.  It really makes no sense, but it might have had something to do with Capitol Records failure to market Robbie's U.S. releases. (Capitol did a horrible job with Duran Duran in the mid-to-late 90's- so it's not like they don't have some sort of track record with screwing up big acts careers!)<br />With \\"Escapology\\" Robbie has jumped the Capitol ship and has moved to Virgin Records. Hopefully they'll know what to do with him.  The first single is \\"Feel\\" and it is easily one of the catchiest and hit-worthy tunes of 2003.  There is actual songwriting going on here kids- that's something that is up for debate on most of what appears on today's hit parade.  There is no mistaking what Robbie is singing- each song tells a story.  This is an artist with something to say.  It may be a bit bittersweet at times, but it never turns out preachy.  He says exactly what is on his mind as is evidenced by the parental warning sticker that appears on the cover.  The language doesn't go over in a rap-styled, offensive, \\"hide your kids ears\\" sort of way at all.  Lyrically it's just very real, heartfelt, confessional, and at all times highly listenable.  <br />One of the interesting things about Robbie's music is that it really doesn't strike a chord as being overly British at all. In fact, \\"Escapology\\" is his most \\"American\\" sounding effort yet.  It doesn't sound like a calculated move to sell cd's either.  \\"Escapology\\" might not grab you with hook laden arrangements like anything from \\"The Ego Has Landed\\" or \\"Sing When You're Winning\\", but everything starts clicking after subsequent spins.  There aren't any obvious poppy songs here like \\"Millennium\\" or \\"Rock DJ\\".  This is a more serious side of Robbie. But don't worry, you can't help but feel that his tongue isn't far from his cheek.  <br />What you get here is 14 more Robbie Williams gems.  There's not a stinker in the bunch.    <br />You have to love any album where out of nowhere comes a reference to Sheena Easton!  (\\"Me And My Monkey\\")<br />I know it's only April, but this is my album of the year (so far).
B0000029GA|5.0|Although only 40 some minutes long,This album is the best (If you are looking for lyrical diamonds in the rough).All I can say is if you get this album,you will not be dissapointed,track 2,5,7,and 9 really stand out.But the whole album is the best (lyrically out of QBC)---If you are looking for &quot;gangsta&quot; from QBC (see Mobb Deep--The Infamous)
B00008H2LB|5.0|the only words that i can use to describe this album are absolutely amazing, there is not one bad song on this album, i found that i have no taken it out of my cd player since the moment i got it and i dont think ill be taking it out for quite some time, the people who said every song sounds the same must be deaf cause there are many different varieties of songs, but all sounds like the linkin park weve come to enjoy, this cd has probably the catchiest and most memorable chorus' i have heard in a really long time, plus i think this cd is heavier than the last one, and that is definately a good thing, so if you havent picked this up yet, you should, this cd does not disappoint in any way
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Just put it on and sing along.  I have always been a fan of Fleetwood Mac and this is a great collection.  Lots of favorites all together without having to change records, tapes or discs.  No long description of it's attributes are needed.  You don't have to be a musical expert to appreciate it.
B000084T18|5.0|Got a lot of good songs on it, but it is starting to be overplayed.  Has a cool DVD though.
6305265666|5.0|This movie is absolutely divine. It depicts an almost believable story of the \\"real\\" Cinderella. Its magic is not that of a fairy god mother but is the kind that happens when mortal humans act out of love and soulful generosity. The film has a plot that is very entertaining and characters that are fascinating. <br />Drew Barrymore, as always, is beautiful and real at the same time. She brings just the right balance of humanity and enchantment to the film. She creates a strong, courageous and lovable Cinderella that everyone wants to see triumphant over the constraints forced upon her by mid-evil European culture and some timelessly bad characters.<br />I have and will continue to watch this movie over and over.
B000059PR5|1.0|This deserves 5 stars still I want this on DVD. I hate VHS. When it is released on DVD with extras on how the effects were done and the Nightline special I will buy this.
B00008DDXC|3.0|Chamber of Secrets had many wonderful scenes to see, and found viewing it a pleasure. I think a lot of us who have read the books say that these movies aptly bring to life the world of Harry Potter, but the characterization leaves something to be desired. I understand that it is an incredible accomplishment creating on screen the scenes and people that Ms. Rowling has created in our minds but I miss the dialogue. I miss the interactions between Harry and his newfound friends (and his newfound enemies.) Really these are great movies for the fans to watch, but in no way are they a replacent for the absolute wonder that is J.K. Rowling's talented writing. <BR>  There is a certain sameness between this movie and it's predecessor, but that is also true of the first two books. I can't wait to see what a new director does with the third book which is, in my opinion, the best and also where the epic of Harry Potter turns in new directions.
B000002KK2|5.0|When I first heard 'Chuck E's in Love,' way back when, I knew RLJ was here to stay and for all of us that went along for the RLJ experience, know what an influence she would have on our lives. What a voice and what style. I've been on the journey through all her recordings and eagerly await the new release due out this year. This is the album that captured \\"it\\" for all RLJ fans. Each song can probably be remembered for different special reasons and I bet all of us fans can remember where we were on first hearing each of them. Who can go past 'Ckuck E' but there is a lot to go past it for. Like everybody else 'Company' stands out, but only just, from what are all truly great songs. The influence of the album stands true. If you listen to any of the live recordings by RLJ (and there are now thirteen - fourteen if you count the Wiltern Theatre DVD) just wait to hear the audience reaction when Rickie sings any of the songs from this album, we know them all and we all love 'em!! 'Last Chance Texaco' (my personal favourite) takes you on the ride of your life and I really love 'Saturday Afternoons in 1963.' I love RLJ and I love this album and I love each song for a different reason and I'd never be without Rickie or Rickie's music in my life.
6305622914|5.0|If all women can be beautiful, then all men can be sexy!  This truly hillarious movie shows an out-of-work group of men trying anything to make ends meet.  When their womenfolk all go off to see the touring Chippendales show, the ringleader of the guys decides that stripping might not be such a bad gig.  After all, all you have to do is dance a little and take off your clothes, right?  And they need the money, one guy hasn't told his wife that he's lost his job and she keeps spending money, another needs to pay back child support or forgo seeing his son, and still another just needs the shot of self-esteem to save his marriage.  They gather together a group of followers, book the club, and set about creating their act.  Well, with a little soul searching and some some dance lessons, this eclectic group of men (most of them not in the least bit handsome) show us that ALL men can be sexy in the right get up and stripping to the right music!
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is one of the best movies i have seen!! It was all very well done, and the actors are GREAT! Through the whole movie, my attention was kept with it, and i've seen it 5 times in the theaters! In my opinion, it was a lot better than Fellowship, which is a VERY good movie. I recommend this movie to everyone!!
B000000OQF|5.0|If only G'N'R coulda stayed this good!  I love the Illusion albums but they should have put the good songs on one CD and ditched the rest! Appetite has no bad songs, it's just good from beginning to end.  It sits in the tapedeck of my car and is the best driving music ever!  And while some of the Heavy Metal from the 80's doesn't seem as great as it did then, this album never fades.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored water is ear pollution. There is no lyrical depth in the music, in fact many of the songs contain lines that were 'borrowed' ... from the likes of Nine Inch Nails and the Eagles.  Fred durst lacks any vocal ability so he thrives on rapping and screaming like a mutilated cow.  The only element of Limp Bizkit that deserves any recognition is guitarist Wes Borland who contributes some remotely  heavy riffs that would be half way decent if you lost Fred Durst and the rest of the band.  How, might one ask, has limp bizkit become so big?  The way I see it is that all the simple-minded empty headed ... low lifes of the world need someone to look up to, and fred durst surely fits the mold.  If you buy this album you are disgracing yourself and wasting your money on a CD put together by a band of minimal intelligence and talent in which each song is basically a replica of the next(musically and lyrically).  It is quite possibly one of the worst albums ever to surface the earth, and  it brings a bad name to rock music in general.  If limp bizkit is the shape of new rock to come, then lets all put bullets in our heads now instead of waiting for more bands like limp bizkit to surface and feed us their filth and idiocy.
B00008J4P5|5.0|When BG's &quot;Chopper City&quot; came out, I thought, &quot;The rest of Western Culture should just pack its bags and go home. There's absolutely nothing else that can rival this singular episode of genius.&quot; Well, this album doesn't quite do it, but it sure comes close. If only The White Stipes would cover some Rick Derringer...then my life would be complete.
B000002UB3|5.0|Who am I to say that Pauls musicianship was more impeccable on Abbey Road than on Revolver?  Or John more revelatory on Rubber Soul than on The White Album?<BR>For me, though, I get that grabbed-by-the-gut-and-forceably-hauled-off-to-a-higher-plane feeling more in Abbey Road than just about any record I know.  Does every cut do it to me?  No.  But cmon  the highs are SO high!<BR>Come Together does what Day Tripper did before it  it establishes this slick traditional melodic pattern, only to utterly harmonically explode it at the release.  The chorus of each comes up, and I find myself sitting up straighter in my chair.<BR>Something is exquisite from front to back.  Theres an other-worldliness to the level of inspiration displayed by everyone involved here.  Pauls bass and harmony vocals are particularly amazing.  <BR>Oh, Darling is some of the most amazing primal scream therapy ever caught on vinyl.  Cathartic.<BR>Here Comes the Sun - Georges vocal is terrific, and the cut is an evocative masterpiece.  It is a piece about optimism at a time when the world was going up in flames, and you can feel the dang sun on your arms as you listen.  Remarkable.<BR>Because is just amazing  the sounds we humans can produce!  Im a choral singer, so I just sit, slack-jawed, listening to this.<BR>You Never Give Me Your Money  Oh, baby  the Harrison guitar work into the One Sweet Dream section ... The piece as a whole just builds and builds from the simple piano intro straight through to that release  masterful.<BR>Polythene Pam  again, another kicking intro into the piece, courtesy of George, and the transition into \\"Bathroom Window\\"  Oh, look out! indeed.<BR>The final suite is just grand  its big and gaudy and juicy and just when its threatening to get to be too much, Harrisons guitar starts to ring again, into the Oh yeah/All right section  and that McCartney bass right there with it, add the Ringo drum solo, cap it all with And in the end and, excuse me, I just have to shower up.<BR>The rest of the album is OK, fine, really good, great  whatever you want it to be.  But any ONE of the highlights of Abbey Road makes this an album worth owning.  And the sheer number of highlights, and the level of genius, makes it a seminal work in the recording industry.  <BR>And the question of whether this is the Best - over Rubber Soul or Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, the White Album, Hard Days Night I don't know.  Just pick your favorite, there isnt a dog in the bunch!  Most acts want the chance to record one album. The ones who do hope they get to do one really good one.  Here we are debating which of five or six, all over 30 years old, deserves to be called the greatest.  That's, what, a third to a half of the albums they actually recorded???  Not a bad average.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films. As a kid, I thought this movie was coolest ever. It was about regular kids in a regular neighborhood who have a chance meeting with a Extra-Terrestrial, &quot;E.T.&quot;, and become his friend.  To this day, I still love it... it still makes me teary-eyed!<br />I bought this DVD even though I had never seen the new version. The first thing I did was watch it. I must say the additions were jarring to me. First of all, E.T. hopping like a bunny rabbit to escape really bothered me (One of the funniest parts in the original was E.T.'s heart light zooming through the grass! You knew he was terrifed)!  Secondly, E.T.'s digitally enhanced faced was freaky/scary! There was actually  too much animation in his face. Thirdly, those extra scene seemed watered down and unneccesary. I thought to myself &quot;No wonder they were cut out of the original&quot;. Especially the added Halloween scene with the bonfires... that seemed totally out of place in the film.<br />If I had a choice, I would still say the original is THE BEST version. But in all fairness, I've seen the original over 10 times and the remake only once.<br />I still am really happy with my Collector's Set. It is amazing to see how they were able to change the original. Also, the extras are really interesting... the reunion with the actors was an added bonus!  I recommend it!
B00003CXSP|4.0|We all know that the critics blasted \\"Hannibal\\" and it's so easy to see why- they went into the theatre expecting to see another \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". It's as simple as that. What the critics failed to see is an interesting movie about what Hannibal Lecter is like outside the asylum, with his freedom.<br />I was quite disappointed when Jodie Foster didn't reprise her role as Clarice Starling, but Julianne Moore's performance as the ten year after Clarice Starling is just as good, in my opinion. We are talking about a different Clarice Starling, much different from the one we saw and loved in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\".  In \\"Hannibal\\", she has realized that the FBI's value systems are beginning to get messed up and with her value systems intact, she doesn't know what direction to go to.  Julianne Moore just delivers such a great performance.  True, there isn't much that she can do with this character, but what she does is still excellent.  Check out the scene where she cries after the *spoiler* fishmarket disaster.  Check out her facial expression all throughout the final sequence, where they all have that demonic dinner at Paul Krendler's lake house. *end of spoiler*<br />Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Dr. Hannibal Lecter with a lot of wit, intelligence, and depth.  You see, \\"Hannibal\\" is not supposed to be a horror film.  It's simply a film that shows what Hannibal Lecter is like outside bars.  And it's a very interesting portrayal.  We begin to understand the pathology of this character.  How he eats people, and he reasons that he is doing the public a service.<br />There is a lot of sexual chemistry going on between Hannibal and Clarice Starling.  If you've read the book, you know what happened there, which is probably why Jodie Foster declined to reprise the role.  <br />I loved Hans Zimmer's score on this film.  The editing is excellent, and so is the cinematography.  Hey, we're talking about several sequences that ocurred in Italy, and Italy is such a beautiful place to shoot.<br />I absolutely love \\"Hannibal\\".  I love all the Hannibal Lecter movies. But \\"Hannibal\\" was a great way to end it.  *spoiler* In the last scene, we se Dr. Lecter in an airplane full of Asian people in there.  This is a hint that he is on his way to either Japan or Thailand- judging it from his taste.<br />If you thought \\"Hannibal\\" was a disaster, just think about what I said. Rent the DVD again and try to see the film as a stand-alone film.  Then maybe you'll understand my points here.  And when you're convinced, buy the DVD from Amazon.com.<br />Bon Appetit!
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men was about the best book I have ever read. It's a story of George and Lenny, two men that have not much more than each other. It's a captivating book, but not one to read if you like exciting, happily ever after endings. John Steinbeck is not that kind of writer. Everything that happens in the book is foreshadowed, and by the end it has you saying, &quot;Oh, that's why he wrote whate he wrote in the beginning.&quot; It's a great book and a must read for high school students.
B00005JLKN|4.0|I have just finished watching &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and &quot;Hannibal&quot;, in the order that I mentioned. Then, I saw &quot;Red Dragon&quot; again, skipping all the DVD special features.<br />I first saw &quot;Red Dragon&quot; of course, at the theatre.  Nothing beats the silver screen.  I loved &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and you'd be surprised hearing this from me that I also loved &quot;Hannibal&quot;, but &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is a special film on its own.<br />First, the cinematography is downright simple, yet brilliant.  The Baltimore asylum where Dr. Lecter is held is identical to the one you see in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;.  <br />Second, the acting. Of course, no one else can portray the diabolical Hannibal Lecter, M.D., and Anthony Hopkins does not fail to give such a stellar perfromance.  Edward Norton- I'm trying not to be biased here because I'm such a huge Norton fan, but all I can say is that he play Will Graham with so much precision and clarity.  He's able to create that suspension of disbelief that is so essential in every film.  There are several scenes wherre he asks for Dr. Lecter's advice in the asylum.  Carefully watch the scenes where he has no lines, but only facial expressions...the ones where Dr. Lecter tries to dissect him mentally...it's very similar to the scene in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; where Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is being dissected by Lecter and she shows this emotion on her face that shows that she's about to get torn but refuses to give in.  Norton does a similar effect and it's acting at top notch.  In the final scenes, I also loved how Mary Louise Parker cried.  It came so naturally, one of those rare crying scenes where you just feel raw emotion in your body.  Very electrifying.<br />Third, the editing of this film is not as good as &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, but I thought the screenplay was good.  Ted Tally should've been at least nominated for an Oscar for this one.<br />The music score by Danny Elfman didn't appeal to me very much.  To me, a film requires a very good music score.  Something that stays in your mind even days after watching the film.  There's nothing to Danny Elfman's music here that stays with me.  Howard Shore did a great job at &quot;Silence&quot;, because up to now, I can still hear that music in my head and see the face of Clarice Starling.<br />The story plot is akin to the of &quot;Silence&quot;, except for the fact that the agent here is not a rookie.  The interesting thing about &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is we see how Dr. Lecter interacts with a male agent from the FBI, as opposed to how he interacts with the female rookie agent Clarice Starling.  It really gives more depth into the twisted mind of Dr. Lecter.  He kills and eats people, because he feels he is doing the public a service.  <br />By the time this review is posted, the film will no longer be playing at the theaters, but please, if you loved &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, go out and get the DVD of &quot;Red Dragon&quot;.  You won't regret it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I am not a big fan of anime. In fact when my husband said he wanted to see this movie I tried to get out of it. I'm sure glad he made me go. While the movie doesn't have the special effects or computer graphics like the newer disney movies out today, it's by far superior in story line and characters. It will make you laugh out loud, as well as make you think about the damage we are doing to our planet. It's a beautifully written story about a young girls quest to save her parents, and learn a few things about herself. I would recommend this to anyone, although it does have a few scary moments I think most children see far worse in any of the newer disney movies. I don't quite understand what a few people thought was so awful about this movie and kids seeing it. I think as long as you explain and understand yourself the meaning of what happens it's a wonderful story that teaches a very valuble lesson about morals. Wonderful! I can't wait to own it on dvd.
6305313687|5.0|Even though it was really hard for me to watch this film given its content, I have to say that \\"American History X\\" is definitely a film worth seeing. I understand that not all movies can be nice and comfortable, and this movie proves that.<br />Edward Norton was incredible in his role as a reformed Nazi skinhead. The array of emotions he projected before and after his reformation left me speechless. He's an actor in the truest sense of the word.<br />Yes, like I've said before, this movie is difficult to watch, but my advice is to look beyond the hatred, name-calling, and violence and discover the message the film.
B00007GZRB|5.0|Five great episodes on this DVD develope some of the existing story lines and explore new territory.<BR>Ep. 5, Need, is about chemical dependancy and overcoming a god-complex. <BR>Ep. 6, Thor's Chariot, is a great episode and further developement of the story of the alien race that protects Earth. One of the 2 episodes that make this disk worth buying.<BR>In Ep. 7, Message in a Bottle, the team brings home an \\"artifact\\" that decides to take over Earth. <BR>Ep. 8, Family, revisits the planet Chulak in order to save Teal'C's son. Unfortunately he doesn't want to be rescued, and endangers the team and the planet Earth. <BR>Ep. 9, Secrets, is a double plot episode that brings back  Daniel Jackson's wife as he attempts to save her from the Goa'uld that has taken her for a host. At the same time Carter & O'Neill are off in Washington to receive a medal for what they did in Ep. 1, The Serpent's Lair. While there O'Neill is confronted by a reporter who threatens to blow the cover on the Stargate program, and Carter is confronted by a dying father who wants her to quit what she's doing to pursue her dream of becoming an astronaut. Key points of this episode are the introduction of Jacob Carter who plays prominently in later episodes, and Daniel finally getting to see his wife again. This episode is THE reason to buy this disk. <br />I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants some good basic episodes for viewing, or for those who want to revisit the history behind some of the current season's stories.
B000050FEN|4.0|Disturbing and scary don't seem like good enough words to describe the film, \\"Seven\\". This movie is a psychological thriller in which a serial killer kills his victims by using the seven deadly sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth. Of course you're disturbed by the killings and dark, damp feel of the movie, but you also learn about the message that the killer was ultimately trying to relay - although he didn't have to kill to get his point across.<br />Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman did great jobs playing the lead characters, and Kevin Spacey is chilling as the killer. This is definitely a movie you want to watch with a friend and with the lights on!
B00007GZRA|5.0|Another great set of episodes from the 2nd season. The Serpent's Lair is of course the 2nd part to first season's cliff hanger finale. You'll love this episode even if you didn't see the first half of it. They also do a terrific job of filling you in on the previous episode so you don't feel lost.<BR>In the Line of Duty is the introduction of the Tok'ra and specifically Jolinar who is mentioned repeatedly throughout the duration of the series. The episode itself it kind of thin, but it introduces and lays a foundation for later story lines. <BR>Prisoners is more intense &amp; will keep you guessing until the end. The crew is stranded on a prison planet because of crimes they unknowingly committed. They manage to rescue themselves by befriending another convict who was also seemingly misconvicted. Exciting end and lots of potential for future plots.<BR>The Gamekeeper episode is rather shallow &amp; not up to usual Stargate standards. Once again I felt like I was watching a take off on an old Star Trek episode. Still a couple of good episodes and one outstanding one make this DVD well worth the money!
B00003W8NM|3.0|Watching the film, &quot;Fight Club&quot; you are taken into the dark underworld of fighting for respect and honor. Overall, the movie is pretty good. The acting by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt is great (not to mention Brad Pitt's physique), and the movie really pulls you in to lives of the characters. The fight scenes are rather grisly, which will probably leave people turning away and wincing or peeking through their fingers.<br />I don't want to give anything away, but the ending will leave you speechless. If I hadn't watched it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. For the ending alone, watch this movie!
B00006LLJ4|5.0|Other than the incomparable Schindler's List (which is my second favourite film of all-time) and perhaps the wonderful entertainment Raiders of the Lost Ark, I think that this is Steven Spielberg's greatest film. And that's saying something.<br />To be sure, it is the best film I have seen in 2002. As a movie lover, I love films that almost get me drunk on the pure excitement of watching it. This is such a film. I saw it in theaters and bought it on DVD because everytime I watch it, I can look at it through a new angle.<br />If you watch it simply to be dazzled by the vision of the future, it's a masterpiece. If you watch it to be enveloped in a Hitchcockian murder mystery, it's a masterpiece. And as a combination of the two, it forges it's own special genre...like Blade Runner meets North by Northwest.<br />Also, there is an element of strong social commentary about the direction that America (and other countries, to be fair) is heading in with its \\"protection\\" of national interests. We may still be alive, but will we be free? There is an undeniable horror to two images in the movie: the one in which the halo is about to be put on the man's head at the beginning of the film (the guy who was about to kill his wife) and the one in which Anderton sees himself committing a crime. How could you talk your way out of it? \\"But...I haven't done anything!\\". \\"Yes, but you will...\\"<br />There are so many memorable images and moments: I haven't even mentioned the first great chase sequence, the Spyder sequence (which was weird but confusing) or the oddly romantic \\"Moon River\\" chase sequence in the mall. These are all moments that transcend any genre and get at the heart of why we go to the movies in the first place.<br />The performances would seem to be irrelevant in a sci-fi movie, but it is typical of Spielberg that they are first-rate. Tom Cruise really made me care about his character, even the corny missing son bit seemed genuine rather than forced on to forge his character. And the supporting performances are unforgettable: Samantha Morton is brilliant as a chilling Pre-Cog, Colin Farrell as the oily Witwer, Max von Sydow as the seemingly paternal head of Pre-Crime. And the characters Anderton meets along the way: the always creepy Peter Stormare, Lois Smith and Tim Blake Nelson add color and humor to the story.<br />I think this is a great film...what more needs to be said? When I first saw the film, I thought it was a masterpiece, although I thought the ending was flawed. Now, even the ending works for me. It's still a little bit overexpository (the genius of the crime is better revealed slyly and subtly...but I guess Spielberg wanted to make sure the audience wasn't confused). However, the ending contains genuine drama and many different shots that would have made Hitchcock proud. So even though it's the worst part of the film, it's still not bad.<br />But yes, as I said, this is a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, it's too bad you missed it in theaters (it really is a great moviegoing experience) but get it on DVD or VHS. You won't be disappointed.
0786868694|4.0|Nigella Lawson has sacheted onto the culinary scene as more a less a phenomenon, a culinary goddess -- and rightly so. In contrast to the chefs and restauranteurs who tackle the hard-covered written word to attest to their prowess in the business, Lawson shares her peculiar inclination to gravitate toward the formerly domestic confines of the kitchen, much to the delight of her fans. <BR>Those who pooh-pooh Nigella Bites as merely a \\"Nigella Sampler\\" are right to certain a degree. The book is not as broad in scope as How to Eat or How to Be A Domestic Goddess. But part of its usefulness and charm is in its diminuitive standing in the Nigella anthology. <BR>What most people get out of the book is its habitudinal friendliness. Recipes and tidbits satiate a variety of moods that set in at the office or as you walk through the door. With a lack of energy and hunger pains, the last thing you'd want to do is heave out a hefty collection of albeit delicious recipes. The book is fairly slim, reader friendly with a gargantuan font, and it's approachable at 7 p.m. when you need to unwind and eat before the rest of your evening is whittled away. <BR>The themed chapters serve well for frequent cravings and emphasizing variety and (gasp) experimentation for the palette. The Temple Food chapter offers Lawson's favorite flavors of the still relatively undiscovered cuisine of Vietnam. Her penchant for the earthy lusty flavors of the Mediterranean also share the spotlight in fast variations on grandmotherly classics such as involtini, meatballs, and mozzarella in carozza. <BR>A personal highlight was brief foray into traditional English cooking, which Nigella shamelessly admits to nostalgically adoring even as a chic writer/editor. The two must try recipes -- Lawson's gratin of potatoes (prepared unconventionally and tasting heavenly) and the English fave, Sticky Toffee Pudding -- in a word, unbelievable.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Here it is - another trendy sounding NIN/metallica/Limp Bizkit/Korn/RATM [imitator] thst dominates 'pop' music nowadays.  Talentless, empty headed songs about pouting and hating life - blaming everybody else instead of looking at one's self in the mirror.  Hybrid Theory at least had some life to it but wore thin very quickly once a well musically rounded music fan could sort out all the [derivative] influences (and there were plenty).  Yelling, screaming, blah, blah etc.  I can't believe the record company spent tens of thousands of dollars to prevent this ... music from being leaked out too soon - well, I guess you gotta make an extra buck anyway you can.  5 years from now no one will remember this band or their dopey sounding noise.  Yet another in a long line of 4th generation derivative 'bands' that MTV help make famous and then forget about once another new trendy sound comes along.  Hey - remember Hanson and Silverchair?  Yeah, I didn't think so.  One more thing...THIS CD IS UNDER 40 MINUTES LONG - WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER 40 MINUTES THAT COULD HAVE FILLED OUT THE CD?  PS  I initally bought this cd from a person who was bringing it back to sell used at Wherehouse Records.  Since they would only give him three bucks for it I offered him 4 bucks instead - he took the money and ran.  I took it home, played it, disliked it immensely, broke it in half, spit on it, stomped on it and finally ran over it in my car.  That was the most fun I ever had for only 4 dollars.
0060005424|5.0|Lirael starts off differently than where Sabriel ended, so if you haven't read Sabriel I think you'll pretty much understand Lirael.  Throughout the entire book, there are two stories going, one about Lirael and one about Sameth.  Every few chapters Nix goes from Lirael's story to Sameth's, and almost everytime he ends the chapter on a cliffhanger and I wanted to know more!  It sounds confusing, but it's really not and he ties the two together very well.  <br />Overall, this book was just great.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I read and I never wanted to put it down!  It is definately as good or probably better than Sabriel, but that's just my opinion.  It may be too dark for younger readers, but I'd say 10-12+ are good ages to start reading Nix.  Parents may also want to preview the books first depending on the maturity of the child.  These are not like any other young adult books!  Read them all; they're good for you.
0684852756|2.0|Narrated in first person we only get to Know one character, that of the husband that is going to flee from home, but what he tells us of his wife seem completly stupid. After 7 years of union that's all he knows? No wonder he wants to live. Anyhow, what Kureishi tells us about this man is also insufficient, plane. Stands at one only level. There are no characters at all, just one unique sensibility that flaws over the book splitting  us. A waste of time.
0064471837|5.0|I was very hesitant when I first bought this book, thinking it was just some spin-off of all the other sci-fi books that have recently become popular, but much to my delight it wasn't!  I'm a big fan of Tolkein and Lewis, but Nix is in a totally different catagory and it's just cool.  Some parts are pretty dark for younger readers, but he writes so elequently and vividly that I was just addicted to it on the first page.  As soon as I knew I loved Sabriel, I ran out and bought Lirael and Abhorson, and I am elated with the finds!  Get this book because it is well worth it!
0385484518|5.0|Tuesday with Morrie is a great book. It has many lessons about life that have seem to be forgotten. Not only does Morrie share life lessons with Mitch, but he also shares intuition with the world when he is interviewed. We all have friends and family members that live life to fast and have lost track of the important things in life and now only focus on the materialistic part of life. This book will let them know that there is a lot more to live for and having the bigger house does not always mean you are the better person. All in all this is a great book and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I remember viewing most of the Anthology on ABC in 1996-97.  I didn't understand how much footage was eliminated from the ABC broadcast until I started viewing the DVD version of the series.  The DVD includes much, much more interviews from the four, especially George Harrison.  Much more detail regarding their early experiences on tour in Hamburg was included, and I havent even started on Disk 2 nor checked out the 81 minutes additional footage on the surplus Disk included.  This series was done with extreme care.  One can get a feel for just how unique the Beatles were and led on their own course.  Even today, I feel there is just no easy comparison to others regarding their song composition skill and writing just came so naturally for Paul and John during their competitions with each other.  I recommend it highly..<br />David Carlin
B00005QG9J|5.0|i am a big incubus fan.  the first song i heard from them was new skin.  this album is so very different from it.  with this album you can just put it on and completely mellow out.  incubus not only managed to make a good album with curse words, but also seemed to have mastered the softness of there strings, drums and volcals.  this album will always be recommended by me to anyone!
B00006RU5B|5.0|This has quickly become one of my all time favorite hard rock CDs. Each song represents a new opportunity for Chris Cornell to give a clinic on relentless, unmitigated intensity, sans the growling so often heard from modern hard rock vocalists. The song structure is relatively straightforward, but beautifully performed and brimming with emotion. The ballads are every bit as intense and enjoyable as the hard rockers. Sometimes the lead guitar work comes off as a bit cheesy, but every one of the 14 songs are keepers. My enjoyment of this CD has grown with each listen.<br />Trust me, if you like hard rock, this is money very well spent!
B00008J4P5|3.0|I bought it yesterday and I gave it three spins and while it has that same great guitar and rock style I just don't feel this album is as enjoyable as previous White Strip offerings.<br />While the production and music might be tighter, if find there are less memorable moments in the overall album as opposed to say their White Blood Cells offering.<br />Plus the third song (I believe) has the startings of the exact same riff as Dead Leaves and the Dirty ground. I could be wrong but it gives me a bad feeling when I see rehashing like this.<br />Overall not bad, but not all that great.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I'm totally immune to the White Stripes hype at this point, but when the first few singles from this trickled to radio a couple of months ago, it became clear that Meg and Jack really were on the right track after all. They aren't being overly or gratuitiously ambitious here, just expanding their sound in exciting directions which they are fully ready for. They happily wear their surprising influences on their sleeve, from Robert Johnson to Wings, and have made an album which is by turns dark and brooding as well as carefree and playful. It all adds up to their most accessible, beguiling and compelling release to date. If you liked them before, know that they haven't abandoned their core sound, but if you found their previous releases same-y or limited, this record is also something of a breakthrough in that department. Who knew? Hyperbole and quality sometimes can and do intersect, particularly in Detroit (keep an eye out for the excellent album from Stripes buddies The Electric Six later this year).
6303430570|4.0|Even though 'Clerks' will probably go down (amongst critics) as the best Kevin Smith film, I think there's much that can be brought up to argue that. Sure, the fact it was made for merely $27,000 and the fact that it's black & white make it impressive; seeing as how it became (is) so popular so effortlessly. But as attractive as it is for some people, it may not be as pleasing for others. I will say this from the start: Kevin Smith is my favorite director. And I think that's very true for many people; as his infamous character Silent Bob makes him more famous than directing probably ever will. I think there'll be a lot of \\"Kevin Smith fans\\" that won't appreciate his next movie, 'Jersey Girl' (out at the end of summer). Even though Kevin is my favorite director, he's not my favorite actor. He never talks; how can he be anyone's favorite actor? I think Silent Bob is so admired that it overshadows the fact that he's an inspired director. The simplicity of 'Clerks' makes this movie more than brilliant, in its entirety, but does not make it perfect (in the list of View Askew and/or Kevin Smith movies).<br />The characters of Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) are probably the best character duo to appear in any movie. They are so incredibly different, yet they have almost too much in common for them to like each other. Bothersome or even everyday customers are something that anyone who's worked behind a counter can relate to. The way that Randal deals with those customers is particularly enjoyable; yet no one in their right mind would ever do the things he does (though we can still relate). Dante's troubles are brought out by Randal as the two contrast more and more as the movie goes on. The idea that the film's stupid or a funny-to-watch-when-you're-high-type movie is an ill-advised way to view it. The character's habits bring near perfection to the screen. However, the infamous roles of Jay and Silent Bob are rather weak. They're as funny as they come, but still a bit weak in comparison with the other parts. Now, when you watch movies like 'Dogma' or 'Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back', you can clearly see how Jason Mewes (and even Smith, himself) has matured as an actor. But nevertheless those infamous \\"dxck and fart jokes\\" still remain the same. The acting from the two girlfriends in the film (Marilyn Ghigliotti and Lisa Spoonauer) takes the cake here. They tackle the late-teen stereotypes with ease. Whether that was intended or not, it works wonders here. They probably make the movie watchable for girls; as 'Clerks' seems to be aimed, mainly, at the male audience. As I've hinted to, the development of Smith and his \\"team\\" have really progressed with each of his six movies. That is the main reason I cite 'Clerks' as the weaker of the six. But for the type of movie this is: a slacker/deadbeat generation comedy, there is nothing better. This is no question a must-see movie for anyone and everyone out there. And although not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did (and many, many others), you can proudly say you watched it.<br />On my listmania list for my top 100 movies ever, 'Clerks' sits nonchalantly at around #37; yet it moves up every time I rewrite the list (Mallrats is #1; J&SBSB is #6; Dogma is #8; Amy is #22). Some people might say that too much money can ruin someone. But in Kevin Smith's case, it only makes him better. There has been a constant increase in his films with the acting, directing, and design. Do not let my review lead you to believe this movie is bad. It's not at all. And it's only weak in the universe of View Askew; overall it's noteworthingly intelligent. I give it a strong 4.25 stars, deservingly, as it is better than just a plain 4-star rank. People who give this five stars and just say something to the effect of 'it's the coolest movie because Jay and Silent Bob are hilarious' aren't really aware of what makes a true movie. If you like movies with promise and originality, then 'Clerks' will become an instant favorite of yours. And if you are a Kevin Smith \\"fan\\" and haven't seen this movie, you're not really a fan. This is where it all started; at a little convenience store in New Jersey (as the Star Wars epoch may cite: the saga begins here). This movie is not perfect; though it's not far from it. And if you haven't seen it at least once, you're missing out on a turning point for film; and a great look into the youthful mind of Kevin Smith.ll become an instant favorite of yours.

B00005JLSC|1.0|Who chose the lead roles. I was very excited to see this movie and how it looked on the big screen,I loved the play.<br />What a disappointment. The leads cannot sing. there voices are flat and not appleaing at all. Madonna & Goldie Hawn in the roles would have been more appealing.<br />Dont waste your money with this
0790739909|3.0|There's no question that 1998's `City Of Angels' is a very diverse movie.  It has great acting (some by an actor who comes off roles in `8mm' and `Snake Eyes'), love, demise, angels, and even a great soundtrack.  This movie resides nicely in my extensive movie collection, even though most of the others are comedies, dramas, or action movies.  Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors; which is why I bought this in the first place.  And I'm glad I did.  Cage's performance is actually one of his best, and Meg Ryan is also at her finest.  This is certainly not one of the best films I've ever seen (and it's not one of my personal favorites), but it is still pleasing and [at least] worth your time.<br />A lot of other reviewers have gone into great depth in explaining the plot.  Therefore I won't do the same; I'll just give a brief overview of it.  The movie's plot is based on the characters of Seth (Cage) and Maggie (Ryan).  Seth is an angel who is sent to \\"pick up\\" the people he's to take to heaven.  And when he is waiting for a patient of Maggie (she's a doctor) to pass, he finds himself fascinated with her relentlessness in not giving up on the child.  Seth almost feels violated; as Maggie looks him in the eye and (seemingly) tells Seth not to take him yet.  The way the two interact when they're supposed to not even notice each other is outstanding.  Even though Seth knows that he's dead, he sometimes feels as if he can intermingle with her.  This part of the movie is by far the best; and once the two actually are able to communicate (how I won't ruin for you; I wouldn't be able to explain it too well), everything that seemed to be amazing within the movie begins to fade.  The acting becomes more average and the story starts to slow down and not let you know where it's going.  There's not much more that can be said about the film or it's basis.  But as for the ending, it almost ruined the movie completely.  I won't spoil it for you; as you can decide for yourself whether or not it's fitting.  It came up too fast, I think.  And I will stick to my saying it was one of the weaker endings in the romance movie library.  I could've easily changed my ranking to 4 stars from three if they'd had a better ending.  But even if you know what actually happens or you hate poor endings in film, still watch the movie.  The beginning and (overall) acting by Nicolas Cage are certainly worth it.  But for the common Cage fan: stay away from this one.  If you are hoping for a repeat of any of his action sequences from his previous or latter movies, you will be extremely disappointed.  This is a love story, this is not an action movie.  Nonetheless, he does an excellent job with his role and almost outdoes himself.  Meg Ryan also rises to the occasion; for all you `Sleepless In Seattle' fanatics out there.<br />In the end, `City Of Angels' is, overall, a decent movie.  The cast list is pretty limited; as really only Cage and Ryan are given the chance to shine.  But Andre Braugher does a good job in the small supporting cast, and Cage's `Leaving Las Vegas' co-star Elisabeth Shue appears shortly as a pregnant woman.  Still, Cage and Ryan are all you need to enjoy this movie.  It was a very popular movie, but I do believe it's slightly overrated.  The ending was very ineffectual and may, in time, make you lose interest in the movie (meaning you won't want to watch it again).  But kudos to Nicolas Cage for trying something new with his distinct career.  Definitely watch this movie if you haven't already.

B00005JKZT|2.0|I respect opinions. I got 'em, you all got 'em. I did not care for this movie, many of you will care for it. That is fine and peachy. Opinions!<br />... It demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of what Tolkien was attempting to achieve with the LOTR trilogy. So far, the movies have been created with the same misunderstanding.<br />Tolkien wrote a myth-history of England because, through various historical circumstances, England lacked one. Admiring the Kalevala, Beowulf and other historical \\"sagas\\", Tolkien wrote the LOTR as a substitute for England's own myth-histories.<br />Key to building this history are three things 1) sense of place, 2) sense of character and 3) sense of time [continuity]. Tolkien went to painstaking lengths to ensure that all of these were achieved. His narrative is truly a marvel of character development, pacing, interleaving of storylines and time scales, and language. To Tolkien that last is the most important: Tolkien was a philologist, and believed that a culture was defined by its language and that words had emotional vibrations associated with them, whether you understood them or not. That is a subject for another review.<br />Book to movie translation aside for the moment, The Two Towers fails to communicate Tolkiens original intentions for all three of the above. The sense of place is gone: Jackson far too often dwells on close-ups, particularly in interiors. The beauty that Tolkien finds in many of his settings is all but gone in the movie; Meduseld is a dark, grimy stable robbed of any majesty. The majesty that is leeched from Tolkien's places is also leeched from his characters. The sense of character that Tolkien excels out is non-existent in these movies, with Legolas and Gandalf the only two characters still left with a portion of the grace Toklien gifted them (and for that I applaud the actors, not Jackson). Faramir is not Tolkien's Faramir, Treebeard bears no resemblance to Tolkien's Ent, and Theoden is practically detestable, a whiny and sniveling coward. Third, sense of time. The movie is a narrative mess. Granted, there is much to include, much to cut. The book is far too long to translate word for word onto the screen. But we still find hackneyed scenes written in: the Warg battle is a trite, narrative-flow killing mess. The whole romantic interlude flashback/flash forward is a heavy handed and interruptive attempt to set-up a plot line not at all essential to the story at hand (hint: Tolkien left it out, leaving it for the appendices). We never get the sense of time and distance that Tolkien pulls off so adeptly.<br />As for translating books to scripts to screen. To the defenders of the Two Towers: you are right, it is an extremely difficult undertaking. But I will say this again: there are certain things in the source material that MUST be preserved. That is why it is the source material, and that is why the name of the book is riding on the opening credits. Consideration must be payed to the source material, especially when it is a 50 year old book that has been studied from stem to stern and rightly considered the most influential book of the century. Consideration must be paid to the fact that Tolkien was an accomplished writer and perfectionist, and intended every single line and plot point to be exactly as he wrote it. The success of his books are evidence enough that he knew what he was doing. To honor the man, you must honor his material, and Jackson et. al. fail so completely, I would say it borders on mockery (albeit non-intentional). Perhaps they are unable to understand Tolkien, ..., perhaps too many cooks, etc etc etc. ... It could be strongly argued that the Two Towers is that movie: in name only does this movie allude to the Two Towers I know, and is an affront to Tolkien's (Tolkien's mind you, not mine) original vision.<br />If Tolkien were alive, I am quite certain that these movies would not have been made.ble, a whiny and sniveling coward.

B00008J4P5|5.0|I got this album the day it came out.  Wow, this band really progresses on each album!  I got in to this band way before The Great Media Huricane of 2002 when they exploded on MTV.  I'm glad to see that those appearances haven't destroyed their music.  Usually bands that become MTV darlings come out with more radio friendly, watered down garbage, but The Stripes seem to spit in the eye of that theory on &quot;Elephant.&quot;  Superb album with more of a rock sound than De Stijl had.  But the blues roots that made me fall in love with them are still there, most obvious on &quot;Ball And Biscuit.&quot;  &quot;You've Got Her In Your Pocket,&quot;  is a nice, soft and mellow tune in the vein of past songs like &quot;We're Going To Be Friends&quot; and &quot;I'm Bound To Pack It Up.&quot;  Oh yeah, that's not a bass on &quot;Seven Nation Army,&quot;  It's an octave guitar.
B00007L4OM|4.0|Luc Besson has written an action packed comic book of a movie with Wasabi.  Jean Reno plays a tough, violent cop but with a lonely heart and a past.  Years before, his Japanese girlfriend left him for no obvious reason.  Reno hasn't been able to love since.<br />Reno is put on suspension with the police after an especially violent episode, and he is 'encouraged' to return to Japan when he discovers his lost love has just died and left him her heir.  Suprise!  When Reno arrives in Japan, the action really takes off.  To tell you more would spoil the fun...<br />Wasabi takes off with a pulsing electronic beat from the opening scene and keeps moving at a fast pace.  Sure, there are plot holes...  sure, some things don't make sense.  So what?  This isn't a film you see to make you think.  Quite the opposite...  no thinking, just fast paced action with some light comedy mixed in for good measure, all in a sleek technocolor package.<br />Regarding the DVD, sound quality was excellent.  The video quality was also VERY good, with no contrast problems or compression errors, etc.  Bright colors and a sharp image.  Enjoy!!!
6300216039|5.0|I first saw this movie in 1969, and everytime I see it again, it still looks fresh and new.  Because the actors are the ages that Shakespeare intended them to be played as, it seem much more realistic.  The photography is just beautiful and the acting is very heartfelt and believable.  The tenderness between Whiting and Hussey is truly magical. I would recommend this movie to young adults who might have trouble following the story in book form.  I think that they could really relate to this.
0553579908|5.0|You have to read this book after the first one.  It makes a lot more sense that way. Trust me.  This book continues on the breakneck pace of the first.  Again expect to be suprised and again don't expect to put this book down.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I'm 20 years old and I've been living through the slow decay of what we know as Rock and Roll. With the exception of a few blips on the radar once in a while,  music of the 90's and the new millenium has been lacking in passion, creativity, and true lyrical skill.<BR>The White Stripes have this encyclopaedic knowledge of blues and folk music, with obvious influence from the punk scene, they're known to meld these influences together. As hard as it seems, they've continued to top themselves with each consecutive album. I bought Elephant on Sunday (my friend works for a record shop) and I haven't been able to turn my stereo off for the past four days. This album is just solid gold, there's no other way to put it.<BR>I don't have the time or the desire to give reviews to each individual song, so let me just say that you'd be doing yourself a huge favor giving this group a try if you haven't already. They represent what music was before MTV, and god-willing, what it will become again: Music for music's sake, beautiful, melodical, original, and passionate. Does this mean they're the next Beatles? No of course not...They're the White Stripes, get used to them...
B00008GKEG|3.0|I was glad to see Apple finally release the 1995 Beatles Anthology set on DVD recently. The whole collection is packaged neatly into a tidy five CD box set.<br />The picture could have been remastered a bit better however, the quality is grainy and not as sharp as I'd hoped. The sound quality is done fairly well, but I found it most irritating that whenever the program cuts to song, the volume literally doubles! Either you hear the spoken dialog in whispers, and hear the music at a comfortable level, or else you hear the spoken dialog, while having your eardrums blasted with intercuts of song! We love their music, don't get me wrong, but turn the freaking volume down guys!<br />I also feel that the Anthology in general spends FAR too much time focussing on the Beatles' earliest days. Most Beatles fans would have rather had more attention spent on the Beatles' latter years and material, when their artistic merit was at its peak. The scratchy, raw, early tracks should have been treated as &quot;bonus material&quot;, not the main course in my opinion. As it is, two of the five disks in the set, [the first two], I'll most likely not watch very much.<br />What would have been nice is an extra CD of every Beatles &quot;video&quot; (they called them &quot;promo-clips&quot; in those days), in their entirety, uninterrupted. This would have included such &quot;videos&quot; as &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot;, &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, Paperback Writer&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot;, &quot;Revolution&quot;, and more...I think, as Beatles fans, we're all pretty sick of watching these legendary Beatles &quot;videos&quot; as badly digitized, low-res, downloaded MPGs - right fellow fans?<br />I can onlly give this set three stars. It could have been better. I expected more. It's still a must-have for all Beatles fans, but I wanted the ultimate and sadly, this isn't it.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie is probably one of the funniest movies of all time! It is great for kids and adults and people that don't like Sci-Fi! It is about the stars of an old TV show named \\"Galaxy Quest\\" and they are taken to a ship that is modeled exactly after the one they had in the show. My favorite character is Guy, everything that comes out of his mouth makes me crack up laughing! Buy or rent this movie, I'm sure you'll love it!
0140072187|5.0|An excellent private account of this mans experience in Vietnam. <BR>Not just for helicopter fans, for everybody. An inspiration if you think your having a hard time!! I have read it at four times over the past few years.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I first saw this film when it premiered on the FOX network. When I rented the theatrical version I saw they cut out Logan looking at his knuckles when he is thrown out of the bar, Rouge commenting on his trailer, Charles Xavier telling him that anonymity is a mutant's best friend and that he will help him find out what is going on, Jean Grey talking to Logan in his room followed by Scott tellling him to 'Stay away from my girl', Bobby 'Iceman' saying he dosen't know why Rogue didn't show up for lunch, Xavier asking Scott if he doesn't like Logan with Scott responding 'How did you guess?' and Prof. X saying 'I am telepathic, you know', Logan telling Scott that he wasn't the one who 'Put a sun roof in the train station', and later asking why they go out in the ridiculous outfits with Scott's response of 'Would you prefer yellow spandex?'. <br />When the movie had it's FX premiere last night at 8:00 p.m. eastern, these same scenes were gone but they added the originally deleted scene of Dr. Jean Grey putting on the mind read thingy. When I woke up later that night I turned on the TV to see what scene the midnight eastern showing was on and I saw that they had inserted the extended scene where Jean reads Logan's mind in the bedroom. Why couldn't they show that part when they aired it the first two times! They may have shown the complete version at midnight! At this rate you have to watch all the TV versions to see the entire movie!<br />On another note my father and I were disapointed that the first film wasn't exciting. Aa a matter of fact, when my dad saw the silent animatics for some of the action sequences he remarked, 'They should have made the whole movie this way'.<br />\\"X2\\" looks like it will be a good action film, and I hope to see it. My dad might even enjoy this one. <br />We know Patrick Stewart form watching 'Star Trek', Ian McKellen from 'The Lord of the Rings', Halle Berry from that Pepsi commercial and 'Die Another Day', and Hugh Jackman from his 180 role in 'Kate & Leopold'.<br />Maybe I should attend the new film as Scott Summers wearing his red visor. I'm sure they sell one at the local Toys R' Us.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Definitely the best thing I've heard in the last year. This record is almost flawless. I only really have one problem and i hate to admit it but the guitar in &quot;There's No Home For You Here&quot; sounds almost identical to that of &quot;Dead Leaves&quot; from White Blood Cells. But my god, Jack White brings us everything we've come to expect from the Stripes and then somehow builds on it with the addition of some blistering zeppelinesqe guitar with the addition of the solos that the Stripes seemed to be missing in the past. I would definitely recommend this to both the hardcore and the casual listeners of the band because its a really great mix of their gritty &quot;white boy blues&quot;(boy thats so overused) and the sincere and beautiful showcased on white blood cells and de stijl. I cant stress how impressed i am once again with the duo. Keep it up Guys.
B000088E6D|5.0|Finally a singer who brings the magic back. This youngster can sure sing and swing.<br /> David Foster has the touch and it shows throughout.   Very nice arrangements as to be expected from  David Foster.<br />A very worthwhile purchase for anyone (young or old) who likes to dance, or just likes good sounds.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Looking for some real Southern Blues? Go to Memphis. B.B. King, Patsy Kline, and Elvis are the real deal. Looking for a decent urban garage boyz-band? Check out The Strokes or The Libertines. Want a 'twee' pseudo-Blues-Gargage Band? Check out this cute sickly looking couple. The mood of this album reminds me of that movie, \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou. The movie portrayed Southerners as morons. The 'Stripes' seems to wants to pay homage to southern musical traditions, but actually they denigrate, bastardize, and exploit the Blues with an air of Yankee pretension. These Detroit kids have no business cooking up Fried Chicken and selling it on the national market. Fried Chicken and Blues is a Southern thang. Muddy Watters said this often quoted line, \\"The Whites can play the Blues but they can't sing the Blues.\\" Was he a prophet or something? It takes a more culturally sensitive and talented musician to actually pull it off. That's what makes Stevie Ray Vaughn, Lynyrd Skynryd, CCR, and Elvis great!!.  Another thing that annoys me about the Stripes is their ghostly, sickly complexion.  Why can't they be normal, no care in the world, natural rockers.  Another quip I have, are the Stripes still American?  They seem to hang out in London more than Detroit.  Every now and then they make a courtesy visit to Detroit, but then they spend the rest of their time in London.  Hell, even this album was recorded in England.  Perhaps, that would explain why this album is so bad, they have forgotten their Motor City rock n'roll roots.
B00006NSGX|3.0|One of the greatest artists of the century, Eric Clapton, finally droped his anticipated live album. The songs that he chose to perform on this set are very nice. This is full of Blues, R&amp;b, pop, soul, all mixed togather. This is nice with my music collection. I enjoyed this very much. I hope he makes an ultimate greatest hits collection. I'm cop that fa sho' if he does. There are some nice songs here that I would sample for making beats and spitting verses on. Hot. A must own.

B00007AJGH|5.0|Who Framed Roger Rabbit is nothing short of a masterpiece and way ahead of its time. At first glance, the film appears to be for the kiddies, but this is a somewhat complicated murder mystery with plenty of dark humor and hilarious jokes. The special effects and flawless blend of animation and live action--which are remarkable--never detract from the story and in the end they add a great dimension to this fine motion picture.<br />Simply put, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a landmark film. You could sit and marvel at the breathtaking special effects, and be fooled into thinking that they are the only reason it is any good. But even though the special effects are stunning, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a film experience like no other. It's a brilliant piece of work, utilising numerous elements to make it unforgettable. It blends comedy, film noir, romance, drama, horror, and any other style you can think of, into one roller coaster ride of a movie.<br />The film takes us back to 1947, into the hectic life of Hollywood. The only difference here is that Toons are living, breathing creations, that interact with humans. Toons live in Toon Town (obviously) but also come out to play in our world, and also to make a living in the glitzy world of showbiz. Roger Rabbit is a big star with Maroon Cartoons, but life isn't being very good to him lately. He can't seem to get a scene right, and no matter how many times he bangs his head, he just won't see stars. Studio owner R.K. Maroon is suspicious that Roger's wife, the seriously smouldering Jessica Rabbit, is being adulterous, so he enlists the help of private detective Eddie Valiant to catch her out. Eddie is a bitter, sullen man, and has a deep hatred for Toons ever since his brother and partner Teddy was killed by one (via a piano being dropped on his head). Still, Eddie takes the case, and catches Jessica playing \\"patty cake\\" with Marvin Acme, the head of the Acme Corporation, responsible for such things as hand buzzers and singing swords. When Roger finds out, he becomes hysterical, and vanishes into the night. The next morning, Acme is found dead, and Roger becomes the prime suspect in the case. On the run, Roger hooks up with Valiant, and swears that he was set up, an intriguing mystery in a truly wonderful film.<br />Who Framed Roger Rabbit never slips up in the quality department on any level. The performances are strong, the script switches from comedy to drama with ease, the direction is potent, and the special effects are amazing. Even after over a decade, they still look as fresh and real as ever. Bob Hoskins does a great job as Valiant; completely believable as a sour man out of his depth on a job he could do without. Christopher Lloyd is suitably terrifying as Judge Doom. His climactic scenes are ones that will stay with you long after the film has ended. Joanna Cassidy is under-used but effective as Dolores, giving a sexy and snappy performance. The vocal performances are also first rate; Charles Fleischer is perfect as maniacal Roger, and Kathleen Turner makes Jessica into one of the most sensual animated characters ever created. Robert Zemeckis does a great job directing the piece, and you can't review the film without mentioning the many cameos from popular cartoon stars. Highlights include Donald Duck and Daffy Duck in a war of piano skills, and Tweety Bird's rather callous treatment of Eddie as he clings to his life off the side of a skyscraper.<br />Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an essential film that everyone simply needs to see. Once seen, it will stay with you forever. A film deserving of the term \\"classic\\".ng swords. When Roger finds out, he becomes hysterical, and vanishes into the night.

B00000JZC4|5.0|Title of Record is a great album. When I bought it, I didn't know it would be as focused on industrial rock songs as it is, but that was a pleasant surprise. However, this isn't a rip-off of Nine Inch Nails like some people tend to believe. There is definently a similarity, but Filter shows a much more lighter side to industrial rock, throwing acoustic guitars and beautiful vocals into the mix from time to time. This is a very dimensional album. There is no one mood or feel for Title of Record. Some songs are heavy. Some songs aren't. Some songs are very industrial. Others have a more alternative rock feel to them. I definently recommend this album. Don't pass Filter up.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I think Elephant marks a new level of musical maturity for The White Stripes. The album uses the building blocks laid out on White Blood Cells by songs such as \\"The Same Boy You've Always Known\\", \\"Offend In Every Way\\", \\"Dead Leaves...\\" and \\"Now Mary\\". This album also showcases both Jack and Meg's abilities as virtuosos on their respective instruments. An example of this is \\"Ball And Biscuit\\" a song with a far out 1960's blues feel. Every time you listen to the album you find new things to like about it and you to notice the intricacy of the music. I wish I could say that I had a favorite song on the Album but they're all great. Three songs I'd like to point out are \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" an almost operatic piece, \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" penned by B. Bacharach, and \\"In The Cold, Cold Night\\" where you hear Meg sing in a sexy and beautiful voice. This is a really great Rock album and I highly recommend the purchase.
0805047905|5.0|This is obviously an all-time classic.  I read this book as a child, and now I am reading it to my own children.  We bought the Spanish version (sold on Amazon.com) as an introduction to a second language for our children.  The simple and straight forward text of this book lends itself wonderfully for this purpose.  It is called \\"Oso Pardo, Oso Pardo, Que Ves Ahi?\\"  It does a beautiful job of teaching animal names, colors, as well as some simple grammar in Spanish.  The colorful illustrations are wonderful reinforcements to promote learning with.  We could not be happier with our purchase!!
0345350499|5.0|This is a telling of the King Arthur saga that will forever change the way you look at the story.  It is told mostly from the point of view of Morgaine, half sister of Arthur, who is usually portrayed as the evil sorceress in other versions of the tale.  In this version, Morgaine is caught up in other people's plots but stil manages to have a life of her own.  <br />This is one of the few tellings of the saga where the Pagans are not the evil, but simply fighting to save their religion from the conquering Christians.  I also liked the fact that Merlin is \\"the Merlin\\", a title, rather than a single person.  <br />And the storytelling is absolutely magnificent.  Even as fan of Marion Zimmer Bradley, this stands out as her best work by far.  I loaned this book to a friend at work who came up to me and said, \\"I really hate you for loaning me that book.\\"  I asked why and she said, \\"Because I sit here at work and wonder what's happening to the characters.\\"  And yes, that is how captivating this book is.  <br />My only problem with the book is that it has ruined every other version of the story.  I can no longer watch \\"Merlin\\" or \\"Excalibur\\" or read \\"A Once and Future King.\\"  They feel like they are wrong.  This telling feels right.<br />I have loaned out at least a dozen copies of this book, and then have to buy another, because it doesn't get returned.  Buy it, own it, read it, read it again.

B000005KQT|5.0|I'm new to the blues and especially the harmonica, but I know one thing about this CD. Two words can described it \\"Bad ...!\\"  It is everything that I see the blues to be.  This is true blues!
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes 4th album, Elephant, is as good as, if not better than, all of their previous efforts.  The album is littered with Jack's trademark bluesy guitar work and Meg's simple drum beats, but a few tracks introduce a couple actual basslines for you low-end fanatics.<br />Lyrically the album is stellar.  The album is based on the \\"death of the sweetheart.\\"  The lyrics range from completely obscure to explicitly defined, leaving the listener intrigued with what they are actually trying to say.  <br />Without going into detail on each song, there are hardly any that aren't great.  Ball and Biscuit isn't one of my personal favorites, Jack's guitar rips it up but the song is lyrically drowning.  Outside of that there is nothing to dislike.  Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Doesn't quite live up to Hybrid Theory, but an excellent album.<br />&quot;Numb&quot; is an amazing song.
B000001FS3|5.0|I am definitely not a fan of U2, casual maybe, but not a diehard fan. To be perfectly honest, I find them somewhat overrated. Still the Irish band has put out some solid rock songs over the years, and most of the songs I enjoy are from their monumental \\"The Joshua Tree\\". In 1987, rock bands consisted of gobs of eyeliner and polluting the air with their incessant addiction to hairspray. Out of the cess pool of hair metal, stands an album that both rocked and actually possessed substance and that is U2's \\"The Joshua Tree\\". The album possesses the same lush sounds that Peter Gabriel's breakout hit \\"So\\" had and that is because of producer Daniel Lanois. The listener can here the same lushness on the ballads \\"With Or Without You\\" and \\"Running to Stand Still\\". What I draws me to this album is the spirituality in the lyrics. I liked the fact that the lyrics did not come off preachy as one would find with Christian rock bands. Plus the lyrics are easily to relate to for any listener who is trying to find his or her purpose in life. \\"The Joshua Tree\\" is a masterpiece. Unlike most rock bands in the '80s, U2 managed to outlast their peers with music that actually has depth and meaning. I may not be a fan of U2 but at least I can appreciate \\"The Joshua Tree\\" for its sheer beauty, lyrically and musically.
0345423496|5.0|Clarke's science is spot on, and his description of the 31st century is utterly fascinating. Most futuristic novels use some bit of technology as a 'centerpiece', not so here. The science itself is center, with no one piece taking over the show. Clarke's depiction of religion (which he calls \\"the madness of mankind\\") might offend some, but there is a lot of truth to it. The simple fact is that people REALLY HAVE offered up prayers to Osiris, Zeus, Epona, Ishtar, and Thor every bit as fervantly as they now offer them up to Jesus and Allah. People REALLY DO go on killing sprees for religious reasons, whether it be flying planes into buildings or blowing up abortion clinics, entire WARS are fought over religion (in fact a lot of people here in the states are on the religious rampage over the current war in Iraq, \\"God is with us\\" and all that). So, yes Clarke's denouncement of religion may offend some, but the truth does hurt.<br />Science and Religion out of the way...<br />As far as continuing the plot goes, Clarke does it in probably the last half of the book. It's quick compared to the others, but much of it is very cool. The ending is very open, and there is a plot hook on the last page that deals with the Monolith's final instructions. If we are lucky, Clarke might write 20001 (Though he's in his 80's so it doesn't look like it).<br />The only bad thing i found was the mid-book exit of a character named 'Dim.' He just vanishes and his fate is only mentioned in passing.<br />All in all, the best parts are the speculative ones. I can see how many didn't like it (but then anyone that thinks humans will be living in other solar systems or will have even traveled to any by the year 3001 needs his or her head checked, this is probably a lot like it will actually be though we may take a different road to get there), but if you are a science buff like myself there's few better works out there.
B00005JLT5|5.0|I have watched this movie only once so far but the images from the movie have really stuck with me.  Just when you think you've seen it all about The Holocaust, there's another, more horrible, story to shock and sicken people.<br /><br />Roman Polanski, who won the Oscar for Best Director, took Ron Harwood's adaptation of the late Wladyslaw Spzilman's book of the same name and delivered stunning visual testimony to a black period in human history, throwing in some of what he saw as a boy in the Krakow ghetto.<br /><br />There is no need to rehash the plot, as everyone is familiar with it.  Bottom line: Polanski and star Adrien Brody deserved their Oscars (and the movie should have received the Oscar for Best Picture).<br /><br />Read the book, watch the movie, and you'll learn to appreciate things a little more than before.

B00005JKZT|4.0|I'm not a purist (and yes, I love Peter Jackson's movies as much as anybody), but there are two MAJOR flaws in his adaptation of The Two Towers to the screen.  They are not trivial or nit-picky, in fact one of these errors ruins the logic of the entire story:<br />1. Jackson should NEVER have had Frodo \\"offer\\" the ring to a nazgul.  The entire point of the epic is that Sauron does NOT know the whereabouts of the ring, and does NOT know that it is in the possession of a hobbit nearing Mordor.  For Frodo to show the ring to a nazgul (effectively the eyes and ears of Sauron) is probably the single biggest blunder Jackson could have possibly made.  It boggles my mind that they put this scene in the film.  I can even understand the change to Faramir's character, but not this.<br />2. Why does Jackson have Pippin (probably the most foolish character in the epic) \\"trick\\" Treebeard (one of the oldest and wisest characters in the epic) into going to Isengaard?  Sorry, but the \\"purists\\" have a point when it comes to the change in Treebeard's character.  Why bother with the whole idea of the ent-meeting in the first place if the outcome is pointless?  And then there's the excruciating scene of Merry getting aggravated with Treebeard, as if he were an aggravated nurse trying to talk sense into a senile old man in an old folks' home.  <br />These changes have NOTHING to do with the necessities of altering a book to a film.  Simply omitting the \\"Frodo offers the ring to the nazgul\\" scene would not have harmed the film in any way, and there's nothing inherently film-friendly about the idea of transforming Treebeard into an old fool.  <br />Aside from these two major gripes, yes, I loved the movie, and forgave all the other changes to the story (thus the 4 stars).  Gollum is a miracle on screen.  The visuals are breath taking, and the acting is first rate.  Jackson really managed to capture an ATMOSPHERE in these films...which is what it is really all about in the end I guess.  ButI scratch my head at the thought of some of his plot decisions.
B000066C6Z|3.0|Earlier I wrote that this movie was hilarious, but after seeing it recently I discovered that it wasn't as funny as I used to think it was.  Maybe its because I remembered the funny lines and parts and repeated them tell they we're kind of played out, maybe I just have changed tastes with age. Whatever it is I didn't think this movie was superfunny. Don't get me wrong it still is kind of funny and fairly good. Just not as outstanding as I once thought.
B000001FFJ|5.0|If I would have to choose one album to take with me to a deserted island, this would be the one. I know it's a clishe, but it describes my affection to this album. 10 years, and it still get's better everytime I hear it.<br />It really splits opinions for Waits fans and for the 70's Waits fans this is not The Album, but I for one don't like the old stuff that much.<br />By the way, I'd sell a kidney to see Tom perform live, but even that's not enough when you live in Finland.
0792839749|4.0|This attempt by United Artists to craft its own version of Mary Poppins comes oh so close. The period setting (pre-WWI England), two young kids, Dick van Dyke, and super music by the Sherman Brothers make this seem like a Disney product. <br />However, the somewhat overlong film seems to lack the charm found in Poppins. This may be the result of adult elements subtly worked in, such as the wife-hating Baron and double entendres (\\"You'll find a slight squeeze on the ... an excellent safety precaution...\\"). The hook-wielding child catcher character is likely to be downright scary for small children.<br />On the plus side are terrific performances by the lead and supporting characters. You will keep humming the catchy tunes in your head for hours afterwards. The movie also has lots of visual goodies, including some beautiful automobiles.<br />The DVD is disappointing, since widescreen is not available. Despite the shortcomings, this film is worth having, at least on VHS.

B00003CXRP|5.0|This is one of my top ten favorite movies. Of interesting note is the fact that at first I didn't like it. I hated it for a time. When I walked out of the theater I was like &quot;What was in the package&quot; and &quot;That was weak&quot;. The first statement is a silly and unecessary question, the latter is just an outright lie, now. The one thing I took away from that first viewing was the unique plot device that was Wilson. My fascination with this came a while later. On a happenstance the MTV movie awards paired a clip with a snippet of Green Day's &quot;Castaway&quot;. Now mentioning Green Day won't get you instant acceptance in my book, but it will get you a second chance. So, I watched it again, and again, and again. A certain premium movie channel was very helpful in that respect. In brief, it is enough to say that I fell in love with it. The relationship with Wilson is simply brilliant. In addition, there is something real about this movie. Tom doesn't end up making a palace of reeds or getting back with Helen Hunt once he returns. No, he survives using his senses and items from the downed plane. This movie is a great lesson in overcoming functional fixedness! But another pivotal thing is the fact that he does not renew his relationship once he returns. Instead of idealizing the situation and having him have a fairy-tale reunion, he must deal with the very real fact that she has moved on. A thoroughly realistic storyline and a unique view into the human psyche under immense stress make this a truely original and moving movie.
B000008LOU|4.0|I agree with other reviewers that this Wilburys album was a step down from Vol. 1, mostly due to the absence of the legendary Roy Orbison, but it is still a great album, superior to much of the pop/rock material that was being released circa 1990.<BR>One of the pleasures of listening to the Wilburys is that they were so much fun - you could tell they were having fun writing and performing these songs. With Vol. 3 they were running on the momentum created by the immensely popular Vol. 1, and they crafted some fine songs here, but it obviously didn't have the sheer awe value of Vol. 1.<BR>Bob Dylan was actually my least favorite vocalist on Vol. 1 (I have since come to appreciate him more), but here they gave him prime chores, and I just remember being disappointed I wasn't hearing as much from Jeff Lynne and George Harrison. I especially thought Lynne would step into the gap left by Orbison to give us some soaring vocals, a la \\"Turn to Stone\\" from his ELO days. Even so, \\"New Blue Moon\\" became my favorite track on this album. I also enjoyed \\"Inside Out\\", \\"Where Were You Last Night\\", \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\" and \\"Poor House.\\"<BR>I highly recommend both this album and Vol. 1. I only wish they had continued to make music together and maybe even roped in another legend for the Wilburys, like Eric Clapton.
B000053VAF|5.0|Currently this is my favorite movie. Josie and the Pussycats and Chasing Amy are also in the running, but we'll see how that pans out. I'm weird. Can You Tell? Yet? Kevin does something remarkable here. He combines a religious message with comedy and doesn't end up being irreverant. He ends up with a movie that postulates the positive messages of Christianity while questioning the Dogma and keeping it all light and humorous. This is not an easy task. But Kevin does it deftly. Yes this movie has a poop monster, but thats actually a strength. Kevin didn't want to make a movie that hit people over the head with Christianity and screamed &quot;believe or else&quot; like others have done. Kevin instead intersperses the theology with comedy and makes you think. Kevin has made a movie that not only entertains but enlightens. What more could you want? Jason Lee, huh? Guess what, he's in here too. See I told you this movie has everything.
B00008DDXB|5.0|I was surprized when I saw this movie.I thought it was another family movie,kinda like the first movie,but this movie keep me interested and on the edge of my seat.This movie sure has alot more action than the first movie.This is a must have movie.
B000002MP2|5.0|I Knew I'd have to get around to writing this review at some point. I've been dreading it. I put it off to the last. I'm going to say my piece, and if someone doesn't like it, they can call me out on it. This is my least favorite Green Day album. Yes a Green Day obssessive who has built his entire life around them actually has the guts to say it, or the lack of good sense depending on how you look at it. First and foremost I do proudly profess that this album changed my life. This is possibly the single biggest influence on who I am today. In fact I'll go so far as to say that. This album is the foundation for my life. But, it just doesen't stand up to the other albums, even the pre-dookie albums. I'm sorry but for me this is the worst. A mind-blowing album, yes, but less mind-blowing than the rest. Don't misunderstand me, Dookie is better than any album by any other artist, it just doesn't stand up to Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning in particular. So I've said it, and now I'll leave. If you don't have this, get it. Its an excellent starting point for a newbie and a classic album even to some of the harshest critics. So don't think this is bad in anyway, shape, or form. Because, it is not. Its a perfect album
B00004TL21|5.0|I don't know why I chose now to write a review for WP as ive had the CD for a couple of years and now am anticipating their 4th release. <BR>Basically I read through what the rest of the world thought of this CD, generally its agreed that this is a 5 star CD then you have a small minority that say that Deftones have sold out because WP isn't as heavy as Adrenaline and ATF. Im gonna add my 2 cents worth and say that this CD is a classic. The Deftones have gone beyond the senseless, boring nu-metal that gets thrashed on radio because some people consider it accessible (e.g Creed, limp bizkit, etc). The Deftones produce songs simply better than that and I thinks its a good thing they dont get ripped up on radio. I agree that this is a different CD to the first two but if you are a true Deftones fan then u understand that chino, stef,abe,chi and frank have simply taken alternative music to another level, similar i think to what nirvana did. I would rather be a fan of a band that pushes themselves muscially rather than re-create the sound of an old CD, which I think is too easy and happens too much in the industry.<BR>Songs like Digital Bath, Change and Knife Party are heavy in their own way but have subtle touches that can make u listen to them over and over again.<BR>If for some reason u do not have this CD, buy it! But only if you are prepared for something amazingly different.
0446677450|4.0|This is a very enjoyable read.  I realize that most people will read it to learn how to become more financially independent, but it's also an entertaining memoir in its own right.  The author had a &quot;rich dad&quot; and a &quot;poor dad&quot;, the rich one being the father of his childhood buddy, and the poor one being his biological father.  The rich dad was a highly successful businessman who mentored the author about the road to gaining wealth, whereas the poor dad was an educational administrator who never gained wealth himself.  The author received conflicting advice from these two dads, and in the end he mainly chose to listen to his rich dad, and supposedly this ended up making him very wealthy.  While this book won't tell you everything you need to know about building wealth, it may be a good place to start.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.
B00005JKZT|4.0|\\"The Two Towers\\" is a direct sequel to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" without any prologue, flashback or \\"Previously on\\" footage. It opens up with an aerial view of the Misty Mountains (the same footage that was used when Gandalf fled from Orthanc on the giant eagle). This confused me at first. \\"What, they chose to go back into the mountains to look for Gandalf's hat\\"?<br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is nowhere near as good as \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and it is also very different from the book, but it's still a great movie. Peter Jackson wanted a trilogy, no actually one single movie broken into three, but a trilogy nonetheless (no one would be able to watch a movie that was 9 hours long). Peter also wanted each movie to be different from the others. So, \\"The Fellowship of the King\\" was a kind of introduction into everything. You got to see lots of people, races, monsters, locations and so on and so on. \\"The Two Towers\\" was the part where you got to see the Power of the ring, how it could turn people (Saruman) evil and what it was capable of bringing forth (the battle of Helms Deep). \\"The Two Towers\\" is also the movie of character development for all of the Fellowship members besides Frodo (he was the centre of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\") and Boromir (well, he's dead). Let's just hope that \\"The Return of the King\\" is better than both \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and \\"The Two Towers\\" and that it'll win the Oscar for \\"Best picture 2003\\".<br />Now, as for the changes in the movie. Some were for the better, others for the worse, at least for those who have read the books. Being someone who hasn't read the books, I can still say that \\"The Two Towers\\" is a great movie, in the sense of that it's a movie based loosely on a book.<br />Also, in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", the music made a big difference. For example, the drama of Gandalf's \\"death\\" combined with the last part of \\"The Bridge of Khazam-Dûm\\" made me cry... several times. However, in \\"The Two Towers\\", most of the songs, much like in \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret\\" are just variations and continuations of the songs of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\".<br />All in all, \\"The Two Towers\\" is a great movie that's worth seeing. I camped out in the Swedish winter cold for 3 days for tickets to the 00.01 premiere and I wasn't disappointed.
B00008GKEG|5.0|If you are like me, and missed the broadcasting of this series, and even if you didnt i highly recommened getting this set.  This DVD set has 2-3 hours of film not seen on TV, and a bonus 5th disk full of specail features.  I saw my friends VHS collection of the anthology and after watching the DVD's, i was amazed by better picture, better sound, and even the much rumored jam session of Paul, George, and Ringo.  I must say that altough this set is long , over 11 hours, its still quicker then reading the book(which i recommened), but if you want the songs with out alot of the talking, i recommened buying the cd sets.
B00008J4P5|2.0|First off, I am a White Stripes fan, I really like 'White Blood Cells' and I was very excited about 'Elephant'.  I have listened to this album many times and I really do feel it falls short.  Most of the songs are very derivative and un-original.  &quot;There's No Home For You Here&quot; sounds like a bad version of &quot;Dirty Leaves...&quot; &quot;Hypnotize&quot; sounds like an attempt for another &quot;Fell In Love With A Girl&quot; which isn't anywhere near as good.  A lot of the songwriting seems rather mediocre as well, the only thing that even saves this album is some of Jack's guitar playing which I do enjoy at times.  Even one of the best songs on the CD was written by someone else (Burt Bacharach).  Overall the album sounds quite un-focused, maybe I was expecting something new and exciting from them, and not the old sound just rehashed.  I do feel Jack White is a talented songwriter and has the capabilities, but I don't know why he fell short on this one.  Listening to it you can see how it could of been a GREAT album, but unfortunately for me it fell quite short.
0385484518|5.0|This book is the most phenomenal book I have ever read.  It made me realize how grateful I should be to be alive and to have a wonderful relationship with my family and friends.<BR>It really touched my heart just like Mitch touched Morrie's heart.  It is such a nice feeling to go back and pick up where you left off.<BR>I really recommend this book to anyone for some good laughs and cries.

B000002MTU|3.0|The first track is hot, but the rest of the album I can take or leave. Dig up some live Freddy King (like the Live at the Electric Ballroom album) if you want to hear what electric blues should sound like. This album is only a pale reflection.
B000088E6D|5.0|Thank you mr.buble for sharing your talent with us. for so many of us that just like songs where the words can be heard, and the big band sounds fills the room. <BR>This style of music should never be lost. You do 'come fly with me' as if you'd written it yourself, so nice to hear the fun in your voice. <BR>It's easy to see you really love this music, you can't hide that. I tried to compare you to others that I grew up with, but you are your own man , stay like that, you are good. Your future is brite, and I think you are cute!
0385504209|5.0|Once I got my hand on this book it wouldn't let me leave it alone.  I got through the 400 or so pages in a day.  It was that good and that exciting.  If you have an open mind that can handle exposure to some ideas on religion that might differ with what you have believed up to this point, give it a try!  The action will suck you in and have you talking about he book for days.
0060278250|4.0|Prince Sameth still bugs me, but this is a good book.  It starts right from where Lirael left off and covers only a short period of time.  I still want to know more!<br />Not a stand alone book, you need to have read Lirael to understand this one, and you should read Sabriel too.<br />Out of the three, Lirael is my favorite.  I love that library.
B00008MNYS|4.0|It is difficult for Americans to fathom just how big Robbie Williams is overseas. The only contemporary American to achieve this level of success at home is Eminem. And although they would seem to be oceans apart, there are similarities.<br />Both have won their countries biggest music awards. Both get widespread critical and commercial success in their homeland. And both are the subject of seemingly insatiable public appetite for details on their private life. Both have a strong creative partner - Dre for Eminem, Guy Chambers for Robbie.<br />But where everyone in the US under 30 has grown up in a hip-hop dominated country, the youth of the UK were raised on pop (Spice Girls)and rock (Oasis). Robbie neatly straddles the border between those two genres by contrasting often gorgeous melodies with biting lyrics. And serving it up with boundless energy and commanding stage presence.<br />Like Eminem, Robbie often uses his own life as the source of his material, and, also like Eminem, saves the sharpest barbs for himself. In Handsome Man, the verses sound like the biggest ego trip imaginable (\\"It's hard to be humble when you're so ******* big. Did you ever meet a sexier male chauvinist pig?\\") but the chorus reveals his insecurities and the transient nature of celebrity (\\"If you drop me I'll fall to pieces on ya. If you don't see me I don't exist\\").<br />Yes there are a few cuss words on the album - not nearly as many as on any single track by 50 Cent, but enough to deserve the Parental Advisory label.<br />Bizzarely, while he has clearly crafted this album with the American market in mind, some fool decided to exclude the most commercial track from the UK release that would seem to be an absolute natural for the US market: \\"Hot Fudge\\" - an uptempo number that would be right at home on any Elton John album of the early 70's.<br />This is an album for adults that don't \\"Feel\\" that good singing requires saccharine lyrics. Or that rock just has to leave you with a headache.<br />Come on, America! Give Robbie a chance. The Brits have supported you - now you can support a Brit.<br />Come on, America! Give Robbie a chance. The Brits have supported you - now you can support a Brit.
1400031346|4.0|Moments of brilliance mixed with a nice gentle story.  Quite a change from the average &quot;mystery&quot; or &quot;detective&quot; novel.<br />A good read, but don't expect a fast pace.
0345446798|5.0|If you have dogs, you need this book.  I was absolutely captivated by the author's explanation of how dogs interpret our movements, our words, our tones, our facial expressions, etc.  This book will truly help you understand your dog and become more aware of how you communicate with him.  This book is invaluable for anyone who wants to deepen her bond with her dog or for anyone who needs help training her dog.  This book has definitely affected me forever.
0783225482|5.0|1992: Robert Zemeckis' film is metafiction with great performances by the lead actresses Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn. The visual effects is what most attracts people to this film as it did back in 1992. The story is essentially dark comedy and satire, about the human weakness in women about vanity and rivalry, although commenting on men and women's desire to live forever, cheat death and remain young. Zemeckis lavished the film with stunning visual effects, haunting imagery and chilling music. Great performances by the lead actors. This film is worthy of Oscars, but I don't recall whether it won anything back in 1992.<br />Bruce Willis is the husband of Goldie Hawn, (Helen), Meryl Streep plays her rival, a faded stage actress. When the two women fight for him and to keep themselves young, they seek an enchantress (played by Isabella Rosallini) who gives them a potion that makes them young. However, they begin to rot and deteriorate until they are cartoon-like parodies of themselves, with plastic contortions of their bodies, huge eyes and holes in their stomachs. They die and even then they are caught up on lookin good. A great commentary on the plastic surgery and breast/image enhancement women of Hollywood are so pressured to do these days. This film is exceptional, with great music and with a lot of social commentary.
6302135621|3.0|I guess the high accolades for this film relate to it's innovation at the time it was released. To modern viewers, it strikes me as a good story about the rise and fall of a self-destructive genius. Yes, it's well acted and told along with being a good story, but I can't see this film as being anything more than an average good film.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium didn't seem to go down too well here in the UK, for some weird reason.  This movie is an absolute must for any fan of sci-fi/fantasy.  Although I originally only wanted to see it because it had Sean Bean in it (yeah, I'm a fan, so sue me :P) I found myself glued to my seat for the entire show and went back to see it over and over in every spare minute I had.  I'm eagerly awaiting it on DVD.<br />If you're reading my review, you'll probably go on to read or will already have read the ones giving you a rundown of the story, so I won't bore you with that here (besides, why watch it if you know what's going to happen :P) but suffice it to say that Equilibrium is a fast, gripping movie that'll have you on the edge of your seats and keep you guessing until the last minute.<br />There are one or two particularly nice parts; the fight in the Nether, the raid in Sector 7 and the shootout at the end in that big hallway (you'll understand when you watch it) but Equilibrium is probably the best movie I've seen in a long time.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Elephant is by far my favourite White Stripes album to date.  It's just more solid than White Blood Cells (another solid album).  It is darker, especially on songs you think would sound quite happy (as on their other albums).  I read somewhere that for the White Stripes, red and white differentiates between anger and innocence.  That is brilliantly displayed on this record.  Jack seems to be angry and furious at the world, but longs for his lost sweetheart, to which the album is dedicated.  Definitely the Stripes' best, in my opinion.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Wow. I'm still getting over this wonderful and breathtaking journey that is the Lion King.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie's music, story, and spiffy characters. I recommened it to anyone who likes movies period. Charcaters such as Timon & Pumba bring in comedic relief, while more serious and awesome characters such as Mufasa help bring depth and feel to the story. I dont care if your 2, 16, 28, 50, or even 90 years of age, you'll simply fall in love with this movie. If you ask me what the best part of the entire movie was, i would have to say the blending of the music and picture that is presented in such a way that is captavating and breathtaking. Buy the soundtrack now....also try the Broadway soundtrack. This is Disney at it's finest. This is one of the greatest animated pictures of all time if not one of the greatest movies ever.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue is OFF THE CHAIN.  This album was worth the wait.  This an an awesome dance album.  The tracks keep you shaking your ... all day long.  ...  This is the best DANCE album I have heard since CHER's BELIEVE.<br />I can't wait until her next album.  Keep up the good work KYLIE.
0380002930|3.0|Watership Down is a \\"cutesy\\" type of story.  Fairytale rabbits are for little children, not true readers.  If you are a parent or babysitter that is searching for a wonderful child's story, then Watership Down is definitely the book you should be looking for.  Children will love the talking rabbits and all the other animals.  Although, young children may not be able to understand some of the ideas presented in this book.  For example, the rabbits leave their warren in the beginning because of cruel humans.  But how could humans be so cruel?  The happy ending is always appreciated and should put your little children to bed easily after the scary, horrifying images presented through General Woundwort.  Again, this really is a children's story, so please don't try finding a way to enjoy it as an adult.
0380977788|5.0|\\"Coraline\\", while geared toward a young adult audience, has plenty of moments in which any human would recoil in fascinated horror!  \\"Coraline\\" finds Gaiman at his scary best, with a spooky premise and perfect execution of his plot.  I could easily see Tim Burton making a film from this clever little story.  If you like spooky stories, this one is highly recommended!
B00005JLSC|5.0|Chicago is certainly worth all the hype.  Renee Zellweiger was Ok in her role but Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah were fabulous.  However the movie is more than a super cast.<br />What intrigued me about Chicago were the many cpativating scenes.  Enjoyed the side by side cabaret performance vs the story line scenes at the courthouse, jail, and the hanging.  Marionette scene was creative as was the tap dancing role which fit Richard Gere's role well.  Stunning cinematography as well as the fabulous show music.<br />It gets my two thumbs up for sure.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Skimming through the reviews, I noticed that there are a lot of comparisons to the other albums by RATM.  While I guess this isn't a bad thing, I am not sure it this is the best way to rate an album for what it's worth.  A lot of multi-album artists give each album it's own feel, kinda its own style.  I think it's particiculary true of RATM, so I'm not going to rate this album on how it stacks up against the other.  I personally own and enjoy all of their albums and at different times, a different album is the one that spends the most time in my CD player.<br />Maybe I have more appreciation for this album then some might.  I have just recently become more serious with writing originals on the guitar so it's something I pay attention to more when listening to music.  I have always been a fan of 60s rock (Cream, Zepplin, Black Sabbath, Jimi, Doors, etc), but have recently found myself really enjoying those psycodelic inspired songs.  To me, Battle of Los Angeles is very reminicsent of Zepplin and Sabbath.  The base of the song is very simple, but strong at the same time.  You definitely FEEL the song.  I find that the repetivness of the melody is kinda of trance like.
B000001ZS4|5.0|For me, Jean Michel Jarre's works act as a stylistic bridge between the neo-symphonic and structured genius of Vangelis and the atmospheric psychedelia of late 70's, early 80's Tangerine Dream. While I firmly believe that Vangelis produces work of unparalleled majesty and depth that surpasses both Jarre and Tangerine Dream in a compositional sense, I find Jarre's \\"Equinoxe\\" to be a technically brilliant and ground-breaking synth album that remains musically relevant today despite its 25 years of age, which it wears with more grace than any electronic work released within at least 2 years of it.<br /> Jarre certainly proves with \\"Equinoxe\\" that he writes captivating and, as in the case of Equinoxe 5, infectious melodies. In addition, Jarre supplements these melodies with subtle and varied rhythmic/sequencer-esque foundations, lush synthesized strings, and the obviously synthesized sound techniques (all manner of shimmerings, glurps, arpeggiated interludes, and weather sounds) that he popularized with his previous release \\"Oxygene\\". Jarre's compositions are consistently engaging and stimulating, and effortlessly transport the mind of the listener to realms of imagination and timelessness. With \\"Equinoxe\\", Jean Michel Jarre has truly created a force to be reckoned with. <br />If you're interested in works of a similar nature, try Tangerine Dream's \\"Force Majeure\\" (perhaps my all time fav TD recording), or just about anything by Vangelis (although his pre-1980 releases will probably appeal more to those enchanted by the \\"Equinoxe\\" sound). Also try Mike Andrews (found on Ampcast), who writes outstanding Jarre/Vangelis inspired music.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is more of a classic than Dr. Dre's \\"Chronic\\". When Nas came on the rap scene in '94 he changed the game. \\"Illmatic\\" is a plain out masterpiece, with no special guest appearances Nas creates the best rap album of all time. Not to downplay any of the tracks, but the best tracks on this great album are \\"N.Y. State of Mind\\", \\"The World is Yours\\", and \\"One Love\\". Even though these are the best tracks on this album, any other track on the album would be the best in any other album. The greatest thing about this album is Nas keeps it real, unlike new artists ..., Nas speaks the real, so get this album, and tell your friends to get this album, this is a must have.
B000000OQF|4.0|Great album yes, but the best ever hard rock album is...... <br />Yes, Appetite is a fantastic hard rock album. An essential. ....<br /> There have been some truly excellent hard rock albums created over the years and GnR's AFD is definitely one of them. It also helped to begin the destruction of lime green, mall chick hair metal...(finished off by Nirvana and The Black Crowes in the early 90's) I'm thankful to Guns, Nirvana and the Crowes for that!! <BR>Appetite For Destruction has many great songs that emote the swagger of REAL hard rock. I do feel that Axel Rose limited Guns N Roses from reaching higher levels (namely of wit, humor and intelligence), because of his trashy, selfish attitude...lack of real depth. The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith are the original and best versions of what Guns N Roses was attempting to be. Still, I thank GnR for helping to kill off that painfully pussified hair metal crap...and I thank them for this great album. <br />\\"Mr. Brownstone\\", \\"It's So Easy\\" and especially \\"Rocket Queen\\" are great, underrated rock n roll songs. Marry them up with the \\"big\\" songs from this album and you've got a fantastic record. But, in my honest rock n roll blood opinion, there's no greater, more perfect hard rock album than AC/DC's BACK IN BLACK. And I say that as a huge BON SCOTT fan. AC/DC was best to me, with Bon Scott (see \\"wit\\", \\"humor\\" etc. above)...but you must admit, BACK IN BLACK is the monster of all MONSTERS, when it comes to great, heavy rock n roll albums. <br />**on a humorous note.... Is it just me or does Axel Rose sometimes sound like ETHYL MERMAN on acid? After a few GnR songs from later albums, he starts sounding like Ehtyl to me... \\"There's NO business, like SHOW business, like NO business I KNOWWWWWW\\" hahaha <br />Rock on...... Marc
6301236947|5.0|anyone who says this movie is pretentious,obviously has no understanding of the qualities that make U2 so unique.This is simply their musical peak captured on 100 minutes of video, capturing all the emotion and passion of a rock group trying to discover who they really are.In short,once you have heard these versions of their hit songs you will have a hard time going back to the original recordings.Electrifying.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of anime, in fact, the only ones I really enjoy are made by Studio Ghibli (the exception being Metropolis.)<BR>This is a classic anime film, winner of many awards, that I consider to be one of/if not Miyazaki's best film.   <br />It's not really a movie for children either.  It's rated PG for a reason, and while it is animated, many scenes are probably quite disturbing for children.  It isn't really advertised for children either, from what I've seen, it's just that it is animated, so parents are automatically going to assume they should take their children to it.  One must understand that in Japan, animation isn't considered just a children's art form.  It is highly respected by many adults and teenagers.  And there is a lot of Japanese culture depicted in this film that many Americans will not understand.  I didn't understand a lot of the things said in the film myself.  It's actually kind of sad, because I know a lot of parents are going to see this movie advertised, see that it is from Walt Disney Studios and when they take their children to see it, they will find that it is not typical animated fare, and will be very disappointed by it. But for adults who know what to expect, they will be amazed by the plot and animation of this movie.  I have several friends who are not fans of anime (and in fact some have spoken against it...), who saw this movie with me and really enjoyed it.  <br />Anyways, the dubbing in the movie is fantastic (and I have seen the Japanese version), the soundtrack is amazing.  The animation is stunning and the plot is very different, but great.  <br />There is a reason it has won so many awards, is so critically acclaimed, loved by many animators and the best selling movie of all time in Japan.  If you go in knowing what to expect, you will be amazed.  <br />Overall, it is a masterpiece of animation.  While I don't think all children will be scared by the film, a parent should definitely view the film first to decide whether it is appropriate or not for their kids.  It is a very different type of movie, with a deep and weird plot.  But if you go in expecting this, you will probably be like my friends and I, who were entranced by the young girl, Chihiro, adventures in the land of spirits.  <br />I will definitely be picking up the DVD for this one when it comes out in a few weeks.
B00005U122|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I was one of those who thought it was arrogant of Waters to try and unilaterally disband Pink Floyd. And I was (and still am) glad they went on without him. But I've got to say that after watching this DVD it becomes clear that Waters was the one with the creative vision for the band. This concert has a certain vitality that seems to be lacking in the glossier Thunder and Pulse videos. I even liked the concert's emphasis on the music rather than the light show. And the cuts from his post Floyd era come across surprisingly well. I say this as someone who never cared much for Roger Waters' solo efforts. However, in light of recent world events, his post Floyd songs seem especially relevant today. Of course it's always been apparent that Pink Floyd never had the same lyrical depth after Roger left the band. The contrast seems even greater in light of this video.<br />If Roger Waters was trying to make a point - Okay, I've got it. Point taken!
B000001FS3|5.0|Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but if you don't agree on this album's greatness, there is something you missed. I love to listen to this album as a whole. I know many will abuse tracks 1, 2, and 3, but if they have the courage to discover the rest, they'll hear the full &quot;Joshua&quot; package, and it's smoking!! One of my favourite tracks is &quot;Exit&quot;. It's so powerful. It's so easy to feel inspired. To me, this album is U2, but their first 2-3 albums are so strong too, but different. Rattle and Hum is in the same genre as Joshua Tree. I don't know how you could be disappointed with this album if you don't love it. You can't go wrong!!
B00003CXDB|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favourite Oliver Stone films. The hard-hitting dialogue snaps and pops with the same intensity as another nasty ode to the rotten core of the Big Apple, Sweet Smell of Success (Stone even cites it as an influence in the audio commentary).<br />Michael Douglas, in a career-defining roles nails Stone's excellent dialogue and delivers some of the best monologues ever put on film. He deserved the Best Actor Academy Award he won that year. His \\"greed is good\\" speech still gives me goosebumps.<br />After years of watching Wall Street on a faded, beat-up pan and scam VHS tape or on TV, it is so sweet to finally see it on DVD in it's proper aspect ratio. The transfer is top notch -- the film doesn't look a day old. However, the two highlights of this DVD are the fascinating documentary -- which features Douglas, Charlie Sheen, and Martin Sheen talking about their experiences working on Wall Street and how they feel about it today. Accompanying this documentary is an excellent audio commentary by Stone. As always, his comments are informative and candid -- he expresses regret that he cast Daryl Hannah in the role of Charlie Sheen's materialistic girlfriend and mentions that he should have swapped her role with Sean Young's.<br />It's scary how Stone's film mirrored corporate society back then (and they way it is now) and how it anticipates contemporary scandals like Enron. Great stuff!
B000002HH9|4.0|WHY do people automatically write of \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" on their 'cds to get list'? Really, I'd like to know.. Even the hard core fans bash it regularly.. Which puts me into shock. I do tend to prefer the darker songs and albums.. But that's beside the point.<BR>  This is the latest Cure cd I've purchased and I'm glad I did buy it. It isn't fair to just go reviews I know... But really, I don't see what's so bad about it. I've heard horrible names given to this under-rated album. I've heard a few people refer to it as containing a bunch of \\"throw away\\" songs, or \\"b-sides\\".. That's freakin' harsh, guys. But personally I've come to find over the years that on many occasions the \\"b-sides\\" are masterpieces.. Full of emotion and beautiful lyrics. It's totally unfair to judge something before you even listen to it, that's just common sense really. Everything in the world deserves at least a first try. <BR>   When I read the song listing for WMS, the songs jumped out at me and it had a special quality to their names. If you don't buy this album, your ears will be missing out. There are overlooked tracks like \\"Treasure\\",\\"Bare\\", and \\"Jupiter Crash\\"... 3 of the most amazing songs ever to be recorded. But however, if you are new to this wonderful band I have to agree with the others and recommend you to either \\"Pornography\\", \\"Disintegration\\" or \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\". All are great, but keep in mind that no album is a carbon copy from another... <br />  Being different is widely praised and it's looked at as a sign of beauty. It should be, and that really applies to music heavily no matter what style your into. And thank god too, if everything was the same the world would be so dull and boring!! So please don't skip on this one, you just might be crazy about it. Especially if you liked \\"The Top\\" or \\"Head on the Door\\". The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I really wished that there were more sentimental songs on it like \\"Treasure\\". But, it isn't a waste ofmoney, and besides that's not even humanly possible for a cd from this distinctive and creative band, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan. I know good music when I hear it, and talent as well. Enjoy!!
B00000J2SO|4.0|I think that the departure of Ronnie James Dio was the beginning of the end of Rainbow when they decided to be a AOR band like Journey and Boston rather than Deep Purple (Ritchie Blackmore and Roger Glover's former band) and Black Sabbath.<br />All Night Long is a fast paced rocker and intro sounds a little like the classic Man on the Silver Mountain and it is the best song off of this album. 5/5<BR>Eyes of the World is a dark tune resciment of the band's early days like the intro of Tarot Woman and Gates of Babylon and it is a killer track. 5/5<BR>No Time to Lose is a fast paced rocker but it's rather a forgettable pop/rock song with a little shade of blues. 3/5<BR>Makin' Love is a love song with a very good chorus if not anything else. 4/5<BR>Since You Been Gone is a Russ Ballard composition and he would later go onto fame in 1982 with a Top 10 hit You Can Do Magic by America and this song is a classic rock staple. 5/5<BR>Love's No Friend is the ballad off of this album. 5/5<BR>Danger Zone is a rather forgettable tune with background vocals. 3/5<BR>Lost in Hollywood has great drums but the song itself isn't that great. 3/5<BR>Sadly, this was the last album with singer Graham Bonnet who would later join MSG and Alcatrazz (with Yngwie Malmsteen who is influenced by Ritchie Blackmore) and the late great Cozy Powell who would later join Whitesnake, MSG and Black Sabbath and it's too bad that he's dead and if you love radio friendly hard rock music, then you must get this album and if you liked Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio, then be prepared for a dissapointment cause the music isn't like the way they were in the early days.
0790733226|2.0|I was so disappointed in this movie.  First of all were the stereotypes (illusion of dead father, typical currupt politician, boss who cares only for himself, truth about ETs is hidden).<br />Second, it's simply not developed.  It is 'wanna-be' deep.  It uses a lot of 'big' words to make the viewer think they are watching an intellectual movie when they are not.<br />Third, pacing.  The whole movie builds up to a 36 minute ending.  This includes the all important following of the ET's instructions.  By this point, I really didn't care.<br />Fourth, depth.  It tries to touch on many points that it never probes any of them in depth.  To see politics in the Space Program I recommend The Right Stuff (even though it is cleaned up version of the space program).  All the questions the aliens left Ellie with, that she never really probed them about.<br />The 'reunion' scene has been done better in Star Trek.<br />Pass this one up for a real thinker.  There are a lot of good Sci-Fi movies out there.

B00005JKQZ|3.0|This was a really enjoyable movie, but at some points lacking in depth.  I bought it hoping to get more out of it by multiple viewings as well as the extra material.  Boy was that a mistake.<br />The mathematics was never really explained, just shown to us by drawings.  I finally bought a copy of a book on the Game Theory in Politics to understand his groundbreaking work.<br />A great movie, it just does not have repeat quality like Gandhi or JFK.  Once you see it, you see it.  As a French minor, I may end up playing the French dubbed version simply to feel like I got my money's worth.  Never a good sign.<br />The stuff on the second disk was basically a waste of time to me.  I'm not interested in how they made a heavy drama like this.  Sure, in animation and action movies these can be interesting, but movies like this do not lend themselves to these featurettes.<br />Still, all in all great performances by all.  I recommend highly you see this movie, just don't buy it.
B000089A06|4.0|First things first:<br />As big a fan I am of Edward Norton, I think he was miscast as Graham.  Norton is a superb actor, but even the best actors often have onscreen traits they simply can't shed.  Tom Cruise can't go through a movie without being cocky, for instance, and Ed Norton is a just a little bit weasely.<br />That said, I liked Red Dragon far more than Manhunter, the original adaptation of Harris' book.  Keitel was as solid as ever as Crawford, Ralph Fiennes was exceptional as Dolarhyde, and Emily Watson was spot-on perfect as the potential redeemer.  Anthony Hopkins was back to menacing form ... no goofy &quot;Okey-dokey&quot;s here.  Brett Ratner's direction was at least a notch above adequate.  I also appreciated the fact that in several places lesser characters (e.g., Dr. Chilton and Barney) were played by the same actor as in the other two Lecter films.<br />Red Dragon doesn't have the same visual impact as Ridley Scott's Hannibal, but it comes much closer than Hannibal to matching the hawser taut suspense of Demme's Silence of the Lambs.

B00003CXCW|5.0|A superb transfer to dvd is just one of many reasons to buy this timeless, biting and brooding satire, which also gives us a tantalising and tasty glimpse of the LA of the late forties in some nice location shooting. Ace casting and performances make this film absolutely compelling, and what a blessing the original opening scene was dropped in favour of the now legendary 'body in the pool' opening.
B00008K78M|5.0|I have to say, without any doubt, this is such a great DVD!  I had the chance to go see her LIVE in Lima once month before she did this concert in Italy and she was so amazing, I was too impressed.  This LIVE CONCERT is just so fitting, to remember her on stage, brings back memories.  Laura is such a talented singer/artist and has such a great voice. This Best of... Live DVD of the concert in Milan has excellent sound and video quality. The cameras did a marvellous job in capturing every gesture of Laura and her musicians, nice and clear.  The best songs are in this concert, one word, AMAZING.  Really pumps you up with Non C'e and Il mio Sbaglio Piu Grande, plus the unforgettable ballad, Incancellabile, La Solitudine and Strani Amori. Plus her new songs, everything is in this DVD! For fans of Laura all over the world, it is a must have!  SO worth it!  Congratulations Laura, you have done it so well, once more. :-)

I havent stopped since.  Is it bad to listen to the same song over and over. i dont care.  i could just get lost in my rage and pain thinking of all we lose each and every day.  we may all be helpless in what happens in this world so accept it and let go of everything holding you back. peace
B00000DP01|5.0|Released in 1971 with Genesis taking up it's beloved classic line-up, Nursery Cryme is the album where Phil Collins first showcased his talent both on the drums and is also where Collins took lead vocals for the first time, not on Selling England By The Pound. The production of this CD is absolutely atrocious but the remastering does help Nursery Cryme a lot and sounds vastly superior to the older version. I must say that the album front cover sleeve with the striped field and the nurse playing tee ball, showcases the schizophrenic and psychotic mood of the LP. 1971 was one of the years of the golden era of prog-rock and Genesis were among the top bands of that style of rock and there's plenty of it on Nursery Cryme. Genesis in fact, never abandoned their prog-rock roots, even with their heavily polished, squeaky clean production of their 1983 self-titled debut and Invisible Touch as well as We Can't Dance and even Calling All Stations. There is no radio-friendly material on here but what there is is 7 tracks of sheer beauty with bizarre production with some of the strangest lyrics that Peter Gabriel has ever written. I might come into confrontations with those purists who can't seem to like any of the LPs Phil Collins at lead vocals, however, even I sometimes think about where Genesis would've gone if Steve Hackett had stayed but nonetheless, Genesis were among the most consistent bands of all time. Return of The Giant Hogweeds is a standout cut. I just love the buzzing guitar chord changes in the beginning of it and it&iexcl;¦s menacing musicianship and Gabriels fierce storytelling vocals and it truly showcases it&iexcl;¦s theme. It&iexcl;¦s an epic tale of giant plants that escapes from captivity to wreak terrible revenge on the human race and the guitars and organs are amazing! The other standout cut is For Absent Friends as it&iexcl;¦s where Phil Collins for the first time in his career, sings on lead vocals. While his voice was a bit mousey at that point, the song is a beautiful, simple, & acoustic ballad. The only thing that keeps this track from being great is that it&iexcl;¦s less than two minutes long! As much as this CD is great, I must honestly admit that the muddy production as well as it's short playing time of only 39 minutes does keep this from being an essential recording like Genesis latter material compared with Foxtrot or Selling England By The Pound. For the fan base whose tastes are mostly confined to the Phil Collins-era LPs, Nursery Cryme may not be an easy album to get into easily, even for those who loved Wind & Wuthering or Trick Of The Tail but even for those ppl, I do recommend trying NC for something different as Genesis are like a chameleon band. Despite all the cons, Nursery Cryme is a wonderful record that is one worthy of checking out even if it turns out not being all that appreciating. Sure it may not have gotten noticed at the time of it&iexcl;¦s release but guess what, it&iexcl;¦s still in print after 31 years! An enduring classic that is not quite an essential but definitely one worthy of checking out. Foxtrot and the two after it though have more edge to them than this one does and all of Genesis albums should be in your collection&iexcl;K..And I&iexcl;¦m not talking about just Peter Gabriel&iexcl;¦s LPs with them either&iexcl;K..Pick up the Turn It On Again: The Hits CD too! ºple, & acoustic ballad.

B00008IHN1|5.0|This movie was totally awesome! I am the co-captain of the Drumline at my high school and i would reccomend this movie to anyone! If any drummer could be as good as one of them they deserve to be bowed down too!
B00003CXDD|4.0|First off, this movie is excellent, you can see that from the 150 or so reviews.  What really bugs me about this movie is that the DVD version has some serious flaws with the transfer from the original film.  In the 'Escape from the Tavern' scene, there is a film scratch in the middle of the screen, from top to bottom, for about 30seconds.  Elsewhere in the film you will find bubbles, hairs, and more of the scratching.<br />It took more than ten years for this to come out of OOP, you think when it did they would have it perfect.  I find it funny how it says it has been digitially remastered for superior audio and visual quality.  If this is superior visual quality, I'd hate to see what the non-special edition version of this movie would look like.

B000089RVX|3.0|Checked a few samples of this band out and was pretty disappointed - but am not writing this to slag a band or its fans, just to maybe point some of you to some other stuff I think towers above this group - you just gotta go find it! If you like goth-tinged, melodic metal with engaging female vocals, look no further than groups like The Gathering, Lacuna Coil or Flowing Tears - all Euro but readily available in the States. Seriously, all their recent releases put this to shame. I guess it's something about their European roots that lends their music such great emotive impact and depth. This was just too boring and heard-it-all-before for me, especially after spending so much time listening to the other bands I just mentioned. CHECK 'EM OUT - YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!
B00005JLXC|4.0|Daredevil was a good action movie although I did expect more and for it to be better then Spiderman.  When we take one look at this movie, we wonder; Why is Spidey better?  After all this movie has a cooler hero, a more realistic story, a much hotter chick, but you want to know why Spiderman is better- BECAUSE SPIDERMAN HAD A PLOT AND THIS MOVIE DIDN'T.  All this movie was a 1hr full of memories and then 30 minutes of him battling bad guys and that is it.  Usually the bad guys would have some big plan for domination or just to mess with good guys mind but this movie didn't have any of that.  The only time Daredevil had a conflict with Kingpin was at the end.  And not only that, the hot chick Electra didn't get alot of action in this movie.  Anyway, here is what I can make of the plot.<BR>When Matt Murdock was a child he was accidently blinded when some chemicals hit eyes.  But after that incident: he managed to gain some super radar sense and was known to be fearless.  After taking advantage of this gift he was able to have less chances of getting hit by a car then a person who is not blind.  His father was a pro boxer who swore to make it the top after Matt was blinded and fought his way to beome champ.  But it seems that Matt's dad was expected to lose on purpose in his match against the champ but refused and was murdered by a mysterous man.  When Matt grew up he had become a lawyer but during night he had some other thing to do-become Daredevil.  Both Attorney Matt Murdock and Daredevil fight for one thing- justice.  If things do not go perfect in court, then Daredevil will make sure that things change.  That is how things go for matt and a reproter named Ben Urich tries to get the inside story on this daredevil and somehow finds out who daredevil is without reasonable explaination.  Then Matt's life may start to change when he meets a women, Elektra, and they boith grow to fall in love.  And then later, Kingpin wants to have electra killed and Daredevil just gets in his way.  That is pretty much it.  Sounds nuts.<BR>So that is pretty much of what I think the plot may be.  Overall this movie is OK and I would've given 3.5 stars if possible but I would'nt have given it 3 cuz that it too low.

B00004YZ36|5.0|Geza Anda has been one of my favorite pianists for a long time.  He has moved me deeply with his beautiful style, playing every composition as if he composed it himself, with power of expression and feeling. <br />This complete Mozart piano concertos box set is a beautiful collectors' edition, recorded from 1961 to 1969, with Deustche Grammophon's superb sound.<br />Geza Anda was born in Budapest in 1921, studied with Dohnanyi and Kodaly.  He won the Liszt Price in 1940.  A protege of Furtwaengler - who called him \\"le troubadour du piano,\\" he died of cancer in 1976.<br />He has received numerous awards with his earlier recordings of Liszt, Chopin, Brahms, and also with Mozart.  His friend Clara Haskil influenced his approach to Mozart. <BR>He was the first pianist who recorded all of Mozart's piano concertos, conducting from the keyboard, with the Camerata Academica des Salzburger Mozarteums.<br />From 1952 until his death, Anda made a solo appearance every year at the Salzburg Festival, a record matched by no other musician in Mozart's birthplace.

B000001GPW|5.0|Who else can perform Bartok piano concertos like Geza Anda and Ferenc Fricsay, with an electrifying Deutsche Grammophon sound?<br />I have only heard these piano concertos played by Yefim Bronfman/Salonen and Huseyin Sermet/Yoshinori Nishiwaki.  I was truly impressed when I heard this recording with Anda and Fricsay for the first time. <br />I would not want to hear any other recording after this one: it is incredible how much they enjoyed working together, those two Hungarian compatriots, how much they loved the composer. The result is the most thrilling and harmonious performance of these Bartok piano concertos.<br />I have never heard Anda play something so contemporary, with such passion and intensity.  I first fell in love with his live performances of Chopin's Etudes, and especially with his Schumann, even with the bad Testament sound recorded in the 50's.<br />Deustche Grammophon has issued a Centenary Collection 1966 with  Geza Anda performing the terrific &quot;Davidsbuendlertaenze, Op.6&quot; by Schumann in good studio sound. (Recently, Boris Berezovsky has recorded the same composition with Teldec, equally a fine performance, maybe even more romantic.)<br />I also enjoy Anda playing Grieg piano concerto with a gorgeous sound, conducted by Rafael Kubelik, Deutsche Grammophon's collection du millenaire - that I bought from France.
B000003TAR|5.0|I'm not here to dispute the popularity of this CD, \\"In Utero\\" by Nirvana, for it speaks for itself.  I am also not going to compare it to the even more popular and commercial CD, \\"Nevermind\\" for it is remarkable for any band to put out CD's of this calibur.  However, from the moment i heard In Utero, whew...it blew me away for a multitude of reasons.  First, never in my life have i been able to relate to a musician like i have Kurt Cobain, and no, i have not ever done heroin or contemplated suicide.  Cobain simply was a masterful songwriter who had the uncanny ability to reach out to each individual, no matter how depressing or morbid the lyrics.    I was mesmorized by the complexion of the lyrics and the tour that was given, leading into the head of Kurt Cobain.  If you have past biases based on his death, forget them, for like Kurt said, \\"Its about the music\\" and nothing else.  Rarely does a time come when a band can alter the way music is played forever on, but that time did come, in the form of Nirvana.   If you are sincerely reading these reviews when deciding whether to buy this CD or any Nirvana CD, I urge you to do so, because its about the music, and this simply cannot be beaten.

B00008GKEG|5.0|The Beatles Anthology originally aired on ABC in November, 1995.  The documentary was shown over the course of three days with the big hook being seeing the videos for the two \\"new\\" Beatles songs \\"Free As A Bird\\" &amp; \\"Real Love\\".  The series also set the stage for the release of three double-disk Anthology albums that would follow in subsequent months.  The documentary itself is a true gift for any Beatlemaniac.  It is loaded to the gills with performance footage, behind the scenes looks at their recording process, home movies and old interviews.  The best part though is all the living Beatles, at the time, participated in the production and gave current interviews and John Lennon was also liberally featured through archival interviews.  Seeing Paul McCartney, George Harrison &amp; Ringo Starr discuss their experiences in the band is a real treat and it's what separates this documentary from the countless others about the group out there.  Also, their producer and guide, George Martin provides candid insights that only someone who was so closely linked to the band could provide.  The new DVD collection does a tremendous job in providing a sharp picture and the 5.1 surround sound is amazing.  The additional footage on the final disk is superb, especially the three Beatles sitting together and reminiscing about old times and their return to Abbey Road Studios where, along with Mr. Martin, they provide some incite on the recording processes used on some their biggest hits.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is the masterpiece of an amazing collection of work by the White Stripes. They haven't succumbed to the pressure to become more mainstream after their hit album &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;, and this new album shows their diversity and willingness to try new things and go new directions with their music. I was shocked and unsure about my opinion on the matter when I heard the first note of the album: bass. But once I got into it, I saw that they utilize this highly overused frequency just as masterfully as Meg pounds her drums or Jack his guitar. Highlights include &quot;A Seven Nation Army&quot;, &quot;Ball and a Biscuit&quot;, and &quot;Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine&quot;. &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot; is a &quot;fever&quot;-esque trip into the cavernous reaches of 30's jazz, and it really adds some range to the listening experience overall. <BR>An interesting side note, the Stripes recorded this album with all vintage instruments, none dated post-'63.<BR>All in all, an amazing listening experience. The White Stripes have done it again.

0618164413|5.0|This is a review of _The Complete Adventures of Curious George_.<br />I know that I read (or had read to me) at least some of the Curious George books when I was in grade school. And I remember that I liked them. But that's almost all I remember. So, when we were given this book as a present for our two children, I didn't know what to expect.<br />I am now in awe of what a wonderful series of stories this is. There are seven stories, published over a series of twenty-five years. By modern publishing standards, that's not a lot of books for a successful series. There's a reason for that: Margaret and H.A. Rey took their time to craft fine stories.<br />These are stories that are written in a simple, comprehensible way, so my kids have been enjoying them since they were three years old. However, the stories are not \\"dumbed down\\" for children. The plots are interesting, with twists and turns. In \\"Curious George Gets a Medal,\\" George goes from thinking about writing letters, to trying to clean up some spilled ink, to trying to find a pump to clean up some water, to trying to find an animal to drag a pump, to a museum, where he meets the person who had written the letter that started him on his quest (!), to a rocket ride. This description cannot do justice to the natural flow the incidents have in the context of the story.<br />The illustrations are in a bright, charming, and in what is (now) an immediately recognizable style. Unlike so many children's books, it is obvious that great care has been put into the illustrations. In one picture, George is shown floating over the city, carried aloft by some balloons he had taken. He is the focus, of course, but if we look carefully, we see on the ground the balloon-man, from whom George had taken the balloons (running after George below), the brother and sister who were buying a balloon from him when George took the other balloons, the man with the yellow hat (driving in the same blue car with a tire on the back that will reappear on the next page), and a couple of men who have obviously walked into each other and fallen down because they were looking up in the air at George. Priceless!<br />The only entry in this collection that is not up to the general high standard is \\"Curious George Learns the Alphabet.\\" This is really not a story at all, but an introduction to the letters, showing how each resembles something that starts with that letter. It's fine for what it is, but it pales in comparison with the rich stories around it.<br />You can really appreciate how outstanding these stories are when you compare them to contemporary efforts to continue the series, like \\"Curious George and the Dumptruck\\" (published, thank goodness, separately). This story has none of the sparkle of the authentic, original Curious George.<br />In this era of political correctness, some parents, librarians and teachers may be concerned about certain aspects of some stories. George smokes a pipe before bed in one; in another he opens a bottle of ether, sniffs it, and goes into a woozy state before passing out. George also lives in a world in which there seem to be almost no people of color.<br />So supplement your children's reading of Curious George with other books that reflect the diversity of the world, and add your own little glosses to parts of the book that show behavior that concerns you (\\"Oh, George shouldn't open a medicine bottle should he? You wouldn't do that, would you?\\"). But do read to your children, and encourage them to read, Curious George.eappear on the next page), and a couple of men who have obviously walked into each other and fallen down because they were looking up in the air at George.

B00008972S|5.0|Wow.  What a great DVD.<br />The one hour documentary featuring interviews with some of the cast, Robert Wise, Harold Prince, Sondheim, and some key crew members is completely engrossing.  Home movie footage showing the filming of the movie is included.  Examples of the techniques that the movie makers used to film a musical are fascinating.  I was amazed that the knife scene, for example, is COMPLETELY counted out and the actor/dancers' movements were choreographed down to the second (breath, two, three, four; stab, two three; look, two, three, four).  Incredible!  Rita Morena is particularly informative regarding the dubbing of her song &quot;A Boy Like That&quot;.  The Robbins/Wise codirecting of the film is explained.  And some of Natalie Wood's original vocals are included.  The documentary is invaluable for fans of the film.<br />As for the film itself, it looks and sounds incredible on my widescreen HDTV.  The anamorphic transfer is very good.<br />The DVD is packaged very well.  The book which accompanies the set is very cool, with a great introduction by screenwriter Ernest Lehman (who is one of my movie heros).<br />I'm very impressed with this special edition of WEST SIDE STORY.  The film is a classic, and deserves such treatment.
B000002AGN|5.0|Simply a classic. This album is so complete, so clever, so subtle, so intense that few other words are required. Sure there are plenty of more technical albums, more complex albums, more challenging albums, more important albums, more obscure gems than Time out. But Time out proved that  when you have a strong idea, a strong concept, good musicians, and good interplay, the magic starts.  And moreover, why should we choose? Listen to all good jazz albums, and sure, this stands among them!  Unfortunatly this album falls in the category hated by idiot jazz fans. The category of popular successful albums. A lot of unaware jazz fans hate when their music leave the ghetto of jazz intellectualism to find popular appreciation.  Think of Wes Montgomery, George Benson, Miles Davis, Stan Getz. I'm not one of those superficial snob people who critizise successful jazz albums. Is the quality that counts. This album has the right to be called \\"one of the greatest jazz efforts in the whole history of jazz music\\". Black or white.  Popular or neglected.
B00008H2LE|5.0|I was kind of skeptical of this album.  I had heard a lot of good things and bad.  So I picked it up, and was pleased with the result. <br />Current Faves:<br />Don't Stay<BR>Easier to Run<BR>*From the Inside*<BR>Numb<BR>Breaking the Habit
B00005JL3A|3.0|I liked this movie it had very little gore tho but for a new horror movie it had lots. I know this was based on a video game but this could have worked has a prequel to night of the living dead if you think about it, cause the story in night for the living dead is radation has caused people to mutate in this one a virus has caused people to mutate this would work too as a prequel. Anyways about the movie i gave it three stars because there inst much gore involved but it is really fast paced and it never stops and you also have some neat monsters but again you see almost no one get ripped apart by these monsters. Give this a rent if you want to.
B00008D1NF|5.0|A lovely, subtle and profoundly life-affirming album... one of my favorites of the year!  The band's name and all-star cast are an apparent tribute to the Veloso-Gil-Bethania-Costa mid-1970s supergroup, Doce Barbaros (The Sweet Barbarians), but in this case the musicians, neo-tropicalistas Arnaldo Antunes, Carlinhos Brown and Marisa Monte, go for tender restraint, rather than wild excess.  It's a remarkably gentle, dreamy set, with an alluring blend of voices and styles.  Each of these musicians has been instrumental in deepening the stylistic vocabulary of modern Brazilian pop, and the three have worked together on various projects and albums over the years.  This album, however, is a marvel of collaborative creativity, with label owner Monte the album's guiding force and charismatic center, poet Antunes offering cerebral and ironic counterpoint, and soul-samba percussionist Brown mediating between the two, bringing his pure musicality in to balance them both.  The songs feature all three artists flowing effortlessly in overlapping parts, with an intuitive connection that is quite marvelous to hear.  (You can see it, too: if you can track down the DVD that accompanies this album, their creative process will astound you...)  Old-school &quot;axe&quot; star Margareth Menezes also guest on one song, the catchy and irresistible &quot;Passe Em Casa,&quot; one of many beautiful tunes that will echo in your mind for days on end.  All in all, this is a very beautiful, inventive and multi-textured record... HIGHLY recommended.
B000006045|5.0|This is Massive Attack's essential work.  It is the greatest midnight to early hour chill-out album ever created, an amazing blend of hip hop, rock, r&b, reggae, and soul seem to combine into one completely mind-blowing masterpiece.  The complexity, yet beauty, of these tracks allow you to re-discover the songs over and over again.<br />\\"Angel\\" sets the mood for the album, my favorite track on the CD if I had to pick one (appeared on the movie \\"Snatch,\\" which originally got me into Massive Attack). It's an incredible gem that puts you in a trance.  <br />Every song has an addictive beat and rhythm, and most noticeably in the hip-hop style tracks, such as \\"Inertia Creeps\\" and \\"Mezzanine,\\" both outstanding.  My favorite of this style is \\"Rising Son,\\" amazing vocals purified with a hypnotic beat.<br />Songs like \\"TearDrop\\" and \\"Dissolved Girl\\" allow the female vocalists of the group to shine, and they do a great job.  Theses tracks provide a \\"cool out\\" to the album which fits perfectly.  Other tracks which are very good are \\"Man Next Door,\\" a catchy reggae tune, and \\"Black Milk.\\"  The only couple tracks I didn't get into were the two \\"Exchanges.\\"  To me, they're the only two rather dull moments on this '98 release, but who knows? Maybe I just haven't gotten into them yet.<br />An interesting point. I only got into Massive Attack, and especially this album, in 2002.  I say this because I feel \\"Mezzanine\\" is the most timeless in their impressive collection.  I recommend all their CDs, \\"Protection\\" is really good and \\"Blue Lines\\" is a classic, but to me the music from it is stuck in the 90s.  This album will stand the test of time, pop it in 20 years from now and it will still be the essential late nite mix...
B000001GBJ|5.0|Wow, I'm not a big fan of slow music but this certainly is something else! It's very nice! Listen to the samples for yourself and decide...
B000089RVX|1.0|I got this cd ... and was totally blown away with the lyrics(they are played on a christian tv station)they are NOT what you think they are. they claim they are christians but they are not a christian band. im a christian and if i was in a band you can bet it would be a christian one. christians dont sing about \\"saving\\" themselves, its all about jesus/god. He is the only one who can save you
B0000067X1|5.0|A previous reviewer has drawn attention to the parallels between Radiohead and Can- that is a very appropriate comparison. &quot;Tago Mago&quot;, Can's second proper studio album, was the first to feature Japanese weirdo Damo Suzuki on vocals, and boy does he contribute something unique to the sound of the band. For those not familiar with Can, try to imagine a disco drummer, a bluesy noodling guitarist, a funky bassist, and a keyboardist with an ear for unusual bleeps and blurbs getting together and jamming under the influence of who-knows-what. Now imagine a Japanese guy who shrieks, whispers, mumbles, and bellows all sorts of indecipherable things over the top, acting more like another instrument than a lead vocalist. That would be Can, and this was their finest moment. The first song, &quot;Paperhouse&quot;, starts out mellow and sad, but builds to a wild rhythmic crescendo at the end. &quot;Mushroom&quot; is funky, and one can only speculate what the &quot;mushroom head&quot; is that Damo refers to throughout the entire song. &quot;Aumgn&quot; is an almost twenty minute long journey into the underworld, with all sorts of scary sounds, and &quot;Halleluwah&quot; is an equally long groovy number. If you have a tolerance for extremely long compositions, unorthodox song structures, 70's sound production, and a relentless rhythm section, then this is the CD for you. Also recommended are: Ege Bamyasi, Soon Over Babaluma, and Future Days.
B000002GVO|1.0|The Eagles were, once upon a time, a fairly acceptable, not too offensive country-rock band. They pedalled their palatable melodies to a reasonably appreciative audience, and all was well. Then they went and took a load of gak, turned into ego fuelled drug monsters, and produced appalling corporate soft-rock. Yes kids! They made Hotel California. <br />In a sane world they would have sold seven copies; been dropped by their label; taken up residence in cardboard box in a one horse town and spent the rest of their lives selling their blood, semen and wedding tackle in the hope of just one more line. In this world, however, the Eagles went from commercial strength to commercial strength, even as the relationships within the band fell apart; the record industry discovered that you could sell music to people who didn't like music, spawning everyone from Limp Bizkit to Shania Twain; cocaine and its derivatives became the soul salvation of choice for those rich enough, or desperate enough, to pay for it; and, in the end, we all lived unhappily ever after. <br />This is the worst album ever made, and THIS is what drugs will do to you.
B00008H2LB|1.0|this is another Band that Sounds so Formula Driven before they have had a chance to truly take some risks musically&this album is done really before it starts because between the vocals&raps mixed with the Musical Arrangements things are very much all the same.the best thing about this disc is that it doesn't last to long but that doesn't erase the Corperate Brass feel all over this Album.
0345350499|5.0|A great book for the Pagan and christian alike.  Explains,what i find a more belivable story of camalot.  A fight to keep the goddess alive as &quot;The Rise Of The Christians invade Briton&quot;.  A Great Athurian Legend Story, about the war between saxons and christians, the love of Lancelot and Gwyennefar, the jealousy and betrail of Morgause, and the bueaty of Avalon.
B00008GKEG|4.0|I never get tired of hearing about the Beatles&how they Grew Musically as Artists&wahtnot but I think this Set went a A few discs to long.I have another Beatles Disc Set on Dvd that details things in a lot shorter overview&very direct with it's presentation.nevertheless this is still a Must have for a Beatles fan because it covers alot of areas.they are one of the Greatest Musical Acts in Music History.
0380817683|3.0|\\"Rachel's Holiday\\" is similar in my opinion to \\"Hunger Point\\".  Both books use a humorous approach to very dark subject matters; drug abuse and eating disorders.  While enjoyed both books, I couldn't help but feel disturbed by the subject matter and the way the author told the story.  I understand the author's approach and I laughed myself to tears a few times, but I did not get a feel good feeling from reading this book.  It left me feeling oddly disturbed and I really can't put my finger on exactly why.  Or perhaps I'm just in \\"denial\\" of thoroughly enjoying this book.
B00008J4P5|2.0|I don't quite get all the Hype this Band gets.while it's cool they play there Instruments&wahtnot I don't find much Creative with the way they are hyped to me.the Arrangements are alright at best but the vocals just put me to sleep overall.they have parts here&there that I like but overall I don't feel they are worth all the hype the get.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I'm sure after reading the title, you're thinking, &quot;Forced?&quot;  It's been way over a year since I bought this cd, so my opinion HAS changed. I didn't really like this CD at first, but with more and more listens it became better in my mind. On to the review, this is an awesome album, no doubt, BUT even though this was released nearly two years after Make Yourself, the lyrics seem a little forced, but flow very well. The sound is great, Brandon's voice is cool, but the lyrics... They work until we start saying &quot;...Temporaryism is the Black Plague and the Jesus of our age...&quot;. C'mon... what is Temporaryism and how do you compare it to the Boubonic Plague and Jesus. I want to someone to explain this to me. I'm not even trying to be a smart-alec. I really want someone to explain this to me. Other than that, the album makes sense and is a step up from Make Yourself. Great job!
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is absolutely the final word on The Beatles, from those who know best, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, and George Martin.  Just about everything you could ever want from them is there.  Nothing is skimmed over.  From the days they were born, to when John and Paul first met, all the way to the break up.  The DVD even includes great \\"new\\" (at least it was when this was originally made) footage of Paul, George and Ringo together again.  And, if there is any part of this set you feel the need to skip over, it's much easier on disc.  If you are a die hard fan, you must own this set.  This isn't for the casual fan, though, because it is long.  But it is worth it.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a down are an amazing band that is very different to other bands. System of a down shows excellent musicianship, and should be going on for a long time. This album is system of a downs darkest album, and best in my opinion. This album should have been more well known then toxicity. Any way my personal favourite tracks are \\"suite pee\\", \\"p.l.u.c.k\\", \\"soil\\" and mind. The main reason why i like system of a down is because their so insane, and they have excellent lyrics, great musician ship and there is just no band you can compare them to. The singer in the band serj tankian is very talented and does many types of singing like fast talk, slow singing, singing and even chanting. Serj tankian also is the one who writes those fabulous lyrics, and its really cool how he changes his moods in songs without warning you, and guitarist daron malakian is excellent on his guitar and he is an excellent vocalist and does help ot with the lyrics to. Possibly my favourite vocalist, and he has such i nice voice, and drummer john dolmayan is excellent on those drums, especially in the intro of their classic metal song chopsuey, and he is so great, and last but no least bassist shavo odadjian, is an excellent bassist, who also for sure helped out in the hit song chopsuey. Any way system of a down are obviously one of my favourite bands, and i think its strange their in the nu metal catagory, because in an interview they said they don't like nu metal, and don't think they are but any way, they are one of the few non metal bands that metal fans like so metal fan or not, go get this album!!! THANK YOU FOR READING-PEACE
B0000640SA|5.0|Wow, this movie is good. I doubt you'll ever see anything else that's as intriging, confusing, and unique as this film. The plot is so completely different from any other film out there; essentially, you're watching the movie backwards, scene by scene (except for the opening where the footage is played completely backward, its awesome).<br />Be warned, because of the complexity of the plot, you have to really follow the film closely. In other words, you probably won't get much out of the film if you're watching it at a party or making-out or talking on the phone or whatever. You have to use a little bit of your brain to piece the movie together.<BR>I highly recommend this movie I can pretty much guarantee that this will definitely be a memorable viewing experience.<br />In regards to the normal DVD and the special edition one, get the special edition one -its loaded with cool goodies (not normal goodies, really unique goodies)

GREAT !<BR>The songs here will never sound dated.<br />This CD gets the honour of sitting next to <BR>Clash, London Calling,<BR>Van Morrison Moondance,<BR>Grateful Dead American Beauty<BR>My Bloody Valentine's Loveless<BR>Muddy Waters and<BR>Stevie Ray Vaughn.
0385484518|4.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is definitely one of the better books I have read.  Everything Morrie teaches in this true life story should be on everyone's heart after reading this book.  The lessons of life, love, compassion, forgiveness, and dying...along with many other topics...are all lessons that we can definitely learn from.  After reading this book, my mind has been opened to so many things that I was so oblivious to before.  I've always known that I should live life to the fullest and to take nothing for granted, but after reading this book, I finally realized WHY I should do this.  THAT to me is something far more valuable than material possessions or money on it's own, which is what Morrie was trying to teach everyone that he came across.  Live life for others and live life for yourself.  Take in every breath as if it is your last...take in every moment as if you will never experience it again...take in the life you live...embrace it.
B000088E6D|5.0|When a voice like this keeps these beautiful songs alive, Sinatra and all the others who have left us would be proud.  Michael does these songs a fantastic justice, and I for one want to thank him for honouring this music with such conviction.  He sings from his soul, as is how these songs need to be sung.  That is why he will be the next big star to shine.  Keep up the good work Michael...We love your c.d. and most important we love your voice.  An incredible legacy to this wonderful music and to those who sang them before you. Buy this album for many hours of enjoyable listening.
0812550706|5.0|By far, this is the most inspiring, beautiful, moving book I have ever read. A masterpiece.
B00005JLK1|5.0|Any movie that can make you slide to the edge of your seat and cover your eyes in the first 5 minutes is going to be a good one, guaranteed!  This movie is one of the best horror films that I have seen come out in a long time.  The special effects are top notch, the acting is incredible, and the plot is good.  I wanted to see this movie in the theatre, but just never got around to it.  I bought it the day it came out and watched it as soon as I got home.  I swear, I had to get up and turn the lights back on to watch it.  One of the best things about this movie is that everything comes full circle.  There are no loose ends just lying around.  On the predictabiliy scale, this movie doesn't even rank.   You never know what is lurking around the corner or sitting in the next cabin.  The sets in this movie are among the best and rank right in there with the sets from The Haunting and Titanic.  This is a movie I will definitely watch over and over and keep enjoying for a long time to come.
B00008H2LE|1.0|[As I write this, 188 reviews, with an average of 4 1/2 stars, have been written for Amazon.com for this album, which should have been titled \\"Mediocre.\\"<br />The minute I heard \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" on the radio, I knew this piece of [music] was going to be overwhelmingly, and unneccessarily, huge.  I got my dose of this album on release day, when a friend and I went to the store to see what was coming out.  He bought \\"Meteora,\\" and later, I bought some Tylenol to dull the pain I experienced after he played it for me.<br />For those of you out there who read my first review of the \\"Hybrid Theory\\" album, the title of both reviews doesn't lie.  Linkin Park will end up having the credits to the two most overrated albums in music history, all because elementary and junior high kids seem to adore their unoriginal, boring, uninventive, and lackluster musical phrases, as well as Chester's lyrics of his pain and suffering (cough).  (SIDENOTE: How can this man be in pain?  Would selling umpteen million copies of your music and have money out the wazoo make you sad???)<br />This album [isn't really good].  Their music is horribly unoriginal and boring, and the lyrics on both of their albums is a charade.  Don't waste your money on this drivel -- go buy something written by people with actually artistic credibility.
B0000399WI|5.0|When I first saw the Amazon page for Shawshank Redemption, I was amazed. How can a movie with over 300 reviews still get an average 5 star rating? Further more the Movie was Nominated for so many awards, that's its impossible not to be tempted into buying it. <br />Well I can honestly say that I was not disappointed. In my opinion, Shawshank Redemption is by far one of the best stories ever. <br />I recommend shawshank redemption to evreyone. It is a movie which you would rather own than rent. <br />It has all the elements of a good movie: Good acting. unexpecting yet feel-good ending. Amazing storyline. And the feeling of not knowing what to expect scene by scene.
B00008J4P5|3.0|If you're new to the White Stripes, back the trolley up and start with their first two albums for the most unadulterated Detroit Blues/Rock you can get from Jack and Meg White.  <br />While Elephant is a notable entry in their body of work, it certainly isn't the Whites at their peak form.  Gone is the sweet school-day lyricism found on De Stijl and White Blood Cells, drowned out by some forced guitar work (but definitely better drum work from Meg).  Don't get me wrong, I love this duo and I think they have more staying power than most, but after multiple listenings, I feel just a little let down.
B00008H2LE|4.0|I love hybrid and reanimation so i was expecting something great from LP...   This CD is good, but it's not the best.  It's not one of those cd's that i said &quot;WOW thats f#ck!n awesome..&quot; which really disappointed me. I thought LP would produce something new and different, but they didn't succed well.  Some of Meteora is great, but some just sounds to much like another remix of hybrid.
B00004TH83|5.0|This CD is absolutely phenomenal.  I first heard of Lara Fabian when I was in France and KNEW that she would popular in the US when I came home.  It was so disappointing to find out that no one knew about her even after the great dance anthem &quot;I Will Love Again.&quot;  Trying to understand why this album was not popular will drive you insane and will make you hate everyone who hasn't heard of her.  She's being compared to Celine and Whitney, but given the chance, Lara could sing circles around them both.  You can keep those &quot;divas&quot; for yourself, cause I've got a date with Lara Fabian tonight.
B00005JL9B|5.0|i downloaded Battel Royale, not noing much, after trying to download Ringu over a billion times, i could never get it, So i decided, battle Royale, and, dang, this movie was great. All<BR>starts out scary. then back to calm, then scary the whole times, with a mix of drama. This movie was everything i wanted to see, bloody, scary, cute ninth grade girls in skool uniforms (im 14, so yea, hah)<br />this movie is great, a must for everyone, even though causeing a lot of trouble in its home land, i cant wait till its released in america, but i feel it shouldnt be released now due to war, and terrorism, we can wait, u can download it, but, untill the DVD comes out, u wont get the full expierence, till then , buy the DVD, and expirence, BATTLE ROYALE!<br />:// Zell
B000001FI7|5.0|No matter what kind of music you like, there's something in Portishead you will enjoy. You can't really catogorize them in just one genre, they appeal to many genres and bring it all together on this album, like a melting pot. There's some abscure music here, backed with Beth Gibbons wonderful, mesmerizing vocals that will draw you in. There's a bit of trip hop, classical, R&amp;B, rock, and many other styles represented on this debut album from Portishead. Released in 1994, is still sounds fresh and new today, it hasn't aged at all. My favorites on the album include &quot;Mysterious&quot;, &quot;Sour Times&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot;, &quot;It's A Fire&quot;, &quot;Numb&quot; and &quot;Roads&quot;, although the whole tracklisting is superb with not one filler or unnessesary track included. Overall this is a modern classic, if you don't have it, it's time to add this timeless album to your collection.

B000002GDJ|5.0|While The Police's juggernaut, Outlandos d'Amour woke the world up to a fresh, new sound, it was their sophomore effort that proved they were the real deal.  Led by the radio hits \\"Message In A Bottle\\" and \\"Walking On The Moon,\\" Regatta De Blanc started the snowball that would culminate in 1983's Synchronicity.  Where Outlandos introduced the band, Regatta was the second date that made you believe this could be the one.<BR>The \\"White Reggae\\" kicks off in what each member of the band calls the quintessential Police song, \\"Message In A Bottle.\\"  It captures everything right about The Police. Stewart Copeland's manic, driving, syncopated beat; Andy Summers' arpeggio and flange chords and crying responses to the lyric; Sting's counter-melodic lead bass, simple-yet poetic words tied together with harmonized vocals.<BR>Throwing all the rules out the window, they follow up with the instrumental piece \\"Regatta De Blanc\\" (with an occasional Sting shout and trademark \\"Yo\\") The Grammy-award winning song resulted from live performances and was originally a musical bridge between songs.<BR>\\"It's Alright For You\\" is a driving rocker featuring the usual quick-and-soaring Summers solo and excellent guitar work, while \\"Bring On The Night\\" takes the mood down several notches to prepare you for suicidal speeding driver and his careening car in  \\"Deathwish.\\"<BR>Not to take you any further down, Sting brings the beat and the mood up to start the second side of the album with \\"Walking On The Moon.\\"  Another catchy lyric and melody lead by the bass with accentuation from the guitar and the reggae beat to wrap it all up.<BR>\\"You want something corny?/Well you got it.\\" That's the intro to Stewart Copeland's \\"On Any Other Day.\\" A song about one hell-ish day for our hero.  It's fun, upbeat and yes, corny. A very underrated, but great song.  Sting returns to his longing ways with the clever and beautiful \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You.\\"<BR>The final three songs on Regatta are my favorite.  They're not the \\"hits\\" that most remember, but they are well crafted songs that maybe don't have the pop hook, but each has its own moment that makes it a great tune.  \\"Contact\\" is strange and dark, it smacks of the same slightly stalking theme to come later in \\"Every Breath You Take. \\"  Likewise, \\"Does Everyone Stare\\" could be considered the precursor to \\"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic.\\"  Our hero can't get the nerve up to ask out the girl of his dreams.  Once again, clever lyrics and a great \\"clunky\\" melody put you in the shoes of the unrequited.  The album wraps up with hectic \\"No Time This Time.\\"  I don't know how many times I played the air drums along with Stewart on this one!<BR>Perhaps the most \\"reaggae-ish\\" of The Police albums, Regatta does not disappoint.  You should buy every album The Police put out, but if you can afford only one, Regatta gives you the best taste of what The Police had to offer.
0440213525|5.0|The Client is one of John Grisham's best. An eleven-year-old boy and his eight-year-old brother stumble upon a suicide victim while having a secret smoke. The eleven-year-old, Mark Sway, ends up in the victim's car and learns the location of a dead senator. The victim is a lawyer, and his client, the killer of the senator, learns what innocent Mark Sway knows. Mark's poor little brother goes into shock and doesn't come out. Now the FBI is pressing on Mark to learn the location of the dead body, for it is crucial evidence to a murder trial. The killer has already threatened to kill Mark if he tells. Deciding not to tell, he is put in jail for contempt, and will remain there if he doesn't tell. Will he tell? Or will the killer walk away? <BR>John Grisham is very descriptive. Every scene I saw in my head, like a movie in my mind. The dialogue in the book became harsh in some spots, but very few. The book was 1st person point of view of Mark Sway.
B0000024ZC|5.0|The kind of album that could only have been made in the early seventies. Dancefloor un-friendly time signatures, top level musicianship and long involved compositions. G.G. were always ahead of their contemporaries (perhaps except King Crimson) and they made unsettling music which is beautifully illustrated here. Mr Class and Quality is possibly the standout track with Schooldays in 2nd place. They never quite managed to be as bold as this on sucessive albums (possibly \\"Knots\\" from Octopus) and they finaly found themselves [cutoff] by their record company a few years later. It's a time capsule from when rock music had no boundaries or barriers.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is why SACD was invented.  Brilliant sonic quality across the entire spectrum, precision imaging, and undistored sound at all levels.  Don't waste time reading this.  Buy the disc and listen - in some ways for the first time!!! -- to a perfect CD.
6305807930|4.0|Dario Argento is the godfather of Italian horror! Inferno is, in my opinion, one of his finest movies. If you're in it for the gore, buy Deep Red instead. However, if you love occult flicks where the horror is symbolic and on a grander, more menacing scale, you might just enjoy this. The movie revolves around the three mothers, women of unspeakable power who control the fate of entire cities. The key to discovering their secret lies in the pages of an alchemist's book, but those secrets seem to cost the lives of all who try to uncover them. There is quite a bit of violence and blood for those who enjoy it, and plenty of mystery and intrigue. This film should be savored like a fine wine.
B000089RW0|4.0|I really liked this movie.  It had all the elements that I enjoy in the horror genre.  This has ghosts, the devil, a great abandoned ship with treasures aboard.  I particularly enjoyed the beginning scenes where we find out what happened to the original passengers.  The scene where the cable snaps was wonderfully done.  I also enjoyed the flash-back scene where the main ghost shows Julianna M's character what has occured on the ship and who the big, bad devil person is behind everything. Another thing I enjoyed about this movie is that it showed that people can be self-sacrificing and not just out for a buck; that money is not more important that helping others and saving your own soul.<br />I saw this at the theatre and again rented it and watched it three more times.  Dark Castle should be proud of this one.  It is as good as House on Haunted Hill was.  I hope they keep up the good work.  Basically, give this a try.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00005R87Q|1.0|Besides great lookin cars, and interesting,uh, uh, nevermind. This was one of the silliest movies EVER. What the heck? Cars do not go that fast , nitro or not. And the plot was like a stew sitting in the fridge for weeks without being touched.<br />Vin Diesel is a good actor, yet here it's just a cashbag to do. Paul Walker is the only sharp act here in the flick. Not bad. <br />And the fact that after seeing this flick, street racing went up 200%...well, proves that this is a movie not to make if you dont want to be a bad influence.<br />Vroooom-pah-puff-putzzzzzzz.....
B00006LFGD|5.0|This is an incredible album, full of memorable new and old recordings. Not one of these songs isn't fabulous! There is no one who sings like Streisand and here she is coupled with some of the all time greats. Her partners include the likes of old time legends Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Harold Arlen, and Ray Charles. You'll also hear magnificent duets with Michael Crawford ('Music Of The Night'- one of my favorites), Donna Summer, Barry Gibb and Barry Manilow(this one's new). And some talented newcomers like Bryan Adams that even my seventeen year old son enjoyed hearing. Another new treat is 'All I Know Of Love' with Josh Groban, a supremely talented newcomer. This is a must have album for fans of music and of Streisand !
B000069CWE|5.0|The fact of the matter is, (and this is pretty sad), that I like the remixes of the original for once. The remixed and rerhymed &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; counterpart has got me hooked. Unlike most remix albums, you won't find club beats and heavy dubs here. The music here stems from pure creativity. Highlights include the &quot;In the End&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot; remixes.
B00008LOS1|2.0|This CD explains it all.  Just because something made it to tape doesn't mean it's worth the time or our money to buy.  As much as I like The Who, this CD is a big disappointment.  Apparently they've learned something from Jimi Hendrix's relatives who continue to release mediocre performances and claim they're just-discovered gems.  Buy the original Who's Next and forget all the extra [stuff], and save some money too.
B00005JLK1|3.0|Steve Beck started off as a Special Effects Art Director for Industrial Light and Magic on \\"Indiana Jones and the Lost Crusade,\\" \\"The Abyss,\\" and \\"The Hunt for Red October.\\"  That explains why the strength of Beck's first two films as a director, \\"Thir13en Ghosts\\" and \\"Ghost Ship\\" have been triumphs of set design.  Unfortunately, with this 2002 horror film once again the set design overwhelms the story and characters.<br />Julianna Margulies, who stars in \\"Ghost Ships\\" as Epps, has described the film as \\"The Shining\\" meets \\"Dead Calm,\\" and it is certainly impossible not to watch this film and find echoes of previous horror films that you have seen since we are talking about a haunted house movie set on an ocean liner (which reminds me of \\"Alien\\" more than anything else).  What else is there to inject new blood into this horror genre besides new locations for recycled stories?<br />Actually Mark Hanlon and John Pogue do try to come up with something different.  The opening sequence of the film is one of the grossest you have ever seen and I can guarantee you that it terms of the mystery it presents the audience you will never see the solution coming.  Unfortunately, that solution ends up being rather over the top (when you come up with something too far fetched for a horror film you know that you are going to have problems).  More importantly, ... which is the more unforgivable sin in this genre.<br />Forty years after the blood bath of the opening sequence the titular vessel is discovered by a salvage crew in the Bering Sea.  This is a very odd place for a trans-Atlantic Italian ocean liner to end up, but this does not bother Murphy (Gabriel Byrne) or his crew, who are too consumed by the dollar signs dancing in their heads to worry about things like the fact that the rusted ship keeps doing the now you see it, now you don't routine on their radar.  Once aboard Epps, the character who has the virtue of having more brains and guts than the rest of the crew combined, encounters the ghost of little girl Katie (Emily Browning), who keeps suggesting the visitors want to get off the ship right now.  Of course, if they did that there would be no film and all this great set design work would be for naught.<br />\\"Ghost Ship\\" is another in a long series of disappointing big budget horror films that have been foisted off on us in the past several years.  Apparently the lesson of \\"The Blair Witch Project,\\" which had no special effects to speak of but still managed to be scary for a whole lot of people, is lost on Hollywood.  The explanation for the \\"Ghost Ship\\" is quite convoluted and even taken at face value a rather inefficient way of accomplishing such a task.

0790741520|5.0|I don't watch a lot of \\"contemporary action\\" flicks, but this one is really good. To me, its scenario of a jetliner being used as a weapon of terror has an eerie prescience that lends a touch of horror and plausibility that its makers, back in 1996, probably didn't anticipate.  Kurt Russell plays Dr. Donald Grant, a think-tanker who, through a series of plot twists, finds himself, along with a technical engineer (Oliver Platt) and a special-forces team (John Leguizamo, Joe Morton, B. D. Wong, Whip Hubley), secretly boarding a 747 that has been hijacked by a fanatic Islamic terrorist (David Suchet) and his band--most of whom don't have a clue about his secret agenda, a nerve-gas bomb whose presence Grant has deduced from his studies of the perp. Their mission: find and disarm the bomb and take down the terrorists before they can slaughter the entire East Coast. With the help of a stewardess (Halle Berry) and a plainclothes air marshal (Richard Riehle), they do both, only to find that the pilots have been killed and Grant, who's never flown anything bigger than a single-engine Cessna, must get the damaged liner down safely. The tension keeps ratcheting up steadily as complications are tossed into the Americans' path: the loss of their leader (Steven Seagal) and much of their equipment, an injured team member (who happens to be its bomb expert), the discovery of failsafes on the bomb and a sleeper agent aboard who can set it off manually, and a flight of combat jets prepared to shoot the plane down. Even after you've viewed it once, you'll still find yourself jamming your foot on the brake in the last few minutes as the crippled liner makes a long terrifying slide through ranks of parked small craft and into an earthen berm. A wild ride and one that any lover of nonstop action should enjoy.
B000001FW9|5.0|Look, forget &quot;prog rock&quot; or any other comfortable label you could slap on this album to describe it : IT DOESN'T WORK.<br />  From the original liner notes - &quot;We have recorded each composition with the one thought - that it should be unique, adventurous and fascinating.&quot; And they are - every song (with the possible exception of Plain Truth) takes you straight into a bizarre dreamstate where our world does not exist.....<br />  I'm finding it difficult to articulate what this album means to me. It is one of the pinnacles of 20th century creativity. I am a huge Gentle Giant fan, but, for me, none of their other albums top this one. They began to define their sound after this and, in the process, lost some of the mystery.<br />  It goes way beyond any convenient term like &quot;progressive rock&quot; and into divine inspiration. No other record can touch this one in terms of sheer wonderful imagination.<br />  As a songwriter/musician, I can only desperately try (in vain) to create music as mystical and awesome as this. It is an example of genuine human innovation triumphing majestically over our mundane concerns of &quot;profit&quot; and &quot;sales units&quot;. Thank you, Gentle Giant.<br /><br />  ....it's pretty evident I dig this album, eh??....
B000002V0Q|5.0|This cd I believe is one of their best albums ever!  I give all A+'s to each of the songs, especially Countdown to Extinction (title track).  It's a really good song! After all, it reminded me alot of Metallica's self titled album that was released in 1991.

B000085RTZ|4.0|The latest release from Florida's Kamelot is suprising a little and refreshing. This time they took a more proggy approach although this is still excellent power metal but IMHO their most mature release yet. The storyline is interesting but this really showcases their talent. Khan's vocals are definitely up there with the best in the biz, if not the best (see Lost Horizon's Daniel Heiman). Axeman Thomas Youngblood has really stepped up his fretboard wizardry and drummer Casey Grillo is as amazing as usual. Another great album from one of the genre's best bands! Highlights include: &quot;Center of the Universe&quot; (a klassic Kamelot song), &quot;Farewell&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Paradise&quot;, &quot;Wander&quot; (no wonder Khan named Geoff Tate of Queensryche as his favorite singer!), &quot;Descent of the Archangel&quot;, &quot;A Feast for the Vain&quot;, &quot;Lost &amp; Damned&quot; (excellent original sound), and &quot;III Ways to Epica&quot;. Any fan of Kamelot or Euro power metal should definitely get this killer CD!
B000002KBU|5.0|And when I say best album ever, I don't just mean best album ever by Joni - I mean best album ever of all time!  There are so many highlights on this disc, it would be impossible to list them all in the space provided.  Some of my personal favourite tracks are Blue and River.  But it seems every song on this album has moments that will send chills up and down your spine. Buy this album and it will change your life for the better!  It is absolutely stunning!  Joni, if you ever do happen upon this page, I love you for recording Blue ...
B000089RVX|5.0|Let's keep this short...<br />This is the best CD ever, buy it now!<br />How's that for short? :)<br />Seriously though, this is one of the most amazing albums I've ever heard.<br />I was first introduced to Evanescence the same way most of you were, through their single &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;.<br />I purchased the CD expecting more songs similar to Bring Me To Life but wow it's even better!<br /> -Going Under ... This is an amazing song, when I first heard it after buying the CD I got chills, I knew this was going to be an awesome album. The chorus is really great and it gives me chills every time!<br /> -Bring Me To Life ... Everyone's heard this one already so I'll just say it's a good song.<br /> -Everybody's Fool ... Another great song, nice beat and good chorus.<br /> -My Immortal ... Wow! This song is real nice, it's a slow song with piano music. It's kind of sad but beautiful. The first song that really shows how great Amy Lee's voice is.<br /> -Haunted ... Oooh creepy music and FX on Amy's voice. This is a fun song and once again a great chorus.<br /> -Tourniquet ... Another awesome song, great chorus, great beat, good stuff. There's some parts in this song that Amy does something with her voice, I can't explain it but it's just amazing.<br /> -Imaginary ... Great song.<br /> -Taking Over Me ... A really great song, incredible singing again by Amy Lee.<br /> -Hello ... One of my favs, amazing song, a little sad but it's such a great calming song.<br /> -My Last Breath ... A really good song.<br /> -Whisper ... Cool song, I love the way Amy sings the part that goes &quot;I know I can stop the pain if I will it all away&quot;, and amazing chorus! Awesome guitar solo too, but sadly, it's the last song on the album :(<br />Amazing album, Amy Lee is amazing, this is like nothing I've heard before and I strongly recommend it!
B000089RVX|5.0|Even since I heard &quot;bring me to life&quot;, I've been hooked on the song, after hearing the album online, I had to buy it. The lead singer's vocals give it a haunting feeling to every song. The best song on this album has to be &quot;my immortal&quot;, and &quot;going under&quot;. If you like Linkin Park, POD, or Tori Amos, you'll love this CD.
0385504209|4.0|Not since the breathlessness of \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" or \\"The Bourne Identity\\" have I read a thriller this riveting.  Dan Brown sinks the hooks in and drags us through the night hours with a plot that won't let go.<br />\\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" like Ludlum's classic \\"The Gemini Contenders,\\" deals with secrets within secrets of the Catholic Church.  In this case, the Church has tried to suppress certain relics that would cause embarrassment and doubt for many of its billion believers.  The relics, discovered by the Knights Templar during the Crusades, have been entrusted to a line of guardians to this present age.  The problem: the guardians are being murdered, threatening the knowledge of this ancient secret.  When a renowned symbologist and a female cryptologist find themselves joined at a murder scene in the Louvre, they are about to go on a twenty-four hour dash for their lives and for the survival of the secret, as hinted at by the Da Vinci Code.<br />Brown not only keeps the pace at a gallop for the full 454 pages, he deals out clues and deceptions and word games like a Vegas dealer flipping cards.  (In fact, the origin of the four suits of cards is even broached in this fascinating book!)  Somehow, with mesmerizing skill, Brown draws us deeper into the mystery without setting our heads spinning.  But you might find yourself nodding, smiling, and gasping in reaction.<br />Ultimately, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" swings the pendulum from run-of-the-mill thriller to a discourse on religious roots.  Yes, I believe the Church has put forth a male-dominant view of God that is inconsistent with the Bible.  The Bibles states in Genesis that both man and woman were created in God's image.  Where Brown, or his Knights Templar, might swing too far the other way is in asserting God as the sacred goddess instead.  Biblically, yes, God is spirit, encapsulating all the traits of man and woman in the divine.  However, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" dips into pagan practices and gnosticism, calling into question the veracity of Scripture.<br />As a thriller, this book can hardly be beat.  As a treatise on spirituality, it comes up suspect on factual and theological levels.into question the veracity of Scripture.<br />As a thriller, this book can hardly be beat.

0553212737|3.0|'Emma' is the first Jane Austen novel I've read in 20 years.  My earlier experiences (with 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility') were disappointing; they seemed to be overly genteel and without substance.  Was 'Emma' any different?  Er,.. no.<br />The first thing that grabs you about 'Emma' is that it reads like a play.  It is almost all dialogue.  No action, no flowing descriptions of the early 1800s England country ... just talk.  This makes for a very tiresome read.<br />Worse, the story (about a sweet young thing who busily plays matchmaker without any consideration of her 'victims' or her own love life) is rather [bad].  Any dramatic moments are very tame.  Emma's high society world is so devoid of emotion it is any wonder they bother living at all.  And in Emma's world there are no bad guys, no poverty, ... and no one seems to work for a living.  Think 'Ozzie & Harriet' transported back 150 years and plopped into rural England and you've got the idea.<br />So why bother with 'Emma'?  Purely out of respect for the author, and her legacy as one of the founding female writers of modern English literature.  She attempts, although not very successfully, in writing on matters other than soap operatic tosh (\\"gothic novels\\") her female peers did during that time.  True, other woman writers have since greatly eclipsed anything Jane Austen has done.  But she was the pioneer.  So please give at least one of her novels a try.
B00008H2LB|5.0|the answer is YEA! Meteora is an awesome album, better then Hybrid Theory in my opinion. I can listen to the album on repeat several times without skipping a single track.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Elephant is nowhere near as good as White Blood Cells, which is their masterpiece.  This newest album is actually from 2002 and it shows, some of the tracks feel moldy, like sub-par B-sides or bad rehashes of their other great songs. A weird ordering does nothing to give the album an overall flow.  Certainly there are some standout tracks such as Seven Nation Army, but on the whole this is merely average and should have been released as a 5 track EP, or as an &quot;unreleased&quot; CD after the band is dead and gone.  Not to knock the Stripes as a band- this is probably still going to be the best rock album of the year- but when you're competing against your own brilliant self it's better to stop while you're ahead.
B00006690G|5.0|I bought this cd after seeing the movie 8 Mile.  At first I thought it was somewhat offensive, but after listening to the lyrics more closely I think that some of it is very funny, and all of it is full of emotion.  I love it, it is one of my favorite cds.  It is probably not for everyone, but what music really is?
B00005YTFG|5.0|&quot;Camille&quot; musicalized for the DVD era, this post disco potpourri is a flamboyant, kinetic rollercoaster, that features an idealized, anachronistic vision of 1900's Paris, with an explosive musical soundtrack of this turn-of the century (with incredible versions of hit songs of Elton John, Madonna, Queen and even Nirvana, among others). <BR>Bazz Luhrman's over-the-top, entertaining and emotionally overpowering masterpiece is definitely an improvement from his Romeo + Juliet, if it's certainly not-for-all tastes. Even to devotees of classic musicals, Moulin Rouge won't be specially satisfying, but if you are a real musical fan, you know that it's always been a genre that constantly break its own rules. <BR>Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor make a wonderful pair (and they both sing quite well!).
B000002NBY|5.0|I listen to this album and my heart almost can't take it. The album makes me want to cry with joy. This album is simply one of the most Beautiful things that this world has ever produced. I feel the need to BEG everyone to buy it or somehow hear it.
B000065U1N|3.0|...which make this look like another one of those, \\"Gee whiz, aren't we brave and noble Americans GREAT?\\" propaganda jobs.  Instead, as one of the characters says at the end, this is a view of soldiers fighting a war not out of some misguided brainwashed-ideology but for each other---\\"for the guys next to you.\\"  Nice contrast to the current Iraq war propaganda of beating up on Third World countries as a \\"war on terror\\" and \\"fighting for freedom and our way of life\\" BS.<br /><br />Ridley Scott has always been a visually superb director, and he brings all the style and vividness of his camera to the action scenes, which are excellent and engrossing.  Actually some of the film is reminiscent of his sci-fi classic, \\"Blade Runner.\\"  Overall there's not much character development, zero big-picture historical or political explication.  In short, it's a pretty simple buddy-flick, so don't expect any high art here.<br /><br />The film does beg the question, though: WHY \\"leave no man behind?\\"  Why do we Americans value single individual lives so darn much?  This whole fiasco in Mogadishu would never have occurred if they had simply left the soldier who fell out of the helicopter at the beginning---costing the lives of 17 Americans and at least 1000 Somalis (not to mention all the wounded on both sides).  Wouldn't it be more intelligent to train soldiers going into combat to simply accept death/capture as an inescapable fact of war?  That's how the Japanese soldiers in WW2 were trained, in the samuri tradition: you view yourself as a dead body already, so you fear nothing and can do anything, without fear or doubt or hesitation.  It starts getting ridiculous when some of the Rangers in the film put themselves and others at risk just to retrieve the corpses of a few of their fallen comrades...<br /><br />3 and 1/2 stars.
B00008H2LB|2.0|This album in all honesty is weak. It hardly shows any maturity from Hybrid Theory, and in truth is a degradation from HT. After hearing many hypes of LP trying new things and reinventing themselves, this album is 36 minutes of the same stuff over and over. Don't get me wrong, \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" is good and classic LP at that, but a whole album of the same stuff gets old. But its okay, I have faith in LP that they will take bolder steps next album and become a more matured band like Incubus. Right now, they're stuck in a rut, doing what Limp Bizkit would do. They're immensely talented, but songs that go rap-chorus-rap-chorus-bridge-chorus everytime get old. These guys are great, which is why I'm holding them to a higher standard than everyone else.<br />Bottom Line: Linkin Park is good, but this album fails. It will get a few plays and I'll forget about it.

B00008CLOA|5.0|So is it as amazing as it should be? In a word, yes. But shouldn't I talk about it at length? I mean after all, that is the purpose of writing reviews. It's an excuse to sound intelligent.<BR> <BR>I'll start by saying that the price for what you get is just great. In 1993 I recall my first purchase of the Dark Side 20th anniversary release. It was a decent remaster, and sounded great for the time. ... When you also consider that this disc is a hybrid, which will play in any standard CD player as well....it makes no sense to purchase a regular CD of Dark Side anymore. This will no doubt boost the market for SACD; something which I find to be a wonderful development which will no doubt cast a dark shadow over the competing but inferior DVD-Audio format. It is my personal wish that this release will be the first nail on DVD-Audio's coffin.<BR> <BR>Ok, personal feelings aside....let's talk about this disc. The surround mix is breathtaking. Guthrie has succeeded in making the music truly three-dimensional. Throughout my listening, I often found myself amazed that the original masters are 30 years old. Or maybe the original masters just always sounded that good, only we couldn't hear that until SACD and its DSD encoding. This is as close to hearing the original master tapes as we have ever been able to get at home.<BR> <BR>Dark Side was originally recorded on a 16 track system, which meant that when the final mixdowns were made into two-tracks for home audio listening, lots of the sound would have to end up muddled together and obscured. Now that the channels can be mixed with five independents, we get to hear every breathtaking nuance of each instrument and voice. You truly experience the album almost for the first time, sometimes hearing things you never knew were there.<BR> <BR>Even played on the SACD stereo (2 channel) layer, the recording is still breathtaking. The timbre, tone and general feeling with the new DSD transfer is so transparent that one feels like they are listening to the master tapes themselves, even in two channel audio. Pink Floyd is right there in your room, jamming like mad.<BR> <BR>Guthrie's work has also made the red-book layer (regular CD) better than any previous release. I have the fortune of being able to play both at once and switch back and forth on my amp. There is a great difference between the two; the older disc seems boxed-in, somewhat lower in fidelity. The seperation between the instruments is also a little on the muddy side, whereas the new release has a quality that is more open and airy. Even if you don't have an SACD player yet....I would strongly suggest that you purchase this disc. Not only is it the best release of Dark Side yet....it will also inspire you to purchase an SACD player....and explore a whole new world of music.<BR> <BR>The only regret I have about this release isn't even about the release itself. Rather it is about the quality of music that exists today. I mean here we are in 2003 with the advent of multichannel high definition music media, and the best thing we have to release on it is....30 years old! Now if that isn't proof that today's music is mostly [bad], I don't know what is.<BR> <BR>Production, content, and execution A+<BR> <BR>Overall listening pleasure A+
0465011020|5.0|If one reads accounts by survivors of the Soviet gulag, as well as its earnest imitations in China and North Korea, the similarities are impossible to miss.  Mr. Kang's account is special for the extreme rarity of books in English about North Korea's gulag, for the fact that Mr. Kang entered Yodok when he was a child and remained there until early adulthood, and for the fact that North Korea's labor camps are very much still in active operation.<br />One very interesting facet of Mr. Kang's memoir is his description of his growing interest in Christianity.  Ta Chen's recent 3-volume memoirs (Sounds of the River, Colors of the Mountain, and China's Son) have rather a similar tone: the brutality of the Chinese and North Korean Communist regimes made the Christian emphasis on brotherly love powerfully appealing to some of the young people who grew up at close range to the workings of communist governments.<br />Well worth reading!

Axl Rose has a very characteristic voice, and I'm certainly no fan of his high pitch strained approach. But I must admit that the G `N' R have written and performed some really good tunes, but it's obvious that they didn't have enough good material for two albums - too many fillers and too little highlights!<br />Songs like \\"14 years\\", the Bob Dylan cover \\"Knockin' on heaven's door\\", \\"Get in the ring\\", and \\"You could be mine\\" are the best tracks. The rest is a variety of average songs and fillers.
B00007E8V4|5.0|System of a Down is one of my favorites out of all the newer bands out there (meaning post '95 in my language), and they have genuinely won me over with their sound and political lyrics.  Combining the influence of thrash, alternative, and middle-eastern melody and rhythm topped with a distinct quirkiness, these guys have developed a trademark sound that is a refreshing breath of air, especially in comparison with much of the mundane music that is out there.  The lyrics are generally leftist and well grounded in fact and history, making SOAD a political force to be reckoned with as well.  This particular compilation of B-sides and unreleased tracks is astounding, to say the least.  From the quirky thrash of &quot;Chic 'N Stu&quot; to the Eastern-flavored &quot;Inner Vision,&quot; this album captivates the listener right from the start.  The Eastern thrash of &quot;Pictures&quot; is also an excellent track; in fact, I cannot think of any bad songs on this album!  Please do yourselves a favor and grab a copy of this album ASAP; it's well worth it, and you can learn something from it.

It's a shame that Slash got so much more attention than Izzy Stradlin - but that's another evidence that image and appearance is far more important in the music business than musical skills. Slash isn't at all a very talented guitar player (which you'll find out if you listen to his solo's) and Axl Rose's strained and high pitch squealing singing style can really get on your nerves. Although G'N'R were highly over rated, they actually managed to write some good songs like \\"Dust `n' bones\\", \\"Don't cry\\", \\"You ain't the first\\", and \\"November rain\\". The cover of \\"Live and let die\\" is rather attractive, but songs as \\"Garden of eden\\" just makes me wanna smash my stereo!<br />Some reviewer said that instead of two albums, G'N'R should have cut down the number of tracks and just released one album - that's exactly my opinion too. Get rid of all those annoying fillers and go for the best material.
B000059PQ2|5.0|Bad, inconsistent dubbing. Worse dialogue. Tepid characterisation. Head scratching (I mean you). All of this and more..... with a humungous dose of style and sinuous, synapse fizzling symbolism. Forget their detractors, you can't go wrong with this double set.
B000089A07|2.0|I just saw this film and I only enjoyed it because it reminded me of the superior 'Manhunter', the original Hannibal Lecter film.  'Manhunter' is a visual feast and 'Red Dragon' has a carefully-framed feel to it with less intense use of lighting and shadows.  The actors in 'Red Dragon' underplay to such an extent that we feel little or nothing for their characters.  The only actor who succeeds is the wonderful actor Philip Seymour Hoffman in a small role as a reporter.  The rest of the cast is weak, especially Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson.  Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, but here he is almost boring.  Brian Cox is a much better Hannibal in 'Manhunter'.  The biggest problem is Edward Norton's gentle portrayal of a man in torment.  There should be something just beneath the surface of his character Will Graham, not just haunting him but physically altering him.  We should believe he is capable of becoming a Lecteresque monster.  The characterizations are simpler and tamer than those in 'Manhunter'.  The dialogue is very similar in both films, but it is delivered in 'Red Dragon' so methodically that the chance to increase tension verbally is squandered.  If you like this film then you will probably love the Michael Mann film 'Manhunter'.  'Red Dragon' is a neutered beast.
B000002B7M|5.0|Yes a very good debut cd for the Ozz. It's a must have and this is the one you want not the newer remastered ones as they are misleading as the original bass and drum parts have been removed and replaced with inferior parts.<br />I love all of Ozzy's stuff, but his vocal style can get on your nerves though. He's more of a whiner than a true singer *lol*.
B00007AJGH|1.0|What the heck is wrong with Disney?!?!?  The ONLY version worth buying is the Original VHS release... TRUST ME.  Back a couple years when the first DVD release was made, it was quickly discovered to be CUT and ALTERED for younger audiences.  First, in the scene early in the film where Baby Herman throws a fit on the movie set.  In the original version, he walks under a woman's legs and sticks his arm up her dress and says \\"Excuse me Toots!\\".  On that DVD, Baby Herman's arm was re-drawn so it just stays by his side!  Another scene is when Valiant first meets Jessica Rabbit.  When he first enters the Toon Strip Club, we can see that Betty Boob is onstage with her shirt off and she's shaking her b%%b$ (don't get excited, her back is to the camera).  This scene is completely CUT from the DVD.  Later in the film when Jessica Rabbit and Valiant are riding on the car in Toontown... the car screeches out of control and crashes, throwing Valiant and Jessica onto the streets.  For a second or two in the original version, it was VERY obvious that Jessica had NO underwear on and the dress was very wide-legged.  In that first DVD, they added white underwear.  NOW WE HAVE THIS VISTA SERIES DVD!!  The version that they tote on TV as the \\"Definitive version\\"... AHH, yeah right.  They HAVE gone back and fixed Baby Herman's arm.  Now his arm reaches back up the dress.  THANK YOU.  But the scene of Betty Boob is still cut!!  Not only that, but the scene with Jessica being thrown from the car has been RE-DRAWN!!  Now her dress has been extended so that it is now pulled down revealing nothing!!  These scenes may sound like \\"No big deal\\" to the average viewer, but what of us who love WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?  What of us who want the film we remember seeing??  Altering this film is just as offensive as what Lucas has done to STAR WARS!!  Take my advice and STEER THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY from this trite.  If we all demand that we want ROGER RABBIT the way it WAS, and refuse to buy this new\\"Kid-Friendly\\" version... maybe Disney will take notice.  Maybe...
B00006G8G1|5.0|If you love Maiden, you owe it to yourself to pick this DVD up. The entire concerts rocks from start to finish and everyone's on top of their game. Bruce is totally amazing running all over the frikin place and nailing his parts dead on at the same time. The band itself is incredible, but we already know that don't we. The sound is excellent and it's very loud!!!!!!. The picture is crystal clear and the camera work is very cool. All in all, a must have for any true Maiden fan.<br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JLXC|5.0|This is a fun movie with incredible action! Amazing! Ben Affleck was a tad anoying but the movie rocks! Jennifer Garner id so hot and the movie is a wild ride! Im buying the DVD the day it comes out! See it!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. The most emotional rollercoaster i have ever been on. It helped and is still helping me through the tughet of times. Every single track on this haunting yet melodic disc has a special meaning. Put it this way, I am very picky about my music and most of the music i listen to is metal, if i love it everyone will love it. The album hasnt left my CD plyer since the day i got it. my favorite songs are &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, and &quot;My Immortal&quot;. Amy has a beautiful and comforting voice that sooths my soul even when she screams.This is a great band with alot to say and i think that they will go very far. Definatley pick this one up.
B000084T18|1.0|all i hear about these days is that 50 cent is takign over the music scene...thats the dumbest thign ive ever heard. but u gotta think...where is the music business going when 50 cent sells more cds then bands like 311?...this cd is joke...same old same old lyrics about ...blunts..mostly boring beats..theres nothign else to say. 50 cent is not the future of rap. Try bone thugs if you want good rap.
B000083E79|4.0|Just what the world needs, ANOTHER Greatest Hits album from Cher. At this point I think she has more compilation discs than regular discs!!! Since 1992 there have been four hits collections released (including this one) and several more label compilations. All of them more or less cover the same material. Of the four released this is probably my least favorite. The main reason for this being that I am not a fan of her most recent releases. \\"Believe\\" and \\"Living Proof\\" may have revived her career yet again, but musically they are techno ... . Tracks from both of those albums are included here. I gave this release four stars because it does pretty much cover all of her hits. So for the casual fan looking to find them all, they are here. I prefer her early 1970's and late 80's material over the more recent stuff. But few artists can claim to having hits in 1965 up thru the present day. Cher is one who can. <BR> By the way the other Hits collections released were \\"Cher's Greatest Hits 1965-1992\\" (import title) \\"If I Could Turn Back Time: Cher's Greatest Hits\\" (domestic version of previous title), \\"The Greatest Hits\\" (import title) and now \\"The Very Best Of Cher\\". All of these feature more or less the same material. Each collection does however feature a track or two not to be found on other collections.

B00000DOZE|3.0|There are some tracks on this album that really stand out, but not like other in this band has produced.
0060930187|1.0|\\"The Bell Jar\\" is one of the most pathetic, self-absorbent pieces of writing ever published. Esther tried to literally and figuratively dig her own grave and is to be pitied. If the writer dared to look beyond Esther, reading it might have been pleasurable and insightful. As it stands, Esther's character was written as to be so self-absorbed that she is barely aware of the world around her, and even when she dares to open her eyes, she sees nothing but the world against her. <br />Undoubtedly, at the time the novel was written, the world was very different then for women. But what I fail to see is any strength in Esther. Other than cower in a corner and cry, she appeared to want the world to cater to her. I'm sure this had a lot to do with her mental illness, but the book boils down to a pitiful tail of a girl who stood by and let the world swallow her up. I think this might make good reading for psychiatrists to peer into the world of insanity, but for the rest of us, it seems little more than a whiny tale of self-indulgence. The writing style of the book was quite good. The content was quite poor.
B000088E6D|5.0|got to tell you this c.d. is the best.  can't stop playing it.  What a beautiful voice, and the song selection is great...Bring on the next c.d. soon.
B000077VPU|3.0|Having attended the concert I feel that the producers of this set have missed an opportunity to truely capture the show. The dvd concentrates on the final set with the remaining members of Queen and their guests.<br />The concert was much more than that though understandly on video you are limited for space, but with a dvd you can pack more in. How about extreme spinal tap and all the others. I'm sure most people would be willing to pay for a 3 or 4 dvd set. I do enjoy the extras the rehearsal footage, the videos of freddie etc. It is an enjoyable dvd and doesn't ruin itself with extras that are only padding.<br />Get the dvd for the memories but make a copy of your old videos from the day before they wear out.
B000003TAL|3.0|When this album came out in 1988 (I was 23 at the time), I thought it was the most amazing thing I'd ever heard. It was the first album I'd ever heard by these guys, and it would not be an exaggeration to say that for a couple of years, I worshipped at the altar of this album (my poor neighbors!). Over time I ended up buying everything that Sonic Youth produced, and I now see this album as the low point of their talent and creativity. In the last few weeks I've spun a selection of their albums from Bad Moon Rising to NYC Ghosts and Flowers. This album is the oddball of the bunch. It came from nowhere and led to nowhere. <br />The production is muddy, the performances cold, the dissonance deeply offensive, and not nearly atoned for by the spots of beauty. I can play all of my other SY albums pretty loud, but every time I turn this one up, I expect either the police or mental health professionals to come knocking on my door. The truth is, I really can't listen to it at all anymore.<br />I love the band, their earlier work, their later work, it's all fantastic. This album is the sole exception. Anyone interested in hearing the essence of Sonic Youth in a couple of CD's should start with `Sister' (early) and `A Thousand Leaves' (late).
0070511136|3.0|There are some interesting ideas and advice in SPIN Selling. However, the author spends too much time praising his own research and bashing other sales books. Negative selling does not get one anywhere. This applies to both major and minor sales.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Guido is an ordinary man, even, apparently, a weak man. Charming but foolish, hardly hero material in the conventional sense. Yet, against enormous odds and with no resources but his love for his family and his wits, he finds a way to give his family the hope they need to survive the horror of the holocaust.<br />The genius of this film is in juxtapositions; of comedy and tragedy, of love and terror, of heroism and cruelty. And most of all, Benigni's ability to perfectly layer carefree silliness on overwhelming desperation. This is most poignently demonstrated in his final scene as he is marched away at gunpoint and gives his hidden son a last wink and grin that is also a grimace of fear and agony, and the silly marionette march he put on for his son's benefit that sags into a despairing slump; with these bits of body language we know that he has used up everything he had in his effort to save his child; the gunshot that follows is a mere formality.<br />This film has the ability to open a window in the soul. A window that might feel, at first, like a wound, but one which offers a view of the heroism of which even the most ordinary person might be capable.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|If I had to choose only one cd to listen to, it would definitly be t.A.T.u.'s debut album, &quot;200 KM/H In The Wrong Lane&quot;. From only hearing one song you can already tell the album's a big hit. Each song is different and catchy, with beautiful background music. Some songs are dance (Not Gonna Get Us), others are rock (How Is Soon?) and some are a mix of both genres, along with pop (Show Me Love). Some of the songs even have a little it of Russian in it, and some have whole verses in Russian. Two songs (All The Things She Said, Not Gonna Get Us) are included in the cd in this dramatic language. Overall, this is an excellent cd that I would recommend to everyone.
055357342X|2.0|2.5 stars.<br />Yes there is very good prose and very good characterization.  Yes it's something fresh with a very comlex plot. These were the things that made me love this series(and the reason for the 2.5 stars), but now there's the Red Wedding, which is by far more painful than anything he's written in the first two books. I know that I've never read anything more upsetting in my life. I'm not one to shun realism or bad things happening in books, but there is a fine line to walk, and here George Martin crosses that line. We must all remember that the main purpose of reading fiction is for ENJOYMENT, and really, what is left to enjoy after the Red Wedding? It seems that in ASoS Martin is more inclined to showing us the gritty realities of medieval times than writing something enjoyable, and to me that's not fiction, that's a documentary. There are other authors -like Terry Goodkind, Robin Hobb, and Tad Williams- who manage to lace their books with enough realism and pain WITHOUT GOING TO EXCESS. In those books, when something bad happens, you of course grieve and fill bad for a little while, but then you move on, and what's more, it makes the book more enjoyable, not less. Not so with this book. I actually had to stop and read another book before I could finish this one. To me that's not good fiction, because good fiction is supposed to HOOK you and not let go. Fiction is, after all, supposed to be fiction. This is, after all, supposed to be fantasy. It's not supposed to be completely real. <br />I loved the first two books and would hate to not know what eventually happens to all these characters I've come to love, but I don't think I could suffer another Red Wedding. George Martin has told me that he doesn't know if anything he writes will be that painful again, so I guess I'll just have to wait and see. I know that this time I'll be checking into A Feast for Crows before I buy it.

All 132 minutes (2 hours,12 minutes) are here.  No scratching, no popping and no skipping of footage.  The print is crystal-clear in beautiful black & white.  Special features on this DVD is the original theatrical trailer.  Also includes the 1990 featurette &#34;The Making Of It's A Wonderful Life&#34;, hosted by Tom Bosley.

There are interviews of Frank Capra, James Stewart and Sheldon Leonard.  Another featurette is &#34;A Personal Remembrance&#34;. A 1991 special tribute to Frank Capra, hosted by Frank Capra Jr. There is an interview with James Stewart.  A bit of trivia I would like to share is Larry Simms (who played &#34;Pete Bailey&#34;) and Danny Mummert (who played &#34;Little Marty Hatch&#34;) are also in this film , but not in a scene together.

B00008H2LB|5.0|A review from a cold Sweden.<BR>Thanks guys!!<BR>I´ve been a huge metalfan since 1981 ( the start of the Motley Crue Story ) and after several poor years for metal I found Hybrid Theory. This album really knocked me down. This was the music I was missing and after a year of constant listening I reated this as one of the 3 best albums I have( out of 400 ).<BR>My expectations for Meteora was to say huge. I told my self that<BR>it is impossible to do another album like HT....I mean that was the perfect album but.....<BR>...I bought Meteora the 23:rd of mars and closed myself in for 4 days.<BR>These guys has made it again!... How can this be!...BR>I really wish the guys in LP all luck in the world and I will be there by your side in Copenhagen ( 11JUN ).<br />How can I get a backstage pass????<br />For all LP fans.....dont miss   aztek sun´s new album...comming up.....this is metal with energy!...<br />Krille
0767020308|4.0|This is a production which is enjoyable to watch if not entirely memorable after the fact.  I personally think Kate Beckinsale makes the perfect Emma.  (I find it hard to imagine Gwyneth Paltrow in the same role, but I'm curious to see that production as well.) Raymond Coulthard is also perfectly cast as Frank Churchill, the quintessential Jane Austen deceptive young cad (and I mean that as a compliment!).  Mr Knightley, the eventual romantic interest for Emma, is played by Mark Strong, who does a very good job in the role although I must admit I had trouble seeing him as a romantic lead.  Samantha Morton is very appealing as Emma's shy friend, Harriet.<br />All in all, I give this production four stars.  Although it is nowhere near as compelling as the Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, or the Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson, it's still a well done film adaptation of a Jane Austen book - and that's not easy.  :)
0446608955|4.0|A Review by Cori<br />This book is about a place in the town of Beaufort, North Carolina. That a teenager named Landon   Carter remembers his last year of high school in 1958.  Where he meets a girl named Jamie who he expects to be just the minister's daughter. When he is with Jamie he starts to feel things he hasn't felt before and never thought he would feel. She also shows him kindness of the human heart. When she tells him a secret it changes what he thinks of her and life. <br />Three things I like about this book is it is a heartwarming story that shows the innocence of teenage love, the kindness of the heart, and that people can surprise you. It is a heartwarming story because it shows you happiness of love and the pain of the human soul to love a person so much it hurts. It shows the innocence of teenage love because it shows you can love someone with all your heart, but still have the experiences and pressures of adolescents. It shows the kindness of the heart because it shows how people in the world can be good at heart where good deeds can mean the world to people. Also it can show the kindness of the heart by how kind people are in their hearts even if they don't show it. This show how people can surprise you because it is also about how what you see is not always what you get. For example Landon is surprised by Jamie when he gets to know her. <br />I would recommend this book to people who enjoy love stories that are tragic but capture your heart. The type of readers who enjoy it would be people who like sweet love stories of teenage love. People who hate love stories and romance novel would hate it.
B00008J4P5|2.0|The secret ingredient to The White Stripes and White Blood Cells were unaffected performance, unpretentious manner, and their simple, unadorned honesty.  Sure, the concept of the band may have been affected, pretentious, and fake, but the music itself beautifully lacked those.  De Stijl just wasn't their equal, and Elephant also comes up lacking.<br />Let's start with the art.  It's too slick, and the red backwards 3's and the different covers in different regions of the world remind me distressingly of Pink Floyd's The Division Bell.  The back is an imitation of the classic Sixties bare-bones back cover.<br />Imitation?  Pretention?  This is not the simple truth that those other albums are about.  I feel a publicist's hand in this one, and I don't like it.  The whole \\"classic British studio\\" thing gave me pause while they were recording, and while the result isn't bad, it's rather sad that they're trying so self-consciously to follow in the footsteps of others.<br />Art wouldn't matter so much if it weren't for the music.  While the album has its share of great songs (the first four, You've Got Her in Your Pocket, Hardest Button to Button, and Girl You Have No Faith in Medicine), the pacing feels off-balance and the alternation between long grooves like Ball and Biscuit and short bursts of adrenaline like Hypnotise never really settles in.  Also, did they need to use the same Peel Sessions version of \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\"?  I already bought it once as a b-side...<br />To do a great song justice: \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" is a really successful reinterpretation of \\"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\\" as \\"There's No Home For You Here\\".  It could be just a talentless ripoff -- the chords are the same, the licks and fills very similar, and I swear Jack used that same solo on Dead Leaves one of the nights I've seen them -- but it ends up telling a very similar story in a very different way.  It's ace.<br />While Elephant is an album with many great songs, it's a shame it couldn't have been as perfect as the first and third.  Who knows, maybe the odd numbered White Stripes albums are the truly great ones.great songs, it's a shame it couldn't have been as perfect as the first and third.

B000024D4R|5.0|This is an album of music initialy composed and evolving through being played live for two years before its release. As a piece of art it is superb.Yet, musically it is rather simple, that is for a Floyd record, and not as multi-layered and complex as its predecessors though the many sound effects and spacey sound make it seem otherwise. But just listen to the drums, it's like hearing Charlie Watts hiting harder! <BR>This was a record it took me a long time to get used to: you have a feeling that you're not listening to something BEATIFUL. It's an uggly work and the music is nasty save the melodic and gloriously painful solo of Dogs and the two snippets of Pigs on the Wing. But great art needn't be beatiful: could you say Guernica is Beatiful?<BR>Lyrically it's the first Floyd album to deal with things earthly and it is actually not a band but Water's effort. Nevertheless, even if particular persons are mentioned this bleak statement will be valid as long as capitalist economy prevails. This is the transformation of a social statement into art and this can be seen most obviously in the magnificent cover where a particular (Battersea power station)is transposed out of space and time into symbolic order.
B000002MUW|5.0|I love the Meshell NdegeOcello guest starring.  It was really a great mixing of the two.  There is an exploration of the existential in Madonna's work now that shows a definitive maturity.  I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it.  Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us.  It is that work that interests the rest of us.
B000066744|4.0|This is a good movie. I bought it for my brother for christmas because he was raving about it. He had seen it on cable once and said it was a french movie that was just astounding. I didn't believe him untill I watched it. I couldn't leave the screen. It was just too captivating. I gave it four stars because it didn't have the depth that I thought it should have, but that in no way took away from the movie. FANTASTIC!!!

B000069KGM|5.0|I actually haven't heard Rhino's remaster release of this gem, but I just got a hold the &quot;Chicago Records&quot; issue. I had forgotten how great this album was. It truly borders on genius with wonderful arrangements, inspired guitar playing and great performances. I remember as a kid being baffled after listening to this album and then comparing it to the weak pop albums that came later on.<br />The sound on the Chicago Records release is worlds better than the Chicago II CD. Still not great, but quite listenable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes hard driving rock with some vibrant horns.

B00008CLOA|5.0|It is highly unlikely that the members of Pink Floyd could have ever foreseen the transcendent success of their album \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\" in 1973, nor its continuing longevity after 30 years. Further, it is doubtful that the members envisioned their album being played to the classic 1939 film \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" in place of its own dialog and soundtrack, whose scenes seem to coincide with the album's tracks. The album preceded the rise and fall of disco, punk, New Wave, glam rock and grunge (to name a few); as well as countless groups, many of which were inspired by its haunting melodies that have outlived most of them in the musical collective memory.  \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" was the ninth album (including soundtracks) that was recorded by Pink Floyd since its first album was released in May 1967: \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\".  The songs in \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" reflect the influence of the psychedelic sights and sounds of the 1960's, but also demonstrate the direction that the band took to create compelling sound effects using the latest technology available.  The result was an artistic masterpiece whose lyrics by Roger Waters can still be interpreted in many different ways: of war, racism, greed, wasted time and self examination to name a few.  I describe and rate (out of 5 stars) each of the songs on the album as follows:<br />1. \\"Speak To Me\\" (N/A).  An introduction starting with silence that slowly builds with various effects.<BR>2. \\"Breathe\\" (5). Slow and airy vocals and guitar.<BR>3. \\"On The Run\\" (4). Highly electronic instrumental with fast beat.<BR>4. \\"Time\\" (5+). An alarm clock and clock chimes begin this enigmatic song that moves with keyboards, percussion, and guitar.  This is followed by strong vocals with melodic choruses that have a choral accompaniment.  Next, powerful, instrumental guitar takes over which is later accompanied by the choir leading into next verse.<BR>5. \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" (5).  Piano and guitar begin this song who's wordless but very emotional female vocals are sung by Clare Torry.  A very emotional song overall.<BR>6. \\"Money\\" (5+). The clanking sounds of a mechanical cash register begin this song with strong guitar and vocals, as well as the saxophone played by Dick Parry.<BR>7. \\"Us and Them\\" (5+). Slow but emotional instrumental beginning highlighted by the saxophone as played by Dick Parry and followed by airy vocals, but whose choruses rise into a crescendo.<BR>8. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" (4.5). An instrumental that continues directly from the previous track.  Electronic, lots of guitar and keyboards.<BR>9. \\"Brain Damage\\" (5+). Light and airy guitar and vocals begin this song of a lunatic, then rises with a choral accompaniment during the choruses.<BR>10. \\"Eclipse\\" (5+).  Continues directly from the previous track with the same choral accompaniment.<br />Generations to come will more than likely continue listening to \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" by Pink Floyd, whose members include Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright.  Overall, I rate the album with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and will continue listening to it for years to come as I already have for years that have passed.  Since I don't have a SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc), I cannot comment on the album's quality heard on that, but the album does sound fantastic on a standard CD player.
B000002LGQ|4.0|There is an exploration of the existential in Madonna's work now that shows a definitive maturity.  I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it.  Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us.  It is that work that interests the rest of us.
B000089RVX|5.0|Recently seeing the video for Evanescence's song &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; inspired me to purchase their debut album entitled &quot;Fallen&quot;.  Evanescence was founded in Arkansas in the late 1990's by Amy Lee and Ben Moody.  With Amy Lee's hauntingly beautiful voice backed by percussionist Rocky Gray and hard-driving guitarists Ben Moody and John Lecompt, Evanescence created an exceptional repertoire of very melodic songs that combine intense harmony with hard rock.  Many of the songs are hauntingly dark and introspective and are nearly gothic in character.  Several of the songs also include piano, string or choral accompaniment.  My ratings (out of 5 stars) and descriptions for each of the eleven songs on the album are as follows:<br />1. &quot;Going Under&quot; (5). Starts with aggressive guitar, piano accompaniment and synthesized vocals; giving way to haunting chorus backed by aggressive guitar.<BR>2. &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; (5+). Starts with soft vocals with piano &amp; string accompaniment, but giving way to powerful chorus that includes aggressive guitar and guest vocalist Paul McCoy of the group 12 Stones.  Vocals then bounce between Amy and Paul quite effectively.<BR>3. &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; (5). Aggressive guitar and harmonized vocals give way to a brief ballad movement that includes a choral accompaniment before returning to the former.<BR>4. &quot;My Immortal&quot; (3.5). Very slow, percussionless ballad.  Though the song highlights Amy Lee's vocals (which are reminiscent of Sarah McLachlan) with piano accompaniment and later with string accompaniment, the song seems out of place on the album.<BR>5. &quot;Haunted&quot; (5). Gothic beginning with very haunting vocals joined later by aggressive guitar. Powerful guitar riffs follow, as well as a choral accompaniment.<BR>6. &quot;Tourniquet&quot; (4.5). Starts with somewhat aggressive guitar and synthesized vocals and continuing with aggressive choruses and strong guitar riffs.<BR>7. &quot;Imaginary&quot; (4.5). Haunting vocals begin with aggressive guitar, giving way to more harmonic verse accompanied by piano; but strong guitar returns for the chorus.  String accompaniment comes in later, which also joins the guitar for an aggressive finish.<BR>8. &quot;Taking Over Me&quot; (4.5). Aggressive guitar highlights this song with high, haunting vocals accompanied primarily with string instruments, but an overshadowed piano accompaniment can be heard several times.<BR>9. &quot;Hello&quot; (5). Slow, haunting and emotional vocal ballad that includes a piano accompaniment and occasional haunting guitar riffs.  Later enjoined with a cello accompaniment.  Very good highlight of Amy Lee's voice.<BR>10. &quot;My Last Breath&quot; (4.5). Synthesizer and aggressive guitar start, giving way to haunting and emotional vocals later rejoined with aggressive guitar and a string accompaniment during the chorus. Strong guitar riffs and key change about midway.<BR>11. &quot;Whisper&quot; (5). Starts with aggressive guitar, then giving way to soft vocals, but quickly turning up the volume on both.  String and choral accompaniment come in later to end the song on a powerful note.<br />Overall, I give this debut album a rating of 5 out of 5 stars and fully expect to hear more great songs from Evanescence in the future.  I highly recommend the album to anyone who enjoys new and original hard rock.

B00008H2LE|1.0|I bought this CD/DVD the first day it was released, listened to it once (cringing the whole time), put it back in the case, and sold it immediately without even watching the &quot;Making Of&quot; disc.  Unlike their first &quot;two&quot; CD's, I found Meteora to be incredibly dull.

After listening to the mostly dismal \\"Kid A\\" and this unnecessary live album, I've come to the conclusion that I am just another sucka who bought into the critics' hype and their over-glorification of mediocre bands like Radiohead, Built To Spill, and Yo-Yo-Ma Tengo.

Didn't we have a time?&quot;  just took me back to those days when i was 16 (I'm now 22) of watching the show, and hurrying to school the next morning to discuss it. Why why why was it cancelled!<br />Words cannot describe how much i loved this show!
B00000255X|4.0|I have every dylan cd, this one i passed up when it frist hit the stores. I  don't remember why? maybe i did'nt have the bread, could have been a bad day, but after listening to it again, I <BR>&quot;won't' BE PASSING IT AGAIN. THIS ONE HAS A Hightway 61 feel.

B00008H2LB|1.0|I really wanted to like it. It just sounds exactly like Hybrid Theory.....these guys did not evolve at all. The point of being a good musician is being able to evolve. It's the exact same formula from their previous stuff and I just didn't get it. They should have done less rapping and more singing. One star for the song &quot;Don't Stay.&quot; Just download that and don't bother with the rest of it unless you're a big hip-hop fan. Better luck next time guys.

B00008H2LB|5.0|When i first listened to Meteora, i was amazed at how well it was made.  Linkin Park used a huge variety of sounds but still kept the songs on a main path.  <br />1.Intro - not much to say about this 13 second intro to the album but leads into Don't Stay seemlessly<br />2. Don't Stay - a very hard song with a great chorus and and an awesome bridge<br />3. Somewhere i belong - a great song with a very oridginal and new sound, especially in the intro<br />4. Lying From You - a hard song with a rockin chorus and the perfect amount of screaming<br />5. Hit The Floor - The hardest song on the album, but still a good one. full of energy and fast<br />6. Easier to run - this song is my personal favorite with very hard guitar parts in the chorus but still a soft type song<br />7. Faint - a cool quick song with an awesome chorus and rap verses, a perfect mix<br />8. Figure.09 - a very hard beginning and straight into a fast rap verse and into a energetic chorus<br />9. Breaking The Habit - I especially like the blend of acoustic guitar, live strings, sound effects, and chester's amazing voice<br />10. From the Inside - A really deep song with a great beginning and brige, and singing in the verses<br />11. Nobody's Listening - a very different song with a Chinesse pan flute in the background throughout this oridginal song<br />12. Session - an insturmental song with mostly DJ Hawn's beats and some loud drum solos <br />13. Numb - a song based off the awesome intro and a great one at that.  A great end to a great album<br />Final Thoughts: overall, i give it two thumbs up.  This is one of the best CDs ive ever bought.  IF you don't have it, get it.
B000089RVX|1.0|If you are looking for a great christian cd, this one isn't it! I wouldn't recommend this cd to anyone especially a christian who thinks this band is a Christian band, they are NOT! I bought this cd thinking that it sounded cool until I read the lyrics. The lyrics are very disturbing. Especially since the lead singer of the band, Amy Lee claims that they are christians, just not a christian band. It makes you wonder about that when you read her lyrics.  12 stones, Kutless, 38th parallel are some great christian bands that don't compromise where there lyrics are concerned. Or if you are into the bands that aren't christian bands, but they claim to be christians, try lifehouse, p.o.d, or blindside. You wont find anything in there songs about the godess of imaginary light. Overall it is creepy freaky and very disturbing. There is definetly better things out there. I don't think this is what God ment when he said to be In the World, Not of It.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD collection.  If your into the Beatles, your gonna love this.  If your not a fan, your still gonna love it.  This DVD is all about the music.  The sound quality is so good, I had to lower all volume to be able to sit in the room, even at the normal level.  The sound is just fantastic.  And talk about cleaning up the footage.  They did a great job cleaning up the video footage, normally you would expect to see lines and/or fuzz, etc.  None here.  Great job folks.<br />I highly recommend this collection.
B000002U9W|5.0|This album has a marginal reputation at best, but don't be fooled!  It is a beatiful, coherent composition that needs no drugs to be breathtaking.  Every song is meticulous and thoughtful in both structure and instrumentation, and as Pink Floyd albums go, this is (for me) the absolute apex.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I suppose that some Linkin Park fans would still say this is better than hybrid theory and that this is a great album even if it was just 60 minutes of toliet flushing. <br />However, I was very disapointed. I LOVED hybrid theory and have listened to it all the way through THOUSANDS of times, literally (I have a long commute everyday and can listen to it all the way through 3 times sometimes in one day). I didn't buy hybrid theory when it first came out because the only song I had heard then was One Step Closer and was worried it was the only good song. But enough people said that One Step Closer was only the tip of the iceberg so I bought it. And boy was I impressed. <br />In an interview they said that they didn't want songs where you could \\"pick out the rap part\\" and then \\"Here's the rock part\\". And I think they did a very good job balancing this on hybrid theory.<br />Then came Meteora. To sum it all up, it's not very good. The singer sounds like he has lost his voice. Only ONE song, IMHO, has actual \\"singing vocals\\" in it. The rest of the time he's yelling out lyrics on the same 3 or 4 notes. Not very good at all. You know when they yell \\"SHUTUP, SHUTUP...\\" in One Step Closer, well, that's about how I'd describe his \\"singing\\" now. Just one continuous yell.<br />Then the rapping. How many songs can you rap in using similar tempo and rhythm? I don't know cause I don't remember how many songs are on Meteora, but I'd say they try to do that on 6 or 7 of them. <br />Would it kill them to have a guitar solo? Can they only play power cords over and over again? I mean, a riff or a fill here or there would kill them? They did it on hybrid theory just fine. The guitarist, in the interview on the bonus dvd said he wanted to try something different. Well he did. He didn't play anything difficult or complicated.<br />So is it any good? Of course. It's ok. But not one song will really knock your socks off. The first song is probably the best, and maybe that's cause it's pretty much \\"one step closer\\" with the same rhythm but notes played in a slightly different order. Somewhere I belong is probably the worst song on the album IMHO. Easier to Run is probably one of the better songs. Faint, the other radio release is one of the better songs also, but a prime example of the yelling that is supposed to pass as vocals. <br />First albums from new artists are usually pretty good, cause they've had years and years to decide what their best songs are. That's why second tries usually [stinks]. It's obvious that \\"mike\\" (the rapper) wrote all the songs, or maybe he wrote just one long song and they broke it up. <br />Don't get me wrong here. I'm not a reviewer who says linkin park [stinks], always has, always will. I really liked hybrid theory. And was really looking forward to Meteora. But screw this. One of them jokes on the DVD that \\"they had joked about doing the same exact thing they did on hybrid theory\\". They should have. That actually would have been less of a disapointment.<br />The should listen to themselves. \\"Forfeit the game, before somebody else takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame. Cover up your face, you can't win the race, the pace is too fast you just won't last\\" BOOM!

B00003CX5P|4.0|The Phantom Menace<br />Although Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is supposedly, as most film critics and many fans have said since 1999, a disappointing prequel to perhaps the most popular film trilogy, I think it is an enjoyable and yes, even interesting \\"origins of\\" story. Like many Star Wars fans, I wanted to know how and why the Galactic Republic morphed into the evil Empire, how Senator Palpatine wormed his way to be Emperor, and most of all, how and why Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader.<br />I theorize that in the 16-year-gap between trilogies, fans had dreamed up scenarios far different from what we ended up seeing on May 19, 1999. Maybe they thought Anakin was a bad seed who went around wearing black and using the Force to choke other children....or that he was the Anakin we did finally get to see in Episode II, already a Jedi in training...I do know that there was grousing on three different topics, in order of ascending disappointment:<br />The movie was way too political.<br />Anakin was a 9 year old kid.<br />Jar Jar Binks.<br />There were also complaints about the pre-release hype (and maybe that was warranted) and that The Phantom Menace was really a commercial for Hasbro's related toy line (which may also have been warranted to some degree). But, for all that.....<br />The Phantom Menace is a fine Star Wars film! I was caught up in its storyline from the opening logos to the end credits. The characters, whether they were new ones (such as Qui-Gon Jinn, Padme Amidala, Shmi Skywalker, or even those CGI creations Watto and Jar Jar), or younger versions of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and the boy destined to be Darth Vader, gave the Classic Trilogy's story some depth and complexity. Finally we got to see the girl who will be Luke and Leia's mother....the Jedi Order and how Knights served and fought at the height of their power....and perhaps most revealing of all, how a powerful democracy could be replaced by dictatorship by clever insiders.<br />Maybe in part that is why Episode I somehow disappointed die-hard fans: at times The Phantom Menace does feel a bit like a civics lesson rather than space opera. I have not delved into all the message boards that gripe about TPM's shortcomings, but I suspect that most fans were expecting Palpatine's rise to power to be violent and sudden (like Castro's takeover of Cuba). George Lucas' intent was to illustrate how Julius Ceasar and Adolf Hitler took power: by using democracy's strengths against itself. Palpatine/Darth Sidious doesn't storm the Senate Hall in a 1917 Russian Revolution mode; he worms his way into high office by first weakening Supreme Chancellor Valorum in a manufactured \\"scandal\\" (which is detailed in Cloak of Deception, a novel by James Luceno), then using the crisis on Naboo - which he as Darth Sidious has conceived - to cause an election for a new Supreme Chancellor.<br />But if it did have its slow expository scenes, The Phantom Menace also had moving segments. The thrill of the Podrace....Anakin's sad farewell scene with his mom....Qui-Gon's appeal to the Jedi Council to allow him to train Anakin as a Jedi....the exciting Battle of Naboo on three fronts......This was Star Wars action at its best.<br />And yes, by Golly, I even like Jar Jar!that is why Episode I somehow disappointed die-hard fans: at times The Phantom Menace does feel a bit like a civics lesson rather than space opera.

B00005JLXC|5.0|Many people say bad things about Daredevil. I am an avid comic book reader and felt that Daredevil is perhaps one of the best comic adaptions ever. Its story may not be as family-friendly or epic as that of Spider-Man or Superman, but it is far more faithful to its origins. The action was amazing, and the special effects were decent. This movie is right up there with Batman and X-Men.

The drummer is of absolute talent, and Chinos lyrics and style of song writing and singing are unique to him and him alone. Others try, but none compare to DEFTONES.<br />If you are new to the Deftones ask yourself this much, do I like heavy music, with trippy and psychedellic sounds? If so, this may be for you.

0312958455|3.0|As in Greek tragedy, this story starts in the middle of the action.  Harry Bosch, an LAPD homicide detective, has been relieved of duty and must attend psychological evaluation sessions.  Through these sessions, we learn about how he got to this point, and we see the hint of what is to come.  Harry must deal with why he became a detective and what he hopes to accomplish before finding closure for his mother's death.<br />Michael Connelly, the author, has many balls in the air for Bosch to deal with.  Always in the back of the reader's mind, and Bosch's mind, are the many different things going on in his life.  Watching how Bosch deals with each one shows the author's skill in linking all the pieces together.  Parts of the plot may seem like deux et machina, but in review, Connelly had everything in mind all along.<br />There is a love interest for Bosch, but the character seems more like an afterthought.  Due to his brief association with her, more trouble brews for him at the police force.  It does seem a bit too contrived.  I was also expecting to get more from the psychologist, but that would have been too cliched.<br />I would recommend to fans of crime stories.

6303998704|3.0|A little reminiscent of Ghost Story, this film shows us the tale of a young organist who seems to be the sole survivor of a car crashing into the river.  Her life continues as if torn between this world and the one beyond.<br />This is where the box is misleading.  When I watched the movie, I waited for zombies to come after her.  I think I better description would be ghosts since the beings are not material in any way and only she can see them.  Since this is an older movie, the special effects are minimal.  However, the filmmaker did well with what he had.<br />Because it is an older movie, the cast seems to really be projecting their voices to ensure they are heard.  This gives the movie the feel of being just a movie.  At no time will you feel like your are part of the action.<br />But the film is not bad.  If you are a fan of old horror films, then this would be an interesting film.  This is a story you can tell around a campfire.  For the average viewer, you may want to give this a skip.
B00005JKZT|5.0|A masterpiece of cinema storytelling.  The world has NEVER seen anything like The Two Towers.  Told in three different tales, The Two Towers may at first confuse you, but you should and will WANT to see it a second time.  It's far better on the second viewing, and you'll always catch things you never caught before.<br />Gollum, being a completely CG character, will earn your pity and utter distaste.  While Jar Jar may have hurt Star Wars forever, Gollum is unbelievable emotionally and visually.<br />But above all, you will be sucked to the back of your seat for the climactic Battle at Helm's Deep.  But a little bit of advice: See Fellowship of the Ring first, otherwise you will be lost for there is NO recap of the first chapter.<br />Forget what you thought was impossible about Lord of the Rings and put your money to good use.
1563898586|5.0|After reading the introduction, to the first Hellboy graphic novel, by Alan Moore, I was well prepared for this tremendous piece.  This is fiction, but woven throughout are allusions to English literature and culture.  Knowing these allusions clearly adds to the experience of the book.  <br />Some of the key characters of many Victorian adventure stories are gathered together to protect England from her enemies.  This first volume covers the gathering of its members and the first mission.<br />To get all the allusions, pay close attention to everything on the page.  References, names, and even background images in the pages have information for you to help set the tone.<br />This graphic novel includes a short story with Allan Quartermain in the end.  Although a good story, really good if you know your Lovecraft and remember John Carter of Mars, I believe it was originally done in serial.  Whenever you have a serial, there is some repetition to get everyone up to speed, kind of a \\"Last week on ....\\"  Since everything is together here, the repetition can be a little distracting.  It is an interesting story though.<br />I would highly recommend reading this.  I have been away from the comics scene, and this was a fabulous re-introduction into the genre.

But a little bit of advice: See Fellowship of the Ring first, otherwise you will be lost for there is NO recap of the first chapter.<br />Forget what you thought was impossible about Lord of the Rings and put your money to good use.
055357342X|2.0|The Red Wedding. I know that I've never read anything more upsetting in my life. I'm not one to shun realism or bad things happening in books, but there is a fine line to walk, and here George Martin crosses that line. We must all remember that the main purpose of reading fiction is for ENJOYMENT, and really, what is left to enjoy after the Red Wedding?  It seems that in ASoS Martin is more inclined to showing us the gritty realities of medieval times than writing something enjoyable, and to me that's not fiction, that's a documentary. There are other authors -like Terry Goodkind, Robin Hobb, and Tad Williams- who manage to lace their books with enough realism and pain WITHOUT GOING TO EXCESS. In those books, when something bad happens, you of course grieve and fill bad for a little while, but then you move on, and what's more, it makes the book more enjoyable, not less. Not so with this book. I actually had to stop and read another book before I could finish this one. To me that's not good fiction, because good fiction is supposed to HOOK you and not let go. Fiction is, after all, supposed to be fiction. This is, after all, supposed to be fantasy. It's not supposed to be completely real. <br />I loved the first two books and would hate to not know what eventually happens to all these characters I've come to love, but I don't think I could suffer another Red Wedding. George Martin has told me that he doesn't know if anything he writes will be that painful again, so I guess I'll just have to wait and see.
B000022TSH|5.0|The others who review or will review this film will cover most everything, so there isn't much left to say but to repeat (or pre-repeat \\"huh?\\") that it's a great film.   Jack is right up there with Bogart, Powell, Mitchum or any other actor or actress who ever played a gumshoe.   The cast is great, the production is great, the music is great. This might have been the best film to be seen from director Roman Polanski and it might have been one of the best scripts from writer Robert Towne. (It has been said that this is part one of his trilogy. Well we've seen one which was great, two which was boring, will we ever see three?)   Chinatown has one of the best musical scores for film ever. That score by Jerry Goldsmith, dare I say it, runs neck and neck with the much exalted score for Lawrence of Arabia by Maurice Jarre. Chinatown's score like the one for Lawrence has precisely the right notes and precisely the right feel at precisely the right time. Often, enough one can say that a good score is understated and just there below the surface of the action, well this one goes hand in hand with the screen action yet doesn't get in the way at all. The prepared piano sounds are at once novel and intriguing. The harmonics played by the strings are just what are called for.   But sort of on the down side is some of the editing which at times can be really nasty. There are also some wooden deliveries but right after you encounter something like that you get to see a great scene from classic film, so you really can't lose!   So I guess all in all the word for it still has to be GREAT!
0064471837|4.0|Sabriel was one of the most imaginative books I have ever read.  There were so many new concepts it made my head spin and it was so spooky and gripping that I had to read the last hundred or so pages all at once.<br />Sabriel is a college girl who has a very unusual father; his job is to control and get rid of dead things that invade the world of the living.  But when Sabriel finds out her father is in serious trouble, she has to go on a long journey to rescue him.  At the same time, she has to adopt her father's responsibilities and is constantly evading or fighting dead things throughout the story.<br />One thing I really liked about this book was the descriptive work.  Just about anything that wasn't alive, the author was VERY in-depth about describing, and it made my spine tingle to imagine these horrible creatures.  There were a few slow parts and the climax and the very end were not what I expected, but in retrospect this book was definitely, unquestionably worth my time.  HOWEVER, the book's two sequels which I have also read are very BORING. Lirael was awful, Abhorsen was a little better, but Sabriel was a billion times better than both.  Anyone interested, I advise you to just read this book and stop there.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I bought this CD two days ago and have listened to it all the way through at least six or seven times. It's absolutely incredible. It takes the best things from the last three albums and makes them even better. Once again, the White Stripes combine innocence, anger, and humor in a beautiful, brilliant set of songs. The guitar work on \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" especially should silence those who call Jack White talentless []. The album is a perfect balance between rockers like the distorted, broken \\"Black Math\\" and beatiful acoustic melodies like \\"You've Got Her in Your Pocket.\\" \\"Hypnotize\\" is pure garage rock, and surpasses most songs by bands such as The Hives and The Vines. To sum it up: buy this CD. It's good.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This was one of the best tv show musical episodes I have ever seen. All the songs are here, and also some background music from other Buffy shows, the Hush song was recognizable. They cut out the dialogue in some of the songs for this recording, but that leaves part of the song out in some cases. And they added some funny guitar sounds in place of times during the episode where sound effects were used. You get used to it though.
B00008H2LB|4.0|It's strange that Linkin Park is as easy to hate as it is to like.  \\"They are *too* radio-friendly.\\", \\"They are too canned and pre-packaged.\\", \\"They are not true to themselves.\\", \\"They did not develop enough.\\", \\"They rely on a formula too often.\\" And, apparently, *too* many people like it.  <insert sarcasm> And if the establishment likes it, the music can't possibly be good now, can it?   <br />And, truthfully, they may be formulaic, their subject matter may be petty (but then, what isn't? Death / War / Depression / Love / Hate / Anger, it's *all* been done before, rap or rock or metal or pop or ska or *anything*, really), and their lyrics are not especially deep, and really it's pretty much like every old story, rehashed.  <br />But, oh, the storytelling.  Because the lyrics were never meant to stand alone, and the role of songs, taken in their entirety, is to connect with the listener.<br />This is where Linkin Park excels, now in Meteora where it was Hybrid Theory in the past, in finding a hook, a scream, a line, an emotion, a melody, a bit of hip-hop and a dash of rock, a mix of just enough things to be able to transmit a feeling to most everybody.  And even if I recognize the formula they're using, even if I recognize chords recycled from past great artists and I recognize techniques they're reusing from their past albums and even if I cringe a bit at its repetitive points (which got it a 4 instead of a 5), I can still find merit in the music, I can still *feel* the music, however unwittingly, and I still can't help loving it.
B00008H2LB|4.0|well the first time i heard it the only song i liked was lying form you , but after listeining to ti 2 more times , i m addicted to it now , althogh i wanr u this is thousand time better than reanimation and almost upto the hybrid level<br />it gets repeated although ,s songs build up the same way , he sings , chorus , sings again ,chorus ,shouting but then WHO\\"S complaining :-D<br />i seriosuly recommend it to ever1 , for all genre ppl ,atleast give it a shot
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is an awesome new band.  when i first heard that the members of rage against the machine with chris cornell as a singer i thought to myself &quot;this is going to be good&quot;.  When i got it i was amazed at how awesome it was. every track is solid. some tracks have a guitar line that sound like RATM but hey what's wrong with that? They can give u hard rocking tracks and also some slower ones.  Highlights are &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;What you are&quot;, &quot;I am the Highway&quot;,&quot; Show me how to live&quot;, and &quot;Bring Em Back Alive&quot;. Here's my rundown of the tracks&quot;:<br />1. Cochise: Their first single, really defines who they are. my 3rd fav...gotta love this song! <BR>2. Show Me How To Live: my favorite track, chris's voice is awesome on the chorus.<BR>3. Gasonline: another great track<BR>4. What you are: awesome track. i'd say my 4th fav on the cd.  Great lyrics with a lot of meaning.<BR>5. Like a Stone: their 2nd single. one of the slower songs on the cd.<BR>6. Set it off: the guitar sounds a bit like RATM on this track.  <BR>7. Shadow of the sun: another excellent track...(there is not one bad track on this cd!)<BR>8. I am the highway: my 2nd favorite. this is a great song. another slower one. deep meaning in the chorus when he sings &quot;i am not your rolling wheels, i am the highway...i am not your carpet ride, i am the sky&quot; i interpret this as him saying &quot;i will not take you, but i will show you the way.&quot;<BR>9. Exploder: good track<BR>10. Hypnotize: a really good one. sounds a little like something soundgarden would do. a little different than the rest of the cd.<BR>11. Bring Em Back Alive: I LOVE THIS TRACK. <BR>12. Light My Way: another one that sounds a little like RATM in the beginning.  awesome, expecially when he screams &quot;Won't you light my way&quot;<BR>13. Getaway Car: another slower track. <BR>14. The Last Remaining Light: good track to end a cd with.<br />That right there is 14 tracks of great music. Best cd in my collection...GET THIS CD...YOU WON'T REGRET IT!

B00008DDSC|5.0|I will willingly watch any movie of any kind, and go along with the story so long as it keeps me under its spell.  Which is exactly what this movie did for me.  It's my new favorite movie.<br />\\"Secretary\\" is funny (in it's own strange way) and absolutely mesmerizing.  If you can get past the fact that every character in this movie is bizarre and just go with it, you will love it. It's been awhile since a movie has made me this happy.  I've been watching far too many depressing and unoriginal movies that left me feeling like the future of my attending a movie screening bleak.<br />Lee has just been released from an institution, and it's the day of her sister's wedding.  Early on, she is very odd and you wonder what the heck is going on.  She's cutting herself, and her father is an alcoholic.  Life is not very happy for our dear odd bird, Lee.  Then she applies for her first job as secretary to E. Edward Grey.  Her existence takes quite a turn once working for Mr. Grey.<br />Mr. Grey is into S&amp;M, and when Lee starts making typos, he gives the bad girl something to remember him by. She loves every minute.  This is what floats their boat, so to speak...If it makes them happy then so be it.<br />Per his request, she stops cutting.  He also tells her what to do all the time, even what to eat for dinner, and she gladly obliges. She does everything he tells her. Underneath her submissiveness, Lee is embarking on a very weird journey into finding herself and falls in love.<br />It has some great dialogue, too. Now when I answer the phones at work, I smile and laugh to myself, and all I can think of is this movie.<br />It's brilliantly acted by all the actors especially Maggie.  Her performance was the best of all actresses in the year 2002 that I had to the distinct pleasure to witness.  She took on the role and truly made it a spectacle to see.  It was like watching a caterpillar turn into a butterfly.  I thought that she and James Spader had an amazing chemistry together.<br />I say to each is own, some of us appreciate films that push the buttons of others.  This film is worth watching.<br />Also, I am a Secretary myself, and couldn't help but laugh at a lot of the scenes between Lee and Mr. Grey.  I've worked for some real strange men, but no one was quite like E. Edward. This movie should be shown on Sundance on April 23rd, to pay homage to all secretaries like me..  <BR>I say to each is own, some of us appreciate films that push the buttons of others.

B00000DC10|5.0|This is probably the best hardcore album ever made. the songs fit together so well, its like the cd is telling a story. the mixing is flawless, the vocals great, and it involves a vareity of different instruments. go get it!
B000002HMH|5.0|I have been listening to Metallica for along time and there isn't a cd they have made that I dont like.  Metallica may not be as heavy as they used to be but they are a lot more talented as far as the musician aspects.  I play guitar a lot and the newer metallica gives me a lot bigger challenge than the older metallica.  I think you can understand this album more if you are musician.  They wrote heavy and fast music in their younger years because that was probably the extent of their playing ability, but now you can hear how much they have progressed.  Now I am not saying Heavy and fast is not good, I love heavy music, my favorite genre of music is death metal, but I also like to hear more work go into songs instead of just trying to play as fast as you can.  Anybody who just started to like Metallica or has listened to metallica for a long time should get this cd.  I think Metallica did a pretty cool thing with their music, we got to hear their heavy side and now we get to hear their more musically talented side.  I will always consider Metallica the gods of metal, I think they have done more with metal and rock than anybody else ever has and probably ever will do.<br />This cd and every other metallica cd should be in your music collection.
B0000033P0|5.0|I remember buying this back in 1971 when it came out.  As a high school musician, I was completely blown away by the twenty-minute title track!  &quot;Tarkus,&quot; along with Yes's &quot;Fragile&quot; which came out the same year, totally rearranged my thinking on what rock music was all about.<br />I also remember getting into deep trouble when I volunteered to be the DJ at a high school dance.  In between spinning The Osmonds and Three Dog Night, I slipped the title track to &quot;Tarkus&quot; on the turntable.  Man, I practically bust a gut laughing at the response!  Talk about disorientation!  Anyway, I always thought the title track was very rhythmic and offered all sorts of dance possibilities... The crowd thought otherwise.
B00008AWOD|5.0|I'd like to preface my remarks by saying that I am a huge Placebo fan.  I went out and bought this album yesterday and have been listening to it ever since.  Of their three previously released albums, I'd say &quot;Without You I'm Nothing&quot; consisted of some really great songs alongside a couple of less great ones, and &quot;Black Market Music&quot; was more consistent, but the best songs there weren't as good as the best ones on WYIN.  I'd say &quot;Sleeping With Ghosts&quot; is more like &quot;Without You&quot; in this regard.  Of the 12 tracks here, I'd say there are really only two songs that I'm not wild about-&quot;Something Rotten&quot; and &quot;Protect Me From What I Want.&quot;  The rest are great.<br />As for the sound of the album itself, I think this record shows Placebo starting to move away from the largely punk-influenced songs they've had a lot of in the past (i.e. Brick S---house, Days Before You Came, etc.) and more towards more ethereal, beautiful ballad-type songs (i.e. Ask For Answers, Peeping Tom) although there are examples of both here.  I have noticed a lot more synthesizers and electronic noise on this album than on anything else Placebo has recorded in the past, but, unlike a lot of artists who do this, I think the addition of synthesizers help, rather than hinder, the music.<br />My favorite tracks:  English Summer Rain, This Picture, Sleeping With Ghosts, The Bitter End, Special Needs, Second Sight, and Centrefolds.  There is a lot here for Placebo's current fans to like, and a lot more that should hopefully attract some new fans to the fold.  This is a brilliant band that seems to only get better with age.  I can't wait to see what comes next.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I loved this movie.  All things British interest me, so this was especially fun. It was fun to see that things are not so different above the stairs and below the stairs.  Great fun.  You do have to lilsten closely to understand the heavy British accents, but worth the trouble.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I'm writing this after having seen Spirited Away for the second time.  It is simply a wonderful movie.  For the moviegoing viewers that get their dose of anime from Dragonball Z, this movie may be disappointing.  There are no transforming robots, no busty, big-eyed heroines, or letcherous schoolboys being hit with giant hyperdimensional hammers.  For parents looking for something to take their kids to, this movie requires a little consideration.  I've heard many parents complain that it's too scary for their kids.  Indeed, it may be a bit visually dynamic for your average preschooler, but it's no worse than the kind of stuff you're letting them watch in Ren & Stimpy or the aforementioned Dragonball Z.  I've seen more parents buying kids the 8-Mile DVD than taking their kids to see Spirited Away.  Bear in mind that PG is not the new G.  PG still implies there are things in the movie that may require parental guidance.  Parents should keep in mind that animation is viewed as an art form in Japan, and that not all animated movies are kiddie fodder such as Disney fare and Pokemon.  On the whole, I would say Spirited Away is no scarier than Disney's early Snow White, or their adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.  This, however, definitely is not Bambi.<br />Many folks may also be put off by the talk of Spirited Away being a \\"weird\\" movie.  IMO, Spirited Away is kind of a Japanese version of Alice in Wonderland.  I won't go into the details of the movie, which you can easily find other places online.  One must keep in mind that this is a **Japanese** film, and what is weird to Western moviegoers is not so to Eastern viewers.  The film draws heavily on its Japanese roots, incorporating storytelling elements from Japanese literature, theatre, folklore, and even Shinto and Buddhist elements.<br />Visually, the movie is a feast for the eyes.  Even if you don't care much for the story, the backgrounds are breathtaking.  This is not a cartoon that is cranked out for the purpose of merchandising, but an animated feast that is lovingly crafted to convey a story.  To say this movie is a mere cartoon is like saying the original Mona Lisa is a suitable placemat for a TV tray.<br />Spirited Away is a breath of fresh air among animated movies that are little more than FX extravaganzas.  It is a movie that tells a story about the power of the human heart to prevail in even the most inhuman of situations.  Conflicts are not resolved with swords and scorcery, but with compassion and insight.  This is a movie that demonstrates that the knowledge of who you are as a person is more valuable than mad kung-fu skills or \\"catching them all.\\"<br />To sum up, Spirited Away is, as I have come to refer to it, an \\"animated hiaku.\\"
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is a big improvement over the VHS set!  The old clips look great, sometimes startlingly so.  (Just check out the videos for &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; or &quot;Hey Jude&quot;).  The sound is a relelation -- they've done 5 channel re-mixes on the songs and they're excellent.  &quot;Something&quot; is especially nice.  I really enjoy being able to jump to a favorite song, though some searching is involved -- they're not all listed in the menu. In fact, hearing this DVD really makes me want to have Abbey Road, or Sgt. Pepper released in 5-channel audio.<br />  The extra disc is a nice bonus -- lots of informal chatter from the guys. Seeing Paul, George and Ringo enjoying each other's company did my heart good.  After all those years of lawsuits and backbiting it was to good to see their friendship intact.  (It sure made me miss George and John, though).  Go get it, Beatle fans.  It's great, and the whole thing is substantially cheaper than the original set!  An excellent value.
0676973779|5.0|One of the most exhilirating books I've ever read in my life!  Yann Martel outlines courage, hope, survival in the most unique way possible.  Who would have ever thought surviving on a boat with a bunch of animals? A journey taking almost an year, a journey where at times one would feel hopeless, a journey endangered by a Bengal Tiger, a journey for all journeys.  <br />Survival is vital, not in shipwrecks, but in day to day life.  This is not only a book, but it teaches one to believe and trust in God that one day he/she will be saved.  And that courage, determination and understanding does not come with age, but with the will of an individual to rise above obstacles that appear in life.  This is more than just a book, this is life.  And if we all can apply this to our daily lives, our obstacles just become a reflection of our solutions.  <br />Twisted with the three beliefs- Christianity, Mulsim, Hinduism - protrays an individual who is on a quest to gain knowledge and wisdom.  The strength he endures through this epic journey is unimaginable.  This strength is the strength we all need to get our own 5 stars in life.<br />Thank you Yann Martel, for you are the saint of all writers that changed the minds of those who seek for wisdom!
B00005JL95|2.0|Lilo and Stitch is based on a little girl that just needs a friend. I think That Lilo is a little brat because she just dismissed Stitch just because he did something bad and she didn't even give him a second chance.I do not not recomend this movie to little kids.If you don't like depresing movies you shouldn't see this movies.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Ok-- I've noticed some comments here about it being hard to follow the many, many soldiers throughout the series, thus making it hard to &quot;connect&quot; with any of them. <br />My family and I watched this together-- one to two episodes a night until we were done. We were very methodical and enjoyed the experience more because we were able to follow all of the different names that get thrown at you. Here's how I did it:<br />1. Watch the Last Disc (Disc. #6) FIRST. At the very least-- watch the documentary of the survivors detailing their experiences in their own words. Now, some purists may argue this with me, saying that it &quot;spoils&quot; the series-- you may remember someone in the documentary and therefore know they live, but I don't think it's that big of a deal and it helps you understand the characters more.<br />2. BEFORE EVERY EPISODE-- Go to the episode you're going to watch and the go to the different features. Read the vocab they provide, then take a GOOD look at the maps, and then-- go to the section that gives you a run-down of the characters. It changes with every episode to let you know who is going to be featured in that particular one, and gives you some background on the character--what they did before the joined the army, etc. etc.<br />This DVD package really pushes the limits of the medium. UTILIZE the DVD!! Trust me, these two steps will make this DVD one of your prized possessions.
0671510991|5.0|Kissinger's Diplomacy sets two themes. First Kissinger describes how the modern nation state emerged from the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, where nations (at the time only European) agreed to stay out of each other's internal affairs; he continues with an excellent, though obviously partisan, history of Europe's great diplomats, from Richelieu to Bismark. He segues from 19th century European to 20th century American diplomacy, concentrating on Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and of course Richard Nixon and himself. Following through, he brings to center stage his second theme: motives. Why do countries do what they do, and in particular why America does what it does. <br />The treaty of Westphalia set the stage for all modern history, up to an including what goes on today. When Russia tells other nations to stay out of Chechnya, it invokes the principles of domestic sovereignty as laid out by Westphalia. When China claims other nations have no say in how it treats dissidents, it again implicitly invokes Westphalia. <br />Kissinger takes his history of diplomacy from Richelieu to Bismarck, always stressing how practical these men were, and how successful diplomats always put necessity ahead of principles.  Realpolitk rules. But what of America? Kissinger presents 20th century foreign policy as a conflict. On one side we find European style diplomacy ruled by principles of geopolitical self-interest; on the other side we find democracy and idealism. Kissinger himself is at a loss. <br />He obviously follows the European school, and doesnft really understand the American school, but he understands this limitation. Among American presidents, he admires Theodore Roosevelt and Nixon most for their grasp of European-style foreign policy, but strangely it is Ronald Reagan whom he lionizes as some sort of diplomatic genius. Kissinger does not consider Reagan intelligent, but he sees that Reagan won the cold war against the Soviets by diplomatic means, with no direct confrontation. And he doesnft really understand how it was done. Nevertheless, Kissinger still makes a strong case for adopting geopolitical interests as the central value in establish American foreign policy. <br />For this reason, it remains a topical and important book. Americans are very uncomfortable with going to war for national interests. Now, at the start of the Iraq war, even its supporters squirm when they hear opposing slogans like &quot;No Blood for Oil&quot;. Americans prefer standing on principles such as bringing democracy and foiling dictatorships. Kissinger argues this view is misguided, usually, and that it is right for nations to fight simply for their own interests, especially where security is concerned.
B00005CDNK|5.0|I agree with just about all of the well-articulated reviewers who recognize this album's depth and maturity. Benny's sense of melody is just as strong as ever here, and Bjorn's lyrics are very well written and meaningful. Agnetha does a great job with her tracks, especially with the aching sense of loneliness in &quot;One Of Us&quot; and the helpless observations in &quot;Slipping Through My Fingers,&quot; about a parent watching her child grow up too fast and wondering where all the time has gone. But I really love Frida's work in this collection. Her spirited delivery in &quot;When All Is Said And Done&quot; is an uplifting high point on the album, and her incredible performance on the title track &quot;The Visitors&quot; is absolutely haunting. Benny's electronic orchestrations on this song are brilliant, and the way Frida expresses the paranoia of &quot;waiting for these visitors&quot; could not be better. Interestingly enough, her one solo hit in the U.S., &quot;I Know There's Something Going On,&quot; was also laced with a strong sense of paranoia. Highly recommended.

When China claims other nations have no say in how it treats dissidents, it again implicitly invokes Westphalia.<br />Kissinger takes his history of diplomacy from Richelieu to Bismarck, always stressing how practical these men were, and how successful diplomats always put necessity ahead of principles.  Realpolitk rules. But what of America? Kissinger presents 20th century foreign policy as a conflict. On one side he gives is Theodore Roosevelt and European style diplomacy ruled by principles of geopolitical self-interest; on the other side he presents Woodrow Wilson championing democracy and idealism. Kissinger himself is at a loss. He obviously admires both men but feels kinship only with Rooselvelt.<br />Kissinger follows the European school, doesn't really understand the American school, but he understands himself there and his limitations. Among American presidents, he admires Theodore Roosevelt and Nixon most for their grasp of European-style foreign policy, yet strangely it is Ronald Reagan whom he lionizes as some sort of diplomatic genius. Kissinger does not consider Reagan intelligent, but he sees that Reagan won the cold war against the Soviets by diplomatic means, with no direct confrontation between the USSR and the USA. And he doesn't really understand how it was done.<br />Nevertheless, Kissinger makes a strong case for adopting geopolitical interests as the central value in establish American foreign policy. For this reason, it remains a topical and important book. Americans are very uncomfortable with going to war for national interests.<br />Now, at the start of the Iraq war, even its supporters squirm when they hear opposing slogans like &quot;No Blood for Oil&quot;. Americans prefer standing on principles such as bringing democracy and foiling dictatorships. Kissinger argues this view is misguided, usually, and that it is right for nations to fight simply for their own interests, especially where security is concerned.s not consider Reagan intelligent, but he sees that Reagan won the cold war against the Soviets by diplomatic means, with no direct confrontation between the USSR and the USA.

0385504209|5.0|This book was a page turner from moment one.  It is filled with so many factual, and interesting information that it really gets you thinking.  I had to look up the painting of the first supper and really look at it.  I was so impressed with this book and its fast-paced, keep you guessing edge that I'm going back to buy his other books!
B00006GA4C|5.0|I put this album right alongside &quot;Disreali Gears&quot; and &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;.  A tight, unified sound from start to finish - never mind that there weren't any radio hits on it.  At that time and place, radio hits were beside the point.  The music was rapidly evolving, and the power-trio format was the cutting edge of that evolution. Not as frenetic and competitive as Cream, and with a MUCH better rhythm section than the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Grand Funk Railroad was at the top of their game on this one!  Led Zeppelin would take the power-trio format, add a great lead singer, and dominate the sound of the next decade.  If you're into power-trios, you should DEFINITELY have this album.  If you want to hear the very SOUL of Grand Funk Railroad, buy this one FIRST!  You can pick up the &quot;hits&quot; any time, but this one is a jewel from start to finish!
014028009X|3.0|It was definately better than the movie, but I felt the book left something to be desired.  I felt sympathy for the character and the things she was going through in her life, but really didn't get into the story until the end.  That just seems a little long to me to wait for a story to pull you in.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie made a huge return to the charts with 2000's &quot;LIGHT YEARS&quot;. That record would release the now classic dance single &quot;Spinning Around&quot; among other memorable hits. It's now a year later and with &quot;LIGHT YEARS&quot; selling about 5 million units world-wide, Kylie reinvents her sound and image for &quot;FEVER&quot;. The stand-out tracks include, &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Love Affair&quot;, &quot;Burning Up&quot;, the fabulous &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; and it's cousin &quot;Come Into My World&quot;. If you think about the single choices the songs tell a story of club love. Kylie &quot;Can't Get Him Out of Her Head&quot;, because it's &quot;In His Eyes&quot;, and she knew it was &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;, so she wants him to &quot;Come Into Her World&quot;. This is one of the best Dance-Pop records in the last 2 to 3 years. &quot;FEVER&quot; is Kylie's best truly Dance record since her 1990 classic album &quot;RHYTHM OF LOVE&quot;. Kylie progresses yet again with her sound and image going into more Electro-Funk. I'm sure one the reason most of the songs released from the album were monster hits is because of their great videos. &quot;FEVER&quot; appeals to anyone who loves to dance and have a good time. I also recomend 2000's &quot;LIGHT YEARS&quot;, and 1997's &quot;IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS&quot;.<BR>For newer fans, it would also be wise to check out Kylie's new 2002 Greatest Hits collection from her PWL (1987 to 1992) years, along with 2000's &quot;HITS +&quot; that summarize Kylie's DeConstruction period (1994-1998). &quot;FEVER&quot; has gone on to sell more than 8 million units world-wide. The U.S. has re-embraced Kylie and her music. I think this time around it's us who &quot;Should Be So Lucky...Lucky...Lucky&quot; to have her back.
B00005CDNI|5.0|I think that's the right translation of &quot;Voulez-Vous.&quot; In any case, I was surprised to find a couple of reviewers bashing &quot;Chiquitita.&quot; I admit it was not my favorite ABBA song way back when, but since then I've come to regard it as their masterpiece of 1979. The sad, sympathetic verses and uplifting, anthemic choruses make this a song with great depth and feeling. Bjorn's mature lyrics, Agnetha's moving lead vocal and Benny's almost barrelhouse piano outro make this song one that can't be overlooked as one of ABBA's great achievements. Other than that, I pretty much agree with the other reviewers points.
0048231797|5.0|UNFISHED TALES OF NUMENOR AND MIDDLE-EARTH is a collection of stories by JRR Tolkien. The book is divided into four parts: the first part is titled \\"The First Age\\" and the stories that are in it are \\"Of Tour and his Coming to Gondolin\\" and \\"Narn I Hin Hurin\\" which is the story of Turin. So, Part One is about the two cousins. Part Two is named \\"The Second Age\\" and contains \\"Descriptions of the Island of Numenor\\", \\"Aldarion and Erendis\\", The Line of Elros: Kings of Numenor\\", and The History of Galadriel and Celeborn and Amroth King of Lorien\\". Part three, which of course is named \\"The Third Age\\" and has \\"The Disaster of the Gladden Fields\\", Cirion adn Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan\\", \\"The Quest of Erebor\\", The Hunt for the Ring\\", and \\"The Battle of the Fords of Isen\\". Part Four is, no, not named \\"The Fourth Age\\" but instead, just simply \\"Part Four\\". Part Four is for background reading and information with \\"The Druedain\\", \\"The Istari\\", and \\"The Palantiri\\". <br />But as good as the book is by itself, I would sugest you read \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\" before reading UNFINISHED TALES OF HUNEMOR AND MIDDLE-EARTH. maybe you should even read \\"The Simarillion\\" before it, even though I'm sure you will understand the contents without reading \\"The Simarillion\\". <br />There are many stories and characters in this book, so it's hard to have a favorite character. But one of the best things about the book is the fact that JRR Tolkien paints the pictures so vividly in your mind. You can imagine the sea, the forests, and the people when you read it.<br />If this book could have been improved, then many of the important and best parts would be lost and gone. The only warning that I give is that, unlike \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\", UNFINISHED TALES is written in a text-book, bible sort of way. For people who hate to read this kind of writing, I suggest that you read the first few stories and then see if you like it or not. <br />I would reccommend this book to readers of JRR Tolkien(Duh!), C.S. Lewis, Brian Jacques, or any other fantasy reader. I'm sure that this book will intrest historians and geographers, too. The fantasy world of Middle Earth is so full of suprises and wonders that you're never sure if you'll like it or not- but I'm sure you will.
B000001FOS|4.0|With the exception of &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot;, which sticks out like a sore thumb, as Yngwie's attempt at getting some airplay, this is a well-crafted cd.  Musically, it's not his best disk, but it is very good &amp; worth picking up if you're already a fan of Yngwie.
B00005JLKN|4.0|Red Dragon is definitely a good movie that I would recommend others see.  However, what I found to be completely unnerving about Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lechter in the past is his icey cold civility.  This incarnation of Hannibal has more of an attitude.  FBI agent Will Graham is played by Edward Norton, someone I would have never thought of for this part.  He does a very commendable job. The &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; killer is played compellingly by Ralph Fiennes.  By the end of the movie, my appetite was not satisfied in regard to Anthony Hopkins, one of our living legends of the theatre.  I would therefore rate this film at a four and a half based on the commendable work of others actors and actresses in Red Dragon.  This is still a very decent addition to the collection for Hannibal fans.  Hopefully, the next Hannibal sequel will serve Anthony Hopkins as the main course instead of an appetizer.  Bon Apetite!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Wow.  Wow.  These are just about the only words that will enter your mind after seeing this film.  Jake Gyllenhaal (The Good Girl, October Sky, Lovely and Amazing) plays the title character who has hallucinations of a less-than-normal-looking rabbit.  This rabbit, Frank, tells Donnie to do things for him.  Donnie's already strange life gets a wee bit stranger when an airplane engine crashes through his bedroom, almost killing him.  Add in the characters who are a part of his life: the shrink who helps Donnie (played wonderfully by the great Katharine Ross) and a mysterious new girl Gretchen (Jena Malone), and you have a well-acted, innovative film.  The soundtrack is amazing and poignant, and the film's premise is completely orignal.  Richard Kelly is on his way to becoming one of the most talented screenwriters we have....and this is only his first film!!!!!  Fear, love, death, acceptance, divine intervention, the passing of time, and loneliness are all factors touched upon in this deeply moving film.  Remember: You truly are never alone....even when you die.  And, it just MIGHT be possible that something greater than this universe is out there: protecting us, guiding us, teaching us.  And ultimately, saving us....from our own fears and regrets.
0140177396|4.0|OF Mice and Men was a very good book, i could read it over and over. I have read the book a few time and it gets better every time.  John Steinbeck was very creative to think of the character Lennie, and the troubles he was in.  I also watch the movie and it did give the book some justice.  It was almost the same way I pictured it while reading. In this book you do see the side of someone who is not very smart at all. I enjoyed this book very much and Will more in likely Pick it up again.
B000003N8R|5.0|Almost every artist of stature becomes overly associated with one work, which is often deemed to be their finest or most representative. With 'Trane, the seminal album is supposedly 'A Love Supreme'.<BR>Those listeners who wish to look beyond the critical consensus should make straight for 'Crescent', which immediately precedes 'Supreme' and was perceptively described by a critic as 'the dark night of the soul' before the epiphany of the album that followed. As another reviewer here has pointed out, this is a deeply lyrical work, with a cool, heavy mood that makes it one of the most affecting records in modern jazz.<BR>If you are a listener attuned to moody rock like David Sylvian, John Cale, Nico and similar romantics, 'Crescent' is the 'Trane for you. Leave the admittedely great but over-discussed 'supreme' to the trendies...or at least until you have managed to extricate yourself from the shadowy solitude of this beautiful album.
B000069HKH|5.0|Springsteen places &quot;The Rising&quot; in the marketplace like a shark in the charts, a CD that is about important issues and expresses the most powerful of emotions.  All the songs on the CD are good, some exceptional. My current personal #1 is &quot;My City of Ruins.&quot;  I've been listening to the version from &quot;America: A Tribute to Heroes&quot; which is a bit more raw with its harmonicas, sparse arrangement and transcendent backing voices; however, the version on &quot;The Rising&quot; is a bit smoother, more polished, &amp; has a wonderful build.  I love the pop sound of &quot;Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)&quot; which is like a welcome respite from heavy emotions.  &quot;Counting On A Miracle&quot; sounds like a happy joyful tune until you focus on the lyric, &quot;Sleeping beauty awakes from her dream with her lover's kiss on her lips; your kiss was taken from me.&quot;  &quot;Paradise&quot; is wonderfully haunting.  With the slight exception of &quot;Mary's Place,&quot; all these songs work exceptionally well for me.  Bruce has risen to the occasion of trying to express in music the deep well of emotions surrounding September 11.  Because tribulation is unfortunately not a one-time experience, the music is universal in theme &amp; powerful with its reach.  May this shark forever swim.  Enjoy!
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie is simply wonderful , Fosse would be so proud to see his wonderful musical turned into such a great film , Kudos go to the cast for making it happen.
B00005JLKN|3.0|It kills me that most of the posters for this movie sport a huge picture of Hannibal on them,he was only in the book a few pages and now in the movie he is the main character?Also Francis Dollarhyde in the book was a physically huge monster of a strong individual.In the movie Palph Finnes plays him .COME ON!!!!!!!<BR>half the book was left out and they made WIll and Hannibal look like friends after they stabbed eachother,it wasnt like that at all!<BR>As a movie it is fine I guess, just dont expect too close of a translation from the GREAT book!
B00005JLK1|2.0|A first rate and well-known actor will occassionally do a bad movie for a little extra cash.  This is the only explanation I can find to justify Gabriel Byrne's performance as the stereotypical old-man-of-the-sea tug boat captian in this less than average horror film.  The plot is as worn and tired as the classic Victorian hunted house with the simple twist of geography.  In lieu of a turn of the century decaying mansion the film is set primarily in a rusty bucket that was once a transatlantic luxury steam liner.  It can be summed up in one sentence.  An ocean salvage boat tries to tow an aparently abandoned mystery ship.  Canned scares ensue.  All the boiler plate cliches of hauntings past are resurrected.  The film builds up to the real gore with a few false positives where the salvage crew members flippantly scare each other and rusty floors give way.  Yawn.  By the time the supernatural beings begin to show themselves the viewer is informed enough of the style and system of the director to see them coming for several minutes.  There is the good ghost trying to warn the tug boat crew as they dither about eerily lit halls and cabins.  A blood filled swimming pool scene that is a direct lift from the Shining's famous elevator scene.  The evil demon whose omnipotence is inexplicabley hit and miss.  Trust me, I could go on and on with the holes in this sinker (pun intended).  All in all though, the film lacks the psychological build up and tension upon which stories about haunted locations thrive.  Consequently, it is forced to make up for this inadequacy with lots of rated P.G. gore accompanied by mechanistic and predicatable \\"scares\\".  After suffering through 90 minutes of this, the last minute plot twist comes across all the more pathetic. About the only good thing that I can say for the film is that its explanatory 1963 flash back scenes of how the passengers and crew died made me long for a chance to travel back in time four or five decades and dance to the sexyvoice of a bucksome Italian chanteuse on the deck of an ocean liner in a swank tux (minus the decaptitation).
0060523794|3.0|Pretty good book, at least the 1st half.  The second half was pretty boring.
6305736650|5.0|The character played by Bogart in this film is absolutely larger than life.  Most men can love a woman.  But how many men can actually let go of a woman he love, in the interest of greater good for humanity?
0385504209|5.0|Brown's narrative style is like great chocolate: rich, seductive, and seriously addictive. I read this one in a single day, and look forward to reading it again! I absolutely love Grail fiction, so finding this novel was like finding...well, you get the idea. The ideas may not be totally new, but they are presented in a gripping and fascinating manner. I'm sure that there will be knee-jerk reactions from many Catholics, but even though I am a Christian I found Brown's ideas about the role of political manipulation in the history of the Church to be intriguing food for thought. Here's to thinking outside the box!
B00005YJMX|5.0|Beautiful, hypnotic, and haunting telling of the vampire legend...Probably better than most &quot;DRACULA&quot; movies...musical score throughout the picture will compel you to watch what is truly a visual treat...Highly recommended to any horror movie fan, or those just interested in vampire lore.
B00008MNYS|5.0|...so I'm a little biased.  I think he could release a cd of nothing but himself reading the telephone book and I'd give it 5 stars.  <br />That said, this is a fantastic album.  Anyone who is unfamiliar with Robbie might not understand some of the context of \\"Handsome Man\\" or \\"Come Undone,\\" but you have to appreciate the honesty he pours into his lyrics.  And I'd say EVERYONE at some time or another can relate to the sentiments in \\"Love Somebody\\" and \\"Feel.\\" <br />Escapology has a different sound from Robbie's previous albums, and anyone expecting another \\"Millenium\\" will be surprised.  The production is a lot less dense, and while there's still some clever & sarcastic humor, these songs have a far more grown-up viewpoint.  Heck, there's even some swearing on this one, which is funny in some ways because I've always wondered how this incredibly foul-mouthed guy could keep his lyrics so clean.<br />I've been a Robbie Williams fan for years now, and it's my goal to force everyone I know to listen to his music.  Not only is he the sexiest man in entertainment (Hell-ooo, 'Rock DJ' video!) but he also writes or co-writes all of his own music.  Those qualities, combined with his fanatstic sense of humor and truly beautiful voice make our American pop stars just look pathetic.<br />I love this album, but I'd actually recommend getting the European version.  \\"Hot Fudge\\" is one one the best sing-along-at-the-top-of-your-lungs-while-driving songs ever recorded, but it was left off the American album because the lyrics are all about moving to Los Angelos, and I suppose that would have been viewed as trying too hard to appeal to this side of the pond.  The other discarded songs are great, too.  Then again, I'm the one waiting for that telephone book album, so don't take my word for it...
B00008J4P5|1.0|i tried to like this band. i know, a lot of people say how amazing they are, hyping this &quot;garage rock&quot; thing. i bought white blood cells, listened several times, just couldn't bring myself to enjoy it. while i love rougher-sounding bands like nirvana, the stooges, led zeppelin, the buzzocks, i don't find anything really appealing about the white stripes' music, or anything that makes it unique from anyone else's. they just seem to have spin/mtv hype like all the rest of these so called &quot;garage bands.&quot; i tried again to understand the fuss, and bought the &quot;elephant&quot; album a couple of days ago, not expecting much. well, i didn't get much. a lot of their music sounds the same, very course, and while there is some nice guitar work i just can't get into it. i wouldn't recommend them to anyone actually, because i just don't think they're any good. sorry if you disagree, but that's my two cents.
B000002G7G|5.0|The VU's self-titled album was so laid back and folky compared to their intense prior albums, the Banana Album and White Light/White Heat. Credit this difference to bassist Doug Yule, whose jangly, almost poppy rhythms bear no resemblance to John Cale's uniquely cutting viola work. Yule's inclusion brings out a less subversive side to the band that had been hinted at with the inverted pop of There She Goes or Sunday Morning from the Banana Album. However, the self-titled album is still very VU in its own arty way, unlike Loaded which was ruined by commercial expectations.<br /><br />Without Nico or Cale hogging the limelight, Lou Reed comes to the fore here, with his sneer being tempered by an understated emotional edge--after the dissonant anarchy that was White Light/White Heat, Lou seems to be at peace with himself. Pale Blue Eyes, Beginning To See The Light, and I'm Set Free reflect this new sensibility. Sterling Morrison's guitar work is as brilliant as ever, and Doug Yule rounds out the band nicely. However, the real standout is drummer Moe Tucker, with both her minimalist percussion and innocuous, charming vocals on the moving After Hours.<br /><br />No real VU album is complete without at least one avant-garde foray, and here resides the unique Murder Mystery. Unlike the noisy European Son and Sister Ray this one is actually rather subdued (though very weird) as Reed and Tucker engage in call-and-answer vocal performances that add an unsettled feeling to the piece.<br /><br />Altogether this album is without a single weak moment, and is a great place to start your education in the VU. A highly recommended classic.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Linkin Park burst onto the Music Scene in 2000 with their Multi-platinum-selling debut album Hybrid Theory. Unfortunately, their follow-up CD, Meteora, is not nearly as good. While they maintain their blend of hard rock and rap that propelled Hybrid Theory to the top of the charts, these two key elements are often juxtaposed awkwardly on Meteora, resulting in a CD that is barely above average.<br />The biggest difference between Hybrid Theory and Meteora is that instead of hip-hop/rap elements providing a sturdy framework for the heavy rock tunes synonymous with Linkin Park to go off on screaming solos (as on Hybrid Theory), the roles are reversed on Meteora; rap and hip-hop take precedence over fairly standard guitar riffs. However, Hybrid Theory is an extremely high standard for any band to meet and Meteora must be judged on its own merits. So what exactly keeps Meteora from reaching the astronomical heights of its predecessor? Primarily responsible is the fact that there is simply too much sampling- many of the songs sound as though they were cobbled together from several separate shorter pieces and stitched together with a psuedo-hardcore chorus or vanilla rapping. This disrupts the flow of emotion the band tries to establish with lyrics that never reach their full potential on all but a few songs. These factors combine to give the listener the impression that the vast majority of the tracks are either rough-drafts or have been synthetically manufactured on computers.<br />Far and away, the best track on the disc is the smooth, solid, and driving Somewhere I Belong. Other highlights are the introspective Breaking the Habit and Nobody's Listening, an oddly catchy blend of aggressive rap and screaming guitar riffs that work well enough with the rest of the song to stop short of being annoying. I caught myself subconsciously humming these tunes countless times since buying the CD. On the other hand, there are several mundane and homogenous songs with lyrics that all work in the same vein and indistinguishable heavy guitar bashing. Furthermore, on these tracks the lyrics fail to work in conjunction with the music to communicate an emotion or tone for the song; the lyrics are no more than bland filler. A perfect example of this is Easier To Run, a song that incorporates all of Meteora's shortcomings.<br />Overall, this album has many strong points which are regrettably overshadowed by its faults. And while I don't regret buying this CD, many fans certainly will be disappointed.
B000066NW0|3.0|I absolutely despie the song \\"Ska8er Boi\\". It's soo annoying and gets stuck in your head.  But, I heard her other song \\"Losing Grip\\" on MTV the other day and was kinda interested, D/L a few songs from Kazaa and went and bought the cd.  I think \\"Complicated\\" is an okay song, really like \\"I'm With You\\" and the rest of the cd is good too.  Her voice sounds different in every song and ya gotta admit she does have some vocal talent.  The lyrics are pretty good too.  I really like the song \\"Tomorrow\\".  Overall, I would say it's a good cd, but would be better w/o \\"Ska8er Boi\\"!
1556587864|1.0|Walked into this movie clueless on opening night. Had heard that gay \\"activists\\" had made violent threats to correct the movie's depiction of gays as violent.  I admired two other movies by same director, \\"Spetters\\" and \\"The Fourth Man\\". Movie opened with a spellbinding French-blinds shot that augured great things. Lush, overripe score hinted at mystery, sensuality, danger. When the action began, it was jarring and intense. Then...dialogue and performances.<br />From this point on, zero intelligence or honesty. In place of characterization were cliches, plot contrivances and cheap shock effects. In place of believable interactions, leering innuendo. Scene by scene, line by line, it seemed to have been penned by a fat, outcast 12 year-old, or at best by someone for whom English was a second (or third) language.<br />Guys, catch up: adults do not talk this way to each other. People do not react this way, the real world is not this simplistic and fantasy-friendly. Maybe that's what they meant by the \\"basic\\" part. All I can say is, it was hard to sit through something so cheesy, uninvolving, and crowded with unsympathetic, cardboard retards.<br />Not even any sex appeal, since the two leads had no chemistry. Save your money for \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\".
076790382X|4.0|I'm A Stranger Here Myself reflects the Bryson of latter years seen in &quot;A Walk In The Woods&quot; and &quot;In a Sunburned Country.&quot;  Wry, witty and full of good humour and laugh out loud moments.<br />I enjoyed this collection of his weekly columns very much.  Bryson turned two years worth of weekly observations on American life done for an English periodical into this book.  What informs Brits will delight Americans as Bryson explores American trends, small town life and his personal experiences as the expatriate returned with English bride and children in tow.<br />This collection runs the gamut.  Bryson muses on the wonders of his hometown post office (with an annual customer appreciation day), American statistics pulled from the census (his piece on the number of us injured by our bedding -- sheets, pillows and spreads -- every year is a riot), travel over our vast expanses, his local coffee shop, his very own garden and English gardener (his wife), and very many other et ceteras.<br />This is an eclectic selection.  Although in some places the American reader may find some articles over-explained (one has to keep in mind he was writing for a foreign audience), this is a very well written collection of short essays.<br />The confident Bryson humor is here, as well as his excellent use of language and sentence structure.  Whereas I thought some of Bryson's early works tried for too much humor and sometimes seemed forced as well as overly sarcastic, here the author is content to share interesting thoughts and stories punctuated by yuks.  This writer does have an engaging way with words.  There are laugh-out-loud moments in the book and generally it is a very pleasant light diversion.  Worth the read.
B00008DDXC|5.0|... then mayhap I smell an Oscar on the horizon? Because this sequel was loads better than both the original and Lord of the Rings. Of course, I still have to say: READ THE BOOK(S). Each books significantly improves over the last. Reading the book is like getting the special edition DVD early, something you should not miss out on either.<br />Film wise, \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" stands above its competators for family films (and fantasy films) in several ways. Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have greatly improved since \\"Sorceror's Stone\\", so much so that their acting doesn't fault once. For such fresh actors, they actually managed to add depth to their characters, something Vin Diesel has yet to achieve. The special effects are almost top notch (as disappointed as I was with The Two Towers, Gollum was still both a better character and supurbly animated than Dobby.), although I wish the basilisk has moved a little better.<br />The plot is much darker than the first film, and \\"Chamber\\" is probably the second darkest of the books thus far, with \\"Goblet of Fire\\" easily taking the cake on that one. Columbus mixes drama, humor, and fantasy well enough, but he's still just missed the mark. There are some scene that were actually, I thought, improved upon from the book. Namely, the scene in Hagrid's hut after the \\"mud-blood\\" incident (Emma Watson plays this perfectly and Robby Coltrane has yet to miss a beat in any of his movies) and one of the scenes in the hospital wing (when Ron and Harry pay a visit to a friend).<br />The real problems I can recall lie in Columbus's concentration on the action sequences. The final confrontation seemed to drag on far longer than in the book (and it did, upon re-reading) while Lockhart and Snape, who are played by two of Hollywood's greater actors, get barely any screen time at all. They do, of course, [shine in] every scene they're in. Also, why is it that Quidditch is more fun to read about than it is to watch? And one match just isn't enough. I'd much rather see a few seconds of several matches instead of the obligatory one match. Hopefully, this can be remedied for \\"Azkaban\\".<br />Despite these minor faults, \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" is still an excellent movie. The DVD remains in question. Looking at the specs, it seems outcries from the shoddy first DVD have been heard. Gone is the treasure hunt to unlock the deleted scenes (less than 10 on the first and not worth it at all) every single time. This time, we get 19, cast interviews, the whole nine yards. It looks to be well worth picking up.<br />The Harry Potter series is one of the best fantasy series in print and a decent film adaptation. And, like it or not, it does get kids to read, unlike other fantasy films whose books are dry and boring. So until the Discworld series get greenlit for a live action movie (starring Christopher \\"I'm-80-and-still-scary-beyond-belief\\" Lee as Death), I'll stick with Harry Potter. And to think, I used to think it would be a terrible movie!
B000002KXV|5.0|Donald Fagen is always kneedeep in irony and clever lyrics. Some times they are cruel (Gaslighting Abby) sometimes obscure, (much of Kamakiriad) but he's right on target with Nightfly. There were really two sixties, the 60's before 63 and the 60's after. Most of what we now consider the 60's refers to the late 60's. Pinpointed in 1958-1962, America was a very different place. Happy content, optimistic, Fagen has found all the hingepoints of white suburban naivete just before the whole thing collapses into nighmares of the Kennedy Assasination, VietNam, Race Warfare, drugs etc.<br />IGY (the International Geophysical Year) deals with the quaint idea, said with gentle humor and irony, that Science would solve all the worlds problem's and the golden age was right around the corner, a world of \\"Spandex jackets, one for everyone\\" where we were \\"eternally free and eternally young\\". \\"Just machines to make Big Decisions/ programmed by fellows with compassion and vision\\". People really thought this! \\"A 90 minute trip on the undersea railroad from New York to Paris\\".<br />There is a song about a girl with \\"A touch of Tuesday Weld\\" (the perfect goddess from the \\"Many Loves of Dobbie Gilles\\" & the cover of Matthew Sweet's \\"Girlfriend\\").<br />There is a song about - \\"a little dugout that my Dad built/ in case the Russians try to push the button down\\" - people thought a fallout shelter and a few months of food would protect them from a worldwide nuclear war.<br />There is a spectacular redo of Dion and the Belmonts \\"Ruby Baby\\" with lots of new chords. When Fagen says \\"Ruby, when will you be miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine?\\" the soundstage is 50 feet wide and 50 feet deep.<br />A song about someone maybe in the Batista regime in Cuba who thinks he is about to be be assassinated by Castro-ites.<br />A song about the teen protagonist trying to sweet-talk \\"Maxine\\" into the back seat or the motel.<br />And there's the title song about Lester the Nightfly, the graveyard talk show DJ, fielding calls from bigots about \\"a race of men in the trees\\".<br />A song about the early Kennedy-era optimistic buzzword the \\"New Frontier\\" where America could do no wrong. \\"I know you're mad about Brubeck... he's an artist, a poineer. He's got the right vibration for the New Frontier.\\"<br />There is a song about the protagonist and his Oriental girlfriend and her brother who is angry because he's \\"not my kind\\".<br />This CD is a perfect snapshot of the early 60's told with warmth irony and humor. Every word is perfect. Every note is perfect. It sonically, it is a technical marvel. Everyone should have it. Those interested in history whould dissect it line by line. It takes time to produce a product this good.<br />one of the handful of CD's that really deserve to have five stars. Highest recommendation.lding calls from bigots about \\"a race of men in the trees\\".<br />A song about the early Kennedy-era optimistic buzzword the \\"New Frontier\\" where America could do no wrong. \\"I know you're mad about Brubeck... he's an artist, a poineer.

B000002H70|5.0|I know some of us have those days where we just don't want to get up and at 'em, this album is the answer for that. This album is balls to the wall rock and roll that takes no prisoners. It's upbeat, positive and oooodles of fun. It will cheer you up faster than an episode of perfect strangers. Let's start with Robert Smith, this guy is crazy. His hair is all goofy and he looks like he's already dead. That's why he completely throws you off with his style. He's Axl Rose meets Bette Midler. He's the consumate showman with the ability to get a crowd fired up. He's dynamic with a voice that reminds many of Sebastian Bach of Skid Row. This album captures him at his finest. <br />Pictures of you is a song about, well, pictures of someone. Pretty simple huh? The Cure doesn't make you think, their songs are straight forward and make you so dang happy. After one listen through this album, you can't wipe the smile off my face with a blowtorch. I may look horribly disfigured and rather grotesque from third degree burns, but I'll still be smiling because that's what this album is all about. My favorite song is &quot;Same Deep Water as You&quot; because it just makes me laugh. I think Robert Smith had a pipe bust on his washer and his basement flooded. He figured, hey I'll spin this into a happy tune and darn him he succeeded and then some. You can still hear the band's influence on groups like Foo Fighters, Jimmy Eat World and Nelly.<br />In conclusion, if you're a little dour about life, this is the album for you. It's a hour long happy pill. If you want to be a Stanley Sourpuss, go get you some Hanson.
B00001W9G0|3.0|Barbra Streisand is Katie - a Jewish, pro-communist sympathizer who fights against political propaganda every chance that she gets.  Robert Redford is Hubble Gardner - so Waspish it hurts.  The unlikely romance that blossoms between the two is strangely well suited and doomed to tragedy from the start.  As with most romantic movies of the 1970's, getting to the end is not as important as the circumstances one has to go through to get there.  Here we get a glimpse of the Red Scare of the 1950's and Hollywood's blacklisting.  There's also some strangely sympathetic communist overtones that make for an edgy read, given the political climate of the time.<BR>Columbia Tristar has given us \\"The Way We Were\\" the way that we want it - in essence, though the print is not without its flaws.  Colors can be rich and bold in day time scenes but appear somewhat overly washed out in scenes taking place at night.  There's also an excessive amount of film grain and aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement during one of the night scenes early on, where Streisand and Hubble first swap barbs and become friends.  Inconsistancies in the image quality are riddled throughout though I must say that most of what is presented herein is very nicely done.  The audio has been remixed but continues to sound strident and unnatural.  There are several cases where it even sounds dubbed over.   EXTRAS: we get a self-serving making-of that is rather weak and a theatrical trailer.  That's pretty much it.  For fans of this  movie, it's worth the money.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I have her albums \\"Christina Aguilera\\" and \\"Mi reflejo\\" and I like them very much. So when this tittle came out I bought it (we had to wait for a while)nowadays there are many young singers but Christina has the best voice without question.<BR>I tittled this review like this because of corse who has this album and has also Christina's first you can see more influences of hip hip and R&B on this one but it's worth it because her voice is so good that see can sing salsa and it's gonna sound great.<BR>This album has a great production, has 20 tracks, The second track \\"Can't hold us down\\" has a special appearance by Lil'Kim and in the first single \\"Dirty\\" appears Redman.<BR>As I said the first single was \\"Dirty\\" it became an instant hit all over the world and the video is very good eventhough it had some negative critics. The second single was \\"Beautiful\\" which I think is her best work so far. The song reached #2 on The Hot 100 of Billboard.<BR>The album already had been certified Platinum x2 in the U.s and the selling is being good all over the world.
B00005O3VD|5.0|Barbra Streisand is a young Fanny Brice - inexperienced, desperate to make good on her contract with Florenz Ziegfeld and desperately in love with the first of her two husbands, Nick Arnstein (Omar Shariff). After playing the role on Broadway and making it her own, Bab's took home the Best Actress Oscar of the year for her eclectic, electric and thoroughly engaging performance.  Co-stars Walter Pidgeon.  Director, William Wyler - best known for his efforts in \\"Ben-Hur\\" or \\"Mrs. Miniver\\" has oft' been criticized for his heavy-handed direction on this film.  True - the pace of the musical doesn't rival say, \\"The Sound of Music\\" or \\"West Side Story\\" but the material is so good, and Wyler brings his own inimitable staging to the show, that I can't really fault the old master for a slightly stoic presentation which, if anything, does not detract from the overall enjoyment of this classic movie musical.<BR>Columbia Tristar has done an outstanding job in remastering this movie for DVD.  Colors are rich, vibrant and bold.  Shadow delineation is incredible and contrast levels are as they should be.  Edge enhancement is practically non-existant while shimmering and aliasing simply don't appear on this disc at any time.  This is a fantastic example of just how good an older movie can look on DVD if the proper amount of time and effort is taken to do the job properly.  The soundtrack is remastered in 5.1 and positively explodes across all the channels, particularly during the musical sequences.  Just listening to Bab's do \\"Don't Rain On My Parade\\" or \\"My Man\\" will give one goose bumps.  Bar none, an incredibly solid remastering effort of a vintage soundtrack.  No extras but with quality like this it's hard to squawk.  A very fine effort and a definite must have!
B00005Y228|4.0|I think that this album was one of the best releases of 2002. The second single &quot;Can't get you out of my head&quot; had been heard around the world topping almost every charting list.<BR>Besides the success, the album is great great, it's a great dance album and Kylie's voice is perfect for this kind of music.<BR>There are 3 more hit singles of this album which are: &quot;Come into my world&quot;, &quot;In your eyes&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;Love at first sight&quot;.<BR>The album debuted in the Billboard 200 at #3 and has been certified Platinum in the U.s.<BR>I can't compare this album with another 'cause is unique.
B00003CXA4|4.0|Richard Attenborough's &quot;Gandhi&quot; is a masterfully told, massively mounted epic motion picture, depicting the life and times of Gandhi, a benevolant crusader for peace, whose shocking assassination rocked the world.  Ben Kingsley rightfully took home the Oscar for his subtle but stunning transformation into the title role.  WARNING: This is a slow paced movie but well worth the three hour plus investment of your time.  <BR>Columbia Tristar has given us a very beautiful print of the film.  Colors are rich, bold and vibrant.  Contrast levels are good.  Although black levels are not always at their darkest, this is relatively forgivable, since most of the film takes place during the day.  Shimmering, aliasing and edge enhancement are all present but in extremely minute amounts, leaving one with nothing to do but admire the visual presentation in all of its breathtaking cinematography.  The soundtrack is 2.0 surround but well represented.  Some of the audio has a tendancy to appear thin or strident but, again, considering its dated fidelity and the source material, it is remarkably well represented.  No extras - disappointing for a big time Oscar winner like this.  Perhaps we'll get a special edition eventually.
B000001Y42|1.0|Like on that famous tv show, I will give a brief history of limp biscuit. There was this guy who had a job entertaining kids dressed in a purple suit, but he was so angry he actually decided to form a group (notice I did not say \\"band\\"). He turned on Mtv and he saw an N'Sync video and his lightbulb went off. He had found his calling. So he gathered some guys, gave them instruments to pose with and pretend they were actually playing, and off he was. This is his first attempt, but it failed miserably. Why?  Because he wanted to hide his actual inspiration (n'sync) and make it look like he was \\"tough\\", you know, just like Danny was the \\"tough one\\" in New Kids on the Block. But he wanted everyone in the group to be \\"tough\\" and it just doesn't work. You need to have the cute one, the old one, the young one, the naive one, etc. If all the members put on this fake act of toughness, your fan base will not get it. They are all toddlers. They need the sweet and the sour, you know what I mean? Remember, YOU are jaded and angry, but the kids are not!! You are turning them off. Hopefully, next time around you will show your true colors, and let's see some smiles from the guys while they pose and jump around with their instruments. Believe me, if you do that, you will have a much better chance of coming back strong. The only thing that did keep you around that long was the fact that in spite of your \\"tough\\" exterior and grimacing, the actual \\"music\\" was really poppy, catchy and sweet. But, remember- looks are actually more important for toddlers than the music itself. Keep that in mind.
B000069AUI|5.0|when i heard it firs time  l thought that parachutes was better,BUT BUT when i heard it several times i was came to the conclusion that it is even better.if you like alternative music or coldplay this album is a must!
B000089RW0|5.0|I love the Dark Castle Entertainment movies...ALL OF THEM!!! Yes the movie went from exciting to tedious then back to exciting. The middle was very...Explanitory. But that's ok. It was still gorey and bloody and it still managed to keep me pleased. I bought it and I give it a five.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I know a few people who liked Mulholland Drive, and one who loved it.  Pretty much universally, when they praise the film they say something like, \\"Don't expect a story or a plot ... just enjoy the images and symbolism.\\"  Then the guys add, \\"Oh, and the lesbian scenes.\\"  Then the kicker: \\"Most people just won't get it.\\"  This, of course, in a vaguely disappointed, vaguely pitying tone.<br />There are plenty of movies out there with imagery and symbolism ... AND a story.  I'm actually a damned bright fellow, and if there were anything in Mulholland Drive to \\"get,\\" I'm very capable of getting.<br />But there's not.  Mulholland Drive is a slapped together piece of surrealistic [scenes], disguised as a \\"visual poem.\\"  It's about on par with the work of an average second-year film student.<br />But it DOES have lesbian scenes!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is another CD that is great. It makes a great addition to Hybrid Theory and Reanimation.  Everybody likes &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; which is there 1st single but dont just get it for that, there are other great songs too.  &quot;Don't Say is another good song and so is &quot;Lying for you&quot; so thats just so cool.  Buy the CD its worth it.
B00006RU5B|3.0|What do you get when you mix Rage Against The Machine with Soundgarden?  AUDIOSLAVE! That is exactly it- this is a solid effort but doesn't have any surprises. It is RAM with Chris Cornell vocals and no rap. The disc is a little too mellow for Cornell's voice at times and it seems that 75% of the songs follow the same format of: Kick[en]opening guitar riff - mellow music during the verse - Kick[en] guitar riff w/ chorus - mellow verse - etc. etc.<br />The Rubin production is impeccable but I don't think he pushed hard enough to get the best out of these guys. Tom Morello's guitar tone is super cool and sounds clean but he doesn't do anything much diff. than he did with RAM. <br />Cornell's voice is great as always but he should have done more screaming and sounds his best on the ultra-raspy Cochise.
B000089RVX|4.0|Some reviewers say this band is like Linkin Park as if that is a put down. They do the guitar riffage/singing/spoken word thing like Linkin Park. Also like Linkin Park, they keep the total length relatively short (this CD clocks in at less than 45 minutes, which was a bit long during the LP era), sparing us about 10-15 minutes of filler. Is it worth getting if you like 'Bring Me to Life'? Yes.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones written by Alice Sebold is an outstanding book. I really enjoyed reading this book because it always kept my attention. Unlike most other books that start out with a long, dull introduction, this book gets right into the point.<BR> The main character, Susie Salmon, is also an interesting aspect in this novel, as she tells this story from heaven. She tells us about her rape and murder along with how each character coped with her death. Unbelievable at first, her family finally comes to face the harsh reality of Susies death.<BR> This novel is perfect as it is, I wouldnt change a thing. It was very hard to put down, and kept my attention at all times. Each page kept me in suspense of what might happen next. If you like suspense, this is a good book to read.<BR> I would definitely recommend this book to other peers. It was recommended to me by three of my English teachers, and just as they reported, this book was fantastic
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Neither the video or the commentary(track 12) works on my computer. This is an \\"enhanced cd\\" so they are suposed to be playabe on windows media player.<br />Besides that glitch, this album is GREAT! Tracks 9 and 10 are the same as two other songs on the album, but they are in Russian. I love to listen to those 2 Russian versions eventhough I don't speak that language.
630027120X|5.0|Jeremy Irons and Robert DeNiro shine in this film that tells a story of a Spanish priest, Gabriel, (Irons) and a disgraced ex-slave trader (DeNiro) who killed his own brother (!!)and Gabriel's working with with DeNiro for his pensions for his crimes, and the two building a strong friendship as they make a bunch of native South Americans into Christians. They have an unexpected adversary, as another priest visits thier mission (details escape me) and gives them trouble.<br />Irons and DeNiro face differences, as a battle seems imminent, as Irons trusts his faith in his god, and DeNiro, and two other brothers trust a cold, steel sword.<br />The music packs a BIG punch! Music always plays a big part in a film's sucsess...I think...<br />On the downside: Director Roland Joffe must have been fairly depressed as he made the film. Though the depressive mood fits the story only too well, Joffe COULD have put a little more humor/good times in it. If you get depressed easily this film is not for you.<br />On an up-ish note: The film's storyline is extremely thought provoking. I also think the scene with the little girl rummaging in a half-flooded, half-destroyed building, finding the old violin, and taking it into the boat in which she and her family and tribe were escaping in, makes a beautifully wordless statement of the effect Irons and DeNiro had on them.
6303430570|5.0|Man this movie is one of the most funniest movies during the past 30 years cause it has funny hijinks, bad situations and crude humor, well anyway this movie starts off with Dante who works at a mini mart and he is called in to work for somebody who called in sick and Dante tells the boss that he has a hockey game later that afternoon and he decides to take the shift and later we meet Dante's obnoxious best friend Randall who works at a...video store and he continusly opens and closes the video store to stop in and chat with Dante then we are introduced with Jay and Silent Bob who loiters at the mini mart selling and smoking pot and a few more scenes with the boys would've been more nice but at least we get to see them in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. The boys get into numerous situations with annoying customers who check on experation dates on milk, seeing which is a perfect egg, a guy who wants his coffee with ice, a guy who tells a bunch of customers that smoking kills them and a guy who wants a magazine to read while he's in the bathroom and I'm not going to tell you what else what happens to him and when Randall sold a pack of cigarettes to a 5 year old child and Dante got a $500 fine for it, also the memorable scene when the boys decide to close up the shop to play hockey and a hilarious scene about what happened at the funeral and that scene is a classic. Jay and Silent Bob would go onto success with Mallrats and their own movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and those boys are hilarious especially Jay, if you love low budget comedies, then you'll love Clerks cause it is such a hilarious movie with memorable one liners and good music as well.
0446310786|5.0|I am not going to write a really long review. I can only say that I don't remember a thing from high school...except.. when I was given this book to read. It is a treasure that everyone should read, and then read again. Pass it on to your children, or read it to them. They will thank you one day. Just as I would thank that english teacher if I could.
B00006690G|5.0|The Eminem Show is way different from Eminem's other albums. The lyrics are better and so are the beats. The Eminem Show is pretty similar to Marshall Mathers LP. When I brought this album in the store, I never stopped listening to it. This is the track list of the entire album and a brief description of the songs.<BR>1.Curtains Up[skit])A short six second skit.  <BR>2.White America) In this song you think Eminem is still the same person who disses everyone. He starts talking crap about America. The song has a good beat and is a great start for the album. At the end of the song, he says,\\" I'm just playin America. You Know I Luv You.\\"<BR>3.Bussiness) This song is kind of like \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" from the Marshall Mathers LP.<BR>4.Cleaning Out My Closet) The second single of the album. Has a real good beat. Shady talks about his mother and his father and how much he hates them for hating him.<BR>5.Square Dance) The beat is OK, but not that good. The lyrics aren't so good, either. <BR>6.The Kiss[skit]) This skit is basically an intro to the next song.<BR>7.Soldier) This song talks about Eminem being the strongest and most powerful soldier. This song is not a radio friendly song, since Shady disses and threatens everyone that gets in his way. <BR>8.Say Goodbye Hollywood) Talks about why he had to leave Holywood. He's confused because he didn't do anything wrong. <BR>9.Drips) This song with Obie Trice is just full of cursing and sex talk. <BR>10.Without Me) The first single to the album. Basically, it's a comedy type rap song.<BR>11.Paul Rosenberg[skit])A skit in which a guy named Paul calls Shady telling him to not use his gun.<BR>12.Sing For The Moment) The fourth single for this album. He talks about how hard his life was as a child and how he is so grateful to be so popular and rich now.<BR>13.Superman) The third single for the album. Talks about having sex with a girl and calling her offensive names. The lyrics are good and so is the beat.<BR>14.Hailie's Song) This song was dedicated to Eminem's daughter, Hailie.He talks about how he loves her and how she changed his life.<BR>15.Steve Berman[skit])A short skit in which a guy kills himself.  <BR>16.When The Music Stops) This song sounds like a freestyle because it doesn't have a chorus. Eminem and D-12 rap loud and clear. <BR>17.Say What You Say) This song is produced by Dr.Dre.Eminem raps aggressive and angry like he usually does. Dr.Dre also raps a piece of the song.<BR>18.Till I Collapse) This song has a great car-banging beat. He talks about how he won't quit rapping until the day he dies.<BR>19.My Dad's Gone Crazy) Similar to \\"Without Me\\" but it is much  madder and agressive.<BR>20.Curtains Close[skit]) A funny skit to end the album.   <br />This is Eminem's best album so far. Hopefully, he'll keep making albums like this.
B000001DTM|5.0|Some people say that this is when U2 started to get &quot;bad.&quot; But any real U2 fan should love this album.  It's incredable from the moment it starts to the disapointing ending seconds.<BR>This U2 album has some of the greatest U2 songs they've ever made including. &quot;ONE&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, and many more.<BR>If you stoped listening to U2 after this albun you need to pick it up again lisen to the lyrics and words and you'll see that is one clasic U2 albums that should be charished!
B00006CXSS|5.0|After meeting an Easy Company veteran (one of the featured people in the book that led to the miniseries you're now reading about), he told me he was involved a little bit in the production of this series.<br />I have read a lot on the Second World War, and spoken with many veterans.  This effort, though, slightly changed from the book of the same name by Stephen Ambrose, left me awed by what the Army had to deal with as they invaded Fortress Europe, and the amount of detail that HBO sought to include when the series was made.<br />While some may complain that this series is too pro-U.S., their complaints are pointless.  The book itself was based on the experiences of one unit, and given what they fought for, and what they saw, ther eshould be little surprise at that fact.  What does stand out is the efforts made to show the very real horrors of combat and how even the innocent can be swept into battle; one Belgian family's experiences as their farm turns into a battleground is shown, and makes it all the more human.<br />I greatly enjoyed this series, and would recommend it to anyone trying to get more a of a picture of the Second World War in more than just the occasional two hour movie- it's well worth the time.
B00006LLNU|5.0|( ) that's all Sigur Ros wanted to say, no credits, no song names, music is everything in this album...vocals...are just beautiful, this CD is ideal for a sad day, specially if it's raining, I loved the whole album, altough it isn't as good as Agaetis Byurn it is still something diferent from all the mainstream, if you don't like it I recommend you first hear Pink Floyd instrumental suites, Brian Eno ambiental songs, Verve's A storm in heaven album and some Radiohead stuff, they can be just the near refferences for Sigur Ros that is something very diferent to all the stuff you ever heard.

0060001941|5.0|I found out about \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" from Oprah. I didn't think a woman worth 40 billion would have time for a 60-year-old book about a poor New York tenement family at the turn-of-the-century. I was wrong. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is an epic, detailed history of a destitute Irish family in 1912 big-city America. Father Johnny Nolan is a some-times singing waiter, mother Katie washes floors, and little Neely and Francie joust with cruel teachers, two-faced policemen, and self-serving neighbors. Dinner consists of stale bread and onion soup. They celebrate on Saturday night, when five bucks buys a mutton dinner. But \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is not all sad. It's filled with the love and tenderness only struggling family life  can provide. Late one night, Johnny comes home tipsy, singing enchanting Irish tunes. Little Francie meets him at the door. He smiles, he winks, he gives her a tune. She turns away and faces the wall. A hot tear runs down her face. She doesn't want her father to know how much she really loves him...If you're tired of Stephen King mind-games and over-rated \\"How To\\" books, diversify into a heart-felt love-fest with this famous classic by Betty Smith.  Somewhere in nineteenth century America, a little girl struggles for love and recognition. A tiny root pushes through cracks in the cement. A brave slender branch juts up, searching for the sun-light. A single vine might survive until the rain comes. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\".
1573226521|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a while.  It really kept my interest, and I was annoyed when I had to put it down.  The story is infinitely better than the motion picture (as is usually the case).  It was easy to hate the main character, Richard, in many ways since he did inhumane things without regard to others.  The irony is how he survives the end of life at the beach, which was largely caused by his actions.  There's an implied sense of justice against those in charge at the beach when Richard and his friends flee.  This is also ironic since he has basically crashed in on the life they've so carefully made for themselves.
0767827791|5.0|Hal Carter is a middle-aged drifter jumping freight trains through middle America. He hops off in a small Kansas town and  looks up his old college buddy, Alan Benson.Hal finds out that Hal's father owns the grainery; the richest business in town. Alan also controls Madge Owens, a buxom 20-year-old who finds Hal attractive. Hal is invited to the local Labor Day picnic. Bread-belt Americans lunch and frolic. Two babies sit in a hamster. One laughs. One crys. Suddenly, both start to cry. You watch. You laugh. It's real.  Hal meets the family group, including the spinster school-teacher. A bottle gets passed around, and the schoolmarm wises up to Hal. She identifies his failed careers; she attacks his dis-jointed life-style. Stunned and hurt, Hal retreats to the nearby town river, ready to jump another freight car; ready to escape again. But pretty young Madge hasn't quite seen enough of the dashing stranger from out of town....Joshua Logan began acting on Broadway in the 1930's, advancing to directing through the 40's and 50's with real success.In 1955, Columbia Pictures tapped him to direct William Inge's hit New York play, \\"Picnic\\". The film would gross over 6 million dollars,a big pay-day for those times. Logan's \\"Picnic\\" is a tantilizing, warm visit to 1950's America, blessed with style and class.Award winning William Holden heads the cast, aided by a young Cliff Robertson, Arthur O'Connell, Kim Novak, Rosalind Russell, and a teen-age Susan Strasberg. Future star Nick Adams has a small role. Shot on location in glorious Technicolor, \\"Picnic\\" offers no fancy special-effects, no nude scenes and no CGI. It delivers character development, genuine sentiment and excellent direction. Joshua Logan would go on to direct \\"South Pacific\\", \\"Sayonara\\"and under-rated \\"Camelot\\". This beautiful new DVD is nearly flawless. Some pixelation in the river-bank sequence is evident. Some critics say William Holden was too old for the lead in \\"Picnic\\", but at age 37, he was just hittinghis prime. Some say \\"Picnic\\" is too old-fashioned. But don't they know.

0736041850|5.0|I've been strength training for a while now.  I've taken weight lifting classes, but was never given a book that so precisely explains exactly what muscles are being used.  I was looking for a book that would show me which exercises to use to isolate specific muscles and this is the book.  It is extremely detailed and shows you in-depth diagrams of the muscles at work.  It helps if you know a little about the muscular skeleton to start with, but if you don't this is still a very good book.
0783225547|4.0|[Dolby Digital Version]<BR>Movie Rating: C<BR>Video.......: B+<BR>Audio.......: A-<BR>Extras......: D<br />Overall: C+<br />You must leave any sense of skepticism behind in order to enjoy this movie, but less so than &quot;Volcano&quot;. Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton are great actors, and they show it in this movie. However, don't expect anything more than a popcorn flick. That being said, Dante's Peak does give some great thrills now and then. It's a good movie to watch with your sound system turned up -- it will certainly give it a workout. Surround details are not distracting, as many movies of this genre can become. I would suspect that the DTS version of this disc has a more enveloping surround field, because the surround field fell a bit flat from time to time in this Dolby Digital version. The video is very good, with few artifacts visible from the compression. Considering the huge amounts of smoke and fog in this movie, that's an acheivement.<br />Overall, a good disc for some home theater thrill rides.
B00005QIPH|5.0|first off, this is one of the best albums in recent times. you can tell how good a band is by how many bands the record companies produce that sound and look like the originator. the strokes have given the alt-rock movement some new life and created the attention the white stripes, hives, etc. are getting now. but anyways, pick up this album and listen to it. you wont be disappointed.
630575067X|5.0|What is so awful about this movie? All I've seen at this site is DISTURBINGLY negative reviews of it, calling for the torture and death of Jar Jar Binks and calling the movie a \\"steaming heap of refuse\\" or words to that effect. Are you people SERIOUS?! Qui Conn Jinn I have to wonder about, granted, but Natalie Portman, for her young years, is an excellent actress....She seems much more mature than the 20 or so solar cycles she's seen.<br />Yes, granted, Jar Jar Binks is a pain in the [...], but for my money, C3PO is STILL the most irritating character in the Star Wars pantheon. Why is he even THERE? R2D2 is the robot that usually pulls everybody's fat out of the fire at the last minute...what has 3PO done? Saved Luke and Han from the Ewoks in \\"Return of the Jedi\\"? I think they and Chewbacca could have eventually handled them.<br />Anyway, back to \\"Phantom\\". While I take pains to defend the film, there ARE a few things wrong with it, some MAJOR things, not the least of which is Qui Conn Jinn's fawning interest in little Annakin! For instance, a little too much of it is reminiscent of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" in the beginning, especially as Qui Conn, Jar Jar and Obi Wan leave Gungan.<br />Speaking of Gungan, I like Boss Nass as a character, with his odd speech pattern and facial tics. Very original character concept, if you ask me. Schmi Skywalker is also a great character, (\\"Schmi\\"?! Why was she named after a villain in \\"Peter Pan\\"?) She exudes a tranquil persona that permeates every scene she's in. Pernilla August handles this part beautifully. WHY was she killed off in \\"Attack of the Clones\\"??<br />The art direction....? Nonpareil! Though not the equal of \\"Attack of the Clones\\", if \\"Phantom\\" didn't win the 1999 Oscar(r) for art direction or visual effects, a fix was in for the actual winner, because few movies can equal this or its sequel for pure visual mastery. (Or pure cheek!)<br />The plot? What was wrong with the plot? Granted the pathos and strong feelings from \\"New Hope\\" aren't there because THIS IS NOT \\"NEW HOPE\\"!! This movie didn't have the luxury or inherent specialness of being the founder of a film dynasty and institution, and it does put some light on the beginnings of Annakin Skywalker/Darth Vader and what made him so special in the eyes of the Jedi and the Empire. Sorry, but we will never again see the image of the remains of Beru and Owen amongst the ruins of their smoking residence, or Luke's stunned reaction to it. Never see Luke blow up Deathstar with the spirit of justice guiding his every move. Never see him shreik in outrage as his own father kills Obi Wan Kenobi right in front of his eyes. Never see Princess Leia surprise Han and Luke by firing a gun like a pro that first time. Nope...never. Deal with it.<br />This movie could have been garbage, like \\"Return of the Jedi\\", which is, as far as I'm concerned, the REAL stinker amongst the Star Wars films! Lucas certainly didn't have to exert himself for the bucks, now did he? However, I will put this up against \\"2010: The Year We Make Contact\\", \\"Ghostbusters II\\" \\"Alien Resurrection\\", \\"Batman & Robin\\", \\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\" and any ONE of Spielberg's little money factory originals or sequels any day of the week for quality!<br />About the only other thing that bugs me about this movie and \\"Clones\\" together is that Ewan McGregor is NOT a convincing young Obi Wan. Forty-five, fifty years ago, Alec Guiness pretty much looked, sounded and acted as he did in \\"New Hope\\" to \\"Jedi\\". It's impossible to imagine McGregor developing Guiness' distinctive speech patterns and mannerisms along the way to his dotage. Where's the nasal tone? The smirk? Believe me, nobody changes that much over the course of a lifetime, I don't care HOW much they age! All in all, NOTHING should prevent you from buying this movie...not the condemnations of fanboys, not the homicidal sentiments toward Jar Jar Binks or anything ELSE! Buy this for what it is...another great addition to THE Royal Family of popcorn movies!<br />THEN...analyze it!Royal Family of popcorn movies!<br />THEN...analyze it!
B00008H2LB|5.0|first off, this band has progressed so much it boggles me.<BR>Their musical sense has greatly improved (they even go into triplets in one song the whole length of it) and mix up the meters some and it really improves the music.<BR>The one thing i didnt notice, if anything, was the disturbing absence of a real drumset. The DJ fills it in fine, but some songs lack the sound of a REAL set.<BR>That aside, this CD ROCKS! The rapping has improved, and the songs are so different you never get bored. Its almost like gettin a new band every track, except not. Its definatly good.<BR>There are no breaks, so its seemless the whole way.. a good idea carried over from hybrid theory.<BR>Final verdict:Buy this CD
B000075BFK|4.0|Though not one of his better CD's, Better Dayz is still a very good CD.  Especially Disc Two.  Pac's best CD will be, and always be the first, 2PACOLYPSE NOW.  Straight up hardcore (Young Black Male, Soulja Story pt. 1, Violent) but extremely sincere (Brenda's Gotta Baby, and When My Homies Call, one of the realest tracks he ever recorded).  ALL EYEZ ON ME might be his best produced album, but 2PACOLYPSE NOW along with STRICTLY 4 MY NIGGAZ are his best.  Disc Two of Better Dayz, is more r&b-ish but definitely a crowd pleaser.  The remix of \\"My Block\\" is good considering how much I enjoyed the original version of the song.  Then the R&B-ish version of \\"Thugz Mansion\\" is head and shoulders better than that sorry acoustic version.  Though, I liked the acoustic version, but I would have enjoyed it better without NAS on it.  The next track is for the ladies (courtesy of PAC on every album) called I'll Never Call You B***ch Again w/Tyrese is deep and a head bouncer.  Then the title track Better Dayz is a R-Kelly-ish type of song (featuring Ronald Isley in the backround) that you open the sunroof to and nod your head on a nice spring, late sumeer evening.  The lyrics is deep.  \\"U Can Call Me\\" is definitely a club jam, and the slow tempo \\"There you go\\".  Disc Two by itself is better than all the hip hop albums I've heard all year (yes, even better than 50 cent).  Disc One was a little more disappointing because some of the songs are dated, and the remixes did them no justice at all.  But the bomb track on Disc One no doubt is \\"Never Be Peace\\".  \\"Changed Man\\" and \\"Late Night\\" are killer PAC tracks.  Overall, the album is pretty good and I enjoy at least 9 tracks that I play to death so that's something good for a double CD. I just wished more tracks of him instead of the Outlawz were being released.  Nothing against the Outlawz, but they take away the creativity of some of PAC's songs.  I did like this better than Jay-Z's Gift and the Curse double CD.  Then he has the nerveto come out with \\"Gift and the Curse 2.0\\".  Is that Jay-Z's version of X-Men 1.5 or something.  I wish PAC's mom would find better producers to work with in creating these albums.  She still has business dealings with \\"Suge Knight\\" but no matter what, PAC's lyrics always shines through on anything cuz his sh**t is real and still holds true to form in today's time.  Jay-Z and Ja Rule might be selling records, but they'll never have the following, or the mad love from the streets the way PAC still does.  Instead of imitating, and stealing PAC's songs, both of those artists need to keep it real.  Those two are clear as saran wrap and the facade is over.  Jay-Z isn't even the best rapper in his own click anymore and Ja Rule well, we know where that pop diva is heading.   2PACOLYPSE NOW, 2PACOLYPSE FOREVER.
B000002KJM|5.0|I hear alot about DeGuello being a fan favorite and I own their entire catalog,have seen them several times on different tours and if you really want ZZ at thier finest, pick this one up.Frankly, I don't believe any other ZZ recording matches the \\"First\\". It's the type of music that will crush you, very basic and when turned up to maximum on your sound system can make your hair stand.Put on \\"just got back from baby's\\" or \\"brown sugar\\" and you'll see what I mean. It shreds from start to finish, no spit,no polish, just pure from the gut.True Tone, Taste and Tenacity. Enjoy!
0553579908|1.0|The book is SORRY and I'm SORRY I wasted my money on it.  It's like a bad comedian that stoops to explicit dirty jokes and cussing to be funny - but he's not - he's just gross.  It's that kind of sloppy fiction that relies on inhuman grit that isn't \\"reality\\" as professed by some, but a sorry world of sorry people with no real hero's that could ever drag that world from the slime.

B00000JR2A|5.0|SOL has been one of my all time favorite albums even until today and I guess this says a lot about the band. There has not been another album quite as superb as this (if anyone has found one please let me know) and it certainly puts the band high up in my list of favorite albums of the 20th century.<br />Roland Orzabal is definitely the genius here and it is sad that he has not been able to repeat this astounding feat in the later years. The techniques employed in this album are so superb and the layers of orchestration are so amazing and bordering on opulence, it is not surprising that this is one album that will beg for your attention on your first and subsequent listening.<br />The first single \\"Sowing The Seeds Of Love\\" immediately brought in rave reviews and favorable comparisons to the Fab Four. But it is the other songs that are real gems. Oleta Adams with her soulful and endearing vocals opens the album with gusto in \\"Woman In Chains\\". This is then followed by what I believe is one of the most accomplished song ever written in pop history - \\"The Badman's Song\\" - just listen and marvel at its most intricately wound verses of vocals and instrumentations! Simply heavenly!<br />\\"Advice for the young at heart\\" features the excellent voice of Curt Smith to the fore and this one well written song which truly deserve to linger forever in our memories of sweet love songs that will never be overplayed till death. \\"Year Of The Knife\\" will certainly put all other rock bands in their respective lower rungs and \\"Famous Last Words\\" definitely places Orzabal among the most respected songwriters of the century.<br />The rest of the songs do not dissapoint either and they all feature the same impeccable vocals and mesmerizing instrumentations that somehow manages to blend themselves into one unholy union of incredible tunes.<br />Credits have to be given to the producers, technicians and guest artistes too but I really believe Roland is the dude here. He deserves all the applause and you definitely deserve to listen to this album even if this is one last rock album you will ever buy!plause and you definitely deserve to listen to this album even if this is one last rock album you will ever buy!
B00003CXFU|4.0|Julia Roberts has proven to be a very successful actress in many of her previous movies. Now in this one, Erin Brockovich, she proves she is one of Hollywood's best actresses. The movie is based on a true story also.<br />The movie starts out with Erin (Roberts) applying for a job and doesn't get it. She has been divorced twice and has to three kids to feed. So she gets into a car accident and sues the man who hit her. She loses. No money there. So she ends up working at her lawyer's firm.

This won't be easy. The people that have gotten diseases want to be in court when the trial goes on and that will take forever if there is a jury. Now Erin must visit everyone (624) and get them to sign a document that agrees them to having a no jury. Now here comes the trial.<br />Watch Erin come from being a sexy Miss Witchita to a successful attorney assistant. Will she and her attorney Ed win?
B00005JLSC|4.0|\\"Chicago\\" is a film whose cast members are movie stars. They know they're stars, the camera knows it, and we know it; and we see why they're stars. They're having fun, and so are we.<br />By depicting the musical numbers as figments of Roxie's imagination, \\"Chicago\\" is able to remain faithful to the Kander/Ebb/Fosse stage musical on which it's based, retaining the device of presenting the musical numbers as vaudeville acts. This device was surely adopted for this reason, and not out of a phobia of having characters burst into song. It is to be hoped that, if \\"Chicago\\" helps revitalize the movie musical, there will be plenty of musicals in the next few years that will make audiences comfortable again with this convention, which has never gone away in Bollywood movies.<br />\\"Chicago\\"'s only real flaw is its lack of admirable or likeable characters and its corresponding lack of a satisfying moral dimension. Velma and Roxie learn nothing from their crimes and ultimately benefit financially from them; poor Amos is left abandoned and broken-hearted. We see Billy and Momma attending the show in the final sequence, but not Amos. But this flaw comes directly from the source musical, and can be seen as part of the story's artistic meaning. \\"Chicago\\" is intended to be a parody of the importance and fleeting nature of celebrity in America. Nonetheless, this slight imperfection is the main reason I personally preferred \\"Adaptation\\" and \\"The Hours\\" to \\"Chicago\\" among 2002's movies. \\"Chicago\\" is, however, still worthy to stand among the winners of the Best Picture Oscar.<br />See \\"Chicago\\". Watch as Catherine Zeta-Jones sings and dances like the wind off Lake Michigan, as Renee Zellweger makes us feel for a slightly reprehensible character, as Richard Gere's pure star power razzle-dazzles us, as Queen Latifah shows us what a phenomenon she is, as Lucy Liu and Christine Baranski delight us in their small roles. And look out in particular for John C. Reilly's \\"Mr. Cellophane\\", perhaps the most incandescent moment in a year at the movies filled with such moments.<br />These are our Hollywood legends. These are the memories we will share with our children. This is our golden age of the movies.
B000002AGB|5.0|Warning; this album is mean to be played LOUD, so if your stereo system consists of a portable cd player or one of those $80 mini-systems, I don't recommend this to you, if however, you have at least 150 watts to your record, keep reading!<br />This album is much more interesting than Leeds, it's much more 'souped up' as one could say. The mixing is suberb, Keith's drums crashing right and left, the who may as well be playing in your living room! The songs are some of the best in the who's catalogue, 'Young man blues', 'summertime blues' and 'I don't even know myself are all fantastic. 'Naked eye' and The tommy parts don't add much to their studio-recorded equivalents, but 'water' (not studio recorded until 1973) is absoulutely fantastic. The album is especially well-packaged, I recommend the rare UK LP version if you can get your hands on it, with 180 gram vinyl! Either way, you're most likely to become (a. very happy with this record or (b. a neigbourhood noise regulation menace!
B00005NWM3|2.0|Nickelback has really become painful for me to listen to anymore.  The State was decent and I thought showed great promise for the future.  Then I heard &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; for the first time on the radio.  I absolutely loved it (this was obviously before every radio station in the world completely played it into the ground) and so I was very much looking forward to this release.  I bought it the first day it came out, poped it into the CD player, and was immediately greated with the best song on the CD, &quot;Never Again.&quot;  Great lyrics, great message, great everything!  Then &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; which I still loved at the time.  Then the next 2 songs that I also loved.  Then, we hit song 5, which is basicly the same song as song 6, which is basicly the same song as song 7, which is basicly the same as....you get the idea.  I still believe that Nickelback has some talent, and could be great if they would put forth the effort to make an entire CD, instead of quitting after 4 songs like they did here.  Unfortunately, this effort has brought them a lot of publicity and money, so they most likely won't see the need to put forth any extra effort on their next release.  If you haven't already purchased this CD, please don't give Nickelback more money for this garbage.  You can hear the good stuff off this CD any time you turn on the radio, so there is absolutely no need to buy the rest.  Shame on you Nickelback, you could have been really great.

B00005JKZT|4.0|Peter Jackson tackles a very difficult task, transforming a written saga onto the big screen. There are legions of LotR fans who will scrutinize every scene; yet, there are many in the audience who have never read the book(s). On the whole, PJ did very well.<br />The acting was first-rate across the board. I must give my kudos to Andy Serkis (and the CGI crew) for bringing Gollum to life. This is the most impressing feat in the movie. Orlando Bloom has the best moves! The bow and arrow play and skate-boarding down the stairs of the Deeping Wall (Helm's Deep) are (enjoyably) outrageous! Elijah Woods wonderfully brings out a Frodo slowing losing control to the Ring, sliding into Darkness. Frodo is losing his innocence.<br />It is great to see CGI used to complement the movie instead of dominating it. Incorporation of CGI with \\"real\\" actors grows more seamless. Isengard is truly barren and bereft of beauty; its army a dismaying sight as it sorties towards Rohan. Helm's Deep looks impregnable; a testament to the ancient power of Gondor. Osgiliath is a present testament to Gondor; a power swiftly fading into ruin.<br />Remember, Edoras was not a CGI construct. The crew built a real Edoras. This testifies to how much PJ cared about making the movie.<br />The musical score complemented the movie very nicely. IMHO, music is a very subjective thing. The Rohan thread (especially the hardanger) is very moving to me. I agree with the comment that the victory score from Helm's Deep (as Gandalf & Eomer charge into the Uruk-hai) is the most uplifting I have come across.<br />However, the transformation of certain characters is the biggest disappointment in the movie. I agree with the criticisms of how the Ents were portrayed. Faramir should have remained the anti-thesis of his brother Boromir. What really makes me frown is the transformation of Theoden from the fearless king into a feckless shell. How can someone who was rescued from \\"dark dreams\\" by Gandalf continue to be so weak? I would much rather see Bernard Hill portray a fearless, aging king refusing to be \\"caught like a badger in a trap!\\" Happily, we begin to see the real Theoden towards the end of the battle. This point is personal because Theoden is my favorite character from the book.<br />That aside, I still enjoyed the movie very much! Several friends who never read the book enjoyed it as well, so PJ seems to accomplish this important goal. I strongly recommend reading the book.
B000002J1H|3.0|Yes Combats Punk With Shorter Songs.<br />In 1977, the punk music scene took off in America and the UK. And though some may feel that Punk was the dumbing down of popular culture, quite a majority of it had something to say about culture, status quo and outmoded thought. It holds the distinction of being Art in context that it has message with intent, musically and lyrically. Now Yes, with its emergence in 1969, certainly has claims to producing art with its music. Anyone familiar with classical music will know that all Yes did (and very well) was take the movements and structuring of classical music and interpret that with a bass, guitar, drums, vocal and keyboard reading. At its best pre-1977 ('Close To The Edge', 'The Yes Album', 'Relayer' and parts of 'Fragile') Yes did this with an amazing amount of musicianship, inspiration, energy and drive, and with clear focus. Lyrically, Anderson is at his best when he simplifies his spiritual quest. When he tries to paint 'word pictures' the meaning of the piece becomes clouded by irrelevant text and confusing, mixed meaning. 'A seasoned witch can rearrange your liver to its solid mental grace' may look pretty, but honestly says nothing whatsoever, and to a degree Anderson can be held responsible for Yes's misunderstood place in the history of current Western music.<br />Rick Wakeman returned to Yes in 1977. Tales From Topographic Oceans (1973) convinced him to leave Yes, as he felt the four 20 minute songs on that album were not the direction Yes should have been heading, whereas Anderson was thoroughly convinced that it was. He returned to Yes feeling that this is where they should be in 1977, in agreeance with Anderson about the musical direction. His view was that both took separate routes to arrive at the same point. And Going For The One was that conclusion. Aiming to return to the shorter song stylings of their first two albums, but with the musical technique that the Howe/Wakeman/White/Squire configuration offers, all seemed to feel this was where Yes was going in the late 1970's.<br />For me personally, this and the next album (Tormato) nearly killed the band or forced them to become a relic of the 70's.<br />Where 1974's Relayer incorporated elements of jazz &amp; funk, and further used the music to illustrate lyrically what Anderson has problems saying, Going For The One sounds forced and uninspired to my ears. Its not only the material, but the production on the album altogether. Many instruments are buried in a heavily layered, murky mix that seems to focus on Howe and Wakeman, and leave Squire &amp; White buried underneath it all. This is just in a production and engineering context of course, but this album sounds too dense and messy to actually focus on elements that they were trying to portray in the music.<br />Now, it seems Anderson &amp; Wakeman are still extremely pleased with this album, and they are perfectly allowed to do so. As a listener, I was disappointed by its lack of strong material. I think Squire's 'Parallels' will always be my favourite from this Yes album, but it too is buried underneath a huge church organ, numerous background vocals and too much soloing from Howe. It seems this whole album is one long solo from either Howe or Wakeman, and after awhile it starts stomping all over the music and melodies supplied by the voices, which are themselves buried.<br />Anderson also feels the 15 minute 'Awaken' is one of Yes's greatest achievements. Honestly, I have tried to like this song for years and years, almost 25 years in fact, and in all that time I find this whole song to be overlong, repetitive and illustrating once again the faults that can be found throughout 'Tales from Topographic Oceans'. Movements of music that go nowhere, or seem unrelated to what has been played before, or just provide backing to an extended solo. The beginning of 'Awaken' is certainly strong, Wakeman's piano introduction and then the entrance of the main rhythm of the piece. But after 5 minutes of this same rhythm , and the same melodies being sung over it, it becomes, just boring. There's nothing their to grab someone's attention anymore. Finally the second movement comes in, which is quieter, moodier, accented by Wakeman's synthesiser, White's chimes and Anderson's harp. And once again this goes on and on with no change. Honestly, to me this is one of Yes's weakest pieces of work in a pretty high standard that was set before.<br />I think Going For The One signified that something had to drastically change in the Yes format. I don't know about other fans, but I know for myself, whenever I see the Anderson/Wakeman/Squire/White/Howe line-up reconvene, my heart does not jump for joy. Though I'm appreciative of the talents that go in to Yes music when these 5 people get together, I honestly find their collaborations go nowhere fast. Repetition for the sake of length (?), movements that seem unrelated to eachother, multi-layered vocals that bury instrumentation, 4 minute Steve Howe solos that expose moreso his limitations than his strengths. Their music just wanders around, trying to find a home somewhere, and no more more so than on Tales From Topographic Oceans, Going For The One, Tormato and the studio tracks from Keys To Ascension.<br />This album is for the classic Yes fan. Its three stars I gave for 'Parallels' , the effort that went into the album as a whole, and the talent that sometimes showed through the murk.ce. But after 5 minutes of this same rhythm , and the same melodies being sung over it, it becomes, just boring. There's nothing their to grab someone's attention anymore.

B00008H2LB|5.0|This is a great CD.  It is well constructed and powerful, despite the fact that it is only about 37 minutes in length.  This whole CD is great, it had no [bad] songs to skip.  EVERY SINGLE SONG IS AMAZING in its own way.  I have to admit, I didn't think that this album would live up to Hybrid Theory, but I was definitely proven wrong.  Just as Hybrid Theory had done, Meteora spoke to me, pointing out things that related to my life and that were important to me.  It's like they took the words I wanted to say out of my head and put them to a melody.  I couldn't believe how much I could relate to it.

B000002C1V|5.0|One of the greatest anti-war statements made in the last century. That includes every piece of literature, film, theatre production and piece of art made in damnation of the practice of war and the games politicians play with human life.<br />Many critics and reviewers started honing in on Roger Waters 'pre-occupation' with his father's death in 1944, amidst the horrors of World War II. Using this as a weapon, critics mauled Waters comments on the basis that how can a popular artist complain about a situation that is resigned to the past, when obviously the fortunes of that artist have allowed them luxuries not given to the previous generation affected by circumstances of war. In a nutshell, what right do you have to complain when you're on top of the world. (Figuratively speaking). The word pretentious often springs to mind when I recall these reviews of The Wall and The Final Cut.<br />I have never been in agreeance with this view of Waters lyrical power and the focus of his artistic vision. His comments and sometimes merciless attacks on the political leaders at that time, and previous leaders, somehow leaves The Final Cut timeless. What Waters complained about then, is happening now and always will unless we change. Regardless of Thatcher, Reagan, Haig, we will always have new faces to replace them if we continue on this path where the only solutions are blood and the spilling of it.<br />Waters observations about complacency, the dying of empire, the vacousness of media, the unnecessary loss of life all strike their target. His words are acute and piercing, and paint a vivid portrait of working class, upper class, and political society, where names are mentioned, but it is unimportant, because the situations are the same then as they are now.<br />An aside to this is the personal politic happening within Pink Floyd. That Waters became so strident in his visions, that certain members (Gilmour/Mason) are left with little to do but augment. And though I may not personally agree with Waters tactics in attaining his artistic visions, and that group effort is sacrificed, the work itself and what it says makes it somehow worth it. The statements made on this album are powerful, thought provoking, and not only lyrically.

1400034779|5.0|It is not often that an old established genre like &quot;Mystery&quot; has a new and original character and story.  It is a bit slow at times but it is always fun, life afirming, and warm.  Don't miss it.
B000069HKH|5.0|Does Amazon.com really need another review of The Rising?  I don't know; I haven't read the other 470+.  These songs resonate with spirituality in the deepest, broadest, least denominational sense of the word.  Two explore 9/11's losses as felt by Muslims.  (I cannot but think that the subtleness was lost since there has not been an outcry to crush the CD under a street roller.)<br />If you buy this CD, give it its full due: sit down with the lyrics booklet, & hear the individual words. You will be invited to mourn and pray with a variety of survivors.  The characters are so sharply, fully drawn that a stage play could be written from them. The songs will break your heart, and give you hope again.
B00008MNYS|5.0|forget whatever you are doing right now.  purchase the new robby williams \\"Escapology\\" cd...  just do it...but sooner or later youre going to get to 7 minutes and 42 seconds of pure ape-tastic bliss...  you'll have such a good time listening to it, you'll swear you're dressed like a puppy.<br />so just do it, and dont give me any more lip.  serriously, i've always been a marginal fan of mr. williams.  i undoubtedly respect his humour.  and he has certainly grown up since take that, and even \\"millenium.\\"  but i must say that i just really enjoy this album.  its nothing incredible, but it just feels like such a solid buy.  its so funny, and fun to listen to.  it makes me think that im listening to fran healy's (travis) evil twin.  its just so simple, yet full and lush, and good.  just buy it already.
B00003CXTF|4.0|Great movie. Everyone should see this. I think this a great love story and a really great depiction of the actual thing. A little graphic but its rated R. I love this movie. A real piece of good film.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I'm a fan of Miyazaki's works (My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery Service, being the most popular) and out of all of them, I must say Spirited Away was probaly the best! While all of the ones I saw were wonderful, this one sticks out the most in my mind. The storyline is very original, as it is for all ages to enjoy. It's not kiddy while not adult-oriented at the same time. It's very neutral in the way it presents itself. The animation is crisp and fresh as you get a good view of Japan's countryside and every detail goes into the backgrounds and characters. Every detail and action seems very realistic. The music is also a very nice addition to sum up the way the scenes are being presented. This is a movie you do not want to miss!
B00005221M|5.0|I really like this film. It is fantastic, and well performed by Daniel Day Lewis. The sounds are great, the landscapes are beautiful, and the film is extremely exciting.<BR>I recomend to all. It is a classic.
B000003S0R|5.0|Amid all the discussion of Eno's innovations, people sometimes forget that he has the one quality that REALLY matters for a musician:  personality.  I can't vouch for his &quot;ambient&quot; works because I've never had the patience to listen to anything like that, but the four &quot;song&quot; albums he made in the 70s are loaded with personality.  Eno could be weird and idiosyncratic, but there is also plenty of humor and even warmth in this music.  And &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain&quot; was his greatest achievement, in my opinion.<br />There is something weird and mysterious going on in every one of these songs, many of which refer to some sort of quest. The overall feel is something like that of a child playing spy games, although often the imagery is disturbing or menacing in a way that no child could have imagined.  Memorable phrases are constantly jumping out at you:  <br />&quot;Certain streets have certain corners<BR>Sooner or later we'll turn yours.&quot;  <br />&quot;Sweet Regina's on the plane a Newsweek on her knees<BR>While far below the curlews call from strangely stunted trees.&quot;<br />&quot;Let me just point out discreetly though you never learn.<BR>All those tawdry late night weepies I can make you weep more cheaply.&quot;  <br />And then there's the sinister lullaby &quot;Put a Straw Under Baby,&quot; which I've learned was inspired by Eno's Catholic upbringing and can be read as a child's misinterpretation of religious symbolism.  <br />The music all has a weird texture, even though most of it was produced by traditional rock and roll instruments.  &quot;Third Uncle&quot; and &quot;The True Wheel&quot; both contain some truly wicked, flipped-out lead guitar work by Phil Manzanera.  The entire album is filled with catchy pop melodies and instrumental hooks that will draw you in immediately, and there is plenty of detail in both sound and words to keep you coming back time after time.  This is one of the most treasured albums in my collection.  <br />(Note to Eno fans:  If you have not read Eric Tamm's book &quot;Brian Eno:  His Music and the Vertical Color of Sound,&quot; you need to get ahold of a copy, whether at a library or on the Web.  I believe it is out of print.  It's one of the best books I've read about a musician or group.)

B000089RVX|5.0|if you all think this cd is good...you have to hear their old stuff and 3 songs that didn't make the final album cut. Songs like Understanding, Forgive Me, Missing, Breath No More, Further Away, and so many more will totally rock your ears! Evanescence's sound is totally unique compared to the [poor music] that's out there right now, that's why they're on the top 10 on the billboard for almost 5 weeks now. Job well done.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|It's hard for me to believe that it has actually been more than 20 years since this CD came out.  I remember when MTV made such a big deal when the \\"Thriller\\" video came out, playing it to what was then and may still be the biggest audience MTV has ever had.  The hype was incredible, with a \\"making of\\" video and interviews with Michael Jackson, dancers, and even Vincent Price.<br />\\"Thriller\\" continues to fight for the title of the biggest selling CD of all time with the Eagles' first volume of greatest hits.  While the musical influence of \\"Thriller\\" has been significantly less than that of many other works, it remains an excellent collection of pop music, and marks the peak of Michael Jackson's career.<br />In reviewing \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" by Alice Cooper, I stated that anything with Vincent Price in it is likely to be good.  The title track fits that statement perfectly.  Vincent Price is superb, with an incomparable laugh to help finish his monologue.  Vincent Price has such a wonderful voice for speaking roles such as that in \\"Thriller\\".  The title track is a wonderful, almost campy song.  The horns and beat were perfect, middle-of-the-road pop.  While the song is campy, the mildly dark elements helped mark a transition in Michael's music to darker, angrier themes.<br />Another song which has some of these same dark elements is \\"Beat It\\".  The video highlighted well that this song was a theme song for the pent up emotions and frustrations of teenagers everywhere.  A fast song with a theme that would readily fit into a modern version of \\"West Side Story\\", the elements of this song was one of Michael's angriest songs of the time, and hinted at things to come.<br />As if \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Beat It\\" were preludes, the third song with dark elements in it is \\"Billie Jean\\".  While the song has an easy beat and relatively simple musical elements, the words are dark.  Billie Jean is telling Michael that he is the father of her baby.  Michael is denying that he is the father, and further says that it was just a fling, but mostly to himself, he's not talking directly to her.  Certainly a sobering song given that most of the remaining songs on this CD are love songs.<br />Most of the other songs on this CD deal with women and relationships.  Most were classics the instant they went onto this CD, some more so than others.  The duet with Paul McCartney, \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", was recorded when Michael and Paul were best of friends.  A good, mellow video went with this particular song, which was very popular in the 80s.<br />The electronic instrumentation and the complex vocals of \\"Human Nature\\" were musical high points in the 80s that few others were able to approach much less match.  \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) is a musically simpler song, bordering on bubble gum, but Michael Jackson was unstoppable at this point, and the song has such a good beat that it's hard to ignore.  \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something'\\" also received a lot of airplay back in the 80s.<br />Because the original \\"Thriller\\" was recorded on vinyl, and was thus relatively short, someone decided to add a number of \\"extras\\".  While the attempt was a good thought, adding the interviews and the other supposed extras distracts from the artistic achievement of \\"Thriller\\"; this CD is one of the few pre-CD era albums where the album itself was sufficient.  I would be tempted to reduce my rating because I believe the extras are a distraction.  However, \\"Thriller\\" is unassailable.  Even if you are usually not a Michael Jackson fan, you can appreciate this art during an incredibly creative period for Michael.  \\"Thriller\\" is the only Michael Jackson CD I own, and I do not play it often, but when I do, I fall into the incredibly talent Michael has, and remember an era that seems to be receding all too quickly into my past.father, and further says that it was just a fling, but mostly to himself, he's not talking directly to her.

0679735909|3.0|i admit that i skipped a lot of the meta-stories, journal entries, poems, and the letters where they did not seem to further illuminate the plot.  i gave it all a chance, but it was really not as much fun to read the drier, fake victorian writing than the action of the main story, whose business it is to connect and draw the meta-story into it.  i did not have to read several long pages to get the idea or pick up the needed clues.<br />this is my first encounter with AS Byatt so i can't figure her out yet as an author.  i do believe there were a lot of jokes hidden in the work, whether accidental or intentional i cannot speak to... i clued in near the end where the phrase \\"motte and bailey\\" was used, and i groaned to think of the characters LaMotte and Bailey.  even though i have a university degree in english (and yes choose to write in nearly all lower case) and had to slog through rambling victorian poems there as well, i still found the inserts of the meta-stories hard to take.  perhaps if the writers under study had really existed, and if these were genuine works--- but then there would be no novel and i truly think we would be worse off for that.<br />it was good, really. just not perfect, nor easy to read as the author intended. i was not comfortable with the resolution and the assembly of characters near the end-- perhaps as page 500 was looming the story had a sense of needing to be offloaded ASAP?  the little hints and tricks were very clever-- indeed the whole piece seems to speak to cleverness-- and i really enjoyed the final images.<br />there were a few neat setups in the novel that i appreciated, looking for gold in the ore as i was, such as:<br />- the attitude of ellen ash's, re: disliking the idea of future readers picking over personal letters and journals and exposing them, which foreshadows her own sanitised journal, leaving one to suspect she knew more than was let on<BR>- parallels between characters, such as the pregnancy of the servant and that of another character; <BR>- the blonde hair in the watch/bracelet<br />the names of the characters were a bit outlandish, and again i feel some were deliberately chosen for their extra meanings.  a bailey is an enclosure, and the character maud is certainly aloof and unassailable.  a motte is a mound, and well, let's leave it to your imagination. wolff?  blackadder? (try not to think of rowan atkinson) leonora-- goes from being a 'champion' to a 'star' (stern). then again i suppose a novel about scholarly investigations prompts some of its own.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Don't you just love how [a certain company] automatically replaces words like [bad], [stuff], [female dog], [having intercourse], and [behind] with non-offensive words in brackets!

B000002P5R|5.0|&quot;First Rays of the New RIsing Sun&quot; is definetly one of Jimi's best ever. The album consists of an ingenious mix of released and previously unreleased songs that will keep you hooked for months. Classics like &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot; Ezy Rydyr&quot; are mixed with new great sounds (such as &quot;Hey Baby- New Rising Sun&quot;, &quot;Strait Ahead&quot;, and &quot; Earth Blues&quot;).Jimi's unreleased songs are even better than his released ones. This album is very unique and is a must or all music fans and Hendrix fans. Don't waist any time at all! Go and get this album and have your eyes opened!
0312243022|3.0|I liked this book but don't feel that he really brought the story, or characters together at the end, he didn't manage to finish the book off well.<br />What I appreciate this book for, is leading me on the read 'the original' Mrs Dalloway by Woolf, which is a far superior read.
B00008H2LB|4.0|When I first heard that Meteora was coming out I was like, &quot;Thank you god. Finally, a new Linkin Park CD with BRAND NEW songs.&quot; I thought Reanimation was terrible and was looking for somethin fresh and good, and I found just that, on Meteora. I qualify this CD better than Hybrid Theory, but bad in different ways. 1.) The huge dissapointment I had, was that the CD was only 30 something minutes long. I was looking for something more on the lines of 40-45 minutes long. 2.) Almost every song sounds the same and has the same beat. But oh well.<br />Overall, this CD is very excellent. If your looking for an awesome band and a great CD, then pick this one up off the shelves and enjoy.
B000063DHL|5.0|Everyone's got that special album that they heard way back when that would forever change the way you viewed music; An album that's closer to your heart than any you've heard since, be it bad or not. Maybe it was Dark Side Of The Moon, Sgt. Pepper, Moving Pictures or .....And Justice For All. For me, it was Somehwere In Time. I was nine years old when I begged my mother to buy me the cassette tape with the \\"robot guy with the gun\\" on the cover. Nine years old! The fifth grade! I'm twenty five now, and am still thankful to my mother for getting this album even if she wasn't crazy about the idea(remember, Iron Maiden were branded satanists thanks to people who based the band solely on their imagery). This album would change me forever. I had heard ...And Justice For All before this and loved it, but this one really opened my eyes to the whole heavy metal genre and what gems it holds. It's still my favorite Iron Maiden album today(barely beating 7th son, which I conned my mother into getting a short while later). Now, you know an album has to be good if it remains one of your favorites over 16 years. Most like to start with Number Of The Beast, and that is a great one to start with, but I'm telling you, you can't go wrong if you start with this one.<br />  Plus the song \\"Alexander The Great\\" can get you through a history report like it did me.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I can not believe how great this album is.  Every song on the album is fantastic and each track gets better than the next the deeper in the CD you get.  I have not bought an album like this since I purchased early Rolling Stones.  I loved their previous album, but this one takes the cake.
0805062971|5.0|Anyone who has lost faith in the medium of letters should pick up this book.  It's a fun, quick read, with a deep, dark, message.  It reads as fast as thoughts, and the language is used brilliantly.  It's also hard to tell where the narrative ends and the dialogue begins, making it very engrossing.<br />This book deals with with an ordinary businessman and the mysterious Tyler Durden whom he meets, and how they relieve themselves of typical American depression and anxiety by beating the (censored) out of each other and friends in the &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  When they get bored with that, they move on to bigger, more destructive pastimes that might very well mean the end of civilization.<br />Fight Club is a condemnation of the modern desire to crush the negative aspects of our life, but it also deals with many other issues.  The movie is good, but it's a bit too much of a regurgitation of the book's concept (i.e. David Fincher should have been a little more creative).  But it's still a good film.  However, be sure to read this book too.  You won't put it down!
B000089RVX|5.0|The haunting melodies mixed with the soothing lyrics bring a new sound to the world of music. A person can literally listen to this CD for hours without growing bored. Each time you listen to a track, you can discover something new. Great work for their debut album! If they keep up the good work, Evanescence will become one of the most popular musical groups ever to hit the music scene.
B00008H2LB|5.0|daymn this stuff is helluv dom. jus as good as the first one is. i hate all those stupid people that be hatin on LP for the &quot;reanimation cd&quot;. they all said it was bad because it was just remixes of the first cd. SO WHAT. its still good. LP is always gunna be good. my favorite songs on Meteora are &quot;nobody's listening&quot;,&quot;hit the floor&quot; and &quot;easier to run&quot;. especially in Nobody's listening, with the Japanese flute makes a gnarly mood to the song. dude if you dont have meteora i feel bad for ya, ur missin out on helluv righteous music.
0316096199|5.0|This story was extraordinarily enticing, my daughter and I read it with great and fresh eagerness as every page turned. This is a story that most people are not attracted by title, but the old saying goes you can't judge a book by its cover, especially The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold.
069452378X|5.0|I had a friend who made it a point to read \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" once a year without fail. She considered it the finest book ever written. While I might quarrel with that hyperbole, I do in fact list it in my own personal top ten. I, too, re-read it, in my case, every few years. And of course I was riveted to the brilliant BBC production starring Jeremy Irons as Charles Ryder.<br />Imagine my delight, then, when I found this unabridged reading by Irons himself! My delight was rewarded. Irons' perfect reading of this book opened up a whole new world for me. This time, I heard and felt the absolute poetry of Waugh's words--his ability to take his reader from sultry ... summertime to the slums of the Casbah to a storm at sea that is the perfect metaphor for the turmoil to come. Waugh never wasted a word. Never said more than he had to say. Never helped the reader by sugarcoating the story. And the result was breathtaking.<br />Maybe because I was listening this time rather than reading, I paid much more attention this time to the book's main theme, religion versus humanity. Can one exist without the other? Does one destroy the other? How far can one stray when bound by the \\"invisible thread\\"? Waugh's very personal and moving tale of upper-class Catholics in a Protestant country is a brilliant affirmation of faith, and at the same time, a bitter acknowledgement of the price that faith can exact.<br />I cannot say enough about this recording, which brings all the best of Waugh to the fore even more so than the written word.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes are now alot more expiramental and not as bluesy as their previous albums but, this album is still packed with catchy, and gritty songs.<BR>Surprisingly there is also some bass on this album which Jack White rarely does. To be fair about this album I wouldn't say that this is a 5 star album. I'd be more inclined to give it 4.5 but, since that wasn't an option I didn't want to sell them short.<BR>Anyway's it is definetly worth the buy.
B000063147|5.0|When writing a review for an album such as this, you always have a nagging fear that there are a couple things you are leaving when trying to convey the greatness of it.<br />Despite these fears I will review it anyway.<br />This album is basically a metalcore/hardcore album. But that's only the basis of it, they bring very many different influences into the songs without making it sounding forced there. They have alot of old metal influences like Iron Maiden, with a little Guns N Roses, and they also bring in some fast punk in the style of Good Riddance, with acoustic parts as well. Each and every track on this album is distinctly different from the next, creatively throwing many different influences into a song, utilizing brutal screams and beautiful melodies, while each member flexes their muscle in musicianship (espcially the drummer).<br />I could give you a breakdown of each song, but I don't think anyone wants to read that, but you should definitely check out their songs on mp3.com<br />This album has raised the bar in heavy music, many will try, but few will clear it.
B000000H42|5.0|Mercyful Fate takes the mystical excesses of 70's era Judas Priest and Uriah Heep, mixes them with Schenker era Ufo and douses it with Black Sabbath to make a masterpiece of Eighties metal. King Diamond sounds like a possessed banshee on this one, and his vocals are recorded to sound this way, to make just the right ambience along with the occasional keyboard flourishes. It points the way to some of the later Satanic metal bands that would emerge, and stands on its own as one &quot;hell&quot; of an album. Buy it immediately if you dare!
B00000IAU3|3.0|Not a bad album with fairly strong opening track.  But Thank You is definitely the best track of the CD.  For 60% of the songs took a bit long to build up to an infectious melody. Based on this debut effort, this songwriter can go far and would do better on her next album.
0064430227|5.0|Most people remember Harold and the Purple Crayon, and wont need to read reviews before buying this for their kids. If you somehow didn't read the Harold books when you were young, you will read many other reviews that say they are great books that have stood the test of time, I agree. The story is simple and easy to follow, the illustrations are equally simple, but the story grabs kids attention. There is something magical about Harold and his adventures, as he draws various things, they become real. It is the magic that sparkles in every child's mind, imagination. Harold is also plucky and resourceful, when he accidentally draws an ocean and falls in, or accidentally leaves a mountain unfinished and falls off, he doesn't panic, but thinks a way out and draws a boat and a hot air balloon to climb into. What a guy! The story is often humorous, a big plus with kids, but not overly so. It has a quiet and calm feel to it, and that combined with the fact that Harold gets tired and goes to bed in the end makes it a wonderful bedtime book. It is also great for young readers (probably Level 2), the words are for the most part short and not too hard. My daughter is a slow reader and has only been reading on her own for about 6 or 7 months and she read this with almost no help, I only had to guide her through a few difficult words. It is a lot of pages for a young reader, but since there is only one or two sentences per page, the story isn't that long. The book also appeals to a wide range of ages, it keeps the attention of my three year old, but doesn't seem like a baby book for my ten year old. I think it stems from the fact that, even though the story is so simple it never once talks down. Adults will also appreciate Harold, even those who don't look on him with fond memories. My husband had never read the book Harold and the Purple Crayon when he was young, after reading it for the first time he chuckled and said \\"What a great book.\\" If you've never read it, buy it, I amsure you will agree!

B00005JL96|5.0|I am very fussy about which Disney films I watch.  So far I have purchased &quot;Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Dinosaur&quot; on DVD and though I enjoyed them I won't say they won my heart over.<br />&quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; however had me laughing and crying in the same breath.  Set in Hawaii this is a very different kind of Disney film.  I loved it from the very first moment when Lilo tried to explain to her dancing teacher why she had to feed a friendly dolphin peanut butter sandwiches rather than tuna to the moment Stitch realises he wants a family of his own to belong to, this gem of a film managed to get under my skin like no other Disney animation.<br />The plot is quite simple; a genetically created monster escapes a prison ship and heads for earth.  All he has on his mind is destruction and mayhem but fate has something else in store for him and he finds himself pretending to be a dog in order to evade the bounty hunters sent to find him.  His new &quot;owner&quot; is a lonely but strong minded little girl called Lilo who is still grieving over the loss of her parents in a car accident.  She calls her new &quot;dog&quot; Stitch and gives him unconditional love, something this monster has never known before. Suddenly Stitch's desire for destruction takes a back seat as he tries to help the one person in the whole universe who is not afraid of him.<br />There are great scenes like Stitch finding a frog in the middle of road but it is him who gets run over by a truck and not the frog but as he is indestructible all that happens is that he gets knocked out.  We see the frog later on in the same road, and Stitch saves it, something he would have never done if he had not met Lilo.  It is a touching scene, not syrupy, just nice and thoughtfully done.  Another scene that is side splittingly funny is when Stitch steals a child's tricycle, jumps on it, grabs Lilo and tries to find his way off the Island only to be told by Lilo that \\"isn't it great, there are no cities on the Island?\\" Stitch faints when he hears this; he has been genetically programmed to destroy cities!  All of this mayhem and chaos ultimately leads to Stitch having to make a decision.

B00005BCPC|1.0|THE WORST ADAPTATION OF A JANE AUSTEN NOVEL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. THIS RIDICULOUS FILM DISPLAYS A COMPLETE MISREADING OF THE NOVEL FROM THE BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS WITH ATTITUDE PLAYING AUSTEN'S STRONG BUT MEEK FANNY PRICE, TO THE MANIACAL, MONSTROUS PORTRAYAL OF SIR THOMAS BERTRAM AS LITTLE BETTER THAN SIMON LE GRIS! GIVE THIS ONE A MISS AND READ THE BOOK!
B0000027DJ|5.0|\\"Trash\\" introduced me to Alice Cooper, while this follow-up solidified his idol status over me.  This disc has everything ranging from teen anthems and power ballads to a nod to \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" in the closing track.  A great album for the Alice Cooper fan in the early stages who wants a glimpse of a variety of macabre styles that maintain a hard rock atmosphere.  Also a great album for the classic Alice fan, to prove that time can not stop this madman.<br />NOTE: \\"Die For You\\" is #23 on my all time song list.  Why spit in the face of a heartbreaker when this song can do it for you?
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I own about 3/4 of disney animations.<br />Snow White is one of the oldest ones, but they really don't come much softer or more tasteful.<br />It's full of funny speeches, and the dance scenes float smoothly and the songs are very cute.<br />Definitely worth owning.
B00008H2LB|4.0|That is the three words that explain this CD.  I became a fan of Linkin' Park since the get-go and they haven't failed me yet.  This hip hop fan can now say that he has a rock home.<br />But there is just one problem with this CD....it's short!!!  The songs on this CD barely break the 3 minutes in timing and there is only 13 songs.  <br />This album has more of a metal feel than it's predecessor.  Maybe not many hip hop headz will be into to this....if you want that Hip Hop feel then get  Linkin' Park's Reanimation instead.<br />Overall this CD really holds it's own.  Just because Linkin' Park didn't do much hip hop this time around doesn't change the fact that they are a good band.  I am just lookin' at a hip hop perspective(which this group has gotten the attetion of respectively).  <br />This album has high and lows(mostly highs).  My fav' tracks have to be : Lying From You, Somewhere I Belong, Nobody's Listen, and Figure 0.9.....all good tracks!!!<BR>The CD is #1 on the charts for the moment and if you get this CD....you will see why!  Late!
B00006LWSF|2.0|Alright, so 50 Cent and Em are the most popular MCees in hip hop.  THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY ARE GOOD.  This album [reeks].  Except for Gangstarr and Rakim's appearances, this is a complete waste of time.  \\"Lose Yourself\\" is up their with Eminem's worst, like his irritating song about his mom, \\"Cleaning out my Closet\\".  I wish the hip hop nation would wake up and realize how wack eminem and 50 are.
B000089RVX|5.0|Every so often a female vocalist will burst onto the scene and everyone stops to take note...Amy Lee where have you been all our life ??!! The album explores both amped up rockers and dark somber love scorned melodies and Amy's tones are strong and genuine....you can feel what she's trying to sing...the pleading, the sadness, the yearning...its all in there !! As for the band, Evanesence offers solid axework and decent bass and drums...although the credits seem to indicate a lower billing for the supporting staff...possibly even studio musicians.  Anyway, the guitars are powerful and use the \\"drop in\\" timing element (made famous by Linkin' Park) to create effect, but they improve on what others of the day are doing because they don't stomp on the distortion pedal, preferring the raw, neat and clean sound to back-up the lovely sprite at the helm !! The piano is masterfully used as a lead in and fade out and is mainstay throughout !! This album rocks and crys and will drive you through rush hour traffic or provide you with something to think about while you veg on the couch. It provides a nice departure from what everyone else in the industry is doing !! And kudos to the producers for giving the listener clean volume...which makes it nice to listen at any volume...but most will like it loud !!  Amy's vocals alone could carry this album but the songwork and musicianship is solid and definitely worth the purchase.  Highlights include: \\"Taking Over Me\\", \\"Whisper\\", \\"Tourniquet\\" and of course \\"Bring Me to Life\\" !!
B00007BKVC|4.0|Thelma &amp; Louise is a special film in many ways.  Susan Sarandon is a brilliant actress, and along wtih Geena Davis, bring together the story of two friends setting off for a weekend away with the chance to leave their useless partners behind.  Things change of course, and it becomes one adventure after another.  What makes this film so special is the way the characters change - it happens gradually and is convincing.  Both of them become better people for their experiences. <BR> <BR>DVD SUMMARY:<br />When this film was first released on DVD, it had a very poor transfer, and audio problems to boot.  Avoid that orginal release.  The 'Special Edition DVD' fixes both these problems, and also comes with an array of extras that are too numerous to mention. I will say that the audio commentaries from Ridley Scott, Sarandon and Davis are a real bonus.  I can't recommend this DVD enough.  Just buy it, and treasure one of the best films ever.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Like most CDs I buy, I had to listen to this a few times to really appreciate it.  If you buy it and upon the first listen you feel disappointed, DON'T FEAR.  Take a day or two off and try it again.  I think the tracks are very powerful and thoughtful.  I have it in my car right now.  I have listened to it 5 times and I only bought it 4 days ago!  Its clear that Linkin Park didn't fall into the Sophmore Slump!  Give it a spin!
6305784116|5.0|This is a great movie for very young kids to watch.  It doesn't have any violance in it, and about the only scary scene is the &quot;catnapping&quot;.<br />It teaches kids to value and respect each other and don't pass judgment based on being richer or poorer.<br />A must have.
630463949X|5.0|WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT FLEETWOOD MAC BUT UNBELIEVABLE. THIS IS TRUELY A 5 STAR DVD THAT COMES CLOSE TO THE EAGLES &quot;HELL FREEZES OVER&quot; AND IS NOT THAT FAR OFF. THE TALENT OF THIS GROUP FOR SO MANY YEARS AND TO HAVE THEM COME BACK AND REPRODUCE LIKE THEY DID IN THIS DVD IS A EXPERIENCE. STEVIE NICKS VOICE CONTINUES TO BE EXCELLANT BUT LINDSEY BUKINGHAM DEFINITLY STEALS THE SHOW WITH SUCH GREAT PASSION AND THOUGHTS ON HIS LIFE AND CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE CONCERT ESPECIALLY IN HIS SOLO OF &quot;BIG LOVE&quot;. HE IS A RARE TALENT THAT I COMPARE IN THE DELVERY OF HIS MUSIC OF DON HENLY BUT YET RARELY GETS THE CREDIT FOR HIS UNIQUE STYLE OF GUITER PLAYING THAT FEW IN THE WORLD CAN DO. WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT MICK FLEETWOOD WHO STARTED THE WHOLE THING AND DELIVERS A TERRRIFIC OPEN MOUTH PERFOMANCE ON THE DRUMS. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED CHRISTIE MCVIE'S VOICE BUT I WOULD HAVE LIKE TO SEE MORE EXCITEMENT OUT OF HER DURING THE CONCERT. THE BEST WAS WHEN LINDSEY AND STEVIE SING TO EACH OTHER AND KISS AT THE END OF THE SONG. THROUGHOUT ALL THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS THIS GROUP HAS GONE THROUGH IT IS GREAT THAT LIFE HAS COME BACK TO THEM AND THEY CAN CELEBRATE AND DELIVER A GREAT PERFORMANCE. THIS IS ONE DVD THAT WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED AND WILL NEVER GROW OLD.. BUY IT ENJOY IT AND ESPECIALLY WATCH LINDSEY AND HOW MUCH THIS MEANT TO HIM BOTH FROM A MUSICAL EXPERIENCE BUT A LIFE EXPERIENCE.
B00005AR3G|4.0|This is my second favorite Disney movie (Aladdin is my first).  What I like about this movie has mostly to do with the slapstick comedy.  Not too many Disney animated movies have this much slapstick in it.  Even my (soon-to-be) two year old son laughs at it.  He loves when they show Yzma explaining why she &quot;has gotten into this bad habit of running the country behind my back&quot; (Kuzco's words), and they show a close-up of something that was stuck between her teeth!<br />Yzma has to be my favorite Disney villain.  Sure, she's &quot;living proof that dinsaurs once roamed the earth&quot;, but it's due to the fact that she has to be the most humorous of all the villains, other than Jafar from Aladdin.  Also, I think that Kronk is hilarious as her right-hand man.<br />I also like the character Pacha.  He didn't want to help the emporer in the first place (the emporer did want to destroy his village and put his summer home--Kuzcotopia--there), but he did it out of the kindness of his heart.  I always like characters like that.<br />If you are a big Disney fan, you should get this even if you haven't seen it.  Or, if you don't want to buy it, rent it.  I guarantee you'll be laughing!
B00004Z459|5.0|There was only one problem with Hybrid Theory. It left you wanting more. Every song on the album is good, most of them are great. This is something that is hard to find in today's market.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this cd is the best one out! i mean it has a nice control of metal and rap mixed together. vocals are just astounding, its like chester has 3 diffrent voices in one. the lyrics are all reality based nothing [unreal] about it. linkin park knows how to lay the music down, and they do it every time. here's my rating<br />forward- 10 nice eire begining <BR>dont stay-10 sweet song<BR>somewhere i belong- 10 its awesome<BR>lying from you - 10 great lyrics<BR>hit the floor- 10 metal the way it should be<BR>easier to run- 10 realistic to life itself<BR>faint- 10 cool chorus<BR>figure .09- 10 mike and chester tear it up on this one!<BR>breaking the habit- 9 this songs ok <BR>from the inside- 10 awesome song<BR>nobodys listening- 10 great rap/ singing song<BR>session- 10 awesome work on the turntables<BR>numb- 10 the perfect song for someone out of a bad relationship.
B00008H2LE|5.0|I managed to get the CD right before i went to school on the Tuesday of Meteora's release and i've never been so glad to be stuck in traffic.  I thought the 'Foreward' was fairly useless but seriously, who cares about that when you have 12 other tracks that will soon be embedded in your mind?  From 'Don't Stay' i was instantly in a trance.  Chester Bennington has that in-between yell that you can not imitate.  The messages of the songs...ALL of the songs hit me in the same way Hybrid Theory hit me.  I was expecting at most an equal and i've never been so glad to be proven wrong.  'Somewhere I Belong' is great song but actually one of the worst on the album (as if there's a single tape-filler).  Brad Delson has done the most improving on this album.  His standout guitar riffs are on every song, especially 'Lying from You' and 'Faint', not leaving a single band member overshadowed (which is oxymoronic in groups).  Mr. Hahn gets his infamous 'Session' track and samples and scratches throughout the album without diminishing the hard rock quality.  Mike Shinoda's verses are in its purest form, especially on 'Faint', he does not miss a single beat.  I can't really pick a standout track because they're all good.  Among the realest album i've ever heard.  'Numb' is the best track if i had to pick one.  Overall, Meteora is a slap in the face to the 'sophomore jinx', and for 36 minutes, you experience an already highly developed band evolving through your speakers.
B00005U11Z|4.0|JOURNEY HAS HAD AND ALWAYS WILL BE A GREAT ROCK BAND THAT YOU CAN PLUG INTO YOUR CAR AND CAN'T HELP BUT SING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD FOR JOURNEY FANS EVEN THOUGH PERRY IS NOT THERE. STEVE AUGERI DOES A TREMENDOUS JOB OF RECREATING ALL THE GREAT SONGS. EVEN THOUGH TRUE JOURNEY FANS LOVE PERRY , YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES AND YOU DON'T MISS HIM.  I CAN'T GIVE THIS DVD 5 STARS BECAUSE MY BENCH MARKS CONTINUE TO BE FLEETWOODS &quot;THE DANCE&quot; AND THE EAGLES &quot;HELL FREEZES OVER&quot;. HOWEVER WHAT THIS DOES SHOW IS HOW REALLY GOOD NEAL SCHON IS ON GUITAR. NEWCOMER DEEN CASTRONOVO ON DRUMS DOES A GREAT JOB AND THE OTHER ORIGINAL BAND MEMBERS OF VALORY AND CAIN ARE TERRIFIC EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS BACK TO THE LATE 70'S AND EARLY 80'S. I DID NOT CARE FOR THE ADDITIONS FROM THERE NEW ALBUMA &quot;ARRIVAL&quot; BUT THATS JUST MY OPINION AND SHOULD NOT SWAY YOU FROM BUYING THIS DVD.  HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME ARE &quot;SEND HER MY LOVE&quot;, &quot;OPEN ARMS&quot;, &quot;WHEEL IN THE SKY&quot; WHICH BY THE WAY HAS NEVER BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITES BUT IS WELL DONE ON THIS DVD WITH A GREAT AND DIFFERENT FINISH.  TRACKS 19/20 ARE GREAT AND TO END UP WITH &quot;FAITHFULLY&quot; IS ALL TOO APPROPRIATE.. BUY THIS .. YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED AND GETS BETTER AS IT GOES FROM BEGINNING TO END,
B00003CXGG|2.0|Funny enough, even though The Transporter doesn't feature the likes of Jet Li, Jackie Chan, or Donnie Yen in the lead role (the titular character is played by the delightfully cool Jason Statham, who could act circles around these guys), it's more of a true Hong Kong action film than anything those aforementioned actors have done in the U.S.  You see, that movie didn't rely on quick cuts, wirework, computer generated images, or flashy camerawork, just good old and often innovative bone-crunching combat.  <br />And much of Romeo Must Die lacks just that.  I can think of five action sequences in the film involving Jet Li, and two of them are too silly to even mention (the hilariously bad football segment and the firehose fight) and one of them is overdone by too much flash (the prison escape).  So what we get are two decent action sequences with Li and even they're not perfect, particularly the final fight with Russell Wong, which ends with hideous ten-foot, gravity-defying leaps.  The plot's also a mess, never compelling enough to work in-between the fights and director Bartkowiak completely fails to build up any sort of momentum.  The fight scenes come at irregular periods with an ebb and flow feel.
B00008H2LE|4.0|LP did a good job in avoiding mistakes made by many artists. When Reanimation came out many people said \\"Why remixes? Why not just release a new album.\\" I saw it as a stall job to pacify us fans and give them more time to work on this album. It worked. Meteora might not be as great as Hybrid Theory but is far from a bad album. The same formula still exists. Insightful angst driven lyrics, fueled by a powerful beat, rythmic guitar licks and Chester Bennington's rageful vocals make Meteora a CD well worth buying.
B000058T5E|1.0|Jeff Beck's new CD, along with his previous effort, are classic examples of a great guitarist  who has allowed  some mediocre &quot;musicians&quot; to destroy his talents.I can alwys spot music that has been surgically chopped up by &quot;PRO TOOLS&quot; computer programme. Jeff ! What were you thinking ? Find yourself a SINGER/songwriter who you can bounce off of , &amp; resume making MUSIC again ! This new CD gave me a headache.....
B000009VOL|4.0|When I asked a friend to give me something tranquil to listen to while I study, she gave me &quot;Moon Pix&quot; on tape.  Stilling and haunting, it proved entirely wrong for my purposes, being just the kind of music that makes you gaze off into the distance for long moments, forgetting where you are...Not that I minded.<br />Spooky and off-kilter, this album is maudlin the best way. Chan Marshall (is that her name?) adopts a kind of child-visionary persona, delivering an idiosyncratic mixture of surreal, direct, and insinuating lyrics that are enough to rend your heart the more you hear them. Her voice is husky yet pure at the same time, and she's at her best with minimal instrumentation, just stark vocals and a muffled guitar, sounding like the saddest, most hopeful person on earth singing to herself in an empty room. If you know what I mean...<BR>Nonetheless, I can understand why a lot of people might fail to see the weird beauty in this album, especially upon first listen, and it's very difficult to know whether you're the kind of wistful oddball this will appeal to unless you try it for yourself. Take a gamble and see.
B000002V1D|5.0|I go the CD and loved it, and immediately bought a cassette to send to my sister who was overseas at the time. She was a big DD fan in the 80's, but I wasn't. This CD proves they aren't just show-off pretty boys. I thought I was the only one who liked it!
B00001QGPS|5.0|Method Man and Redman are both incredible solo artists, but it's straight sickness when they come together to make this amazing album. This is one of the best projects either of them have ever done, which is saying a lot, they've both made Hip-Hop classics in their own rights (\\"Tical\\" & \\"Whut? Thee Album\\"). The production on this album is awesome, all the beats are sick, and the guest appearances are sick too (especially Ja Rule [before he sold out]). Every song on this album is great, but the one's that really stand out are; \\"Blackout\\", \\"Y.O.U.\\", \\"4 Seasons\\", \\"Da Rockwilder\\", \\"Tear It Off\\", \\"Run 4 Cover\\", \\"The ?\\", \\"Checka\\", \\"Big Dogs\\", and \\"How High (Remix)\\". If you're a fan of Method Man, Redman, Wu-Tang Clan, Def Squad, or if you're a Hip-Hop fan period this is a must have.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|T.A.T.U's debut album \\"In the Wrong Lane\\", is a no -holds barred, knock-out, inspiring experience.  These girls really let their vocal range rip and let their lyrics set them free!  The Russian Dou are slowly making quite a name for themselves here in the U.S. with their unique pop-rock style.  The CD features a sample of the Smith's Lonely boy-anthem -\\"How Soon is Now\\".   The first single, \\"All the Things she Said\\" is playful and empowering - have you seen the video - very cool!   With this CD we uncover the remodeled version of pop...everyone should check it out!
B00008GKEG|5.0|Mine came in the mail, today and I am very pleased with it. So far, I've only watched the bonus disc and the first chapter of the original set. The picture quality of the original set is about equal to the VHS, maybe just a bit better. But, the audio is easily superior. \\"In My Life\\" and the other songs that I've heard so far, sound better than even the CD's. The bonus disc is great. I wasn't disappointed at all. I didn't detect any of the \\"cold shoulder\\" between George and Paul, as I'd read in earlier reviews. On several of the chapters, the picture quality is stunning, couldn't be better. According to some of the dialogue, parts of the bonus disc were apparently filmed in '99 and maybe even after November, 2001, when George died. I suppose they must have used high resolution cameras, due to the advent of DVD's. My favorite segment of the jam is \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky.\\" They do it \\"Elvis style\\" and it's great. The chapter layouts are done very nicely. The only improvement that comes to mind would be if they'd \\"isolated\\" all the songs from the entire set, so they could be readily accessed. BTW, the running time is 11 hours & 34 minutes. Not bad for a total investment of [$$$]. This is a \\"must have\\" for all true fans.
B000000WCA|4.0|SPICE, one of the best CD's The Spice Girls made when they we're popular and very rare in modesto,ca....!!!
0761119752|2.0|A friend of mine once said that lyrics should be sung, not read.  In this book, Boynton doesn't pull off the lyrics-as-story, in my opinion, like she does in \\"Barnyard Dance.\\"  The rhymes do not flow very well.  Parentheses, while necessary on the inside of your favorite album sleeve to note lyrics usually sung by background singers, are annoying here.  They don't flow very well, and are usually not read by me for this reason.  The book just flows better if you don't read them.<br />It might have been better if she would have included a \\"Sung to the tune of...\\" at the beginning of her book.  But she doesn't, so you're left to figure out your own melody.  Which could be nice if you're into that sort of thing, but being a song writer, I can't follow her melody line.  <br />My son likes it okay, but he doesn't bring it to me to read as much as \\"Doggies\\", \\"Going to Bed Book\\" or \\"Not the Hippopotamus.\\"<br />If you like that song-reading style, I'd recommend \\"Barnyard Dance\\" over this one.  The melody is simple, and you can even read it like that square dance song Bugs Bunny sings in that Loony Tunes cartoon with the two hillbillies (\\"Don't you curse and don't you swear, just come right out and form a square\\")<br />If you're looking for a bedtime book, you can't go wrong with \\"The Going to Bed Book.\\"

B00008H2LB|2.0|now i admit, i am not the biggest likin park fan ever. I thought there last cd, hybrid theory, set a new page in music, combining rap, rock, electronica, and other elements to get a very new sound out. However this cd is normally supposed to be a maturation of the band, but yet, this is falling short of the goal. it will please the ears once, maybe twice, but the cd will lose it's flavor, like old gum, and it lose flavor quite rapidly. the cd has it's bright spots, but they are dim compared to the bar that was set by the last cd.
B00005JLKN|3.0|Having read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; nearly 10 years prior, I must admit I was extremely excited about this film being redone.  I was disapointed overall with &quot;Hannibal&quot; (both the book and the movie) but since &quot;Red Dragon&quot; was by far my favourite of the three books, I knew it was a no-brainer ... it would be a huge success.<br />Well, not quite.<br />Some of the liberties taken from the book were outstanding ... such as the opening scene where Graham captures Lecter.  But in a two hour movie, it was unbelievable that the screenwriters removed virtually any idea of what motivated Francis Dolarhyde to commit his acts.  This was a HUGE part of the book.  At least 10-20 more minutes could have been dedicated to that.  Oh, but wait, we had to turn &quot;Red Dragon&quot; into a Hannibal Lecter movie.  In actuality, he appeared very little in the book.<br />Now for casting.  Normally I like Ed Norton, but he was merely a stuffed shirt and barely believable as Will Graham.  This character should have been portrayed as more of a burnout and probably at least 10 years older than Norton.<br />Philip Seymor Hoffman as Freddy Lounds was an equally bad choice.  Freddy was an older, shorter, kinda &quot;greasy&quot; guy.  Hoffman just didn't fit that bill at all.<br />Of course Anthony Hopkins did his standard superb job as Lecter.  This makes the movie worth watching.<br />Perhaps someone who hadn't read the book wouldn't know the difference.  This may very well be the case and I would still recommend this title for Hannibal Lecter fans.  But do yourselves a favour ... read the book.  It'll blow you away.  And you'll see what was missing from the movie.
B0000029DD|5.0|This is for all those people who choose to write negative reviews about an absolutely beautiful album, take a look at all the positive reviews Grace has received....sorry people, your out-numbered.  If you don't enjoy this album, you've got some serious music problems.
B000002KBU|5.0|it's incredible to know that this album was released over thirty years ago.  joni mitchell has never stopped creating exciting music--thrilling her fans for many years.  though blue is not my favorite joni mitchell, it possibly is the purest of all of her work.  i remember her saying that she felt something like cellophane at the time of its creation...that anyone could see right through her in the emotionally-heightened period during which this music was created.  it's incredibly beautiful music.  it's incredibly honestly written.  it's brilliantly executed music.  no one can touch her as a vital creative artist.  if anyone wants to experience joni to find out what all the raving is about, this is possibly the best place to begin....  but it's only a beginning.  all of her work is worth pursuing....worth being absorbed and digested.  as i have said...three times...no one can touch her.  no one.
