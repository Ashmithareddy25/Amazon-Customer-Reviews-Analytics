014241543X|1.0|In all honesty, I picked this book because of the glowing reviews it received and the fact that the cover states that it will appeal to fans of Twilight.  While I wasn't expecting the stories to be completely alike, I was expecting to get absorbed in the main character, Mia's, world.  Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed.  Like most of the 1 and 2 star reviews this book has received on here, I just couldn't get lost in this story.  It all felt to try-hard for me.  The author tried hard to make the parents edgy and hip, tried hard to make the story emotional, tried hard to make the love story between Adam and Mia epic....but in my opinion if failed on all counts.  The parents sounded like complete poseurs, I couldn't really tell how Mia felt on anything since the story jumps from past to present so quickly and unnecessarily, and the love story between Adam and Mia is anything but epic.  The profanity was also try hard.  If the author has to throw in a couple of f-bombs now again to make a point, that's fine.  I'm not a prude, but in this case it seemed like once again the author was throwing curse words around to show how \\"cool\\" the adults were in this book.  And as I said before, they were anything but.  There wasn't a single character I liked in this book.  Not only would I NOT recommend this book to fans of Twilight, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody, especially not a young adult.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Excellent concert, how i wish i was old enough to have gone to it. Do not expect 2010 picture and sound quality (although the quality is very good), i understand that it took nearly a year to match up and clean up the (mostly)silent film footage with the audio. If you are in any doubt, go over to y**tube and watch thunder road from this concert, spellbinding.<br />Ninety percent of the few negative reviews concern the fact that Sony are involved with this release. So what i say, i dont care if lucifer is involved, its too good to miss.
B001VIRWA6|1.0|This album sucks.  Why would Chris Cornell belittle himself like this.  Working with Timberland??......If Cornell used the toilet he could drop some Timberlands, or Timberlake's.  Cornell doesn't need losers like Timberland.  When I saw the stupid video for &#34;part of me&#34; it had me questioning Cornell's sexuality as he was posing like most &#34;artists&#34; in this style of soulless, talentless, processed garbage.  I hope Chris buys a new guitar real soon because if this is the direction he is taking, defiling his legacy and his fans and making himself look like a clown then his career is over.  One can only hope Chris got warned by fans and laughed at enough for this garbage that he wont do it again, then Cornell and us fans can forget this ever happened.  The most retarded thing is Cornell saying &#34;This is the best music I've done in my career&#34; has he been deaf since the 80's or have drugs made him forget his Soundgarden or Audioslave days?!?!  That statement reguarding this album is repulsive and shows what a sell out joke Cornell has become.  Looks like he's doing a sham Soundgarden reunion now to try and save face and use to push his solo career.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I love Reese Witherspoon.  A lot of my friends kind of hate her, but I think she is comedic brilliance, and her creation of Elle Woods is just one of her many flawless brush strokes.  In fact, she alone takes this rather generic and at times reaching script and makes it one of the most delightful film experiences of the 00's.<br /><br />I see its flaws, but they are forgivable thanks to Witherspoon.<br /><br />Now, the general concept of this film is that of a young and airheaded hot chick named Elle who finds herself dumped by her boyfriend when he goes to Law School.  In an attempt to win him back, Elle decides to attend the same school and prove that she is more than a pretty face.  She meets lots of opposition in the form of a spiteful `new' girlfriend and a slew of fellow students who consider her a joke.  Instead of buckling though, Elle buckles down and puts in the work, proving to herself and to those who doubted her that her head is not as empty as they thought it was.<br /><br />Like I said, this movie is a lot of fun.  It does have its dry moments though.  I personally found a lot of the `hair salon' sub-plot to be rather dull and distracting from the real story, which revolved around the school and the case Elle finds herself working on.  The predictable yet tacky teacher/student scenario that unfolds in the end was a little unnecessary, but what else do you expect from these kinds of films.<br /><br />Predictable.<br /><br />Thankfully, amidst all the familiarity lies a fantastic performance by a beacon of light that just illuminates every aspect of this film.  Reese Witherspoon takes the generic airhead girlfriend role and turns it on its head with brilliantly constructed, multi-layered character development.  She has her comedic timing down pat, making almost every facial twitch a comedic affair; but she also understands that dramatic tension needed to make Elle a relatable and sympathetic character.<br /><br />Like I said, multi-layered.<br /><br />As great as Witherspoon is (and I really mean great), she is not the only person here who puts in a commendable performance.  In fact, the entire ensemble works really well together.  I love Selma Blaire here.  I actually think she is a sorely underrated actress who I wish would get some better roles.  Her doe-like eyes balance out her permanent `snob' facial expression that helps add layers of depth to her cold exterior.  I heart her.  Luke Wilson and Matthew Davis are serviceable `boy toys' here, but the females definitely outshine here, including the hilarious Jennifer Coolidge (shining despite her dull plot points), Holland Taylor and Ali Larter.  Victor Garber is always a welcome addition to any ensemble as far as I'm concerned, despite my reservations on his eventual character arc.<br /><br />Flawed by highly engaging and a lot of fun, this spectacularly acted teen comedy certainly deserves a place in any DVD library!she is not the only person here who puts in a commendable performance.

0802136834|4.0|I was interested in reading this since it covered all 6 wives. The first half of the book is Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, since they are probably the most interesting/most well known of the wives. I thought this was easy to read, although it took a while. Not because of the subject or style but that it's a large book. I think it would be difficult for someone with little to no knowledge of the subject to read this as it would be difficult to keep people/stories straight. I think Alison Weir is biased toward/against all of them and I'm not so sure the opinions are factually based. Interesting read if you are interested in this subject though. As for a history book, it's not boring or slow at all. I would gladly read more of Weir's work.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|It's a love story, I am a hopeless romantic! The graphics are fantastic and the movie is one of my favorites.
0307454541|4.0|My mom recommended this book to me, said the main character Salander was interesting, which she is, but she is into whodunits whereas, I am not. Anyway, I enjoyed the book. It's not entirely a whodunit and the solving of the main crime and the underlying crimes was a bit convenient honestly. It has some rough scenes, I would not recommend to those sensitive to such descriptions and definitely not to anyone under 18. I had a difficult time keeping names/places straight and some of the sayings weren't clear translated, but other than that it was easy to read. It was a good book, it was slow to get started, but took some interesting turns and I'm glad I have the next in the series. But truly I would not say that this is the best mystery/murder book ever or for decades to come. I'm not an expert on the genre, but I bet there is better out there. I guess my main disappointment was that things worked out a little too conveniently. And the characters are the coffee-drinkingest people I've ever heard of. But maybe that's just Sweden. I'll start the next one tonight.
B003274QH6|5.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\" is totally awesome. Who hasn't day dreamed about a taking a short cut to wealth? And this show depicts the pros and cons of such a decision. There were many times when I was laughing hysterically, although I'm not sure that the writers of the show intended to get such a reaction at all such times. Bought season 1 & 2. Can't wait for season 3 on blu-ray.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|It's real simple, George.  The vast majority of people who will buy the Blu-Ray versions are middle-aged nostalgia hounds.  These people will NOT pony up more of their hard-earned dough for CGI \\"enhancements.\\"  They WILL, however, whip out their credit cards for the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES faster than Han Solo's draw-down on Greedo.    Find your best exant print each film of the original trilogy.  Have the ILM lab boys scan in every frame @ 4k.  Do the LEAST amount of color correction and dust/scratch removal--only in a restoration sense, not \\"improving color\\" or anything like that.  Approach it like archivists.    Use your technical advancements to do the finest BR encoding of those individual frames.  I want to see film grain, dude.  Matte lines.  Pancake makeup.  Absolutely naked and unvarnished.  The final result should be a monument to the format, really.    Do the same with the audio.    If your ego won't let you \\"let go\\" of your CGI meddling, then make every feature a two-BR set--your best \\"improved\\" version + the original theatrical release.  You can charge more that way, have your final vision, and still satisfy the fans who want the '77, '80. and '83 prints.  And line your pockets with more filthy lucre as you sell the same product to us for the umteenth time.    Call it a \\"Special Edition Archivist Series\\" or something like that.
B002BIULQC|2.0|If there should ever appear a list over the most unnecessary movies ever made, \\"Hannah Montana The Movie\\" would definitively top that one. Believe it or not, but these words comes from a former \\"Hannah Montana\\" fan. From a objective standpoint, this movie makes a safe and decent family entertainment. Decent, not great. It seems as the good folks at Disney has finally realized that parents are ought to follow their kids to the theaters and has made a film that is bearable to them, too. But one thing is to make a film which appeal to all ages, another thing is make a coherent and compelling movie. With the latter, \\"Hannah Montana TM\\" fails completely. Sure, a coherent movie wasn't expected from such a cheesy concept as \\"Hannah Montana\\", but the movie also turns back to the series spirit and strips away the good components of the show; the likeable characters, the humor and the great music. Beware that there might be a slight spoilers below...    On the positive side, despite some slapstick moments, \\"Hannah Montana TM\\" appears as surprisingly more mature than expected, which is admirable on it's own. The dialogue is surprisingly good and the film has a few enjoyable moments, as the energetic opening, the shoe-fight with Tyra Banks, the Hoedown-throwdown and Miley's back-and-forward running between her dinner at the Tennessee major and her love interest, Travis (Lucas Till). The few scenes between Miley and her grandmother Ruby (Margo Martindale) gives the film weight and most of the acting is quite decent, too. Miley Cyrus may not be the greatest or most charismatic actress out there, but she has screen presence and pulls off the funny and emotional moments well. The most noteworthy of the rest of the cast is the likeable Lucas Till. This is a movie adaptation of a show where you don't need to have seen the series to know what the concept is about.    Unfortunately, the rest of the movie isn't much to brag about. In one of the interviews on the disc, director Peter Chelsom declares that he got this movie exactly as he wanted it be. Well, such a statement makes me doubt about Chelsom's visions as a director. After seeing the film, it seems that he haven't been sure of which movie to make. All the different components feels separate and doesn't flow well together as a whole.     Most of the humor is slapstick and is provided by the stupid and obnoxious British reporter Oswald Ranger (Peter Gunn), which feels forced and out of place. But with the exception of slapstick sequences, \\"Hannah Montana TM\\" is absent of any real humor. Jackson (Jason Earles), who's one of the funniest characters on the show because of his lines and charismatic personality, is only present to provide slapstick. Lilly (Emily Osment) has no a purpose on the film or has barely a funny line and Oliver (Mitchel Musso) and Rico (Moises Arias) has been reduced to cameos. Even Billy Ray Cyrus as Miley's on-screen dad, which despite the lack of acting skills provides a likeable father figure on the show, appears as generic in the movie.    The screenplay is based on a worn-out \\"discover your roots and get a better person\\" storyline. It would have been a nice lesson to children if the film had a final conclusion that actually made sense, but the unclear ending is one of the reasons that makes you wonder if this film even had a purpose. But there are a lot of things that doesn't make sense; one of them is the notion that no' one is able to see that Miley and Hannah are the same person. Yes, this has been pointed out by many reviewers, but at least in the show the notion makes more sense, since Miley doesn't surround herself with the same people that she does on her school. In the film, Miley surrounds herself with the same people all the time. How can they not tell them apart? Or easier said; How can nobody (even Oswald) recognize Miley's voice as Hannah during the \\"Hoedown Throwdown\\" sequence?     The film has several plot holes, but also with several subplots, whichdoesn't always flows in with the cohesiveness of the main plot (as with Jackson's subplot, which is barely present, but mostly ignored). At least Miley's secret gets discovered in this film, after the peppy running back-and-forward sequence. The mood fades and so does actually the rest of the film, which just feels wrapped up and just becomes incredibly sentimental. As Miley and her fellow casts funny attitudes fits perfectly on a frisky TV show, they just appears as extremely misplaced in a drama. Watching them on a serious concept, is just as seeing a bird without wings. And the several slow-motion shots comes off as superfluous and unnecessary.    And there's the music. One of the most enjoyable components of the \\"Hannah Montana\\" concept are the songs. Despite of them being mostly teen-pop, they're mostly catchy and listenable. But with the exception of \\"Let's Get Crazy\\", \\"Hoedown Throwdown\\" and Taylor Swift's \\"Crazier\\", the songs are disappointingly uninteresting and quite shallow. On the other hand, John Debney's score is his best work in recent years. And funny enough, Swift manages to outshine Cyrus as a performer on her brief cameo.    This movie was released in the middle of the third season of the show and could have been a practical way to end the series. But Disney has already ordered for a final, fourth season. So the question is; Was this movie really necessary? The answer is no! This movie doesn't add anything to the plot or develops it's characters! It adds absolutely nothing to the \\"Hannah Montana\\" conmcept and it's just a big waste time and money. And it's just a proof how far Disney is willing to market their products for cash and for what it's worth.    BONUS FEATURES  Despite of a mediocre movie, the DVD contains a quite few of entertaining bonus features. First up is a Audio Commentary by director Peter Chelsom. Most of the time, Chelsom provides an informative and listenable commentary. Although he doesn't cover up the biggest plot holes and repeats himself a few times during the track, it's still worth a listen, despite of his movie turned out to be crummy one (at least for my taste).    Next up is four deleted scenes. After a 41 second intro from Chelsom, we get \\"Jackson: I 'm Pretending to be at University\\" (4:31), \\"How Are We Gonna Get Hannah Down to Crowley Corners?\\" (1:37), \\"Oswald and the Hannah wigs\\" (2:25) and \\"Oswald, the Ostrich and the Alligator\\" (1:20). All of these clips has brief intro's by Chelsom, which tells about why they got deleted. With the exception of \\"How Are We Gonna Get Hannah Down to Crowley Corners?\\", which is a nice scene where Miley plays guitar in a hammock, it's easy to see why the other scenes were deleted. And if Jackson's subplot explanation was deleted, why did the parts of the subplot survived in the final movie?    Next up is \\"I Should Have Gone to Film School\\" (15:15). Hosted by Jason Earles (Jackson), the clip is a frisky and fast-paced \\"Making off\\"-featurette, which contains short interviews with the cast and crew. Despite a few misplaced cartoony sound effects, the short still reveals some interesting trivia about general movie making and Earles' sympathetic personality makes the short an overall interesting watch.    \\"Find Your Way Back Home\\" (15:00) is my favorite of the bonus features, which is basically a tour guide with Miley Cyrus and her mom Tish through their hometown Franklin in Tennessee (and a brief short with Billy Ray Cyrus bragging about Tennessee). It also follows Emily Osment (Lilly) in her hometown LA. A quite cute and energetic featurette, although is clearly that young Cyrus provides more energy and personality on-screen than Osment, which makes Cyrus' segments more enjoyable (at least for my taste)s.    The disc also includes a typical outtakes (3:48), Miley Cyrus' music video for the hit song \\"The Climb\\" (3:52) and \\"Blu Ray is Suite\\" (4:45) with Cole and Dylan Sprouse (from \\"The Suite Life\\" series), which is about Blu ray discs in general and seems to be an obligatory segment in every current Disney DVD/blu ray.    The \\"Hoedown Throwdown Experience\\" (14:39) is only available on the Blu ray Edition. The first five minutes are brief interviews with the cast and crew about the Hoedown Throwdown dance. Then we follow choreographer Jamal Sims and actors Mitchel Musso (Oliver) and Moises Arias (Rico) doing the dance step by step. A quite fun video and quite easy to follow.    In addition to \\"The Climb\\", the Blu-ray also includes several music videos; Billy Ray Cyrus' \\"Back To Tennessee\\" (4:22), Taylor Swift's \\"Crazier\\" (3:15), Hannah Montana's \\"Let's Get Crazy\\" (2:59), Rascal Flats' \\"Bless this Broken Road\\" (4:17), plus the movie sequences of \\"The Climb\\" (4:06) and \\"You'll Always Find the Way Back Home\\" (3:51). Why the latter numbers were included as  segments in the Video section, is a remarkable question, considering that the numbers can already be seen in the final movie. Otherwise, with the exception of the former version of \\"The Climb\\" and \\"Back to Tennessee\\", the videos are in High Definition and includes several clips from the film.     OVERALL REVIEW    The blu ray provides a nice, clear picture and a sharp sound. The Bonus features are overall mostly enjoyable, but unfortunately the same can't be said about the movie itself - at least for my taste. Perhaps Chelsom had the time of his life by making this film (as he stated in the Audio Commentary), but I didn't had the time of my life by watching this movie, which could have been better if it were in the hands of an other director. So it all depends on what you're looking for; If you're looking for a film to please the Hannah fans, this movie is a success. If you're looking for a G-rated film that the whole family can watch safely together, this movie will fit the bill. But if you're looking for a movie adaption which is equal to it's series, \\"Hannah Montana TM\\" may disappoint. Although most of the Hannah fans has warmly embraced this movie, my suggestion is rather to check out the show, you'll have more fun watching that.
0307588335|5.0|I enjoy reading some of the earlier reviews, particularly the poorer ones, where some former Lehman Managing Director makes claim that the details are horse****.  Over time now we have seen time and time again the truth's unfold, or \\"unFuld\\" as the emperor has been defrocked. Perhaps those MD's who so characterize themselves in the same mold as Dick Fuld and have panned the book are best served to read a few selections from Hans Christian Andersen, as the Emperor had no clothes, and Larry MacDonald the once \\"Ugly Ducking\\" has stepped forward as the prodigal Swan to tell the tell of Lehman.

030726839X|5.0|Decades following his death, Winston S. Churchill (WSC) continues to fascinate historians and attract various pundits hoping to make a critical imprint on the landscape of modern moral relativism.  His detractors attempt to belittle his many accomplishments by framing them in the context of his many inconsistencies and, failing that, sometimes resort to ad hominem attacks (\\"alcoholic\\" being prominent amongst them).  Recently, at least three major military historians, John Keegan, Carlo D'Este and Max Hastings, have written focused biographies of WSC in his capacity as \\"warlord\\".  Keegan's book is essentially a monograph (interesting, nonetheless).  D'Este wrote a somewhat more encyclopaedic book (WSC's entire military career).  Hastings concentrates on WSC as British supreme commander during the years of the Second World War.  While all three books are good, Hastings' penetrating assessments and candid observations on the protagonist and those who enter his orbit make for more enjoyable reading.<br /><br />Hastings nominally begins his story in 1939, the year Great Britain joined France in declaring war on Hitler's Germany.  However, necessary historical context from pre-war years is also provided, allowing this book to be read independently of any other biography or study. Despite the book's apparently narrow focus, it can be read without background or understanding of the War, itself.<br /><br />Not too surprisingly to his more strident critics, WSC made many minor and several major errors in his capacity as wartime Prime Minister.  He had a penchant for \\"meddling\\" in military affairs, one shared with at least Stalin and Hitler.  In common with Hitler, WSC had actual front-line combat experience and, also in common with Hitler, demonstrated bravery in battle.  Despite first-hand experience with war and direct, personal knowledge of the consequences of leadership error, both men were fond of audacious and risky enterprises, often-times creating consternation in the ranks of their professional military consultants, sometimes with lamentable results.  Hastings unfavorably contrasts the British military with its German counterpart throughout the book, with the British falling far short of their adversaries in professionalism, skill, dedication, improvisation, equipment, strategy and battlefield tactics.  For that matter, Hastings made the same unfavorable comparison of American troops to the Germans in \\"Overlord\\", his history of the D-Day invasion.<br /><br />In order to understand the relatively dismal performance of the British Army (in particular), Hastings provides many examples of the incompetence and timidity of the major British commanders who repeatedly come up short in comparison to their North African theater adversary, Rommel and their foe in Italy, Kesselring.  However, even their American counterparts seemed to view them with dismissive attitudes.  On the British home front, morale was undermined by the seemingly interminable duration of the war, pro-Soviet attitudes of many workers (and their \\"betters\\" in the governing classes), residual exhaustion from the labors of the First World War and concerns regarding the post-war course of their nation.  Hastings repeatedly emphasizes that, almost single-handedly, WSC provided the leadership example required to sustain the war effort from its earliest years (when the situation seemed most hopeless) through its overly long finale, when the population seemed no longer able or interested in sustaining the effort.<br /><br />WSC is both lauded and attacked. His penchant for dramatic forays by small \\"elite\\" units (which proliferated under his leadership) were generally unsuccessful (1942 Dieppe raid, for example).  His emphasis on the Mediterranean theater was distracting from the major war effort.  His repeated solicitations to the Americans on behalf of various \\"pet projects\\" became distracting and then annoying.  Nonetheless, WSC had an over-arching and penetrating understanding of grand strategy and, in service to that understanding, was able to bury his antipathy to Communism recognizing that the contributions of the USSR were arch-critical to the defeat of the Nazi armies. Perhaps the most damning (from both the perspective of Roosevelt's U.S. and from Hastings, himself) was WSC's fealty to the concept of the British Empire.  Perceptions that many of Britain's military plans and perspectives were undertaken in service of post-war imperial ambitions soured relations between the Western powers, especially on the U.S. domestic front.<br /><br />From my perspective, Hastings makes his greatest contribution both in this book and in \\"Retribution\\" (the Pacific War) by clarifying many now controversial wartime actions such as the use of atomic weapons (\\"Retribution\\") and \\"area bombing\\" (both theaters of war).  WSC was personally conflicted and committed some of his thoughts to paper.  Still, he observed that, \\"Morale is a legitimate military target\\" and advocated bombing of German cities not only for that reason (in the early war years to prop up home-front morale) but to convince Stalin that the British were making a meaningful \\"second front\\" contribution.  Hastings also notes that contemporary technology did not allow \\"precision bombing\\" or anything even remotely approaching that concept.  Hence, to target factories and military installations, area bombing was necessary. In Hastings' words, \\"In addressing the history of the Second World War, it is necessary to recognise the huge moral compromises forced upon the nations fighting under the banner of democracy and freedom.  Britain, and subsequently America, strove for the triumph of these admirable principles wherever the could be secured-with sometimes embarrassing exceptions of the European overseas empires.  But again and again, hard things had to be done which breached faith with any definition of absolute good.  If this is true of politics at all times, it was especially so between 1939 and 1945...the moral and material price of destroying Hitler was high...\\". In \\"Retribution\\", Hastings commented that, \\"But in an imperfect world, it seems unrealistic to expect that any combatant in a war will grant adversaries conspicuously better treatment than his own people receive at their hands\\".  This all rings true and does much to undermine the \\"post-modern\\" moral relativism which is currently fashionable. Hastings also repeatedly emphasizes that the Hitler War was won largely due to the efforts and exertions of Stalin's USSR: the role of Lend Lease and the significance of the D-Day landing have been over-amplified with the passage of time.<br /><br />In summary, Hastings characterizes WSC as, \\"...one of the greatest actors upon the stage of affairs the world has ever known...If his leadership through the Second World War was imperfect, it is certain that no other British ruler in history has matched his direction of the nation in peril..\\"  Certainly, WSC was the greatest statesman of the modern era and his \\"grand vision\\" enabled the eventual defeat of Hitler, cementing as it did a roiled domestic constituency and contentious allies.  His \\"anachronistic delusions\\" (sometimes making him appear to FDR and others as a \\"traveler from an antique land\\") about the future of the British Empire were just that.  His magnificent accomplishments dwarf his strategic shortcomings and can only serve as an example to be emulated by any current or future leader with pretensions to greatness.ding of grand strategy and, in service to that understanding, was able to bury his antipathy to Communism recognizing that the contributions of the USSR were arch-critical to the defeat of the Nazi armies.

0812973992|5.0|I'll start by saying, I've written a book. It's unpublished, I don't know what steps to take in order to get it published, and myself, and anyone who has read it love the weight of my book, it's not a game changer, just a good story. Then I read a book such as this, &quot;Let The Great World Spin&quot; is a humbling beautiful reminder of what story telling should be, the language it should be told in, and how things are supposed to be done when and if done right. A style of writing that isn't so much new, and isn't so much old. It fits right in between, right in between Amy Hampel and Khalid Hossieni. And in there, it finds it's own style, a style that writers that are better than me and worse than me will attempt to copy. Some of us will achieve it, some of us will deny that were striving for it, but in a way every single one of us will fail, no matter how far from the acorn tree we fall. Every detail, fits perfect, like your in the room with someone that just told you that they're cheating on you, but instead of scream and cry, no notice that they have freckle's on their nose, and that the clock is different than your watch's time.

B002UXRGLG|5.0|Having watched parts of this on Discovery Channel, I was worried when I first heard that Oprah was the narrator, and upon actually watching it with her narrating, my assumptions of it being horrible were true. While I do realize there are two versions of the DVD the original, with David Attenborough, who did the series Planet Earth, and then the other version with Miss Oprha Winfrie. Now, the Oprah version, she does a good job, and for a classroom or children it's fine, but I don't like people talking to me like I'm a child, and thoughout the entire episode, that's the exact feeling one gets. Even if given the same dialouge, Oprah makes you feel like a child while David makes you feel like an adult. If you've seen the Oprah version, I'm sure you understand. Now, that aside, Life continues to amaze me, having only watched disc 1 thus far it's the most amazing, breath taking series ever captured, people put their lives and albeit marragies and families on the line to create these and I think the end result it something they should be proud of that will stand the test of time. Planet Earth and Life stand as the AD. While everything else made before, as I remember watching Discovery channel before, will always stand as the BC.<br /><br />Something people should know, before they get their panties in a bunch. Life is more graphic than planet earth, it's bound to happen when you really see animals and how they live. So, know that now, some things die, it sucks, you wish the crew would intuppurt and stop it, but they can't and it sucks. Know that now, don't complain because your poor feelings were hurt. It's part of nature, you eat animals more than likely, so just accept it now.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|This movie, though targeted to younger children, is a great fantasy which many adults would enjoy.  Just seeing the glamorous Nicole Kidman playing the role of a villian and Sam Elliott with his trademark, slow and comforting drawal, made watching a delight.  I was raised on talking animals like Bambi, Buggs Bunny during the early Disney era and I found the \\"animals-as-people's souls\\", in The Golden Compass, quite more intriguing.  The script and animation of the souls expressed each individual's character very accurately.  Of course, National Geographic will give us the true picture of the great polar bears, but this movie endows them with a greater purpose in life than hunting and eating seals in the Arctic and raising their young cubs.  Adults will, undoubtedly, wonder why our own politians couldn't be more like the lead, warrior polar bear.  It is all great fun.  Can't wait for the sequel books to be made into movies as well.
B001FB5634|2.0|What a disappointment. Viggo is an amazing actor in everything he does, but unfortunately even he couldnt pull this movie out of the muck. The movie left me with many questions. How did they survive? Where are they going? Why would they leave a super stockpile of supplies behind? Why did that kid have to be so repetitive and annoying ;(Papa, papa?, are we still the good guys?). You would think that he would have had a much better vocabulary for a kid of atleast 12, and be much less of a sissy boy. Where are the books? Why arent they evolving? We must have fast-forwarded over an an hour of the movie, and still wanted our time back for the bit we did see.

B0000VD04M|5.0|It would be the easiest thing in the world to cruelly point and laugh at Z-grade movie-maker Ed Wood. So of course, Tim Burton doesn't do that for this biopic. Instead, we're treated to a more rounded and sympathetic view of the infamous director; he is portrayed as a man who simply loved making films, and who wasn't going to let his lack of talent or money stifle his enthusiasm.     A lot of the credit must obviously go to Johnny Depp, who infuses Wood with an infectious energy and optimism. Despite laughing at his cack-handed attempts at camerawork and special effects, you cannot help but cheer for Wood and hope he can make the masterpiece he aims for. Likewise, Martin Landau provides a memorable performance as the ageing, washed-up Bela Lugosi, giving him a real presence and sense of dignity. There are some excellent supporting roles too, with Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette, and Sarah Jessica Parker turning in strong performances.     Tim Burton really nails the look and feel of the film. It's not just the black-and-white cinematography, Burton really brings out the spirit of Wood in things such as Criswell-style narration and deliberately cheesy opening credits, as well as recreating a number of famous scenes from Wood's films. You get the sense that Burton is genuinely fascinated with his subject, and that he does have respect for Wood's dedication and independence, if not his talent. The film seems to long for a (perhaps mythical) past when film-making wasn't controlled by a handful of Hollywood executives, and anyone with a camera and an idea could just go out and make the movie they wanted.      `Ed Wood' is an inspired take on Wood and his films, and a very memorable one. This is an excellent, under-rated film that ticks all the boxes: memorable performances, fantastic energy, great direction, and most importantly, an unexpected empathy with its subject. Five stars.

B003ELOQCK|5.0|This is simply U2, performing, one of the greatest, Stadium Rock Shows ever. The Big Screen Above the stage, resembles an Alien Space Craft, that has landed on the Rose Bowl Stadium. The stage itself is in the center on the stadium, plus there are walkways, coming off the stage, that protrude into the audience. The Atmosphere is \\"Awesome\\". U2 performs at their best. The concert features songs from their \\"No Line on the Horizon\\" album, plus, their classics. Plus, you get some great, legetimate, human rights issues thrown in. The stadium is packed to capacity. Who could ask for more in a Rock Show? You will not be disappointed in this one, for sure. Disc 1 contains the concert, disc 2 contains the bonus material. All together you get about 4 hours & 11 minutes of footage. Thanks and Enjoy!!!

A superb all-time classic that not only helped to boost The Beatles' international popularity, but gave the fans another inroad to the Fab Fours' incredible loveable personalities as well. If you've never seen it, you should! Here is an opportunity to get it at an unbelievable low, low price. When Pauls' Grandfather hits the gambling casino, the s**t really hits the fan, and our story zooms into high gear! Fantastic plot line intertwined with The Beatles trend-setting, ground-breaking & unforgetable music make this movie a real winner! And at that price . . . WOW! If you're a true rock fan, especially early British Rock, you just can't resist! On a scale of one to ten . . . THIS IS A TEN THOUSAND!

B000W7JWUA|4.0|One of the biggest complaints I have seen for this edition of Settlers is that the border doesn't fit right. I had this problem too, so I tried to fix it by ironing out the pieces. It worked!    I set the iron for cottons (high) and used a dish towel to prevent the cardboard from being scorched. First I ironed the pieces port side down, sea side up for about 20 seconds. This caused the piece to warp significantly, but when I flipped it back over and ironed port side up it went flat. I tried port side up first but it didn't work out nearly as well.  Now the border fits together just fine.
0684857219|5.0|I have had a passive interest in weight lifting and bodybuilding for years. When I finally decided to do something about it this book was recommended to me. It's a little dated but it's very well written. Though the focus is on bodybuilding it covers a lot of fitness as a whole. The book is written with the beginner in mind using plain language. The various exercises are very well explained with photos, diagrams, technique tips, and suggested routines. There is ample information for advanced work outs as well. I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking to get in shape.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|We have 4 movie versions of Emma: The kate Beckinsale version, the Gwyneth Paltrow version and the 1972 BBC production- and this one. It is head and shoulders best the rest of the lot.  Obviuosly you cannot put every detail from the book into the movie- there simply is not enough time. But i thought that the writers did a very good job with what they selected and did not depart from the spirit of Emma- which spirit was channelled very well by Romola Garai in the title role.
B003LWXQ1O|4.0|I'm not sure that it isn't counterproductive to remaster a CD and then offer it for sale as compressed mp3 files.  Disintegration is a great album, the peak of The Cure's \\"big band\\" sound, with some of Robert Smith's best lyrics and vocals, and a cohesive sound that maximizes the band's strength at musically evoking a mood while avoiding the band's occasional pop excesses.  The decision to let the songs really extend musically was a good one, taking advantage of the CD format to produce a longer album that's still engaging all the way through.  As to the remasters, though, I can't say that I notice an audible difference, let alone improvment, between the original CD and these tracks, and these compressed files are unlikely to offer any revelation.  At least the price for the entire set in this format is reasonable.    The rarities--largely instrumental, as you can see--are interesting but not likely to deserve the kind of repeat play either the first or third discs should get, unless you like to host Cure karaoke.  At least you can select the ones you like here based on the samples.  The exceptions are the non-album songs, which are worth it.    The real treat here is the live disc.  The Cure aren't exactly a stage phenomenon on the level of U2 or Springsteen. However, this edited selection reproducing the album live, while slightly out of the context of the original performances, and apparently remixed to sound a little more contemporary (mainly Smith's vocals aren't quite as prominent as on the original Entreat release of these songs), gives a little added oomph!, particularly in the urgency of Smith's delivery.  He convincingly tries to express the feelings of the lyrics as he sings them.  \\"Disintegration\\" itself is glorious and \\"Prayers For Rain\\" is another standout but the rest of the songs hold up well in a live context and the band succeeds at delivering the consistent mood of the album in a real-time performance.  (Or maybe that's the production.  In the original shows, songs like \\"Just Like Heaven\\" and \\"Let's Go To Bed\\" interrupted the sequence and presumably the mood.)    Unfortunately, \\"Same Deep Water As You\\" just barely cracks that cursed 10 second barrier beyond which you can't buy the song individually, which means you can't purchase the whole live set alone, but again the overall package price is pretty good considering the number of tracks, even if you already have Disintegration.    In case you miss the fringe benefits that come with buying a physical package, the band and label have set up a dedicated website where you can access for free the liner notes from this release. It also features some complete songs from each of the discs as well as audio for an entirely different selection of rarities (albeit of the same mostly instrumental nature) and an entirely different performance of the album (from Dallas), and videos from the singles.  [After a deeper listen to the online \\"Alternate Rarities\\" selection, my favorite song on the entire set is the performance of \\"Faith\\" from a 1989 concert in Rome.  You have to hear it to believe it, and it's a shame that this song wasn't selected for inclusion on the actual release of this set.]

It's a bit off key at times, a bit distorted at times, but coveys his feelings of pain and loss at all times.  This is the one that lets us in on how it felt for him to lose people close to him.  This is a great record! If you're a fan on Mr. Young, then you can't help but understand what I mean.  Give this one a close listen and just let it break your heart the way great music does.

B003A4IFDW|5.0|First off, Bettye LaVette sure has a wonderful voice - all earth, gravel and feeling. However, as viewers of Idol and other programs or visitors to African-Americans places or worship can attest, there is apparently an infinite supply of black Americans with great pipes. What differentiates the great soul singer from the mundane are, for me, just two things. First there is soul - not the appearance of soul - but the genuine article. The myth that only black Americans can sing soul or rhythm and blues is if course as preposterous as the presumption that a singer has soul simply because he or she is of colour. Bettye has soul in abundance! Second there is the material. The songs chosen for this collection are an interesting bunch. Led Zeppelin to Moody Blues to Ringo to Floyd to Stones. I like some of the originals much more than others. Bettye makes them all her own and therefore I find myself really admiring her take on Ringo Starr's It Don't Come Easy, not a song I've played five times in my life!<br /><br />Some have complained that, for the most part, the songs here are slower than the originals; that there is an unfortunate sameness infecting the disc. There is some truth to this observation. After an exuberant gospel inspired The Word (from Rubber Soul) most of the recording is very slow-paced. In lesser hands this could have been disastrous - boring and repetitive music - music that you'd play once or twice and then discard. In this case I think that the deliberate nature of the pacing allows the performer to shed new light on the material. It's great stuff and I know that when I play it for friends they will turn to me (we all love this don't we?) and say \\"Phil, who's this?\\" I'll reply \\"Bettye LaVette\\" and they will look puzzled and wonder how on earth this 63 year old escaped their radar.
0553582461|5.0|This is a wonderful end to The Tawny Man trilogy.  I hated to see the series end and I'm still hoping Robin might see fit to give us a new trilogy with Fitz's children taking the starring roles.  One of the best fantasy trilogies I have read in quite awhile.  There were parts in it that brought me to tears, something that rarely happens even though I am an avid reader of fantasy and love the genre.  The interaction of the two main characters was so real and well developed I still find myself thinking of them and wishing I had not finished the books so I could be with them again.    I would highly recommend all of Robin Hobb's books.  Great read.  Begin with the Farseer Trilogy and get the whole story.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|This is very different with a tinge of \\"difficult third album\\" syndrome. Turner's singing style has changed significantly, heavily influenced by QOTSA, and I can hear The Doors, PJ Harvey and Morrissey influences all over this record.  It's a a sombre, darker album. Lyrically still impressive, but difficult to follow.  It will be interesting to see where they go next, but it seems the Arctic Monkeys are growing up. Early fans may well be alienated, but they may attract new ones.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Bought the Blu-ray version - don't know why it says DVD.<br /><br />I loved LOST.  I have never read so many articles, blog posts, theories, etc. about anything in my life.  It was a fun ride.<br /><br />Do I still have questions?  HELL YEAH!<br />Am I going to lose sleep and b&*ch at the writers for not spoon-feeding me every little answer(even though they promised they would)? HELL NO.<br />If they did, I wouldn't have had such a great time for the last 6 years talking/debating it with friends and family.<br /><br />Not knowing everything about every character and the island is not going to ruin my overall experience of LOST.<br />Also for people complaining about the explanation of the sideways/purgatory/whatever you want to call it...can you explain the afterlife?...are you dead yet?  NO!  So why do you expect the writers to have a clear and concise explanation.<br /><br />FYI - the line that Juliette said to Sawyer in the finale by the vending machine ... \\"It worked\\" was the same line she told Miles to tell Sawyer when she was buried on the island.  Think about that one for a second.
B00008PW2D|5.0|Probably the most controversial year of \\"Sex and the City\\", not because of the series itself, but for the fact that Home Box Office, the owners of the show, priced this season set the same as other sets, but with fewer episodes. Other season box sets usually had 18 episodes, but due to Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthis Nixon's real-life pregnancies only eight shows were filmed this year. Many have felt that HBO was really ripping people off because of the high-price of this set, but in all reality we as consumers can't really do anything but either choose to not buy the set or purchase it in order to finish your collection. Or you could purschase the \\"Sex and the City: Complete Series\\" set that is available.<br /> Nevertheless, although this season is short many stories are in full swing and the writing is crisp and sharp. This is the year, 2002, that Charlotte starts dating her attorney Harry, and continues to butt heads with Bunny over Charlotte's financial situation after her divorce; Carrie gets an offer to make a book out of her column and goes to California for the publishing of it where she meets Big; Samantha's affair with Richard goes south as she realizes she cannot trust him as far as other women goes; and Miranda battles being a new single mom and makes Carrie the Godmother of Brady.<br /> A fun season where \\"Sex and the City\\" continues to be as popular as ever.

There are many outstanding woman writers out there - it's a shame that writers like Gilbert are the ones who get the spotlight.

The picture is seems like a window and it feels like I have been transported to the locations I am witnessing.<br />However, Oprah is speciesist, horribly horribly speciesist. Oprah says time and again that mammals are the only animals that care for each other and live in social groupings even though on other discs we see amphibians and reptiles, insects and fish exhibiting behavior that \\"only mammals\\" are capable of.<br />That said, I bout it for the cinematography, so I tend to just mute the sound and throw on some music anyway.

B002XTXG1G|3.0|Winding Refn is a young, talented director from Denmark. His first movies: Pusher, Bleeder, are among my favourites. Bronson is below expectations.    The movie is dull, if not boring. Tom Hardy is great as Bronson, no discussion there, but I don't know what to make of his character: Is he a psychopath? Is he just silly?     Probably two things (and that's it) are worth mentioning. First, the opening scene. Winding Refn has created an amazing opening scene (a fighting scene) where the colors black and red dominate the screen. These colors (and the music) create an atmosphere that is difficult to forget.    But after this scene the movie drags painfully and boringly on. (At some point I wondered whether this was another Amélie Poulin).    The second thing that I wanted to mention is music. Probably this is a film where your dollars are better spent buying the soundtrack than the DVD.    I ordered the DVD from one of Amazon's European websites. It took only a few days for the package to cross the ocean and arrive at my door, the whole thing being very expedient. Indeed, purchasing this way turned out less expensive than having ordered from Amazon's American site.

B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Chuck is one of the greatest shows to come onto television in a long time.  With a mix of spy humor and action, (and a little nerd/geek atmosphere), this show can appeal to almost anyone looking for a fun ride.  The third season gets a little more serious than the first two but overall is still as great or even better than its predecessors.  The episodes continue an extremely polished storyline of the nerd-herder Chuck Bartowski and the dialogue keeps the humor intact.  Definitely look for this on store shelves if you don't buy it here on Amazon.  Awesome series.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|When you put Robin Hood & Russell Crowe in the same sentence, I'm there. Pleasantly surprised, since I had heard bad things. Maybe because, & I don't think I'm giving anything away here, this movie takes place before the Robin Hood legend we are used to. Also a good thing. There will be sequels I'm sure & let's get the prequel out of the way before Robin Hood II. In this version Robin fights with King John & that really doesn't sit well. We know that will change because King John at the end of the movie declares him & all his minions, outlaws. Crowe is great & never seems to have a bad performance. Cate Blanchette is classically beautiful as Marion, 12th century, landed gentry, who has had a hard life. Her man has been away at the crusades for 10 years. As history the whole thing is questionable. Historical events seem out of order to suit the plot. Richard the Lion-Hearted fares poorly. The sets were fantastic. As a producer Crowe insisted on shooting the movie where it occurred, in England, rather than eastern Europe, just to save $$. It shows he cares about this movie.
048640658X|5.0|Many consider \\"The Tempest\\" to be the final play that Shakespeare wrote solo, which gives a certain bittersweet flavor to its story -- especially since the main character is a sorcerer who manipulates others to get the ending he desires. Shakespeare juggled a trio of main stories before tying them off in rare style, but it's Prospero and his final speech that are truly intriguing.<br /><br />For many years, the exiled Duke of Milan Prospero has lived on a remote island with his young daughter Miranda. But when he discovers that his treacherous brother Antonio and his similarly treacherous friends are nearby on a sailing ship, he summons a storm that causes the ship to crash on the island.<br /><br />And like a puppet-master, Prospero arranges this as he wants -- he sends his servant Ariel to haunt the men who betrayed him, he thwarts the machinations of his evil servant Caliban, and he pretends to treat Alonso's son Ferdinand badly while secretly matchmaking him with Miranda. In the end, everything will be as he desired.<br /><br />\\"The Tempest\\" is a play with two different dimensions. On one hand, we have a simple story about a mage whose power allows him to manipulate everything in his little domain. And on the other, we have the story of a brilliant storyteller who arranges his own little worlds as he sees fit, and bids farewell to his role (\\"Now my charms are all o'erthrown/And what strength I have's mine own...\\")<br /><br />And appreciated on its own, \\"The Tempest\\" is a brilliant play -- Shakespeare juggled the three main plotlines nicely, and brought a solid sense of resolution to the story. His rich dialogue is stunning (\\"But doth suffer a sea-change/Into something rich and strange/Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell...\\"), especially during Ariel's songs and Prospero's speeches. Even the insults are brilliant -- just try yelling \\"A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!\\" at someone you don't like.<br /><br />Prospero is a rather unique character -- he rules over his little island with magical powers, sort of like a local demigod. Everything that happens on the island is because he wants it to be so, but he's a sad, benevolent figure rather than a tyrannical one. And Shakespeare sketches up an intriguing cast of characters, both mortal and immortal -- the ethereal, puckish Ariel and grotesque Caliban, the naive Miranda, and the contemptible trio of onetime conspirators.<br /><br />\\"O brave new world, That has such people in't!\\" cries Miranda at the end of \\"The Tempest,\\" and while not every character in it deserves a \\"brave new world,\\" the play itself feels like a weekend trip into a magical world.and with magical powers, sort of like a local demigod.

B002ZCDR88|3.0|I'm not sure if you kids remember Natalie. She is a folk singer from the 1990's. Her most notable singles were \\"Jealousy\\" and \\"Wonder,\\" circa around 1995 respectively. I bet if you go onto iTunes and check out those tracks, they will press on your memory button a couple of times. I think \\"Wonder\\" is one of my favorite songs of all time. Ms. Merchant has a beautiful and powerful voice that relaxes and booms me.    She released a 2 disc album called Leave Your Sleep in the spring. I like to listen to Ms. Merchant when I'm dozing into the night after the quarrelsome remedies of my days, and she tends to soothe my instances with her soft yet joyfully metallic voice. Leave Your Sleep is a collection of poems that were written for children. Ms. Merchant raised her daughter with these poems, and took 5 years out of her music career to make this album. She used orchestras filled with instruments and musicians from all over the world to capture these poems.    This album is not Natalie Merchant-esque for fans. It is quite different from what she normally has composed. It is beautiful music. It could make a grand concert. Her voice and the instrumentals give you images of forestry, folk carnivals, Chinese villages, Jamaican festivities, and even hints of 1920's dining music. This is definitely not a recommend except for a quiet night for yourself, maybe one to put the kids to sleep and teach them old folklores. It is beautiful illuminating music, but its mixture with children's poetry is a bit too creative.
B001IZGPJG|2.0|I love, love, love Enigma and was really excited about this DVD and really looking forward to seeing it. Sadly, I was so very disappointed in it.. the sound is so substandard and the video clips are naff! I am so over watching muddy coloured people somersaulting in water across a blurry, psychadelic, screensaver type background. The clips are so irrelevant to the music to the point of being a total irritation and distraction. My advise is to to buy the CD but forget the DVD.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|No offence to Ms. Winfrey, but this version is decidedly inferior to the BBC release.  It has 110 less minutes of content and less serious and intelligent narration.
0920668372|5.0|I love this book! I started reading this to my son when he was first born. He turned 16 years old a few days ago and this book is still an important part of his younger years. Yes the book is a little creepy cause when the son grows up the mom still sneaks in to rock and sing to him. But it's a story of how a mom and son will forever love each other and pass that love onto future generations.
B0034EGV6Q|5.0|I liked 'On Frail Wings...', and thought 'When Myth Fades...' was a step back, mostly in the vocals department.    But this one, I love. There isn't a bad track on this disc (unless you count an interlude). From beginning to end it's just damn good. There are no tracks on here (again, minus an interlude) that I skip while listening to it.    On 'On Frail Wings' you caught a lot of the high pitched, clean vocals which I loved. However, when 'Myth Fades' came out, the vocalist seemed strained. He tried to hit notes so high that they came out like a whisper and just did not feel right. On this disc though, it's just right. The clean vocals sound completely natural and have that unusually high pitch that I love.    The screaming side of the vocals are pretty much perfectly mixed with the clean. Most of the CD is clean, with a chorus or small part of screaming mixed in to change it up. In some parts, the screaming is dubbed over the clean vocals so you hear the same lyrics, but in the high, and growl at the same time which is done absolutely perfectly here where it's used. It's just an effect that I like to hear and it's never been done as good as it is on this disc.    Musically it's still Alesana, which is a good thing. If you've liked the music on the past albums, or even just like bands that are usually grouped with them, you will like this one. The only disc I've bought in the past year or two that even comes close to being as perfect to my tastes as this is Drop Dead, Gorgeous' \\"The Hot and the Heavy\\".    If you like this one, I would suggest checking out that one too. It's more screamy, but it's the main two that have been in my CD player since winter.    5 Stars hands down. Best CD from beginning to end I've heard in a long time.
0307346617|5.0|you've read the reviews. believe it. this book is incredibly original in style and story. it's also frighteningly good fun. couldn't put it down.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I loved this movie since I saw it in the theater.   Best Joker ever (apologies to Jack N, whom I also think was a fantastic joker).  The blue ray transfer is especially good.  Switching to between wide and full screen formats really enhances the viewing experience for certain scenes, particularly the over the city flying scenes which are heavily CG, but beautiful on this disk.     I thought my Bravia would make it too dark, but it didn't.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I'm quite fond of this show as I saw Pink Floyd live at Soldier Field in 1994 and it was basically the same show.     Clearly the most polished version of PF, for good and bad, and never a sour note.    I do feel bad that I never got to see the band with Roger Waters, but this show was all there was in the '90's.   That being said, they did a great job and were very fun watch.
B000U0F7RG|3.0|I DO like this series and have watched it numerous times, but honestly - the dialog of Lauren Graham! It's just SO stupidly silly at times - you can even somewhat tell in the other actor's faces how moronic it is. No person (especially a 'business' person) would act like this! The mother/daughter connection is sweet however. A little of this nonsense goes a long, LONG way! If it wasn't for Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop in the cast, I doubt I would have watched much.
B000RW3VD4|5.0|This is my favorite movie of the 80's (sci-fi excluded).    It really puts me back in time, and totally captures the essence of the decade.   Am I excited to see a sequel?   Yes and no.   Yes, because I love this story, and I hope a sequel will properly expand the story.  No, as most sequels stink, Shia leaves me cold, and the trailer was.....weak.      The original WS is a near perfect movie depicting the decadence and greed of the people running wall street in the 80's, and is perhaps a lesson to us living in 2010 as to what can happen when greed has no limits.
B00000DHRX|4.0|I would have given five stars to this collection of George Michael music if it had included some of his hits with the pop duo group, \\"Wham,\\" from the 1980s like \\"Last Christmas\\" and \\"Freedom version\\" and others that I remember like \\"Wake me up before you go go.\\" Just because he went solo doesn't mean he can forget those Wham years. He was really instrumental in making a Wham success. Maybe he couldn't get the rights to the music but his rendition of \\"Last Christmas\\" and his Wham songs are worth listening too.     During the Wham years, the music was mellow and shallow but his musical career matured after he went solo. His songs on this collection like \\"Praying for Time,\\" \\"Freedom,\\" \\"Careless Whisper,\\" and his duets with Aretha Franklin and Sir Elton John and the song, \\"Somebody to Love\\" with Queen are fantastic but I still miss his Wham songs which would have earned five stars easy.

0307454541|1.0|This was the most slow moving book I have ever read!!!  The only reason why I kept reading was because of the good ratings this book received.  I will not be reading any other of the books in this series.
B003ELOQD4|1.0|I had high expectations for this Blu-ray release, but now having seen it I was very disappointed. There's nothing wrong with the concert, production values, performance, etc. but the video quality was atrocious. It was not at all what I thought I'd get. I guess I was spoiled I just got through watching Foo Fighters live at Wembley (a reference Blu-Ray DVD)and that Blu-Ray was spectacular for clarity and detail. That's what I thought I'd get with U2, but no, it looks like a regular ole DVD. Too bad, a great opportunity missed.
030726999X|5.0|The only thing wrong with this book is that it is the last one.  These three books were all so good and this one was no exception.  It is more of the same - complicated and clever plot, lots of characters, etc.  Needless to say, it is a page turner.  I should have read it to slower so I could have savored it more.
B003NS5L8W|5.0|This movie was great.  I am flummoxed by all the negative reviews.  The instant I saw it was available for purchase I bought it - I didnt even think twice.  The only way it could be better is if there were more interaction between Will Smith and Kenneth Branagh.  Their interplay and dialogue totally steals the movie and is a piece of comedic cinema history.  They were delightful together and are two of my favourite actors, as is Kevin Kline.  Selma I have never had much use for; basically she's talent-free and nothing more than cinematic T&A, which is also the role she plays in this film, so no surprise there.  She has always been a non-entity and adds nothing to the film whatsoever, which is a shame, because it would have been nice to have a good female character.  Put someone like Madeleine Kahn or Bernadette Peters in a role like this and it would have been pants-wettingly funny material.  Mel Brooks seems to be the only director who understands how to cast women in comedies.<br /><br />Another reviewer talked about this being a Steampunk fantasy, and yes, for lovers of Steampunk (myself included) this was also great on that level as well.  This is not an historically accurate film, nor is it meant to be.  It's a comedy, and it's a damned good one.<br /><br />Seriously - I know a lot of folks here are putting the movie down, but they are wrong.  This is a funny, well-done, and evidently vastly underrated film.  Dont miss it, especially if you are a fan of Will Smith, Kenneth Branagh and / or Kevin Kline.  Dont let the naysayers sway you - give this one a try.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|My new blueray came with the original theatrical subtitles.  Four english subtitle options.  At least the northeast has the right copyies.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This was the first CD I heard from The Beatles back in 2006!  It turned me into a fan right after listening to it.  This is what you need to buy if you're new to Beatles music and you want to know why they made such an impact in music history.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|This version is a COMPLETE waste of time and an utter ripoff. What will Discovery think of next? Hiring \\"Shoot Em From Choppers! \\"Drill Baby Drill!\\" Sarah Palin to do a documentary about the natural wonders of Alaska? UNBELIEVABLY POOR MARKETING!
B002ZFQD0E|3.0|It is rather amazing to find such an almost unanimous score of 5 for any album. Granted the album is not bad and interesting at times but to me it seems way over-produced and whatever the qualities of Janelle may be they seem to get lost in the whole massively overproduced shebang.  I can understand that some could love it but quasi-unanimity?  When is the last time this occurs?  Myself, while recognizing some interest in the album, I will be a little skeptical and wonder if Mr. Combs did not mobilize a bunch of his people to drum up the beat (after having done so in the Newsweek article).  Sorry byt I need more than a reference to Metropolis and Fritz Lang to be convinced...[[ASIN:B002ZFQD0E The ArchAndroid]]
B00003CX5P|2.0|When I think of this movie I automatically think of a qoute from the movie \\"Fan Boys\\", in which after the troope' finally get to the theater to see Episode One they ask themselves...\\"what if it sucks\\".  Apt words were never spoken.  This film is simply terrible, It has \\"a few\\" good action sequences and thats pretty much it.  I love Star Wars, its my favorite movie franchise, I tried every way to find something to like about this movie and it just wasn't possible.  Like I mentioned this film has some good sequences and the sound is excellent, which is why I give it two stars, Darth Maul is without question a total bad a$$.  But like Maul and every character save Obiwan in this film he lacks any dimension to which the viewer really could get into it like you have insight into who they are and what their motives are.  They are simply strangers from the beginning to the end.  Wooden dialogue is a curse of this film that is also seen in Episode 2, whoever that film is slightly better in delivery.  The character of Obiwan is portrayed by McGregor who gives the character depth by simply getting above a monotone vocal range when speaking.  Most of the characters speak like grade schoolers reciting a local play for the first time.  The plot isn't terribly bad, its the manner by which its delivered and filmed that makes it so bad.  Seens are too big and deliver is too bland.  George simply overthought this movie, fell too much in love with special affects and disregarded making likeable characters that people could relate to.  Casting Jake Lloyd as young Darth...what more needs to be said about this performance...it sucked.  Worse you can't blame Lloyd, I mean he's a kid and if Cameron can pull Edward out of an arcade and make him credible in Terminator 2 than its something you might have to put on Lucas.  Simply the kid had too many lines, unrealistic delivery and simply no kids acts or talks like that and if they did, nobody would be able to stand him.  No wonder he was sold to slavery.  He's not the only one who delivers a stag performance, Neilson as Quigon simply is uninteresting and uncomfortable in this role.  Unlike the calmness and suave manner by which Guiness protrayed Obiwan and even McGregor does, Neilson simply doesn't have the knack for this kind of filmwork and he looks out of place.  These main characters like the previous...well not really...but sort of trilogy...are the ancors that hold the movie together.  It doesn't and the movie just shuffles from one uneventful scene to the other.  Dialogue being the killer.  George lacking a Han throws us a bone with Jar Jar...I wish I could throw it back.  Jar Jar is the worst idea of Lucas' career...worse that Howard the Duck and worse than cutting a shoe string budget for the special affects in Ewoks the Battle for Endor.  He simply is annoying and kids are too cynical now to enjoy his 50's style 3 Stooges humor.  He practically murders this franchise and there is no wonder he disappears from the remainder of the series save some bit parts.  Overall this movie lacks a simple story people can like, characters people give a crap about and fufillingness that people came to expect from George flicks.  Its a must own to complete the set, if only George would have let a movie director handle this and not himself...a special affects director.
B0039UTDFG|4.0|So unfortunately I bought the Oprah Winfrey version of Life on blu-ray.  The filming was amazing, the colors are brilliant, the music is enthralling, and it seems everything is good.  I was wondering why they didn't have the normal guy narrating the movie, he definitely does a good job, but I also didn't think Oprah did a bad job either.  In fact I think she sounds okay.  I am definitely not a fan of Oprah but I can say that the other people rating Oprah bad are just being haters. I believe that it is the same footage on either version. If you hate Oprah or think that her voice is terrible then I wouldn't recommend this version because you have already decided that you don't like it.  But if you don't care too much about the her voice then this is an excellent movie. If you are and Oprah fan then perhaps this version may be better for you.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is truly a wonderful collection of songs.  I have troube imagining a better gift for the fams of these two tremendous talents than Live at the Troubadour. If you rate Carole King's \\"Tapestry\\" album as a must have, you will enjoy this CD/DVD combo. If you feel that same way about JT's Mud Slim Slim and the Blue Horizon, this CD/DVD will not disappoint you. Both artists have respect and admiration for one another that comes through loud and clear. The music is wonderfully presented by two classic singer/songwriters and the small but talented musicians (Leland Sklar, Russell Kunkel and Danny Kortchmar) assisting on this collaborative effort are outstanding. Add to the great music the DVD of what appears to have been a magical evening icing on the cake.
B003ELOQD4|3.0|I was fortunate enough to pick this up early, but as luck would have it, that was not the case. The video quality is pretty bad; certainly not what I am accustomed to with Blu-Ray. Luckily, it is the same price as the \\"standard\\" DVD version, because they must look about the same. Overall, I am quite disappointed with U2's first live Blu-Ray offering.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Oprah ruins everything.  I sure hope someone checks out these reviews so this horrible mistake will never happen again.
B0037W68F4|1.0|So, my friend introduced me to the band MGMT a few years ago, and after listening to Oracular Spectacular a few times, I was very impressed. I enjoyed songs such as \\"Time to Pretend\\" and \\"Weekend Wars\\". As a whole, Oracular Spectacular was refreshing, new, and a great listen.    Then, this year, I listened to Congratulations. COMPLETE GARBAGE! There is not a single good song on this album and its almost as if MGMT decided to make the worst album possible just to make people like me mad. WOW.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|At first I thought this show was going to be a 90210 with fangs. Boy was I wrong. This show keeps you captivated and thirsty for more! The only vampire show that shows more blood I think is Tru Blood. There's only so much gore a show on the CW can show, HBO has a hell of a lot more leeway. It seems like its orientated toward teens, but actually it's filmed really dark and there's many adult-themed plots. Every single episode, so much happens. If you miss even 1 episode, you will be lost! I really like the idea that is unique to vampire lore about the lapis luzili herb protecting the vampires from the sun.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|c'est comme si je le regardais pour la première fois au cinéma !
B000GOTESO|4.0|Quintessential Stallone! The production values of this movie could be seen of having elements of action blockbusters of later years. Zinger One Liners that make these one man arsenal flicks enjoyable to watch. Coming in on #39 on Rotten Tomatoes article on Total Recall: 50 Most Memorable Movie Cars,   \\"Cobretti's Mercury  Type of car: Customized 1950 Mercury Monterey  Special features: Custom paint, nitrous injection system  Appears in: Cobra     Apart from relatively cartoonish violence, Cobretti's 1950 Mercury is probably the most memorable thing about the whole movie. Sadly, the car is completely destroyed by the end of the film.\\" (Rotten Tomatoes, 40 - 36)  If you want to see a great action flick, Cobra can hang with the best. Great 80's soundtrack.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Yup, this one is one for the record books. Truly stomach churning and occasionally difficult to watch. Brilliant special effects. Story is a bit wacky but that's not really what you are watching this for. What you will get is some of the nastiest special effects found in any mainstream movie.<br />Not for family viewing or a date movie. Highly recommended!
B00005NIE1|5.0|Awesome album and was delivered in a timely manner!  I picked my son Darius up early from school so we could eat Nerds ropes and listen to the vinyl all day. A+ item
B00005R24K|5.0|This is one of the best fun filled horror films made. Better than the follow-ups in my opinion. The original had a rawness to it that just was never captured later. This is almost a comfort film for me... I put it on and it's like spending an hour or two with an old friend. Filmed on a shoestring budget and very effective. Acting just great and fits the movie to a tee. Banned in several countries and in the UK until recently (available on release then classified as a 'video nasty'!!!). Pushed a few nerves in it's time and got the censors in a tizzy.<br />Good clean fun really and not malicious or likely to corrupt.<br />If you have never seen it, you should immediately correct that.<br />If you have seen it, you either love it or hate it.<br />If you hate it, your not really a horror movie fan....you couldn't be.<br />Definitely a family movie and a great date movie.<br />Can't go wrong with this DVD....very good.
0061537969|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I read it in one day and was crying at the end and cheering. A great concept of writing from the point of view of the main character , who happens to be a dog. I don't know about you, but I laughed, I cried, I cheered and I got angry at some points in the story. My reading group is going to read this book and I can't wait to read it again.

B000000OQF|1.0|Axl is a homophobic racist, and has a short temper.  All these songs are about girls, and nothing else. That would be fine if the lyrics weren't completely boring.      Slash is one of the most overrated guitarists in rock.  His compositions really aren't that impressive or amazing.  There are tons of guitarists out there that put out material far better than this, on a regular basis.     Axl isn't that bad of a singer.  He just uses the same tone for ever single lyric, and it gets old after a while.      The band's ego is so big it's hard to get your hard around. I couldn't believe it myself the first few times I heard them.  Also the album artwork is quite boring..     I would recommend downloading \\"Paradise City\\" and \\"It's So Easy\\", but the rest are over played, and overrated.  Also this album has a lot of fillers on it.    If you want to hear REAL music, look up \\"Pink Floyd\\" or \\"Nirvana\\".  Their songs are at least catchy and have good lyrics.
B003E48AYC|4.0|Having missed this one in theaters (partly due to the high prices, partly due to poor reviews) I was excited to finally see it on Blu-Ray! I've been a big fan of Burtons movies since \\"way back in the day\\" and was hoping the critics were wrong. I have to admit that I was disappointed with the movie and almost fell asleep a few times during it. I won't go too much into the story as the other reviews have already done that - this is a review for the BLU-RAY.<br /><br />MOVIE: While I wasn't a big fan of it, it certainly wasn't terrible (just a little slow at times!) - 3.5 / 5<br />VIDEO: Absolutely incredible (and since most of it was CG, that's expected -- it still impressed me very much, and I'm someone who has been a HDDVD/Blu-Ray owner since the initial releases of each): 5/5<br />AUDIO: Also very strong - I didn't notice any issues with it. 5/5<br />EXTRAS: Now here's where it gets tough. The extras are great! Only problem is that theyre so SHORT - 2-3 minutes a piece - there might be 45 minutes worth on the disc (divided into 12 features). These could have been fantastic if made into much longer extras. Sometimes they were better than the movie but came to an end so quickly. Not even a commentary! - 2.5/5<br /><br />I have a feeling we'll be seeing another Alice blu-ray in the near future (probably in 3D and with much more features).<br /><br />The 3-disc combo pack is nice - a Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital Copy (great for an iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch).<br /><br />Overall - movie was decent, video/audio were great, extras were lacking. I'd still give it a 4/5 - even if for just the visuals. If you're looking for a demo disc, this is it!
B0013N3DSE|4.0|to say the blu-ray disc of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD looks and sounds better  than any of the previous vhs or dvds versions would be an understatement. but   i do have one or two reservations about the blu-ray disc.     1.with the film getting a thorough high def up grade i expected the audio tracks    to have more oomph, bite etc.. than in any previous home video version but they    don't. you have to pump up the audio to a high number to get that just right    sound level. this is surprising since Warner Brothers Home Video also gave THE    WIZARD OF OZ and GONE WITH THE WIND thorough high def up grades and their audio    tracks have the oopm and bit missing from TAORH.     2.also with all the high tech digital technology available today one would think    the picture image would be A+ stellar in all aspects, but it isn't. there are a    few moments on the blu-ray disc that just don't look as high def as the rest of    the film. i don't know exactly how a high def upgrade is done but i'm assuming     they go thru the film frame by frame. so shouldn't every frame of a high def    upgrade look as high def as the one before it or after it?
1577314808|1.0|I could only get 40 pages into this book and had to give up.  I just don't know what to say.  Buzzwords abounded but didn't really mean anything.  It is a thick soup of spiced up phrases and ideas, but I don't really think they mean anything.  Reading a paragraph in this book is tough and the mind wanders from the lack of focus and meaning.  I don't see how this could help anyone in their own life.  Hmmm....Just a frustrating book and IMO a waste of my money and time (well 40 pages worth anyway.)  Would NOT recommend this book.
0385341008|3.0|Okay, I'm writing this review at the start of Part II (about halfway through the book).  Maybe Part II is great.  But I can't believe it's going to win me over.<br /><br />The book is okay.  Just okay.  And maybe I'm a literary snob, but it reminds me of books like \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" or a book by Nicholas Sparks.  (I would also put \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" in this category.)  They're super commercial and kinda cheesy.  I just finished \\"Citizens of London\\" so I thought this would be a nice closure to my WWII reading.  And \\"Guernsey\\" is a short read so it perhaps serves as a good \\"night cap.\\"<br /><br />Is no one bothered by the fact that all the letters seem as if they're written by the same person???

0307474275|2.0|The first Dan Brown book I read was Angels and Demons and I LOVED it! Every other book after that has been pretty much exactly the same thing. His plots pretty much don't change at all - only the setting and main characters. I've read all of his books so far (except the newest one The Lost Symbol) and I only really liked Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress.<br /><br />That being said, The Davinci Code was the most boring of all of his books so far. I only read it to see what everyone was so angry about. It sucked. Then they made it into a movie that sucked more than the book did.<br /><br />Very disappointing.

B00318EDD8|3.0|Ok ok, so before I get the hate emails let me start by saying this is a review for the Deluxe edition and NOT for the self standing Disintegration CD which of course is probably one of the best studio albums of all time. Five plus stars. With that in mind this is what you are getting. Three Discs, the first disc being the original album remastered. It's nice to get a remastered version but I mean this is such a good album I could listen to it on vinyl for all I care.  The tracks on the second disc are all instrumentals with the exception of the last six tracks. These are what smith calls \\"studio rough mix guide vocals\\" Die hard fans will buy this deluxe edition for these tracks. The reason for the three star rating... I don't know about you but i've never met anyone who goes around listening to instrumental tracks in which case here you get 14 of them. Um, why?? Especially from a goth band like the cure I highly doubt they would want some cheesy karaoke renditions going around. How lame is that? It seems to me these are just filler tracks to make the album more expandable. They did the same with \\"kiss me kiss me kiss me\\". Except at least here you actually are more aware of their dirty deed than the previous one. The third disc is the import \\"entreat\\". Which is a live cd that was released as an import except you get four live versions that were not included in the original disc... plainsong, lovesong, lullaby, and the same deep water as you. Most die hard fans will have already had this so to alot of them this is nothing new. Also i'm not a very big fan of live cd's when you can just hear the actual studio versions. If that was the case why would I go and see any band live. So to sum it up you are getting:    Disc one: album remastered  Disc two: 6 unreleased rough guide mixes  Disc Three: 4 live versions not included on the \\"entreat import\\"
B003A02W0I|3.0|The first Dan Brown book I read was Angels and Demons and I LOVED it! Every other book after that has been pretty much exactly the same thing. His plots pretty much don't change at all - only the setting and main characters. I've read all of his books so far (except the newest one The Lost Symbol) and I only really liked Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress.<br /><br />This book wasn't terrible but it was just as predictable as every one of his other books once you have read one.
B0016MJ6T2|4.0|This movie is great. Even better that it's actually based off a true story. The movie itself, is in great condition.no skipping or scratches.

B00005N6KG|1.0|These are the only head phones that stay on while I run or go to the gym.  Earbuds do not work in my ears and the ones with over the ear clips don't stay in place.  I can easily pull them out of my ear to talk to someone.  If I want to run for a bit without music, they hang around my neck without any problems.  The sound is great.  However, like another reviewer, I have had 3 break on me.  After several months, the wire connections break either by the ear piece or the connector.  (If I wiggle the wire, I can get a intermittent response.)     I have now had 3 pair of this model plus 2 of similar Sony products fail.  Why can't they use decent strain relief on the cables.    I am done with Sony headphones and will start trying other brands.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is by far the best movie I have seen in years. It is not only heartwarming but by being a true story, it can show us that there are still people who care. This is nothing less than a 5 star movie.
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown is certainly not God's gift to literature, that has already been well established, but if I'm reading pulp fiction I expect at least some semblance of plot. Preferrably, I would like that plot to be moved along by devices other than \\"Did you know about X? No? Well let me tell you.\\" And focusing on the Masons? Seriously? Didn't we already delve into that in that horrid Nicolas Cage movie? Give your readers some credit for having brains and recognizing the well-trod formulae at this point. I heartily concur with others who have suggested that you can your editor. However, if a real editor excised the junk in this book, all that would be left are tidbits I can get out of a Google search.
1401224253|5.0|If you a fan of Superman comics you NEED to buy this .<br /><br />The story is parallel universe story as Superman lands in 1950's Russia instead of American how things would be totally different. The art is amazing and the story is deep and self contained. If you haven't read a superman comic in years you will not be lost. If your a kid this will have enough action for you, but it may be a little graphic. If you are an adult you will totally enjoy the political aspects and historical figures represented in this book.<br /><br />The deluxe edition has a great cover and some extra art at the end and looks great in any bookcase.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|This is a great movie and the kids enjoy watching the bonus features. Great animation and picture quality

B000M5AJQI|3.0|A long movie.  Pretty good until the last half hour.  Then it's like, \\"How do we end this thing?\\"  Ending seems too twisty and contrived.  Could have been a four star with a more logical ending.
0385333846|5.0|I had always wanted to read this book, but never got around to it. I knew it was a classic book, but not exactly what it was about. My boyfriend told me a little and encouraged me to read it. So, I came to Amazon and ordered it, along with a few others. When it arrived, I sat down to read it and finished in a day or so.     The book is about the bombing of Dresden, Germany during WWII. It's not about it in the typical sense that a book is about something: you won't find graphic descriptions of the bombing, you won't read about detailed feelings of those who were there or anything like that. It's more of a...story based AROUND the bombing. You have to read it in order to get what I mean.     I do find it to be a great book. It made me think, and actually caused me to do a little research into the bombing itself and form an opinion.     I don't necessarily recommend this book to everyone. I don't think children should read it, or would even really understand it. Even among adults, there are those that just won't enjoy it because it's not their style. It's a matter of personal preference, I think.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|One of Will Ferrell's better efforts.  But then again...it IS Will Ferrell.  Notice the male shower scene.  It seems that Will Ferrell MUST have some homo-oriented  scene in every one of his movies.  Apparently, the guy is as queer as a three dollar bill.
B00152VWKO|5.0|This was music to my ears and music to my wallet. I thought I would not like the eco-friendly packaging but I found that it was very sturdy and easy to store than the regular CD cases.
0691142165|5.0|This book is prescient in so far as it foreshadows the sovereign debt crisis in europe following the financial crisis of the late 2000s. It's a very interesting read. I found the data-driven, quantitative approach convincing and illuminating. This is a serious piece of scholarly work -- it reads much more like an academic literature review than a pop-econ book.     It's not a story of heroes and villains. At no point did I feel like the authors were exaggerating their case, or sensationalising historical events, in order to sell more books or make the narrative more entertaining. There's just lots of really interesting graphs, and graphs don't lie (at least not as much as people). Crucially, graphs  allow one to pick out recurring patterns more easily than a historical narrative would. It's true that a story about high-flying wall street bankers, their extravagant lifestyles, and their role in the financial crisis would be entertaining, but it would not be very useful for understanding crises. Such portrayals cast crises as isolated events caused by the actions of a select group of individuals and their specific quirks. They don't help in understanding the underlying mechanics and patterns that contribute to financial crises in the same way that masses and masses of data going back hundreds of years do.     I found this book to be very informative, but don't buy it expecting an easy, or sensationalistic, read. I would only recommend this book to the sort of person who finds reading academic journals interesting. I really enjoyed reading this book and I learned a lot of really good economics.
B002SQ364Q|1.0|Having just listened the audiobook, I thought it would be fun to watch the movie. It was unbelievably awful. It's hard to believe this was directed by the same man who did Brokeback Mountain, one of my favorite movies.    The actors in this film were basically milling around mouthing their lines with little interest. Demitri Martin was terrible and so miscast as the self-loathing yet sensitive closeted gay Jewish man. The book went into his background, kind of a coming of age tale (a bit TMI but it made the whole story more interesting) in an age when gays were still so shamed and oppressed, and how that slowly started to change.    This was probably not a good book from which to adapt a film. I'm glad I got it from the library so I didn't have to pay a dime for it. After slogging through the first excruciatingly boring half, I did some work on my laptop while glancing at the last half so I wouldn't completely waste 2 hours of my precious time.    In my opinion, this film is one to skip. Completely.
B0035V35P8|5.0|Not for that faint of heart we get a peek into the secret world of the japanese underworld where violence rules. We see how professional killers are trained from infancy with the attitude that a job is a job and feelings must never get in the way. Above all else the clan comes first ahead of all personal ambitions and if you dont agree prepared to be hunted for life. This secret underworld then crosses path with characters in everyday average modern life who has no idea what they are up against.Betrayal happens, feelings get in the way and a choice must be made. This movie steps out of the comfort zone.
0691142165|3.0|The information presented was certainly meant as a textbook.  I am a little reserved in the acceptance of the use of the \\"Eight Centuries\\" title.  Most of the actual data is only from the last 200 years.  The author does state many times that historical data past the last 2 centuries is sketchy at best due to limited verifiable material.
B003ELOQD4|4.0|While 1080i doesn't take the video quality as far as it should have been for this disc, that doesn't diminish the overall product.  The concert is beautifully captured, edited and presented on the BluRay edition.  The special features are also very well done.  The only complaint I have is the decision to relegate the opening song (Breathe) as a \\"bonus track\\", which sort of breaks the continuity of the overall stage production.  The audio is fantastic.
B00005JLWN|1.0|I decided to re-write this review of Equilibrium since I thought my original wasn't that good, so here's a better review.<br /><br />I'm extremely puzzled as to why this atrocious Kurt Wimmer film has now become a sacrosanct moving picture, to where any criticism on it is met with some of the most vicious down-voting and imbecilic commentary that's only rivaled by really snotty anime fans.  Don't let this movie's jejune fanbase fool you, Equilibrium is NOT a masterpiece, but rather an extremely derivative piece of hack film-making made to appeal only either to those that don't know the foundations of good film-making or those that somehow think concepts in philosophy and politics override the proper mechanics of film-making.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />The story to Equilibrium is that after World War 3, the leaders of the world decided that it was human emotion that was the cause of war and created a society called Libria, where human emotions are phased out of peoples' lives through a mandatory drug called Prozium.  Naturally, pockets of resistance form up in this society and with the aid of a totalitarian police force, people known as Grammaton clerics use an art called Gun Kata to shoot out all enemies without much effort.  However, a high-ranking cleric named John Preston (Christian Bale), forgets to take a dose of Prozium and after feeling emotions, is starting to reject the beliefs of Libria.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />I'll be honest here and say that none of the characters in Equilibrium gripped me at any point.  I get that most of the characters are supposed to be devoid of emotion and personality due to the movie's setting, but for the characters that do show emotion and personality (like Preston), they're really hokey and clich&eacute;.  A good example would be Vice-Council DuPont, since he's almost like a villain taken right out of a Saturday morning cartoon's interpretation of a Stalinist dictatorship.  Preston's change into a \\"normal person\\" was goofy and his scenes with him being emotional almost made me laugh in how goofy and forced they were.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the dialogue in this movie is HORRIBLE.  There's plenty of lines that try way too hard to sound poetic and meaningful, but are also marred with Matrix-esque cheese that further decimates any chance this movie could be taken seriously.<br /><br />LACK OF TENSION/ACTION SCENES<br /><br />Any action film fan worth their salt will tell you that one of the most important things to have in an action or thriller film is tension.  The best and most common way to achieve this is to make the protagonist put fourth a ton of effort to defeat his or her enemies.  Think of Kyle Reese from The Terminator and John McClane from Die Hard as good examples of protagonists using creativity and \\"fighting for your life\\" effort in their attacks against the bad guys.<br /><br />John Preston, on the other hand, is quite possibly the most boring protagonist in an action movie.  He's so overpowered that he doesn't have to use a single shred of creativity or effort to defeat his foes.<br /><br />Now this is where the action scenes come in.  Simply put, they're some of the most boring you'll ever see.  This is so because aside from Preston being too powerful to pique any interest from the viewer, so many of the enemies he fights don't put fourth a shred of effort in their attempts to take down Preston.  It's like they're lining up to get killed by this guy, and this makes for extremely boring action.  Some may say that the action scenes look amazing because of how well-staged they are, but this is one of their biggest faults because even in the context of a dystopian sci-fi flick, they look too absurd since the enemies are practically letting Preston kill all of them (other than the obligatory \\"boss battles\\" near the end).<br /><br />Among the worst examples of the plentifully bland action scenes has to be near the end.  Preston confronts the group of government troops guarding DuPont's office, and in the midst of him annihilating them, there's this really goofy move Preston does where he throws two gun magazines with balancers on them across the room and when his guns run out of ammo, he sticks his guns on the balanced magazines on the floor and continues fighting.<br /><br />Perhaps if Equilibrium were an over-the-top action movie not meant to be taken seriously like Commando, then seeing an overpowered hero blast away the opposition without effort could have been mindless fun, but Equilibrium takes itself way, way too seriously.<br /><br />TRYING WAY TOO HARD TO BE \\"DEEP\\"<br /><br />Oh boy, this movie tries way, way too hard to be emotional, deep, and symbolic, and I rolled my eyes throughout these scenes.  I was angrily groaning in the scene were Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson) was interrogated by Preston, and she was going on about how \\"life without feeling is like a clock ticking.\\" I wrote better dialogue when I was in the ninth grade, and it didn't help that Watson's acting was a total bore.  Eventually, Watson's character gets incinerated because she's a \\"sense offender\\" (the label given to anyone charged with feeling emotions), and there's a scene with Preston crying over it, and I just said \\"Really?\\" Wimmer also resorts to the government killing puppies as cheap means to make the audience hate the bad guys even more.  It's absurd that Wimmer has us see the resistance fighters get gunned down by government troops but not of the puppies.  Scenes like those are more fitting for a Lifetime movie than a serious sci-fi/action film, as they totally reek of the most base attempts at emotional appeal from the audience.<br /><br />Then there's the overuse of symbolism, and they're about as subtle as an Amtrak barreling into a Greyhound bus full of circus clowns at 100 mph.  Between the scenes with Preston tearing off the filter on his window to see the rainbow after a rainstorm and him changing from a black trench-coat to a white one near the end, it's like either Kurt Wimmer doesn't know what the word \\"subtle\\" means or if he assumes the audience is too stupid to notice things unless if they're right in their faces.  The painfully obvious and overdone nature of the symbolism scenes makes this more fitting on the SyFy channel.<br /><br />LACK OF ORIGINALITY<br /><br />Equilibrium is one of the most unoriginal movies I've ever seen.  It's like Kurt Wimmer decided to take ideas and visual styles from The Matrix (which is just a bland mixture of cyberpunk anime and Hong Kong action movies), THX-1138, Fahrenheit 451, and 1984.  You get the premise of emotional suppression from THX-1138, the totalitarian censorship of Fahrenheit 451, the absurd action scenes and guys in trench-coats in The Matrix, and the \\"one world order\\" of 1984.<br /><br />ABSURD PREMISE<br /><br />I have to laugh that according to this movie, the cause of war is human emotion.  Wimmer must have the intelligence and maturity of a sixth grader because any adult will tell you that there's so much more that goes into the causes of war and the \\"evils\\" of the human condition in general than just emotion.  Anyone with enough intelligence will tell you that other things that cause war are clashing religious and political beliefs, natural resources, and money.  The overly childish nature of this premise would be more forgivable if this were a movie geared exclusively for kids, but because this is an R-rated film, this gross oversimplification is like a hammer to the face of anyone with a shred of intelligence.<br /><br />LOGIC VS EMOTION<br /><br />As someone who knows that logical appeal is far more important than emotional appeal in just about anything, I was totally disgusted by the execution of this movie.<br /><br />Equilibrium has plenty of logical flaws, such as the fact that everyone is forced into being emotionless through taking Prozium, yet there's plenty of scenes of government troops and of DuPont showing a lot ofemotion when either enraged or put in a tough spot.  Also, when Preston starts to feel emotion, wouldn't he do things differently than his previous partner (whom he executed for having emotion) did when he started to \\"feel\\" so he wouldn't get caught?<br /><br />Also, with the heavy-handed message about how emotion is so important, it leaves no room for the logical element of human existence playing any importance of society.  Even going along with the premise that emotions cause war (I'm still snickering at how stupid this is), in which the hokey prologue says that mankind couldn't survive another world war, it doesn't bother with the question of the ends justifying the means (which is in this case, keeping everyone doped up on Prozium).  It doesn't let you ponder about that for yourself as you're forced into hating the emotional suppression done by the government.  Also, if people not taking Prozium develops into a problem to where the government needs frequent raids and executions of resistance members, wouldn't the government develop a more efficient way of preventing subversion, such as installing computer chips into people when they're born to make them emotionless?  It's clear that all Wimmer cares about is emotional appeal rather than logical appeal, and people like this are rock-stupid.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />I honestly don't remember anything of this movie's score, so I can't comment much on it.  Though if I totally forgot about it, then it probably wasn't worth remembering.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />Equilibrium tries way too hard to be deep, emotional, and action-packed, and it fails hard on all three categories.<br /><br />Despite the rabid praises Equilibrium is receiving from people around the internet, this movie is a total dearth of cinematic quality in any area.  I'm not joking, Future War, a movie made fun of by Mystery Science Theater 3000, is marginally better than this.  At least that movie had hilarious riffing commentary by the crew aboard the Satellite of Love, whereas no comedic riffing could save Equilibrium.<br /><br />Stick with these movies instead:<br /><br /> Total Recall (1990 version)<br /> Robocop<br /> Aliens<br /> THX-1138<br /> The Terminator (1 and 2)<br /> Blade Runner<br /> Ghost in the Shell<br />District 9<br /><br />Avoid Equilibrium at all costs.e one near the end, it's like either Kurt Wimmer doesn't know what the word \\"subtle\\" means or if he assumes the audience is too stupid to notice things unless if they're right in their faces.

B0036EH3XE|1.0|I've been a huge fan of Lost since Season 1.  I bought all of the seasons on DVD.  I convinced my friends to give this series a chance, loaned them my DVDs to watch so they could catch up and get hooked when the latest episode aired.<br /><br />However, I was very disappointed with Season 6.<br /><br />Spoilers begin here, so stop reading if you really want to find out for yourself.<br /><br />Many other Amazon reviewers have already pointed out the big mysteries never revealed, and I agree with nearly all of them.  However, if there is one glaring example of how the writers failed this season, it's in the season opener.<br /><br />In every first episode of each of the six seasons, the first episode featured a grand, iconic image which foretold what was to come, and teased the importance of the series.  In Season 6, we're treated to a view on board on airplane which apparently is in 2004.  It is the the flight that does NOT crash on the island.  Curious things are different on this flight, but at the end of the season opener, there is this fantastic shot:<br /><br />The camera pans out through the window, down into the ocean below, and shows a grand sweeping view of the island completely underwater.  It's submerged, with all of the details that indicate that SOMETHING HAPPENED to sink this island!  OK, we're all excited now!  This season is going to show us WHAT HAPPENED TO SINK THE ISLAND!<br /><br />And that answer never comes!  It turns out this entire \\"flash-sideways\\" alternate reality is not real at all, but a sort of purgatory that never really existed.  It's just a place where the island survivors can find each other before they move onto heaven.  Or whatever.  So if that's the \\"beautiful conclusion\\", WHY SHOW US THE SUNKEN ISLAND?!<br /><br />Sadly, the sunken island is another one of those items which is hyped up clearly to appear to be incredibly important, but then dismissed later as totally unimportant.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />In Season 1, Claire is told repeatedly, by many people who seem to know something (how else could they be giving her the same advice?) that her baby Aaron, should NOT BE RAISED BY ANOTHER.  Very important, this fact.  Why?  And why would all these people know this?  (Again, another silently discarded mystery.)<br /><br />In Season 1, Walt is clearly magical.  Heck, birds lose their ability to navigate and fly into windows when he's around.  The Others know this, kidnap him and subject him to many tests.  Huge amount of time spent trying to track him down and figure out how to get him back.  Why is he so important?  Why does he appear to John Locke magically like he's a ghost on the island?<br /><br />Hugo's main squeeze, Libby, is shown as being stuck in a mental institution.  Why is this important?<br /><br />Eloise Hawking is able to talk to our main man Desmond, and tell him all about time travel, and how you can't change the past, it course-corrects.  She's almost like a God in Season 3, all knowing and calm.  Kind of like the Oracle in the Matrix movies.  She even seems to have lived this life many times in the past, as she says in later seasons to Charles Widmore, \\"for the first time, I don't know what's going to happen.\\"  So what happened with her?<br /><br />The biggest insult of all is that dedicated fans subscribed to the Official Lost Podcast on ABC's website and through iTunes.  Every week the podcast was put on by the two executive producers and head writes, Damon Lindelef and Carlton Cuse, who insisted they had a plan.  Go back and watch the Season 1 DVD extra features where another writer will be shown insisting that all this chaos does have a plan.  Stick with us, they promise, it's all going to work out in the end.  They convinced me that they knew all about bad story telling - they hated Star Wars prequels \\"explanation\\" of the force.  Right there with you guys.  They also really didn't like endings where \\"it was all a dream\\".  That's a relief.  And they promised, noending like the Sopranos.<br /><br />By the end of the Season 6 podcasts though, I started to get a real pit in my stomach, and really worried.  They talked about how much the *like* the Sopranos ending.  Wha-what?!  And they talked about how much they hated the Matrix sequels, saying that over-explaining was worse than leaving things a mystery.  Uh, okay, I understand, but you're starting to make me worry that maybe you're just going leave stuff behind.  Viewers would ask questions about what happened with Walt and Claire, and they would make silly jokes.  And then they decided maybe they should end the podcast before the finale, because they wanted the show to \\"speak for itself\\".  No appearances on on TV shows after the finale either.  Hmm, sounds like these guys are running away from something.<br /><br />Then the finale happened.  And the backlash began.  I feel for these guys, in some ways.  They built a huge mystery for 3 seasons before they knew how long the show was going to run.  So in many ways, they dug a big hole without knowing how large they needed to make it.  But then they announced triumphantly after Season 3 they secured an end date with ABC for 6 seasons.  Fantastic!  They were proud of how this is a rare occurence; a chance to end the show ON THEIR OWN TERMS.  They had 3 years of shows ahead of them, a chance to map the endign the way they wanted - stick with them, it's going to be great ride.<br /><br />We stuck with you guys.

B002ZG98VO|5.0|I loved everything about this film from the fabulous score to the storyline. However I can't help notice to many continuity errors from where they have been forecd to chop back the films time. There is lots of sub plots not included or explained in the film at dozens of points. It stands out quite a bit e.g. when robin quickly says 'we have two days', err howd he know that. The film has evidently been butchered to please the 'time' gang. RIDLEY please give us a full 3hr+? version of the film as it is ment to be seen. I don't want to wait for the 10th anniversary for an extended version where he says in commentary the cinema version was his definative version (thats bull by the way, its evident he hates the movie studios for limiting masterpieces like gladiator, the extended versions were much better.)    This film needs a sequel to knock prince of theives from memory... the ensamble cast have a great energy together and it would be fab to see the adventure continue, this film is screaming out for a sequel.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|If you like Jack Johnson's music, I recommend that you buy To the Sea.    Sure, it's a little different in style and instrumentation but like all his stuff, it grows on you quickly and exponentially.     I bought the CD at the store yesterday, and I've only been listening to the CD for a day, so I can't pass good judgment yet on how well the tracks or overall album compares to his previous works. Nonetheless, coming from someone who rarely purchases CD's, this purchase is well worth the money. Plus, some of the proceeds are donated!     Good music. You don't want to miss out!
B000002IZ4|4.0|stone temple pilots released this great cd in 1994.purple was s.t.p,s second album.after the powerful and amazing debut album 'core' s.t.p. was going strong.i,ve recently been rediscovering my 90,s music collection,in my opinon the first three stone temple pilots albums were the best albums they did.it seems around the third album 'tiny music'scott wieland started to have some troubles with the law and s.t.p. was kind of in limbo for a while.i have been a fan of stone temple pilots since core in 1992.to my ears s.t.p. sounds a little like alice in chains although s.t.p. definately had their own trade mark sound.on this album they had a good collection of songs and they performed them well here. there is more to this diverse album than just the radio hits;vasoline,big empty and interstate lovesong both of which showed this band was expanding it,s sound horizons from overt heaviness of most of the debut album core.s.t.p proved they could write good acoustic songs as well as great rockers.for me the great ones on this cd are;lounge fly,still remains,pretty penny,unglued,silvergun superman and kitchenware,candy bars.if you are a stone temple pilots fan you already know this album,core and tiny music are classics!!if you are new to s.t.p. this album or core would be good for starters!!this album should be played loud and enjoyed greatly if you want great 90,s alternative rock!!!
B000008GVG|5.0|In 1980, Iron Miaden released their first full-length , self-titled name, with excellent musicians. It's a great start for this music legend<br />The sound  is not polished. It’s an album with a dirty / RAW sound,  the production is not bad at all, but it can be much better.<br />Steve Harris, with his legendary BASS and the feeling that he gives, so characteristic  and distinctive sound,<br />Clive Burr is a machine at the drums  especially in songs like &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; where it looks incredibly good or the catchy &quot;Running Free&quot;, he's just an excellent drummer<br /> I also highlight the voice of Paul Di'Anno, a singer with a big charisma and a perfect voice for the first Iron Maiden phase, with that raspy voice on songs like &quot;Prowler&quot; or &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; and the beautiful and clean vocal lines in &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Strange World&quot;.<br />Dave Murray (loyal to the band since the beginning) and Dennis Stratton do an impeccable job creating and executing excellent riffs, as the beginning of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and all the incredible solos it has; or the catchy riff from &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;,<br /><br />OVERALL: Iron  Maiden&quot; is a highly recommendable album, here begins the legend and the best was yet to come. Great songs, very worked, memorable and catchy.  Nice booklet whit pictures,notes, lyrics  and those things we enjoy
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|I agree with those reviewers who stated that this movie was not as good as the first movie; I also agree with those who believe that neither movie comes close to the greatness of the series.  It would be impossible, however, for any movie to transcend the perfection of the two-part series finale.  Having said all of that, I loved the first movie, and I love this one because I am an ardent fan of Sex in the City.      Even though both movies were quite lengthy, they weren't lengthy enough for me.  While watching Sex and the City 2, I kept wanting more than a mere few seconds of how the ladies met, more of Smith, more of Steve, and more of the Steve/Miranda relationship (which I felt was one of the strengths of the first movie).  I do not need more of the Charlotte/Harry relationship unless they actually encounter a serious issue within their wedded bliss.    I do think, however, that this movie was funnier than the first movie.  My fellow moviegoers and I laughed out loud at many lines.  Oddly enough, my favorite scene was probably the one between Miranda and Charlotte (whom I usually find very unfunny).  The line that evoked the most laughter from anyone in the audience, including me, was Charlotte's line about not wanting to lose the nanny.  I also thought Samantha's behavior when the angry male crowd began forming around her was hilarious.  Of course,the phrase, \\"Bite me,\\" accompanied by a hand gesture, has always provoked laughter from me.    Bottom line, if you are the fan that I am, you will love this movie, but you will still want more.  I want a Sex and the City movie every two years because letting go of these characters is very difficult, if not impossible.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|Don't like any of the Hanna Montana songs or her early career. So went to this film expecting the worst. the film actually turned out well. Not a chick flick but more of a drama. Miley Cyrus did a pretty good job considering her goofy early dramatic and music work designed for popular appeal to certain kids. This film is actually interesting with good acting by the brother, father and the rest of the cast.    This film had an interesting story and is the kind of film I would not have even gone to had there been anything in the theater I had not already seen. it actually could be liked by any age. I, personally, think that Miley Cyrus may change direction in her career. She recently took her real fathers name in an official name change. I expect that Miley will not follow in the footsteps of other Disney losers like Britney Speers and Lindsay Lohan. This film is a step in the right direction but her recent American Idol appearance was pretty bad. The film is worth seeing.     Was the above review useful to you?
B000SGGUWS|5.0|this is one of the best, most addicting books and series i have ever read even as a huge reader. i read this in 2 nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. i have never read such a relatable and unapologetic series in my life, and that ferocity and fearlessness is absolutely amazing. it is addictng and it has been less than a week and i am on the 4th one. whether you are a teenaged boy like me or a girl like my girlfriend who is also obsessed, you have to give this modern teen classic a shot.
006145205X|4.0|I've read all of Ridley's books and have recently read my favorite, \\"The Red Queen-Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature\\" for the second time. Toward the end of the Red Queen, Ridley openly admitted that half of the hypothesis presented are probably wrong. That is not only true, but refreshingly honest, and is probably also true for many other books of this type, including this one I'm reviewing. I have also written a much more detailed review of this book at the Biodiversivist Blog. Google the term \\"Biodiversivist Rational Optimist.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed (and agree with) many of the ideas presented in this new book and for that reason I would recommend it with the caveat that the reader take with a huge grain of salt its overall premise (as reflected in its title), which is in my opinion, deeply flawed and like the failed Reagan era trickle down philosophy (which gave impetuous to the destruction of the American middle class by facilitating the concentration of more wealth into the hands of the few), may have long-lived negative repercussions.<br /><br />Without government regulations to prevent all wealth from accumulating into the hands of the few as is the natural tendency (wealth begets wealth) human societies will continue to repeat the historical cycle of enslavement and collapse.<br /><br />Ridley would be the first to point out that if optimists always win, natural selection would have made all of us optimists by now. Quite obviously optimists, being the last ones to start running when the lion showed up, have always had a natural check on their populations ; ).<br /><br />One could easily hypothesize that it was excessive optimism that brought about the collapse of Easter Island.<br /><br />It is thanks to the propensity of predictions to nullify themselves by calling attention to a predicted problem that we manage to avoid problems and likewise, this may explain why it's the fate of prophets to be stoned by the ignorant masses.<br /><br />An example would be a newscaster who predicts massive traffic snarls because of road construction. The snarls never materialized because people had been warned by this newscaster. Does this make the newscaster a pessimist, or does this make those who call him one, ah, not the sharpest tacks in the box?<br /><br />The opposite of optimist is pessimist but on your way to pessimist you have to pass the realists. The realists are the ones who keep warning the captain of approaching icebergs, who then takes action to avoid them while the optimists continue to party in the ballroom. They are free-riders--to borrow a term from economics.<br /><br />Ridley's emphasis on optimism in some ways reflects that of the late economist Julian Simon, who was an adviser to Reagan. In a nutshell, Simon believed that because humanity has to-date found solutions to circumvent shortages of resources (plywood is the result of our destruction of 95% of large old-growth trees), we will always do so. Simon believed that the more people there are, the better off the world is. In theory, a population of forty billion is preferable to two billion.<br /><br />The fact that we had skyscrapers, television, antibiotics and airlines when our population was still at two billion strongly suggests to me that  Simon was wrong and that the natural world as well as humanity would be better off today (the number of chronically malnourished recently crossed a billion souls) with a much smaller population, which is water under the bridge at this point thanks in large part to the likes of Julian Simon and Ronald Reagan's infamous  gag rule. I lean toward E.O. Wilson's opinion, that humanity is locked in a race between a growing population and technology capable of abetting the destruction of the biosphere to feed and house that population.<br /><br />The fatal logical flaw in Simon's philosophy (and by proxy, Ridley's), or inversely, the beauty of it if true, is that we could stop all offshore drilling tomorrow, rope off allthat remains of the planet's biodiversity, the entire Congo, the jungles of Malaysia, the Amazon, Cerrado, and many ocean fisheries, in short, we could stop the ongoing extinction event, and humanity would do just fine. We would simply create solutions (like plywood) to the ensuing shortages of natural resources.<br /><br />It seemed to me that Simon's world view reflected that of many religionists, which I thought explained its irrational nature, but Ridley is an admitted atheist with his work being referenced by the likes of Dennett and Dawkins. So much for my \\"irrational religionist\\" hypothesis.<br /><br />For a real world, real time assessment of Mat Ridley's foray into the world of economics read the article titled \\"The Man Who Wants to Northern Rock the Planet\\" by George Monbiot. Economics isn't usually considered a science because it tends to have little predictive capacity.<br /><br />The popularity several years of ago of economist Bjorn Lomborg's book \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" can partially be attributed to Ridley's endorsement on the cover, which got me to read it. I believed at the time that Ridley had made a misstep, tarnishing his own reputation by doing so, but now I can see that Lomborg's book reflects Ridley's ironically, irrationally optimistic (instead of realistic) economic world view.laysia, the Amazon, Cerrado, and many ocean fisheries, in short, we could stop the ongoing extinction event, and humanity would do just fine.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|There are several detailed reviews so I will keep mine short.  I loved their first c/d and and I Love this one.  Their voices, their music!!  All I can say is \\"Fabulous\\".
0316017922|4.0|If you haven't read a Gladwell book before, Outliers is a great place to start.  If you have, and liked what you read before, you'll like this one, too.<br /><br />Gladwell's far-ranging mind, enthusiasm about life in general, and wonderful story-telling abilities are on full display in Outliers.  My wife is a middle-school teacher, and she tells me that to get and keep a student's attention you must have \\"hooks\\": points of interest that grab and hold our notice.  Gladwell has more hooks than Velcro, and as I was tugged along by his thesis that greatness and/or success has nothing to do with the American ideal of \\"the self made man\\", my attention never strayed far before being reeled back in.<br /><br />Gladwell insists that people don't rise to greatness because of innate talent alone, rather they combine sufficient talent with being in the right place at the right time, coming from a culture that encourages hard work, and having doors opened to them by others.<br /><br />Gladwell might affect to portray himself as a neutral observer of human life, but clearly he is not.  In Outliers, he slowly but inexorably builds a case that in science (Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project), music (the Beatles), technology (Bill Gates, Stephen Jobs), and in many other fields, it is hard work PLUS a door being opened at an opportune moment that leads to success that is more than two standard deviations beyond the norm.  And is in discussing those doors that open that Gladwell becomes passionate.  Regardless of the field of endeavor, humans thrive in systems (systems as small as a family, or as big as a nation) that provide opportunity to excel.  Gladwell lauds the rare educational systems that focus fiercely on providing opportunity for every student, and rails at systems that do not.  I found his call to open windows and doors of opportunity to people compellingly personal, and as a business man/citizen/parent, unforgettable.<br /><br />Entertaining, intriguing, and challenging, Gladwell has written yet another book that will make the reader cast their eyes on familiar landscape only to find that they see the world around them in an entirely different way.et another book that will make the reader cast their eyes on familiar landscape only to find that they see the world around them in an entirely different way.
0679805273|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite books written by Dr. Seuss and one that I read to my daughter when she started school last year.<br /><br />It is really an inspiring book about change and what to look forward to, without the somewhat serious or darker moments in other books, such as in Horton where the Whos are in danger.<br /><br />The book is also perfect for anyone about to have a big change - changing jobs, moving, graduating.  The chances are many people have read this at one point or another, but may not have a copy anymore.  It usually brings a smile during times of transition and shows that in some respect we never really grow up completly.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|this book is alot like the percy jackson and the olympians series. one of the things it has in common is that the both are one of the best books have ever read! i am looking for more books by him
0061537969|5.0|T Art of Racing in The Rain is a wonderful read!    I enjoyed it very much!  It gave me new insite into my 4 dogs.    Thank you for offering the book!
030726999X|3.0|\\"Hornest Nest\\" is by far the weakest of the Millenium Trilogy.  At times it is just a diatribe voicing all of Larsson's grudges against society.  The book is too long -- padded -- and could have been much better with some judicious editing.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|Like everyone who saw \\"Once\\", I fell in love with these two's music instantly. A great \\"sequel\\" to the soundtrack. Might be a bit mellower but the song writing and vocals are very moving. I've listened to some of The Frames as well and I think this is some of Glen's most powerful work. Highly recommended.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|This is good new music from Jack Johnson. \\"Pictures of People Taking Pictures\\" is my favorite track. This is a fun song that makes me happy. Jack's music always puts me in a good mood.  \\"You and Your Heart\\" is a song that does just that. I love the harmonica playing on the song \\"Red Wine and Mythology\\" Zach Gill plays the keyboard with Jack.  He compliments Jack's vocals well on this song. \\"Anything But The Truth\\" is a very soothing song that puts my mind at ease. Jack's guitar playing is beautiful on this song.  Adam Topol is such a talented drummer. He shines on the song \\"From The Clouds\\". This song is a three minute party. \\"Only The Ocean\\" is a such a peaceful song. \\"The Upsetter\\" is a song about trying to achieve inner peace. It has a funky sound to it. \\"Turn Your Love\\" is such a pretty song. This song is very relaxing. \\"No Good With Faces\\" is another song with the harmonica playing.  This song is about trying to find direction in life.  I can relate to the lyrics of this song being bad remembering faces and names myself.  The title track is a song about how the sea can be a source of serenity.  Jack rocks on the guitar on this tune.  Every track on this disc sounds unique.  I love this CD.
B002ZG997C|5.0|By now you've seen what the movie is essentially about--post apocalyptic journey to get the Bible to safety. I think if you go into this movie with certain expectations, you might be disappointed. Thankfully, I knew nothing about it before I saw it! Some people have pointed out that there is some heavy-handed religious grandstanding going on in this movie. I won't deny that there is definitely a religious undertone, but it's actually not an overt 'religion is great' message. Eli starts out on the road intent on his path. He's on a mission, he's got a message, he's going to get to his goal, and to hell with who he cuts down or stomps on to do so. Considering he's carrying the Bible, there are pretty obvious real life parallels. Look at today's right wing Christians (note, not all are right wing!) in their fight against homosexuality or abortion. They are right and moral and have a message, dammit! Who cares what PEOPLE are crushed in the process, right? But through the course of the movie, Eli starts to understand that getting to the goal isn't the test, it's how he does it. This is the story of a man who travels from fundamentalism to true faith, not just words but action. No matter what your religious (or non-religious) background, I think something can be gained from the message of this movie.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Great trilogy; I never get tired of watching them over & over. Great cast, superb acting to great contiguous story line. Fight choreography probably the best in modern movie history; well-done special effects. This crew rivals any so-called super hero. Neither Superman nor Batman have anything on NEO. I recommend this Trilogy for all the awards. Even more spectacular in Blu-Ray .
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Can't say enough about this adaptation of McCullogh's book. Sure, they had to leave tons of stuff out but that's only because the book is sooo long (even though I absolutely love it). Giamati is great as always and so is Linney; not to mention all the actors, particularly the Washington and Jefferson performances. I've read a ton of Revolutionary War history and this series really captures the feel of those times so powerfully. Highly recommended.
0393072231|5.0|I won't go into too much detail (it's been covered in the other reviews), but I'd like to point out, first of all, that Lewis' fabulous writing really makes a difficult subject easy to swallow. He's no Shakespeare, but he writes very cleanly, and plainly. In a good way, like someone sitting you down and simply telling you a story. In this case, a very SCARY story.    Everyone should read this book. Everyone. Because the economy affects everyone, and the damage these morons caused will continue to haunt our Country, and probably the World, for decades. It's a clear, well-researched account of what happened, why it happened, and who caused it.    Morons include: The Investment Banks, The Hedge Funds, The Ratings Agencies, The Insurers, The Fed, Congress, the SEC, and, yes, even the ordinary Americans who took out those stupid mortgages in the first place.    In a nutshell, it turns out we didn't learn anything from the DotCom Bubble; even though it only happened a few years ago and was a \\"big deal\\", on every channel, 24/7. But once again, we have to learn, painfully, that Basic Economic theory always applies. ALWAYS. No matter how \\"exotic\\" the investment vehicle. The risk has to go SOMEWHERE. Someone ultimately HAS to have the other side of every \\"bet\\". Period. And these were a bunch of people who sincerely thought the rules had changed.    If the first 250 pages don't get you, the last 20 pages will infuriate anyone: where Lewis provides an exhaustive listing of the Bailouts, and who got what.    Ultimately the biggest rule that was broken in all of this, is the rule of failure. The way The World works is if you do something stupid, you get burned. Only these morons didn't get burned. They got rich. Really, really rich. Even millions of adventurous homebuyers are getting reduced mortgages out of this. The Biggest Losers are Banks, Businesses and ordinary Americans who followed the rules. The Big Short reads like a Crime Thriller, but is really an Outright Tragedy.
0375423877|2.0|With all the hype surrounding this book, I expected to love it. I didn't. The story begins with a slow narrative about Africa, which is where Mma Ramotswa, the main character lives. We then get a very short anecdote about a case Ramotsaw handles through her detective agency. From there, we get many pages of background information from her father's life, in her father's voice - and her father is already dead. By the time the story got back around to the detective agency, I had forgotten the book was supposed to be about a a female detective. I found the book slow and lacking in focus. Honestly, 2 stars is being generous for me.
030726999X|5.0|For the moment, THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST is the final volume in what has become known as The Millennium Trilogy. Originally intended as the third of at least a 10-volume series, this is the late Stieg Larsson's final complete work. Clocking in at 576 pages, the book is dense, convoluted, complicated, and yes, wonderful in every conceivable way. Wrapping up virtually every dangling plotline from the previous two installments, it provides a definite and definitive ending to a series for which its author and the story behind him have become almost as popular and controversial as the novels themselves.<br /><br />A warning here: if you have not read THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO and THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, you are going to be extremely confused by the first 100 pages or so of THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST. Larsson doles out his recaps in a piecemeal fashion, going full bore into what is happening in the story's present while at the same time introducing new characters and providing new historical revelations as to why people are behaving as they are. Then there are those Swedish names. If you wonder why the alphabet has 26 letters, it is so there will be enough of them to spell Swedish names. Truly.<br /><br />Although the beginning is slow, it is worth every minute it takes to read every sentence because the remainder of the novel easily can be completed in one sitting. Complicated as it is, the plot can be summed up in one hyphenated word: cover-up. The book begins with Lisbeth Salander (The Girl) hospitalized with a bullet in her head following the conclusion of THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE. Zalachenko, Salander's father and the man who she hates more than anyone in the world, is in a hospital bed a few short steps from her, grievously wounded from Salander's previous attack. Niedermann, Salander's brother, is on a murderous rampage through the Swedish countryside. And Mikael Blomkvist, chief investigative reporter for Millennium magazine and Salander's protector in spite of herself, is under arrest. Even as Salander's life hangs in the balance, a mysterious, closely held, quasi-official agency known to very few as The Section plots to ensure that, if Salander recovers from her grievous injuries, she will never see the outside of an institution again.<br /><br />A great deal of HORNET'S NEST concerns the how and, perhaps as importantly, the why of what was done to Salander in her childhood. The majority of the work, however, focuses on Blomkvist's dogged investigation into Salander's persecution, which in turn leads to Blomkvist's gradual discovery and uncovering of The Section. His efforts do not go unnoticed by The Section, and what follows is as complex, fascinating and dangerous a game of cat-and-mouse as you are likely to encounter in contemporary genre fiction. Blomkvist is a brilliant and dangerous adversary, but The Section is willing to stop at nothing to prevent him from revealing what he knows through Millennium, or to keep Salander --- should she survive --- under wraps. And, lest we forget, Niedermann, the personification of every nightmarish Scandinavian fairy tale, is on the loose as well.<br /><br />Before he died, Larsson reportedly had started a fourth volume and outlined an additional six books. It is doubtful that any of those will see the light of day in any form. What we have from him now, in any event, is a stunning, multi-leveled work, full of complex plots and unforgettable characters, both of which will stay with you long after you read the final words of THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST.

B0038QGXHW|5.0|With JASMINE (ECM Records, May 2010 release), Keith Jarrett (piano) and Charlie Haden (double bass), have achieved precisely what they were hoping to with this album of ballads from The Great American Songbook - created an album of absolute, exquisite BEAUTY. A work containing restraint, space, intimacy, and a sublime reverence for the gorgeous melodies that are stated and explored on each of the tunes on this c.d., distilling the essence of each with a tastefulness and an economy that could only come from two artists who are at this moment of their musical journeys, at the very top of their game, musically, personally, spiritually. Another reviewer calls this album \\"an instant classic.\\" It is. The following is from the liner notes of the album: \\"Art is dying in this world, and so is listening, as the world becomes more full of toys and special effects.\\" How true that appears to be. But then perhaps its for moments like this that certain individuals are called to a lifetime in music, who happen to be \\"obsessed with beauty,\\" and choose to follow that call into the creation of an album precisely like JASMINE? I can't imagine anyone who has the good fortune to listen to the music on this c.d., not being immediately put back in touch with what matters most in this world. The tunes are: FOR ALL WE KNOW / WHERE CAN I GO WITHOUT YOU / NO MOON AT ALL / ONE DAY i'LL FLY AWAY / I'M GONNA LAUGH YOU RIGHT OUT OF MY LIFE / BODY AND SOUL / GOODBYE / DON'T EVER LEAVE ME. The only criticism I have of this album is Mr. Jarrett's habit of using his voice while he plays. I suspect he's been doing this for so long he can't help himself. At times, these sounds he makes distract from the music and I'm reminded I'm still here in the world, not in Heaven. This, also from the liner notes: \\"Here is some music for you. Take it and its yours.\\" You bet. And with all kinds of gratitude.  Most highly recommended.
0385523386|2.0|It's very hard to feel any sympathy whatsoever for this author's so-called \\"predicament\\".......she's NOT the victim she portrays herself to be.<br />I really wanted to love this book because the idea/subject is so interesting and intriguing, especially in light of Martha Stewart's shocking stint in Camp Fed.<br />But I was very disappointed and came away with the feeling that the author was smug about her backround and upbringing. Enough already with the constant reminders that you graduated from Smith! Wake up! You did time in prison, get over yourself, get humble! When Piper is in Dorm B aka \\"the Ghetto\\" she refers to being concerned that other prisoners are jealous that she's \\"got it like that\\" because so many friends and family members are sending her books to read. How fortunate for her. She should be grateful to others...this does not represent any accomplishment on her part. Also, the author seems to indicate that since her drug trafficking/money laundering crime happened years ago that it \\"did not really count\\" compared to the other inmates' (some of them seemed more hardened criminals) offenses.<br />There IS some altruism on the author's part, and also some genuine kindness and insight but overall the author's attitude regarding social classes vs. her own social standing is a big turn off.<br />Even her jacket photo looks rather smug.<br />Bottom line: If one commits (or is even an accessory to)a crime, and they get caught, they should accept responsibility for their actions (rather than blaming others ie: Nora)and also let humility be one of the lessons learned from the experience.

I was just about to buy (May 2010) a foreign bond mutual fund and they scared the be'jesus out of me.  Are we really in the Second Great Contraction?  Are we repeating third world defaults and deserving of the neo-liberal World Bank cures which rob the poor and open the way for more rampant capitalism.  Certainly we are not taking our own medicine but seem to be continuing the disenfranchisement of the bottom half.  So what are the factors involved in this contraction: a flood of cheap exogenous capital, economic liberalization, increasingly lax regulatory oversight, real-estate and maybe stock excesses, increasing public indebtedness, short-term borrowing for long term illiquid investment.  Anything else: how about corruption (even legal like derviatives), increasing economic stratification, private splendor and public squalor?  Some Hobson or other in the 1920s characterized capitalist busts as the result of too much production chasing too little purchasing power as the distribution of income disproportionately rewards the rich.<br /><br />I found the authors' arguments pretty convincing although I wasn't always able to follow their line of reasoning or see what they saw in the charts they used.  They seem to claim that governments rarely grow their way out of default.  Mostly they devalue, inflate or otherwise steal the money from their citizens as with savings bonds or Soviet bank interest.  And most important, serious defaults take much much longer than usually assumed and inflation almost always occurs.  Right now we seem to have a worldwide meltdown.  And what are we doing about it: keeping interest rates too low, not really reregulating, trying to save real-estate which was insanely inflated,  trying to create demand while fighting two wars,  intent on keeping finance doublethe size in GDP than it was before the run up, barely addressing the maldistribution of income, and not taking on the inadequacies of education, health and other infrastructure.  Oh well.  Capitalism. Don't rock the boat too much.  And they say the economic tigers of Asia won't save us.  But I didn't get their reasoning about their role in the current crisis.  Yes, they have also experienced the default and contraction themselves in the not too distant past.  But now they seem to be doing OK, even Japan for all its inability to heal its past contraction.  Its savings rate saved it despite the fact that it aging population will eventually do it in.<br /><br />I am rambling.  Read this book.  But it is not very readable.  I am glad I did.  Now I have no idea what to do with my potential investment.  A one per cent CD?  How not different is it this time?

044024367X|4.0|Drifter Jack Reacher travels the country with the clothes on his back and a fold-up toothbrush and ATM card in his pocket. Reacher's goal is to cross America diagonally, beginning in Calais, Maine and ending in San Diego, California. Taking buses and hitching when he has to, the trip proves uneventful until he leaves the small town of Hope, Colorado and walks to Despair, the next town over. Stopping in a diner for a cup of coffee, Reacher is refused service and ordered out of town by the cops. This gets Reacher's back up and when he refuses to leave, he's arrested as a vagrant, escorted out of town and told never to come back. On the way back to Hope, he stumbles over the body of a dead man and the ex military cop in Reacher suspects the man's death has something to do with Despair. So, over the next few days, Reacher, with the aid of a female cop in Hope, investigates why Despair has a no-visitors policy, what's going on with the town's metal recycling plant with an impregnable fence, and why young men are disappearing.<br /><br />In this 12th installment of the Jack Reacher series, there's plenty of action as Reacher kicks butt in Despair, diligently and persistently trying to find out what the metal recycling plant is actually doing inside its secret compound and why a military base is guarding it. Reacher is absolutely one of the coolest characters written. He's tough mentally and physically, a vigilante seeking justice for those who deserve it while doling out his own kind of two-fisted justice for those who need it.
0525423842|2.0|I usually enjoy reading a John Grisham novel and thought it was great he was branching out to the younger readers, especially with a boy as the main character. James Patterson is able to carry his intriguing writing style over to YA with Maximum Ride and I was hoping Grisham would be able to do the same. He certainly fell flat. There is nothing to grab you for the first 100 pages or so, I actually fell asleep 2 nights trying to read this book. Then,when the suspense is starting up it just doesn't go anywhere. I think there was a great plot that Grisham played safe with in writing for this age. Also, too wordy in places in trying to explain law and court terms that wasn't needed, which is what made the beginning drag. Next time, he needs to co-write with an experienced YA writer and I'm sure that would make an excellent book.
030726999X|5.0|I read the first book in two days, the second in one day and it took me just a little over a day to read this one.<br /><br />The book ties the multiple story lines beautifully and Larsson managed to carry the thrill of the subplots to the end without sacrificing a satisfying ending.<br /><br />What I loved most about these books was Larsson's ability to take a larger plot and install within it subplots while still being able to wrap things up by the end. It takes a level of creativity to wind so many ideas together that most authors simply don't have.<br /><br />I will warn you: my five-star rating is biased. I love this trilogy so much and the character of Lisbeth Salander so much that I couldn't imagine giving it less than five stars. If I removed those aspects from my consideration it probably would've been a four-star book for reasons described below.<br /><br />The tragedy of the series (and this book particularly) is that Larsson died so soon after he submitted them. There are certainly a couple of questions left open that would've made great source material for future books (alas!).<br /><br />I would advise future readers of the following: try to consider that as far as the actual language of some of this book goes Larsson did not have the benefit of being able to edit his work (at least not the multiple times many authors do) prior to his death. Additionally, as with the other books some of the translation is stilted and awkward. Considering both, there were a couple of peculiar scenes in the book that probably could've been disposed of all together and certainly some exposition that needed the same.<br /><br />Still, if you liked the first two you will like this.<br /><br />All I have to say is THANK HEAVENS he submitted all three before his death.

0143116177|5.0|I have just finished reading the best financial book ever, and I have read most of them. It is The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World by Harvard professor Niall Ferguson. It gives you a great explanation of how the broad sweep of history delivered us to the doorstep of today's crisis. Ferguson starts with an ancient accounting system written on clay tablets in Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago, and then takes us through the economic dominance of Greece and Rome. We learn about a medieval Italian diplomat named Fibonacci, who imported advanced mathematical concepts from the Middle East, which we still trade around today. He plots the rice of the great banking dynasties, such as the Medicis and the Rothschilds (Jacob was my neighbor in London). It is also a pot boiling narrative of the great financial scandals, starting with the Mississippi bubble which wrecked France, the South Sea bubble where Sir Isaac Newton lost his shirt, to the Ponzi schemes of the 20th century. The story tells us how the financial center of the world has migrated from Babylon to Cairo, Rome, Venice, Amsterdam, London, and eventually ending up in a hedge fund dominated New York. Ferguson is particularly astute in explaining in layman's terms the borrowing binge and the exotic, super leveraged instruments the lead to the current crash. The author finishes with an explanation of how American overconsumption is financed by Chinese saving, and why this can't last. If you are looking for a single tome which ties it all together, this is it.[...]<br /><br />-The Mad Hedge Fund Trader

B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I want more of these characters!! I keep re-reading this book and really like how \\"real\\" both these characters are and how despite their obvious differences they fit well together.

It made it all the more interesting to read. GREAT BOOK!
B00275EHIM|3.0|The sight of Jake Gyllenhaal in a defiantly heroic pose with his imposing dagger on the poster of this 2010 fantasy adventure would seem to portend a film filled with self-parody, but alas, the actor takes the Aladdin-like title role semi-seriously. He's actually better than expected in the over-the-top derring-do role, but the movie itself is absurdly convoluted and overly ridiculous, even by the standards of the 2003 video game which inspired this CGI-saturated production. It should come as no surprise that the executive producer is action-schlock master Jerry Bruckheimer, whose commercial track record extends from [[ASIN:B00005JKCB Beverly Hills Cop]] to the [[ASIN:B00005JN5E National Treasure]] franchise. What did surprise me is that the director is Mike Newell, better known for soft, female-oriented fare such as [[ASIN:B00005JL1R Enchanted April]] and [[ASIN:B00000JRTX Four Weddings and a Funeral]]. However, both he and Gyllenhaal give themselves almost entirely to Bruckheimer's more commercial, comic-book sensibilities.<br /><br />The fanciful plot takes place in the sixth century B.C. where we find a Persian street urchin named Dastan being adopted by King Sharaman for his courageous acrobatics in a crowded marketplace. He grows up with his loyal foster brothers Garsiv and Tus, the rightful heirs to the throne who lead the Persian army in an attack on the sacred city of Alamut. In a none-too-subtle allusion to current-day Iraq, the siege on Alamut comes from a wrongful assumption that the city's people are selling weapons to their enemies. Behind the assault is the King's brother and trusted advisor, the Dick Cheney-like Nizam. Elsewhere in the city, Dashan leads a swashbuckling rogue effort that leads him to the comely Princess Tamina who holds the secret behind the mythical Dagger of Time. The dagger has time-bending powers that allow the user to undo any mistake and redo any moment. In short order, Dashan gets framed for murder and escapes with Tamina and the dagger.<br /><br />All sorts of contrived shenanigans subsequently follow with the addition of Sheik Amar, an ostrich-racing thief who amusingly hates both taxes and the confining role of government, as the dagger elusively changes hands and a fatalistic sinkhole yields an ending that may remind you of Pam's unexpected discovery of Bobby in the shower on [[ASIN:B000PAAK0A Dallas]]. Aside from Gyllenhaal's muscular performance, Gemma Arterton (a memorable bit as Strawberry Fields in [[ASIN:B001PPLIEG Quantum of Solace]]) makes a fetching princess with plenty of predictable moxy. As Nizam, Ben Kingsley is not nearly as embarrassing here as he was in [[ASIN:B0013J30YU The Love Guru]], but his Oscar will continue collecting dust by itself with his string of disappointing movie choices. The ethnically versatile Alfred Molina steals the film in an act of petty larceny as the comical sheik. With so many special effects coming at the viewer uninterrupted, it was extremely difficult to find a core of humanity in this whole venture. But that's Bruckheimer's objective after all - to overwhelm your senses until you turn into the exact same pulp he chooses to present to all the fanboys and fangirls who will flock to this paper-thin extravaganza.er.

B003C5FMEE|3.0|I listened to the Preview before I bought it and, in the preview, I probably only made it through the first six or seven tracks - it sounded interesting so I bought it. Once you get the album though it's not nearly as tight overall as those first few songs. Fallin' is a great example - it is just a bad R&B song that is a blatant attempt to crossover. There are a few like that - it really undermines the entire album. People who like Fallin' won't like the hard edginess of the next track, The Cure. People who like The Cure will hate Fallin'. I liked neither track but I can appreciate parts of The Cure; Fallin', to me, is just pop candy.

0142000671|3.0|Of Mice and Men is an extremely well written novella about itinerant farmer workers in 1930s California. The piece is tightly crafted with nary a needless word, the dialogue is so vivid that you feel like more like you're eavesdropping on people standing beside you than reading fiction and the story is poignant and controversial: you could have a good debate with someone about the motivations of the characters.    And yet, I have to admit that I admired the novella more than I enjoyed it. It has more foreshadowing than almost anything else I've ever read, enough that I could quickly piece together the scraps I've picked up by accident (as so many people read it, especially in high school). This quickly gave me a pit in my stomach as I was reading. This proved to be a serious distraction. I could recognize the art -- I bought another Steinbeck while I was still reading it -- but it's even heavier than I anticipated. (This is a testament to how the subject matter is handled, but it is just overwhelmingly raw.)    One thing I'm surprised that more of the other reviewers don't mention is how much it reads like a screenplay. The work was quickly turned into a stage play and no wonder: virtually everything takes place through dialogue. Even the backstory, which writers usually describe, is maneuvered into a slightly implausible conversation. (It seems like George is too cautious to tell everything he relays to a farmhand he just met.) And the written descriptions feel like stage directions: \\"On one side of the little room there was a square four-paned window, and on the other, a narrow plank door leading into the barn.\\"
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I loved it. Even though it did seem like Percy Jackson, I still felt like it was something new. I liked how Riordan alternated narrators. It let you see the story from two points. I am obsessed with Percy Jackson, so when I heard Riordan was coming out with another series I decided to try it. AWESOME! Although I still luv Percy Jackson, I've decided to luv the Kane Chronicles just as much. (Well, maybe Percy Jackson is a little bit better.)
B001VNB54A|5.0|The realism in every battles, the brutality and fragile life had been long forgotten..   This miniseries from HBO and the production teams again demonstrated the seriousness of the production.     Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie no doubt were hero. However, many were captured in action such as (Glennie Frazier) and the civilian (Sascha Weinzheimer's Family) were placed in the camp at Philippine, they all demonstrated their heroic sacrifice till the the war ended.        My preference is to watch (The War) from Ken Burns and Lynn Novick first, then watch The Pacific to learn more about the greater generation, who had wrote their histories before us. Unfortunately, many are dying and their stories also buried with them.
0765322889|5.0|I would rate it 4 stars while reading it, it was very confusing at first. Basically, you will understand some things only after reading the whole book or even after going through the next books in the series.  If you can cope with not understanding everything at once, go for it. It's definitely not your average fantasy novel - you have to think a lot while reading.  I love the precision with which Erikson writes and the way he reveals information slowly, so for me, it's 5 stars after getting deeper into the series.

No serious musician listens to Kiss to steal licks or technique.    They do however love to steal the business model that made these guys famous and rich.     Kiss's stab at serious concept music is a bit like Stallone trying to do Shakespeare.    Not a good fit.    Their niche is party music that glorifies sex,drugs and rock n' roll.     It may not play well with their egos ,but it does so with their bank accounts.

Jack Nicholson has done a great job as the Joker(whose real name is not Jack Napier), and Michael Keaton is at his best as The Batman. The music score by Danny Elfman and the songs by Prince were the best components of the movie. The DVD also features a background story of how the film came to be. This will go down as one of the greatest DC Comics movies ever made.
030726999X|5.0|Sadly, first-time Swedish author Larsson did not live to see the worldwide success of his thriller trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire and now The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. Happily for us, he had completed all three books before his untimely death at age 50 and we now discover how Lisbeth Salander (The Girl...) survives the horrific injuries she got at the violent conclusion of Book II.<br /><br />Waking in the hospital she is startled to remember: \\"I was shot in the head. I could stick my finger in the entry wound and touch my brain.\\"<br /><br />Luckily the bullet was a 22 and the surgeon extracts it successfully. We soon discover that brilliant, computer-hacker Salander's dark, ferocious personality has survived intact. \\"She was surprised to be alive. Yet she felt indifferent. If death was the black emptiness from which she had just woken up, then death was nothing to worry about. She would hardly notice the difference. With this esoteric thought she closed her eyes and fell asleep again.\\"<br /><br />Five-foot-nothing, nearly murdered by her sadistic, ex-KGB father, weak as a kitten, but capable of inflicting amazing damage on thugs much bigger, dumber and slower than herself, Salander refuses to cooperate with the police, who are going to charge her with attempted murder for burying an axe in said father's face. Father and daughter are now just doors apart in the hospital, each planning to finish the job on the other.<br /><br />Although Larsson reprises Books I and II sufficiently to refresh the memories of those who have read them, anyone who has not will have difficulty empathizing with the brooding Salander or making sense of the ingenious but convoluted, conspiracy-driven story. If you haven't read Books I and II by all means do. Book III is not the place to start.<br /><br />While Salander lies isolated (no visitors, no computer or phone) in bed, her friend, crackerjack investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, works tirelessly in her defense. Having cleared Salander of the triple-murder charges that dogged her in Book II and having obtained the 1991 security police report detailing the government's efforts to declare Salander insane (after she threw a well-deserved Molotov cocktail at her father) in order to protect her Soviet defector father, Blomkvist runs rings around the secret government agents dogging his steps (and tapping his phone and bugging his apartment) as he prepares to defend Salander in the closed-door trial the government has managed to organize.<br /><br />He's startled however, when people intimately connected with the case begin to die. So is the reader, initially, but we have also been privy to the plotting of the really secret police, the ones even the Prime Minister doesn't know about.<br /><br />Larsson has a lot of threads to weave together here and he takes his time in the beginning, cluing the reader into Swedish government structure, law and ethics, and cold war history. He gathers up loose ends as he goes.<br /><br />The plot accelerates gradually, building to a masterful conclusion. Don't to do anything else while reading the last 200 pages. Not only does Larsson make the pages fly, he also pulls all three books together most satisfactorily.<br /><br />The characters remain wholly absorbing. Salander, of course, is the riveting center. She has proved herself capable of great change while remaining, at bedrock, a grown-up Pippi Longstocking (oh, how she hates that comparison) with Aspergers.<br /><br />Blomqvist, if he weren't up against Salander's outsize personality, could carry the books himself. A dedicated, focused, dogged and brilliant journalist, he remains true to his principles. He's a loyal friend and highly observant, though fairly blind to his own faults. And he's an ingenious plotter.<br /><br />Larsson's fans will be well satisfied except for the deep sadness that there will be no more from this talented writer.cleared Salander of the triple-murder charges that dogged her in Book II and having obtained the 1991 security police report detailing the government's efforts to declare Salander insane (after she threw a well-deserved Molotov cocktail at her father) in order to protect her Soviet defector father, Blomkvist runs rings around the secret government agents dogging his steps (and tapping his phone and bugging his apartment) as he prepares to defend Salander in the closed-door trial the government has managed to organize.

B001ECDVKE|5.0|Mars Attacks! is a hilarious and completely violent comedy about an invasion by Martians and the gory bloodletting that ensues. However, the people of earth retaliates with an unlikely weapon and what came next was pure gross-out material. Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Jim Brown, Michael J. Fox, Pam Grier and Tom Jones are some of the all-star cast in this cult classic directed by Tim Burton and was based on the controversial 1963 Topps bubble gum card series of the same name. Mars Attacks! is sure to delight and repulse any sci-fi movie fan.

B000P0J09W|5.0|This 1985 family adventure classic has a great cult following, and with good reason, this film was the most popular movie of that year. The Goonies is about a group of young friends who is on a search to find a hidden pirate treasure, and trying to outwit a family of career crimnals. The special features includes a video commentary by director Richard Donner and the cast of The Goonies as well as the now-classic 1985 Cyndi Lauper music video. Watching The Goonies has brought back a lot of fun memories for me. the movie is perfect for rainy day weekends or for the kids to watch. :)
1402532903|5.0|There are a lot of reviews for the actual book(Buy it!It's fabulous!) so I'll address this particular disc set.  I really enjoyed listening to the narration by Alyssa Bresnahan. Her clear and articulated reading really made it a joy to listen to, I don't think you could have a better voice read it to you. All the characters had different nuances without it being too theatric or distracting and there's an innocence infused to her voice that made for a very real Susie Salmon.  Thankyou Alyssa, it was so enjoyable.

B00275EHIM|5.0|Prince of Persia video game has been there since forever. I remember playing it on the IBM Dos based system. It was extremely cool. Now we have the chance to enjoy the story in the new movie produced by Disney, Prince of Persia The Sands of Time.     The movie's plot centered around the magical dagger is amazing,  The casting is great.  The direction is spectacular.      Totally enjoyed watching this movie. I highly recommend it.
0385523386|5.0|This book does exactly what it sets out to: tell the author's story of her actions, contact with the criminal justice system, and year in a minimum security federal prison.  Kerman is amazingly brave in writing this memoir- most people could not write two paragraphs about their worst mistake, let alone a whole book. Also to be admired is her stunning honesty. When she confesses to bending or breaking rules or social conventions (taking the good lettuce or bumping another inmate on the running rack) it's not so much evidence of poor (but very human) character but the level of candor with which she is willing to write about her experiences.  This book provides a unique and powerful look into the lives of incarcerated women.    Criticism of Kerman's work on this web site has revolved around two issues - who Kerman is, and what she did, and almost never on the book itself, which is well written and captivating. In short, her story is no less valid because of her race, education, gender or hair color. She reflects on the mistakes she made with brave and insightful comments such as the role of indifference at the heart of most crimes, including hers, and the fact that our prison system fails because it demands that inmates think about themselves and not others.  Anyone reporting that the author shows no remorse has either not read the book, or found the writing too subtle or sophisticated to understand at its most basic level.    The book could be slightly improved with a few small changes.  The book is impossible to put down, but not as easy to pick up in the first place. The title, while meaningful in some respects, does not convey the story well. The picture on the cover is strong, but not strong enough to make up for the title. The publisher should have picked up on those issues. The book could benefit from a brief epilogue about the author's life after prison, but this isn't essential since the book sets out to tell the narrow story of prison life and nothing else.Because the story is narrowly defined some readers seem to have difficulty figuring out Kerman's motive for writing the book, mistakenly thinking it was to make money off her story instead of to describe the life of and initiate discussion about women in the US prison system.  A visit to the author's web page makes her intentions clear; her book could benefit by including the \\"justice reform\\" statement on her web page in her book as well.  A book discussion guide is essential for a book like this (again the publisher should have caught that) and pictures would have been a nice touch. Let's hope the paperback version of the book corrects some of this, but don't let any of this stop you from reading it, it's a story worth investing time and emotion in.    Kerman writes a powerfully engaging story that illuminates and educates, probably reaching an audience that would not ordinarily read about this topic. Her story describes a world many of us prefer not to think about, even though we'll fund it extravagantly and without question. Read this book with your book group, but be sure to invite your local politicians, clergy, nonprofit organizations (and anyone else you can think of) to the discussion in order to help spark the dialogue and change this book is meant to produce.
0802130208|4.0|As Ignatius would say, \\"OH. MY. GOD!\\"  I am so grateful that Ignatius is not my neighbor, employee, acquaintance or family member(although he bares a resemblance to one).  This man is incorrigible.  I am also grateful that I do not have a malfunctioning valve that would dictate my every move.  I'm happy for Mrs. Reilly that Ignatius left, but I want so desperately for Myrna to drop him on the side of the road in Manville.  How is it that a person could be so boorish?  So full of himself?  Such a hypocrite?  It boggles the mind.     Toole was a gifted writer(please say this was not completely autobiographical) with a gift for true to life characters. My favorites were Ms. Trixie and Jones.  I always enjoyed their scenes. WHOA!
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|I was so happy to see a new Keane album out that I bought this without evening listening to the samples. Well, I should've. Where are the energetic vocals? What is with the rapper? What happened to the complex harmonies and well-rounded mix of instruments? All I know is that this album isn't going to get better with subsequent listens, and I wish I hadn't bought it.
0743277708|1.0|I was REALLY looking forward to this one.  When I was a kid a friend of my mom's gave her a copy of this book.  I remember wanting to read it because I respected the friend giving the book.  Then Sawyer was Boone's reading copy on LOST.  That gave it more weight.  \\"Obviously, this is a fantastic piece of literature,\\" I thought.  Sadly, I did not find that to be the case.  There must be something wrong with me for not liking it.  Maybe I expected too much.  I was hoping for something a kin to Animal Farm, which this book is not.  I'm very disappointed.
B001IMFHVG|5.0|Hello,     *Outstanding DVD*     I have grown-up as an amateurish concert-pianist and Rubinstein, among others, has had a profound influence on my \\"career\\" and methodology in approaching the piano (I never had a teacher). I have either played, or I am learning most of the compositions played by The Master in this DVD, and Hats-off to Rubinstein, he pulls this concert off without a hitch. Rubinstein's concentration, mannerism, interpretations, and attention to detail are extraordinary. I absolutely love his upright posture and regal ways; his self-confidence and ability to \\"command his audience\\" elevate his performance and he is quite an inspiration to look-up to...     This is really unfortunate there is so few of these video-recordings around nowadays, because I could watch and listen to Maestro Rubinstein every-single-day 365-days a year, along with his contemporaries... I would love also to have a video-recording of Serge Rachmaninoff himself at the piano, interpreting his own piano-concertos and the Flight of the Bumble Bee, but I doubt the recording equipment of the 1920s were any good, or that such video-records survived throughout the decades...     Cheers,   Charles Henri Darakdjian
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|You've got to give Porcupine Tree a lot of credit.  The band have been slogging it out on the small yet loyal progressive rock underground circuit for almost 20 years now.  Finally with their last two albums they have built up enough momentum to be able to play decent sized venues, sell a decent amount of albums, and even get occasional radio airplay.  For a band right on the cusp of finally hitting the big time, one would think that Porcupine Tree would put out a radio friendly album with an emphasis on commercial potential.  Instead the band took a complete left turn and released a 50 minute plus concept piece called \\"The Incident\\".  This move took a lot of guts for a band trying to make it in today's music climate and I give them props for going this direction.  The real question though, is the album any good?  Personally I think everything Porcupine Tree produces is at the very least good and some of their albums have been absolutely brilliant.  \\"The Incident\\" for me, is not in the brilliant category, but still rises above 90% of the schlock that passes as modern rock n roll these days.  To my ears the band have done better, but this is still a quality release from Mr. Wilson and company.  \\"The Incident\\" itself is, the first disc of a two disc set, broken up into 14 sections.  By far the highlight is the 11 minute plus middle of the work called \\"Time Flies\\".  As others have mentioned this track sounds a lot like \\"Animals\\" era Pink Floyd.  Like \\"Anesthetize\\" on their previous album \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\", \\"Time Flies\\" serves as the central focal point for this disc.  It is truly one of Porcupine Tree's best all time tracks in my opinion.  The beginning and end of \\"The Incident\\" don't quite fare as well.  There are moments of exhilaration, but there are also sections that come close to filler.  Still, overall \\"The Incident\\" is a good solid piece of work if not quite up to some of the band's previous endeavors.  Along with the main disc is a 2nd disc of four additional songs.  These took a while to grow on me, but I have come around to 3 out of the 4 of them.  The final track \\"Remember Me Lover\\" is probably the best with some fine guitar work from Mr. Wilson.  As always with Porcupine Tree, the recording is pristine.  Gavin Harrison continues to prove that he is one of the best drummers on the planet, and Richard Beriberi / Colin Edwin duo on keys and base stay low key, but contribute massively to the overall project.  Although \\"The Incident\\" does not quite live up to the hype surrounding it's initial release this is still a very strong album from one of the top bands on the planet today.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|NO SPOILERS in my review!<br /><br />If you watched Season 6 of Lost on TV, and liked what you saw, then this review is not for you.<br /><br />If for some reason you are contemplating buying this because you've heard all the hype about this show, I'm going to attempt to dissuade you from doing so.<br /><br />This entire series is an expertly written tease with no payoff at the end.<br /><br />But unlike David Lynch movies, this one does not stand up to repeat viewings, because the tease does not get more interesting each time you watch it.  It actually gets more annoying because you know exactly which bits are the red herrings, and which parts actually go somewhere.<br /><br />If you can get past the story, nearly everything else about this TV series is fantastic.  The location is beautiful, the special effects work well for a TV show.  The musical score by Michael Giaciano is haunting and beautiful.  The acting by Terry O'Quinn and Michael Emerson is probably the best I've seen on television.<br /><br />The cast and crew of this show should be extremely proud of the job they have done.  It's by far the most cinematic and epic sweeping show to be on TV these last 6 years and I'm sad to see it go, as I expect after this no network will attempt anything this daring.<br /><br />Such a shame that it was ruined by a horrible 6th season of writing.
B001ASIRZG|1.0|I was really hoping this was just an audio recording of the DVD. They butchered the audio to death.    1. The songs have been shortened with poorly timed, unnatural fades.  2. The songs were rearranged completely out of order from which the were played on the DVD.  3. The recording itself sounds like someone put a cassette recorder in front of their tv while the DVD was playing. I highly doubt this is even a stereo recording.    The DVD is not region 0 as advertised. It does not play on my U. S. DVD player. Someone mentioned in another review it played on their computer - I hope that works. Although I do have the standard region 1 DVD from when it was first released so that's not too important to me. I bought this primarily for the cd. I am disappointed.

6305744793|4.0|Years ago, Fester Adams (Christopher Lloyd) left on a trip to the Bermuda Triangle. Since then the Addams family has not seen him. After many years of holding seance's, Fester finally comes home to his brother's family (Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christina Ricci, and Jimmy Workman), accompanied by a Dr. Greta Pinder-Schloss (Elizabeth Wilson) who supposedly found him washed up in the Bermuda Triangle, but might be looking for more than to reunite a family.    As a general rule, adaptations of old TV shows suck. I'm not trying to be mean, but there are only a few that I actually like, such as: Dukes of Hazzard (guilty pleasure), Get Smart, Starsky and Hutch, and The Addams Family. Of these, The Addams Family is currently my favorite movie based on a TV show, and considering I never really cared for the show (sorry, but The Munsters were more fun to watch as a TV show) and Get Smart is still one of my favorite TV shows of all time, that's saying a lot.    What makes The Addams Family so much fun is the playful nature of the movie mixed with a lot of dark humor. First time director Barry Sonnenfeld (who went on to direct both Men In Black movies and Get Shorty as well as produce the TV show Pushing Daisies) almost makes this feel as though it could be a more comical Tim Burton film, but still remains faithful to the show with throwing fun facts from the show into the mix. The face of the matter is: this movie is just overall fun to watch more than anything else.    The acting also helps in this case. In my opinion, after The Addams Family Values there can be no future Addams Family movies because Raul Julia is dead, and no on will ever play Gomez the way that I think he should be played. Anjelica Huston has never been more beautiful or played a character as sexy as Morticia. In my opinion, though, and this might be because I first noticed her here, Christina Ricci steals the show as young Wednesday Addams.    The one problem that I have with this film is that it definitely drags in the third act. After the party featuring the Mamushka (I think that's how you spell it, but either way it's the best part of the film) we see the Addams's get evicted from their home. Here we see something inspired with something not so inspired. The Addams kids selling acid/poison laced lemonade is inspired, Gomez being depressed and calling the Sally Jesse Raphael show is slightly funny, but overall dated. Overall, the whole third act has a large part of that feeling of being dated and not as funny as the first two acts.    Overall, I would highly recommend this film. I honestly love this film, and can watch it over and over again from beginning to end. Why should you watch? They're creepy, they're spooky, mysterious, and I have to say they're gloriously ooky! Definitely give this a try.    4.5/5
0393072231|5.0|Read this book.    I wept reading the penultimate chapter that related the story of the loneliness (my word, not the author's) of the book's \\"heroes,\\" those who saw what was there to be seen if you looked, with eyes wide open.    I am left with these feelings: that villains got away with murder, that they will remain free and never be charged with wrongdoing, and that the system that allowed these unthinkable things to happen will not be meaningfully changed.  But tomorrow will be business as usual, with the same names in charge.  Next time you hear a politician, even of your own party, call the United States \\"a nation of law,\\" you will know he cannot be trusted.    Ultimately, it is the public that has been so royally screwed; but it knows not where to direct its rage.  Tea Partiers want Obama's head, as though it was in any way his fault.    Wrong as the Tea Partiers may be, the President's reluctance to REALLY take on Wall Street, makes him a co-conspirator against the American people.    This country needs more anger, more angry ACTION, but it needs to be better directed.  I am not clear that Michael Lewis made that job any easier.
B000F8NJK0|3.0|Seeing and hearing Montero perform and improvise live is veeeery impressive, which encouraged me to buy this CD.  Listening to these compositions and improv's individually is fine, but in taking them all together the sound becomes monotonous.  For anyone interested in her improvisations, I suggest getting a CD that has a more varied collection of compositions/songs from which she works.
B001EAWMGA|3.0|This manly medieval sci-fi and swords thriller hits most of the cliches you'd expect but manages still to feel fairly fresh.<br /><br />An alien astronaut - who looks just like James Caviezel - crash lands on a strange planet, that turns out to be medieval Norway, on Earth.  Luckily he has a gadget that can teach him the local Norse dialect in moments (and luckily for us the local dialect sounds just like English).  Unluckily for lots of the locals, he's also unwittingly brought something with him on his ship, a predatory monster who quickly decimates a local village.  As an outlander with strange clothing, the alien guy is immediately suspect in the plunder, and nearby warriors capture and torture him for answers.  Before long, though, you just know he'll be hitting it big with the local beauty, and leading the Vikings on their quest to destroy the beast.<br /><br />It's entertaining enough, though the characters are straight out of nearly every film of this kind you've ever seen.  The wise king, the ambitious warrior who wants to live up to his own dead father's legacy, the warrior princess, lots of grunting fighters, the drunken comic relief, the romance that begins with a slap.  Still, they deliver their lines well, and in spite of lines like \\"may Odin's blessings be upon you,\\" John Hurt plays a convincing king, Caviezel plays a plausible space warrior pilgrim, and Ron Perlman steals every spare moment he's in as a raging rival warlord.  The monster itself is pretty neat, designed to seem something like a hybrid of medieval dragon, alien and predator, with a tinge of the overgrown shrimp from the brilliant (and much more fun) Korean flick [[ASIN:B000PKG8TW The Host]].
B0000042MY|4.0|I definitely like the music on this one, but ... wish I had done a wee bit more research. I personally believe The Last of the Mohicans (1992 Film) [Motion Picture Score] is more complete ... the some of the songs are longer.
B002AOWXQ8|2.0|So I think others already commented on the joyful and fun music. Five stars for that.    But unfortunately, the sounds quality is awful. Instruments somewhere in a cloud, imprecise base, voices seem to be recorded from meters away. On top of that, highly compressed.  So it is good for creating a 96kbit MP3 out of it and listen in the bus, but it hurts listening on anything larger than cheap computer speakers.    So PLEASE Ed, get some sound engineer knowing what (s)he is doing. Then it is fun listening.  Low rating because of sound quality.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|WALL-E is still my favorite Pixar movie to date and having it on Blu-ray now is awesome. I really like how many extras are on the disc and if you have kids they will love the games. For the price it was way worth it.

1400052173|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is science writing for the broad market at its best. The source of the almost ubiquitous HeLa cells and their contributions to medical advancements is expertly linked to the saga both of the woman from whom the original cells were obtained and her descendants who spent years knowing nothing of the importance those cells have had for us all.    By delving into the human side of the story, searching out and listening to the family of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot has given us unique insight into an area of medical and scientific ethics that still has to be worked out.     Who \\"owns\\" the tissue cultures and samples after they are taken from our bodies for testing or analysis? When there are medical advances that come about as a result of the use of these cells, who in the entire chain of research and development should be able to share in any profits that may result? Is there a reasonable and workable way to track the origin of all the many cells/tissues that are required to fully develop solutions and cures for diseases and disorders?    Though it is clear where her sympathies lie, Skloot does not take a specific position on the issue of cell ownership. Instead, she has written a narrative that provides much grist for discussion and encourages further study of a situation that has long been ignored. In the bargain, she has also given us a great read. This is definitely a book I am recommending to my friends.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie is one of Tim Burton's best films so far! We have owned the DVD since it was released and I just bought it on BluRay! We just watched Mr. Burton's Alice in Wonderland and it was great!!! We own that too now. I love Tim Burton's films - the acting, the musical score (Danny Elfman), the stories are magical and fabulous, and the visuals are spectacular! The cinematography perfect. He makes magic happen with every film! There are many - check out his works!

B000PY30JE|5.0|One of the most sensual Jazz Albums ever made, Chet by Chet Baker is simply divine. The cover says it all. Romantic, sophisticated and melancholy, Chet's velvet trumpet sounds make this an intoxicating dreamy soundscape. Simply a refined resonance of a more delicate mood, it's perfect for those occasions when you don't want a brash obtrusive soundscape. The first tune - Alone Together, seduces you to listen intently, yet in an exquisite way, sets the ambience for this whole CD. How High The Moon is upbeat, toe tapping and if I knew the words, I would gladly sing along, but love to hum along instead. It Never Entered My Mind and September Song are meshed with the fine elements of Bill Evans masterful piano along with Connie Kay & Philly Joe Jones slow, almost erotic tempo on drums, making these songs some of my favorites. Early Morning Mood ends off with an effervescent melody that almost says: \\"thanks for coming/listening, hope you enjoyed your stay.\\"<br /><br />Close your eyes and imagine a bygone era - where men wore classic fedoras, women looked elegant in elbow length gloves and a Martini was about the sexiest drink you could order. Close your eyes and imagine a dark smoke filled nightclub with velvet upholstered chairs, bartenders who would call you Sir or Madame, and see Chet and his band up on stage underneath the glow of a few spotlights. This is the soundtrack to that dream.
B000SMWUPS|2.0|This was very useful to me for about a month and a half. It holds your coffee, keys, phone etc...  and it seemed pretty sturdy but the strap broke off. Even considering the cheap price this shouldn't have broke after only a month as i didn't put much weight at all in it.
0060730552|2.0|After reading Alive, I was told that I have to read this book.  It sounded like something I'd really enjoy.  The story is indeed amazing.  The writing style however is very technical.  Joe Simpson goes on and on describing every little detail to such an extent that it was hard for me to follow.  The characters were poorly developed.  I don't really know the details of what happened, and I feel after reading the whole book that I don't know much more than what the back cover revealed.    You have to be an experienced mountaineer to follow along.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|I had the chance to attend 4 concerts during the 2009 North America leg of the tour and it was an amazing experience. The quality of the production is amazing, being able to see the concert from different angles and perspectives is what makes this DVD a great video. The Tour by itself is awesome, with a monumental stage, an impressive light and sound show with the best band in the world. It is a Must have.
0307266303|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I'm not a runner at all, but I have to say that reading about these super-humans really inspired me to give it a try.  The book is written well for just reading, and the characters were all described very well.
B0023RSZLY|5.0|Halberstam's last book, The Coldest Winter. . . is a complex telling of the history of Korea and how it has become intermixed with the histories of six nations, China, Japan, the US, Russia, North and South Korea.  Maybe if things had happened a little differently 60 or 70 years ago, we wouldn't be sitting through another bout of saber rattling from North Korea.  Halberstam's focus is not the big battles and big names per se, although they play their own particular roles, rather he concentrates on the men at the points of the arrows on the maps that is most intriguing and moving.  Not the generals who, in some cases made huge and deadly mistakes which their men paid for.  Rather he is looking at and into the men who were the squad leaders, platoon sergeants and company, battalion, and regimental commanders.  The corporals, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, majors, lieutenant colonels and colonels who had to  recieve the charges of masses of North Korean and Chinese troops, fight them and in many cases die amongst them.  Some of these men  saw their military career end on the crest of a hill or the bank of a river whre they were wounded.  Others survived to fight in future wars. Major Hal Moore who surived to fight at the Ia Drang in Vietnam 15 years later. Colonel Harold Johnson, who survived captivity as a POW in  Japan and survived Korea, went on to become the Army Chief of Staff as America built up forces in Vietnam to suppport a creaking and resented government.  It is the snapshots of these men that makes the book such a superb history.  Decisions made in Washington, Beijing, Tokyo and Moscow have an effect that is seen through the actions of these and other men on the ground.  There are also dramatic scenes of senior officers who failed the test of combat as it found them in their leadership positions.  A divison commander is essentially fired for loosing control of his division while a regimental commander is publicly dismissed from his command by  the assistant division commander.  Halberstam goes into great detail to examine the leadership style and situation of the Eighth Army Commander, Lt Gen Walton Walker.  It turned out he was fighting battles both in Korea and Tokyo and while holding his own in Korea was rapidly loosing the battle between himself and General MacArthur.  General Walker's contribution to stemming the rout in Korea and preventing a bigger disaster than had already occurred has been buried in history and Halberstam does him a great service by bringing forth his actions which helped save the Republic of South Korea at its most desperate hour.  Halberstam examines the military leaders of the North Korean and Chinese forces - especially the later who were sent into Korea to bail out the routed North Korean forces.  One US general(in a very senior position in Korea) referred to the Chinese soldiers as &#34;laundrymen&#34; and by doing so hazarded the lives of the soldiers, Marines and Sailors under his command.  If he had paid greater attention to who he was fighing, his subsequent retreat from the Chosin Resevoir might have been a very different story.  It is especially ironic to see what became of the senior Chinese general in Korea later in his career and during the reign of terror of the &#34;Red Guards&#34; during the cultural revolution.  Halberstam also, in great detail describes the political situation in the US - the changes and upheavals in domestic politics which impacted various people in government, Marshall, Acheson, Truman, Bradley, MacArthur and many others who made up the political-military echelon of US government.  He also goes into the complex relationships between , Syngman Rhee, Chang Kai Chek, Kim Il Sung, Mao Tse Tung and Josef Stalin as they are drawn into the complex peninsula known as Korea.  This book has been reviewed at length by many others.  Some critics focus on Halberstam's mistakes in nomenclature or weapons or points on the map.  While valid, they in no way should obscure the fact that this is a book that is talking about people and their experiences and we need to hear what they are saying.  We need to see what was happening when men in Washington who knew better allowed the theater commander, Generla Douglas MacArthur to dictate military policy on his own terms.  Matthew Ridgeway, a lieutenant general and just a little bit below the highest level asks one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff why they allowed MacArthur to dictate to them.  The &#34;Chief&#34; replies that there was nothing they could do&#34;.  When General Ridgway says &#34;you could have fired him&#34;, the &#34;Chief&#34; just looked stunned.  The story of the relief of General MacArthur is a small drama in itself and one that would be good of PBS to air.  Truman in this moment certainly epitomises his belief that &#34;the buck stops here&#34;.  It was suggested at one point that the message be sent that it was a joint decision between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President.  Truman shuts the plan down and insists  that he make the announcement as his and only his decision to relieve General MacArthur.  If there is one take home lesson from this book - it is know your enemy.  We see the consequences when this precept is ignored or minimized.  Unfortunately it is a lesson that has seemed to have been lost on executive leadership in Washington over the last half century and is only relearned at the expense of troops on the ground.  I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Korea, Asia and American policies there and also how this same type of thinking is leading us as we try to salvage something out of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Fortunately there have been no battles equivilant to Koto-ri or evacuations of the Chosen Resevoir in either country but the effects of decisions in Washington on military men and women and civilians in these two countries show similarities that are disturbing.  I highly recommend this outstanding book.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|Boy I had no idea I would like this CD so much, especially after listening to it a couple of times. Being a fan of Stan Getz I really appreciate this CD for what it is. Never heard Sinatra in this light before. I recommend this CD highly.

B000VL9XE2|3.0|I just got this album and I have found quite a bit of variety in it.  This cd seems to be divided into 3 types of tracks:  - Really good songs like Milk Lizard, Black Bubblegum, and Dead as History (it seems a lot fans hate these because \\"theyre too commercial\\" which i find stupid. just because a song is catchy, doesnt mean the band is selling out or trying to appeal to the mainstream. let bands experiment with what they want)  - Bizarre but pretty cool semi-electronic instrumentals like When Acting as a Wave  - And the songs with screaming behind really technical but annoying music like Fix your Face and Lurch. i just cant get into these ones i guess.  I really find it annoying how this band are such good musicians and seem quite open minded and willing to experiment but keep coming back to that annoying metalcore style or whatever the hell you call, but thats just my opinion after all.  but i think it was a worth while purchase overall and i might get their newest album, but i havnt decided yet.
B000003ER4|5.0|Korngold was barely out of his teens when he completed the operatic masterpiece Die Tode Stadt (and he already had two superb operas behind him). Yet it is a fully mature, ingeniously crafted and technically well neigh perfect score - opulent and colorfully late-romantic, superbly scored (often with a frankly eerie touch to it), always harmonically interesting and well-written for the voices, and containing several wonderful numbers and plenty of luxuriously shaded, often magical atmospheres. Listen, for instance, to the rapt and otherworldly beautiful characterizing the Marietta character and the use of light and shade to describe Paul's shifting psychological states. Still, it is generally with the orchestral music and the choral and orchestral numbers, particularly the preludes to the various acts, that Korngold really excels, although the most powerful scene of all must be the scene where Marietta tries to banish the ghost of Marie, with an approaching religious procession appearing slowly from the distance, culminating in the almost dizzying conflict with Paul.    René Kollo's Paul is one of the main attractions; perhaps a little to heroic for the role, but the authoritative, characterful and brilliant yet sensitive singing still makes for a superb listening experience. Benjamin Luxon's Frank is in a fine voice with surprisingly spare use of vibrato. Hermann Prey sings wonderfully, of course, but he is a tad too impassionate for his character, and comes across as solemn rather than yearning. Carol Neblett's Marietta is as sparkly and spirited as one could hope for, and her duets with Kollo must count among the highlights of operatic singing on disc. Rose Wagemann provides Brigitta with a warm and loverly mezzo.    Leinsdorf conducts a full-blooded performance; the sound of the Munich Radio Orchestra is full and warm and full of character and atmosphere. The subtle shifts and moves between light and dark are marvelously handled, as is - in particular - the feverish, dreamlike sequences where Paul's ability to distinguish dreams and images from reality becomes tenuous; the music is truly given all the golden hue and smoldering fire it asks for. And the sound quality is magnificent throughout. I haven't heard any alternative recordings of this splendid work, but cannot imagine that they will surpass this one; very strongly recommended.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|One more reason that this version is vastly inferior to the BBC Version. Although the colours and narration are spectacular; For the love of the FSM please stop it with the \\"Americanization\\" of these amazing programmes (see what I did there, I used an English version of a word which will still be understood by Americans). I have many of them in my blu-ray catalogue.

Hsieh is a great writer and I found myself not wanting to put the book down.     It is a very user friendly written book for anyone to read, and learn from. I love the worm story and the 976 numbers. I was laughing out loud.    Highly recommend this book.

0143038419|1.0|I listened to the entire unabridged audiobook read by the author. I felt the India section (PRAY) was the most moving and insightful and taught the most. The author is so self-centered at times I wanted to toss the book aside.  The reader gets the sense Gilbert doesn't want children because she'd have to focus on them not herself, and this seems to be a problem. It's somewhat pathetic the way she wallows over her divorce - which SHE wanted and asked for. It wasn't enough for her to have a huge house and everything she ever wanted (which she mentions again and again).  But my main complaints with this book are:    1) she is a writer/journalist who received a $200k advance to travel for a year and write a product, this book, - talk about contrived,   2) get busy, millions of women go through divorce every day.   3) she thinks too much, talk about a \\"busy\\" mind...,   4) she seems ADHD and can't ever seem to stick with anything.   5) her relationships felt shallow, temporary and self-serving. She doesn't even share a goodbye to Katut at the end of her book.  Instead the ending is all about her proclaimed \\"Brazillian Lover\\", and a flashback to her trip to the same romantic island years before. Oh brother.     I cannot give a good review. I think everything she learned in India is lost on her divorced/journalist/mercenary soul.  I purchased the book thinking it was a travelogue journey of self-discovery, but it didn't end up that way in the end.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|Endgame is good, but I found myself listening to it over and over looking for that one song that just clicks. You know the song, the one you here on an album/CD and its the first song you want to here every time you put the CD in!?! My personal opinion, it doesn't compare with The System Has Failed which I think was their best since Rust in Peace. Musically, Megadeth shreds the frets right off of their guitars. But sometimes, that's not all that matters to everyone. Not that the lyrics are bad, the songs just don't have that \\"Hook in mouth\\" catch to them. Don't get me wrong, even so so Megadeth is better than NO Megadeth!!!!! Rock on!<br />R.I.P DIME
1423113381|5.0|I read any book I think that might be iffy for my kids. That is how I discovered I liked reading Percy Jackson as much as I like Harry Potter. So when the school librarian told us that that Rick Riordan had a new book coming out, I was just as excited as my kids. \\"The Red Pyramid\\" does not disappoint. It is action packed, without being too scary. The main characters and their parents willing make sacrifices for the good of their family (and the world). The brother and sister learn to rely on each other. Plus, I really like the fact that the hero siblings aren't the standard Caucasian male lead. The brother and sister are equally important and courageous. The book is narrated by both the Kane sibling, so the reader gets both points of view. Their dad is African-American and their mom is a Caucasian Englishwoman.   This is a great book. I would recommend this book for anyone over 11 and anyone  over 9 that isn't bothered by action and a the characters being in peril.

B003A3K3JW|5.0|Okay, so.. ah, um ... yes, ... I'm a rabid fan of rising young star conductor Gustavo Dudamel.  Yet...    I've so far felt that his recordings showed high promise without really leaving me all that deeply touched, satiated with energy and/or insight, or musically overwhelmed.  I began to take it for granted that, well, maybe: Dudamel is one of those artists in the making whose live concerts offer something that is quite difficult to capture in most recording sessions, even sometimes in live concert recording sessions.  I've enjoyed Dudamel's discs - who can spin any of those releases without nodding in happy approval of the Simon Bolivar Youth Symphony Orchestra?  Still, not one of the releases to date grabbed such hold of me that I knew that disc was a slam dunk lasting keeper.    Now, we've arrived.  Put the praiseful commentaries up in neon lights, soundtracked by megaphoned audiences applauding.  This disc really convinces me.  I take it as, at least the first, earliest high pinnacles of what now comes across like a boundless musical enthusiasm - from conductor and from youth orchestra.  Plus, that enthusiasm sounds here to be matched to some impactful realization of sheer musical understanding.  The Rite of Spring gives off a heady sense that mountain climbing and rock climbing may have much more in common with music making than we ordinarily credit, when we are opposing arts to sports.  Le Sacre du Printemps, an extreme sport?    Let's start with obvious comparisons.  I cannot imagine any youth orchestra, anywhere in the world, who would not be plenty happy to have had a widely distributed master tape that captured a similarly compelling-energized recorded reading of either Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps or Revueltas' La Noche de las Mayas.  At least for these sessions, the SBYSO seems entirely involved and nearly unerring.  My fav shelf already gave pride of shelf place to the Junge Deutsche Philharmonie in their Mahler under Barshai (fifth, tenth symphonies).  If you do not own those discs, what are you waiting for?  Those JDP readings are so close to lightning in a recording session bottle.  As Mahler, and as orchestral performance.    Now, Simon Bolivar lifts up high, so high, right alongside the JDP Mahler set.  White hot.  Readings like these hardly arrive from professional bands a lot of the time, let alone from youth orchestras.    Next up a notch, I can hardly imagine a strong regional band that would not be happy to play like SBYSO under Dudamel is playing here.  Nearly all the big name professional outfits will equal or surpass - by a tad - the tonal depth, finesse, or bottomless virtuosity conjured up by Stravinsky in Rite.  But few professional bands so far committed to disc have managed the sort of heart-felt, whole-hearted involvement that SBYSO gives this music, combined with such easeful-blistering virtuosity as we get, generously, overflowing.    Next up at notch, let's move to musical manners.  Dudamel has so mastered and so internalized Stravinsky that his gear changes sound out an unlikely mix of spontaneous flow, wise ritualization (just missed by many, many, ,many a virtuoso reading now available).  This gripping musical meld is capped off by the sort of brilliant, riotous color we used to regularly associate with the likes of Leopold Stokowski in Philadelphia.  Dudamel and Simon Bolivar never make a mis-step; yet still the piece comes off as more of a whole than many another very capable, virtuoso band reading.  The fact that this music is ballet music is never quite out of mind, such is the coherence and structure of the pacing throughout.    Ditto, for the signal companion work by Revueltas.  It often gets a stunning, virtuoso performance that bowls listeners over, just as the Stravinsky often does.  But it sometimes seems like more folk and local color, melded to innumerable modernist techniques for writing for the expanded modern orchestra - as much coming across as stunning noise as stunning music - trailblazing, thundering out through the same wide open barn doors as the likes of Edgard Varese, Henry Cowell, Harry Partch, John Cage, Stockhausen, Xenakis.    Here, we get even more than brilliance and path-breaking noise as sound as music.  The rhythm is key to the magic being conjured in the Revueltas, just as it seems in retrospect with the Stravinsky Rite.  I dare anybody with another reading on their fav shelves to play it better as warm ritual celebration than Dudamel and Simon Bolivar.    Short of Barcelona-Catalunya, Simon Bolivar is making a bid in this recording to be considered one of the finest bands now playing in the Spanish-speaking halls of the global music world.  Their startling virtuosity and free-wheeling energy are not so much the deeper, lingering surprise, as much as their deepening musicianship.  !Que Viva, El Sistema!    So yes, go get the JDP in Mahler if you do not already own that set.  And seriously consider adding this white hot fire cracker of a pocket rocket to the same youth orchestra shelves.  The only thing that could improve this reading to my ears would be if we have a super audio surround sound mastering, waiting some day in the wings to be finished, pressed, released.    As it is, this PCM stereo disc easily rises to fancy music rig demonstration status.  I bet that everybody from twelve years to twenty-two will end up spinning this one.  Ipods, salute.  Ear buds will never be the same again?  Dudamel's Stravinsky rubs shoulders with Michael Tilson Thomas and the Boston Symphony, or with Eugene Goosens and the LSO (remastered in DVD audio), or with Antal Dorati in Detroit.  I think the Revueltas simply now tops the list of available readings.    I would like to hear all the Carlos Chavez symphonies, provided we get to hear them played by Dudamel and the SBYSO serving up the sort of depth of musical internalization that is on display here in the Revueltas and in the Stravinsky.  I'm hypnotized, grandpa gone cattywampus: Five Stars. Five stars. Five stars. Five stars.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|The words of the title for my review are uttered by Margaret Hale, the heroine of the lush BBC miniseries, North and South, when she described the cotton factories in the fictional town of Milton, in the industrial north of England. The South in the title refers to the prosperous and more 'refined' south of England, including London.<br /><br />There are 454 reviews of this wonderful miniseries as I write this.  I'm sure somewhere in those 454 reviews, there is at least one or two synopses of the plot.  So I won't go over well-trod soil.  But I will comment on the acting, the cinematography, and the art direction.<br /><br />The acting is superb.  Richard Armitage plays John Thornton, the owner of one of the vast, busy, and almost inhumane cotton mills in Milton.  Armitage has a extensive background as an actor, primarily in British television, most notably 'MI-5'.  Daniela Denby-Ashe plays the aforementioned Ms. Hale.  She's a capable actress, and lends a solid presence to the role.  Also notable is Hale's father, the disillusioned preacher who leaves the Church of England on a matter of conscience, played by veteran actor Tim Pigott-Smith (Robert Merrick in the excellent 'The Jewel in the Crown).<br /><br />The cinematography is second-to-none.  It captures the grime of the city, the bleak working and living places of the masses (and that is an apt word to describe how those unfortunate souls are treated), and the fine clumps of cotton that float ever-present through the factories.  (The 'snow white of hell' that Hale describes at the end of the first episode.)  The art direction is also excellent.  It's just as you'd imagine a Dickens city to be.<br /><br />This is a superior effort, with lots of money to back it up.  Milton does look like an Earthly version of Hades, with the exploitation of workers, extreme poverty and widespread child labor.  It's also a very interesting look at English history, lightly covered in other films, regarding the fantastic changes in the lives of the English as the industrial revolution took full hold. These are issues that Charles Dickens would tackle in many of his own works around the same time as the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, upon whose novel this miniseries is based.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that the life portrayed in Austen's novels is only a couple of decades prior to this gritty work.<br /><br />Very Highly recommended.  This is the type of work you look forward to watching, and sad when it ends.  It's a winning effort, and I give it a full five stars.  I look forward to watching it again.  Bravo!the industrial revolution took full hold.

B002E01LUM|3.0|Okay, with my recent upgrading of my home entertainment system, and my discovery of the benefits of \\"anamorphic widescreen\\" transfers, I've been updating my movie collection where necessary.  For the most part, movies that I have in \\"anamorphic widescreen\\" look very nice, even at standard-DVD resolution (a few bad transfers out there cause problems, that this is the exception, not the rule!)    \\"Anamorphic widescreen\\" basically is a recorded image in widescreen.  \\"Non-anamorphic widescreen\\" was popular for a while, where they'd actually record a 4:3 image with black top-and-bottom bars in the image itself.  If you only had a 4:3 standard-definition TV, you'd never be able to tell the difference, and it made for cheaper DVD production.  But with 16:9 high-def monitors, these DVDs are... unacceptable.  You get a 4:3 image, with big black areas to either side...  and the 4:3 image has black areas top and bottom.  Basically, you get a sea of black with a half-size-ish \\"widescreen\\" image in the middle.  Ugh.    So, I've been updating my movies to true-widescreen format.  In some cases, to \\"anamorphic widescreen\\" DVD, and in some cases, to blu-ray.  (Mainly dependent on the availability of a good-quality transfer in one or the other format...)  In this case, I couldn't find a decent DVD but found a well-rated Blu-Ray transfer... this one.    This is actually a Canadian product, not a \\"USA-native\\" product.  I did not know that when I bought it, but I have no real complaints over that.  It's one of several I bought from Amazon which were, surprisingly, Canadian issues rather than USA issues.  I mention this because it's possible that the USA transfer (if it exists) may be slightly different.    Okay, first things first - each Canadian Blu-Ray I've gotten has been very \\"bare bones.\\"  There are NO extras on this disk.  Then again, the only extra on the DVD was the theatrical trailer, so in this case, it's no real loss.  Also, Canadian disks seen to have only English and French.  This is no problem for me, but if you're looking for other languages, don't buy this disk.    Now...  the video transfer is very good.  It's not \\"perfect\\" but I suspect that the little defects I was able to pick out were due to the master's condition when the transfer was made.  So, while I couldn't necessary pick out the pores on an actor's nose, I don't really care to see that level of detail anyway!  The entire movie is very dark... by intent... and too much \\"clarity\\" might actually ruin the \\"stranded in the dark\\" effect somewhat.  In other movies, this might be an issue, however.    The sound quality is fine.  This disk has Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks in English and French, and also the original track in DTS-HD Master Audio (English, obviously).  There's a lot of strange reverb in the \\"underground\\" sequences, and I think that's by design.  Let's just say that the DTS-HD soundtrack is a bit better than the Dolby Digital 5.1 track, but not substantially so.  Unless you have a full 7.1 surround-sound system with a huge subwoofer, you probably won't notice too much difference.    As for the movie itself...  well, this is a \\"popcorn movie.\\"  It's not something that'll capture your attention for years to come, but it's fun to watch, with a good mixture of scares and thrills, and some pretty slick creature designs, and with characters who are, for the most part, people we come to care about during the film (the main exception, for me, being the apparently-autistic kid...  who really added nothing to the movie as far as I'm concerned and was just there to tweak the emotions of some folks, I suppose).  Without giving any spoilers, it's another riff on the old, tried-and-true \\"Nothing good happens from playing God\\" idea.  No huge surprises...  but it's, as I said, a \\"fun popcorn flick.\\"
B0021L8V1G|4.0|In this sequel , Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is up against an ingenious Russian (Mickey Rourke) that wants revenge on the Stark family for having his father deported from America. While a rich weapons manufacturer (Sam Rockwell) wants to use Rourke to build him Iron Man suits since Stark won't give his up to the government. While Stark has to find a new energy source that can keep him alive and isn't too confident that he can. But Stark's military friend (Don Cheadle) is more than ready to step in his shoes with the War Machine outfit.<br /><br />  The movie is as slow as the first to pick up and give us some action. The first is a little better though since it doesn't take as long to give us some action. Plus some viewers might find the end fight to be too short and not even as good as the end fight of the first film. Still, I wouldn't call Iron Man 2 a disappointment, the movie is far better than a lot of the summer movies that came out last summer, like Transformers 2. Transformers 2 had a lot more action, but it was too loud and un-involving.<br /><br />  When I watching the first Iron Man yesterday, I realized that Stark should have at least looked more in pain and weak after the operation that removed half his chest. I mean his body took too it too well I thought. So what I really liked about Iron Man 2 is that his body is starting to have a negative reaction to what saved his life in the first film. It was also nice to see more comic book characters in this sequel like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Whiplash (Mickey Rourke).
B001ECDVYK|4.0|I finally got around to transforming my home entertainment center into a full HD experience late last year, with the final step (a new Sony blu-ray player... 3D capable w. built-in wireless) occurring just weeks ago.    When I upgraded the TV from a picture-tube unit (albeit a very nice one) to a big flat-panel HD monitor, I discovered what \\"anamorphic widescreen\\" really meant.  Far too many of my favorite movies, which always look \\"right\\" on my standard-def 4:3 tube, suddenly were totally inadequate on a 1080p 240hz high-def monitor.  For anyone who's not familiar with it, you may have noticed it once or twice...  \\"non-anamorphic widescreen\\" means that the image is actually recorded in 4:3 image ratio, with the \\"black bars\\" actually being part of the recorded image!  So, play a \\"non-anamorphic widescreen\\" movie on a widescreen display, and you get a 4:3 image (including black areas) in the middle, with big black areas on either side as well...  basically, a postage-stamp image of the movie in the middle of a sea of black!  NOT acceptable...  (and there's no excuse for egomaniacs like James Cameron REFUSING to allow upgraded versions of their movies ...  \\"Titanic,\\" \\"The Abyss,\\" \\"True Lies,\\" and so forth...  unless they, personally, oversee the entire transfer process...  hence why none of those flicks have decent transfers yet!)    SO...  I discovered that my DVD of \\"From Dusk Til Dawn\\" was non-anamorphic.  And I decided to upgrade it to a blu-ray disk.    Now, this disk is a \\"Canadian\\" disk...  which surprised me a bit.  There may be a \\"domestic USA\\" version which is different, but this is the one I bought from Amazon, so that's what I'm reviewing.  (I had no idea that it was \\"Canadian\\" until it arrived, by the way.)    Okay...  so, here are the PROS:    1)  This is a truly beautiful transfer.  The image is perfect, as far as I can tell.  I saw no artifacts, no noise, no blur... nothing.  This actually looked better than it did when I saw it on the big screen.  I'drate the image as a 9.5/10 (and thats' simply because I never rate anything as \\"perfect\\").    2)  The sound is also a wonderful transfer.  My home theater system allows full HD audio (in this case, DTS-HD Master Audio, though I also have Dolby TrueHD capability, which is a bit less common but sounds at least as good as DTS-HD MA).  Using the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, it sounded very nice...  but using the DTS-HD track, it was phenomenal.  (Mind you, I have a very nice 7.1 sound system...  if you're going off the TV speakers, you almost certainly won't hear any difference between the two!)  The surround effects were well-used...  hearing \\"bat wings\\" fluttering behind my recliner, clearly moving from one side of my living room to the other, was pretty impressive!    So, the movie itself is nearly perfect.    But there are a few CONS:    1)  There are ZERO \\"extras\\" on this disk.  I know that there were extras on the DVD... I've got it right here.  It's a shame that they chose not to provide those on this disk.    2)  As a \\"Canadian\\" disk, this has the original English soundtrack (Dolby Digital, and DTS-HD MA, as described before).  It also has a French Dolby Digital soundtrack.  But that's it.  This is perfect for me, but if you're buying it in the USA, you're going to get some other language choices (for instance, you'll almost certainly get Spanish).    SO...  if you only want to watch the movie, in the original form and with the original sound, in the best possible quality, this is a wonderful choice.  If you're one of those who likes \\"extras\\" as part of your entertainment purchases, you'll be disappointed in that part of it.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Finally - a Bond to make us forget the awful performances of Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan.  Craigs cold, introverted, ruthless presentation of 007 is truly something to behold.  The entire film has you clamoring for what's underneath his pokerfaced facade.  Gone are the goofy gadgets and gizmos, the silly puns and one liners (well, almost all of them), and the comic book villains.  Le Chiffre is truly evil and maniacal.  A few traditional Bond brands have, happily, been retained, such as Walther and Aston-Martin (and OMG what a car), although the Rolex has been replaced with an Omega. The action is edge-of-seat and original, and the extras disk is eye-opening with regard to the production and stunts - as much fun to watch as the feature.  There is a bit of a stall about 3/4 of the way through, and the end seems to taper off a bit, but, on a whole, this 007 feature is the star in the crown of the Fleming film franchise and bears repeated watching. Framed with a great opening number and a hot new rendition of the classic Bond theme for the end credits, this one is worth..\\"every penny of it\\". Even Connery's legendary performance is starting to fade a bit....

B001HN694K|4.0|ALICE IN WONDERLAND  is a merry mixed bag of a film.  The criticisms range from adulation to condemnation and that usually identifies an artwork worth visiting.  No, this is not Lewis Carroll's wondrous book intact: it s a variation on a theme of that book and there are so many aspects of the original here that those whose childhoods (and adulthoods) captured so much of the wild imagination and hilarious dialogue of this ma group of otherland creations that the film will at least connect on many levels to everyone.  One suspects that with the manner in which the movie begins (a haughty 'engagement announcement' party at which the now 19 year old Alice Kingsleigh is set up to become betrothed to a dullard geek and runs from the gazebo setting out of dismay) is the reason for the restoration of individualism in the Alice that returns from slide down the rabbit hole return to Wonderland.  Linda Woolverton's screenplay is creaky at times, but wisely keeps enough of the fantasy alive before drowning it in an ending that is perilously close to gluttonous CGI mess.<br /><br />The flavor is pure Tim Burton and his style fits this adaptation well.  To justify the return of the elder Alice to the world at the end of the rabbit hole Burton has to have a driver: Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is needed to evict the evil Red Queen (Helen Bonham Carter so that the good White Queen (a miscast Anne Hathaway) can restore calm and order to Underland.  Many of Carroll's characters are used as CGI creations - Tweedledum/Tweedledee (voice of Matt Lucas), Cheshire Cat (voice of Stephen Fry), the White Rabbit (voice of Michael Sheen), the Blue Caterpillar (a wonderful voice character for Alan Rickman), the talking Flowers (voice of Imelda Staunton), and the hound dog Bayard (voice of Timothy Spall), etc.  The Mad Hatter is well captured by Johnny Depp and some genuine realism is added via the transformative presence of Marton Csokas as the young Alice's now departed father Charles Kingsleigh.<br /><br />Where the movie gets off track is the final battle with the monsters that protect the Red Queen.  It just gets expensively silly here and certainly not a film for young children: the violence is disturbing.  But there is enough to like in this DVD version - even without the advantage (I suppose there was one) of theatrical 3D.  And as Alice keeps reminding everyone, 'This is MY dream.'

B003C1QIO6|5.0|Just as the tempature hits 100 degrees here in Vegas, Jack Johnson releases another album that transports me a much cooler place.  Nobody does beach music like Jack Johnson and no matter that the ocean is 5 hours away To The Sea has me smelling the ocean breeze and I can almost hear the sea gulls.  To the Sea is no different than his previous albums and in my opinion any song could be on any of his previous albums but the songs are new and as always very catchy.  After two listens I was already singing along to at least half the songs.  At some point Jack Johnson is going to evolve and grow as an artist but for now I am happy with another album of more of the same from Jack Johnson, I feel cooler already.
B0002XMF62|5.0|As much as Sharon Osbourne has made her life quest to convince the world that post-Ozzy Sabbath was completely worthless and irrelevant, we real metalheads know better than to listen to that disgusting old hag's rants.<br />So, after putting out two absolute classics with Dio (Heaven and Hell and The Mob Rules) and a great, but somewhat flawed album with Gillan (Born Again), the band's Butler-Iommi composing team disintegrated, leaving Black Sabbath as little more than a Tony Iommi solo showcase in 1986's Seventh Star. After this ill-fated album, the once mighty Sabbath's fate up to 1992's Dehumanizer would be a struggle between commercial obscurity and artistic irrelevancy, despite crafting a masterpiece with The Eternal Idol and two decent follow ups.<br />Of the five ill-fated Tony Martin albums, this is undoubtedly the best. After the softer, hard rock oriented Seventh Star, the band feels rejuvenated and hell bent on recapturing their long lost heavy metal thunder.<br />Despite a hodgepodge of backing musicians and personel problems during the album's production, Tony Iommi's monumentally heavy riffing, coupled with Tony Martin's Dio-esque vocals on tracks like Hard Life to Love, Glory Ride, and Born to Lose manage to keep the music focused, hard and heavy. Geoff Nicholls, Sabbath's perpetually invisible fifth member, does an excellent job throghout with his eery, atmospheric keyboards, especially on The Eternal Idol and Ancient Warrior. That said, the absolute masterpiece on this album is The Shining, a monumental Sabbath stomper that deserves a place in the band's greatest songs pantheon.<br />Make no mistake. Tony Iommi is, was and will always be Black Sabbath's dark soul regardless on who's handling the vocals, and despite this being the band's most underrated opus, it still stands as an all-time heavy metal masterpiece and a monument to the left-handed riffmaster's musical vision.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I just returned from seeing Sex And The City 2 and I thought it was great. Please don't listen to the mostly male critics who for some reason find it great sport to bag on this movie. It was a feast for the senses. The music was wonderful, the flowing clothes on the women against the heat of the desert sand, and yes the opulence all made for a blissful escape. For anybody that moans \\"we are in a recession\\" get over it, its a movie. I thought the story was fun, imaginative and thought provoking in the end. If you can watch it and not go \\"ahhh\\" at the scene where Carrie goes for a walk on the beach...her dress, the flags ,the umbrella...beautiful. Don't be a lemming and repeat \\"Oh, Ive heard its not good\\", because you have heard wrong.
B00319ECC4|5.0|This is simply what Fear Factory should have recorded after Demanufacture, their breakthrough album which aside from being an undisputed 90s metal classic still sounds as fresh and powerful as it did back in 1995. Alas, the band would cave in to Roadrunner's commercial ambitions and attempt a more radio-friendly sound in 1998's dissapointing Obsolete and 2001's embarrasing Digimortal to break up acrimonioulsy shortly after the latter. In 2004, the band attempted a comeback without Dino Cazares which was received very coldly by the band's fan base, and after 2005's experimental (and ultimately underwhelming) Transgression, it appeared our beloved cyber metal pioneers were gone for good... until now.<br />Mechanize brings back all that was great about Fear Factory back in the day (namely, the precise, patented, machine-gun like Dino Cazares riffs, the pulverizing pseudo industrial drumming and Burton C. Bell's unmistakeable mix of clean and agressive vocals) with great songwriting, a stellar production and some rythmic curveballs here and there courtesy of monster drummer Gene Hoglan.<br />Fear Factory is back, get used to it.

030745455X|5.0|I think that Larsson managed to successfully capture the story in this sequel.  It is quite an example of the lush storytelling that Larsson's fiction has to offer. This book is fascinating, funny, heartbreaking and brilliant. The characters are so human and so true you never question the reality of their existence. The story tells of one young woman's defiance of social convention. The Girl Who Played with Fire offers much: memorable heros, strong heroines, vicious enemies, gripping situations and above all, prose that is so lovely I was absolutely floored. This author has managed to deal with the issues of the sex trade, corrupt police, physical abuse, and the media with so much audacity and yet still manages to refrain from preaching one side or the other; he clearly shows us horrible cruelty and the people affected. Even when dealing with such controversial subjects, he never fails to make you chuckle on top of the suffering. It is the ultimate roller coaster of emotions.<br /><br />There are so many wonderful things to say about The Girl Who Played with Fire. Firstly I think Mr. Larsson's writing is truly superior, and it is what makes this book unique and special. I have not read any of Mr. Larsson's other books, but if they are similar to this one, I certainly intend to in the very near future. I appreciated his writing style and, I was quite surprised by how beautiful and open his writing is. Reading this book was a different kind of celebration for me because it takes place in Sweden. I am just so pleased that I could enjoy an entire afternoon absorbing this book and appreciating the captivating prose. I absolutely treasured each and every exquisite page. Not one word is wasted, not one shred of sentimentality is offered, with fully drawn characters and a plot that grips until the end. And the end? Again, one of the best I have ever, ever read. In short, I would do anything to have this man's ability. What shivered my heart with intellectual delight upon first falling into Larsson's rhythm, was that his style was so easy, and his silky dialogue was so appropriate. As far as I'm concerned, all the accolades are more than deserved. Reviewed by: C.J. Good, Authorng into Larsson's rhythm, was that his style was so easy, and his silky dialogue was so appropriate.

She said I had to see it, so I got a case of Red Bull and said \\"Yes\\" to Yes Man.<br /><br />------------<br />Allison: [singing with her band, Munchausen's By Proxy] Don't call me past 11 PM, it won't happen again. You can call me at 10:59 but don't call me at 11 because that's my rule now.<br />========<br /><br />The plot is basically that Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) works in a bank where he just says \\"No\\" to everybody who wants a loan. Since his girlfriend dumped him he has become even more negative, saying \\"No\\" to virtually anything. His friends Peter (Bradley Cooper) and Rooney (Danny Masterson, Hyde from The 70's Show) are getting sick of him, especially when he blows off Peter's engagement party in spite of the open bar.<br /><br />------------<br />Carl Allen: [while watching Saw on DVD] Oh come on, you're halfway through, just snap it off already!<br />========<br /><br />Just when he has hit rock bottom he meets Nick (John Michael Higgins, Kath & Kim, Best in Show), an old friend who has changed his life since attending a seminar conducted by the charismatic Terrance (Terrance Stamp, Far From the Madding Crowd). Terrance singles him out of the crowd and gets him to agree to a covenant. He has up until now been saying \\"No\\" to life, but now he must say \\"Yes\\" instead. Once he begins doing this his life dramatically changes. Even if things start to go bad, it leads to something good. He meets the spontaneous Allison (Zooey Deschanel) and is in for the ride of his life.<br /><br />----------------------<br />Allison: [singing with her band, Munchausen's By Proxy] Have you met my friend Ian? He's a computer hacker. He helped me erase your MySpace page, and your band's MySpace page, and your FaceBook page. Happy networking a**hole!<br />=======<br /><br />Yes Man is right up there with the greatest Jim Carrey films. It has a serious concept, but doesn't skimp on the comedy. The Cable Guy was Carrey's Citizen Kane, as I have said many times before, but it was quite dark and not everyone \\"got\\" it. The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was another triumph, but Carrey was very low key in it, suppressing his inner Ace Ventura. The Truman Show was a noble experiment that failed. Too much high concept, not enough low brow humor. Man in the Moon was another failed experiment that paid homage to the edgy humor of Andy Kaufman but tried to wrap it up in a package that would entertain the lowest common denominator, which is a self-defeating proposition. Dumb & Dumber was in my opinion a masterpiece of the broad comedy Carrey does so well, unencumbered by any higher aspirations whatsoever. However, in Yes Man Carrey has found that sweet spot right in between broad comedy and a more serious film with a message.<br /><br />------------<br />Carl Allen: What I have to share is huge... and I want to share it with you.<br />========<br /><br />Yes Man is based on a book by British Author Danny Wallace who spent a year saying \\"Yes\\" to every proposition and question he was asked, and then wrote about the results. Carrey and Director Peyton Reed spent a lot of time developing the story and changing it to an American setting. Carrey was really inspired by the message of the film and acted without pay, though he would get a share of the profits. He gave it his all, even breaking some ribs in a stunt. The stunt woman for Zooey Deschanel also broke her hip while riding a scooter, so Zooey had to ride it herself. The whole cast really gave an outstanding effort with superb results. Rhys Darby played Carl's boss Norman, and I'll compare him to Peter Sellers at the risk of hyperbole.<br /><br />------------<br />Allison: [singing with her band, Munchausen's By Proxy] Don't call me past 11 PM, it won't happen again.

B002M2T1UO|1.0|1. DVD's had scratches / glue / etc.  Half of there were unwatchable.    2. THIS REALLY REALLY PISSED ME OFF.  This was a gift for my Korean speaking mother.  I was told there were Korean subtitles... and there were... FOR ONLY THE FIRST TWO SEASONS!!!?  How does this even happen!?    I was going to give this two stars, but back down to one for reminding me how horribly handled this package was.  My mom loved the show, but is terribly upset that she won't be able to finish the show because of the lack of subtitles.  =(
B003BOUKRU|3.0|This is the most self-indulgent documentary I've ever seen.  This is a home video basically.  She is very fugly when you look at her upclose without hair.  She's definitely an airhead.  I've never heard her say a word other than love, passion and heart.  Listen especially to her speech at that Asian press conference where she was asked to talk about \\"power.\\"  haha Having said that, I enjoyed it because I like some of her songs and watching her ride in her little plane with an oxygen mask on.  My favorite songs are It's All Coming Back and To Love You More.  I had tickets to one of the Vegas shows that she cancelled after the audience was sitting in their seats for an hour.  No medical breakthoughs when you see a crew of doctors shoving cameras in her mouth, she just likes the attention.  Her oxygen mask is a placebo.  This disc is the full 3 hour documentary.  The version in theatres was a 2 hour edit.  I like how the netflix description said she did all this while raising a child at the same time because we know she did all the work there!  haha.  I like it when she beats her chest and her fingers go spastic then she salutes!  Overall, it's a funny little flick and it actually shows a lot of full song performances from the tour.  It's very long though.
B001FB563E|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  But I also really liked \\"No Country For Old Men\\" (another movie based on the author of the book off of which this movie was based).  If you didn't like \\"No Country,\\" you probably won't like this.  It's definitely not all rainbows and warm fuzzies - but then, it IS a post-apocalyptic world.
B00355ORFG|5.0|This is a good investment because it has all the b-sides (that I know of) from around the world.  The DVD is 30 min. half of which is footage of their Tokyo promotional activities including brief clips of a small outdoor concert they did there.  The disc is playable on US players.  It is not in anamorphic though which is annoying when you watch the \\"Straight Though My Heart\\" video  which is filmed in a wide cinemascope and looks like a small postcard cut out on a widescreen tv.  The Asian subtitles can be turned off using your remote.  For some bizarre reason, the image of Jim Morrison on AJ's shirt is completely censored through the whole Bigger video and behind the scenes footage and it's very noticeable.

0307454541|5.0|The author is to the point.  When you read this book--and the next two--you get totally immersed in the characters, however.

It is certainly better than the typical mystery novel.
B0019N8P2W|3.0|I was so excited about this box set to come out. I'm a huge Daria fan!  First off I like the packaging it's nice and compact. I wish they had put an episode guide but oh well no big deal. I also don't even care that the music is different. In fact I don't even notice it.   However while I was watching the shows on Disc 4 Season 3 Ep. 302-310 (The one with Kevin and Brittany on the front) the episodes where all messed up. Only two would play (The Lost Girls and Daria!) and they skip around. None of them are in order. Where the beginning of the episode should start it would be half way through the episode.  HUGE disappointment. I want to take it back but I'm not sure they will do anything about it.    Other than that this set is awesome and I'm very glad they put it out.
B001E45XT4|4.0|OK, So the headset is wonderful. But the mic is way too sensitive I mean seriously Every time I have a Ceiling fan on or The AC is on It cuts out like a Cellphone On speaker this is my only gripe but they need to put a new mic on this thing...One that's not as sensitive.

0765348276|5.0|So at Mr. Scalzi's recommendation at the phoenix comic-con I picked up Old Man's War and I have to say I love this book. I've still half of it to go but it's very impressive so far. It's funny, it's good sci-fi, and it stimulates me intellectually.<br />One of the panel's that Mr. Scalzi was on it was either him or Michael Stackpole who pointed out that one of the main flaws of science fiction writing is they explain things too much. Scalzi explains things a perfect amount. If you're a fan of redlettermedia (and you should be) another thing to consider is the need for a \\"proto-ganist\\" who is new to a situation that asks questions and has the background explained to him. This is also implemented perfectly.<br />One thing I'd like to address is that he's compared to Heinlein, and at first I was annoyed at this as if people were inferring he was ripping him off or unoriginal. Now I can see the comparison, but only in the respect that Scalzi is a match for Heinlein in style and skill. I would love to see a movie of this as long as I could be assured they wouldn't mess it up as bad as Starship Troopers.
0312330871|5.0|Off the coast of Devon lies an island clouded in mystery. It carries the name of Indian Island because its form resembles an Indian. The silence surrounding the mansion is suddenly disturbed when eight guests arrive. Both Thomas and Ethel Rogers, the butler and the cook, are awaiting the guests. But they already have a problem. Their host hasn't arrived yet. And even stranger: there's a framed copy of the nursery rhyme \\"Ten Little Indians\\" hanging on the wall. They decide to go ahead with dinner in absence of their host. But when suddenly a gramophone record starts to play, it becomes clear that it is dangerous to trust anyone on this forsaken island.<br /><br />And Then There Were None is arguably one of the best works by Agatha Christie. Originally published in 1939, it still hasn't lost a single bit of its attractive power. The basic idea is as simple as it gets, but the denouement is simply a showcase of the inventiveness that is so characteristic of the English author. I have read this novel now for the third time and still I discover new aspects that show the ingenuity of the plot. Never will the reader feel unfairly treated, although it requires a very astute sleuth to predict the outcome at a first reading. The characters are quite stereotypical, but that cannot be avoided if you require that the reader keeps track of ten possible suspects and as such is easily forgiven.<br /><br />And Then There Were None is simply a must read for anyone with a liking for a good detective novel.

B00138J0KO|2.0|I must have listened to this album straight through at least five times and found only two decent songs: the title track and \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\".  In operatic terms, nearly every other song is recitativo accompagnato; or, as another review states, Roger talks his way through the album.  It's almost as if Waters is saying, \\"Melody?!  They've got my lyrics to listen to!\\"<br /><br />As album lyrics go, they are quite developed.  But compared to any other genre of writing (poetry, fiction, drama, even creative non-fiction), they are intellectually and emotionally stunted.  The defense that this album portrays a dream, with all of its incoherences portrayed as such, fails:  if artist is going to craft a work out of a dream, it has to be presented in a form that the audience will find compelling.  I found it very hard to care about the central character, as I do not care about his predicament.  Nightmares are what they are; this one doesn't move me.<br /><br />Waters made this album right after destroying what was left of Pink Floyd.  He ran out Richard Wright during the recording of \\"The Wall\\", ran out Nick Mason during \\"The Final Cut\\", and was about to do the same to David Gilmour when Gilmour walked out.  There's a reason \\"The Final Cut\\" is credited as \\"by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd\\".  Waters' ego was now of stratospheric proportions, and I think he believed he could so no wrong musically or lyrically.  This album is the result.  No one was there to correct his shortcomings -- no Gilmour or Bob Ezrin to make the music, well, more musical.  His songs barely allow Eric Clapton to shine, or any other musician for that matter.  Everyone is in the background except for Roger and Eric -- Eric gets the middle-ground and sometimes center stage.  Lyrically, Waters even attacks Yoko Ono for some reason.  Usually, he only attacks people who he believes has snubbed him -- granted, that's a lot of people, but what did Yoko do?  Or was Waters attempting to lay the basis for the claim that he was Lennon's successor?<br /><br />As I recall, Rolling Stone magazine gave it one star and called it \\"typical bilge Waters\\".  I'd say that is a far more accurate assessment than the three, four and five star reviews here.  I give it two stars despite its flaws, since \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\" is a powerful, if under-developed, song, for the melody to the title track (the lyrics are inconsequential), and for the happy ending.  TPACOH is the nadir of Waters' solo career; \\"Radio KAOS\\" is his creative summit (at least before \\"Ça Ira\\").

0802798225|3.0|I was looking forward to reading this book because a lot of people seem to think this is the best book Simone Elkeles has written. It's definitely the longest book she's written and the topic was interesting for me since I don't know much about gangs. Learning about the Latino Blood gang was actually my favorite part about this book because it broke a lot of my misconceptions about people involved in gangs. It made me look at them as being human. Some people on here who have given it negative reviews have done so because of the language and slang, but that part didn't bother me as much because I know how kids talk in high school. I mean, not everyone swears like a sailor but Simone Elkeles seems to understand what a lot of kids are like at this age and tries to keep it real. I think what ended up ruining the book for me was the romance between Alex and Brittany, the characterization of Britanny, and the pacing.     I've read a lot of Simone Elkeles's other books before so I already know her writing style and such. I also know her romances tend to focus more on appearances than anything else. Most chick lit books do but I find it pretty annoying after awhile and I felt Perfect Chemisty was the most superficial in this department. Alex is a sexy Latino and Brittany is a beautiful blond cheerleader... you just know from the start they're going to hook up at some point, and they do. It was like they were in heat, not in love.     As far as characterization, Brittany was my least favorite. She had an interesting story but I didn't make a connection with her part at all. I don't know why. I loved Alex's character, though. His character was funny and real at the same time. Other characters that shone were Alex's friend, Paco, and this Latino girl Brittany becomes friends with. The pacing of this book was kind of wacky. It was really long and I wasn't very involved in what was going on. It just felt dull, until the end with a drug deal.     I didn't hate this book but it wasn't my favorite. I loved the funny bits of this book, especially the Epilogue which was totally the author's style.
0756405890|5.0|I just finished reading this book. It's really wonderful. It's packed full of all the right elements, and done so with great style. In addition to a great story, there are wonderful nuggets of goodness tucked into every corner. Things that stick with you--beyond normal words.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have watched the older version multiple times and am so thrilled to have this new restored version.  It feels like the difference between watching something on VHS and Blue-Ray!  This one is a keeper!
B001C4AFOY|4.0|Young Victoria is a beautiful film.  I enjoy movies based upon history and especially those who recreate the atmosphere inherent in the events.<br /><br />Young Victoria relates the story about the daily life and challenges of Princess Victoria, who is designated as the heir to the English throne.  The challenges are real as there are powerful people who attempt to control her life, and even her personal choices.  The pressures she endures leads to both sympathy concerning the serious stresses  and admiration of her for enduring those pressures as she blossoms into a queen.<br /><br />The story itself may not be perfectly accurate as history.  The tale is, however realistic and compelling.  The events are well told and the actors are believable.  Emily Blunt is an excellent Victoria and Rupert Friend plays Albert very well.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie.  My biggest attraction is to the costumes and the sets.  This film paints a wonderful picture of the historical times and places.  First the costumes are beautiful, culturally accurate and historical.  This lavish settings enhance the atmosphere.  The rooms and halls where the action occurs are gorgeous.  The coronation ball is set in a huge room that is obviously one of the actual ballrooms used by the royalty.<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies set in actual locations with accurate costumes.

B002W6Z0UK|3.0|I think it is very wrong that this cd edits the b word! The editing messes up the amazing sound of the song and lyrics. I love Lady Gaga! I was about to return the cd because of the censorship! Then, I found out that all versions of the cd are this way. Please correct me if I am wrong. I can hear the song the way it should be heard on Youtube when I watch the music video. Why can't I hear it on my cd? Lady Gaga's fans pay money for these cd's! I love her. It bugs me that she is so unique and vocal about her beliefs and does a wild performance at the MTV Video Music Awards with fake blood coming out of her, and she looks like she hung herself at the end of the performance, but we can't hear the b word on The Fame Monster? Wow! I can go to Wal-Mart if I want to go listen to censored music. I don't know why her record company chose to do this. Peace, Colleen Schilperoort and Ashleigh Thompson
B001NLKT60|5.0|Second book in Stieg Larsson's trilogy. Must be read in order. Stunning story, great characters.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Is this nation so afraid of anything associated with a bit of intelligence? Sure thing, just dumb it way down! Don't they understand that people would even consider to watch LIFE are more like people with a bit brain? If it has to be associated with show business, why not use people with intelligence like Edward Norton or Judy Foster? No wonder our national test scores in science and math are in the bottom of list of the world. We can not even accept a good quality science DVD before ruining it. Oprah indeed! Which idiot's idea was it!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Final book in the trilogy. It's excellent. Wraps up the two previous books well. Wish Stieg were alive to give us more of these wonderful stories.
B000148KK2|4.0|Yes, I admit I was one of the so-called \\"Jazz Know-It-All's\\" when I first heard this CD and absolutely HATED it !  I got it at a very good price and and because of the \\"Temptation\\" single which was in heavy rotation on all the jazz radio stations at the time.      I HATED it at first b/c I was comparing this CD to all her previous releases:  \\"Look of Love\\" \\"All For You\\" \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\".  Those are all tried and true staples in Diana's repetoire.  This one obviously stuck out like a sore thumb.  Or so I thought.  After repeated listens, most of the songs GROW on you.  Many people have said they hate the DRUMS added on this CD, but people -- this is NOT a Jazz CD !!    Diana's vocals for the most part remains unchanged -- her smokey voice and comforting style are well in evidence.  Only the choice of songs is different, and it is a welcome change.  It's actually quite a moody CD and still perfect for a quiet night in front of the fire with your special someone.  I find it a perfect companion piece to Diana's more Jazz-oriented CD's.    Some have ripped into Diana Krall for caving in to husband Elvis's influence.  But I think the gal is trying to branch out from the stifling confines that her die-hard fans have made for her.  I applaud her courage and honesty as a musician.  It's called \\"GROWING\\" and I applaud Diana for taking that chance.  Her fans have pidgeon-holed her and her music into a small box and I feel Diana should branch out from time to time and experiment with different songs and styles.  What is music but a conglomeration of different styles?  Honestly, I think Diana is sick and tired of trying to be another \\"Julie London Clone\\".      It's unfortunate Diana did not release another similar CD after \\"Girl....Room\\".  As latest results show for her return to her jazz bread and butter, another CD of Bossa Nova songs on \\"Quiet Nights\\" have not given Diana the kudos and props from her fans like her previous jazz releases did.  Even music critics haveharped on Diana's old approach.  Perhaps her record company should let Diana make another \\"Girl.....Room\\" after somewhat disappointing sales of the \\"Quiet Nights\\" CD.  Hopefully there will be another \\"Girl In the Other Room\\" in her future.  I look forward to it.
0307454541|4.0|A little slow to begin, but keep reading.  A real page turner!  I've already got his second in the series and can't wait to get started.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I bought this show on blu-ray at the urging of a friend. I didn't have high expectations but after the first episode (Serenity Part 1 and 2) I was blown away. This show combines a western feel (and music) with sci-fi, drama, humor, sex appeal, and a unique originality that cements it as a very entertaining and enjoyable show. Every character has a story to tell along with the many ships, races, and planets. I urge everyone who is a fan to call, write, or e-mail creator/writer Joss Wheadon to bring this show back in some form on any network, perhaps the Sci-Fi Channel (would be a perfect home if Fox wouldn't take it back). If not a revival of the show, at least give the fans another movie! The fact that the movie Serenity was even made after the shows cancellation speaks volumes...how many shows do you know of were given a movie after only 11 aired episodes? At the time of writing this, Firefly has been in Amazon's top 100 bestsellers for over 215 days!! It's currently number 1 under Fox TV, sci-fi and fantasy TV, and sci-fi series too! Fox messed this show up when it originally aired by moving time slots, airing episodes out of order, and not giving it a good promotion...thus not even giving the show a real chance. May I remind you all that the show Family Guy was canceled by Fox but the fans who bought the DVDs loved it so much that they demanded its return and look what happened...it worked! The same can hold true for Firefly if we all make the extra effort to show our support. This is one of the best shows I've ever seen and it deserves a second chance. To quote the opening theme...\\"You can't take the skies from me.\\" BRING BACK FIREFLY PLEASE!
B003ELOQD4|4.0|I was at this show live back in October of 2009, and once I heard it was coming to DVD, I was excited. Even moreso once I heard it was going to be offered on Blu Ray. People are complaining about the picture, I am not sure what that is all about. The visuals are so stunning in blu it's very hard to describe. The audio is so pitch perfect that even with my outdated surround system, it felt like Bono and Co were in my living room.<br /><br />The dvd gives you the complete U2 experience and leaves nothing to chance. Stunning visual array, a video screen that has to be seen to be believed and a massive crowd of over 97,000 all singing \\"I Still Haven't Found (What I'm Looking For) is amazing.<br /><br />The extras are pretty cool, the time lapse of the stage being assembled, and a documentary on the creation of the stage and show was excellent. Like many others my only complaint is why \\"Breathe\\" was put as an \\"extra\\". Why could the creators just not present the set-list as it happened. That is very confusing to me. I would love to hear why that is the case.<br /><br />Great DVD, great Blu-Ray not just for U2 fans, but for people that like to watch concerts from the comfort of their own home. This one had tremendous re-watch value.<br /><br />LOVED IT!<br /><br />Mark
0385341008|5.0|One of those books you can't put down once you start. Lots of history and good story.
B001HN694K|4.0|OK, I had my doubts about this film.    I will STILL watch the 1951 Disney classic above  this one.    I had doubts when \\"Pocahontas\\" was released in 1995.  Turned out to be a great film.    This film is good NOT GREAT.  I have never read the Lewis Carroll book, just know the 1951 film.    Of course, we do NOT have songs in this 1.  You can always listen to the songs in the 1951 film.    Depp, he has done this type of role before, so this was no stretch for him.  Carter, Burton's girlfriend so that is how she keeps getting these parts in his film, good as the Red Queen.  The big head bit....with special effects the way the are today this effect should have been done better.  Hathaway needs Disney to get hit films.  OK job as the White Queen with no screen time till 2cd half of film.    Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum were a let down compared to the 1951 film.  All the animated characters NOT even close to the classic film.    The ending was bit of a let down.    NOW, I find myself having to say this with recent Disney DVD releases.  A line on the back of this DVD case describing the film \\"The extraordinary characters you've loved come to life richer and MORE COLORFUL THAN EVER\\".  OK, Disney, if you are prompting how the film looks then why are you guys resorting to PLAIN SILVER DVD' LIKE WHEN DVD'S CAME OUT IN THE LATE 1990'S?     No chapter search list or any information on film inside.    Disney has gone CHEAP & I just hate this.
B001EN71DG|5.0|So happy to see the original version of the trilogy, sans \\"Special Edition\\".  The picture looks great on my 32\\" HD TV.  If you're even thinking about buying this set of movies, do it!
B002C6A6N6|4.0|This is a great set and that it includes the two movies is very nice.  The price for the whole series and movies was also very affordable.  Shipping time was also  very fast.  I bought this set for my wife as this is her favorite series.  I would have otherwise given the product five stars except, as also noted by several other reviewers, there are pops and clicks on some of the discs during some of the episodes.  Most are not extremely noticeable, yet some are quite loud.  With the number of mentions from persons experiencing the same problem, I would have to recommend Amazon communicate with the manufacture concerning this problem.  While I have not sent my set back, I am considering it.  Amazon and the company or manufacturer should recall and replace the sets having this problem.  I notice some of the reviewers have sent sets back for exchange only to receive a replacement with the same problem.  This is not an acceptable solution.  I otherwise have enjoyed my transactions with Amazon and will continue to purchase through them but they need to follow up on this issue.  Thanks.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The greatest situation comedies are those that actually believe that their audiences just might be intelligent. Frazier was the most recent but the all time finest was the BBC's 'Yes, Minister'- which broke every rule that sitcoms were supposed to meet (come on, a few middle aged white guys just TALKING, Thats it? It would never work. Except that it did, brilliantly, and would have continued to do so were it not for the terminal illness of one of the principal actors).<br /><br />When Frazier ended I thought it would be a long time before we saw a smart, intelligent comedy again.  Then we get the Big Bang Theory- which is not only smart but also gives us moments of slapstick hilarity as well.  This is one of the best situation comedies ever. It is as simple as that.  This season ws not quite as good as the first two, but still I have laughed harder with this show tha with any other- maybe ever.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|If you are a fan of an action packed, suspenseful thriller with plot twists around every corner, you will absolutely LOVE Shutter Island!!  This is one of my top five movies ever! It will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to ending. This is the type of movie you will talk about for a long time. It is hard for a movie to truly impress me, but this one did. Amazing cast, equally impressive production, and the story line was terrific!!  I would recommend to anyone to watch the movie at least two times.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|I started watching this movie during dinner, a time when I usually don't watch the ending of many movies. I generally turn off the TV and dash back to my beloved computer. BUT Hanks grabbed me from the first scene of this powerful movie, holding me captive until the bittersweet ending. He's a fine actor and was superb in this role.<br /><br />Hanks plays the part of Chuck Noland, a FedEx systems engineer on company business when the plane crashes and he ends up alone on a deserted island. The photography and visuals are excellent when they follow Chuck's progress as he does everything humanly possible in order to survive. His physical and mental regression are heart-breaking to see, yet the film has its uplifting moments when he makes \\"friends\\" with a Wilson volleyball, using it as a \\"human\\" sounding board to keep his sanity. He names the ball \\"Wilson,\\" of course. The scenes when he talks to the volleyball look rather \\"insane,\\" but are the few touches of humor in the film.<br /><br />The scene where Chuck \\"loses\\" Wilson touched my heart; a very moving moment. By that time in the movie, Director Robert Zemeckis's wisdom in choosing stark island scenes to emphasize Chuck's solitude were remarkably evident.<br /><br />Just how does Chuck lose Wilson? How does he react? How is he finally rescued? How has his life changed when he gets back to the real world? How?...How?...How? And Is his girlfriend--played brilliantly by the fine actress Helen Hunt--still waiting for him after four years when everyone thought he was dead?<br /><br />You will learn the answers to those questions as you view this film that is brought vividly to life through Hank's realistic portrayal and the director's keen insight into this character. The sound effects and rhythmic camera moves capture Chuck's emerging survival skills to perfection.<br /><br />\\"Hope springs eternal in the human breast,\\" and after one episode when Chuck almost gives up, he never loses hope again, clinging to it despite the odds he's facing. His hope never seems to fail him until he returns home and faces his new reality in a very moving confrontation with the sweetheart he left behind. (Being a hopeless romantic, at that moment in the movie, I wanted this film to end the way I wanted it to...but that wasn't meant to be...)<br /><br />However, the film had a hopeful ending, one that left it up to the viewers to draw their own conclusions. I know what ending I chose, so I was not left with a feeling of wonderment, but with a strong feeling of hope and a fresh start for Chuck. Why not see this film and choose your own ending?<br /><br />Even though it was rather odd for one man to carry an entire movie, that's what happened in this one--and Hanks was up to the job! I agree with the New York Post review: Tom Hanks \\"...gives one of the towering screen performances of all time.\\" Five stars all the way to the bank...<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, June 3, 2010<br />Author of \\"Dream Reachers\\" (with Chase Von) and other booksodds he's facing.

B0000A118M|5.0|Absolutely outstanding, many words have been written about this man but he and Miles Davis stand alone as the giants of the original modern jazz era. What ever you want to call it, bebop, classic jazz or a new definitive sound that started to emerge during the 50's. It hit you smack in the face when the 1960's arrived. Yes a wonderful piece of work.

B000002VCE|5.0|This is a fantastic live concert cd, by the Late/Great Hughie Thomasson and his great band, the Outlaws. It even includes an \\"over the top\\" 20 minute version of \\"Green Grass & High Tides\\", and most of these songs are extended versions. The guitar playing on this cd is awesome. Like Lynyrd Skynyrd, you get 3 electric guitar players, and like the Allman Brohters, you get 2 drummers.    This is also, a historic album Cd of The Outlaws & Southern Rock. If you notice the dates of the recordings, you'll see the 1st recording was on 9/9/77. This was before the Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash of October 20, 1977, that killed the original lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, along with guitarist, Steve Gaines, and Steve's sister & backup singer Cassie Gaines, and long time road manager Dean Kilpatrick. The 3 other recordings were made after the Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash. This was during a sad time in Southern Rock. Hughie Thomasson the lead singer of the Outlaws and the Outlaws themselves, were very close friends, with the members of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Hughie later became a guitar player for Lynyrd Skynyrd, duting the mid 1990's, until around 2005. He later died around 2006. On, this cd he dedicates the long extended version of \\"Green Grass & High Tides\\" to Lynyrd Skynyrd.    The Outlays were from Tampa, Florida.    This was recorded 9/9/77 in Chicago, 11/1/77 in Los Angeles, 11/4/77 in San Diego, & 11/13/77 in Miami.    The line up:  Hughie Thomasson - lead vocals, electric guitar  Billy Jones - lead electric guitar, vocals  Monte Yoho - percussion, drums  Harvey Dalton Arnold - electric bass guitar, vocals  David Dix - percussion, drums  Freddie Salem - lead electric guitar, vocals    The songs:  1.Intro (relay breakdown)  2.Stick Around for Rock & Roll  3.Lover Boy  4.There Goes Another Love Song  5.Freeborn Man  6.Prisoner  7.I Hope You Don't Mind  8.Song for You  9.Cold and Lonesome  10.Holiday  11.Hurry Sundown  12.Green Grass and High Tides - The late/great Hughie Thomasson dedicates this one to Lynyrd Skynyrd.

I saw the David Attenborough narrated version on the discovery channel a month ago and loved it, however I thought Oprah would have potential to do a good narration job. Well, lookie lookie, she instead raped it. She reads the whole thing as if she's reading a kid's storybook. \\"Such creatures can NOT SURVIVE in this cold of temperatures!!!\\" Ugh. Gimme a break. Stay away from this at all costs and buy the DA version. I gave up after three episodes it's that bad. I think I'ma sell this on eBay and get the original version.

0061186473|4.0|Summary: A collection of short stories that are alternately fantastic, scary, and funny, written during various periods of Mr Gaiman's career.<br /><br />As this is a collection, I would only like to talk about my favorite stories although as I really enjoyed this I definitely recommend all.<br /><br />[In the order that I read them]<br /><br />1. \\"The Case of the Four and Twenty Blackbirds\\"-This is sort of a children's noir story with a hardboiled detective Jack Horner searching out the answer to \\"Who killed Humpty Dumpty?\\" It starts the book out on a high note.<br /><br />2. \\"How to Sell the Ponti Bridge\\"-funny story about swindling people set in another world<br /><br />3. \\"October in the Chair\\"-I liked the framing story which is of the twelve months gathering to tell stories as each month ends, but I didn't really like the story told by October which was unresolved to my mind.<br /><br />4. \\"The Witch's Headstone\\"-this is the story that became The Graveyard Book, which I really liked. I read it a while ago but I'm pretty sure this extract can be found in its entirety in the book. Unfortunately without the context of the book, I'm pretty sure this story would have left me baffled as it sets up many subplots but doesn't quite connect them.<br /><br />Overall: 4.5/5 so good!
030726999X|4.0|This novel continues with the travails of twenty-seven-year-old punky hacker Lisbeth Salander of the \\"Girl Who Played with Fire.\\" Involved in a violent, bloody scene at the end of that book, here, she has been admitted to a Swedish hospital with bullet wounds to her brain, shoulder, and hip. Although she has been egregiously victimized by a wide range of persons since childhood, nonetheless, the authorities are determined to unravel the complicated scene in order to press charges against her. The complexity of the entire situation is ratcheted up when a highly secretive \\"Section\\" of the SIS (the Swedish equivalent of the CIA) springs into action to reinterpret the crime scene, especially in regards to Zalachenko, who was slashed with an axe, but more importantly to them, was a Russian agent given Swedish asylum in 1976 and later fathered a daughter, namely, Lisbeth. The fact that a daughter would seek to kill a father opens up the possibilities of exposure of their operations unless any such investigation can be cutoff by declaring Lisbeth mentally unstable - exactly their intent and, in fact, a tactic used against her some fifteen years prior.<br /><br />Because this book is rather dependent on the previous one, the author is forced into lengthy explanations just to bring all up to speed. In addition, the reader must contend with numerous law enforcement and security agencies staffed by a myriad of officials, all with obscure Swedish names and located all over the Swedish map. Mikael Blomkvist, noted lead, rogue reporter of the hard-hitting monthly publication Millennium, takes a lead role in orchestrating Lisbeth's defense, even persuading his lawyer sister Annika Giannini to assume her case. Tension is increased when Blomkvist's long-time, married lover Erika Berger, editor of Millennium, takes a new job as editor-in-chief at a large daily, but immediately must contend with a clandestine stalker.<br /><br />Despite the backtracking and numerous names and agencies, the story moves along well with more and more revealed about the \\"Section\\" and their sordid past and desperate measures and the counter measures of Blomkvist, his newspaper co-workers, and various authorities. There is all manner of cloak and dagger: surveillance, following, bugging, computer hacking, etc - even Salander gets involved with the help of sympathetic doctor Anders Jonasson. As readers know from the first book in the trilogy, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" Lisbeth and Blomkvist had moved beyond friendship; however, with that relationship long since cooled and her being confined to a hospital, Blomkvist begins a torrid affair with fit, attractive investigator Monica Figuerola of the Constitution Protection unit, the main body investigating the \\"Section.\\" As readers of this series can attest, the author has a gift for capturing the feel and essence of his various scenes and characters.<br /><br />Reaction to this book could be mixed. Fans of Lisbeth Salander will be eagerly waiting to see if she can escape her latest ordeal; others may find the book to be tedious and confusing. The author bounces around the various departments without clearly delineating responsibilities for the issues at hand. The waif Lisbeth, with her street-smarts and survival instincts, is very appealing, but she does come across as well beyond realistic. She tends to be too smart and too powerful against formidable adversaries. Her becoming independently wealthy through her hacking strains credibility. Of course, the torments to which she has been subjected make her triumphs seem justifiable.<br /><br />The Lisbeth saga that began in the first book finally concludes. It is not quite as action-packed as the previous book, but the author's intent is different. That does not particularly lessen its appeal. Unfortunately, the premature death of the author will prevent us all from seeing if Lisbeth can regain a measure of normalcy and Blomkvist can achieve greater stasis in his life.<br /><br />PS. This review written despite the certainty that it will be buried in an avalanche of reviews.espite the certainty that it will be buried in an avalanche of reviews.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Needless to say, I love Gaga's music. The Fame Monster is a bit different from The Fame (supposedly it is darker, according to Gaga). However, it doesn't sound dark. The song subjects may be dark, but the songs themselves make you want to dance. If this is her idea of dark, then her darkness is my light. There is an \\"explicit\\" version is available on Amazon MP3 downloads if you don't want to hear the censored version. Personally, it's a lot better than hearing \\"bit\\" and \\"****ed\\" on some of her songs.

B001HN694K|5.0|Tim Burton will always be one of my favorite directors. While his library is not perfect, he is one of the greatest story tellers in film history. With worlds of the outlandish and incredible heartfilled characters there was no doubt that Disney would call upon him for bringing one of the most beloved childrens tales to life, in Alice In Wonderland.<br /><br />Now, in order to truly appreciate this film you need to know your Alice 101. If you have never read the two Alice books (yes not many people know there were two books) Or if you haven't seen the 1953 Disney animated film, chances are this will not be the best experience for you. What makes this film so great is that Tim Burton wanted to give his audience something fresh, so he made his very own unoffical 3rd Installment. This Alice In Wonderland is sort of what Stephen Speilberg's Hook did for Peter Pan. In Tim Burtons' fims whether good or bad his cast is always great (most of the time because it's the same). The best performances here have come from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Cater filling in the shoes and head of the Red Queen gives you a true 'you love to hate me' character. Johnny Depp turns on his Jack Sparrow/Willy Wonka charm, but kicks it up one huge knotch. The only beef I had with this movie I think the CGI was a tad overdone. Sure we have come to an age where the CGI is king. Still, you compare it to so many of the Burton films before, the lack of CGI just made them all the more whimsical. Still, the movie is entertaing and so much fun to watch. I would say proceed with caution if you haven't caught up on the story in a while. If you are an Alice fan, it will be a good one for you.
B002ZG9968|5.0|If you want a sweet, funny, life-affirming, very light, romantic movie escape this is it.  Not realistic, but that's a big part of the charm here. Jennifer Lopez is reliable as usual - engaging with a natural ease and likability. Got \\"hooked\\" on Alex O'Loughlin when I saw him in the wildly popular TV series \\"Moonlight\\" (2007-2008) that was unfortunately canceled after the writer's strike that year.  He looks like a big star on his way up - you can't keep your eyes off him when he's on screen.  It's not just that he is handsome but he's a good actor and even within the suspended reality of rom-com, believable as a sweet guy falling in love and doing the best he can. A great supporting cast as well all around - the BFF Mona is hilarious. Will definitely buy the DVD and watch again.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Yes, it's true what they are saying: the ending of Lost answers few questions, and even rises some new ones. But no, it's absolutely not true what some people are saying: that *the whole series* was a dream and *the Island* was Purgatory (those who think this got the end wrong). However, yes, it's true that in the end, the series decided to embrace spiritualism while in its whole run, it balanced science and faith with extreme caution.    If you expect explanations, you will hate the season. If you feel like you need to know the answer to every single mistery the series created (like, why was Walt special and why was Libby in a mental institution), you will hate the season. If you are agnostic, atheist, or downright hate everything that smells spiritual, you will hate the season. In short, if you are the Jack of season 1, you will hate the season.     If you think that no explanation whatsoever would be satisfying, and that part of the appeal of the show was how it made you theorize and think and wonder, you'll probably like the season. If you are aware that, yes, producers didn't had everything planned from the beginning and therefore some mysteries will be left unexplained (or given lame explanations), you'll forgive some of the season's flaws. But if you, like me, watched the series because of the characters and their stories and the way they interacted with each other, if you cared about these people, and you expected resolutions instead of explanations, you will probably love the season.     I, for one, absolutely loved it. It's probably not as good as seasons 1 or 5, but it's still amazing. And the ending was exciting, funny, emotional, well acted, subperbly directed, and it gave the whole story a satisfying conclusion that left almost (almost) no room for sequels or spin-offs or movies (which is a good thing).     The only thing left to say is, thanks, Lost. See you in another life.
030726839X|5.0|Unless I am mistaken, this book was released in some markets, the UK and Australia as \\"Finest Years, Churchill as Warlord 1940-45\\" back in 2009.    Buyer, beware.
0061120073|3.0|My aunt bought me this book a long time ago. Apparently it was one of her favorites growing up. I do not usually enjoy this type of book so I have put off reading it for at least 10 years. It was very hard to get through as I don't enjoy books with incessant descriptions. I thought the book was very dry until at least half way in. I was determined to finish it and it did get better although I am not sure I was satisfied with the ending. On the other hand, the book has a lot of historical significance and does an excellent job describing immigrant's lives in this period of time
0385341008|3.0|In some ways I am shocked that this has been on the best seller list for so long. I am baffled by the hype for this book. Either there are a lot of people who just read best sellers good or bad, or there are a lot of people who just don't read good books. This book was slow to get started, then switched gears during the second half of the book and had very little substance throughout. This was what I would call a fluff novel on a Sunday afternoon. If this had not been a book club selection for my book club, I would never have finsihed it. There was poor characterization, lack of historical facts, and disjointed story telling. Even with the epistolary style, I could have enjoyed it had there been a little more characterization and substance. I know I am in the minority here but certainly not alone. Our book club of 12 rated it an overall 3, though 2 members did not finish the book because they said they could not read one more letter, not one more word.
0142000655|5.0|I LOVED this book. I bought it and got about half way through but became very busy with school and had to put it down. I picked it back up and finished it a couple years later, when I had more time, but I am pretty sure I lost a lot in the time between. I can't wait to go back and read it again!
030745455X|5.0|Excellent book.  Loved his first book and looking forward to reading the third and last.
0060254920|5.0|I loved this book way before I was able to read it myself. My mom tells everyone the story of how I memorized the book before I knew how to read and used to sit and \\"read\\" the book to her. I still love the book and enjoy the unique illustrations.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|great movie! lots of imagination and creativity.  has a sad start but hang with it because it's a really funny movie.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I cannot believe that some rated this so low! For me, this was a thrill ride the entire time.  I couldn't wait to figure out why they were there or what would happen.  I read the kindle version and didn't notice any errors.  The most surprising part? This is just the first in a series! I can't wait until October when the next book is  released. I thought it was suspenseful, well written and I would reccommend it to everyone.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this whole trilogy! THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST did not disappoint. It simply finished the story and tied up loose ends.<br /><br />All three books were extremely well written and kept you reading way past bedtime!<br /><br />The first book, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO was a bit slow to get into because of the background information that Larsson put in that, arguably, could have been limited. Once you get past 5-6 chapters, it never stops.<br /><br />I'll miss all of the characters in this trilogy. They became my friends. Sad to see it end.
0793906091|5.0|The box it comes in, is really cool. Better than the 95' and 97' editions. The videos are also in a video holder thing, which i think is ok. But i do like the art work on both the box and video hholder. The video cases them selfs have some cool art work as well. This is a collection in my star wars collection. So I'd get it right away before they are gone!!

B002ZG98Z0|5.0|\\"Sex and the City 2\\" is not a great film, but a good film. If your a fan of the franchise and love Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda you will have a fondness for the movie. The fact that the producers have continued the series on the big screen shows they want to feed the apetite of \\"Sex and the City's\\" loyal fans who followed the series for six years on television and who went to the theatre in droves to see the first film. Unfortunately, critics and fans alike have stated this sequel is far inferior to the original. The problem really begins with the issue of not using beautiful New York City as the movie's backdrop. As everyone knows New York was as much a character in the series and the first film as the female leads, but in this outing the girls go to the Middle East, in Abu Dhabi, where Samantha takes the girls along when she goes there to do PR work. While there the bulk of the film takes place as the girls have a culture shock with the muslim world with the way they dress and the way the carry on.<br /> Another problem was with the cameo appearances of certain celebrities. Who cares if Miley Cyrus or Penelope Cruz are in the film for brief appearances? The film could have afforded even bigger stars to appear, with the kind of budget HBO set aside: $100,000,000. Liza Minnelli is fun to watch as the singer at Carrie's gay friend's wedding, Sanford, but I have to admit watching her do Beyonce's \\"Single Ladies\\" was like watching a train wreck on a collision course. It would have been more appropriate if Liza had done one of her own standards in this scene, but it was not to be.<br /> It was nice, however, to see Aiden back in the series as Carrie's long-lost boyfriend, but nothing much comes out of his appearance.<br /> The stories are pretty simple too: Carrie is dealing with marriage to Big; Samantha is going through menopause; Charlotte is having trouble with her kids; and Miranda deals with a sexist boss. Yes it was fun to see \\"my girls\\" again, but I wish the writers could have spent more time on the story instead of emphasizing the importance of glamour especially during this day in time of the recession.<br /> \\"Sex and the City 2\\", despite its downfall in its script, still performed very well at the boxoffice in its first weekend of release grossing over $82,000,000. This signifies that a third installment will most certain be on its way to theatres. Let's hope the writers do take into account what its loyal fans and critics are saying about this version and make the series even better the third time around!writers could have spent more time on the story instead of emphasizing the importance of glamour especially during this day in time of the recession.   \\"Sex and the City 2\\", despite its downfall in its script, still performed very well at the boxoffice in its first weekend of release grossing over $82,000,000.

B0033AGPG2|5.0|Ok, Ok. I'm currently and old fart who spent my teen years in the late 1960s. I always loved music and yes I still love all those bands from that era. I still have a turntable albeit I have more money invested in my phono preamp than I had in my entire system back in the day. In fact I suspect our house at that time dollar for dollar cost less than my current audio system. I never threw out or packed away my LPS when I made CDs my format of choice. So, let's recap: I'm old. I grew up on what is now called classic rock and roll. I still like music, classic R&R among the genres I still really like. I have a stereo system that kicks butt.<br /><br />Now, concerning Mr. Hendrix. I loved him from the moment my cheesy old Garrard turntable spun Are You Experienced for the first time. This was around late 1969. Yes, it was released a few years earlier, but I was still making the awkward transition from green plastic army men and model cars to girls and rock and roll. We didn't have a stereo at home, just an AM/FM/Short-wave radio. My tardiness in finding Jimi Hendrix's LP can be forgiven. Later that year, Mom was divorced and she and the Tribe of Seven relocated to a small city midway up Long Island. Being the oldest, young, strong, and suddenly largely without adult supervision I changed radically. I got thrown out of school and went to work, saving enough money to buy an all in one stereo system with the previously mentioned Garrard turntable. My first three LP purchases were Muddy Water's Electric Mud, Ultimate Spinach's Just Like Romeo and Juliet, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience's Are You Experienced. Hendrix's guitar spoke to my life! Soon after came Axis: Bold as Love and then Electric Ladyland. Next up was Smash Hits! and then came Band of Gypsies which I didn't understand. I gradually became aware that musicians had things to say. Hendrix was different.  He didn't need the put-on publicity stories like the Stones were accused of doing. He didn't need the indulgentstage volatility of the Who and Kinks. He didn't speak with the acerbic wit of John Lennon that few in the US understood at the time. It wasn't the ego-maniacal ravings of Ritchie Blackmore boasting of his guitar prowess. Yes, Hendrix was different. He didn't seem so much out to impress his audience as he was just being himself and pushing himself forward, out and away. The man was his music and the music was the man. If the rest of us wanted to follow along with him on his journey, there was always room for us. It was important to remember it was his trip and we were just passengers. He was the driver. We were the riders. Even though I was still largely a hormone driven, dopey kid at the time, I got what he was saying and was doing. But, like Jim Morrison, far too many people didn't \\"get\\" Hendrix and wanted to act like they owned him. They totally missed the musician, the mastery, the power, the man, and focused on the spectacle. Like crabs in a pail that pull the ones who try to escape back into the confines of their container, they were never willing to give him the freedom they claimed to represent. Hendrix became painfully aware that too many of his \\"fans\\" wanted to keep him burning guitars, playing with his teeth, and doing the other stage antics that were just the visual result of man, guitar, music, and the cosmos fusing together. The financial vampires that surrounded Hendrix knew those physical antics were what so many focused on. They knew that was where the money was, and with their blood sucking fangs deep in his cash flow, his escape with his art into the uncharted realms he wanted to explore was doubtful. After I \\"got\\" Hendrix, I finally \\"got\\" Band of Gypsies. And Jimi finally got away. After he was gone I remember when Cry of Love was released. Almost every track seemed to indicate he knew it was ending for him. Jimi's frustration showed (My Friend. Lyrics dealt directly with death and rebirth (Angel and especially Belly Button Window. To this day, Iam convinced he knew! Damn, I missed him and hated the thought of no more music from him. But, I also wasn't so selfish that I would begrudge him the peace he found in death that was kept from him in life.<br /><br />Sometime after his passing another album did come out. I'm not sure if it was this one, but it was a single LP and the cover was similar I think. There was a write up about it that said this was the new direction Hendrix was wanting to take with his music. As I remember the article, it claimed this was what he was doing to keep his sanity filling the personal need to push boundaries, but something his fans would not be ready for. I remember being disappointed in the record. I seem to recall it was largely instrumental as well. I wish I could remember for certain what it was. I can't find reference to it on the discographies I have searched. At the time I had little exposure to or knowledge of jazz, real blues, or anything beyond AM radio and stuff I'd pick up on the BBC. Honestly, I didn't understand what I was hearing. Over the next several years after discovering Underground Radio, traveling and meeting many new and different kinds of people, my world and everything in it expanded. Yes, Jimi, old friend. I finally was experienced. I became a huge fan of progressive rock and later, fusion jazz, jazz, and dozens of genres of music since.<br /><br />I can't say I knew what was up with the sudden spate of Hendrix music that was coming out other than much of it was terrible. If it had a decent sound quality, it was all just greatest hits type mixes. Tracks from other albums were repackaged in endless combinations and with different art work. There was little that was new. There was also a lot of live material coming out, but it was mostly bootleg audio quality. When video footage started being released, it was more of the same- most was crap. Bad sound and limited or poorly shot performances. I bought many of them hoping for something I hadn't seen or heard. Eventually, I gave up. (Currently I have seen this same phenomenon happening with Bob Marley)It was only later I learned of the battle for the rights to his catalog between Dark Forces of Exploitation and the Hendrix Family. I learned the Dark Ones were cashing in on Hendrix and cared for nothing but fleecing fans out of a few more dollars. Then it all made sense!<br /><br />I was absolutely delighted to learn that this title was released and was also available on LP format. And being released with the approval of the Hendrix Family was a huge plus! There are samples of the track here on Amazon so they can be listened to. I think everybody interested in rock music of any era is aware of Jimi Hendrix and knows what to expect from his music. Here you can listen to \\"traditional\\" Hendrix, but also hear him pushing forward, and out, and up, and taking his music to new places. I can say nothing that hasn't already been said about him and his music. I can talk about my passion for it and hope it adds weight to my words. I couldn't get this record on the turntable fast enough after it arrived. Jimi and I picked right back up where we had left off. It wasn't just that I finally had a system powerful enough feel the music pounding my body or speakers with the dynamic range to pick up every time his finger touched a string. It wasn't that I could approach near concert volume although all that helped! It was my old friend back again to play for me. The hair on my neck and arms stood up during some passages. During others, I was the wild young man back on Eastern Long Island again; as yet unaware of the Hendrix guitar solo like ride my life was going to take me on. And what a ride it was! Thank you Jimi, thank you Hendrix Family. Thank you for doing this, for sharing Jimi with us as he deserves to be heard. Hopefully we are older and wiser now and can understand him as guide and master. If you haven't been experienced, come on the trip with us- there's always room for one more!
B001VNB54A|5.0|As an owner of Band of Brothers, when I heard The Pacific was coming out, I was very excited.  Little did I know how much of an impact this series would leave with me.  It seems that with every war movie/series that comes out, the directors feel the need to up the ante on how graphic and gruesome they present the war.  I feel like they are probably getting closer and closer to the real thing.  I am in no way trying to say that watching it is getting closer to actually living it, but as a dramatic documentary of these events, this series is stunning.  The cinematography and sound editing are spectacular!  The acting is top-notch.  It's funny...it's actually hard to say how much I like or dislike this or that in a series like this, when the message is so hard hitting and heart wrenching.<br /><br />Unlike BoB, we just follow three marines through their stories.  Two of the stories are taken from their own books; the third, from biographical accounts.  After several episodes, I was left utterly speechless at what was presented to me.  Long after the credits had rolled and the DVR reached the end of its recording, I was still sitting on my couch in silence, unable to contemplate what I just watched.  This series has left an impact on me.  I've always had a great appreciation for our military men and women.  Even more so now.  I ended up reading the books the series is based on.  With minor differences, small dramatic license, and some necessary independent interpretation of events/people...the series is true to what Robert Leckie and Eugene Sledge experienced.  This truly honors those who sacrificed everything that was asked of them...even their very lives.  And I am grateful that my generation will have this series as a means of remembering them.
B0033AGPEE|5.0|Warning- Much of this is the same review I wrote for First Rays of the New Rising Sun. There are a few changes. But, what I hold true for that release is no less valid for this one.

B002VECM4A|5.0|I work with a lot of folks in the low income black community and I see a lot of truth in this film.  I'm not saying everyone in the 'hood is carrying their father's baby, but this is how a lot of the black community live and no one seems to talk about it.  Republicans can't, because if they do they're racist.  Obama sure isn't.  Odd, huh?
B0039SFKSW|5.0|I've been an Asia fan ever since hearing \\"Heat of the Moment\\" for the first time in the back of my father's AMC Eagle way back in 1982.  I've followed them through the various incarnations through the years with Geoff Downes the mainstay on keyboards, John Payne on vocals and various other musicians taking on the guitar and drums.   Even though I enjoyed those albums, it just wasn't the original four.  Flash forward to 2006 and they reunite! I saw them live that same year at a small venue in Boston and they were fantastic!  The tour was such a success they decided to continue on with a new studio album \\"Phoenix\\".  It wasn't a bad disc, but it wasn't their best.  Well, they just released their newest effort \\"Omega\\" and I can whole-heartedly say \\"THEY\\"RE BACK!\\"  This is perhaps their best release since the debut album back in '82.  Back is the progressive/pop/rock sound that took them to the top of the charts.  John Wetton's strong vocals, Steve Howe's fantastic guitar playing, Carl Palmer's excellent as always drumming and all encompassed by Downes unbelievable keyboards.  The album's music and lyrics are some of the band's best.  The opening track \\"Finger on the Trigger\\" is a great Asia song and from the first chords is almost immediately recognizable as the band's trademark sound.  Omega is supported by 11 other great songs.  So if you want to go \\"Back to the Future\\" go out and get this new disc.
B003CIG7AE|3.0|This CD is mislabeled-it should not be listed in the \\"Pop\\" genre.  Although the band has a complete sound, it is more of a folk tune sound than today's version of pop.  As soon as the music began it reminded me of the group \\"Peter, Paul, and Mary\\".  It has more emphasis on the band than \\"Peter, Paul, and Mary\\", but it has the same rich, acoustic guitar sounds, rich vocals, and lyrical styling.  The whole CD is full of these light, folky songs that invoke a light mood.  Overall, if you like only pop music, this is not the CD for you, but if you're looking for a new twist on classic folk music, you'd very much enjoy \\"Infinite Arms\\".
B001HN6940|4.0|3.7 stars<br /><br />This begins off so well and then after about 30 minutes gets boringer and boringer. I had such great hopes at the start and soon gave them up when I saw how badly the script had messed with Carroll's original vision. That story and its magic wordplay is what made AIW great, not just the characters.<br /><br />Making this Alice's second visit down the hole is pointless and ends up killing the momentum. Carter steals the show and is the film's highlight, Depp is merely there as the Hatter, and Mia is, sorry to say, a very unexciting Alice. Is that really the best casting they could do? She just isn't much fun to watch here; we need an Alice of great verve and zing! Carroll's Alice is much sassier and just a lot more interesting, all told.<br /><br />But it's hard not to like the wonderful colors and fine sets, though the CGI gets old after about an hour. Nonetheless, the many fine visions make up for some of the meandering plot, if not nearly enough.<br /><br />Dang it, Tim: why mess with perfection? You could have stuck to the first and best story and made a real classic, but instead you used an unappealing older girl who leaches the fun out of everything, and a story that can't begin to compare with the faultless whimsy of the original.<br /><br />Sigh. Better luck next remake.
0811869261|5.0|This is my daughters favorite book.  We go for weeks only reading this book every night.  There are so many things to see and find.  I looked here to see if this author has any other similiar books - sadly I didn't see any.  I hope more are on the way though!
B000R9OFLO|5.0|I am in the process of reading this book now. It is an excellent book.  It is written in a way that you don't want to put the book down.  Also the history content is wonderful.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in American Indian culture.
B003E48AYC|5.0|When I saw the previews for this movie I understood that<br />this would be a what happened to Alice after she grew up<br />storyline. I loved Tim Burton's take on this classic.<br />For me the movie was about finding yourself and<br />not always doing what others may expect of you.<br />I'm glad Alice regained her \\"Muchness\\" by the<br />end of the story. The visuals were stunning and<br />any movie Johnny Depp is in is totally worth<br />watching as he is a fantastic actor in my<br />humble opinion. I thought the whole cast<br />played well off each other for that matter.<br />I'm glad I bought the combo pack. For the<br />value it can't be beat. I look forward to<br />watching the movie again to catch anything<br />I might of missed the 1st time around.
B0035F0MTG|5.0|Yuja Wang is a remarkably gifted young Chinese pianist who combines awesome seemingly effortless technique  with artistic sensitivity of the highest order.  The Scarlatti sonata which I have heard many many times was just a revelation while the Stravinsky and Brahms just dazzled me for someone so young.  I greatly look forward to when  she tries her skills at Beethoven, Schumann, and Mozart.  It is on my List of Intentions to see her live some time  in the future.  I can't imagine what she will be like 10 years from now when she begins to mature.  I intend to still be around to find out.  The sound of the piano on the recording is beautifully natural.  This is a CD to have if you love great piano playing.

B001DWXUWY|5.0|I have enjoyed Gaslight for a while now, but this album really stepped up the true viability of this band in the Rock world. nothing has changed about the style of this band, that's not what I mean here, rather they have matured into a full fledged high quality rock band that is innovative and inspiring. I have been listening to this album for a while now and it seems that every time i decide on a favorite song or two, I get hit with the subtle passion or heavy riffs of another and have to change my picks. I cannot think of a song on this album that is not High-Quality, High Passion great listening.    I don't care who you are or what you listen to, Gaslight Anthem is worth buying, and there is not better album to introduce you to this band than The 59 Sound.     Check this one out, you wont regret it.

B0000DYKET|5.0|I purchased these sandals just before a week's vacation to Disney World.  A few years back I made the mistake of wearing sandals to Disney world, one day of walking and my feet were killing me.  I must say I was extremely pleased with the Keens.  I wore them every single day except for one...the day I wore my tennis shoes my toes were blistered from my socks rubbing.  The next day I switched back to the Keens and I again had very happy feet.  I highly recommend these shoes for anyone and I am not one to usually take the time to write up a long review of a product.  My 2 year old also has a pair of the keens and she loves to wear them.    I highly recommend this product, they are definitely worth the price.

0143116738|3.0|Ken Robinson is an excellent speaker and his video about schools killing creativity really struck a chord with me. It is both funny and insightful.  I also enjoyed a longer video discussion about his book The Element. After watching these two videos I was certain that I would also enjoy the book.    Unfortunately, the best parts of the book were covered, almost verbatim, in the video. As such, there really wasn't anything new in the book aside from more examples of how people had overcome real or potential hardships to achieve great works in their areas of passion and expertise, and some superficial discussion of psychological theory about groups, self-identity, learning, and creativity.    I suspect that many readers, like me, picked up this book because they were looking for help or guidance in discovering what their \\"Element\\" is. Unfortunately, they will get little help here.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is great for people who don't have a lot of time to workout like me. I decided to start working out more consistently because I am a stay home mom who is sadly gaining weight slowly. I'm aware Jillian Michaels being famous and all, but to be honest I bought so many expensive infomercial dvds that I decide to pass on hers when her dvds came out. However, some keys words caught my attention such as, the affordable price, 30 days, and 20 minute workouts. So I decided to try it. I didn't necessary lose weight, but my husband noticed that I looked toned after about 2 weeks. I didn't even do it everyday. Now, I add it to my exercise regimen to give it more variety.    Pros:  -Short effective workouts in short amount of time  -Jillian M. is encouraging and likable.    Cons:   -There's some jumping so you may want to wear shoes to protect yourself if you're working out on hard wood floors.    Now I add yoga to my exercise routine, I am planning to try her Yoga Meltdown dvd.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Watching these incredible Daria episodes has brought back some wonderful memories for me. I was in 8th grade when this show debuted on MTV in Spring '97. Daria is sarcastic, anti-social and 100% real - there is nothing fake about this clever high school gal. Daria was the perfect role model, she was smart, strangely beautiful, and insecure but had enought sass to back up her imperfections. Some of my favorite episodes include: Too Cute, Road Worrier, Pierce Me, Jake of Hearts, Jane's Addition, I Loathe a Parade, Fire!, My Night at Daria's, and Boxing Daria. Also included in this 8-disc set are the 2 Daria movies, Is It Fall Yet? and Is It College Yet? I love Daria, she puts a smile on my face even though she rarely smiles herself. I also love when Daria blushes when she is around her unrequited crush, Trent and her first love, Tom - so sweet because Daria is not the kind of girl who likes to wear her heart on her sleeve. Yes, the music is changed but that didn't stop me from enjoying these fabulous episodes. I highly recommend this childhood favorite, get your copy today!
B002SJIO4A|1.0|What a let down. This is one hour, fifty-two minutes and thirty-six seconds of my life that I have wasted. I will never get it back. I gave it one star because it won't let me give it zero.<br /><br />I love a good science fiction story, but this movie, much like a commercial grade Hoover vacuum, sucked A LOT. I really tried to pay attention. I really tried to give it a chance. I kept saying to myself, \\"This has to get better, it surely can't get any worse.\\" But it did.<br /><br />Now I know why if flopped in theaters. Now I know why Blockbuster has dozens of copies, always in stock, never checked out.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say is that I watched it free via Comcast's online movies on demand. No wonder it's a free one and not a pay per view.<br /><br />I need aspirin. I have a \\"holy cr@p, that made my top 3 worst movie ever made list\\" headache.<br /><br />Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Even free is over priced. You'd be better off going outside and staring directly into the sun until your eyes fried.<br /><br />At least that's my not-so-humble opinion.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|This is quite possibly the best nature documentary I have ever had the privelege to watch (and I have watched MANY.)  Blu ray discs like this are the reason I took the plunge and bought an HDTV and Blu Ray player in the first place.  The images and colors on the screen are truly astounding.  How the BBC NHU gets footage like this is beyond me, but trust me, your jaw will be dropping a lot as you watch this series.  It is not just about amazing images of wildlife and the struggle for survival though, it is also about telling a story, which with the wonderfully wise and knowledgable narration of Sir David Attenborough this series accomplishes in sparkling fashion.  I can not recommend this series enough, though it may not be suitable for young children as some of the images can be a little intense and graphic (a mostly eaten Chinstrap penguin corpse comes to mind.)  Highly recommended without any reservations!

B003EYVXT6|4.0|The premise of Splice is pretty simple. Two scientists looking for a cure to mankind's most horrid diseases, mix human DNA in their splicing of animal genes. Instead of killing their creation, they decide to raise it. Then the you know what hits the fan. It's basically a better version of the the film Species. I know one features a really hot alien from space and this creature is created in the lab, but it has that same sexy vibe. You can tell the director, Vincenzo Natali, who also directed the cult favorite, Cube, really tried to make the audience feel uncomfortable with a few really twisted scenes. I was expecting something a little more shocking after reading some reviews, but perhaps watching Spartacus: Blood and Sand has left little room for surprise, at least for me.<br /><br />The movie relies on three performances and they are all very good. Other than the fact I find Adrien Brody hard to look at, he and Sarah Polley play the roles so seriously, you can't help but believe every word they say. There are a few situations where they do typical dumb things, but the dialogue and acting were believable most of the time. The creature named Dren, which looks more human than animal and ages rapidly, is a fantastic design. The early stages of it's life are all done with CGI, which is the least convincing, but once it hits the teen years, Delphine Chan&eacute;ac, takes over and really breathes some life into the character. Dren has odd shaped hands, legs and feet, no hair, communicates by squeaking, sprouts wings at will, has a long tail with a sharp tip, and has eyes set as far apart as possible while still remaining on the front of her face. Oh, and her name is nerd spelled backwards.<br /><br />The gore is really kept to a minimum. I thought there would be a little more red being thrown around than what you would see in a PG-13 movie. I won't spoil it, but there is a very weird sex scene and even a quick scene of rape towards the end, that got this film an R rating, along with the language. There was more violence and gore in Drag Me to Hell. I also didn't like the last 15 minutes that much. It felt a little rushed and turned into nothing more than a typical creature feature.<br /><br />Splice is not a great horror film, but it's a pretty good one, that shouldn't be missed once it hits Blu-ray.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 starsage.

B003ELOQD4|1.0|Man, I couldn't have been more disappointed with this bluray.  Ok, I was at this concert  about 15 feet from the outer runway and no I couldn't find myself but that isn't why I am disappointed.  First off the quality is like a regular DVD this is not high definition by any means. Second, ENOUGH of the 3 second fast cuts in the filming!  When are these directors going to stop editing these concerts like an MTV video?  On a 60 inch TV it becomes nauseating and down  right annoying.  Hold the stinking camera in one place otherwise I would banish you to pergatory where you will be forced to watch \\"Speed Racer\\" for 12 hours a day!  The last was the weird way this thing was put togther with this Space ship at the begining.  It was SUCH and amazing show  and ruined by taking out the actual opening and some adding dated looking CGI space ship.  To me the whole DVD ( I can't call it a bluray) is a disaster.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|*** This review contains spoilers ***<br /><br />Right away 'District 9', with the giant alien mother ship hovering in the sky, reminded me of the earlier movie and TV series 'Alien Nation'. That TV Series actually was an improvement over the original movie as the characters had some wonderful idiosyncrasies and you could easily identify with them as they represented a new (and also familiar) ethnic group. Not so with District 9. The aliens look part insect, part crab and have an unintelligible language consisting mainly of clicks and other weird sounds (somehow the aliens can easily understand English but we viewers must watch subtitles; it's not very clear whether humans in the story can understand the 'prawns' very well--you never see any interpreters assisting any of the soldiers when they enter District 9 and attempt to evict the prawns). Even worse is the fact that the prawns are not a very likable bunch as they are scavengers and as we are informed from the outset, constantly committing crimes against the human population which leads for the call for them to be relocated.<br /><br />The first half hour of 'District 9' is devoted to what I would call a mockumentary (similar to the film 'Waiting for Guffman'). The film takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa and various people are interviewed providing the back story of the alien arrival and subsequent colonization on earth. The filmmakers were lucky to find an abandoned shantytown in Soweto where set designers ably created a massive junkyard inhabited by the prawns. During the mockumentary, it's established that some kind of command module floated down to earth from the mother ship but for some reason, after 20 years, it's never been located inside District 9. I would think that if an alien ship actually landed here on earth, there would have been a huge team of international investigators searching for that module and no doubt finding it after a short search.<br /><br />District 9 becomes more confusing when we're introduced to the protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe. He's a bureaucrat who also happens to be the son-in-law of the director at MNU (Multinational United), the corporate group of military contractors who have been awarded a contract to relocate the prawns to a cleaner district outside of Johannesburg. I could never understand why the company needs to have the prawns EACH sign an eviction notice before being relocated. The explanation is that it's a 'cover' but how could the company possibly have 1.8 million uncooperative creatures sign an agreement? If they kept the operation closed to the public, there would have been no need for those eviction notices. Wikus looks ridiculous traipsing around trying to collect signatures and he's such a buffoon of a character that one wonders if the filmmakers were actually going for comedy toward the beginning of their narrative. Certainly the prawns' ravenous desire for cat food adds to the comedy and a group of Nigerian criminals also get short shrift here too as they have no regrets about living inside the odious District 9 and scamming the prawns for alien weapons (which they don't know how to use) in exchange for cat food.<br /><br />The mockumentary is pretty much dispensed with as we break into the second act of the story. A prawn and his son have been working for years developing some kind of fuel to power the command module back to the mother ship. Wikus manages to ingest some of the black goo and much like the movie 'The Fly', he grows a prawn hand. The bad guys from MNU (they're all bad!) decide to cut Wikus up and sell his body parts to the highest bidder (there's some mumble jumble talk about how his 50-50 human/prawn DNA will sell very well on the black market). Wikus of course escapes and begs for help from the prawn and his son inside the underground module. The prawn can possibly help him in three years after returning to the mother ship but only if they can get the container containing the black goo from MNU headquarters which Wikus had confiscated when he first found it. Much like Terminator 2, Wikus and the prawn break into the impenetrable building and grab the container, only to be chased by MNU's top killer.<br /><br />Wikus is then captured by the Nigerians but manages to escape by fitting himself into a giant robotic fighting machine (shades of Transformers and Iron Man!). Our Bad guy killer from MNU manages to finally disable the robot and Wikus falls to the ground almost unconscious. Wikus however is saved when a bunch of prawns rip the MNU guy's head off (fortunately there are no close-ups). Oh yeah--the prawn and his son use the goo to power the module back to the mother ship. Everyone's thrilled when the ship leaves our atmosphere. Back to the mockumentary where we learn the prawns have been resettled.<br /><br />From a confused and awkward stab at comedy, District 9 tries to get real emotional when Wikus and the Prawn and his son BOND! Suddenly the prawns are actually sensitive creatures and Wikus is a hero for saving them! None of it works, since we haven't been invested in the unsavory Prawns from the beginning nor do we care about Wikus, despite all the pseudo-heroic machinations.<br /><br />If you watch the extras on the DVD, you'll learn that the script was patched together by the director and a co-writer on the fly and that the director really didn't have much of a clue as to what he was doing as he went along. I'll confess that the editing team saved this movie from being a complete disaster. Nonetheless, it's clear that the filmmakers tried to straddle between the worlds of both comedy and pathos and ended up with a hybrid of pure goofiness.onfiscated when he first found it.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Michael Patrick King, I liked your work on the series.  I liked (and defended) your work on the first Sex and the City movie.  But WHAT were you thinking here?<br /><br />How can you take \\"our\\" girls and think it will be funny to make them into the ultimate \\"ugly Americans\\" abroad?<br /><br />How can you be so insensitive to the fact that since the last movie many of us have been out of work for two years (or more) in the worst financial meltdown in our lifetimes, and yet we're supposed to relate to the ladies just carrying on as if nothing happened (other than an occasional reference here and there)?<br /><br />They aren't \\"us\\" anymore.  They're nothing like any of us anymore.  They're aliens in this film, and worse, they're insensitive, condescending, \\"ugly American\\" aliens.<br /><br />I ignored the bad reviews and went to the theater and watched the film twice to try to determine just why it bothered me so much the first time, and the thing is that I just can't relate to what these girls have become in the movies -- shallow, overly materialistic, WHINING, and NOTHING like anyone I know.  (And oh my God, Carrie, you finally have Mr. Big and EVERYTHING and a fabulous apartment and life and you're STILL WHINING.  What's wrong with you?  I can't relate to you anymore.)<br /><br />Beyond that, GIVE IT UP on the Pat Field alien fashions (Carrie looked AWFUL at Stanford's wedding), and who's doing the makeup on these girls?  This was finally Miranda's moment.  She came off looking great in this and being the only non-ugly American in the bunch.  The only thing I could fault her for in this is her choice of friends.<br /><br />This was so sad to see, and just left me thinking how much money does Michael Patrick King have by now that he so TOTALLY can't relate to real people anymore and thinks we want our faces shoved in the fact that we're suffering and our \\"old friends\\" aren't, and worse, they're so not suffering like us that they've become just plain self-absorbed and out of it.<br /><br />And I'm sorry, Mr. King, that you don't find the men in these women's lives interesting (at all) and treat them like nothing more than an accessory, but Carrie's finally, after all these years married to Mr. Big and we got to see, what, ten minutes of that (and it wasn't pretty, and neither was her nagging and emptiness).<br /><br />Truly awful movie experience.  I hope there are no more Sex and the City films after this.don't find the men in these women's lives interesting (at all) and treat them like nothing more than an accessory, but Carrie's finally, after all these years married to Mr. Big and we got to see, what, ten minutes of that (and it wasn't pretty, and neither was her nagging and emptiness).

0061438294|5.0|I picked up this book because I had heard through some friends that Mr. Navarro's work was highly regarded in many different circles and because I thought it would help my poker play. And while I haven't really had a chance to test some of these \\"tells\\" at the card table, I have been able to take more notice of people's body language at work and play, and I've become more conscious of my own body movements and its reflection of my thoughts and emotions at any given time. In fact, in a recent business meeting, I had the dubious pleasure of sending enough negative body language that one of our customers commented to me, \\"You're taking a bad attitude,\\" before I'd even said a word.  So, all I want to say, and all I think I need to say about this book is, the information is sound, accurate, universal and useful. It will make you better at deciphering people's emotions and thoughts in a given situation, but it may make you so conscious of your own body language, that if you can't control it and remember to send positive signals, you might just get yourself in trouble like I did.

0802130208|5.0|I suppose it is no coincidence that as I decide to read John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces that the horrendous Louisiana oil gush would erupt in the Gulf of Mexico.  Both are perfect indictments of the incompetence performed by those around us who would have us believe that they should be in charge and know what they are doing. Like the wreckage of the oil gush, this work by John Kennedy Toole is an ingenious novel that illustrates the incompetence and corruption that will ceaselessly flow when initiated from a broken valve.       Toole's work is a masterpiece of language and satire, centering, or perhaps orbiting around Ignatius J. Reilly, one of the more interestingly conceived characters I've ever read. A semi-educated giant of a slob in every sense imaginable and with no redeeming qualities, Ignatius waddles throughout the work, influencing typically for the worse anyone and everyone coming within his obese sphere of decay with his unfocused intellect. Unable to relate to anyone in New Orleans or society in general, Ignatius latently creates an intricate path of destruction in his avoidance of any type of employment while plotting social revolution on various fronts. That is, only after finding change for the movie theater. Ignatius is a contradiction of sloth and intellect, using his education to further his avoidance of reality. Whether forced to file the most menial of papers or selling hot dogs on the street, Ignatius would rather stage a worker revolt to have an afternoon off at the movies. Eerily similar in character to W.C. Fields, he is a bumbling spark that ignites the lesser incompetence and avarice all around him.       A Confederacy of Dunces is a work of slapstick in dialogue, where the patois of the New Orleans cops, office workers, exotic dancers, hot dog vendors and \\"vagrants\\" found throughout the city clashes with that of the \\"learned\\".  Where whispers of lurking perverts or \\"comuniss\\" can get one arrested, the novel is a commentary onirrelevant intellectualism versus the reality of class struggle in the American South. As hilarious as the work is, it is a brilliant yet skewering glimpse at the plight of the so-called educated in everyday life, where people manipulate others into obeisance, even if they themselves don't know to what end.

For a group that is supposedly on the cutting edge of multimedia, the video on this blu-ray looks like one of my old VHS tapes from the early 90's. Dark, grainy, and off-color. I should know because I attended this concert. Having seen clips of the upcoming Springsteen dvd which is in true HD, I plan on returning this in exchange for that as soon as possible. What a shame. Wait for 2 months when this appears in the bargain bin at Walgreens.

While faithful to Japanese culture, he created a film that would appeal to western audiences; rather than relying strictly on cultural references that would be obscure to outsiders, he knew that the younger generation would enjoy more of a western.  Yet the cultural references - to the Bushido code, to group solidarity, to feudalism - are all there and can be mined as gems by astute viewers.<br /><br />The premise of the story - that peasants would hire aristocratic samurai for protection - is absurd on its face, violating the strict sense of hierarchy and caste limits that underlay all order in the static Japanese society.  Nonetheless, the peasants go to a chaotic, dirty town, seeking a group that will defend them in return for a few square meals a day, because it is the right thing to do.  As luck would have it, after many humiliating refusals, they come upon a lone samurai, a ronin not sworn to a feudal lord, who is shaving his head to pose as a priest in order to rescue a hostage child.  His hair piece, an indicator of rank that is sacred, comes off to the astonishment of onlookers.  The peasants know they have found their man.  This is a wonderful example of the kind of subtlety that is in every second of this film, a window into what can be the inimitable elegance of Japanese society as its most idealized.  He recruits 5 other samurai and eventually accepts the Mifune character as the 7th, though they know he is not a true samurai.<br /><br />As it turns out, the Mifune character acts as a vital emotional bridge to the peasant village - he understands both worlds and can smooth over questions of honor, of fear, of misunderstandings.  While the samurai prepare the village, a dazzling array of characters emerge, each playing a distinct role in the drama and violence as it unfolds.  In a way, it is like entering the life as portrayed in a Rembrandt painting, the acting is that good.<br /><br />The version that I bought (in Britain) is not quite the same as the one offered here.  It lacks the extended commentaries and movie about the movie, which I'm sure would be worthwhile to those who want to understand the deepest cultural references in this fine film.  However, I find the price of the US version excessive - I paid the equivalent of $7 for mine, which has a brief commentary that recapitulates the film.  It is amazing what the price differences are between country versions!<br /><br />Recommended warmly as a multi-layered film experience that is second to none.quite the same as the one offered here.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I've never been a fan of dramas- my favorite television shows by far are comedies. So really, what first got me started into watching Breaking Bad was finding out the main character is none other than the goofy dad from Malcom in the Middle. I just couldn't picture him in a sinister role so i watched the show more out of curiosity as to how he can portray such a different role, rather than attention to the plot or characters or whatever. I was simply blown away not just by his own acting skills, but everyone else on the show. Now when i think of Bryan Cranston, i think of walter from Breaking Bad, rather than Hal from Malcom in the Middle. What i particularly like about this series is that the writers don't feel compelled to make the actors verbalize every little action or emotion the character is feeling, but rather allow the actors to, well, act. This allows for a much more natural flow to their interactions, or even how the characters behave when alone. Most of the characters are incredibly complex and far from one-dimensional.     I could go on and on about this series, but i urge you to just watch some episodes on AMC and you'll see how much truth these rave reviews have.

However, it didn't really have much of a 'flow'...by this I mean, each chapter seemed like an anecdote or short story unto itself, that had many of the same characters. And I certainly wouldn't classify this as a mystery (that is what the back cover had it categorized as)...there wasn't much in the way of thrilling or 'whodunnit' action! All in all, an okay read. Glad I read it, but I feel no compulsion to continue reading the rest of this series.

081297381X|1.0|Why do I give a book I call \\"Vastly Entertaining\\" only one star? Taleb likes to demonstrate his contempt for journalists by calling them mere entertainers. This is one of his best insights. I'm often reminded when I see the \\"body language\\" expert on Bill O'Reilly's show of Sybil The Soothsayer from the prophetic movie \\"Network\\". Taleb himself is an entertainer although he might dispute such a characterization. He likes to portray himself the one wise man in a sea of fools. He fashions himself a deep thinker who is cultured and sophisticated unlike the boring MBAs he has to deal with. He is \\"a legend in his own mind\\".<br /><br />In the first book \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" he argues that too much editing by book publishers spoils the author's unique style and cadence. The consequence of this opinion is that that book is very poorly written. The Black Swan is better written or better edited. It is much easier to follow. The first book had very few ideas and not many citations. It was personal. We learned a lot about Taleeb - not so much about randomness. The first book is personal. It reads like musings by a man who thought a lot about math and the way it is used in commerce. This second book is rather different. I reads like an issue of \\"Psychology Today\\". It is a compilation of research anecdotes from the literature. These stories are mostly entertaining. Taleeb the journalist.<br /><br />What I learned from Taleeb is that a good living can be made from being a pop guru. He admires Alfred Korzybski and Malcolm Gladwell both of whom wrote this kind of pseudo scientific bestseller that appeals to the reader's vanity. Gladwell you may remember is the genius who assures his readers that they could have been as rich as Gates or as influential as Mozart if they had just practiced more. Korzibski wrote that war, discord and mental illness were just bad grammar.<br /><br />The great joy of reading this book is to uncover for yourself all the errors. I will confine myself to three examples. Taleeb at one point illustrates some point or other by invoking the Maginot Line. He says the Line showed the stupidity of the French because the clever Germans just went around it. The French indeed made mistakes but the Maginot Line did exactly what it was supposed to do - make the Germans go around. The French never expected the fixed fortification to completely block the Germans - that would have been very stupid. The Line was supposed to channel the expected German tank led invasion to the west where they could oppose them on more favorable ground. The French tanks at the time were more numerous and advanced than the German. The Maginot Line worked as intended it was the French tank doctrine that failed. This is a shocking missunderstanding of history from someone who tells us on every page how much smarter he is than everyone else.<br /><br />The second example is all the puffery about the normal distribution. He thinks it's evil or at least a major source of man's suffering on this earth. He refers to it as another example of Platonism. Apparently the \\"ideal form\\" of the normal curve has seduced many into error. How silly. How Platonic.<br /><br />He claims that people who have never taken a course in statistics are better off for not having been mislead by the Gaussian distribution. Notice that this is an assertion about the external world but he makes no effort to demonstrate it empirically. Taleeb is an empiricist only to the extent that it allows him to disparage others. It never occurs to him to actually test any of his own assertions. I guess he doesn't watch \\"Mythbusters\\" on TV.<br /><br />All he really does is demonstrate that if you use the wrong math tool you get into trouble. What a revelation! The normal curve is found in frequency distributions. Taleeb mostly uses examples from times series analysis. If someone confuses these two very different analysis domains he will indeed usually be wrong. Taleeb knows all this very well. One wonders if he's being sincer or if he's just engaging in hyperbole to sell books.<br /><br />All his exhortations about learning statistics makes very little sense. Beginning stat students come to the first class armed with knowledge of how to multiply, add, subtract and divide. They all know about percentages even if they can't calculate them very well. The only real analytical tool they have is the ability to calculate an average. If they are attentive at the end of the class they will learn that the arithmetic mean is sometimes the wrong tool. They will learn that differences between two results may or may not be meaningful. They may learn correlation isn't causation. All these insights are useful but elementary. MBA students enter their first stat class not knowing much math and leave it knowing only a little bit more. That's the reality. Taleeb doesn't want to cure the ignorance he wants to exploit it. Exploitation of ignorance is fine with me as a trading strategy. But Taleeb no longer trades. He quit trading and went into the guru business.<br /><br />My final example is with his strategy for trading. He prides himself with his deep thinking. He lectures businesspeople about how much randomness and unpredictability there is in the market. At one point he tells us how his lecture attendees often ask him for his sophisticated trading strategy that he developed in the light of his understanding of randomness. He says with ill conceived contempt - they didn't really understand me if they asked such a question. Of course from the attendees viewpoint they want to know what is the payoff for enduring this blowhard's bloviation. When they find out that he has no formula and no worthwhile advice for making money they get mad.<br /><br />In the first book he tells a long story about how his neighbor across the street made much more money than he did but eventually lost everything in an unexpected market downturn. He hints at how his superior knowledge and appreciation of randomness saved him from a similar fate. In his second book - The Black Swan - he divulges his formula. He doesn't bet all his money every time. He keeps a lot of his working funds in treasury bonds. So he can lose all his \\"play\\" money and still pay his mortgage when a Black Swan event happens. Maybe I should have issued a spoiler alert. That's it. That's the punchline. Don't bet more than you can afford to lose.<br /><br />His neighbor seemed to bet all his funds every time. When his luck was rolling his way he got rich. When his luck turned bad he lost everything. Taleeb has no insight into how to see a Black Swan coming - he makes it clear that that is impossible. And his only advice is to not commit everything you have. He survived the Black Swan turn down because he never used all his funds. Limiting your risk exposure isn't bad advice but readers and lecture attendees expect a whole lot more.<br /><br />Taleeb believes that there is no way beat randomness except by refusing to be exposed to it. He lives his own advice. He played in the market long enough to benefit from good luck but quit before the bad luck had a chance to wipe him out. Now he writes books and gives lectures.

1439153663|5.0|Every so often a book just reaches out and grabs you. The Kitchen House by Kathleen Grissom was one of those books for me.<br /><br />It's 1791. Lavinia is 7 yrs old and her entire family has perished on the boat from Ireland to America. The captain takes her to his own plantation as an indentured servant. She is sent to live with the slaves who run the kitchen house. Abinia, as she comes to be known, is welcomed into the hearts and homes of Mama Mae, her daughter Belle (who is the captain's illegitimate daughter) and their extended families. They love her as one of their own, despite the fact that she is white.<br /><br />As Lavinia grows, she is taken to the big house to help with the captain's wife, who is battling an addiction to opium. It is here that Lavinia finally has to acknowledge the chasm between black and white, master and slave. And where her place is. As she grows older, circumstances conspire and she is forced to make difficult choices that have grievous repercussions. This is s a very bare bones synopsis as there is so much more to this book.<br /><br />Grissom forced me to break one of my cardinal rules. I never, ever, read ahead in a book. I got so caught up in the story, the characters and the hurtling plot that I was reading way too fast to take it all in. I had to find out what happened, then go back and slowly take the journey to the event.<br /><br />Grissom's descriptions of the settings, social life, characters and dialogue truly had them jumping off the page. Indeed, Grissom herself says that \\"For the most part, Lavinia and Belle dictated the story to me. From the beginning it became quite clear that if I tried to embellish or change their story, their narration would stop.\\" I became invested in each and every character, loving some and hating others, but each evoking emotion is this reader.<br /><br />The Kitchen House is told in alternating chapters from Lavinia and Belle's viewpoints The same event takes on very different hues when seen through another set of eyes.<br /><br />Slavery is a main theme of the book. But slavery in many different forms - addictions, societal expectations and mores as well as racial. But so is strength, again in many forms.<br /><br />I literally could not put The Kitchen House down. It's destined to be a keeper in my library.Slavery is a main theme of the book.

The characters are believable, the structure of the story line gripping. However, two thirds of the way through this long four hundred page mystery, the story bogs down and quickly deflates giving way to sentimentality, tedium, implausibility and a hastily contrived ending.

B003E48AYC|5.0|For this journey down the rabbit hole, Tim Burton is the driver and Johnny Depp the tour guide. Several film versions of Lewis Carroll's two \\"Alice\\" books have been released almost since the beginning of the 20th century. By and large, they have not been box office successes, though Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature has become perhaps the most iconic (I also like the 1933 Paramount film, the 1972 British musical film, the 1966 TV special of Through the Looking Glass, all on DVD, and the Hanna-Barbera 1966 special, which I wish was on DVD.)<br /><br />Disney's new big screen version of Tim Burton's vision of Alice in Wonderland, or \\"Underland,\\" gives us Johnny Depp once again creating an original persona to our sheer amazement, This film is the first mega-hit movie version of Alice ever, hitting the 1 billion dollar mark worldwide. It's a testament to Johnny Depp's astronomical star power within the right vehicle. It has also been accomplished not only through Burton's artistry, but Linda Woolverton's screenwriting (she penned Disney's Beauty and the Beast, after all).<br /><br />But they also had to change the story to make it work as a movie. Every filmmaker has struggled with the Carroll texts because, like dreams, they are random experiences with no arc. Walt Disney was the most successful, in my view, at staying faithful to the story without adding an arc (and Walt's artists' vision of the rabbit hole is still the best of all time).<br /><br />What was done with the 2010 Alice in Wonderland was to make it a revisit, of sorts, with Alice at marrying age and at a crossroads in life. This is her second Wonderland visit, to bring her confidence and direction. It's probably the most re-defined and altered story arc of any Alice adaptation to date (in the excellent Hallmark TV miniseries, Alice is afraid to recite a poem and the Wonderland characters give her moral support).<br /><br />Alice, in this version, is a bit like the Pevensie children in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe -- sent by a prophetic destiny to rid the kingdom of an oppressive, deadly leader. The characters are given names (which my son loves: \\"It's not the White Rabbit, Daddy, he's McTwisp!\\"). Elements of the Carroll narrative (the rabbit hole, \\"drink me,\\" etc.) are still here, but eventually the new adventure takes hold and the film becomes an action fantasy.<br /><br />By the time Alice, the Mad Hatter and the Dormouse reach the Queen's castle, they've become a team more in the style of L. Frank Baum than Carroll -- in fact, I expected Alice to tell the Hatter \\"I'm going to miss you most of all.\\" She even says a line similar to \\"and you were there, and you and you!\\" But I digress and perhaps spoil.<br /><br />But you know what? It works. And it's more akin to Disney tradition that it may seem at first, since Walt himself considered changing the Carroll story as well, and also almost made a live-action/animated version with Ginger Rogers. This film, with its blend of live actors, CG animation and motion capture, was virtually all performed in front of a green screen, a descendant of the live action/animated sequences in Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks.<br /><br />The cast is marvelous, on screen and off. Mia Wasikowska suggests Hayley Mills, with a physical resemblance as well as a similar spunky yet sober attitude. Helena Bonham Carter is having a ball with a juicy, outrageous villain to chew on Red Queen. Anne Hathaway channels Snow White (watch those bent elbows) and Billie Burke as the White Queen. The voices of Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Michael Sheen as the White Ra-- oops, I mean McTwisp are among the letter-perfect voice casting. And of course, there's to Johnny Depp's masterful, mercurial \\"Bozo-Blows-His-Big-Top,\\" yet somehow heartbreakingly sympathetic, Hatter.<br /><br />One note to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang fans: the legendary Barbara Windsor, who voices the swashbuckling Dormouse, was the blonde girl friend of Arthur Millard,the big goofball who got the ugly haircut from Dick Van Dyke's machine in the Sherman Brothers 1968 musical classic. And that's just a small part of a very big stage and screen career. It's nice to hear her in this film.<br /><br />The film is visually amazing and as good a reason as any to plunk down the cash for a Blu-Ray player. The DVD has a handful of the bonus features included on the Blu-Ray disc, but I sure would have loved to hear an audio commentary from someone about such an interesting film.<br /><br />Can't wait for the sequel -- how can there NOT be? I've always loved Alice in Wonderland and am glad to see it possibly become a franchise, as well as \\"cool\\" again. This is one instance where today's filmmakers have realized that total fantasy and escapism is what audiences want during depressed times.<br /><br />And it still compliments the Walt Disney version without replacing it.

A little slow to start (first three to five minutes) but then, when the love story begins, when it unfolds, and when it ends, you find yourself devoured into it. The ending was totally unexpected; a wonderful surprise. My husband and I watched it and we were both sobbing throughout the movie.     I normally read the book before seeing the movie, however, this movie was so wonderful, I'm purchasing the book.  I bought another movie for a friend as a gift.

1423113381|5.0|Rick Riordan's \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" pentalogy was one of the most successful of the wave of post-J. K. Rowling fantasy writers who arrived on the scene in the first decade of the 21st century.  Though heavily immersed in standard genre tropes (particularly those employed by Rowling), he managed a very fresh-feeling, innovative combination of classic Greek mythology and modern age teenage heroes.  Following the conclusion of that series (and a subpar film adaptation of the first book), Riordan returns to the fantasy adventure genre, with the mythology now being that of the Ancient Egyptians.  \\"The Red Pyramid\\", the first in a projected trilogy of books, finds Riordan in fine form, although I imagine some might find this format a bit repetitive if you have read his last series.  Some spoilers follow.    Our protagonists, Carter and Sadie, live somewhat unusual lives.  Carter trots the globe with his archaeologist father Julius, while his younger sister Sadie, lives in London with their mother's parents, who don't like Julius.  As a result, the two only see each other briefly each year.  Until a rather fateful encounter at the British Museum, which sends the two off on a globe-trotting adventure.  They are the descendants of the Pharaohs, and thus, of the Egyptian Gods themselves, and have formidable magical potential.  However, many in the magical community are deeply suspicious of anyone with ties to the gods, who are viewed as untrustworthy and dangerous; and the bloodyminded deity Set is on the move, preparing to bring about the end of the world.    Getting this out of the way, there's a very familiar feel to a lot of this.  Several plot points echo the \\"Harry Potter\\" series (the conflict between Carter/Sadie and the distrustful wizards is straight-up Harry vs. Cornelius Fudge), and more generally Riordan is using basically the same template he used in the \\"Percy Jackson\\" books, down to even some of the main plot devices (such as the characters constantly getting plot-relevant dreams, though I think that these books actually do a better job of integrating the dreams into the setup).  The ending and overall plot arc of the two series also, from this vantage, look rather similar, hinging on the planned return of the big bads of the respective mythologies.    That said, there's quite a lot to like here.  Fundamentally, Riordan is a good writer, and he does his research:  the use of Egyptian mythology is very detailed, and he makes plenty of inventive connections between Egypt and the modern world, much as he did with the Greeks.  I'm less familiar with Egyptian mythology than I was with Greek, but it's all very easy to follow (he even provides an explanation for many of the inconsistencies, such as the different relationships between Horus and Osiris/Isis).  It's also nice to see a major fantasy series headlined by black heroes (well, mixed-race, but still), as it has historically been a mainly white genre.  And there are plenty of well-handled plot twists.  This novel is noticeably a bit longer than Riordan's previous books, which tended to fall more into the 300-range, with this being 500.  He handles the extra space fairly well.    Recommended.

0740748475|4.0|I've been a Calvin and Hobbes fan since I was a kid. Upon finding this collection at a bookstore, I knew I had to have it. Listed at $150, though, I waited to purchase it until I had extra money. I looked it up on Amazon, and found that it was (significantly) cheaper here! Friggen' sweet! I ordered it right then, and opted for the two-day shipping. Sure enough, two days later, I came home to my package waiting for me.     The box seemed just a little large, but considering the weight of this collection (almost 25lbs), I figured it needed to be in order to ship it safely. I read a bunch of reviews saying that thier packages were barely taped together, the slipcase was dented/ripped/otherwise damaged, but mine arrived perfectly. The box was held together with a generous amount of that strong tape that has the stringy stuff in it, so the box was nowhere near falling apart or opening/tearing under the weight of the books in it. Inside the box the collection was surrounded by AIRplus (by STOROpack) protective air-filled plastic squares, and it was tightly packed to ensure there was no jostling around inside the box.     I was a little worried about the paper that was apparently glued to the top of the slipcase that had things like barcodes, prices, advertising notes, etc etc, but it was easily removed and didn't leave any glue/stickiness/paper shreds behind. The sides of the slipcase has pictures of Calvin and Hobbes, but they were printed on seperate pieces of paper and glued on. I thought this was particularly strange, because the books themselves have pictures on the sides as well but they were printed directly on the cover, which I much prefer because those ones won't get the corners turned up, or somehow get torn or ripped off.     The binding in these volumes isn't quite up to par, you'd think that for such a heavy book they'd have actually sewn the pages in, but they're just glued. I haven't had any pages fall out thus far, but I haven't had them for very long, either.    The first volume includes an introduction by Bill Watterson, as well as early strips of Calvin and Hobbes in which they're looks and personalities aren't quite developed into who they ended up being. It was fun to see how they first appeared in Bill's head, and then transform into the characters we all know and love.     In any case, despite the minor flaws, this collection is worth having. I'd have given it five stars had the binding been better, but I'm still glad I made the purchase.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Normally it doesn't bother me that much if I run into a spoiler or two before I see a movie, but I knew just enough about Moon to know I did not want this one spoiled for me! And oh, am I glad I stuck to that. While it's definitely possible to guess at some of the movie's secrets, it still makes a difference to have them revealed at the right time. And even if you guess at some of the twists, I think some of the ways in which the plot works itself out will still surprise you.<br /><br />Most of the movie revolves around Sam, who's manning a lonely station on the moon, and the calm computer that watches over him (Kevin Spacey, in some ways doing his best HAL impression, but managing to do quite a bit with the part). It's hard to imagine a movie that mostly consists of a guy in a room, but that's much of what we have here---and not only does it work, it's riveting! That's the brilliance and quality of both the acting and script.
0060558121|1.0|I'm going to queue up with the other one star reviewers.  The book is basically about people with little class who seem to have incredibly small bladders as they are always having to take a \\"piss\\".  One could make a drinking game with the number of times \\"piss\\" is used in the book.  Gaiman also lets no meal, no matter how trivial or unrelated to the plot, pass unmentioned.  Why is so much space taken up with the characters eating meal after meal while going from place to place?  Surely we can be allowed to assume the characters eat enough to stay alive and don't need to be reminded of it every few paragraphs.  Nope.  I kept waiting for the gods to become more awe inspiring or evil or wise or something.  Is it Gaiman's point that our gods can only be low class, shallow, foul-mouthed womanizers and whores since that reflects humanity as he sees it?  There was little to nothing clever about the book outside the premise.  American Gods still waits to be written.
B00138D2AS|3.0|Two things first: 1) I love Vangelis' music; and, 2) I bought this primarily for the \\"Cosmos\\" theme. This CD/MP3 has 2 tracks, but was originally released in 1975 with 9 tracks broken up over 2 parts: Part one had 4 tracks; part two, 3 tracks. The \\"Cosmos\\" theme [Movement 3\\" (from \\"Symphony to the Powers B\\")] was track 3, but here is about 13:00 minutes into track 1. And there is other good material on here, but primarily it seems to be an exercise in \\"progressive\\"/synthesizer music, and in 1975, that may be what it was intended to be; I don't know. I do know that from Vangelis' music since then, notably \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Chariots of Fire\\" and later, this album does not stand the test of time as well. There is some really great music on here; Jon Anderson's vocals on \\"So Long Ago, So Clear\\" was a wonderful surprise. But as this MP3 album contains two 22-minute tracks it's often difficult to differentiate between the original intended separate songs and the \\"amalgam\\" of these 2 parts; hence, one part of the track evokes a hellish chaotic theme and then switches to ethereal heavenly music, and the \\"hellish\\" parts seem to be the dominant theme, longer and more frequent. Again, perhaps it's a \\"buyer beware\\" on my part, but while the 4 minute \\"Cosmos\\" theme is a part of this album, it by no means represents the overall sound of the album. So if you're a Vangelis fan then you probably already have this album and are fine with it. Otherwise, \\"buyer beware\\" because two 30-second samples played here do not give a great picture of the entire 45+ minute run-time.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|I loved the book -this is why I got the movie but was not as impressed with the movie as the book
1401323820|4.0|If you're a fan of the TV series, \\"Castle,\\" you'll enjoy \\"Heat Wave\\" by the fictitious Richard Castle. The repartee between Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook is, as expected, very similar to what we enjoy between Beckett and Castle on the screen. Great literature? Not hardly, but a fun, breezy read for a warm summer afternoon.
B0000DYKET|5.0|I just acquired my second pair of Keen Newport H2's from an Amazon seller.    I have been extremely pleased with the first pair that I have had for over 2 years.  Wearing them as my primary shoes for that period and doing a lot of walking almost every day, I wore out a spot on the back of the sole, so I was ready for another pair.    The new one's however have suprised me a bit.  They feel about a half size or more smaller than the old pair.  My first thought was that they needed breaking in, but measurements reveal the soles to be at least 3/16's of an inch shorter and 1/8 inch narrower.  (I still have the box from the original purchase, so I know that both pair are mens 9.5.)     Now the comments that I have read lately that the shoes run small, and that they take too much effort to get on are beginning to make a good deal more sense than they had based on my first purchase.  My old pair was perfect, but the new one seems to have both of these shortcomings.     The shoes are still wonderful...but be careful what size you order.  Rather than just ordering a half size large, I'd recommend trying on a new pair before making a purchase.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|X Men Origins opened up the X-Men story by clarifying the beginning of Wolverine and how the government used mutants for their reasons. A good movie which sets the stage (after the credits) for another exhilarating X Men movie.
B0036EH3WU|1.0|This is absolute BS. I will never, never, never buy this. I, along with many others, have bought the first 5 seasons as soon as they were released. Now, exclusive to this complete set will be a bonus disc. It will also have a 15 minute epilogue that the regular release won't have. F'n BS. I urge all fans NOT to buy this and search for the content on the internet. I'm sure it won't take long to appear online. Is this how TRUE fans are rewarded?? Abrams can go to hell. So can ABC video. Thank God for downloads and bootlegs. And they wonder why fans buy bootlegs and use torrent sites. Typical greed. Please send these people a message and boycott this item.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I received the complete series today, and of course, tore into it like a kid at Christmas.  The warnings, both by the product and the reviewers here, that the original music used for the show was absent didn't even cross my mind once while I was watching it.  Honestly, I can't even remember what songs were suppose to be where... or what songs were used to begin with.  It's great to get a piece of my high school years back.  As horribly nostalagic as that sounds.  If you loved the series, and have a memory much like mine, then buy this for yourself and stop agonizing over it.
B003E8AF5U|2.0|What an incredible disappointment. After a stellar debut album, this band has clearly lost its way. Self-indulgent, meandering, with virtually indecipherable vocals and muddy production. I can appreciate experimentation and an attempt to explore new musical territory, but WOW. What a snoozefest.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firfly\\" only lasted one season, and I understand not all the episodes in this box set were even aired on tv, and that's a crying shame.  This was one of the best series in it's genre, with a novel concept, highly imaginative dialogue, and an outstanding ensemble cast.  If you watch this series be sure to watch the movie \\"Serenity\\" which makes an effort to tie up the series plot lines.

B001HN694K|2.0|Alas, this is the second film I've seen in recent weeks that is rich in visuals and impoverished in emotion and intellect; the other was Terry Gilliam's \\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\".<br /><br />The problem here is the characters -- not a single one, from the Cheshire Cat to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, has the slightest appeal, either in their design, personality, or dialog.  Even the voices of the CGI characters are poorly chosen here, as opposed to, say, the Shrek films, where the voices of Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Cameron Diaz, and Mike Myers are so perfectly suited to Donkey, Puss, Fiona, and Shrek.<br /><br />As a result, the viewer really doesn't care much what happens to Alice or her new-found companions in \\"Underland\\".<br /><br />A plot of sorts is grafted onto her adventure -- slay the dragon-like Jabberwocky -- and much is made of the way she finds the courage to face her fearsome foe and her real-life tormentors, but it is far from clear what really motivates her to do so.<br /><br />If you want to show off your new HDTV, you will likely be gratified by the spectacle armies of CGI technicians have served up here.  But if you like a movie with warmth, humor, and pathos, you will not want to peer into this particular looking glass.
B003ELOQD4|1.0|what a huge disappointment the moron director didn't include breathe, their best new track they have???  what is this guy thinking???

THAT IS HOW YOU SHOOT AND DIRECT A SHOW...  WHAT A MORON OF A DIRECTOR!!!!
B0018GRAE4|5.0|Anyone can learn to scream and sing and play loud music.  That seems to be the definition of today's metal scene.  But there are a few who can stand head and shoulders above the rest and deliver a solid, unforgettable message.  This is one of those bands; they have a solid, welcoming sound and a razor-sharp impact that won't leave you.  Grouped with bands such as Forgotten Fable, Luna Mortis, and Straight Line Stitch, these guys have created a piece of art with this album with a personality.
B0037SQ3C6|5.0|Yundi was most articulate and expressive in each of these Nocturnes as if he was trying to bring life to each of them by using suitable varying quickening and hesitations at various places and by his good control of volume. Yundi truly has his unique way of understanding as how Nocturnes should be played.     When some reviewers here mentioned that Yundi Li had played these Nocturnes in a seemingly similar way, I can hardly agree with them.  Their wrong impression could be due to the wrong perception as how Chopin's Nocturnes should be played. if you are used to Pires' overly dramatic playing of Chopin's Nocturnes, you may expect to hear the same excitement for each Nocturne from other pianists. Should Chopin's Nocturnes be normally played in this kind of overly excited way? I don't think so as each Nocturne is rich in sweet tuneful melodies which can best be brought out by playing them in the way they ought to be played, meaning they should be played melodically instead of trying to create too much dramatic effect unless there is a complete change of theme such as the stormy  parts of Op. 15 No. 1  and Op.48 No.1. Otherwise, within the same musical idea, it is just not natural that one should suddenly get excited and became too emotional by playing with a sudden big contrast in volume as what Pires had often done. One needs to build up the tension so as to reach the excitement in a more convincing way. This is what Yundi Li was good at, while playing those tuneful melodies elegantly, when necessary, he may build up the tension that will lead you to some excitements in a more convincing way instead of abruptly changing his emotion unexpectedly like Pires had often done. Although Pires had played these Nocturnes with tasteful rubato, she often spoiled her warm and beautiful playing with overly dramatic interpretation.    The recording sound of Yundi Li's Nocturnes is warmer as if they were produced in a concert hall.  Although there was no mention that Yundi Li's Nocturnes were not recorded in a recording studio, I am not surprised that they may have been done outside a studio because he had his previous recording \\"Liszt piano concerto No. 1\\" also not done in a studio in order to achieve the sound effect resembles to the warmer sound produced in a concert hall so that listeners may get the feeling of a live performance. Even though it is not possible to do digital splicing for recording done outside a recording studio, the other equally talented Chinese violinist Mengla Huang also had his CD recorded this way - both had preferred a warmer sound effect.     Some reviewers here had recommended Arrau and Nelson Freire. Arrau's rubato is good except that he had overdone it and as a result, he often interrupted his melody lines with too much dragging. A good piano teacher will not encourage his students to play with this kind of excessive rubato and exaggerated expression. Still, Arrau's playing is still enjoyable although his technique is rather weak. You may not want to place Nelson Freire in the same caliber as Rubinstein because of the way he felt about the music when he sometimes appeared to be  slightly erratic, hurried and changing mood unexpectedly.  Furthermore, Nelson Freire was not only  rather poor in tonal shadings, technically, he was also not in good command sometimes. For example, while he could not end his trills in time for Op.9 No.2, his fast running notes at some places especially Op.9 No.3 were also uneven with some notes almost inaudible. His Op.48 No.1 was plain and not expressive if you compare him with Rubinstein and Yundi. In the middle of the same piece, his left hand broken chords and his right hand chords were also poorly coordinated if you compare him with the same artists. His Op. 37 No.2 was straightforward with little rubato. Nelson Freire is not such an inspiring artist as Rubinstein and Yundi.     Among the Nocturnes played by Ivan Moravec,  Daniel Barenboim, Pires, Claudio Arrau, Nelson freire, Rubinstein and Yundi Li, those played by Rubinstein and Yundi Li are the most comfortable to listen to while Ivan Moravec's Nocturnes  are the least acceptable due to his unacceptable phrasing and rubato exemplified by his varying quickening and hesitations being badly done.    Rubinstein and Yundi Li often gave you the impression that with their extraordinary inborn ability to understand music language, they were able to totally immerse themselves into the music they were playing. Playing that came from their deep feelings were always soothing and will never sound hurried. But Rubinstein was often too dreamy and lingering over notes for far too long and as a result, some pieces had become fragmented with Op. 27 No.2 the most obvious - the serene melody of hypnotic beauty of this piece seemed to have been overlooked by Rubinstein. Nevertheless, you will love his dreamy way of playing  Op. 55 No.1 especially towards the end of this piece. Rubinstein could also be rather straightforward at many places with Op 48 No.2 the most obvious when he was almost straightforward throughout the whole piece with very little rubato. Yundi Li is more balanced with exquisitely tasteful rubato and  beautiful phrasing most suited for Chopin's Nocturnes besides being equipped with the best technique and richer tonal color. Op 48 No. 1 really caught my attention as it was strikingly well played by Yundi. While he began Op 48 No. 1 slowly and solemnly, for the stormy part of this piece, one is overcome by his prowess and strength in creating the stormy effect and by his superbly done rubato for the fast running octaves - this is where you are able to tell if a pianist is equipped with an adequate technique. You may like to pay attention to the interesting  rhythm Yundi was able to bring out from his right hand at  3'15\\"  for Op. 9 No.3.  I haven't heard this from  other pianists.     As Op 27 No 1 was very weirdly criticized by someone, I bring it out here to illustrate  the fact that Yundioften analyses and understands the structure of a piece very well before he brings it to the public. Op 27 No 1 is another very well played Nocturne by Yundi when he played the  first part  of this Nocturne faster so that the left hand accompaniment would  not become sectional and hence was   able  to serve  as a sea of waves to carry the dark and  sometimes tension filled right hand melody. Rubinstein was too slow and somber here and the music had become too fragmented for the first part of the Nocturne to be fully appreciated.  Yundi also understood that the first part of this Nocturne was supposed to be very soft as required because it described one's inner dark feeling, but when the music reached the more triumphant mood in the middle part,  he increased  the volume  gradually until it  reached its glorious maximum. Hence, there is a marked difference in volume between the first part of this Nocturne and the middle part the way he had played it. Maria Joao Pires had as usual, played the first part of this Nocturne sometimes too loud with too much contrast in volume, resulting in some inconsistency in trying to express the  somber mood of this part of the Nocturne. Again, technically, Yundi was in supreme command throughout the whole Nocturne.     While playing these Nocturnes with serenity and poetic sensitivity, when it came to the stormy parts of these Nocturnes, Yundi exploded with the most powerful playing in creating the dramatic effect required in Op 48 No.1 and some other Nocturnes. His playing should be closest to what Chopin had wanted his Nocturnes to be played.
0375714839|3.0|I thought this was a quality read with some very interesting insight on growing up in Iran during the late 70's and into the 80's. But it felt more like a collection of memories that happened to be retold in chronological order more than a true novel or complete story.<br /><br />The art work was nothing special. Just black and white drawings by an average artist.<br /><br />If you are looking for an over-arcing story with more firm continuity and a true climax, I would look else where. But if the day to day life of an Iranian girl is something that would interest you, its worth a read.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|a kinder, gentler BOH comes forth on their third effort: Infinite Arms.  and while i do miss the wall of sound present on Cease to Begin gems  like \\"LRC\\" and \\"Cigarettes & Wedding Bands\\", this stripped down version  serves the band well.  the only song that misses for me is \\"Blue Beard\\"  (a little too kind & gentle).  \\"Laredo\\" and \\"Neighbor\\" are already classics.  three distinctly different albums in, Band of Horses are building a Wilco-  like structure...
B001TM1X0O|5.0|This vendor was very slow in sending out the book I ordered. Maybe my expectations were high, but the delivery took a long time.  I loved this book.  Loaned it and it was never returned.  Have bought it for gifts to others.  It's great.
B000069HKH|5.0|While many artists tried to pour their feelings about September 11, 2001 into song, few made it work. Alan Jackson, Yes. Paul McCartney, No. Toby Keith, double plus no. But only Bruce Springsteen answered his muse with an entire album built around his interpretations of the moment. Like his other American Epics &#34;Born In The USA&#34; and &#34;Burn To Run,&#34; &#34;The Rising&#34; is an astonishing work.<br /><br />He looks for revenge (&#34;Into The Fire,&#34; &#34;Empty Sky&#34;), redemption (&#34;Further On Up The Road&#34;) and the return of hope at &#34;Mary's Place,&#34; where the E Street Band bursts into the anthemic rock they're beloved for. Yet unlike most performers who focused on the jingoistic aspects of the time, Springsteen, most controversially, looked into the souls of those who could perpetrate such a vile action and then wrote &#34;Paradise.&#34; Like his look at the everyday people he has always championed, &#34;Paradise&#34; hits a bulls-eye in a sad and chilling way. On these shores, Springsteen also profiles the confused hero as he tries to sort out his part in the the morning his &#34;life was forever changed in a misty cloud of pink vapor&#34; in &#34;Nothing Man.&#34;<br /><br />While the population of &#34;The Rising&#34; have been dealing with this incredible sadness, Springsteen still makes it all feel cathartic. The title song is almost a call to gospel as it struggles to overcome the deep wound (&#34;Let's Be Friends&#34; tries, but doesn't meet the challenge.) They all still struggle with the shock and pain, but Springsteen managed to try and look forward even as each song's narrator dealt with the empty beds, homes and &#34;the long black line of cars snaking through town.&#34; On &#34;The Rising,&#34; Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band found a way to look into that &#34;blood red circle on the cold dark ground&#34; and hope that there could still be a future.
B001HN694K|4.0|Really liked the movie, although I had hoped for a better ending, it would have been nice to see Alice meet someone in the modern world like the Mad Hatter. All Johnny Depp fans I believe will like this one, I did, Johnny brings to this role much of the antics you saw in the Pirates trilogy and I am looking forward to the 4th Pirates movie. Fan craze aside though, this is a really good movie about finding and accepting your destiny, as Alice finally does in the end. I would recommend it.
B000002H97|5.0|Everytime i hear this music it just makes me want to yell at the people that bothered me throught my years from High School you know who you are, This album is very loud just the way metal should be, I won't say names of the people because you know who you are, This album makes me forget about the people in the past just like Metallica says And Nothing Else Matters, I have found a special friend that loves me and That's all that matters to me.
B00275EHIM|4.0|I always enjoy a movie that has more grunting than dialog (take that as you will).<br /><br />Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time<br />Synopsis<br />The king of Persia adopts a boy from the streets as his son after an act of courage. Dastan grows up to be a fighter, however his brothers and uncle turn on him. He flees into the desert with a princess and a murderous horde attempting to steal the dagger he acquired in his last battle.<br /><br />Review<br />My disclaimer is that I have never played the Prince of Persia video games. Though I can always tell a video game sequence homage, and this movie certainly pays it's dues to the look and feel of the actual games. Disney managed to recapture some of the magic that they had created with the original Pirates of the Caribbean minus the overly annoying Keira Knightly. It also has the random accents found in so many Disney movies. Jake Gyllenhaal is good looking and easy to love, though lacking in any kind of deep thought. The plot moves quickly, and the visual effects are great. The fight sequences are a little choppy, but very reminiscent of game play. There are some very funny moments, such as a rant about taxes and ostrich races. Overall, I found the movie to be pretty entertaining, not revolutionary or anything, but fun.<br /><br />My Recommendation<br />Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a fun movie, worth seeing in the theater. I don't say that about many movies... :)
B00006RAKP|5.0|My father was dying of pancreatic cancer in April 2010.  He lived in a remote town in Minnesota and I lived in Virginia.  Because he was a very guarded and private man, I didn't know much about him or his interests.  During one of our last phone visits, I took a chance and asked him if he had a particular preference in music.  He said that his favorite artist was Elton John, but that he didn't have any of his recordings.  I jumped on Amazon.com and was thrilled to find this collection which had all his favorites, including \\"Daniel\\". Wanting to make one last effort to \\"connect\\", I had it shipped overnight as a surprise, hoping he'd get to listen to it before it was too late.  He called the next evening with a smile in his weak voice, saying it had arrived that afternoon and that he'd been listening to it nonstop.  To my knowledge, he was listening to it to the very end.  Thanks, Amazon.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Welcome to Metropolis, circa 3005, where you'll hear about an uber-powerful robot that's leading her fellow androids to follow love and discover freedom. That's the premise behind the whimsical drama that is Janelle Monáe's masterpiece debut album.    But if you're apprehensive about her outlandish thematic backdrop, she'll disarm your skepticism with her transfixing voice and chameleon-like ability to channel so many different vocal personas.    Lead single, \\"Tightrope\\" featuring Big Boi of OutKast, shows the Kansas City-native at her funkiest, as she works into a frenzy only James Brown could appreciate or duplicate. Ironically it's the only moment of its kind. The majority of the material is far more daring and memorable.    The first three songs of Suite II, the album's first half, come at you in tandem, fused into a dizzying DJ mix that's so infectious the songs' deeper meaning is easily missed on the first listen.     \\"Dance or Die\\" starts Monáe off as an emcee spitting urgent rhymes: I'm praying for the man sitting without much time/May he understand the clock will never rewind. Then there's a sprinkle of Motown on the breezy \\"Faster,\\" where she seems to catch her breath before launching into an all-out vocal assault on \\"Locked Inside.\\" Sampling elements of some of the biggest 80s R&B hits, \\"Locked Inside\\" instantly feels familiar but is refreshed so well by her unique church-bred vocal delivery.     Elsewhere, upbeat moments on \\"Cold War,\\" which genuinely infuses the British Rock of the late-60s, and \\"Come Alive\\" with its beautiful raw vocal and stripped instrumentation, harbor a completely different vein of intensity.    Those tracks could easily stand alone. It's the other half of ArchAndroid - the sweeping and intricately-placed overtures, and particularly the sprawling final two songs on Suite III (part two) that elevate Monae's work to near-epic.    \\"Say You'll Go\\" and \\"BaBopByeYa\\" both clock in at more than six minutes long, weaving through crescendos and stark moments of silence, while Monáe unveils the brilliant jazz guise of her voice.     But wait. She's singing about artificial life, right? Or is she?    \\"Oh, Maker\\" is a pure R&B slowjam wrapped in folk music where she sings: Oh maker, have you ever loved, or known just what is was? The maker she's referring to in the context of the album is surely the androids' \\"maker,\\" but does she really mean God?    Monáe purporting to be an android is but an allegory to the realities of the society. All of the android folly is juxtaposed to the world we live in. Metropolis in 3005 is a snapshot of the world today; the globe is brimming with war, children are being stripped of their innocence, people have lost their identities and world leaders their integrity.    So, if God is the \\"maker\\" then the place she sings about on \\"Wondaland\\" must be heaven. That's one way to explain why she sings to angels, and why the last line of the song is an echoing refrain: \\"Hallelujah, hallelujah...hallelujah.\\"    The fusion of so many genres are covered on this album - to include psychedelic - is simply Monáe and her classically trained team exercising their musical muscles. Even if the creativity goes over the top and proves pointless, as with the overwrought \\"Make the Bus\\" and underdeveloped \\"Neon Gumbo,\\" the overall effort is grand enough to mitigate their presence.    Much more than a collection of well-produced and precisely sung songs, The ArchAndroid is a musical soundtrack in search of an accompanying feature film. Interwoven meticulously and replete with showmanship, the album's main advantage may also be its biggest fault: its cosmic ambition.    There's a chance many people won't peel ArchAndroid to its purest layers and embrace Monáe's immense artistry. But at the very least they'll recognize that it's the most ambitious album since Lauryn Hill's 'Miseducation' and eagerly anticipate a sequel.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|AVATAR    I finally came across this film and finally felt the need to see it [I say finally like it was yesterday, it has been a while since I watched this, of course I watched this when it was released, anyway], I knew it had been overly hyped and had a feeling I would not like it. So when I finally decided to get it I can honestly say that while I did like it is far from the greatest film ever. Of course like any one will tell you visually it is a stunning film, you should have seen this in theaters. Of course on DVD and Blu Ray this film still looks amazing but the theatrical experience is where it was at. Still there are bad and good with this film although I really wanted this to be a 5 star classic. With that said this fails in my opinion to reach that legendary status as a whole, visually thought the film will of course go down in history.    I am sure you all know the story since I am very late to the party in reviewing this, but here it goes any way. The place is Pandora and Pandora is absolutely amazing, it is a very beautiful place with amazing creatures. One of the these so called creatures is the local human like inhabitants the Na'vi, a peaceful people who are one with there environment and planet. But the humans that are \\"visiting\\" the planet to study it are planning on running these people off so they can drill, of course they are not happy about that. In comes a paralyzed Marine named Jake Sully who is replacing his now deceased brother in a project that may help lower tensions between the two peoples. He is enlisted into the Avatar project in which he can control the body of a Na'vi like body in order to interact with them. But his military superior Colonel Quaritch and over all boss Parker Selfridge want him to gather Intel for their own purposes.    As the story would go he would meet and come to respect the native people and even fall in love with one of them, ala Pocahontas. And that is what I was thinking throughout this entire movie, not that it was a bad thing. I remember watching this with my bro and both us were thinking where have we seen this before, and then there it was, Pocahontas. Later in the film all we could think of was FernGully if you can believe that, once again not that this is a bad thing. The retelling of every story ever is basically what every movie is these days since original material is getting harder for some filmmakers to come with. I think the only reason that it was such a big deal with this film [people have said this film as stole from every story I can think of] is because it was such a huge film.    Now I may catch some heat for this but this film is not a classic in my opinion, visually yes but as far as everything else I don't think so. Which brings me to the visuals, this film is stunning and is wonderful to look at. From the animation cgi all the way to the vibrant colors all of the place. The land, creatures, and animals all look astonishing and on that level this film is great. James Cameron knows what he wants and did a great job with this film, sure to me the story could have been more original but honestly that is such a small thing because, well, the film was very entertaining. Cameron did a great job with this film but dare I say I liked his ex wife's film \\"The Hurt Locker\\" even more. Yes I said it, it is out there, let the hate come.    Now like I said the story is very familiar but lets get past that for a second and just take it for what it is, good. The story is the classic outsider getting in with the group and falling for one of the members. So with that said it is a nice tale of one people learning to respect the others cultures, yes I know it sounds like another very famous movie. With all that aside the performances are what you would expect from a big [huge] budget blockbuster film. All are good in this movie but none to most are not award worthy in my opinion which is normally the case with these type of films. Of course that may be because the visuals of this film were so strong it overshadowed everything else about the film. Sam Worthington is very good here in the lead as Jake Sully as is Giovanni Ribisi, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang [show stealer maybe], Joel Moore and the always great Michelle Rodriguez, all are good, some are voice acting.    Now the themes of the movie are many depending on who is watching the film and their take on it. The most prominent ones I have heard are people's belief in technology over faith and religion, this is the one I think is most likely. Of course there is also the human's destruction of the planet and the environment, I can see that in this film as well. And then there is the thing about this being a metaphor for America invading other countries during the war, this is the least likely in my opinion. What the case and I am sure Cameron has said what the theme truly is but let us once again move on.    Over all this is a very entertaining movie that cost a lot, and made a lot [even more thanks to the 3-D experience]. Is this a fun movie that people should just turn the brain off and enjoy, yes. Is this film a classic, in my opinion no, but I can see how some can make the case for it. The last thing I want to say or ask is this, am I wrong for rooting for the humans to crush the Na'vi and the traders to the human race [sorry Michelle]. My brother an I [who admittedly usually root for the so called \\"bad guys\\"] found our selves right in front of every one cheering when the Marines were blowing them away. In any movie of humans vs other I am a member of \\"team people\\" like Joe Rogan would say, I wanted the people to win. Well maybe not if the Na'vi represented religion over technology, then I have to go for them. Oh man I am confused, some one help me!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Everything you've heard about this movie is true.  It is beautiful.  The setting is dripping with colors and amazing effects.  Not only that, but the integration between the live action and the CGI is really something to see.  It is long.  And I mean this in a good way.  With so many movies clocking in at 90 minutes, its nice to really get some serious bang for your movie(or DVD) buck.  Nearly three hours of top-drawer story telling.  It is a bit preachy.  Evil technology is out to destroy the natural balance.  I'm no tree hugger, by any stretch of the imagination.  That said, you'll be cheering for the indigenous Na'vi, much in the same way that we rooted for the Ewoks back in the day.  This battle is certainly on a much grander scheme.    Adventure, romance, and humor.  The cast is diverse with heroes and villains each playing their part to move the story along.  The movie looks great and sounds amazing.  In case there was any doubt whatsoever, James Cameron has another hit on his hands.

0553062182|5.0|Don't listen to those who say this book offers no practical advice or help. It does. It also may strike a chord with you if you ever wondered why you were so bothered by noisy environments or loud people or any number of things that don't bother most people. Even those who want to claim your sensitivity is a RESULT of trauma, might consider that your sensitivity is what made something so traumatic for you in the first place! We are not all made the same. We do not all have the same strengths or weaknesses. Some are 'born leaders'and some are not, and THAT IS OKAY. Not everyone needs to be driven, aggressive, etc. As you will see if you read this book, which I recommend you do if you are sensitive to any degree.    ALSO, this book is not meant for people with PTSD. It is for HIGHLY SENSITIVE PEOPLE. To imply that one is highly sensitive only because they were exposed to some trauma early in life is ludicrous. People have different personalities, some of us being more sensitive. That's the point of the book. It helps me understand why I hate noisy bars, for example. That doesn't mean I have a panic attack when I find myself in one. It just means I don't like them because there is just too much stimuli in that situation. Hardly the same thing as PTSD. PTSD sufferers certainly need more than this book offers, which would be professional help, but the author didn't write it for them.

B002VECM6S|5.0|John Lee Hancock's excellent film tells the story of the formative years of Michael Oher, American football star player (left tackle) with the Baltimore Ravens, born on the wrong side of the tracks with a good heart but dealt a poor deal in life with no role model until he meets and is first helped by and later adopted by the (rich, white) Tuohy family in Memphis TN. It has good, pacy story development, first class editing and career-best performance form Sandra Bullock.<br /><br />The source material is Mike Lewis's 2006 book \\"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game\\". As is the way with screenplays, some minor liberties may have been taken with the true narrative of Michael's life with the Tuohys in order to serve the needs of a coherent drama. But the essential story is true-to-life and very well realised.<br /><br />Quinton Aaron puts in a fine performance as Big Mike (few actors would have the necessary size and physique for the role), and although all the leading characters are good, it's Bullock's performance as ballsy, compassionate Leigh-Anne Tuohy who drives the plot along and is its principal pro-active agency. The Oscar and Golden Globe awards for her performance were well deserved.<br /><br />A minor quirky detail is that musician Phil Collins' daughter Lily plays Sean and Leigh-Anne's teenage daughter in the film. Her real-life name? \\"Collins.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Blind Side\\" is not a \\"sports movie\\" but a film about building trust, how unlikely relationships are possible and can be very successful, and how generosity of heart and persistent commitment to someone else's success can achieve great things. The film is \\"feel-good\\" but in no way sentimental or schmaltzy. Its narrative drive is strong, the script sharp and clich&eacute;-free and you genuinely care about these people. It contains moments of memorable poignancy.<br /><br />It's hard to see how such a mediocre offering as \\"The Hurt Locker\\" could be awarded Best Film of 2009 by the Academy with clearly superior competition like this - but with the Academy, life is often full of surprises.<br /><br />See it, if you haven't already.Academy, life is often full of surprises.

0767812166|1.0|John Carpenter is known for only filming in anamorphic widescreen (except for his rare TV work). He's a master of the 16:9 ratio and the scale plays a big part in his movies. Why this is in fullscreen is anyone's guess. And why it doesn't have the director's commentary--that's already available in Europe--is just weird. This is an odd movie for Carpenter but he pulled it off well...it's worth a serious look but it's also worth waiting for a release that retains widescreen so you can see ALL the movie and that contains the usually very informative commentary.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|we're all critics.......i am not a ww2 vet  i have a deep appreciation and respect for all the soldiers who have served, both alive and gone; thank you for your sacrifice and our freedom, God bless you all!    imho: i must say that overall i enjoyed bob more than the pacific, but this was a good show indeed.  good acting and production values. all-in-all, a nice companion piece to bob.    however, i do agree that there is a tendency in the pacific to show mostly marines who were on the breaking point; i mean where are the dick winters of the pacific, where are the Lt. Spears??  i realize that some other opinions will point out that this was based on the 3 marines; i get that.   i'm just saying that bob had a more balanced picture, where we saw those that were on the breaking point (Lt. Dike, Lt. Compton) and those that would lead by example (Capt. Winter & Lt. Spears),   and a bunch of others in between.  but in the pacific, it seems most of the troops were like Dike. i know there were many more like Basilone, but the show did not give them equal time.  instead the makers of the show found it more important to give us a heavy dose of the crazy \\"snafu\\".  i think if there was a \\"snafu\\" in bob, they would have given him a nice little blanket party a long time ago. i know i would have. i don't know how Sledgehammer put up with that jerk.   and i say these words because of the way it was portrayed on this show. i suspect in real life it may have been a bit differently. Sledge must have seen some redeeming qualities in that weirdo.  if most veterans can vouch that most marines were on the breaking point, as hanks and spielberg seem to indicate, then i stand corrected. but i doubt it to be so.    i shouldn't be surprised most marines in this show were portrayed the way they were; look at who made this show.  remember that bob was made in 2001, pre-Iraq and pre-BDS (Bush derangement syndrome)    for me, the best part of the pacific was John Basilone. i did not know anythingabout this genuine american hero.   i wept when Lena goes back to his parents house.  (BTW, why did they not show JB being killed by a mortar round, like it really happened, instead of the \\"dramatic\\" 2 shots to the chest?  all accounts i have read up on say that it was a mortar blast.)    praise God for men like John Basilone  and God bless the USA!!!
0061914177|5.0|When I first saw Gary speak I though, wow, this guy's personality is a bit over the top. However, I quickly changed my mind after watching more of his videos and listing to Crush It! 2x on audible. Gary's dynamic personality and passion for what he does comes out consistently in every presentation he makes - which is why I found the audible version of Crush It! more powerful than the print copy.  His story is compelling enough to make you want to work that much harder at doing something you love.    Crush It! has a great blend of story and how to. Giving entrepreneurs the guidance and encouragement to move forward with a business - especially in a small niche market.  The long-tail theory is totally relevant and we certainly have proven their is room small niche players on the world wide web.     Thanks for the inspiring words Gary!

B003CIG7AE|2.0|I have to admit I wasn't familiar with Band of Horses but had several friends recommend them to me.  From what I heard I was interested in learning more, and found their CD on the Vine program.  Like several others who have reviewed this album, I've listened to this CD, trying to let the music and the approach \\"grow on me\\" but frankly, it's lost on me.  This album sounds like a band who didn't want to anger anyone, change anyone or influence anyone.  If it were possible, I'd link to another reviewer - M. Fulkerson - who titled his review \\"A step back for Band of Horses\\".  He, or she, mirrored my thinking about this album exactly when the reviewer said:<br /><br />\\"even on these two tracks I got a feeling that the band were just going along with the motions of being the Band Of Horses, as if they were a brand that now needed to be summarily sold to the music loving public. The guitar solos were by the numbers, seemingly devoid of any emotion or dynamism, just sort of pushing along until the bridge comes.<br />Unfortunately, the rest of the album sounds like it was made on auto-pilot. It's a very lazy sounding album, reminding me of something you might throw on the turntable while having a summer barbeque in your backyard: completely non-offensive and translucent to your guests. The album just barely chugs along, one song bleeding into the next, not really willing to jump and grab you with any melody or vocal hook.<br />\\"Infinite Arms\\" is missing the soul that we have come to love from Band Of Horses. It just doesn't sound like the band is trying at all.\\"<br /><br />I've never felt so in line with another review, so rather than try to say what Fulkerson said in a different way, I'll simply acknowledge that he or she nailed it.<br /><br />This CD sounds like what I imagine Neil Young sounds like when he is bored and lonely and heavily medicated on anxiety-reducing medication.  Perhaps the band meant to create an album that embraces everyone and has no specific focus or message, that simply bleeds into itself, track after track.  It's clear from the production, the writing and the singing that there is more talent and more \\"soul' there than is displayed - or perhaps I just don't get it.nto itself, track after track.

I loved how he took it back to where it all started for him - his innate love of starting/creating businesses. It was clear that passion, challenge, and purpose were his drivers.      While some will say business is business and personal is personal, Tony's story shows a totally different option, creating a family culture that blurs business and personal into a passionate mission to make a difference in the world - enjoying the journey through all it's ups and downs.

031606792X|1.0|Don't waste your time with this hideous book.  I thought the first three Twilight books were magical, I loved them.  This book ruined it!  I read the entire book because I was hoping it would get better, or maybe have a good ending.  The ending, although happy, is disappointing.    Some reviewers are saying they were gasping throughout the book because of its twists.  I gasped too, but because it was so outrageously bad.  There is a lot of supernatural things with vampires and the other books got a little out there with the werewolves, but this book was over the top.    Here is the basic summary of this book: miserable honeymoon, Edward has a guilt complex, Bella is pregnant with a half-vampire child that is consuming her from the inside out, but Bella wants to keep the child.  Bella ends up having the baby, then to save her life from the horrific pregnancy, Edward transforms her into a vampire.  Jacob falls in love, or imprints, with the baby.  The Volturi are suspicious of demon baby and receive misinformation about her, so they prepare to engage in a war with the Cullens.  The Cullens gather enough vampires to attest that the baby is no threat to the existence of vampires, the war is called off, as easy as that.  Also, Jacob is not a werewolf.  He is a \\"shape-shifter\\".  Now, it took a LOT of pages to tell this crappy story.    The pregnancy part lasts forever!!!  It was unbearably long, tedious, and boring.  It was all about Jacob worrying about Bella, and Bella nearly getting killed from the demon baby.  Edward was very removed from all of this.    Oh, and Charlie was okay with all of this.  No problems.  He sees Bella, who is a vampire, and her demon baby and Jacob, and acts like it is all normal, and that it isn't really his business anyway.    On top of the stupid plot, the writing was horrendous.  I enjoyed Stephenie Meyer's writing in the first three books, but way this book read was tacky and lazy.  There was no magic in it, no romance like the last threebooks.  I was never hanging on the edge in this; I was laughing at how bad it was.    Whatever happened to the whirlwind of emotions from the first three books?  I was so caught up in the first three books and was enveloped in them.  It took me just a few days to read each book.  This book took me months.    I wanted to like this book, and I love happy endings.  However, this happy ending let me down.  There was no rush of emotions, no romance like I felt in the first three books.  There is no magic in this book.  It is one of the worst books I have ever read!  And I really wanted to like this book!!
B000ELJBAA|5.0|David Gilmour's self-titled solo debut had the Pink Floyd sound all over it. However, parts of it felt more like the odd scraps of a committed band member than an album proper.<br /><br />\\"About Face\\", on the other hand, is more well-rounded.  This isn't, perhaps, a \\"lost Pink Floyd album\\" but it's fantastic nonetheless.<br /><br />There are some great tracks on here:  \\"Murder\\"--a reaction to John Lennon's death--is the standout, but \\"Until We Sleep\\", \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" and \\"You Know I'm Right\\" are all great tracks featuring the guitar and voice we all know and love.<br /><br />Meanwhile, every other track is enjoyable in its own right, with co-producer Bob Ezrin contributing some great orchestral arrangements.  Ezrin is known for his work with Alice Cooper, Peter Gabriel, Lou Reed, etc., as well as his work on \\"The Wall\\".  His touches are unmistakable and a real pleasure, once you know what to listen for.<br /><br />Does this have the bite of Roger Waters' \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking\\"?  No.  But I'll take \\"About Face\\" over that album any day.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I actually think Gilmour's solo albums in general outshine anything by Floyd or Waters since \\"The Wall\\". And \\"About Face\\" is probably, overall, the best of the lot.
0375704027|4.0|Norwegian Wood is the recollections of a Japanese college student, Toru Watanabe.  When Toru was 16, his best friend Kizuki committed suicide.  Kizuki's girlfriend, Noako, and Toru form a friendship that deepens over time, always haunted by the memory of their mutual friend.  Noako herself has mental issues, withdrawing from society and into herself.  She checks herself into a private sanitarium where she rooms with an older woman, Reiko, who also becomes friends with Toru.<br /><br />While Noako has disappeared within herself, Toru withdraws in his own way.  He goes through the motions of attending school, while student protests and riots go on around him as the turbulent 60s prepare to come to a close.  He goes out drinking and womanizing with his friend Nagasawa, but quickly realizes how facile it is.  Nothing seems to touch him until he meets the free-spirited Midori.  Even then, Toru feels like he cannot betray Noako, even if he cannot be with her.<br /><br />The novel revolves around relationships in threes.  Toru, Noako, and Midori; Toru, Midori, and Midori's never seen boyfriend; Noako, Toru, and Reiko; Toru, Nagasawa, and Nagasawa's put-upon girlfriend, Hatsumi; and Toru, Noako, and Kizuki.  Even though Kizuki is dead, he remains tethered to Noako and Toru, an almost tangible presence.  These complex relationships are realistically rendered by Murakami.<br /><br />The language is both beautiful and frank.  Sex is depicted as personal or impersonal depending on the participants.  The characters are quirky and damaged, but seem very real, sometimes maddeningly so.  The story is deceptively simple, but it absolutely engrossed me, maybe because Noako reminded me strongly of someone I used to know many years ago.  This is one novel that will stay with me for some time to come and I fully intend to read some of Murakami's other work.

Are they in anyway associated with the filmcast, and are they collecting meager royalties from this film? If you are looking for a depressing movie that will get you into a bad mood, then please watch this movie. I am currently an hour into the film and there is no talking by people or narration. Just this odd depressing organ music like you are at a Dr. Phibes funeral or something. They just pan from picture to picture of society and cities and power lines etc. etc. For the first 10 minutes of the movie they show some nice nature scenery, yet the depressing organ music is in the background and ruins the scenery. The only thing I did find interesting were the city pictures of people in the 70's and how they dressed. One final sincere warning. If you are a depressed person facing a life crisis. Don't watch this movie as it will make it worse.
B001CC7PKS|4.0|Based on Frank Miller's run on Daredevil, Affleck plays Matt Murdoch, a lawyer who lost his sight in a horrible chemical accident. Out of that tragedy, all his other senses began working at super human levels. He also has the ability to see via sound, like some advanced sonar. The story begins with Daredevil badly injured and near death, as his life flashes before his eyes the story unfolds. As he recollects his tough childhood, the murder of his father and the death of his love Elektra (Garner), he realizes they all tie back to the Kingpin (Duncan). The masked avenger must find his last ounce of strength to face his toughest foe yet.<br /><br />This movie will please any hardcore fan. Some of the images in this movie are ripped right out of the comics. I have seen both versions and the Director's Cut is far superior. A story arc is added that not only shows in detail the friendship between Matt and Froggy (Favreau), it also defines him as an attorney and provides a better sub plot to the Kingpin's control of all the crime in the city. The relationship between Elektra is also changed slightly. I don't provide more because I hate spoilers!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: It looks very good and the sound is excellent. All the special features of the Director's Cut are carried over. FINAL VERDICT: Hardcore fans should upgrade because the picture and sound are better. Casual fans, this is not upgrade worthy.
0061684384|5.0|I spent a very enjoyable evening with this book. As is appropriate for a book on tattoos and a tattoo artist, this book is a visual feast. There are pictures of tattoos, but also family photos and creative odds and ends. The cover even has the padded feel of the photo albums I remember from my childhood. From what I understand about the author, she is a perfectionist, and it shows in the layout and the aesthetic. I can't remember the last time I read a book so colorful and pretty, outside of an illustrated fairytale book.<br /><br />If you want a book about tattoos and the stories around them, and most good tattoos tell something about what the person wearing them values, this is a great book on just that. What I find interesting about Kat Von D's personal tattoos is what it says about her daring nature. She has a \\"yearbook\\" leg where friends, professional and non-professional alike, are allowed to leave a message -- and that's either very brave or very dumb, and Ms. Von D doesn't seem dumb. There are many other stories contained in the book about why people select the tattoos they do, and since the author specializes in portraits, these tales are evocative and made the reader/viewer reflect on the people she's loved, some of whom are gone, and what snapshot or moment in time is worth capturing.<br /><br />Very nicely done!

B000001GX8|5.0|I could't ever believe what I have read: there is someone that states this recording of Figaro is \\"too slow\\".   The reviewer that gave two stars to this performance has failed to demonstrate the obvious: that she could understand the opera, above all. Le Nozze di Figaro isn't only a light comedy where the young page boy (sung by a mezzo) gets bashed all the way around by the Count, who even finds him hidden under a bed, or the funny Don Basilio / Don Bartolo parts, and so on. No. This opera is themed around something that is very dear to us, mankind: freedom. Freedom to love, that is. There is a very profound message that people seem not to get from the music and the words.   \\"Porgi Amor\\", the Countess Rosina's first aria, isn't \\"dragged\\" by Böhm's slow tempo. At the end of Act One you have Figaro's \\"Non più andrai\\", wich is easily the most instantly recognized tune of the opera, and then the action shifts swiftly to the Countess' bedroom, where she sings of despair and of how she is ultimately abandoned by her husband. One must listen either to Janowitz or Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (get Böhm's 1957 Salzburg, please!) in order to understand this. No other singer can do it that well.    I could go on, and on, and on, and point out the values of this recording. But I can't, really. They are too many. Ultimately, I can say that everything is simply in its proper place. The sound quality, the orchestra, the faultless conducting, the scheming Figaro of Hermann Prey, the noble Count Almaviva of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, the beautiful Countess of Gundula Janowitz (her diction isn't always the best, she says \\"Tzusanna\\" instead of \\"Susanna\\", but with a voice like that, who cares?), and so on.    Ignore the noise, don't care about these so-called \\"period-performances\\". The Mozart-Da Ponte operas are artistic treasures to all mankind. You can't submit them to anything less than perfection, wich you get very very close to, here.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I first saw this DVD presented on a PBS station.  Even though they only played about one third of this DVD a few songs at a time with fund rising in between I knew that I had to get this DVD.  The next day I went to Amazon.com and bought it.  This is one of the best concerts I have ever seen.  Leonard's performance is absolutely riveting.  The reason for this I feel is the passion that he gives to the presentation of each song.  On one song he doesn't even sing it; he recites it like poetry which it is.  He is accompanied with a full band and backup singers which are all amazing artists and add to the performance if that is even possible.  I have watched this DVD many times now and have not yet tired of it.
0393072231|5.0|Amazing book. The remarkable story of several different people/small firms who became convinced that the mortgage market had become a disaster waiting to happen, and made a lot of money in the end betting against the market and shorting the big banks.    Naive investors and ultimately \\"Smart Money Wall St. firms\\" ended up buying hundreds of $ billion in \\"AAA\\" securities composed mostly of very bad mortgages, with the ratings agencies everyone depended on converting piles of crap into investment grade with a wave of a magic wand, for a very nice fee. With nothing resembling research or due diligence going on.    It helped (until 2005) having AIG insuring these for mere basis points!    Lewis' talent for storytelling makes all this interesting and easy to read, even fun! If it weren't true, it would have been too much even for fiction. But sadly enough its all true. We will be digging out for some time to come. \\"
0525423842|5.0|Haven't read a Grisham novel in a while. (Shame on me, being a southerner and all, even though I now live in Colorado!) But, Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer, is a fun, quirky, young adult novel that is a great read for all ages. Theo reasons a lot like an adult, as do most fictional kid detectives--in this case lawyer, which makes the book all-the-more a fun read for those young and young at heart.
B001HN694K|5.0|A lot of people disliked this movie because it wasn't exactly like the book.  I liked the movie and the special effects/CGI. I also like it when \\"they\\" (writers, producers, directors) bring present day to \\"historical\\" stories. Wasn't the same thing done by the authors in the times the books were originally written, after all? Let's face it, most people hate change and rebel against it. I say let's look at the new version with new eyes. I thought it was brilliant to make it Alice's second trip down the rabbit hole, thus allowing an entirely new story - one where Alice is more grown up, and thus not as non-sensey (yeah, yeah, not a word, but I like it) because she is no longer a child. Isn't that what really happens? We leave behind our childhood dreams....    p.s. could have done without that insane dance by the Mad Hatter! LOL

B001993Y2C|4.0|As others have said, the episodes themselves are absolutely fantastic. No questions. Six of out five stars, they're that good. Box is horrible - I put them in a DVD case anyway, no biggie. The cylon toy is worthless - I don't care. The disks don't have episode labels - you can print a list.    My complaints: The episode menu was designed to show four episodes. A few disks have five, and I found it hard to see the little arrow pointing at a screen for a single fifth episode. I finally realized I had skipped a few episodes when the \\"Last time...\\" recap showed stuff I hadn't seen. Now I know to look, and it's not as big a deal.    I wish they didn't show a sequence of scenes from the current episode in the opening credits. Shut your eyes when the drums kick in in the music if you don't like spoilers.    What I hate more than anything... I bought the entire set. I don't need the lame welcome by the producer every time I hit play for any episode that is on the first disk of any season. I watch one episode a day, and that stupid things plays well over a dozen times. Why? Why make that even spin up a second time? Acknowledge we bought the whole thing and only queue it up for the very first episode of the series. Seriously. I gave it four on that alone.

Also important to note, the MP3 version includes the track \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\", from the soundtrack to Legend.

0553062182|5.0|If you have small kids or siblings and you want to help raise them to be emotionally healthier while growing up, you need to read this book!  It helps you understand why children are different rather than judging or comparing one to another.  It helps you coach your over-senstive child better when you understand his personality!  If you are a judgemental person, read it also to become more compassionate!    I LOVED it!  It helped me understand myself NOW at my 'maturer' present age better and became more compassionate and aware of others' behaviors due to being over-sensitive. If you love self-help books, I HIGHLY recommend it.

0440246008|4.0|4 1/2 stars.<br />Once more, Reacher arrives at a destination and trouble seeks him out.<br /><br />In this tenth episode of the Jack Reacher saga, Reacher is enjoying his coffee at an outdoor restaurant in New York. From his many years of being a Military Police Officer, he's fully observant of his surroundings. He spots a man cross his line of vision, get into a Mercedes and drive away.<br /><br />The next night, he's back at the restaurant when a military looking man with a British accent is asking people if they noticed anything the previous night. When Reacher tells him what he saw, the man asks if he would tell this to his boss, Edward Lane.<br /><br />Lane lives at the Dakota House and tells Reacher that his wife, Kate, and her daughter from a previous marriage, Jade, have been kidnapped. What Reacher observed was the man with the ransome money leaving the pickup. Lane also states that this also happened five years ago. Lane's first wife, Anne, was kidnapped but when he went to the police, the kidnappers killed Anne. Now, he doesn't want police involved.<br /><br />Even though Lane is accompanied by a group of mercenaries, Reacher tells him that they lack investigative skills. Since that's his background, he offers to help.<br /><br />The investigation proceeds slowly as the kidnappers call and increase their demand. Later, Reacher is able to be on his own and arranges to meet with the FBI agent in charge of the first kidnapping, Lauren Pauling.<br /><br />Pauling is still racked with guilt over Anne's killing. However, Reacher sees that he can trust her and so they work together to solve the case.<br /><br />This is a fast moving, suspenseful story, complete with plot twists, deception and packed with adventure. Reacher, as always, is one of the most courageous, dependable, and resourceful characters in literature.
B002ZCY7SW|3.0|I am a 24 fan.  I enjoyed the series from day one, hour one.  As with many shows, there are great episodes and great season's.  Jack Bauer kicked butt and for the most part the written and the show was well written and the acting was exceptional.  Kiefer Sutherland did an outstanding job playing Jack Bauer for 8 seasons.  He has made Jack an action hero equivalent to James Bond or John McClane.    Now about season 8.  The final 3 years weren't the best seasons and the show started to become formulaic.  I feel the writers, network, and producers didn't want to stray too much from what they thought fan's loved.  I would have liked to have seen the show grow, but that is a whole other topic.  This season has some great episodes but the show started to fall in a routine that was becoming annoying.  If the US government is this inept, and it might be, than we are lucky to have a country.  The conspiracies' started to get outrageous.  I started thinking everyone is a spy and CTU is run by a bunch on monkey's, aka bureaucrats, same thing.  It made China, Russia, and everyone else look smarter with better agents than the US. Yes, Jack usually saved the day by hour 24, but they started to create crazy scenarios.  Season 8 continued with the same premise, the US is in danger, about to be attacked and Jack is needed to save the day.  I would think after Season 5 Jack would be treated as a national treasure instead of a liability only called upon when the US needed his help.  OH well, if you can't get over the ridiculous circumstances that the US calls for Jack's aid, you will like this show.  Season 8 was at times rushed and the scenarios a bit exaggerated.  The brought back another KIM type character in Kayla Hassan.  She is beautiful, but you get annoyed by the child like innocence, to the point that you wish someone would just kill her.  I hate the storyline with President Taylor this season.  Such a great character that owes Jack Bauer so much, is willing to do what she does to him.  I feel they took it too far.  They could have written that whole premise is a more plausible manner.  We American's must elect the worse President's.  And President's must pick a bunch of weasels to serve under them.  God help the US is this is true.  I feel 24 took the feel the US was unhappy with our real President Bush, let's see how we can show the American people why it is important to elect someone competent.  Back to this Season, sorry for the tangent, I had to vent.  Several show's this season are too long or useless.  There are 3 season's of 24 that EVERY episode is excellent, see below, or above average.  This isn't one of them.  I say about 3 great hours and 8 good hours, but one fantastic hour is the ending.  The ending is classic \\"24\\" that made this season worth watching.    I will add this to my collection with season's 1, 3, and 4.  I like the bookends concept in buying shows.  Similar to many of my other collections.  I will buy the season's I love, but always the 1st and last seasons of a great shows, which \\"24\\" belongs.
0783114893|3.0|This suspenseful film holds up really well.  The movie unfolds in a very taut style and the pacing is relentless.  I had never heard of this film's director, but he did an excellent job in all respects.<br /><br />The acting is top-notch.  Rutger Hauer is everything that you want in a villain.  He seems very much like a human monster.  He is rough at the edges, dirty and dusty, but he is also mysterious and unknowable.  Perhaps he is a supernatural force and is not human at all.  You can't really tell.  You can't even guess what the hell he is.<br /><br />C. Thomas Howell is completely genuine as the naive kid who picks up the hitcher along a very, very lonely stretch of road out in the desert.  The hitcher is this kid's worst nightmare come unbearably true.  The violence and fear begin almost immediately.<br /><br />This is not the kind of movie you should sit back and analyze once it is over.  There is not much of anything to analyze about a roller coaster ride and that is what this film is.  Just hang on and eat it up.<br /><br />The acting is great.  The pacing is great.  The scenery is great.  And, if you buy this movie here at Amazon, the price is great as well.  Can't beat it.
0525423842|3.0|World famous legal author John Grisham's young adult book is built around the central character thirteen-year-old eighth grader Theodore \\"Theo\\" Boone. Theo's parents are both lawyers... his Father specializes in real estate and his Mother is a divorce lawyer. The depiction of Theo's family life along with Theo's views of his parents through narration surprisingly does not paint a picture of a \\"Beaver Cleaver\\" or \\"Father Knows Best\\" family. In Theo's eyes his Dad is messy... smokes a smelly pipe... and practices real estate law which \\"was the most boring of all areas of the law.\\" Throw in Uncle Ike who for some not very clear reason is on the outs with Theo's Mom and Dad and now has a drinking problem... and the reader never gets the \\"warm-fuzzies\\" about the Boone family.<br /><br />But young Theo is entertainingly painted as a legal \\"wunderkind\\". Where most youngsters his age dream of being a big league ballplayer... rock star... or movie star... Theo's every living breath is centered on becoming either a lawyer or a judge. Depending on how the reader decides to view the portrayal of this unlicensed legal genius... you'll either accept Theo as the barrister reincarnation of \\"DOOGIE HOWSER, M.D. (Although Doogie was actually a certified doctor)... or you'll think it's ridiculous. I chose to place my tongue gently in cheek and accept the ride. When the Duffy murder case takes place, which is the biggest case in fifty years in this town... Theo is beside himself. Since Theo almost lives at the court house... which along with his parents law office... is bike riding distance from home and school... he knows every security guard... every clerk... and almost every judge in the court house. When the Duffy trial starts there isn't a seat in the house available. Unless of course your name is Theo Boone and you have connections with the Judge.... So he not only gets a seat for himself... he gets seats for his entire government class at school.<br /><br />The night before the trial starts is for Theo... akin to the night before a pitcher gets set to pitch the seventh game of the World Series... or a quarterback the night before the Super Bowl. \\"THEO HAD BEEN UNABLE TO EAT BREAKFAST, AND HE'D SLEPT LITTLE.

B0028RXXE8|4.0|I enjoyed watching this series, it was very entertaining.  The packaging needs some work.  The sleeves are too tight for the discs.
0061148512|3.0|I read this book because I wanted to see what the big deal was.  Apparently the author took her own life a month after the book first appeared in 1963 under her pseudonym \\"Victoria Lucas.\\"  Critics say the character Esther Greenwood is an extension of the author.  Perhaps it also refers to the book of Esther.  I don't know.  Nevetheless, it is a typical 1960's book.  The protagonist is well compared with Holden Caulfield of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (another overrated book).  Holden and Esther both are in New York City, the former in the 40's, the latter in the 50's.  Like Holden, Esther gradually loses her marbles.  In fact, the first part of the book differs radically from the second half of the book.  The first part is the narrator during sanity, the latter part is the narrator during insanity, so to speak.  Although Esther loses it more than Holden, Holden narrates his story from the nut house.  She is the classic mixed up person of Hedda Gabler of Ibsen lore.  Esther too, like Hedda Gabler, attempts suicide.  What is tragic is not the descent into mental anarchy of Esther, but the fact her problems in the novel were essentially problems because she was too immature to deal with them.  This is evident by Esther's inability to make choices.  All choices have unforeseen consequences.  No one is omnniscient.  The solution to her problems was she needed to simply \\"grow up.\\"  It's like falling into suicidal despair because your favorite soap opera was canceled.  Some critics have suggested that Esther's problems have to do with repression.  In part, I agree.  But the definition of that repression has been skewed.  The objectification of women is not liberation unless you bought into the twisted logic of the political left.  Unless women are liberated to clean house, cook meals, send the kids off to school, clean laundry and go to the grocery store, this repression will only continue.  Similarly, white men need to be liberated from the defamation perpetrated against them by the so-called House of David laying at the white man's feet the alleged repression of women and minorities.  It is noteworthy that the number of suicides amongst women increased dramatically when women were shamed away from their natural vocation as wife and mother.  Unless women are allowed to be women and not pinups for greedy men like Hugh Hefner, Al Goldstein and other members of the synagogue, to be objectified and marketed like slabs of meat, they will remain in bondage to unnatural repression.

0385504225|3.0|I had the book but I could not read it because it was so slow paced therefore I listened to it in the subway, when doing laundry etc. I loved the Da Vinci Code because it brought the old world into the 21st century. The Lost Symbol on the other hand seems to be generic and pushed to fit a preconceived mold. I hope that Dan Brown will get back on track and write for himself not for the camera.     Things I liked  -Once again we were able to follow an old mystery to be revealed.  -The allegory about the staircase and the hidden human potential was inspiring.      Things I did not like  -I hate when in the middle of the book I figure out something that supposed to be a bombshell for the end. This happen when Mal'akh recalls the prison for the firs time. Then knowing his true identity till the end of the book was a pain.   -I like descriptions but too much of it makes me want to flip the pages like pressing fast forward on the DVR.  -I find it annoying when I want to scream at the character that they are stupid  especially when at the beginning they are describe as the smart type.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This was another great tale by Dan Brown. I know that I have been waiting patiently for this book to come out and was excited to have it automatically downloaded to my Kindle on day one of its release.     Like his past thrillers, this one takes you on a roller coaster of a ride with one turn after another. Just when you figure out what is coming up next there is another dip or turn that again changes the outlook.     I will say that while you may see what is coming there will be surprises you won't see. The concept was intriguing and I hope that the Masons will not take this book as hard as the Christians took The Da Vinci Code since it is after all a work of fiction and meant to entertain.     I highly recommend this book for its ease of reading and quickly moving plot lines.

B0013LPS8E|4.0|It is hard to believe that this album was released over 25 years ago, but to my ears it remains one of the top albums in the entire U2 catalogue.  Listening to this re-master from a perspective of many years down the line, the songs still bristle with an urgency that blasts through the stereo.  These songs still sound both important and relevant even after the passage of so much time.  The music on this disc is relatively simple in nature, but like many of the greats of rock n roll, U2 are experts at using the skills that they do possess to make quality music.  The album produced the huge singles \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"New Years Day\\" for which it is best known, but almost all of the rest of the tracks here are equally as good.  The only real track here that sounds dated is \\"The Refugee\\" and even it is such a great song that you hardly notice the 80's polished punk sound.  My only complaint with the album and the reason I give it four stars instead of five is the final track \\"40\\".  Through much of the track Bono is singing quite noticeably out of tune.  It is so bad that the song is difficult for me to listen to.  The live version on \\"Under A Blood Red Sky\\" is much, much better.  Other than \\"40\\" this is a five star album all the way and still an essential album of the 80's.
B001UREJWM|5.0|First, to all the knuckleheads who gave this cd one, two or even three stars:  What cd were you listening to? Everyone thinks if its not like the early stuff its just no good. Well, it just aint so. I was lucky enough to see DIO's last show in Atlantic City, NJ on 8/31/09 with H&H in support of this album. It was amazing. I honestly like every track on the disc but some are stronger than others like practically any groups cd's.  My favorites are Follow the Tears (pure doom Iommi riff and Geezer's busy bass), Fear (upbeat and catchy and very powerful), Rock and Roll Angel (love the guitar solo and acoustic intro to solo--Iommi just tears it up), Bible Black, Breaking Into Heaven, Atom and Evil.  Dio's vocals soar and add a lot of melody to the sabbath duo's gloomy (in a good very metal way)riffs.  RIP RJD. You were and still are the greatest of all time!

B001HN694K|3.0|Bright colors, johnny depp, helena boham carter all point to tim burton movie. It had all the potential to be a great version of this wonderful movie, but instead it becomes very tiring. It is just a collection of Burton's past accomplishments wrapped up in the dressing of a classic. It just has many of the same old tired tricks that go no where quick. He could have innovated somewhere, as the book provides ample opportunity, but it never comes. Worth a redbox rental, but not worth buying.

One never sees any<br />strategy for victory -- merely physical brute force as players pummel each other, and then one breaks free to kick a goal.

In fact, if there were any clever dialogue, you would be unable to<br />understand it, because the sound track is so muffled, and nearly everyone mumbles.

I love pretty much everything about the X41s except the mic is too sensitive, I cant have a fan on and play at the same time or the X41s will pick it up.<br /><br />The Trittons on the other hand cost more nowadays for one. Two they are a huge wire mess. Three the sound is hollow sounding compared to the X41s, gunshots sound like yur thumping a can and explosions sound like your thumping a bucket lol. Also there are too many controls IMO, maybe im just old fashioned though. The only reason I even considered buying the AX PROs is bacause I read alot of reviews saying they had way better sound, well they dont. I would only recommend the AX PROs over the X41s if you live in an apartment becuase there will be alot more wireless routers around you.

0525423842|3.0|So why would such a great writer write something so flawed?  Did he not want to go into the YA/kid market but his publisher made him do it?  Does he love law so much that he wanted to get kids interested in it without any regard for other YA/kid book elements?  I'm thinking the latter, but with basically no action for the first third, a plot with very few interesting twists, basically flat characters, and an unrealistic setting (a public school where classes consist of sixteen well-behaved 8th grade male students, where only 50% of the students have cell phones, where they \\"were too young for romance\\", where they have recess and cheerleaders, etc.), the jury is still out on this one!  On the bright side, something about Grisham's voice does carry the story along, and the short chapters make for quick reading.  The story line of big murder trial in town with Theodore getting involved through a surprise witness is an interesting enough idea with sprinklings of court and law lessons, but I don't know how it will be judged by its intended audience.

Even if you're not an animal lover, the story Enzo tells will, at times, rip your guts out and at other times, make you chuckle.  It's a wonderful book.

This is the specific purpose i purchased this. It does what others do at 1/3 the cost.  I would highly recommend this to all.  It fits in your pocket or backpack easily.  It takes a lot for me to be impressed with sharpening tools and this does it.
0393327655|3.0|I was thoroughly enjoying this book, but feeling apprehensive about what seems to be a preoccupation with Islamic fundamentalism. Indeed half way through the book Harris embarks on a tirade that is an excellent exposition of the religious assumptions he has attempted to expose. Perhaps there is some truth to his theories concerning the influence of fundamentalist ideas on Islamic 'terrorism', but Harris leaves little room for doubt that his is the only correct view. The fact is that fundamentalism and blind adherence to untested, or untestable assumptions is not particular to religion, and it is here that Harris' seems to have missed the point entirely: he claims that Nazi persecution was religious in nature, i.e. that it had its historic roots in Christian anti-semitism. Most experts tend to view racial theory as a hollow justification for other more insidious processes at work in the Nazi plans, including industrialisation. Keep in mind that Jews were not the only victims of the Nazi's.     Another issue I have with this book is the juxtaposing of religion and rationalism, as if rational thought could not spawn equally disastrous consequences. Harris fails to question his own assumptions about the nature of ethics. Just where do these come from if we forgo intuition? My feeling is that this writer is too young to have deeply contemplated religious questions and the meaning of life. Certainly all 'holy books' are full of abominations that are difficult to interpret other than literally. Perhaps the Q'uran more so. But the fact is that one needs to go beyond the superficial meaning of religious texts. The fact is that a great many people are capable of ignoring those parts of a religious text that either mean nothing to them, or would otherwise force them to commit violence. It is only under particular social and economic conditions that fundamentalism thrives. This book should be approached with caution lest it inspire exactly the type of extremist views it claimsto expose in religion!
B003ELOQD4|4.0|The low dark lighting at the venue is problematic,but this is not a new problem with concerts.I own about 500 or so dvd and blu-ray concerts and the dramatic effect of dark atmospheric lighting makes for a great concert experience,but doesn't necessarily translate that well for picture quality.That being said ,the picture quality is still very good.More importantly to me are performance and sound,which are exceptional here.Everyone has there favourites but the setlist for me leans way to heavily on 2000 onward and little from their best albums of the 80's and early nineties,but a great disc nonetheless.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I received this in the mail today and was very excited as I never got to see this movie in theatres. I thought the movie itself was great. The plot was good, nothing amazing but the moral behind the story was what I liked. It really shows how we as a race are destroying ourselves and everything around. The special effects, graphics and sound were awesome. There were parts where I couldn't tell if the Na'vi were actual real actors or computer generated.    Anyways, I didn't really read any reviews on this product, I just went by all the hype I heard while it was in theatres. The movie was good, but I have to say I was disappointed when I watched the movie and after I looked for special features. I looked on the blu-ray disc; nothing at the main menu. All that was available was some sound options, subtitles and scenes. Popped in the DVD, nothing on that. Read those little sheets of paper inside the case to see if you had to download it online through a PC. Nothing. The special features really were a let down, I can't remember the last time I bought a movie and had no special features on it. Maybe during the VHS days...    Anyways, 3/5 stars since I was just the movie with nothing special. It's still not a bad deal since you get the DVD and Blu-ray at such a great price on Amazon. For the movie itself, I would give it 4.5/5 stars just because I thought the plot could have been a little better.

0525423842|3.0|Mr. Grisham's early books were page turners, I have not really enjoyed the last few. I quit buying them and get them at the library now, because because I don't really want to add them to my own library. Having said that, I do like his style of writing and I thought my 12 year old might like a story about a boy who wanted to be a lawyer (as he has indicated some interest in that area). There are not very many good books for boys under the age of 14 and I'm glad someone else has entered the arena.    The book is a little slow and not very suspenseful, I am not sure my son will want to stick with it to the end. However, I thought (unlike some adult readers) that it was about an regular kid in a regular town. It was nice that he had normal parents, a regular life, no abuse, no sex, a dog, and a bike. He didn't smoke, didn't seem to want to, he didn't drink or do drugs, YES!!! He was aware of those things and I thought it was cute that all the kids in school came to him for advice. Kids go to other kids for advice first.    I think Mr. Grisham can have a hit with this series if he gets a little more adventuresome. I hope he keeps all the good elements in, such as, Theodore loving and respecting his parents and going to them for advice. What a SMART kid, and what a good (and not goody goody) example for young people.

0446563048|5.0|\\"The biggest vision would be to build the Zappos brand to be about the very best customer service,\\" writes Tony Hsieh in his \\"Delivering Happiness: A path to profits, passion, and purpose.\\" Hsieh refers to the early days when he and his team were still shaping the Zappos model in a market inundated by just shoe sellers. Financial challenges were also posing a threat to Zappos livelihood. How to survive the financial storm? How to make a difference? What model to follow? How to build a long lasting brand? Those questions led Hsieh to reflect on \\"WHY\\" they were doing what they were doing as he writes in his book. It started a process of looking at the same problem from a different perspective: Defining a long term vision, a higher purpose, of the company, higher and bigger than the company and its members. That statement had to embody the genuine dreams of all Zappos employees from the early days, beyond just making money and selling shoes online. Hsieh brightly tells how after 7 years of collective growth and learning a greater cause was defined \\"Zappos is about delivering happiness to the world\\", not just rhetoric. The mission statement is a genuine commitment written in Zappos employee's genes that does both challenge and inspire the quest for new standards in the bloody arena of customer service.<br /><br />\\"Delivering Happiness: A path to profits, passion, and purpose\\" summarizes the learning process that Hsieh and his team undertook to create core values and reach their dream of building an excellent customer service company in a very competitive market. Tony Hsieh himself started elaborating about the essential role of culture in Zappos. Culture was the full set of shared experiences and beliefs that bonded all employees and were vibrantly describe in their core values. With great clarity Hsieh would write an article for his blog titled \\"Your culture is your brand,\\" where he would remark Zappos employees the importance of creating a brand not around the obvious item they were selling--shoes but instead to create a brand around their sparkling passion for customer service. According to Hsieh, stressing culture became the new mantra for all employees. That is how Zappos systematically organize all that body of principles in what they call the \\"Culture Book.\\" The \\"Culture Book\\" is one of Zappos most precious assets and is the result of all employees' contributions. It is designed to implement in a more practical level actions to reach the company's vision.<br /><br />Tony Hsieh's book offers his recipe for delivering happiness: 1) Refining customer service: \\"Client receives correct item (meets expectations); 2) Free shipping (meets desires); and 3) Surprise upgrade to overnight shipping (meets unrecognized needs). These actions are the genuine expression of a greater cause and a strong set of values. Gross sales, from zero to more than a billion dollars per year, prove this novel approach both right and profitable. Hsieh, ultimately, makes his case \\"It turns out that we're all taking different paths in pursuit of the same goal: happiness.\\" After reading the book you get the flavor that happiness is not anymore an unreachable abstraction shyly hidden in our mind. Happiness is the new paradigm that ignites our passion and it can be applied to business as well. \\"Delivering Happiness: A path to profits, passion, and purpose\\" is an inspiring book.

0802798225|4.0|Brittany Ellis' life has to be perfect, even though her sister, Shelley has cerebral palsy and have autism. Her mother freaks out and gives her the guilt tip when she does maintain or exceeds her expectation. Her boyfriend Colin came home this summer changed and pressuring her into having sex. She is surrounded by people who thinks image is everything and doesn't know who she can fully trust. To make matters worse her chemistry teacher partnered him with gangbanger.         Alex Fuentes lives on the south side of town, where he needs to carry a gun for protection and maintain his troublemaker and dangerous appearance. Being a member of the Latino Blood gang, he had no choice but to act like one. But in reality he had never used his gun, he keeps his family safe, her works to help his mother put food on their table and he really wanted to go to college. Ever since his dad died he had always thought that his destiny was already written and that he had no choice but to follow it, little did he know his infuriating white girl chemistry partner will change all that.      I love the story it is definitely a change from all the PNR that I've been reading. Two different cultures and two different worlds collide. The story is very realistic and very relatable. Brittany can be perceived as this shallow and spoon fed person, and she was at some point until she started following her heart. I know that sounds cheesy but that is exactly what she did, suddenly let herself go. To become happy with Alex even though his world is dangerous. I've seen one too many gang related documentary on Nat Geo and History channel to say that Alex had it easy when he finally decided to quit the gang. I was glad that his family was safe and that he made a pretty darn good future for himself and Brittany.

0143116738|5.0|I have read The Element with the leadership team at my elementary school. We have decided that as teachers of young children, we have to create in them a passion that inspires their lives rather than just getting them to pass tests.<br /><br />It is CLEAR that the tests and standards we currently live and die by for mainly political reasons are an insane way to measure student success. True innovation and success in life is almost NEVER measured by passing some test invented by some bureaucrat.<br /><br />We are choosing what we believe is our sacred duty to help young people find their true path, prepare passionately for it, and then create their own success.<br /><br />This book and its ideas put into words the manifesto for the generation of educators who are teaching the kids who will be creating base knowledge that will inform the 22nd century (do the math on current Kindergarten kids!!!!). We have to be better than tests that do nothing more that inform how wealthy children's families are or how well kids and schools have played the losing assessment and accountability game created under NCLB.<br /><br />We should all read this and move on to a much better system of education and therefore a much brighter future!
B002VECM4A|1.0|I have had time to digest Precious for a long time now. And I've come to a conclusion: There TRULY are an incredible number of stereotypes piled one upon another in the two main characters.     Monique did an incredible acting job in one of the last scenes, but that doesn't negate the fact that her dark-skinned black character was poor, loud, lazy, welfare-abusing, and a deviant (the last one being beyond stereo-type in the 21st century)      While Tyler Perry and Oprah were behind the making of this story, that doesn't make them immune to making a movie based on black stereotypes. All of us are living in the same country watching the same harmful images over and over again. None of us is immune to absorbing stereotypes and failing to recognize them--even stereotypes derogatory to one's own race.     Tyler Perry's movies--while I am a fan of those B-movies of his--do cross over into stereotype-land quite often. Yet, Tyler Perry's movies have music blacks can identify with, crazy characters (even some of the stereotypes) to identify with, humor blacks can identify with, and biblical values that come out when times get rough. But that doesn't erase the fact that the stereotypes are always there. And Precious is not only NOT an exception it is worse by far (see the laundry list above for Monique's character).      When I first watched this movie, through the lens of FUBU (for us by us) I saw all the characters as black--the same way I see my own family.  But I still (initially) came away from the movie wondering if the point being made about sexual abuse wasn't buried in the muck.     Later, when I realized all the attention the movie was getting and that the general public was watching the movie too, I saw it through new eyes and realized something else. This movie is similar to The Blindside in that all the characters that have any proactive-ness to them at all--are pale. In The Blindside the heroes are white, while in Precious all the rescue-ers are light-skinned (all the actors in rescue-er roles appear to be first-generation, mixed race) which  might make Precious a 21st century Uncle Tom's Cabin.    Compare Precious and The Blindside to The Secret Life of Bees: Dakota Fanning's character is abused and needs help, but she is not some blank-faced blob who will simply expire if someone doesn't come along and scrape her off the ground. I don't know why movies like Precious and The Blindside can only feel satisfying to some folk if the darker-skinned person being helped is an ultimate victim, nearly crawling on their hands and knees. (Yes, The Blindside's a true story--but so what? There are millions of OTHER true uplifting interracial stories that could be told--but they ARE NOT interesting unless...there is a dark,helpless,ultimate victim and a light/white hero)    Electing a Black President isn't the end of progress. It's the next leap forward. And I see that progress has already been made in imagery we're seeing just on television: Look at how many people of color (all shades and ethnicities) are being shown with whole families selling laundry detergent or going to department stores in commercials now. And I think, down the road, consciousness will raise and more and more people will see Precious as stereotyping mess that it is.    (By the way, a movie called \\"The Celebration\\" deals with sexual abuse and the struggles of the adults who've endured it much, much better if you can deal with the subtitles---It's excellent.It even touches on race a bit.)
0375842209|4.0|Enjoyed the character development as well as the bits of humor even though set during a dismal period in history.

B001ECQ6E2|2.0|first of all the quality of the Blu-ray was HORRIBLE. The picture and sound were like watching it on regular tv, not even as good as a DVD. I just watched this instead of when I bought it otherwise I would return it. The story was boring, the acting was terrible especially by the main actor, he was terrible in this kind of film. I have always seen him in westerns where he fit in just right, but to me stands out like a sore thumb in this movie, he doesn't have the ump that is normally shown in these type of films. I am a very big fan of any roman picture, not this one though, its going from my collection.

B003JTHTHG|3.0|Monica Ali has written a historically interesting book about the Bangladeshi experience in England; however, most of the characters could have been better developed.  A reader can have an interesting few hours by reading the sister's letters and skimming the rest of the book.<br /><br />Ms. Ali's words brought to life the poverty and struggles experienced by many of the English Bangladeshi immigrants.  The story Ms. Ali created about the main character's sister, who still resided in Bangladesh, and the way that her story her told, by letters, was by far the most interesting part of the book.<br /><br />I wished that Ms. Ali would have made the lives of the main character's daughters more interesting.  The daughters appeared to be uni-dimensional, one dutiful and the other argumentative.  The girls' desire to become more western and less Bangladeshi could have been better developed.<br /><br />Similarly, the main character's love affair could not have been more boring.  I repeatedly wondered why the main character chose to have a relationship with such an uninteresting, unattractive \\"boy.\\"

0792844882|3.0|At the 1995 Golden Raspberry Awards, director Paul Verhoeven proudly appeared to receive the Razzie for worst picture.  That spoke volumes to me.  If \\"Showgirls\\" was deemed one of the worst films of the decade, and the director accepted the Razzie with grace, something tells me that he knew what he's doing.  Probably.  Some of you have probably heard that it's a mess...it IS a mess.  The movie is definitely raunchy and offensive to the core, but to me, that's the point of the whole film.<br /><br />\\"Showgirls\\" is devoid of class, despite the luminous lights and vivid colors that are on constant display.  There were stripper joints where all the girls are going full-frontal and the private dances are VERY explicit, the women bicker and backstab each other, men are worse than pigs with their misogynist words of exchanges (and ladies somehow find them flattering), every single event has been outrageous and unrealistic; I may not have been to Las Vegas but I'm certain it isn't as grody as the film depicted, but then no one really talks about what happens in Vegas.  The lead character, Nomi Molane, is established as a hostile, unlikable character who laughably thinks isn't a hooker even though she's doing all those dirty moves in full-on nudity and the girl doesn't grow to be much better; she gets worse as she tries to steal another woman's success in a gaudy \\"All About Eve\\" fashion.  Her relationship with popular showgirl Cristal is a bizarre one.  Cristal loves to damage Nomi's pride even though she gave her the opportunity to join her dance troupe, almost as she wants to get hurt by her; the sadistic relationship is almost random, especially since Nomi started to hate her because she insulted her nails.<br /><br />There's not a single redeemable character among the cast, almost everyone is represented on the dark side of the Fabulous Las Vegas, and yet the characters are so repulsive, they're actually amusing.  I'm not sure if everything that happened in this movie is a satire or not.  It's so over-the-top in the performance and the so-called 'dancing' that the movie must've been one big joke, but everyone seems to take it so seriously, not to mention the rape scene.  It has flaws and it's mean-spirited, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't enjoying it a bit.  Maybe that's why this film is a camp classic.

B0034G4OWM|5.0|While the underlying topic is of course very serious (developers destroying a forest), this is a light hearted comedy about the critters striking back.  Expect a lot of 5-year old humor.  Your kids will love it.  As an adult, you have to grin and bear it a little since someone getting wacked in the crotch is funny one time at most. That said, there are scenes in here that cracked me up too, like the way the racoon communicates to the other animals.<br /><br />This movie had a great message and it's worth taking your kids to see it for that alone.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Jim Cameron has made a career of pushing the boundaries of movie making from the first Terminator, to Congo to Titanic to Independance day.  He set a new standard with Avatar.  The 3D version of the movie is nothing short of stunning, in the same league as the opening scenes of the first Star Wars movie (now number IV: A New Hope).  Even in 2D, the strength of the underlying story and production values come through.  The movie is visually stunning.  Scientists need to leave their critic lobe powered down when watching and if you're a film person, you will see many of the plot devices Cameron uses in previous movies reapplied here.  His message also gets a bit heavy handed in places as well, especially his anti-military bias.  Soldiers, don't take it personally..it's the martial methods as a valid policy option for eminent domain he's ranting about (something shared with Star Wars, though there were shades of a good vs evil conflect there as well.)  Cameron is a master storyteller and he pushes most peoples buttons with this story.  Bottom line: it's exciting, it's visually stunning, it's emotionally satisfying...a breakthrough movie everyone should own.

1582701709|1.0|Believing that your thoughts and frame of mind can alter reality is delusional, narcissistic, and immature. I would condemn this book for misleading people and wasting their time, but anyone who would believe that nonsense in the first place is already a lost cause anyway. For those people, I hope Santa is good to you this year.
030745455X|5.0|I generally ready romance and non-fiction books but thought I would explore outside my comfort zone. This was far out of my comfort zone but well written and a real page turner. The story has so many strings that tie the characters together, I can't imagine the beautiful mess that was in the authors head before committing it to pages.

B0034G4OU4|5.0|I read the book and was very inspired by her story.  She had courage and determination to do the \\"soul searching\\" we all have done at one time or another.  However, the way she went about it was an adventure that is almost unreal.  I am so proud of her.
B002ZG99G8|4.0|When a CIA black ops team are framed and left for dead by a mysterious guy named Max (Jason Patric), they come out of hiding and seek revenge. While a mysterious hottie (Zoe Saldana) claims she can help them get Max, but what are her true intentions and who's side is she really on.<br /><br />The movie occasionally silly with some goofy moments, especially in the end involving a plane and a motorcycle. Despite that though the film is always entertaining. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Watchmen, Supernatural seasons 1-2) probably would have made a better Hannibal than Liam Neeson in the upcoming A-Team movie and he shows why in the Losers by shining in a similar role.<br /><br />I also liked Chris Evans and I think he was surprisingly better here in a cocky and talkative role than he was in the Fantastic Four movies. He's more entertaining in the Losers than he was in those 2 movies as well. I still don't see him as Captain America though, due to that character being less cocky and goofy than anyone Evans has played. Jason Patric is also in good form as the nutty wisecracking villain.<br /><br />My only problem with the Losers is that should have ended the story with one movie. It's a good movie, but I don't see sequels happening, especially due to the not so great Box Office performance. But I recommend checking out the Losers since I enjoyed it more than the new Nightmare on Elm Street, hell even a little more than Iron Man 2. Just don't expect anything more than a fun movie that's occasionally pretty funny and sexy.
B003C1QIO6|4.0|Jack Johnson has been on the music scene for some time now, and while he's always had a consistent style, something that made his music truly identifiable, there was also a newness to each album he produced, whether in all songs or just a few tracks (for example \\"Belle\\" on In Between Dreams). To The Sea, his most recent album, certainly preserves the Jack Johnson sound, but the sense of novelty one may have gotten from his previous albums is not really there in this one... many tracks sound as though they could have been extras that never made it onto previous albums rather than fresh material, and there is a definitely slightly darker tone to this album over some others. This isn't to say the album isn't worth buying, in fact it has a great sound and a great flow track to track, and whether you are a long-time fan of his music or totally new to Jack Johnson there are songs you're sure to love. Just don't take this album as your only exposure to his music.
0061537969|3.0|I very much enjoyed this story, and thought the canine narration was well-executed and effective. It's well-written, well-paced, funny, and emotional. I grew to really care about the characters, and about seeing the central conflict resolved satisfactorily. I'm not at all a racing fan, and know next-to-nothing about it, but interpreted the sections devoted to racing as thought-provoking metaphors for \\"real life\\" and how to better react to the circumstances that get thrown our way. And as a Seattle native, I enjoyed reading a story set in the Pacific Northwest.    That said, there's too much Eastern mysticism / Zen spirituality / reincarnation in the themes for my taste. I was fine with this up to a point; after all, the narrator is a dog, and at first it seems he simply picked up these notions from watching television. But as the story progresses, the dog seems infused with his own mystical knowledge and speaks with the certainty of a Zen master.    Furthermore, what I found truly offensive is that the slutty 15 year old girl --- whose trampy behavior is key to the central conflict --- is said to attend Holy Names Academy, which is one of the most prestigious Catholic girls high schools in Seattle. Her school affiliation is given in a single throw-away line (p. 137), and is completely irrelevant to the plot. Why name the school at all, unless it's to take a cheap shot at the Catholic Church? And if it's to establish that the girl's parents have money, why not invent a ficticious school with a prestigious-sounding name? The cheap shot at Holy Names struck me as petty, and beneath what I'd expect from an author of Mr. Stein's caliber.
B00275EGWY|1.0|Usually success is a combination of talent, hard work and luck. Then again, a movie like this gets the Best Picture Oscar and one can only wonder: did the members of the Academy vote FOR this movie or against James Cameron? Sure, his arrogance did not make things easy; then again, one should not underestimate envy and spite as human motivation.<br /><br />Inaccuracies and obvious mistakes run rampant; the [[ASIN:B00004Y3NM Saving Private Ryan]] -wannabe camera shakes you into nausea; the plot line is abandoned in the sand again and again and (what is worse) there is absolutely nothing waiting at the end. No catharsis, no message, no moral, no closure. Nothing.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005AUJQ Platoon]] defined the Vietnam war not only with its realism and its ability to paint all the shades of moral ambiguity but also because because it had the guts to send a clear political message. In dire contrast, THE HURT LOCKER offers only a deafening silence on all these aspects.<br />The movie presents this war, with some of the sacrifices and atrocities it entails, as inevitable and expected. Keep enlisting, keep fighting and keep dying for the corporations and the banks - but don't you dare speak your opinion on the matter. Its message is a cowardly &#34;don't ask - and we are not going to tell you why either&#34;.<br />Because self-censorship is the worse kind of censorship, this is Hollywood at its worse.<br /><br />A spineless pseudo-documentary masquerading as an art movie. A cowardly film trying to capitalize on the stories of brave men thrown into unwinnable war.<br /><br />A film made by errand boys, sent by grocery clerks, to make sure the bill of blood is being paid in full. Again and again.<br /><br />Pass. With extreme prejudice.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|This movie is made for all of the SATC fans out there - so please, bear in mind that this is the targeted audience. The bad reviews all seem to come from people who have not followed the series and are mostly male reviwers, so I can understand they cannot relate to the characters. I don't really understand why they watched it then ! I just loved the sequel - much better even than the first one. It was fun from the beginning until the end - much funnier and less drama then the last one. If you love the series, you will love this film. Put on your best gear, have a cocktail and just go see it !     PS - I hope the girls will even make a film again if they are grannies - the SATC cast is just part of our lives and I wanna see them until the end !  xxx
B001UREJWM|5.0|Besides exploiting her husband, screwing ex-bandmates, ruining classic albums with dubious mixes and making a fool of herself in reality TV, Sharon Osbourne has spent the last 20 years or so trying to convince the world that Black Sabbath was relevant only during the Ozzy years, something that's not only completely false but really preposterous considering that ultimately, the real musical force behind the band was always Tony Iommi.<br />After Dio, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Vinnie Appice decided to reunite for the second time they chose to tour and record under the Heaven and Hell monicker, probably to avoid legal hassles with metal's favourite disgusting decrepit harpy.<br />Despite the name change, the band sounds exactly like it should: as prime second golden era Black Sabbath. But make no mistake, this is no nostalgia act cashing in on past glories. Unlike 1992's good but ultimately disjointed Dehumanizer, this is a band on fire, doing what they do best, that is, kick-ass traditional arena-worthy metal with stellar songwriting, musicianship and production. For an aging metalhead like me nothing is more comforting than seeing a truly classic band finally living up and even surpassing expectations, since songs like Bible Black, Atom and Evil, Fear and Follow the Tears wouldn't sound out of place within classic albums like Heaven and Hell or Mob Rules.<br />I was lucky enough to catch Heaven and Hell live last year on what sadly, turned out to be Dio's last tour, and was mistified on how strong, tight and lively the band sounded, no small feat considering that we're talking about more than two centuries of combined heavy metal history here.<br />So really, up yours, Sharon. Like it or not, this is Black Sabbath's sound in the 21st century, and the sad truth is that a reunion with Ozzy is out of the question simply because he's just not up to par vocally or musically, as the 90's embarrasing reunion concerts proved, and no name change or PR stunt can disguise this simple fact. As sad an untimely as Dio's death was, he will be remembered as the original metal god, who's last album was a fitting coda to a stellar career that spanned more than three decades. I can only hope that when he dies, Ozzy won't be remembered as the sad clownish joke he's become for the last 10 years or so, because he deserves much better.As sad an untimely as Dio's death was, he will be remembered as the original metal god, who's last album was a fitting coda to a stellar career that spanned more than three decades.

B00335EQ0E|5.0|The movie is as funny as I remembered, nd even better, since the image and the sound has been restored and remastered digitally, and it's amazing. The extras are very interesting, adn sometimes a bit boring when you check on the old documentaries, but seen with perspective, I think it's a great research work from the editors to release such a good edition. Pity that they haven't done the same here in Spain with the Spanish speial edition, only one disc edition and poor in extras.

1439190275|5.0|I have been a devout follower of a low-carb lifestyle for 10 years. I credit my diet with preventing a slow spiral into the abyss of my familial metabolic syndrom. I have read all of the Atkins books in the past, and basically created my own version of a low-carb plan. However, over the past winter, I was not feeling as good as I had for most of the past few years and was adding a bit of a \\"muffin-top\\" and \\"love-handles.\\" I took those symptoms as signs that I was eating something I shouldn't. When I saw the new Atkins book, I decided to buy it, even thought I figured I already knew the concept in and out. What I discovered, was that this new version finally made sense to me that the Atkins phases are in effect, an elimination diet, and that going through all of the phases would allow me to learn, much as people on elimination diets to determine allergies, how many grams of carbohydrates I can personally tolerate and in what form. The idea that glucose intolerance should be treated like gluten or lactose intolerance makes perfect sense. Two weeks ago I began at the induction level of Atkins for the first time. In 5 days, most of my little roll of fat had vanished. I intend to spend the next few months adding in carbs in small increments and determining which sources of carbohydrate I can consume and continue to feel as amazingly fabulous as I do right now.  I am a big fan of Steve Phinney because he has done studies on athletes, cyclists in particular, to see how they fare on a low-carb diet. I was told 4 years ago when I decided to take up cycling that there was \\"no way\\" I could manage a long-distance, multi-day ride without eating all the junk food they serve at the SAG stops. I quickly proved the scoffers wrong, and have indeed completed two 4-day, 250+ mile trips. I am currently training for my third. Two days ago, in the midst of my Atkins induction experiment, I rode 55 miles at a pretty fast pace. I felt so fabulous that I actually sprinted the last 5 miles. This was on less than 20 grams of carbs/day.   In closing, I must also disclose that I am 57, female, and my father and grandfather died of complications of \\"type II diabetes\\" and the quality of life they experienced in their later years was miserable. Grandpa died after an amputation and my father was nearly blind from retinopathy his last year.  I do not intend to suffer the same fate. The Atkins plan is my saviour.

B002ZG98VE|3.0|From my wife Sarah: Some of the comments made by those who are enthusiastic about this movie are accurate in my opinion. However it didn't add up to a good movie. Yes, I can see that it's probably an accurate depiction of that time in history, and Russel Crowe is an amazing actor. Yet the movie was slow as molasses, and the many story lines difficult to understand and follow. We were really excited about seeing this. The team of Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott (Gladiator) was intriguing. We found this movie very disappointing.<br /><br />I love historical drama. I have no difficulty following period movies. Usually when others around me don't get what's going on in any type of movie, I'm the one who understands and explains. Yet I was completely confused at times. Finally towards the end I got what was going on, but this made the movie frustrating and boring for me. My husband doesn't usually prefer period movies, but since it was the story of Robin Hood and he's a big fan of Russel Crowe, he wanted to see it. He was completely lost during much of the story, and in fact fell asleep. Just to give you an idea of who's writing this review so you can judge if what I'm saying has validity, we're both college grads with masters level courses.<br /><br />Russel Crow has a way of revealing so much from within as an actor that he's usually so compelling. It's easy to care about anyone he plays. However for some reason this was not the case in this movie. His character barely evoked any reaction. I suspect it wasn't his acting but the script, cutting and directing of the movie. Both Cate Blanchett and Russel Crowe have created passionate, big time chemistry relationships on screen. Yet the relationship between this Robin and Marion lacked chemistry. There was barely a match flame between them, which doesn't make for much an interesting romance story.<br /><br />Interestingly, the fight scenes were shot and cut much the same as in Gladiator, but the excitement and thrill just didn't match Gladiator.<br /><br />So if you really want to see this, my recommendation would be to rent it, but don't buy it or pay movie theater prices.r.

B001QXE0OC|1.0|This giving every no talent disney channel hack a record deal has to stop.  Poor, manufactured, polished, non-inspired, worthless trash, I wont even lower myself to call this music, because it's not.
B0021L8V1G|5.0|From my wife Sarah: I don't really get any of the reviews saying that this movie is boring or indulgent. From the start to the finish we were completely entertained. When the movie ended, the audience applauded, so I know we were not the only ones to feel this way.<br /><br />This movie has it all. Great action, fantastic special effects, well developed multi-faceted characters that you really care about, some romance, a well written script with depth and a great story, and outstanding acting.<br /><br />Once again, Robert Downey Jr. plays a brilliant but troubled (though evolving) man who's life has become devoted to protecting peace. At the same time he struggles with his personal demons, and in this sequel he grapples with a life threatening illness. This actor is amazingly natural, completely believable and very entertaining. I love that his character is so intelligent and must use his mind to work through everything. It's also fascinating to watch his character heal from the hurts and relationship issues in his life. This wasn't just some mindless superhero movie (not that those are bad, but this was just different and yes, maybe a little better). It was a layered, well done story.<br /><br />What an incredible supporting cast! Mickey Rourke was great as the villain. I can't put my finger on it, but he made the role fascinating as he did in the Wrestler. Gwyneth Paltrow was wonderful, beautiful and believable. I was really surprised by Scarlett Johansson. She's incredibly versitile. I don't want to give anything away by saying too much, but she was amazing. Don Cheadle brought sensitivity and strength to his role, and Sam Rockwell and Samual Jackson are always great.<br /><br />In conclusion - I strongly recommend this movie! It's totally worth the time and money.

B003CIG7AE|3.0|It is with some trepidation that I begin this review, knowing that I am pretty awful at writing music reviews.  That said, this review is from someone who has not had prior exposure to this band, does not know their earlier work, but who has a fairly extensive music library (roughly 1,000 lps and several hundred cds) after many years in alternative radio, which is where my title comes from.  I do not understand how this is alternative, except perhaps as an alternative to rap & variants.<br /><br />From the standpoint of ignorance (of their earlier work) I'd call it slick and overproduced, but that description would only hold if their earlier work were more raw or edgy.  I noted comparisons to Neil Young on their web site, but Young is a good deal edgier and a great deal more daring in the material he covers (i.e. the inspiration for his writing). Young, Springfield were transitional bands, blending folk, rock, country and the occasional touch of psychadelia.  This band does seem to get it's feel from Neil Young, but it is not an original sound, nor is it edgy or alternative in any sense of the word that I can think of.  I would call it polished (not necessarily a bad thing) easy-listening? folk-rock?<br /><br />Whatever they were before, this cd is clearly highly produced, inoffensive and slated for prime-time.  Sony & Columbia do not put out alternative, they just don't.  Expect this to pop up on adult contemporary stations around the country.  I don't think the band or cd is bad, I just don't think it is good.  They clearly have talent, and polish but to my mind are not original enough, saying or doing anything interesting enough to capture my attention or imagination.<br />They are inoffensive.  It is something I could play with either my parents or children in the room but I am not sure any of the 3 generations would be wowed by it.

B003C1QIO6|4.0|Sometimes in life you know exactly what to expect: Death, taxes and a chill CD from soul surfer, Jack Johnson. To The Sea opens with the instantly hummable You and Your Heart and ends gently like a spent wave returning to its source with Only The Ocean. The songs in between will calm your nerves like a freshening breeze at the beach.<br /><br />Critics complain about the lack of urgency or edge in Johnson's music. I say in a world where we are all rushing a hundred miles an hour to nowhere with our tech toys in tow, it's nice to strip away the BS and live in the moment.<br /><br />Haters say J.J's mellow vibe is an act. While I can't answer for Jack, I can say this: I've been a surfer (H20, not keyboard) most of my life and the joy is real; the good feelings lasting long after the final wave of the day... Jack Johnson has figured out a way to bottle this feeling and put it in a song. Only the biggest cynic could find fault in that.

0812973992|5.0|Colum McCann's 2009 National Book Award winner \\"Let The Great World Spin\\" has restored my faith in the ability of book award committees to pick a truly deserving winner with outstanding literary merit that's also accessible to the reading public. Far too often in recent years, we have had declared winners which have left many readers baffled at the judges' choice.      This ensemble novel of life in New York City in the mid-70s is a gorgeous piece of art and a thing of beauty because of its breathtaking sweep and bold ambition in portraying all of humanity's diversity especially its seamiest side at their most basic level and demonstrating how our response to situations we find ourselves in makes us all unlikely but no less real heroes in survival.    Just as the French funambulist Philippe Petit had left New Yorkers gaping in amazement at his mind blowing feat of traversing the World Trade Centre towers across thin air on a thin piece of wire, why shouldn't we be similarly awed by the more mundane but equally heroic struggles of a motley crew comprising an improbably idealistic liberation theologist, drug addicts and prostitutes on main street below? For haven't each of them been visited by miracles of another sort ? Like the priest in plainclothes finding himself playing Jesus to the down and out and also the love of a woman without guilt or compromise, or a pair of mother and daughter prostitutes who hold their heads up high playing parent figures to their children/grandchildren, or one among a group of commiserating mothers who lost her son in Vietnam but not the capacity to give and receive love?    Not all the stories happening simultaneously are given the full treatment. Some are merely hinted at or partially revealed. Yet each of them is firmly etched in our hearts and minds. That's how strong McCann's characterization is - the computer hackers feeding back on the Frenchman's hair raising feat, the unnamed secret night time photographer of subway graffitis,etc - they are walk on parts but utterly memorable and integral to the whole. I would have liked a little more elaboration of the judge's motivations though. These disparate strands interweave and finally resolve in a denouement that's both heartbreaking and life affirming.     You are unlikely to read anything better this year. This is modern literature at its best. Utterly compelling !

B001UV4XUQ|3.0|At times funny, at others trying too hard to be quirky - unsurprisingly, the cute but odd Zooey Deschanel stars - 500 Days of Summer takes a very long time to tell viewers what most know already: being in love is great, but being dumped is horrendous.  Love makes you skip down the street, imaginary marching band in tow, hi-fiving strangers as animated bluejays playfully tug at loose cowlicks.  Conversely, a lover scorned is a pitiful mess, incapable of rational thought or behavior, realizing egregious faults previously tolerated (like her enormous behind).  Making it worse is the habit of former lovers - primarily women - wishing to be friends after carving out hears with evil, scaly, soulless talons.<br /><br />Tom (Levitt) believes in love at first site, and when he meets Summer (Deschanel) his beliefs are confirmed.  While Tom is the typical person actively living a normal life, searching for love, Summer is an enigmatic free-spirit who readily admits that all she loves is the careless ability with which she can cut off her hair.  Naturally, the two become a couple, and Tom becomes much more emotionally involved than Summer.<br /><br />I appreciated the bold manner in which the cinematography was approached.  In more than one instance, unique styles were effectively used to convey a point or drive home a feeling.  The back-and-forth manner of storytelling, while normally forced and unnecessary, doesn't detract from the story much; in fact, it adds a dimension at times facilitates the tying of loose ends.  With an opening line of, \\"You should be warned, this is not a love story,\\" I'd say the film hits close to how real relationships and breakups occur - blindsided by a semi - and avoids the implausible formulaic traps in which most rom-coms get inextricably trapped.  The major problem with this film is that there are no repercussions for Summer's cold actions.  No lessons learned.  Tom may reap the benefits of being crushed, but there is no revelation for the female lead.  Not even Tom getting angry at her flippant behavior.  Somehow I doubt the same would hold true if the sexes were reversed.<br /><br />Nothing new here.  It's love is great, love sucks, wash, rinse, repeat.<br /><br />Jason Elineven Tom getting angry at her flippant behavior.  Somehow I doubt the same would hold true if the sexes were reversed.

B001AGXEAG|5.0|Of all the movies that Tim Burton did, there are three names that come out a lot during discussions. Of course his two Batmans, then his masterpiece Edward Scissorhands,  but most of all his excellent comedy Beetlejuice. Why's that? Because as a society where we usually consider the after-life as a dark and depressing world, Tim Burton presents death in a different perspective. He represents it as an extremely funny world where people become ghosts stuck in their own houses and are haunted by the living, a world where death is a huge bureaucracy, and a world where there are bio-exorcists, like the one and only Mr. Beetlejuice. Although this is a movie where the main characters are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, and they do an excellent job as a recently dead-couple, it's Michael Keaton who deserves the spotlight. For each time he appears on the screen, he just makes you laugh with his funny one-liners (excellent improvisation from Michael Keaton) and his perfect interactions with his co-stars such as Sylvia Sidney, Winona Ryder, Glenn Shaddix, Jeffrey Jones, and Catherine O`Hara, all future collaborators during Tim Burton`s career. Everyone, and I mean everyone, delivers a perfect performance.<br /><br />Not only that it is a movie that has excellent visual effects, both traditional and with the computer. Also, I loved how they were able to integrate gorgeous stop-motion animations during the movie. They were well integrated in the movie and are a proof that this kind of animation can really bring great possibilities to a movie, though there are certain limits to it of course. But hey, that also counts for CGI too.<br /><br />Finally, a great cheer to Danny Elfman, whose soundtrack really gave him the popularity and respect he deserved. A great idea from the makers of this DVD to integrate the soundtrack as a separate audio track.<br /><br />In the end, a great classic that should be listened over and over again and being considered a classic of modern american cinema.

B00005T30L|4.0|I developed a fondness for each of the characters and their strange quirks, and found the dark humor to be comically refreshing, off-beat and different. There were many moments where I could relate to the characters when I first watched this, ironically also around my senior year high school graduation. I would imagine every high school has their batch of stereotypical characters, and offbeat ones, and this delves into the offbeat perspective which was very refreshing for me.<br /><br />The pace of the movie is somewhat slow, which typically bothers me, but I was enjoying the movie \\"unwrapping\\" each character slowly, that it actually didn't bother me at all. The pace, dialogue and atmosphere of the movie is almost similar to that of a reality TV series, in the sense you feel you are really getting an exclusive peek into the lives of these individuals.<br /><br />The director was also able to wrap up the end of the movie in an interesting, thought-provoking way, which sealed my 4-star rating on this. My five-star ratings are saved for the ones that move me very deeply and are also cinematographically superior. In my opinion, this isn't big on the cinematography \\"artistic\\" aspect in the sense of being a visual feast of sorts, but the content is amusing and worthwhile to watch. Not your average comedy.

B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I became a Chuck addict after the first couple episodes of the first season. Chuck is well known for having relatable and loveable characters. This makes it almost too easy for the writers to not only keep us laughing, but at times to keep us on the edges of our seats.    I found Season 3 to be a little less playful than the first and second seasons, but that isn't a downside by any means. I enjoyed the direction the writers took the show. There were a couple elements of Seasons 1 and 2 that I found to be a bit repetitive that they changed in Season 3... and for the better I may add! I'll let you discover what those elements are for yourself!    This show continues to introduce situations that (relatively) we can all relate to in one way or another.    Terrific show. Terrific writing. Terrific cast. Great humor! Great plot! Great season!    Buy this season! You won't be dissapointed!
B003EYVXYG|4.0|Don't believe the hype! George Romero returns with his best film in the best part of 20 years, since the vastly neglected and underrated \\"The Dark Half\\". Though not on the same level of film making as \\"Night\\", \\"Dawn\\" or \\"Day\\", \\"Survival of the Dead\\" comes as a welcome return to form. After being disappointed by \\"Land\\" and \\"Diary\\", both rather dour, joyless affairs, I wasn't holding my breath for this one. But I was happily surprised. This is a fun film to watch, and it feels like Romero had a fun time, whatever the budget restrictions, making it. Much better acting, well-drawn characters, a thankfully better soundtrack, and a re-emergence of humour, along with a beautiful widescreen presentation, all add up to a triumphant furtherance of the only worthy zombie saga.
B0007XT87G|5.0|IMO Porcupine Tree released five exceptional albums and a great EP: Stupid Dream, Lightbulb Sun, In Absentia, Deadwing, Fear of a Blank Planet, and Nil Recurring.  The band made an average song sound great because of their musicianship, chemistry, and force of will.  Richard Barbieri fills space with lush electronic textures.  Colin Edwin's bass playing is tight and steady.  Gavin Harrison's unique style of drumming is crisp and timely.  With such a supporting cast, Steven Wilson produced a lot of great music.  Songs from Stupid Dream like Pure Narcotic, Slave Called Shiver, This Is No Rehearsal, and Baby Dream In Cellophane display the band's craftsmanship, beauty, and intensity.  The same may be said of songs such as Four Chords That Made a Million, Shesmovedon, Rest will Flow, and Hatesong on Lightbulb Sun.  However, their true ability to blend disquieting themes with marvelous melodies and rhythm came with In Absentia.  Songs like Blackest Eyes, Sound of Musak, The Creator Has A Mastertape, and Strip the Soul reflect the destructive longings of people addicted to what ails them.  As if fans couldn't get enough or could not hear the message, these themes were amplified on songs such as Anesthetize and the title track of the album Fear of a Blank Planet.  Like Pink Floyd on The Wall and Nirvana on Smells Like Teen Spirit, the message is you, the fan, keep coming back for catharsis because the world's problems seem insurmountable, and yet, every industry, including the industries that call attention to the dangers of conformity, are a part of the problem.  Among all of these albums it is hard to pick a favorite, but the one I listen to the most is Deadwing.  If you are reading this review, I hope you find your halo.
044024238X|4.0|What happens when a successful 29 year old female London lawyer, on the verge of being made a partner in a renowned law firm, makes what appears to be a critical error and through a series of incredible events finds herself masquerading as a housekeeper in the middle of the English countryside?  Can she acclimate to her new environment and pull off the charade?  Can this domestically challenged legal eagle who can't boil water and has never had to clean her own apartment become a Condon Bleu grade cook and gain intimate knowledge of the Hoover in the hall closet?  The answer to this and a plethora of other questions are addressed in Sophie Kinsellas THE UNDOMESTIC GODDESS.<br /><br />I was entertained for several hours on a long and boring drive by the audio version of Ms. Kinsellas novel.  Katherine Kellgren's delightful delivery of the story did a lot to enhance my listening pleasure.  With her hilarious interpretation Kelligan manages to convey the frenzied shenanigans of workaholic attorney Samantha Sweeting as she attempts to master the domestic arts and her portrayal of Samantha's employer Trish Geiger was a dead-on \\"Maggie Smith as lady of the house\\" portrayal and a real hoot to listen to.<br /><br />To really enjoy this book it is necessary to suspend your belief system, abjure reality and just enjoy this amusing, romantic romp through all of the improbable but entertaining situations experienced by Samantha as she discovers the pleasures of \\"A simple life\\". (sans Paris Hilton).  No great literature lurking here, just a fun few hours.
B002UXRGM0|1.0|The one-star rating is not for the BBC series 'Life' but because of how Amazon plays with the price for this Blu-Ray.  For weeks prior to its release, Amazon listed this DVD as $48.99.  On the day of its release, the Blu-Ray became $50.99.  Then two days later they lower the price by 50cents and the following day it becomes $59.99.  Then they put 'Life' as a Gold Box 'Deal' at $56.99 ~ simply aggravating..    I am sure 'Life' is excellent and worth getting but don't overpay-  if enough people hold off on getting it for the time being, maybe Amazon will lower it back to the $48.99 price for weeks before its release on 6/1.
0785134352|5.0|I'm a huge fan of jthm and other graphic novels, I'm not a huge fan of super heroes or the super hero stories. I really enjoyed the humor in this novel though and the originality it had. The artwork was amazing and the story was great. I saw the movie before I read the comic book but I have to say the book was a ton better! And I don't say that about a lot of books.. I'd recommend to anyone who likes super hero comics, gory comics and humorous comics because it contains it all! And it still manages to have a nice story line.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|This was an $8 2.5 hour YAWN!  Didn't expect it to be such a disappointment but it was.  Carrie, are you so vapid that in 2 years you have fallen out of love with Mr. Big over whom you obsessed for so long?  Charlotte, are you so self-centered that you can't doff the designers and don some sweatpants to take care of the children you cried for through 2 seasons?  Miranda, have you turned into a wimp who can't handle 1 bully at work?  Samantha, can't you think of anything intelligent to say so that we can respect you just a little?  Did you really have nothing to talk about but your hot flashes and being horny?  I'm your age, girlfriend, and I have lots more to talk about than that.  Where were the fashions from the 1st movie?  WHERE was the plot or story???  We lost Jennifer Hudson and got Liza doing an impersonation of Beyonce?  R U kidding?  Michael Patrick resurrected Buzby Berkley to stage the gay wedding???  Carrie REALLY had to call Mr. Big after 1 kiss with Aiden???  I'm not saying the girls can't be a little ditzy or stupid but are they stuck back in junior high?  If SATC 3 is going to be a re-run of people's crotches, please slap a warning label on the trailer.  As much as I enjoy humor and clever, adult humor, this was not it.  Last but not least (I'm only quitting because I'm getting tired re-living the movie):  I've never seen SO MANY sound booms in the shots!!!  Can everybody find the FIVE times that the sound boom dipped down into the shot???  Did I miss some (when I nodded off)?  The funniest moment I had in the theater the whole night (sad!!) was after 2 hours, I turned on my cell phone long enough to check the time and saw 4 other people doing exactly the same thing!  Sorry, LOVED the first one; watched it over and over.  Was bored to death with this one and hope to never even see another trailer of it on tv.  Don't give up Michael Patrick and team; just do better next time.
0312370849|4.0|Interesting story and well written.  The ending didn't do it justice.  It seemed like the author didn't know how to end the book and came up with an improbable scenario that didn't ring true (consensus of my book club).  Sheds light on a very dark period in French history that isn't talked about in the history books.
006621131X|5.0|This autobiography is remarkable for its lucid depiction of 50s/60s/70s living in the U.S. Romantic, nostalgic, and tender, this gift from one artist friend to another recounts the formative years of Smith and Mapplethorpe. Beautifully crafted prose that contains a poetic asymmetry in its internal structure; yet the narrative returns to the coda of Smith and Mapplethorpe's enduring friendship. When you have lived a life, famous or not, the details of that living are enormous. Blissfully, wisely, this telling is minus the kitchen sink.
B001EKP5FK|5.0|The Mirror Has Two Faces in one of my favorite light romantic comedies.  Streisand and Jeff Bridges are great together and the story line is just fun.  Prince of Tides was a tremendous book and surprisingly, a great movie.  And, of course, The Way We Were is a classic.  To have all three of these in one set at a good prices was too good to pass up!
0671449028|5.0|We read this book to our 3 month old each night and it gets her attention.  She loves looking at the animals and listening to the rhyme.  It's short and sweet.  The perfect length for a little one.  I find it hilarious that the animals get ready for bed, then they exercise!  Ha!  We read this along with Goodnight Moon each night and it is such a nice ending to the day.  Even if our daughter has been fussing she quiets down when we pull out this book.
B001HN694K|3.0|*spoilers!*<br /><br />Alice in Wonderland is not an easy story to make into a film. Basically it is a collection of weird encounters loosely strung together, lacking any real narrative thrust. Its success as a book lies entirely in Carroll's verbal wit and inventiveness, but such things do not translate easily to the big screen. Tim Burton has tried to counter this problem by devising a story line of his own: after 13 years Alice, running away from her engagement party, returns to Wonderland (or rather, as its inhabitants have it, Underland), where she is awaited as the one who will end the reign of the red queen. Themes from Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass and Jabberwocky are combined, with limited success it seems to me, to furnish this rather thin plot, that really doesn't bear stretching to the  nearly two hours that the film takes. The end, where Alice returns home, dumps her oaf of a fianc&eacute; and starts out on a career as an international entrepreneur, feels tacked on and unconvincing.<br /><br />The other remedy against lack of plot adopted by Burton is relentless visual spectacle. I don't think I've ever before seen a movie so utterly overdesigned. Three quarters in or so the eye becomes desperate for some repose, for just one scene that isn't burdened six layers deep with curly trees, wild skies, splashing waterfalls, scurrying fantasy-insects and colors to match. That is not to say that it isn't fascinating to watch; the design, Burton-style, is surreal and always interesting. It just is rather 'much of muchness'. You must also ask yourself if you want to get an image of the Jabberwock imprinted on your mind; in a lapse of inspiration Burton comes up with a rather conventional dragon, loosely based on Tenniel's illustration, although this one doesn't wear a waistcoat.<br /><br />Here, a little more humour would have helped. In general, this wonderland is pretty humourless, deranged rather than funny. There is, nonetheless, some comic relief. In the shape of Matt Lucas's Tweedledum and Tweedledee, for instance. And you can trust Tim Burton to make the good white queen even more ludicrous than her hotheaded (and bigheaded) sister. There are sudden touches of viciousness too, such as a combative dormouse with a nasty penchant for putting out eyes. Johnny Depp does another Willy Wonka and is getting a bit tiresome.<br /><br />Tim Burton remains an interesting director, but it seems that of late, despite all the panoply of CGI (or maybe because of it), he never quite reaches the heights of his earlier years, that brought us such brilliantly hilarious movies as Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks!, as well as the wonderful Nightmare before Christmas. Alice is definitely not in that league and while beautiful to watch, is surprisingly forgettable.ucas's Tweedledum and Tweedledee, for instance.

0756405890|4.0|I love fantasy fiction, and just finished this book. I must say it was very captivating.  It's much better than the Earthsea series, better than the Harry Potter series (although darker and not as fun), and almost as good as LOTR. The character development was excellent, the details were rich, and the treatment of magic had a very \\"realistic\\" feel to it--in that it's much harder to do magic than in the Earthsea or Harry Potter worlds.  I can't give it 5 stars, because LOTR would have that, and this is not LOTR.  But it was a good read, almost as hard to put down.    Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.    Can't wait for the rest of the trilogy.

We find ourselves popping in a random DVD from the series just to watch it when nothing good's on. It never gets old. The box set is nicely packaged and comes with extras that I don't care for. What I do care for is that the box keeps all the DVDs organized and in one central location. I highly recommend this box set.

I absolutely loved this book and wanted to thank those readers who took the time to publish a review. If it had not have been for those reviews I would never have known about this wonderful book. It captured me from the very first page and kept me hooked all the way to the end. I could not get the subject, story or characters out of my head.  I plan on passing this book along to anyone in my circle that is looking for a great read. So, thank you Amazon readers. I will definitely be back for more!
B002DKF47O|5.0|After seeing Behemoth perform part of Evangelion during the Metal Mayhem Fest '09, I had to go out and buy the album. What I got was exactly what I was hoping for; Death Metal so precise it borders on inhuman, and an extraordinarily creepy atmosphere.     Obviously the big standout on this album is Inferno, whose blast beats approach 250 BPM on the fastest songs. The guitarwork fits in very well; not the most technical but it serves to create a bleak atmosphere with an Eastern tinge, especially noticeable in the sitar outro of Shemhamforash, which is guaranteed to raise your hairs. Another feather in this album's cap is Nergal's voice, which is not so much a typical growl as it is a guttural bark, meaning your non-metal friends will be more inclined to run in terror rather than laugh when you turn on this album. Behemoth does many things right on this album, and if you're just testing the waters of Death Metal, this is a perfect place to start.

0670827592|5.0|My sister turned me on to the book when she was in college working on her education degree.  The first time I read the book I thought, what a great story.  I purchased the book when nephews, nieces, and Godchildren came into my life.  I always get \\"will you read that one more time\\". I do. I know children generally say \\"one more time\\".  But, when the visit they always ask if I will read the story about the real story of the threel little pigs.   I think the book is life at it's best.  We all see things differently and it is all in the wording and agenda(slow news day so they pick on the poor ole wolf)of others.  I purchased the book to give to my Uncle so he could read it to his grandson.  When I was little he gave me a Uncle Remus book and he would read over and over...I have never forgot the book or the times I know I rushed him to sit down and read to me.  There is nothing on this earth more precious than memories. Amazing the small things we remember and the love related to those memories.    Terrye

0679735909|5.0|I must admit that I did not initially like this book. The language is very dense and arcane, as well as somewhat foreign (to the American reader). It was more than a little frustrating to find so many unfamiliar words... but about 100 pages in, I was swept up by the spell! The richness and rhythm of the language are addictive. The poetry and letters interspersed throughout allow the reader to actively participate in the exploration (and add levity to the prose). There are so many layers to the story, as the modern characters reveal and reflect the realities of their historic counterparts. This is a dense and delicate tale, very rewarding for the patient and subtle reader.     I would add a plug for the movie, which I felt compelled to view, as a result of my enthusiasm for the book. It is good, and generally true, to the book. The historic depictions are beautiful and spot-on. Unfortunately, the modern day characters are miscast and awkward. So like Julie and Julia, it might have been a great film...

An ambigram is a piece of lettering which reads the same right side up and upside down, or in the actual and the mirror images.  I bought this in paperback, read it once, was essentially unimpressed, but kept it for the ambigrams \\"Angels and Demons\\" (front leaf and back cover), \\"Illuminati\\" (pp. 6 and 30), \\"Earth\\" (p. 277), \\"Air\\" (p. 303), \\"Fire\\" (p. 371), \\"Water\\" (p. 415) and one particularly masterful one which combined the words Earth, Air, Fire and Water ALL into a diamond-shaped ambigram which reads the same both right side up and upside down (p. 473).<br /><br />I have a book called \\"Inversions\\" (by Scott Kim), which features this type of fascinating artwork.  I also have a picture book of tattoos, \\"Body Type\\" (by Ina Saltz), which includes some designed by John Langdon, among others.  As an illustrator and calligrapher I am always enthralled by creative usages of letter forms.  John Langdon's ambigram artwork is the very best thing about the book \\"Angels and Demons,\\" and it is very good indeed.
B00005MP58|1.0|Worst production of Pride and Prejudice ever. The screenplay was obviously written by a man, and one who did not comprehend the source material. Sexed up for American TV, it loses all the charm of the manners and morals play of the novel. Almost a pastiche, all the characters are caricatures. Eahles face pulling and continuous eyebrow raising are a distraction from the story as well as her overblown sighing and bosom heaving. Don't bother with this version of the movie. Reread the novel or go for the '70s version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul.

But with \\"Congratulations\\", this is an entirely different matter. The CD screams \\"British psychedelia\\" and \\"experimentation\\" from beginning to end. With a definitely 2010 twist. Tracks like the 12 mins plus \\"Siberian Breaks\\" and \\"Brian Eno\\" are worth buying the album alone. Seems like the lads have come up with what they really had in mind after all.

1440425922|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

1439169438|4.0|Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.<br /><br />As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.<br /><br />And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).<br /><br />Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.<br /><br />And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late.

1592332803|5.0|This book was given to me as a gift. While I was not new to vegan baking, I have had issues with textures, flavors, etc. This book taught me that it not me but the awful recipes I had been using that had been at fault.     I have made several recipes from this book and have been satisfied with every one of them. Two things I really appreciate about the book are the flexibility in vegan substitutes for each recipe and the detailed information available on how to select the best ingredients. And as with most vegan cooking, the opportunity is available for more healthful versions of usually sinful sweets.    I highly recommend this book.
B001PUBLF2|5.0|I've been a casual fan of Europe sice THE FINAL COUNTDOWN, but this is only the second cd I've bought of theirs. After previewing it on Amazon I loved the sound quality of this recording. Plus they cover songs by Pink Floyd UFO and Thin Lizzy which I'm a sucker for. All in all a great cd.
1401308201|5.0|I have only recently become a Wicked fan, having seen the show twice in the last few months in San Francisco. It is, without a doubt, one of the best musicals I've ever seen. The Grimmerie is a beautiful, informative book and something all Wicked fans will cherish. If there is a Wicked fan in your life, this would make a perfect gift.
B0034KZE2W|1.0|Very poor service, CANT GUARANTEE SIZE FITMENTS!!!! I followed the web site instruction for size ordering, but the shoe doesn't fit. And because of the sellers poor business ethic I have to pay for the exchanging the shoes. THEY DO NOT WANT TO HELP YOU OUT, THEY DON'T CARE FOR YOUR BUSINESS. I personally think that a size 10 should a size 10 no matter who sells the shoe.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I did some pilates for awhile but it bored the heck out of me and I wasn't really getting the results I wanted so decided to try this one because it got such good reviews and I really like Jillian Michaels.  I'm still on level one and probably will be for awhile but I really like it a lot. I started feeling the results right away and her attitude is very motivational.  When I start getting tired and want to stop... she's right there in my face pushing me to the end. It's like having my own personal trainer right in my living room and I couldn't think of anyone else I'd want training me but her!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie was awesome. The graphics and stunts were incredible. The story line was a familiar one in terms of people with power attempting to take what they want from those with less power. This one did add a twist by bringing in the spiritual realm as a force to aid those without the power. It is a must see!!!
0060899220|5.0|Speaking as one of those uninformed, ignorant and uncaring customers who can't tell the difference between French cuisine and a Leggo waffle, the book was very informative, amusing and entertaining. Back in the 1970s, when I was a teenager, watching the assembly line cooking done at our local McDonald's, it looked like very hard work. I couldn't imagine the pressure cooks were under at finer dining establishments which had a larger variety of menu items for the customer to choose. Now I know. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Mr. Bourdain's blunt delivery was not intended to make readers paranoid about eating out, but it sure had that effect on me. To work in such a helter-skelter, crude environment takes a unique kind of individual. The book is a mixture of the crass and the poetic. Clearly the guy loves food and waxes a little too much, for my tastes, about dishes which went completely over my head. Mr. Bourdain's memoir about his first interest in food and his subsequent immersion into professional cooking is a real eye-opener. If you are easily upset by profanity or cringe-worthy anecdotes, this book will give your heart serious conniptions. It's worth it.

1401207529|4.0|I'm changing my initial review to 4 stars...  Here's what I initially wrote... I'm 52 and grew up with the great silver age classics.  I used to read Fantastic Four, The Amazing Spider-man and the other outstanding Marvel comics.  I loved the stories and the artwork and the way the layout was organized.  When Watchmen came out I read a review of the book and figured I'd give it a try.  I enjoyed it.  Since then I've been looking for something similar but have been disappointed with most of the new stuff.  This one was ok but the artwork isn't as good as the classic style and the story wasn't great either.  If you want good comics pick up some of the editions of Marvel Masterworks...
B003ELOQD4|1.0|U2 must of had in their contract with Live Nation that they could release this on DVD because it feels rushed.   As others have commented, the show does not look like it's in high-def, the rapid camera changes are very annoying, and the whole spaceship thing is just plain silly.    The other gripe I have is with U2.  First,  I absolutely love U2 and have seen them at least 10 times on various tours.  What was so great about U2 for many of was the spontaneity of the group.  You never knew what Bono was going to do and it was not uncommon for a five minute song to turn into a fifteen minute jam with Bono singing from the heart.      I'm afraid that my favorite group is becoming more predictable.  What I mean is that every show on this tour was pretty much the same.  Hopefully U2 will return to that dangerous edge where you never knew if you were about to experience something truly special.    And hopefully they will never let this editor touch one of their DVD's again.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|I'll admit that when I 1st saw QoS I felt a bit let down. I, like many other people who were wowed in 2006, was very much expecting Casino Royale Pt 2. However, in subsequent viewings, I started to realize why this film was much darker and more minimalist: Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson, having made every attempt to re-envision the film series with CR, were trying at the same time to re-envision the character the way Ian Fleming originally wrote him. This movie continues and solidifies that effort: Bond is meant to be a cold-blooded killer bent on solving Vesper's involvement with a criminal organization.    Yes, the film does have it's slow areas and the story is a bit hard to follow at first and it certainly does NOT equal CR for excitement. However, I've found that the more I watch it, the more I appreciate it, especially in the grand scheme of the series. For decades the series had been too sensationalized, too gimmicky, even too cheery (Bond ALWAYS got the girl) and it needed to stop, BADLY. Die Another Day was the proverbial final straw & Broccoli & Wilson knew they needed to start over. I'd ask everyone out there who slags this film to give it a few more chances, watch it a few more times & think about the ultimate overarching theme: they're developing a character here, not trying to revert back to the grandiose style the series had been trapped within.
B000X107GI|5.0|This was a good way to purchase batteries (the stores usually only sell in packs of 1 or 2).  The shipment was prompt and the price was fair.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|There was a reason this film was made: Barb Broccoli & Michael Wilson knew that Die Another Day was the final straw for the series becoming too gimmicky & grandiose. The series had become too reliant on gadgetry, visual FX, and especially sex and it needed to stop. Perhaps worst of all, the character had become too much of an international, womanizing playboy, too jovial for what Ian Fleming had originally thought the character should be.     Bond is therefore forced to rely more on his military training, his intelligence, investigative skills and his wits to complete his mission. He also has to rely on his competitive edge, especially during the lengthy poker match. Instead of relying on the legendary ability of the character to win in the end, Bond really has to work for his victory. That alone makes this film worth repeated viewings.     Plus, there's still tons of incredible stunts, explosions, bullets, and Bond killing anyone who gets in his way. And just for the record, I believe, without a doubt, that this film has the absolute BEST finale of the entire series!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|One of the best movies to come along in years.  Can't wait for the sequel to come out.
0066620996|5.0|The book \\"Good to Great\\" can be summarized as a research project conducted by a team of 21 individuals over five years with the motivation of uncovering a transformation that takes a company from the scale of mediocrity, to that of greatness.  While the main objective of their findings applies towards a fortune 500 company, many of the concepts described can be applied to almost every aspect of daily life and to almost any individual.    Some of the concepts that really stand out in the text pertain to leadership qualities, discipline, company culture, and choosing the right people for the company.  The book coins several terms such as \\"Level 5 leadership\\" and \\"The Hedgehog Concept.\\"  In an effort to describe the basics of these concepts without diluting their meaning, a \\"Level 5 Leader\\" is a person that is characterized by having a paradoxical mix of rigor and determination to lead an organization without letting the temptation of arrogance creep into their portfolio.  The \\"Hedgehog Concept\\" can be thought of as one of the central engines that each of the Good to Great companies constantly referred to when making the crucial decisions needed to make the transformation to greatness. In a sense, the Hedgehog concept was an understanding by the company of what they could be the best at.     The most fascinating aspect of this book really lies in the fact that all of these concepts and ideas formulated by the author and his team were developed not out of opinion, but from empirical data and endless interviews and structured research methods.  Any individual from a college student to a CEO of a large organization will no doubt find value in the findings of this book whether it be to improve ones own life, or take a sneek peek into the workings of what it takes to bring a company to the stature of greatness.
031606792X|1.0|SPOLIER ALERT!<br /><br />I liked the first three novels--a lot!--read three of them in two days. Couldn't put them down. This one, however, was slow, daunting, and just weird. I don't think she stayed true to the characters, and I think the plot was flimsy and the ending was cruely anticlimatic.<br /><br />I don't like Bella when she turns vampire. There's nothing for the readers to relate to--suddenly, Bella is completely perfect in every way. She's more powerful, stronger, faster, etc., then everyone else, even though she's a brand-new vampire. She doesn't suffer over anything. It was as if the author wanted her to have a happy ending and overkilled it by ensuring that Bella makes no sacrifices whatsoever, and sacrifices and faults is what helps make a character more human (Bella's daughter, btw--is the same way. Perfect in every way, but of course).<br /><br />Edward, once Bella is more powerful than him, also becomes very 'blah', if you can imagine, and I swear Jacob's maturity drops to a ten-year-old level, and being inside of his head for 1/3 the novel was torurous.<br /><br />I hate to say this, but it reads like a bad fan-fiction. Like it wasn't Stephanie Meyer who wrote it--it's caliber is just so far below her other stories, and it seems like this was just rushed out and that she either didn't enjoy writing it, or she enjoyed it too much, because her characters like to talk a lot about stuff that makes no baring to the actual problems at hand, and explaining a lot of stuff that really doesn't need to be explained.<br /><br /> I mean, if you like reading about vampire tea-parties, this book is for you. Because even though it took nigh 700 pages to reach an elevated plot line, the end just fizzles out. No actual fights at the end, no deaths, nothing new. Nothing exciting. They'll live boringly ever after. It's like a bomb went off in my imagination.
B000002OX7|5.0|Who's Next<br /><br />The first four bars of this album (from the song \\"Baba O'Riely\\" )put The Who light years away from every other rock band on the radio at the time. Someone had finally got the synthesizer right and raised it from an annoying experiment to a true rock instrument.<br />This album ended the era of cheesy syth sounds (at least until the '80's) and sent everyone back to the drawing board.<br /><br />And it still sounds fresh today.

B00005QGAT|5.0|I bought this for my mom who is a huge MJ fan as I assume many of you are and she loved it. There isn't much I can say that will convinve you to like or dislike the music but as a collector of MJ's music I can say that one would be far better served purchasing the main albums rather then compilations(unless you buy the fancy 8 disc ultimate collection). The reason for this is that you will not get as many repeats of popular songs and get to listen to the growth of MJ as a creative genious. Some of the bonus tracks are cool to listen too as well as they are typically demo tracks of MJ recording the music at his house with his family playing various instruments and allow you to see how the song initially started and how the studio helped MJ form that vision into popular songs of today. Bottom line this should be in every MJ collection.
0743298039|5.0|I actually listened to this book on a book tape during a recent road trip and fell in love with it. The story is compelling - I sat in the driveway, listening, to discover what would happen next rather than go in the house to see my family! Plus the language of the book is absolutely beautiful. It's so refreshing to have a good story combined with such beautiful language.
B002VECM4A|4.0|This is one of the most powerful and memorable movies I've seen in a while. Though there is an overabundance of swearing, and there are some scenes that are difficult to watch, in the end I thought these aspects of the film made it even more realistic, and made the main character that much more likable. One of the things I particularly liked is that it isn't a cliched story with one-dimensional \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" characters. \\"Precious\\" Jones and her mother evoke a variety of emotions ranging from disgust and hatred, to pity, to compassion.    The soundtrack really suits the story as well (as we see in the song, \\"Happy\\" featured in the trailer). I really enjoyed it.    I know some reviewers have called the movie racist and exploitative, but I found Prescious's desire to overcome her circumstances inspirational. Abuse happens to children of every ethnicity and economic status, and abuse movies have centered on characters from pretty much every ethnicity and status (remember \\"Mommy Dearest? How about \\"Radio Flyer\\" or \\"Stand by Me?\\").     The quote in the movie's credits which reads, \\"To precious girls everywhere,\\" sounds to me like the author meant for her work to reach every abused or struggling child. I don't really think it's fair to call the film racist or exploitative simply because the abuser  is African American.     Though you may find the story a little hard to take, I think most people will appreciate this film in the end.

Green's masterpiece beautifully combines mystery, adventure, and plenty of teen humor.     Since he was a child, Quentin Jacobsen (also known as Q) has loved his next door neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman. In fact, he believes living next door to her is his one miracle in life. Thus, it is not a surprise when Margo knocks on Quentin's bedroom window late one night and easily persuades him to join her on a night full of slightly illegal adventures.

1400067936|4.0|Three years before \\"The Black Swan,\\" Taleb published this book as a relative unknown, and the tone he takes is remarkably different from the one in \\"Swan.\\" Both books cover pretty much the same territory, although \\"Black Swan\\" puts many more \\"memes\\" out there (\\"Mediocristan,\\" etc.). But what is interesting in \\"Randomness\\" is Taleb's relative degree of humility, and his focus on understanding his own weaknesses in order to understand others,' and (possibly) profit from them. He describes how he learned to accept and deal with the fact that we are not rational except in a limited way. He identifies the \\"rational actor\\" as a normative construct in the mind of economists and their models, with little connection to reality (the best line of the book is his statement that \\"Normative economics is like religion without the aesthetics\\" (p. 189)). The \\"epiphany\\" Taleb says he had is the recognition that \\"our brains are made for fitness, not for truth\\" (p. 197), and that the emotions pouring out of his \\"fit\\" brain are actually necessary:  they allow him to make decisions and give him the energy to execute them.  Trying to become the economists' notional \\"rational man\\" and eliminate emotion, therefore, is not only unworkable, it's undesirable (p. 222). Without our emotions and the irrationality that flows out of our emotional responses, it would take us \\"an eternity to reach the smallest conclusion or perform the smallest act\\" (p. 187); we would be \\"incapable of making the simplest decision\\" (p. 202).  It is our emotions that \\"prevent us from temporizing\\" (p. 202). In fact, he says, those people who actually are purely rational turn out to be brain-damaged: they have \\"a defect in the amygdala\\" (p. 240).      In order to counteract our inherent biases created by an \\"unintelligent\\" set of genes (p. 222), biases that are natural and even desired consequences of the integration of our emotional and rational brain systems, we should be ferreting out the biases and holding them up tothe light, and then once they are identified \\"we need to accept the fact that we are mere animals in need of lower forms of tricks\\" to deal with them (p. 233). Among the biases are the fact that our brain relies on \\"quick and dirty heuristics\\" -- shortcuts -- to solve problems, which have the side effect of creating biases (p. 188). One bias is to be emotionally affected more by losses than by gains (and thus to irrationally avoid large numbers of small losses even when they are likely to lead to larger offsetting gains); another is to recognize differences among things better than we do absolutes, and to allow our perceptions of facts and conclusions to be skewed by anchor or surrounding \\"facts\\" that are really irrelevant (p. 193).  Further, \\"we are not made to view things as independent from each other\\" but instead we are biased to \\"immediately [] establish a causal link\\" between two things that may well be unrelated (p. 230), and to \\"favor the narrated\\" (p. 262).  Because of this genetically determined bias in favor of causality, \\"it is emotionally harder to reject a hypothesis than to accept it\\" (p. 230).  Our task as thinking human beings he says, is to recognize that we are genetically programmed \\"to be fooled,\\" and that we therefore have to stay on our guard (p. 218). Taleb, the thinking man, describes with pride how he \\"start[s] every meeting by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it\\" (p. 243).  He has also cut himself off  from the distracting cultural \\"noise\\" by watching TV only with the sound off, by reading only analysis (\\"The New Yorker\\") and no daily reporting (\\"The Wall Street Journal\\"), and, apparently, at least prior to publication of this book, by spending a lot of time by himself. All of this is very true, and very admirable.  The tone in \\"Black Swan\\" is quite different, and it appears that Taleb may have failed to heed his own maximin \\"Randomness\\" that \\"[t]oo much success is the enemy\\" (p. 181).

0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins' Good to Great doesn't just tell you how companies go from good to great, but he provides the reader with hard evidence that opens up thought provoking discussion that ultimately leaves the final conclusions up to them. Much of this study was compiled from company history, stock share information, and interviews with actual executives. We are presented with comparisons of great companies and their comparable counterparts, from which we can pick apart their differences of what ultimately allowed one company to dominate in their respective field. The key events of history and the breakdown of trends across the great companies led to Collins and his team to generalize the leadership and cultures of each company that makes them great. These key points learned from great companies are applicable for any company and were highly insightful as well. I felt this was an easy to follow study and highly recommend reading it no matter what industry you are working in.    I felt that Collins organized his study very well which was especially helpful in comparing such a wide range of great companies from different industries. I felt this was key in what makes this book appealing to people of any industry because we learn from each one. Collins presents his study of great companies from their buildup to breakthrough so we can really see what allowed them to break free from average which is where most companies are left behind. He then defines three areas which are disciplined people, disciplined thought and disciplined action, all which contribute in defining the culture of a company. It is this culture of the company that sets them apart from the average and allows them to be great and that culture is what Collins breaks down and presents to us. Each chapter essentially covers a different area that falls within these categories but he does a great job of tying it all together.     Some of the main points we get from this study are the characteristics of great leadership, also known as level 5 leadership, how companies should stick to a hedgehog concept or do what they can be best at and care about most, the discipline thoughts and use of technology to act in ways that help achieve their hedgehog concept, and how great companies face brutal facts and know what they are actually capable of. All these components were related to each other in a very integrative way which is what added to the simplicity of this book. It really creates a new philosophy about running a business in terms of the culture of the company defined here.

I was very looking forward to watch this having heard such nice things about this. Sir David Attenborough is amazing as always. I must admit LIFE is some of the best camera-graphy I have every seen, I was speachless after watching the 1st disc itself with very amazing pictures. I watched the 1st dics thrice before moving on to the 2nd dics.   The division of chapters is perfect, the movie looks like it was tailor made for High Def.

B0009A40ES|5.0|Christian Bale. Words can't describe him OR the movie. American Psycho is a cult movie. You will want to watch it several times. Each time you will pick up subtle humor along with enough high tech murder to satisfy all cravings. Think about it when you order your next business cards.
B00260HH3K|5.0|I rented this movie for $1, assuming it was going to be crap-tastic... and was actually pleasantly surprised!  Within the first few minutes they made it perfectly clear how the tone and style for DBE was going to go.  At first you think it's going to be a serious movie about Goku training and becoming a man etc., then the wirefighting and ridiculousness break out and you can tell immediately that it's going to be a silly, fun adventure movie.  Not a straight-up comedy by any stretch... think about the same level/tone as Sky High meets Mortal Kombat and you'll be pretty close.  Props to Chow Yun Fat as the dirty, old Master Roshi!  I loved it so much I'm probably going to go out and buy it later :)    As for all those die-hard DB fans out there that are griping about the movie being different from the series... I actually considered this movie to be a fairly good 90-min representation of DB/early DBZ.  There were some plot holes/explanations-left-unanswered/etc., but it was certainly a fun movie that kept true to the basics.  Just don't expect that you're buying a super-serious, $100million remake of the DB series.

It is very good, and I'll definitely make my friends listen to it every time they come over my house.
B001SGEUNI|3.0|how highly rated this album is.  I'm not trying to be a jerk or a troll, but this album (in my opinion) is no where near a 5 star album.  I'm not going to lie, I'm a big fan of female fronted metal/rock bands, but this album just didn't do anything for me.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a bad album.... it's just an average album.  With the high ratings I went into it expecting more.  The band plays hard rock (attitude-rock).  The band musically is talented.  Nothing extraordinary, but talented.  The vocals (which may be the biggest draw) are good, and for the most part go with the music.  To me the weakest part of the CD is the lyrics.  To me they are just to generic.  The lyrics are mostly about relationships and have sexual overtones.  Which seems to be a must for any attractive female rock singer.  There seems to be several songs about her  \\"not being the one\\".     I guess the lyrics and music are supposed to be fun, with a drink a beer rock n roll feel to it, but I'm not that into that.  Another thing I just can't shake is that this CD has a very purposely commercial feel to it.  Maybe even a little bit formulaic and compromised.  This in the end to me is a 3-star album.  I will be open to giving their next album a listen, but this album has not made me a fan.    Notable tracks:  What Were You Expecting, Better Sorry Than Safe, Nothing To Do With Love

0553582038|4.0|As most people reading this review are probably aware, there is a lot of controversy surrounding this book.  While the first three volumes of Martin's saga are almost universally praised, this latest (ha! Latest, and released now five years ago) volume is treated as Martin's bastard child, many wishing it had never existed, or that it had more of what they wanted, or wishing they had never read the series to begin with.  It's easy to understand where this frustration comes from.  For one thing, the direction of the story completely veers off, and the cast of characters is radically different.  If one had picked up the story without expecting that, I could see how it would be frustrating.  Compound that with the fact that Martin said he would give us the rest of the story FOUR YEARS AGO, and still hasn't, and it's easy to see why many fans would be frustrated.  But the reality is that both of these circumstances are tangential, they have nothing to do with the merits of this book.  And when I try to be objective, I find the plot and the characters still interesting and worthy of acclaim.    Having said that though, I would still say this is the worst of the four books in the series.  This isn't a criticism of the book itself, but more of a realistic recognition of what it is and where it is.  It's often looked on as a continuation of the first three, but I think it is more properly considered as the epilogue to the first three book series, and the introduction to whatever is coming now.  Storm of Swords was the best of the series so far, but that's because it was climactic, and climax is riveting.  Many of the conflicts introduced in the early series were resolved in that volume, and new ones were only just set up for Feast for Crows.  As such, FfC is an introductory volume, and is best compared to Game of Thrones, to which it is only slightly inferior.    Many of the storylines of Feast for Crows are interesting and compelling.  Of foremost interest to me is Sansa and Littlefinger, the latter of which has revealed himself to be a true master schemer, who now is a great source of anticipation, and will doubtlessly be a majorly interesting plot mover.  Samwell Tarly and Arya Stark are also characters whose circumstances have changed, and whose stories are of great interest.  And most importantly, there are two new storylines which I find fascinating, about settings with rich backgrounds, which so far in the series we've heard little about.  These are Dorne and the Iron Islands.  Dorne is especially enchanting.    The primary character of the book, though, is Cersei Lannister.  That Martin made her such a central figure in this volume is a real break with the earlier series, in that she's the first point of view character to be eminently loatheable.  All of the other point of view characters have been loveable, likeable, or at the very least, sympathetic.  When Martin made Jaime a POV character in Storm of Swords, I was skeptical for the same reason, but he made Jaime a great character, and he grows even more in this volume.  He's now one of my favorites.  But Cersei is none of that.  She may be Jaime's twin, but of course, they're not identical.  I hated her with every word I read of her.  She's pure evil.  The only way to enjoy her story was to hope that she eventually would destroy herself, and it would be oh so sweet.  In that vein, it's enjoyable.    Having said all that praise, though, there are points of the book that are less satisfying.  There are characters who carry on pointless, rambling quests with no satisfying end.  There are intriguing introductory scenes that are not stoked into interesting plot points.  The prologue comes to mind in that regard.  But these negatives don't render the book deserving of all the maligns it has received.    One last word about the whole Martin situation, to anybody who's interested in the my opinion.  I say be patient with Martin.  This has been a great series.  The only unforgiveable sin would be for him to publish A Dance With Dragons, and it not to live up to the series.  That would be terrible.  Think of Harry Potter, an inferior literary series, but still an epic.  The first volumes, were good, but in the end, it was clear that the product suffered for the sake of the deadline.  The result?  That series won't stand the test of time as well as if they were written to perfection and it had taken longer.  Think of Tolkien.  To his credit, he published The Return of the King within a year of The Two Towers, and it was great.  But ponder two hypotheticals.  What if he had published it in that timeframe, and it was lackluster?  What if he had published what he had, but 5 years later?  Which would be worse?  That was now 55 years ago, and while a delay may have annoyed his fans at the time, it would now be just a footnote to the literary historian.  His legacy would be the books, and they would be just as great, just as Martin's will be.  So take as much time as you need George, just so long as your next volumes are as great as your first four.  We'll be waiting.

1597801577|4.0|In the not-too-distant future, the Kingdom of Thailand fights a lonely battle against ecological disaster. 'White-shirts' from the Environmental Ministry burn out disease while maintaining a seed bank that allows them to develop crops resistant to the programmed blights and diseases unleashed by the 'calorie companies' which have monopolized food creation in most of the world, but which have also often lost the race against their own plant viruses, losing whole families of food crops.<br /><br />Authro Paolo Bacigalupi adopts the modern SF approach of flipping among multiple point of view characters, an executive/spy for an American calorie company, a 'yellow card' Chinese immigrant, a captain of the white shirts, the windup girl the novel is named after, and the captain's lieutenant. All (except maybe the white-shirt captain) pursue their own agendas without much regard for the potential impact on Thailand and the ecological disaster that's overtaken the world.<br /><br />The use of multiple point of view characters, most of whom are unsympathetic, distances the reader from the story...which might be a good thing considering how dark Bacigalupi's tale becomes. Destroying is always easier than creating and in Bacigalupi's universe, it's as easy for a hacker to introduce new viruses as it is for today's hackers to unleash another computer virus. Bacigalupi plays with technology. Springs, powered by human energy or power stored from mutated elephants, run vehicles, weapons, even airships although it's hard to imagine a world where storing of mechanical energy is efficient. Still, I love Bacigalupi's extrapolations of a post-petroleum contraction, to corporations chasing profit at any cost in a world where it's easier to create markets by destroying native foodstuffs than to create better product, and where twenty-first century skyscrapers are the ultimate slums once energy is not available to drive elevators and air conditioners.<br /><br />THE WINDUP GIRL tool a long time to get started. Several times in the first two hundred pages, I set the book down (reading a couple of other books between when I started and when I finished it). The lack of sympathetic characters distanced me from the story despite the intriguing universe and solid environmental message. Ultimately I stuck with this story and found it to be overall enjoyable.veral times in the first two hundred pages, I set the book down (reading a couple of other books between when I started and when I finished it).

B000NIVJHM|3.0|&#34;Dirty Dancing&#34; was the hit romantic drama of 1987. The two main cast members are a highlight. Patrick Swayze is in his prime and Jennifer Grey is cute & nimble, like a fawn. In reality Grey was 26 years-old during filming, although she passes for late teens pretty well. Swayze, however, was 34 and looks it, albeit fit and trim.<br /><br />THE PLOT: Patrick plays Johnny Castle, a working-class dance instructor at a mountain resort in the Catskills in 1963. Grey plays &#34;Baby,&#34; a 17-year-old daughter of an affluent Jewish doctor vacationing at the resort. She takes the place of Johnny's dance partner after his partner gets pregnant, albeit not by Johnny. Baby naturally develops a crush.<br /><br />The story keeps your attention but you'll roll your eyes at the idiotic misunderstanding where Baby's father assumes Johnny's the one who got his partner pregnant and, for some strange reason, no one sets him straight. Not to mention, the characters always say the wrong thing at the wrong time, which perpetuates the misunderstanding. Also, the sexual union of Johnny & Baby is both premature and unbelievable in light of the time period, Baby's age (17 years-old) and her upbringing. Frankie Avalon was once asked about his early 60s &#34;Beach&#34; movies if the male-female relationships were as &#34;squeaky clean&#34; as portrayed and he answered (paraphrasing): &#34;As a teen back then 'going all the way' wasn't even considered an option.&#34; The obvious exception would be disreputable kids from the &#34;other side of the tracks.&#34;<br /><br />Moreover, the fact that Johnny is having sex with the doctor's daughter, a minor at that, can't win any points in his favor. Hence, even without the misunderstanding there's little reason for the father to warm up to Johnny. So why does the doctor show respect for Johnny at the end -- a dude who's fornicating with his daughter and is clearly much older than her as well (at least five years). Such blatant flaws smack of lazy writing and are offensive to anyone with an ounce of intelligence.<br /><br />If you can ignore these stoo-pid elements, however, the film is entertaining. The dance sequences shown in the staff area are akin to vertical sex with clothes on. I guess that's why it's called &#34;Dirty Dancing,&#34; huh? Yet this is another flaw of the movie -- these dance sequences are so amped-up and choreographed it shouts to the viewer via megaphone: &#34;This is A MOVIE; it's NOT REAL.&#34; Nonetheless, Grey's a cutie, Swayze's The Man (like, say, Elvis) and the lush Appalachian locations are outstanding (filmed at Mountain Lake Resort, Pembroke, Virginia, and Lake Lure, NC).<br /><br />The film runs 105 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: C+ve to anyone with an ounce of intelligence.

B001EN71DQ|5.0|I've always liked Star Wars; it may seem too juvenile for some hard core Sci Fi fans, but to me it's nice to have the classic battle between good and evil that most people can understand, relax, and enjoy. The extra scenes enhance the movie. It might have been good to have them in a metal boxed collectible format, but hey, I bought the movies for the movies, not the packaging.

0066620996|4.0|Good to Great by Jim Collins overall was an excellent read. The concepts described in the book were very thorough but became repetitive in some of the middle chapters. The repetition became dull at times, but Collins would come right back with something more interesting. The analogies used were excellent because it gave the reader a clear understanding of each concept. My favorite part was when he described the bus concept and how to pick the right people for that bus. He definitely came up with unique ideas on how to illustrate what he was trying to say.<br />Although he chose certain companies that would be great in a 15 year span, a company today, Circuit City, is out of business. This could have possibly occurred due to the lack of keeping up the concepts of the book. Some of the concepts that Circuit City possibly weren't consistent with could have been the level 5 leadership concept. Collins heavily emphasizes the importance of level 5 leadership. I would agree that this concept is important and should be included in every type of business. I enjoyed how he did not describe this concepts as common sense and gave the reader a clearer and more fun understanding.<br />Another thing to appreciate about this book would be the detailed charts that would show the success in the good-to-great companies versus the comparison companies. This definitely came me an idea of how much the company really gained success with the concepts of hedgehog, level 5 leadership, culture of discipline, flywheel, and other.<br />If you are looking for ideas on how to become a great company, I suggest reading this book for the excellent concepts that seem possible for every company.

1401300529|5.0|Halberstram was a great author and his chronicles of important events have provided us with a valid and unvarnished true recounting of events and the people who shaped them. His portrayal of Generals MacArthur and<br />Almond and their egotisitical natures and how they cost thousands of lives. This book strips away the veneer of some of our vaunted \\"heroes\\" and tells the true story of how the Korean War was almost lost. I love Halberstram's writing and the way in which he doesn't hold back when criticism of decisions are justified.For instance, he portrys General Almond as a \\"yes man\\" to MacArthur and as a tyrant to his subordinates.<br />Robert A.

1423119509|5.0|I am in my early 20s and am drawn the Children's Fantasy series due to my interest in education. I found the stories to be very creative, original, and a great way to get kids to read. The stories are not as complex as the Harry Potter series, which makes for an easier read. It also sets up the reader to explore more into Greek mythology, a personal favorite of mine. Recommend to any parent trying to get their child interested in reading.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I know that there was a lot of controversy surrounding the making of the movie but at the end of the day it is the typical Disney movie that is intended to inspire and make our children dream. The movie has a great concept around it, one that focusing on what people need rather than want. The message is clear, love and family matter most.     Little children obviously wouldn't understand the concepts but for them the music is lively and the characters are loveable. I have a three year old and she sings along with the music and tries to play her own toy instruments to go along.     I would recommend this movie to anyone. I think it is a great movie!

0385341075|5.0|Mister Pip by Lloyd Jones is a book for book lovers. Set in a village on a tropical island that has been completely cut off from the rest of the world, the children learn to understand life differently through the guidance of the only white man on the island, Mr. Watts. The coming-of-age story of Matilda will makes readers appreciate their lives, libraries, and education.<br /><br />We Salute You Mr. Dickens:<br />- When asking any bibliophile why they love to read they're bound to give you some variation of the answer, \\"It lets me escape.\\" Matilda and her friends learn about this power at a critical point in their lives, giving them something to look forward to during a very difficult time.<br />- Jones' characters are simple yet complex; the dialogue and the plot are described somewhat simply, yet the message conveyed to the reader is far more complicated.<br />- I despise cheesiness. The subject matter of this text had the potential to be a bit heavy on the saccharine, yet Jones reins it in through Matilda's narration. It's inspirational without being nauseating.<br />- The narrative voice and thread is unique; without giving away the ending, her later life allows her perspective to make sense.<br />- There is a darker side to this text, exploring both race and class, and how the connected disputes have changed the island's way of life.<br />- The novel is the perfect length, and the pacing is done appropriately.<br /><br />Some May not Appreciate:<br />- It's slightly graphic at times (violence and sexual innuendos).<br />- It's obvious discussion of race.<br />- The fate of some of the characters.<br /><br />I appreciate what Jones has done as far as creating layers in this text, as well as providing readers with a different perspective. A fairly quick read, it will leave you satisfied and excited to read more of Jones' work.
B00004XPPE|5.0|I recall watching this as a teenager during what to me seemed to be the height of the Cold War, sometime around the time The Day After aired in the 1980s. I remember it vividly but upon watching something again so many years later I always prepare myself to be disappointed - but there was no need for that preparation. I was very pleased that this movie was every bit as good as I remembered it. The cast is just stellar and the direction tight and well-done. I especially enjoyed Fonda's performance as the President (who wouldn't have voted for this guy - he just looks like a President) and Larry Hagman's depiction of the translator oddly named just \\"Buck\\". The story itself is chilling and (at the time) quite plausible. The effects leave a lot to be desired even for 1964 but as the director's commentary explains the military did not want this film made and prevented the producers from obtaining any accurate footage of planes or the actual locations (White House, SAC headquarters, etc.).<br /><br />The picture quality is acceptable but nothing spectacular with occasional but non-bothersome contrast changes and film splices seen in a good print but without restoration. The special features include a short documentary on the movie featuring George Clooney who produced the live-TV remake done in 2000 (which I have never seen but would now like to). The interviews give some insight into both the cold war and the accompanying blacklisting of writers - one of which wrote this film under a pseudonym. The full length director's commentary yields some interesting insights into the obstacles to making the film (as noted above) and some of his technique including camera positioning and pacing of edits / cuts but overall was a bit less interesting than other director commentary tracks I have listened to.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great film and well worth the purchase - they don't make them like this any more!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I absolutely adore this story. I read it for the first time when I was 12 and I just read it again as I am about to give it to a group of girls I tutor. This book has some wonderful things to say about the beauty of life and the dangers of conformity. I would recommend it to anyone 11 or above because there are some things in it that may be a little too emotionally taxing for younger readers.
0142410373|5.0|Ever since I was seven years old, in a classroom with my friends reading this book together, \\"Matilda\\" has been my favorite book of all time.  Taking place in a English community in the late nineteen hundreds, Matilda lived unnoticed in others' lives.  That is, until she asks her father for a book.  Her parents, who didn't appreciate Matilda as a daughter, looked upon her as nothing.  When Matilda finally goes to primary school at the age of 5, her teacher, Miss Honey, finds incredible intelligence in this small girl.  Through this story, the principal, Miss Trunchbull, tortures kids with their parents unknowing.  Even the slightest thing ticks her off and she will explode in any moment.  Matilda uses her brains against her, when she finds a hidden power within her eyes that makes her able to move things with her thoughts.  When Miss Honey reveals that Miss Trunchbull is her aunt, and that she has taken everything that her father left for her, Matilda formulates a plan to get it all back.  By posing as Miss Honey's late father, Magnus, Matilda \\"chases\\" Miss Trunchbull out of the city.  It ends, of course, happily, with Matilda's parents giving her away to Miss Honey, where they live happily ever after.  I recommend this book to people of all ages, from seven to a hundred and two, because this heartwarming tale brings all together.  Like his other books, Roald Dahl puts fantasy and magic into a book that would otherwise depict the life of a normal child.  He comes up with Matilda's powers, the Witches' alienation from others, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's grandeur to give us readers an amazing collection of storybooks that we can all enjoy.
B000URDCC6|5.0|A real classic of a movie.  Done in 1965, the year I was born.  I've looked forward to it every year and now I enjoy watching the DVD of it.  It's one of my favorites, and the \\"kids\\" in it were very professional.

I honestly think Bono told them not to film him in HD so it wouldn't show their age or something. I know it WAS filmed in HD because the YOUTUBE live video was more clear than this \\"blu-ray\\" (audio wasn't as good as this tho).  My wife even asked me if the DVD was bootleg!!!!!!!  It just looks like the put some digital garbage on it to make it look like a standard def DVD...and sometimes WORSE than standard DVD.    and WHY is BREATHE not the first track!?!?!?!?!??! (its a 'bonus' track)    ok, good points -- Bono actually sounds damn good throughout the DVD -- especially on Unforgettable Fire....and of course The Edge and the others sound good too.
0971407614|5.0|The heart of this book is the Programs which begin on page 143.  There are four 10 week programs which span basic to Master class levels of ability.   These are carefully thought out to vary in intensity, frequency and muscle groups.  I have finished week 5 of the basic workout and am impressed with the way my body is changing shape.  The author provides these as detailed examples but encourages the reader to use her imagination and improvise creatively.    Editing could be better as many have commented, but that is of little consequence as all of the exercises are clearly explained with numerous photographic illustrations.  I have read the whole book once through but repeatedly read only the program outlines and associated exercise descriptions and these are pretty good.    There is a helpful index of all the exercises on page 55, but it better placed at the end of the book.  I have taken to penciling in the page numbers next to the exercise names in the programs.    All of the exercise set types (ladders, interval sets, super sets, strappers, tabatas) are explained just prior to the program descriptions (at least one reviewer has incorrectly said otherwise).  However, there is ambiguity about how to interpret these explanations.  For example on page 141 in the explanation of Interval sets a bullet point is: \\"6-12 reps per set\\"; but on page 51 Interval sets are described as going \\"to failure\\".  I think it would help to have a sample actual work out explicitly spelled out in minute by minute detail.  Alternatively, a Youtube video link would be very helpful.     The author is not opposed to lifting weights (disguised as milk jugs filled with water, backpacks filled the brick, etc) but these are usually as suggestions to make an exercise more difficult.  Minimal equipment is required - most importantly a door, a table, a chair, a towel, etc.  However, you can \\"upgrade\\" as you like.  I prefer to use [[ASIN:B002LN9XJI Maximum Fitness Gear All-In-One Doorway Chin-Up Barwith Bonus Top 20 Exercises To Six Pack Abs Guide]] with homemade straps to do some of the exercises.      The author has a website with a forum which may turn out to be a useful ancillary resource for questions and explanations. ([...]).    I have increased my protein intake per the advice in the book, but I also have balanced that with calcium and vit. D supplements because it is known that increased protein intake has a side effect of decreasing calcium.  (Per Wikipedia under Calcium: \\"Research has found an association between diets high in animal protein and increased urinary calcium loss from the bones.\\")    What I like most about this book is that is a complete exercise program spelled out in detail.  Furthermore, once I have completed a least one of the 10 week programs, I will have the tools to create my own program using the principles I learned for a lifetime of fitness.

B003IWRE3I|2.0|The Road is an unrealistic post-apocalyptic genre film that offers no significant story or insight, yet manages to perpetuate the viewer's anticipation by its constant tension. Even though it offers a cutting glimpse into the survivalist chaos of the aftermath through it's poignant imagery, it lacks a definite grace. Ultimately, other than a sensational cameo by Robert Duvall, it fails to capture the viewer's heart (or head).      --> WARNING: Brief synopsis and spoiler alert    A father struggles to survive for himself and his son after his wife passes away, and they decide to migrate southward. However, the film offers no apparent reason why either of them set out on a venture across the devastated landscape besides the obvious search for food and shelter (which they already had plenty of before they left). Despite the obvious dangers of this quest -- cannibals, starvation, disease -- they head out on their own worthy pursuit.      One might surmise that the pair should seek out refuge amongst whichever spared tribes are left, yet the characters seem more interested in toughing it out on their own, giving the viewer a feeling of utter isolation. Indeed, even though they call themselves, \\"The Good Guys\\", rarely do they do anything genuinely good. They discover several vagabonds along their journey, but instead of taking them in they ship them out, and in one case -- rob them.     As the film drags on the two seem to make heady decisions that lead them away from the obvious targets they were seeking in the first place. This creates some consternation within the viewer's mind. For instance, why would they discover a fallout shelter stocked with food and decide to leave it for no other reason than boredom? A more ridiculous example, is when Vigo Mortensen's character decides to jump out into the ocean to swim to a beached freight ship while coping with what seems to be pneumonia, starvation, and exhaustion.     Not only do their goals seem flimsy but so do their methods. Why would you drag a rotten mattress outside to conceal an underground shelter? It seems like most people do not keep mattresses in their backyard -- that tends to stick out. Also, like another viewer said there is utterly no reason to keep food out in the open when you are amongst scavengers. Any sensible person would hide the goods while keeping them within a safe distance.     In summation, I would not recommend this film for any purpose other brief, shallow entertainment. If you are looking for a realistic survival movie or a poignant drama, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a typical Hollywood adolescent genre film, by all means.

1577314808|4.0|This book is another view of what so many spiritual teachers are saying, advising now. By that term, I mean Chopra, Myss, Virtue, Weiss, Choquette and others.<br />Tolle has been praised for the past two years so I finally read this book at my colleagues insistence. He does summarize what others say in a concise manner. Stay present. Forget the past, Forget the future. Stay loving and stay positive. Surrender all fears. I dont agree with some of his definitions but that semantics. However, there is one thing missing from this important piece of work. He had a crisis of faith like many of us and came out of it literally by waking up one day and feeling differently, I would say a Miracle by God to feel suddenly so Good and so detached and yet healthy and connected to the world.<br />  For the rest of us, we share that story, at least bits of it so others can grasp how we came out of the that dark time. I know I had to work tremendously hard the last ten years in order to have the perspective I have now that works well. I do all the above and I insist on being happy and focusing on joy. Many times in my lectures, and therapy sessions, I have to self reveal a little so my audience/clients know I have been in that difficult space and found the strength to overcome. I tell them how I did it. Many thank me for that. Tolle is missing this important part. Many need that I think in this day and age. Aside from that, I recommend the book to spiritual people, people trying to maintain a healthy attitude, people trying to improve themselves.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|I quite literally thought I was going to pee my pants while reading this wonderful novel.  The suspense builds in the first 40 or so pages and then its all go from there.  Kudos to Mr.Dashner to be brave enough to put his charaters lives on the line over and over again.     This book was so much fun to read. Theres something new mysterious and exciting happening ever chapter and the author never lets you down. No dissapointments at all!
B003ELOQCA|1.0|I went to this show in person and it was amazing.  That said, I just received this (single disc version) and I was very disappointed to realize that they did not include the opening song, which also happens to be one of the very best songs, of the show - \\"Breathe\\".  Now, I need to pay to return it, and re-order the two disc version, which has that song on the second disc.  I love U2, but they should have included all songs from the concert on the 1-disc version.  I can not understand why they would leave off their opening number, which was such a highlight of the show!

0802798225|5.0|Every once in awhile I come across a book that blows me away.  I started this book one night and only got to chapter 15 before I forced myself to put it down.  Once I put the book down, I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about it.  The next day I finished it and loved every minute.  I was jumping up and down for the book.  For me I will be buying the book in hardback and would love to send copies too all my friends.  It was a fantastic story about high school cliques, prejudice and forbidden love.  I could read this story over and over.  There is language and sexual content.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|The study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as Nature.  - An excerpt from \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" by H.G. Wells    The problem is, lovers and genetic scientists Clive and Elsa (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) don't know this. At least, they don't know this at first. Just like Dr. Moreau, it's all in the name of scientific progress and the belief that it will somehow benefit humanity. Their methods are, initially, totally objective; by splicing together the DNA of various animals, they create entirely new hybrid species, hoping to extract a gene that would provide protein and other necessary components for the sick and dying. They succeed, although they would like to go one step further and experiment with human DNA. Their company, while successful, will not provide any more funding, for Clive and Elsa's other hybrids are developing quickly enough to be marketed as visionary products of scientific research.    Not content with being held back, Elsa secretly introduces some human DNA into an assortment of other genes. Clive is wary; not only are they breaking the rules of the company, they're also toying with a host of ethical issues. Elsa remains confident. After all, she doesn't want to bring the new species to term. She just wants to see if it can be done. The thing is, the new life form grows at an advanced rate and emerges before it can be terminated. It's a strange although not altogether unlikeable creature, a female with a bulbous head and spindly legs and a tail. Elsa takes a liking to her immediately and names her Dren, which is the reverse of \\"nerd,\\" in this case not a putdown but an acronym for the name of their genetic corporation. Clive thinks it was a gigantic mistake. Regardless, they have essentially become parents, and they do whatever they can to keep Dren safe from prying eyes.    The greatest achievement of \\"Splice\\" is that, up until the ending, director Vincenzo Natali was ambitious enough to make it be more than a mere thriller. It's an absorbing blend of science fiction and philosophy, forcing both the characters and the audience into a number of thought provoking moral quandaries. Like Wells' \\"Dr. Moreau,\\" it intelligently raises concern over the pursuit of scientific progress while at the same time begging the question of what distinguishes animals from humans, if indeed there is anything to distinguish. In a matter of months, Dren evolves from a child (Abigail Chu) into full maturity (Delphine Chaneac); although she becomes progressively more humanoid in appearance, she has very clear animalistic tendencies, some of which are quite dangerous. And yet, her emotional development is much the same as that of a human girl - curious about what her \\"parents\\" forbid, mindful of her changing appearance, and, most interestingly, becoming aware of her sexuality.    The film also presents us with a look at Clive and Elsa, who seem caught in that unendurable gray zone between cold analysis and emotional attachment. Elsa is especially fascinating, drawn to the methodical and objective nature of science but also harboring deep-seeded maternal instincts, in large part because her own mother didn't seem to possess any. Did she grow to love what started out as a cloning experiment, or did she deliberately create Dren for reasons other than scientific advancement? If it's the former, did she honestly believe anything different would happen? If it's the latter, what did she hope to get out of it emotionally and how did she think it would work? As for Clive, his reluctance belies a curious connection with Dren, one that may seem reprehensible but, given his relationship with Elsa, is also somehow justifiable.    Considering how compelling most of the movie is, it's a shame Natali opted for such a generic climax, the morally challenging aspects disregarded in favor of a routine monster-movie showdown. I can't help but wonder if there's an alternate ending strewn amongst the scraps on the cutting room floor, forit's hard to believe that a conclusion this manufactured was what the filmmakers had in mind. Up until then, we were actually being tested. We were actively engaging in a stimulating cinematic debate. I will admit that there's a satisfying air of mystery in the final shot, one that proves Wells' point: The study of Nature makes a man (or a woman) at last as remorseless as Nature. Still, the scene is hardly worthy of the events leading up to it, which are so well done that I simply can't look past them. In spite of the disappointing final act, \\"Splice\\" is an above average science fiction film, strong in character and tone, gripping in plot, and stimulating as a study of ethics.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|I was there too - and this was just a phenomenal show. I watched the footage from Glastonbury on the BBC the night before and when I got to this show, I was just blown away. Sky Arts broadcast excerpts from this concert last autumn, which, I guess, were just a teaser for this release. If I have a complaint, its that there should be more from the Glastonbury performance on here. But, The River, with steam coming off of Bruce, in a field of flags was just astounding

B001EN71DQ|5.0|First of all I would just like to say that I love the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. It all kicks major ass! The plot, the characters, the amazing special effects, it all reminds me of when I first saw A New Hope. The only weird thing was that the bonus feature disc for Episode III has the cover art: The Story of Star Wars, and not episode III. Nothing wrong with that, it still has all the features, it just seems very weir and confusing. Especially when that featurette isn't even featured on the disc! It was a promo at the beginning of the VHS version of Attack of the Clones. (I'm a geek).
B00364K6YW|5.0|They finally have the capability to restore this movie, and I a very glad they do.  The colors are more vivid, shading isn't a problem either, as it was with the earlier edition.  If you like this movie as much as my wife and I, get this new edition.

B000002J0B|5.0|1 The song remains the same - 9/10 - Has a great riff, and solo. But not the strongest song on the album.    2 The Rain song - 9/10 - The intro. Slower then most of the other songs. Vocals are great. Longest song on album.  The song gets even better at 5 minutes in.    3 Over The Hills and Far Away - 9/10 - When the song really starts, it starts great. Great riff. Probably the weakest song on the album, but still a great song.    4 The Crunge - 9.3/10 - One of the best riffs on the album.  Have you seen the bridge? Shortest song on the album.    5 Dancing Days - 9.3/10 - The guitar is great.    6 D'yer Mak'er - 9.5/10 - Such a great song, starting at the beginning. Great vocals, and the guitar is just as good. The solo is good. Some of Led Zeppelin's best drumming. Its one of Led Zeppelin's most famous songs.    7 No Quarter - 10/10 - My absolute favorite Led Zeppelin song, even over Stairway to Heaven. The opening is great, with the guitar solo.  The entire song reminds me of the genre space rock. Slowest song on the album, but in a good way. The vocals are great. The entire song is as close to perfect as I've ever heard.    8 The Ocean - 9.8/10 - The song really takes a different direction from the previous song, No Quarter. The guitar and bass are great on this song. He used to sing on the mountains, until the mountains washed away. The riff is great. The whole song is great but the best part is the ending and the solo. It is such a good way to end a great album.    9.5. It really doesn't get that much better then this album, this is also Led Zeppelin's best album.

I was very sceptical in purchasing an item from the internet for several reasons.  first-payment.  I was afraid that the card would get comprimized.  And second, I thought the quality would be below average.  But,I am thrilled with the quality of the DVD.  I expected it to be like a priate copy and of poor quality, but it was't.  It is crystal clear.  Thanks!  I will be purchasing again soon.

B001HN6940|5.0|It was a very exciting movie.   It starts off with Alice escaping from a wedding, she didn't want to get married.  Then she falls into a rabbits hole.   She wanders around wonderland until she finds the fat boys and their friends.    I don't want to give away any spoilers so.. It's sort of hard to write a review.    Pretty much this is one of those movies where it goes from very quiet to very loud, you have to keep your hand on the clicker the entire time to change the volume... That can be very annoying.    It gets especially good near the end of the movie, the last 20 minutes.  But then the last 5 are boring...  But that is the same with all movies.

0316017922|4.0|Outliers is more observation than advice; as it should be, considering the case it's making. It's nonetheless a highly relevant business-read - a convincing argument that great opportunities must be both forged, and unlocked. Similar to Tipping Point and Blink, Gladwell offers memorable anecdotes - himself obviously a student of his own \\"sticky\\" storytelling as defined in Tipping Point - packaging complex subject matter in distilled, memorable format for those of us making a living on something other than University Stipend.    Gladwell's mastery of storytelling seduces one into believing the complex to be simple. It's not Pop, it's Professional. I would sincerely urge critics to attempt to explain these subjects to an intelligent audience without using Gladwell's Simplistic, Unexpected, Concrete, Story-based approach.    With that said, Outliers is primarily Interesting, and Entertaining. It's a look at the makings of the ultra-success stories of our time and made me reexamine the relationship between gifts and opportunities. I'm sure it would pair nicely with Buckingham's works on [[ASIN:0743201140 strengths]] as a gift to any young entrepreneur. Memorable takeaways are the lack of relationship between IQ and success, and the 10,000 hour rule.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|If you have not seen Lost and you are skeptical of watching it due to bad reviews for the last season, then I must warn you that if you do not watch Lost you will regret it!     The ending to Lost was one of the most beautiful endings I have ever seen and if I could I would watch this show again for another six years even if I had to wait week to week and then for several months in between seasons.  This show is the best written show I have ever seen.  It encompasses and elicits a plethora of many emotions and develops its extremely diverse characters very well.
B003D83DPA|4.0|I will keep my review simple.    Video - I agree with some of the other comments. The video is poor, however as already mentioned it was shot on 16mm film. Plus in someways, between the dodgy fashion and haircuts (of those on stage and off!) it does take you right back to the early 1980's.    Sound - The sound is fantastic and in my opinion well worth buying the blu-ray for alone.    In short... if you love Dire Straits, buy this release.  If you are a \\"picture guy\\", then perhaps stick with the DVD version. However if you are a \\"sound guy\\" or just love great music, this blu-ray is for you!
B000002UUX|5.0|Rust in peace is widely considered to be one of thrash metal's finest albums.<br />A big reason why  is such a good album is guitarist Marty Friedman. Marty's skill on the guitar is by far the highest of any member of Megadeth; By pairing Marty Friedman with Dave Mustaine, Megadeth suddenly had one of the most potent duos in the scene.  Just check out the last two to three minutes of  Hangar 18.<br />Songwriting is top notch on Rust in Peace, ( Back in the day Dave Mustaine wrote some of the thrashiest riffs on albums such as Kill 'Em All, Killing is my Business, and Peace Sells) Each song on the album, , contains the best riffs Dave has ever written.<br /><br />It features Megadeth at their best, with technical riffing, very impressive shredding and soloing, and some nice bass work

The bass is, as mentioned, always very present, the vocals are clear and everything else is in order.<br /><br />TRACKS:<br />Moonchild: Great opener song. Comes in almost like a Jethro Tull acoustic song entry before quickly turning to something a bit heavier and more dynamic.This soon becomes a particularly fast-paced song about the fallen angel Lucifer.<br /><br />Infinite Dreams: Is a deeply perspective song. It begins with a spacey virtuoso guitar and then vaults into a galloping rhythm.The vocals are harmonic, the rhythm is compulsive and everything works together perfectly.<br /><br />Can I Play with Madness: Is the most mainstream track on the album and contains a completely different vibe than the more melodramatic efforts elsewhere.The extremely poppy chorus would become a sore spot for many long time fans<br /><br />The Evil That Men Do: The lyrics are strong and the repetitive chorus works without dragging on somehow. The lead work is very powerful and the vocals show off Bruce's talent perfectly.<br /><br />Seventh Son of A Seventh Son: A epic ten minutes song,probably THE BEST SONG OF THE ALBUM,amazing intro,great solos from Dave Murray and Adrian Smith with the help of the master of bass guitar STEVE HARRIS.<br /><br />The Prophecy: Bruce almost hisses the lyrics as the drumming is pounded in a dancing rhythm.

B00000DSEN|5.0|1990 a new decade and a new sound for Iron Maiden,  Adrian Smith, left the band and was replaced by Janick Gers, much more direct in sound, but a different atmosphere from 'Somewhere…' and 'Seventh Son…'. This is 'No Prayer for the Dying'!<br /><br />'Tailgunner' the first single is definitely not the album's highlight, catchy, nice bass intro,  One of the album's best songs is the half-ballad and title track 'No Prayer For the Dying', nice melody, good vocals and great solo,<br />'Public Enema Number One' is yet another solid performance, 'Fates Warning' is one of the more atmospheric songs, dark intro and guitars<br /><br />'Mother Russia' the last song has a really freezing atmosphere, especially the intro and then throughout a dream of bass and guitars  we are caught in a very russian march, .The whole atmosphere seems to be transporting you via feet through the snowy and icy winter of Moskva or some other place in Russia.<br />That makes 'No Prayer' not a bad album, not at all, but  it's a change in the, sound and songwriting of the band,<br /> In general this is an album for the deepest winter, to make you freeze even more. Slightly better then very good, but not good enough to be almost a masterpiece

B0029NY9Y4|2.0|This dvd version is the theatrical release - not the director's cut.  As far as this version is concerned, it is about an hour too long.  I'm kind of amazed I saw this film and dozed off only once for about a five minute period, which I replayed after waking up.<br /><br />I did read the mini-series when it came out 20 years ago, but have long forgotten the details, so no worries about me comparing the two in this review.<br /><br />This movie is set in an alternate history, where Nixon is still President in 1985, and the threat of the Cold War turning hot is still real. In this world, superheroes are into forced retirement.  One, the Comedian, is murdered.  Another, Rorschach investigates as he feels that all the ex-superheroes are in danger. The background story is that the Cold War is heating up and President Nixon keeps moving the DefCon level lower. Kudos for keeping both themes relevant to the story to the end.<br /><br />This isn't a stereotypical comic book action film, it is a crime/suspense drama that involve comic book characters.  On a deeper layer, the movie examines the theme: Does the end justify the means.<br /><br />The actors and actresses did a pretty good job with fleshing out their characters, so they all had nice distinct personalities, though you can clearly see the Clint Eastwood \\"references\\" with Rorschach. It's with Rorschach that the movie does the character best. With the exception of Dr. Manhattan, there was no character development, and that was minimal and some of the scenes were redundant in force feeding the viewer into his character flaws. Thus, I thought some of the scenes that set up the relationships the characters have with each other were unneccessary.  I also found these scenes to be slow.<br /><br />The last hour of the film was good. You have action, suspense, and the tying up of the loose ends.  Dr. Manhattan's character growth also occurs during this hour and Rorschach and Nite Owl's short exhanges with each other add to their characters.<br /><br />The movie also starts off good, with a murder scene and the introduction of a protagonist (Rorschach)who suspects a conspiracy to eliminate a group of people.  It's just the middle part that is a struggle, and this movie gets a two because the boring part is about 90 minutes, equivelant to a shorter theatrical release film.arts off good, with a murder scene and the introduction of a protagonist (Rorschach)who suspects a conspiracy to eliminate a group of people.

Take responsibility for your own actions.    Season six is available as a standalone product if you want it.

BUT the music is so good (thank you, Ry Cooder and Steve Vai) and the OTHER lead performance is absolutely brilliant. Joe Seneca is note-on perfect and really, really engaging as old bluesman Willie Brown.

044022425X|4.0|I was hoping the author could continue the magic that has surrounded this series since I began it.  While this is the first in the series that did not get a 5 rating from me, I still wasn't disappointed.  I've got a couple things I think make the story a little different that the first 3.  My first thing is that Jaime and Claire have almost settled down it seems.  Besides the Indians and living in the complete wild, there doesn't seem to be as much danger or intrigue as before.  It's not really a bad thing, it's just a change of pace that you aren't really ready for.  And funny, I never thought myself as the harlequin romance type, I kind of missed that all out passion that Jaime and Claire have.  It's kind of absent in this book (not so much the feeling but that act).  And last, I didn't like Brianna in the past.  She's a modern young women  who refuses to acknowledge that her ideals do not really have place in the 1700's.  Claire seemed to step right into that past and find her place.  I think Brianna will be ok, but only because she will be surrounded by those who know or come from the future as well.<br />Now, all that being said, I still really liked the book.  I love the history that is woven in.  I think it's admirable how Jamie and Claire carve a niche out for themselves in the colonies.  All this while trying to keep themselves in the background to avoid any political ties because they know they aren't far from the Revolution.  I liked the dealings with the Indians.  I learned a few things I didn't know and shed some light on things I really wouldn't have understood.  It still beautifully written even if it can seem a bit long.  I will be looking forward to the next in the series!
B00275EGWY|2.0|I can be a bit of a film snob.  Anyone who knows me personally (or who reads anything I post on Amazon) will agree with that.    When \\"The Hurt Locker\\" built momentum towards the 2008-2009 awards season, I expected at least a good movie.  I know that one man's masterpiece is another man's overrated piece of garbage.  But I pretty much like everything.  I can justify just about any movie's existence, even if I don't care for it.  When it comes to movies I don't like, I can at least understand why many others love it.    \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is a failure, pure and simple.    I have watched this film 6 times, and I've given up trying to play devil's advocate for it.  I don't understand its message.  I don't understand its power.  I don't understand its greatness.  I don't understand its critical praise and reputation.    You may ask, \\"Then why do some people like it?\\"  There are 2 reasons I came up with: Craft and Context.    In terms of craft, \\"The Hurt Locker\\" on a production and casting level is just fine.  Kathryn Bigelow (or her camera team) show some neat shots here and there.  The lead performances are fine, with Jeremy Renner working his heart out to bring his character to life.  And when the explosions go off, they look good.  There is a pretty decent sniper sequence about midway through the film, with finally some life breathed into the story.    Boy, I wish I had more good things to say than that short paragraph.    I suppose that brings me to the Context in which critical praise comes in.  It's very simple: The critics and audiences that enjoyed \\"The Hurt Locker\\" are bringing more to the moviegoing experience than the movie is giving back.  I've read comments like:  \\"It's a portrait of how soldiers are fueled on adrenaline.\\"  \\"It provides a fair reality of why we're in Iraq.\\"  \\"It's about the bravery of the men and women who serve our military.\\"    I don't disagree with those ideas, but \\"The Hurt Locker\\" doesn't tell you any of that.  Critics and audiences whobelieve there is a deeper message within \\"The Hurt Locker\\" cannot provide a single piece of dramatic evidence where the movie says any of that.  I don't say that as an attack on liberals, conservatives, patriots, or anarchists.  This is an attack on people who've brought their own personal politics and patriotism to a movie that is simply very light on plot, drama, and purpose.  The individuals who praise this movie are not playing fair with those of you have not seen this film.    You ever watch a murder mystery and wonder, \\"How in the world was I supposed to guess that he/she could've commited the crime\\"?  Ever see a plot twist in a film and say, \\"But if I watch this movie from the beginning again, this twist doesn't make sense\\"?    That's what it's like listening to the high accolades of \\"The Hurt Locker\\", and then sitting down and watching it.  How do I know if \\"The Hurt Locker\\" glorifies war or doesn't?  How do I know that this story of 3 men (and a few others) is --- or isn't --- a representation of our military?    I think the reason for all of this rambling is because either Mark Boal's screenplay is VERY thin, or Kathryn Bigelow & her crew failed to bring it life.  I'm going with the former because Bigelow is very capable of making a good action picture, and has experience with deep screenplays.  Mark Boal is new to the big leagues, and I'm sure writing his own observations into a script must've been a joy.  But it's not a joy for me, and I don't believe \\"The Hurt Locker\\" will stand the test of time.    The film just isn't that interesting.  The trio of soldiers get a bomb report, go out, defuse the bomb as best as they can, talk a little bit later.... RINSE, REPEAT.  There is not dramatic arc here.  There is little character development, and very little of it interesting.  The biggest character arc involving Jeremy Renner's lead role makes absolutely no sense when put it all together.  So you see, when logic fails, presentation is everything.  And I'm afraid some heated photography, some neat sound effects, and some machismo soldierly intensity aren't enough.  After all, how many different ways can you make a bomb interesting outside of the technical level?    I am proud of our armed forces.  I am proud that \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is one of the first films to put politics aside when exploring our Iraw presence.  And I commend Kahtyrn Bigelow, the cast, the crew, and even Mark Boal for getting their independent feature off the ground so that audiences could see it.    But all of these compliments should've gone to a much better film.  After 6 viewings, I was hoping to find it.  However, I think this is one of the most critically-overrated films in a very long time.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|The film is one of the very few ones that actually moved me and got me carried away along with its pace and flow right from the very start. The film makes us witness first and foremost the typical 1920's scenario brilliantly showcased throughout the film and secondly, a very genuine emphasis on Police Corruption. Anjelina Jolie as 'Christine Collins' delivers a brilliant performance, she leaves no effort in her role and does her every bit pretty well, she manages to satisfy you on every level of the film, her emotions as the desperate mother is extremely believable. From the very start right till the end, the film grabs your attention and glues your eyes completely to the screen, you may not dare to move a lid or a ball until you have fully witnessed everything right till the ending, 'Christine Collins'is a character whose emotions are very genuine and she could be just any mother next door or in your neighborhood. Its a fabulous film, not to be missed at all.

B001BKM3MQ|5.0|Continuum is arguably the best album John Mayer has ever put out, and one of my absolute favorite of all time. I can honestly say every song on the album is a pleasure to listen to, and several of them could have been released as singles. The difference between this album and previous albums of John Mayer is that he wrote and performed music that HE actually liked, not pop-rock songs that teenage girls like. The bluesy, soulful approach he took on this album makes it an unmatched treasure that lets you peek into the deepest recesses of Mayer's tortured mind. Get this album if you don't already have it, and listen to it in your car late in a summer evening with the windows down. John will either give you the reassurance that you're not the only person in the world without someone to hold, or make you thankful for what you have and hold on even tighter to the love of your life.
0316017922|5.0|I just finished listening the Outliers audiobook.  It was wonderful.  It is one on the best books I've ever read.  Gladwell has a great reading voice, too.  This was my first time reading Malcolm Gladwell, but I plan to read some of the others.  I enjoyed his explorations and explanations of success.  Often we read about the success of people and assume that they are 'gifted' in some way or possess some genius that the rest of us don't have, which makes us incapable of being as successful.  Gladwell does a great job of presenting logical and well-researched arguments that make one reevaluate these assumptions.  Opportunity does play a major role in shaping each and every one of us. I was born and raised in a small, run-down house, with no inside plumbing in rural Kentucky.  I had several life-changing opportunities that led to me becoming a first generation college graduate, an educator and earning a Master's degree.  In my family, as a child of parents who did not graduate from high school, I am an 'outlier.'
B00006IU73|5.0|I've got several different copies of this cd for extra tracks etc. It's rare that I would buy different versions, but this is simply a great album. Gotta say, however, the band would be better if they had a \\"real\\" bassist. Nothing imaginative in the bass area that would make the band even better. Great drummer. No doubt that Gavin Harrison is the most professional of the bunch, but a drummer PT doesn't make. The rest of the music is driven by sheer and powerful songwriting and a great mixture of the hard rock song and softer melodies. Definitely their best album.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Saw this in the theatres and could not wait to own it! I pre-ordered it and I recieved it the day after it's release, awesome!!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Back when I was about 13 years old, I heard a little song called \\"Without Me.\\" That song was so infectious for me at the time, that I decided to purchase Eminem's 4th album (counting Infinite), \\"The Eminem Show.\\" Now, being a 13 year old who was obsessed with that song, I was hoping for a whole album with that type of vibe, with the same goofy tone and funny rhymes. Well, I was a bit disappointed at the time I guess you could say. Fast forward to today, in my college years, when I got more serious with my hip-hop listening, and I gave the album some more chances. And I was hooked. I thought it was one of the finest hip-hop albums I've heard. Then I thought to myself, \\"What's the rest of this dude's catalog sound like?\\" Well, I had heard that Eminem's infamous \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" was considered his best album by many people, due to its shock value and incredible lyricism, so I said to myself, \\"HELL YES! I need to hear this immediately.\\" And wouldn't you know it, I wasn't disappointed. Here's a track by track analysis, excluding the skits (although I thought they were entertaining as hell, so I recommend listening to them):    1.) \\"Kill You\\"--An opening track that sets the dark, twisted mood for the album. The title of the song is pretty self-explanatory: he's rapping about killing people, particularly women. The perfect song to introduce what's to come. 4.5/5    2.) \\"Stan\\"--Despite this one being one of the singles he released, this has been one of my favorite hip-hop storytelling songs. It's basically about an obsessed fan who wants to be just like Eminem, and when Em doesn't answer back his letters, he goes off the deep end. Very dark with four brilliant verses filled with vivid imagery and masterful storytelling. Not to mention an awesome sample of Dido's famous breakthrough song, \\"Thank You.\\" 5/5    3.) \\"Who Knew\\"--The subject here is about Em's effect on society with his lyricism, and how he never expected people to take him so literally. Pretty solid track with dope lyrics. 4/5    4.) \\"The Way I Am\\"--Now THIS is good ol' fashion Eminem tearing ish up, and basically his \\"F-you\\" song to the world, revealing to everyone that he may sound and act like a jerk, but that's just the way he is, and to just leave him alone. One of my favorite tracks on the album in which Em shows some true emotion. 5/5    5.) \\"The Real Slim Shady\\"--I remember this one WAY back in the day as one of the first rap songs I had ever heard, and it's still a nice song to listen to. Yeah, it's one of his typical lighter singles that disses celebrities with a lot of animated lyrics, but it's one of his better ones. Plus he has a lot of funny lines in there. Not to mention bangin production from Dr. Dre himself. 4/5    6.) \\"Remember Me\\" (featuring RBX and Sticky Fingaz)--Another one of my favorites of the album, especially because of the two guest spots. The song starts off with a sinister-sounding, yet brief verse from RBX to set the malicious mood of the track. Then Sticky comes on and SLAUGHTERS it. By the time Eminem does his thing with his verse, it'll be easy to see that Sticky definitely had the best, and most badass verse on the song. They all kill it, though. 5/5    7.) \\"I'm Back\\"--Basically another song in which Eminem puts up his middle finger some more to the world and spits some more of his controversial lyrics, even having a line about Columbine being censored ON THE EXPLICIT VERSION of this album. Very good track, though. 4.5/5    8.) \\"Marshall Mathers\\"--Here's a track in which he starts getting personal with some people, particularly Insane Clown Posse and a bunch of pop artists that were doing it big at the time. Here you hear the emotion in Em's voice once again, dropping some knowledge over a somber beat. 4.5/5    9.) \\"Drug Ballad\\"--In my opinion, this is probably one of the weaker tracks on the album. It's pretty much a party song about drugs. Nothing special, but there's some sharp lyricism as usual. 3.5/5    10.) \\"Amityville\\" (ft.Bizarre)--This one is reminiscent of a horrorcore rap song, rapping about killing with sick, vivid lyrics. Em even makes a mention of murder being notorious in Detroit in his last verse. A solid song with a haunting beat. 4/5    11.) \\"Bitch Please Pt. II\\" (ft. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Xzibit)--A very pimpilicious posse cut with everyone spitting some hot fire over a funky Dre production. Nuff said. After the last couple of songs, this definitely picks things up a little bit again. 5/5    12.) \\"Kim\\"--Oh. My. Goodness. THIS is the song that makes this album special. It's Eminem's murder opus directed toward his ex-wife, complete with shouting and shocking lyrics to go along with it. There's a reason this song is talked about so much. Probably not for the squeamish, but if you can handle it, it's one damn good song. Yeah, I feel kind of strange and twisted admitting it, but this is one of my favorites simply because of the emotion and anger put into it. One of Eminem's best songs ever. 5/5    13.) \\"Under the Influence\\" (ft. D-12)--After \\"Kim,\\" this song was a letdown for me. Nothing really special here except more absurd lyrics, with a guest spot by Eminem's group, D-12. One of the weaker tracks on the album. 3.5/5    14.) \\"Criminal\\"--A very fitting outro. He's basically saying to not take him seriously, despite his shocking lyrics that can make him sound like a wanted criminal at times. There's some humorous lyrics mixed with some clever lines as well, and it's just a great way to end the album. 4/5    So, overall, this album isn't quite the classic that everyone may say it is, but it's pretty damn close. After all, this album DID define who he was as an artist. If you haven't checked it out yet, go give it a listen. It's definitely worth it if you're a fan of hip-hop, or just music in general. Unless you just want to be a troll and say the man's music is bad without giving it a chance. In that case, stay in your little cave with the other trolls.

B000AJIF4E|3.0|These headphones only sound \\"O.K.\\", which is why I gave them three stars.  (4 stars is \\"Great\\", and 5 stars is \\"Outstanding\\").  The low bass is good, but the mid-bass is lacking.  The midrange and high-end are  slightly exaggerated and strident.  Cymbals are unnaturally bright, and the spoken/sung \\"S\\" letter has too much sibilance in some cases.  I have been comparing these headphones with my pair of MDR-V900 headphones.  Although the mid-bass of the MDR-V900 is a little muddy compared to these headphones, they don't have the high-midrange to high-end over-exaggeration that the MDR-7506 headphones.<br /><br />These headphones are a decent value, but are not better than \\"O.K.\\".  They are adequate for general use.  I bought them for my 10 year-old daughter's use with her first MP3 player (a Sansa Fuze).  They are wildly better than the earphones I see so many people using.<br /><br />If you want \\"great\\" to \\"outstanding\\" headphones, you are well advised to look elsewhere.

1439153663|4.0|Kathleen Grissom's \\"The Kitchen House\\" was a really \\"fun\\" read...and by \\"fun\\" I mean that it was a gripping, can't-put-it-down read!  In particular, it is a fascinating, harrowing, disturbing look at slavery on a plantation from the later 1700's and into the new century but before the Civil War would put an end to this violation, this human degradation, for which we must forever be ashamed.  Each chapter is told from the viewpoint of one of two characters, Belle, a slave fathered by her mother's master, and Lavinia, white, Irish, parentless, an indentured servant, who forms close bonds with the slaves around her.  So much happens through this book's 350-plus pages that one regrets those occasions when the book must be set aside; and when the book does end, I found myself wishing for more, wanting to know how the remaining characters would handle a war that was fifty, sixty years away.  Perhaps some might not have even been living when the clash between North and South would break out, but offspring would be.  Suffice it to say, though, that, in Grissom's very capable hands, you have a story that plays out in such a manner that will leave you anxious for the author's next effort.  Very entertaining, yet informative, Kathleen.  It's what \\"losing\\" oneself in a good book is all about.
0307270807|1.0|This is the worst book I've attempted to read in a very long time.  I say attempted because I've gotten through about the first 50 pages and I simply can take no more -- I'm headed back to the bookstore for an exchange.  Most of the negative reviews hit it spot on.  It's written in Jack Kerouac stream-of-consciousness style, with plenty of bad grammar, run-on sentences, and dated 1960s vernacular -- groovy man.  It's pretentious.  As an example, we are constantly reminded that the author listens to Hendrix, which apparently gives him some sort of worldly insight that the rest of us just don't have.  Worst of all, I have no idea what the author is trying to convey in those pages that I've read -- I've come away blank.  I'm astounded at the positive reviews this book has garnered over the years.  I've written only one other review on Amazon, but my passionate dislike of this book pushed me to add this one.  Apparently quite a few people like this book, but I say stay away.  If your searching, in my humble opinion CHICKENHAWK stands out as the best war memoir I've yet read from the Vietnam era.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|Paolo Nutini is an incredible artist.  Although young in years, he is an old soul musically.  Passionate would be the best descriptive word for someone who writes all his music, songs written in vivid colors, no pastels.  it is apparent every time he sings that he feels the music to his very soul; that's why watching his performances on YouTube is so compelling with a powerful voice that sometimes has a hint of Rod Stewart, he's beautiful to look at and his brogue only adds to his allure.  I'd like to give him ten stars out of five!

B0001ZX0OW|4.0|I'll admit it's been a while since I've seen Mystic River in the movie theater. While initially my impression of the film was disgust(especially with the ending) I've recently picked up the DVD and watched it again with a new perspective. Mystic River is pretentious with it's self-importance and some will still argue whether or not the hype (and subsequent Academy Awards) is justified, however the honesty and emotions running through the film make it one of the more memorable films of it's time.<br /><br />Mystic River is basically a melodramatic tragedy about three friends and how their actions effect the people around them. Sean's a cop, Jimmy's an ex-con, and Dave's their friend who was sexually molested when they were all kids. The movie centers around the murder of Jimmy's daughter and the actions the three friends take to deal with it. There's alot more to the story of these damaged characters and the film mostly focuses on their personal lives rather than the murder investigation itself. The movie's very raw and there is no happy ending for any of these characters. It's a very cynical story, but Clint Eastwood films Mystic River like an overbearing melodrama with over-the-top acting, camera work and music which at times is really unnecessary and gives the movie an accelerated sense of self-importance (which in my opinion is VERY annoying). I think Mystic River would've benefited with a more documentary approach and better shots of Boston (the movie's called 'Mystic River', why not show more of it?).<br /><br />The acting, while sometimes over-the-top is very solid and believeable. Sean Penn is well cast as Jimmy and while the scene of him finding out his daughter's dead is waaaaaay over-blown his quiet intensity rings true through the rest of the film. Tim Robbins is perfectly sympathetic as the tortured Dave and you really feel terrible about what happens to him at the end of the movie. Kevin Bacon is a great actor but I felt Sean was a bit under-used as a character, though I can understand since most of his actions in the novel focused on him investigating Jimmy's daughter's murder and the film is more about the character's personal lives.<br /><br />The one bit of this movie that feels like a giant misfire is in how the ending is handled. SPOILER ALERT!----------<br /><br />As I said in my opening I was disgusted and quite outraged with the ending of the film because in a lot of ways it seems to try and justify Jimmy's actions. Jimmy isn't supposed to be likeable despite the fact he really feels he's doing the right thing. I also hated how it de-humanized Dave and made his murder at Jimmy's hands seem \\"all for the best\\" with Sean's dismissiveness (in the novel Sean's much more progressive about the situation). It sort of gives the feeling that Dave deserved to die simply for being a child-rape victim. It certainly didn't help when Laurence Fishburne's character claiming Dave should be locked away simply for being a victim of sexual abuse. Sort of spreads the message that sexual abuse victims are less than human.<br /><br />I like to think this was just a misstep on the filmmakers part thanks to Clint Eastwoods more sensationalist direction. I like to think what happens to Dave in the end is just part of the human tragedy of the story and NOT trying to justify Jimmy's actions as a concerned parent. I don't think Jimmy and Sean's actions in the end are unbelieveable though. Jimmy's already murdered someone before so obviously what he did isn't going to haunt him for too long. Sean's too caught up with his wife and kid and despite knowing what Jimmy did feels no matter what he does now can only make a bad situation worse by going after Jimmy(or maybe he does? The ending's a bit ambiguous). It's not a satisfying ending nor do I think it's meant to be. It is however very believeable and I think that's what the filmmakers were trying for.<br /><br />So while Mystic River is far from the flawless masterpiece it claims to beit is a very powerful film. I can't say everyone will enjoy it, but it's a movie that no one will forget.one will enjoy it, but it's a movie that no one will forget.
0812550706|5.0|My daughter Lydia and I were looking for good reading and thanks to the book list from 'A Thomas Jefferson Education' we found Ender's Game. (TJ Ed is great read on becoming truly educated, BTW and Ender fans will relate to it).<br />[[ASIN:1615399917 A Thomas Jefferson Education: Teaching a Generation of Leaders for the Twenty-First Century]]<br />[[ASIN:1615399941 Thomas Jefferson Education for Teens]]<br /><br />I'm sure I won't be able to add much more than others have said here beyond my rating and a quick thing or two about our family's reaction to the book. Lydia (almost 13 and a sci-fi, fantasy gal) loves Ender and reading it aloud with me  :-)<br /><br />My 15 year old Colin ( well, 15 when he reads this on his Birthday Sunday! Happy Birthday Colin... hope you enjoy Ender and the funny Mom note) is a stickler for people treating each other well and characters making mostly wise decisions.... He's going to give Ender a shot (beyond catching bits and pieces from Lydia and I reading), because he's loving the brilliance of Ender's thought process (he loves Sherlock Holmes as well)... But, he really dislikes the continual, unfair torment Ender goes through.<br /><br />Now my wife Lisa Locks us in the shed with the puzzles to keep us from going on and on about how much we love this and that aspect of the book... Just kidding! But she probably could do without all the references to farts... just sayin'.<br /><br />So everyone will relate to Ender based on who they are, like any book... but because Ender's Game is not the inoffensive, unimaginative twaddle of so many new releases, it stirs up controversy and the love it or hate it thing. I'm thrilled to have found it and wish it was around when I was a kid to carry Ender as a peer... who won by being intelligent and different.
0061537969|1.0|I had high hopes for this book - it sounded interesting but boy, what a bore.  I got through the first six chapters or so and realized I was only reading so I could be finished with it.  The narrator, Enzo, is a dog, but that turns out to be a gimmick more than anything else - he doesn't really seem to have a dog's point of view.  I kept getting the feeling that the author sat down and said, I know, I'll write a book about racing because I like racing.  And dogs, because I like dogs.  And I know, I'll write it from the dog's point of view.  But it doesn't gel - the emotional distance between the dog and the human characters is too great and the action happens too far from the reader.      If you want a great story told from the point of view of a dog (and I'm not sure the idea can support a novel-length narrative, the essence of being a dog is living in the moment, not telling long tales about what has happened), check out \\"The Mixer\\" in [[ASIN:1153711125 The Man With Two Left Feet and Other Stories]].

I've even gotten my older sister and a bunch of nephews hooked on this show.<br /><br />The first episode sets the stage for a great good-vs-bad storyline.  Spartacus himself is an honor-bound man who, against his nature, is compelled to become a gladiator.  As the series continues, the \\"bad\\" guys are shown to be even worse than you initially could imagine, while the \\"good\\" guys fight to retain their dignity through it all.<br /><br />Okay, so there's some serious swearing,bloodletting, and nudity/sex, but you should expect that from a \\"Mature\\" series.  The good guys do not always win, and the bad guys do not always get their comeuppance, and that's true in modern life, too.
0399230033|4.0|We LOVE Good Night, Gorilla and so does our 21-month-old child. Vivid, bright colors, a fun & imaginative story, and a surprise ending, all wrapped-up in a sturdy board book. The story is told primarily through the pictures with minimal text; a plus for imaginative readers. We make up words to describe what's happening in each scene as we read it to our child, and he also loves 'reading' it by himself! Highly recommended. [[ASIN:0698116496 Good Night, Gorilla]]
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am a fitness enthusiast, have run marathons, and spend a lot of time at the gym. I was looking for a home workout that I could do when short on time or not in the mood to go to the gym, and after reading many reviews on Amazon, settled on this one. I was not disappointed. Even for someone in good shape, this workout is challenging. For me, doing this DVD alone wouldn't be enough to get \\"shredded\\"--that requires a lot more cardio. But if you have limited time and want a good workout, this is a great option.    I've given it only four out of five stars for two reasons:  1) I think it's misleading to tell buyers they will be shredded in 30 days if they do this workout. Depending on your fitness level when you start, you will likely be in better shape than before, but I seriously doubt that anyone is going to get shredded doing this workout.  2) Although it's a great workout, I think Jillian could do a better job of educating her audience in the process of getting them in shape. I personally like to hear the workout methodology, rather than just being told to do something.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|I was delighted to hear The Rocky Road to Dublin at the end of the movie because I recognized this version by The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem.  When the credits rolled, The Dubliners were listed as the singers.  I have The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem record, \\"The First Hurrah!\\" with the Clancy Brothers singing and Tommy Makem playing the tin whistle on Rocky Road. The movie credits should have listed them as the singers and not The Dubliners.
0805079831|5.0|I was born in Puerto Rico.  I came by this book because of an e-mail relating the current governor's dismantantling and selling of public services and the socail safety net, massive firings of public employees and all over assault on the culture to Milton Friedman's economic theories.  Needless to say, that governor is allied to and receives his marching orders from the Republican Party, which is using my unfortunate island as yet another laboratory for the ideology of the \\"free market\\".  It is unnerving to read Klein's description of what has been inflicted on Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Indonesia, Irak, Iran and countless other countries by corporations and their principal minion, the USA government.  This is a book that most be read by anyone not familiar with the true ascent of the American Empire: disaster capitalism.
B003A4IFDW|5.0|If American Idol wants someone who can demonstrate the art of \\"making a song your own,\\" they need to reach out to Bettye LaVette.  On this album, LaVette takes classic British rock songs and offers radical renovations that play to her powerful soul and funk artistry. There is a lot of poetic justice here, as 60's British rockers borrowed heavily from the Motown/soul catalogue during the 1960s.<br /><br />LaVette is one of those soul artists that \\"almost made it\\" in the 1960s, faded from sight, and resurfaced decades later, with blazing talent (check out Howard Tate and Solomon burke for other superb examples). Her voice packs a powerful emotional punch; you believe her when she sings \\"It Don't Come Easy,\\" and you hear the pain when she sings \\"\\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.\\"<br /><br />Each of the songs here is a work of art; there is no \\"filler.\\"  Standouts for me:<br /><br />1. The driving, funky delivery of the Beatles \\"The Word\\": beautiful brass, outstanding back-up singing, and Bettye's silky/sandpapery vocals.<br />2. \\"Isn't It a Pity\\": George Harrison's words take on additional poignancy thanks to the sparse, slower arrangement and Bettye's incredible vocals.<br />3. \\"It Don't Come Easy\\": Ringo Starr's pop song is transformed into a classic, classy Blues number. Bettye speaks with authority about \\"paying some dues.\\"<br />4. \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\": McCartney's beautiful song is a perfect vehicle for the raw power of LaVette's voice.<br />5. \\"Salt of the Earth\\": I'm a sucker for masterful back-up singing, and this twist on the Stone's song delivers a small sample of perfection (LaVette arranged the background vocals on all the songs on the album).<br /><br />The CD contains a bonus track: LaVette's performance of \\"Love Reigns Over Me,\\" that blew Pete Townsend's mind at the Kennedy Center Honors\\" concert in 2008.<br /><br />If you can get your hands on it, be sure to check out \\"Child of the Seventies,\\" the album LaVette recorded decades ago that remained unreleased until a few years ago, and her last two albums, Scene of the Crime and \\"I've Got My Own Hell to Raise.\\"of the Crime and \\"I've Got My Own Hell to Raise.\\"
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was referred this workout DVD from a friend who, like me, has had two children in less than two years. She raved so much about it. I decided to get it in order to try and get in better shape before my upcoming wedding. I am on day 8, I've already lost a few pounds, and I'm feeling great! I would definitely recommend this not only to my Mommy friends, but to anyone looking to drop a little weight and get in better shape FAST! Jillian is a beast, but she's fun, and really knows how to keep you going!
B000002OVJ|5.0|This album is amazing, each song is as powerful and great as the next. I had heard some of the songs of this album already, but when I heard \\"Young Man Blues\\" and \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\" I knew this was the best live album that you can get your hands on. Moon's drumming is absolutely incredible in every single song, and Daltrey's voice and vocal range is amazing. Townshend's guitar in this album is one of my favorite guitar tones I've ever heard. If you want to hear The Who in all their live fury and genius, buy this album.
B002E01LTI|3.0|Although this is Wesley Snipes at his finest, this movie came up short for several reasons. 1. It was not the American blu-ray version as advertised, it was a French Canadian Import. 2. Because of this there were no Subtitles and the Menu access was lacking and it was a cheaply made copy. After wrangling with Amazon for nearly a month (on the packaging it clearly states this is a French Canadian Import and also stated that it was only suppose to be sold in Canada only) I am hoping that I have straightened out the problem with Amazon. They have informed me that the distributor has a license to sell this product in the United States, even though the packaging states otherwise, and have vowed that they would in fact indicate that this is in fact an Import. On a side note the Blu-ray version of Ella Enchanted is also a French Canadian Import as was All the Blade Blu-ray movies and all should be marked as Imports now.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|This is the greatest animated series!  Everyone who's seen it identifies and smiles and laughs at the cynicism and witty dialog.  Amazon honored their pre-release lowest price policy, too!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I have read all 6 books and I have to agree with some of the others than have written - the series is much better. I can't wait to get the DVD set so I can finally erase all of the episodes off of my DVR :)
B002O01I9Q|5.0|If you're in any doubt as to whether you would enjoy this album, just read the lyrics [at [...]] and imagine them pleasantly sung [I never enjoyed his singing this well in the past] to a mix of celtic and blues accompaniments with tasteful -- rather than dazzling -- guitar [single-coil, double-coil electric, steel-string acoustic] plucked with facile fingertips, along with appropriately ethnic instruments. Knopfler has turned out a song cycle that would make any of the great folk or maritime singer-songwriters proud, offering new twists on timeless traditions.
B001C4CI8U|2.0|Spoiler Alert!    I watched Fringe every week and bought the DVD set.    Fringe is just not that good. It is slow. Something happens, let's go see what is going on. Every episodes are similar.  After the first season, I lost interest. The characters don't have any emotion. The show lacks content. The show has very little philosophical or psychological value. It doesn't make you think or connect.  This is definitely not X Files or Star Trek.    *Spoiler*        I like the idea that we are having a war between our parallel universe. I also like the idea that ET is watching. But again, after the first season, I just don't care anymore. It maybe nice if they give ET a bigger role to understand what make us human even in a parallel universe. But that will make Fringe another X Files and Star Trek show.    two stars from me.
B001YB29HG|4.0|A friend showed it to me on DVD and I had to pick up a copy. I admit I like only a short list of Musicals, from \\"Tommy\\" to \\"Wizard of Oz\\" (childhood Favorite), but this was funny and the songs were surprisingly catchy. But I have to remember that there was a singing \\"Buffy\\" episode too...
B002ZCY7PU|3.0|I watched Chuck every week but Season 3 was just terrible. Actually, right after Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) joined the show, everything went down to the drain.  Chuck used to be fun to watch. Everyone of us were Chuck one way or other who was just nobody. Chuck just wanted to be Chuck. Superman turned the show upside down completely.  Chuck wanted to be someone else now. Boring!    There was some fun moment but the focus was all on Clark Kent in Season 3. Who cared what Superman could do?
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This product is a must-have for fans who realized that there would have been no Star Trek in the first place and subsequent Star Trek shows and movies if this show had never aired. Star Trek: The Original Series is still the best that Trek has to offer. That's why the \\"Star Trek\\" movie (2009) was so successful because deep down, these are the characters that made Star Trek rock!!!<br /><br />My only criticism of the product is that Seasons 2 and 3 came with sleeves while my Season 1 box did not. Other than that, it was delivered in great shape.
1423113381|2.0|Ooooh, I wanted so badly to like this book.    As a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series, I bought this book the morning it came out.  Couldn't wait to read it, but it just didn't catch and hold my interest.  The storyline was okay, but the voices of Carter and Sadie aren't distinctive enough.  There were times when I couldn't remember who was speaking.  It felt unnatural to be reading it the way they supposedly talked into a recording device.    The Egyptian gods and goddesses and their stories didn't capture me -- admittedly, possibly because I knew far less about them than the Greek gods and goddesses.    I will definitely read the next in the series to see if I was wrong, but my first impression was one of disappointment.
0394873742|4.0|My kids love laying on the floor with this book.  It is really big in size. So, plan a place to store it. They love the details of the pictures and finding the words they know.
030726999X|4.0|My biggest problem with this book is that I won't be hearing from Stieg Larsson again.  I want to know more about almost all the characters, particularly of course, Lisbeth Salander.  It's been a long time since I've run across such an intriguing, strong heroine.  She's vulnerable and at the same time tough as nails.<br /><br />As an end (sadly) to the trilogy, I was unhappy with just a few things:  I really wanted to see Faste get his comeuppance (I honestly thought that we would learn he was on Dag's list of Johns), I wanted to meet Camilla, and I wanted Berger to finally say once for all that she'd leave Blomkvist alone (which she sort of did but you get the sense she's not sincere).  I also was hoping Modig would be promoted over Faste.  I assume that the author figured he'd been around to write more Salander books, but I guess we'll never know.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the kick-backside court scenes at the end, was pleased with Teleborian's future as well as those in SAPO, and it felt true to character how Lisbeth handled her freedom as well as a meeting with her dear brother.  And as with the other two books, I loved learning about Sweden and what life is like there (coffee saturated, for a start).  Well done, Stieg Larsson.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Great comedy!  I laughed all the way through it!  I have recommended this movie to many people and purchased it as a gift for two.  The characters were superbly portrayed. This is a must see!
0143058525|5.0|I am rather shocked in reading the overwhelming amount of negative reviews of a book which I found thoroughly enjoyable.  Most of these negative comments all have a similar theme, that Gilbert's memoir fell short - i.e. had no depth, self-indulgent, narcissistic, detached, contrived etc. - and yes there is truth in all of these criticisms.  For God's sake it is a memoir, a fair amount of self-indulgence and narcissism is required in even attempting to create such an artistic work by definition.  I read many reviewers quote other \\"memoirs\\" which are not ego-driven that readers should pursue, and I have to laugh, because to criticize one memoir on the basis of narcissism and praise another just shows that the reader obviously agrees or identifies with one author and doesn't with another.  So much for being unprejudiced as to thoughts that may not fall into line with your own.  So to all, if you don't like self-absorbed life commentary than don't read ANY memoir, they are all fueled and driven by ego and to deny this only shows that some exceptional writer has pulled the wool over your eyes.  However, if you enjoy reading about someone's life journey from a strictly self-centered point of view, no matter if you like or don't like what the author has to say, just to enter into someone else's thought life for a moment, than this book is for you.  And yes, if you like light reading and enjoy a magazine article, and don't want to take on anything heavy while you are enjoying your alone time with a book in hand, than this book is for you!  When did not being \\"deep\\" or some form of art as \\"shallow\\" become something to criticize?  I think only among groups of intellectuals who, dare I say are self-absorbed, find the need to attack something that doesn't fit their narcissistic view of what entails good art.  I enjoy watching documentaries, but I also like a Judd Apatow film every once in a while, and to those who can take a break from the seriousness and appreciate the geniusin the shallow - again this book is for you.  As a woman - in my early thirties, unmarried, no desire for children - I found the thoughts and inner struggle Gilbert let us into within herself was incredibly profound.  Not in that she is offering some sort of enlightenment or delving deep into the abyss of the woman's heart and soul, but in the questions she asks.  In the struggles she presents that she is working through.  Since as a reader I am in a very similar place the author was, at least in my life choices and desires, I find her literary voice to touch me in a place I can rarely discuss with other people, namely almost everyone I know who is on the path of wanting marriage, 2.5 kids, a mortgage and a dog.  I find it inspiring to see those thoughts, no matter how selfish or insecure or adolescent they may be to a larger audience, to be poured out without shame, though feared, and without a apology, however instinctually seems required.  I find her honesty refreshing, and though she can and does come off as any negative stereotype one could throw at her, which is usually the case when one truly opens up their inner thoughts without trying to disguise them in the colorful robes of humility and self-deprication, I appreciate her offering us the naked self stripped of self-protection, and dare I say the ugly self, the self that all of us have but keep well hidden.  There are times in life where we are all called or guided into being others focused, but those of us that do not have the demands of some of life's others-ball-and chains for a period can and should spend some selfish, self-searching time journeying into who we are and what truly fulfills us, if we are so lucky.  No matter where you are in life, Gilbert's story of a time when she allowed her life to evolve around nothing but herself and to search the unknown as to who that self really is and wants can inspire anyone through her conversational and even comical prose to desire to do the same in any smallmeasure, which I think as people is something we should all spend some time doing in our lives if anything to benefit the people who have to be around us in all the other times.  In short, take this memoir for what it is without expectation, and I think everyone who reads it without prejudice as to Gilbert's methods or conclusions of self-discovery (which although I found thought provoking and identifiable I didn't agree with all of the time), will come away with an inspiration that could change your life in a small way.  All this in a book that is not pretentious and does not guide you into \\"depths\\" that you are not in the mood for during your day at the beach, now a book that can do that, that's a GREAT book!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie is probably the best one ever filmed.  The characters are amazing and the film absorbs you so much that you do not realize the length of it.  The theme of this film is an old one, but a goody. This is a must for everyone.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Super Natural is one of the best series I've ever watched. It holds my interest. The humor, the brothers share just makes this series complete.

B001KVZ6G6|2.0|this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time. the story sucks. An old man pulling on a house trying to save a bird with the help of a fat kid and a dog with a collar that talks. do not waste your money.Not even my 2 and 5 year old like it.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is not just a collection of songs, as are 99% of today's music. It is rich, cohesive, fluid, tight--a movie for the ear. No filler whatsoever. The awesome songs are separated by interesting little \\"segues\\"--record static, a baby crying, a hateful death-threat message on an answering machine set to new age-y pianos and sounds of the sea, etc. The songs slam and rock and flow and churn and dream and scream and roar and hum and SING....It's amazing that this kind of music could produce such an organic experience....It could change the way you see guitars and drums....So creative and innovative and fresh and artistic and interesting. The more you listen to it (swim in it), the more you'll say to yourself, \\"This album is *awesome*...\\" Destined to be a legend, so don't miss it.
B000001Y79|5.0|Their best album. Although return of saturn was great also. I can't believe this album is 15 years old. WTF. I remember going to see Bush and No Doubt opened with the Goo Goo Dolls. Time flys!
B003102JDM|5.0|I loved this movie.  I've watched the uncanny opening scene several times on Youtube.  I'm puzzled by one  apparent dramaturgical error.  The wife stabs a learned rabbi, thinking he is a dybbuk because she heard from  her cousin that this man had actually died 3 years ago.  A dybbuk however is a living person who has been possessed  by the spirit of a dead person.  Its physical appearance is that of the living one, not the dead one, so it is not  possible for the rabbi to be a dybbuk in the way that the wife thinks he is.  Of course, we can interpret that the  wife herself misunderstands or does not know the distinction between a dybbuk and a ghost or revenant.    This is only a minor quibble.  The movie manages to be bleak and hilarious at the same time, in truly Kafkaesque  fashion.  I highly recommend it.
B00005QDW1|5.0|It's hard to believe this album is almost a decade old. Where does time go? For all you under twenty you will eventually realize what I am talking about. Anyway, this album is very good. It's not five stars, but I gave it five stars to off set the  people who trashed it.
B00004VVND|3.0|This film is one of the classic stories about robots developing their own thinking, and revolting against their creators. A pretty good film, with a somewhat anticlimactic ending. While the premise is a good one, I think that there could have been more done with the interaction between robots and park guests after the revolt began. Overall though, not a bad movie.
0385341075|4.0|Your first really good book is a bit like your first cigarette, your first drink, your first lover. It's an experience that lodges within you, one you keep coming back to, so deeply unique and personal you cannot share it on anything but the most superficial level. \\"Mister Pip\\" is at once a really good book itself, and a book about reading really good books.<br /><br />Matilda is a teenage girl growing up on Bougainville, a large island North East of Australia, during the early 1990's. A war of independence against the rulers on the neighboring island of Papua New Guinea is in full swing, causing the entire white population and many of the black, including the local schoolteachers, to flee the island. Only one white man remains, a lonely eccentric named Mr. Watts, who begins to teach the children of Matilda's village by reading from Charles Dickens' \\"Great Expectations.\\"<br /><br />At first glance, there's not much common ground between Victorian England and a tropical island, but the story of Mister Pip, the hero of \\"Great Expectations\\" who rises from poverty to riches, strikes a chord with Matilda and the other children, and their own dreams of escape. \\"It was always a relief to return to Great Expectations,\\" says Matilda. \\"It contained a world that was whole and made sense, unlike ours.\\"<br /><br />Fantasy is not always healthy of course, and reality, if shut out, has a way of kicking in the door. At first there is resistance from some of the more religious parents, including Matilda's mother, who feel the Bible is the only book worth reading. The not-quite-battle of words between Matilda's mum and Mr. Watts is a triumph of understatement, a subtle thing that swims beneath the surface of otherwise placid encounters. Later, the war intrudes, as you knew if must from the beginning, with sudden, deadly consequences for the entire village.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever felt affected by great literature will find resonance in the story. \\"Mister Pip\\" is a slim little thing, almost waif-like, weighing in at a hair over 250 pages. No Dickensian language or convoluted phrasing here: there is an economy of words and emotion in Matilda's voice, which only underscores the horror as events go from bad to worse. Yet in the end the novel's message is one of hope, if tempered by a realistic awareness of the limitations of what fiction can accomplish.<br /><br />Much could be made of white guilt in the setting of this novel, of the exploitation of Bougainville's copper mines, which leads to the rebellion, and of the backing provided to the Papua New Guinean government's efforts to crush it. Mr Jones acknowledges these issues, but never takes sides nor lets them overwhelm the main story.<br /><br />You might also be forgiven for feeling there's something a bit too \\"Dances With Wolves\\" about the story of a white teaching a black village, but Mr Watts is never presented as a heroic or wise figure, someone at the mercy of events rather than their master. The character of Matilda helps illustrate the interplay between the two cultures, with her fascination of Dickens balanced against her love of folk tales and stories, proving there is something for both sides to gain from the exchange. \\"We feel white around black people,\\" says Mr Watts, uncomfortable with the truth, only to be answered with \\"We feel black around white people.\\"<br /><br />I like the book, really I do--see the rating I gave it at the top of this review--but allow me to let my cynical side show for a moment. It must be said there's something a little self-serving about novelists writing novels that tell you how wonderful novels are--a bit too close to patting yourself on the back, that one.<br /><br />Still, with a work this accomplished Mr Jones can probably be forgiven for patting himself on the back a little. I can't say I will always remember it--the title of first great book is already taken for me--but it is one I will certainly be in no rush to forget.ng in at a hair over 250 pages.

0671449028|5.0|I LOVE this book. At first it was just a fun book to read before bed and then it became a bedtime staple in our house. As soon as my 11 month old see's the book she knows its time for bed. We read it every night and I have it memorized to read to her when the book is MIA. The last page says \\"The moon is high and the sea is deep and they rock and they rock and they rock to sleep, and I always rock her to sleep and put her in bed. A great way to end the night!

B0009WFFS6|4.0|Yes, I did enjoy hearing EC do a little more singing this time around.  His voice is better than ever.  But Cream always was and always will be Jack Bruce's first internationally-famous band, the vehicle that allowed him to become known outside the UK jazz and rock world.  Most of Cream's best original material was written by him and Pete Brown.  His remarkable voice and unequalled bass work were the hallmarks of Cream's sound, as far as I'm concerned.  Not to forget Ginger Baker's approach to rock drumming -- primitive jungle pounding, compared to what he had been doing as a jazz drummer.  His work on the reunion DVD is a revelation, much more nuanced than the original tracks.  As far as EC -- yes, he's a great guitarist and a terrific pop and blues singer.  But consider his playing with Cream against Chris Spedding's contributions on Bruce's solo albums.  Showy, long-winded solos were fashionable at the time (\\"Clapton is God\\" and all that), but it was so nice to hear guitar work that complimented and blended with the melodies of Bruce's songs on the solo records.  If you haven't delved into Jack Bruce's catalog of solo recordings, now's the time to do so!
B000Q67876|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo30A59KT8JQUS5]]Forgive me if I was repeating some stuff in the video. Again, there isn't a thing wrong with the video quality. It is, like is said, better (plus in widescreen edition) with color and sharpness enhancement.
0312935579|5.0|This story is told in a circular fashion. It starts with 78-year-old Emma Harte as a rich and powerful woman, who has called a meeting of all her family members, then it reverts to teen-aged Emma until she is finally the woman she was at the book's beginning. This MO made the first section vague and somewhat incomprehensible but everything fell into place eventually.  The plot was excellent. The horrors of war were vividly described as was the treatment of Jews and attitudes towards illegitimate children. Emma appeared to be very vindictive - totally bent on revenge but in the end she softened. The characters were so well done that at times one felt like slapping Edwina or punching out Gerald.   This story will make you angry, at times happy and other times reduced to tears. A terrific read.
B00000F14B|5.0|Movie is well done and includes many actors who are no longer with us. A rare find. It has become one of my personal favorites.

0307269981|3.0|I agree with a lot of those who found this book less interesting than the first one.  It did ramble a bit with characters who appeared from nowhere and the heroine is becoming a little unbelievable.  I liked her in the first book but find her pretty annoying in this one.  And not much about Blomqvist who was interesting in the first book.  I hope the last and third book rivals the first ~ although I am not holding out much hope that Salander will be anything less than a character not of this world.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|Finding myself groggy in adulthood, still surprised I cannot believe how fast college went by, I recall a time before I was a fan of Bob Dylan. I knew less in those days. Sheltered in my childhood born of the Protestant persuasion, most of the music I listened to was blatantly Christian for the better part of my life. I had never given much thought back then to the world outside of my innate esoteric mindset, listening mostly to bands I had no idea were usually cheap imitations of \\"the real thing.\\" After all, such strict religious confines placed around art certainly seems in hindsight to hinder creative output. Of course, to digress a bit, there are plenty of exceptions to this statement, like the band Starflyer 59 for example and early Pedro the Lion before Dave became agnostic (he is better now, check him out). At some point around the age of 18, after giving my parents the first shot of separation anxiety when I went to live at Louisiana State University, I started looking around for something more - some new musical adventure.<br /><br />Of course, Bob Dylan is a natural segue way from the world of exclusively Christian music to the realm where rock and roll happens in all of its manic apparitions. And the girl who had recently taken my innocence away was a Dylan fan herself. Her favorite album was Nashville Skyline, and she was cute - too cute for me but I got lucky as college schmucks sometimes do. Anyway, most people get into Dylan by route of the early protest songs which are all wonderful and indispensable to any songwriter or poet living today. I love those albums. I have learned from them, spending weeks listening to one over the others on rotation in a span of time which can only be called my Dylan phase, with lyrics out and dictionary open. But my path to Bob was paved by Modern Times because I had never much listened to the man before and this was the album which was coming out in stores when I finally started thinking about taking the plunge. In this way, Modern Times is my gateway drug into the universe of this man who I try not to overly lionize because being worshiped is not what Bob Dylan is all about. He's too cool to be worshiped.<br /><br />Sure, I have heard the complaint that he swiped lyrics from some Civil War poet, that he credited himself behind \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'.\\" These things do not really bother me. I am more big picture in my thinking, choosing to acknowledge that excellent Jean-Luc Godard quote: \\"It's not where you take things from - it's where you take them to.\\" Nothing is original anymore, not even Bob Dylan, but this does not imply that brilliance has died. In some ways, brilliance has never been in better shape.<br /><br />Here we have a man with something to say about our era by way of pre-rock musical accompaniment and lyrics in the thoughtful tradition of Dylan - which is to say sometimes prophetic, other times cautionary, regretful, or provocative. Something here seems new to me every time I listen to this album, even now that it is a few years old. While the album rolls on without a single clunker, favorites for me come from the latter half of the album with my favorite being \\"Nettie Moore\\" for the beautiful sorrow I hear in it. I get the impression that however strained his voice may sound on this album old Zimmy has a way of convincing the listener there is a good reason for it being so worn. And it is not simply because he is now an old man or because when he was younger he smoked \\"eighty cigarettes a day.\\" This album convinced me in my innocent musical mind that Bob Dylan was the poet seer just as much now as he ever was. Every song is excellent, and in spite of an occasional apocalyptic premonition (especially on \\"Ain't Talkin'\\") which should be welcomed by those of us skeptical of contemporary progress, Modern Times manages to create a whimsical nostalgic mood on \\"When the Deal Goes Down\\" after such a guttural rocker as the classic \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" (which everybody knows Bob didn't write, including himself I'm sure). And \\"Workingman's Blues\\" captures a sympathy for the working man which truly represents Dylan's songwriting talent because he hasn't been in the shoes of blue collar toilers in some time. Decades, actually, since he was the only living boy in New York. But what Dylan has done with his career is perhaps just as necessary and timeless as the archetype of the hard-working man who never gives up. And who else could throw the word proletariat in a song and have it sound unpretentious?<br /><br />Modern Times, to me, is an album about not giving up even if, in the end, there's nothing new to say that hasn't been said before by Dylan or Shakespeare.cluding himself I'm sure).

0525457585|5.0|the neverending story -from which the movie is based- is about the adventures of a little boy, including his travel to a fantasy realm and back. It has the message of self acceptance, dangers of decision making, character and how arrogance can lead to paths one better wished not have traveled. I really liked this book and felt sad when finished reading it. Although i love the movie, you get more personal reading the story than watching the movie, as you feel more part of it and use your own imagination to depict what is written about.
B003DZM54I|3.0|It doesn't have the most creative or poetic lyrics, to be sure, but \\"Tattoos & Tequila\\" does effectively communicate its basic message: that the singer would like an unspecified young woman to (1) take off her clothes, (2) show him her tattoos, and (3) drink his tequila. Given that the message is accompanied by suitable hard-rockin' music, \\"Tattoos & Tequila\\" is sure to become a staple of strip club DJs everywhere English is spoken.<br /><br />Edit: My comments above were made about the song \\"Tattoos & Tequila\\". Apparently, Amazon is also displaying them as if they were a review of the album by the same name.
B003DNN0L2|1.0|The first half of the movie had potential, but it just falls apart into sillyness at the end, and 'suspending your disbelief' becomes impossible, after which the movie sadly falls off a cliff.  This was definitely not a kids movie because both the language and themes where adult oriented, and it is to 'over the top' silly (especially the end) for adults, so what demographic where the producers of this movie targeting, who knows?  The story-line was pointless, and plot just silly-stupid.  I couldn't wait for the movie to end -- and when it was over, I was left thinking, \\"I wish I could have the last 2hrs of my life back\\".      If you must see it rent it, DON'T BUY IT; if you do the DVD will be a $15 coaster after you're done watching.

B000007489|4.0|ST were the great hybrid band. Part skate part punk part metal part thrash. I don't think that anyone has ever put it all together like this. There have been many imitators. But nothing comes close to the edge of this album. When this Institutionalized first came out, the video and the sound was shocking, kind of like the LA version of the Sex Pistols first coming out on the scene. The difference here is the musicianship, the guitar playing is virtuousic and the rest of the band is smoking as well. Muir's lyrics are also compelling enough that you have to listen to them as well.

B000WZAE1I|3.0|Vaughn's ambitious fantasy is something of a curate's egg. It certainly looks good, with some impressive, if uneven, special effects and an attractive, stellar cast. It will undoubtedly enchant most children and keep them entertained throughout. For me, however, it was marred by several fundamental flaws. There's some very clunky dialogue, and, in their (laudable) efforts to appeal to both kids and adults, Vaughn and Goldman have allowed themselves to indulge in some painfully laboured humour. There's also a somewhat contrived, forced feeling to the way the story progresses. This may sound like mean-spirited criticism but these problems result in a movie that has much less heart and charm than it ought to have. This is far from being a bad movie, but, with an improved script, it could have been a much better one.
B001FB5634|4.0|We are not told what destroyed the planet. I assume people did somehow. Not telling us specifics is brilliant in a way. We'd get too hung up on the cause. It is besides the point, in the end. This story is simply about the end, not it's cause.<br />I enjoyed this road trip because I find utterly fascinating the prospect of global catastrophe. The realistic or in some cases utterly fantastical imaginings of what the world would be like after a global pandemic or nuclear war or any major disaster that wipes out civilization is inherently interesting. I remember as a kid loving a cartoon called Thundarr the Barbarian and latter in life appreciated the now classic The Road Warrior and various post-apocalyptic movies.<br />This movie based on renowned novelist Cormac McCarthy's book aims to be a strictly realistic portrayal of survival of a man and his son after \\"the end\\" has come. Their story is simple, straightforward and gloomy as can be. A man and his weak little boy walk through an utterly gray, dying world of decay, sparsely populated by bands of cannibals. He had a wife (played Charlize Theron) who we see only in his dreams. She was not a good person, seems to me, but sadly many people aren't very good are they? You wouldn't expect better from them after the collapse of society. There are no animals, very little food. The man wants to reach the coast where he believes they stand a better chance of survival. There is little hope. They \\"carry the fire\\" within in a world where the lights are just about to go out. What else are you going to do. Die.<br /><br />Note: Not for adolescent ADD action junkies. I love it when people assume things about what type of movie and story they're going to watch and when it is not the type of movie they anticipated they go ahead and judge it by the standards of the type of movie they wanted it to be. In other words, no, The Road is not an action flick. But I understand people are conditioned to expect this from Hollywood.
1423101472|5.0|The Last Olympian wrapped up the Percy Jackson series wonderfully.  I found that the kids had grown from the first book and had become really great young adults.  As always, I love our trio of campers and all of the gods- good, bad, and in between.  I read this series to my son (he's 5) and he would beg me every night for, \\"Just one more chapter.\\"  It was great to have him be so excited to read and insist that I read until my voice nearly gave out each and every night.      I'll even admit that this book made me emotional.  At the end, after a character's death, I found myself unable to continue reading to my son for a moment because I was so choked up.  Rick Riordan did a fabulous job capturing that moment and relaying it to the reader.  All in all, our family truly enjoyed this series and look forward to continued works from Riordan.

B001SGEULU|2.0|The late 1990's-2000's were not a kind period for Oasis. After the bloated, if critically underrated, BE HERE NOW derailed their careers in the US, Oasis went on a hiatus to prepare a new record for the millennium. But during the production of the record, not only did the band lose two of their key founding members (Paul \\"Bonehead\\" Arthurs and Paul \\"Guigsy\\" McGuigan) but the remaining members had to re-record the parts Arthurs and McGuigan recorded to avoid legal problems. STANDING ON THE SHOULDER OF THE GIANTS, which was the album, was a murky and tedious modern psychedelic record that lacked the optimism and sense of the fun of Oasis' first two brilliant albums. The mellotrons, drum loops, keyboards, electronic devices and sitars, all these unique experiments, could not disguise the fact that the band was going through the motions. Eventually, they would find new members in Gem Archer and Andy Bell but at this time, it felt Oasis had lost their sense of direction.<br /><br />HEATHEN CHEMISTRY, the album after SHOULDER, was a tighter, more consistent and less cluttering record. But tightness does not make it better and CHEMISTRY is no more enjoyable and inspired than SHOULDER. Hyped as a return to the basics, CHEMISTRY still lacked the sense of fun of before and the album comes across being as a rehash of their previous albums. In other words, Oasis doing a pale imitation of Oasis. It's not a bad album; it's just tiring and uninspired. You get the idea that Oasis were running out of ideas or ideas on who to rip off from.<br /><br />For many years, Oasis have shamelessly (and delightfully) borrowed from other rock bands' music. Here, they seem to be borrowing their own to mixed results. \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" is a soggy sequel to \\"Don't Look Back at Anger\\"; \\"Force of Nature\\" is \\"Flashbax\\" without any ounce of energy left; \\"She is Love\\" and \\"Songbird\\" are pleasant but inconsequential retreads of \\"Half the World Away\\" and \\"Wonderwall\\"; and \\"Better Man\\", the album's closer, feels like a processed \\"Rock N Roll Star\\". Only \\"The Hindu Times\\", with its sweet, psychedelic haze and the U2-like \\"(Probably) All in My Mind\\" are redeeming values in an otherwise dull, pedestrian package.<br /><br />Although the album was a huge hit in the UK and spawned four Top ten singles there, HEATHEN CHEMISTRY was merely a transitional record and the group has since rightfully buried the album (although \\"Songbird\\" and \\"Little by Little\\" still remain concert staples and four of the songs have appeared on TIME FLIES). It was not until DON'T BELIEVE THE TRUTH that they and their music seemed rejuvenated. If you want a better example of the late renaissance of Oasis, pick that album up instead. In fact, listen to that CD and HEATHEN CHEMISTRY and it will be like listening to two different bands: one that seems to not know what to do next and the other being focused, energized and determined to play rock n' roll because they love to.<br /><br />See you next time for my next review.ls like a processed \\"Rock N Roll Star\\".

B001PPGAIA|4.0|This film is thoroughly entertaining and visually and musically stunning.  Without giving up the story, Baz Luhrmann is again operatic in his storytelling.  The most operatic scene contains a boys choir, \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" and Aboriginal chanting in the background that ties the themes of the movie together beautifully. His hero (Hugh Jackman) and heroine (Nicole Kidman) have an undeniable chemistry and it is fun to see their characters predictably come together. Hugh Jackman portrays his character with effortless vulnerability that is a joy to watch.  The child star, Brandon Walters, is enchanting.  His eyes are so soulful.  He is the most believable child actor I've ever seen on film.  If you are a sucker for a fine romance that is epic - shamelessly so - and can overlook the computer-generated effects that don't quite mesh - this is the guilty pleasure for you.
0756405890|3.0|It seems many of the raving reviewers are die-hard fantasy fans.  From the perspective of that often middling genre, I could understand why this book would be seen as a brilliant breath of fresh air.  It reads, in many ways, like a normal novel.  The author is good at not-so-subtly interjecting himself through various characters to explain to the reader why his story is different than a conventional one - why most fantasy stories would go in one direction, but he went in another.     Not being a huge fan of fantasy, that didn't really play for me since I've read enough stories in many genres that break from expectation and I did not know enough about fantasy to know to expect something different.  Perhaps that's groundbreaking for fantasy readers, but not really for the rest of us.       It is, in the end, a good and interesting story and I don't feel I wasted my time in reading it.  I would, still, recommend reading it.  But, just know what you're getting into.  There is no need for it to be as long as it is.  About 3/4 of the way through I was ready to move on to a new book, but was too invested to stop.   It was a struggle to finally finish - which frustrates me since I was so thoroughly captivated in the beginning and already recommending it to friends and family.  Now, I keep it to myself.    The vast number of obvious typos throughout suggests to me that the editor didn't even do a cursory copy edit, much less give the necessary guidance to this author in trimming and focusing the book.  Any professional editor who misses that many typos should be fired.  That individual is in the wrong profession.      *SPOILER* *SPOILER*       I respect that the author was trying something new with pacing for a fantasy novel, and perhaps part of the allure of this book is that this epic hero ultimately lives like the rest of us - college admissions, getting a loan, signing up for classes, paying tuition (yes - all major plot points).  The obsession with highlighting the financial value of every transaction throughout gets rather tedious, but I guess it plays to author's attempt to take the fantasy genre into a very real place.  I respect that choice, but it just doesn't make for compelling reading all the time.     For, in the end, the arc of a story must still exist.  It has been there for thousands upon thousands of years and will need to be there so long as people tell stories.  This book more often reads as a series of events strung together.      When Kvothe wanders off to investigate a wedding in a completely new town and runs into a big dragon-like creature who had not been hinted at or introduced prior, it was hard to care.  This showdown was not a culmination of his learning or a climactic gathering of all the events that had come prior.  It was simply another interlude.      The end of the book illustrates this frustration as well - rather than deftly pulling together all the plots, it simply uses the mechanism of a series of small chapters to explain what happened for each plot thread.      There's some brilliant prose in here - lines that really should live on for eternity in literature.  When I'd come across the great prose, I'd find myself pining for a lost friend - since it tended to show up in the beginning and the end.   But great prose does not a great story make.  It was a good effort, but not quite there yet.

B001P9KR8U|2.0|I know many people rate this movie very highly, but all I can say is . . . WHY? Yes, it is well made and, yes, the acting is good, but it was horrible to see the suffering and degradation the characters went through. After I saw it, I felt upset and revolted, and the feeling persisted even into the following day, which gives you an indication of just how depressing this movie is. I would never, ever watch this movie again, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone. In fact, I feel like I need to go take a shower now to wash off all the \\"yuck\\" just thinking about it.

B0021L8V1G|3.0|Iron Man 2 is a huge step down from the first movie. To be fair, it is still pretty entertaining, but in many ways it is like The Incredible Hulk, except it goes in the opposite direction. Where that movie improved on Hulk in many ways(mainly by embracing the Marvel Universe), this film ends up being of comparable quality, but by comparison to the first film it is a huge let down.<br /><br />Actually, in a lot of ways it's a huge let down. There really isn't a conflict to speak of, outside of a few plot contrivances. Tony Stark is dying. Except he's not really dying, as it seems everyone and their brother has a way to fix his problem. Tony Stark has some corporate rivals. Except they're jokes, never really threatening in any way. Tony Stark has someone who has a grudge against him, someone's who might be as brilliant as Tony in a darker way. Except their confrontations are both resolved in anticlimactic moments of action. Moments, at best.<br /><br />The whole problem with the film is that it is all tell and no show. Tony Stark famously says that he has privatized world peace. Except we never see anything close to him actually doing that. In the first film we got a tease of Iron Man fighting warlords and terrorists. Here, we get magazine covers and people talking about vague accomplishments of Iron Man, saying that he's \\"on watch,\\" but we never see any of it. Then Tony has a breakdown later in the film, a drunken brawl with his friend. Nick Fury shows up and says he's been neglecting his duty and causing messes for Fury to clean up. Except, again, we see no neglect, we see no mess.<br /><br />All in all, there are only really 2 action sequences in the entire film. The first, the famous racecar showdown, is great. Legitimately great. Until it becomes a joke where John Faverau makes himself the big hero. The second big sequence is decent, but it is overly dark, and when it's time to be over it's just over. Iron Man whips out a couple of super weapons and ends the battle in seconds.<br /><br />All in all, the problem, to my mind, seems that Faverau wanted to just let the characters riff on each other, eating up screen time cheaply and spending his money on really big but not very exciting action sequences.<br /><br />That said, there are the elements of a great film here. All the returning actors are great(except Faverau himself, who is just a series of bad jokes in a part that is inexplicably prominent), and Rockwell and Rourke are fantastic as the new villains. Rockwell is hilariously smarmy and annoying, playing an arms dealer who wants to be unscrupulous and underground, but isn't really up to being as threatening or evil as he wants to be. Rourke brings a nice quiet intelligence and menace to his role, playing well off of Rockwell and Downey. I'm actually quite glad that Faverau isn't that involved in The Avengers, as this movie just seems like an exercise in filmmaking excess. And not even the good kind of excess, that involves over-blown action sequences.l in all, the problem, to my mind, seems that Faverau wanted to just let the characters riff on each other, eating up screen time cheaply and spending his money on really big but not very exciting action sequences.

B003MXLUBU|5.0|I was frustrated to hear that the Stones had reissued (yet again) \\"Exile...\\" and this time put out bonus tracks. I wanted the previously unreleased material, but I already had a remastered \\"Exile\\" (second time purchased since CDs replaced Vinyl and Cassettes) and I DID NOT want to rebuy it again. No problem, this Bonus Tracks Only version was just what I needed. The 10 additional tracks are a remarkable \\"sequel\\" to one of the three (in my opinion) greatest all time Stones albums. Some of the songs even top a few of the album tracks that made it onto \\"Exile\\" (not that anything on \\"Exile\\" is substandard, it's just that these outtakes might even be better).  The piano by the late Nicky Hopkins is nicely showcased on this collection and puts a footnote on the greatest session man of all time's contribution to the Stones' legacy. Fans of this funky Mussel Shoals period MUST have this CD. If you don't already have a remastered Exile, get the double CD edition, but if you do, this Bonus Tracks Only CD is what you want.
0066620996|5.0|This book is very well written and easy to understand with an outline following each chapter to summarize the contents of each chapter.   Although I have not implemented the policies in the book (as I do not have a business),  Collins'  arguments are made with strong evidence and anecdotes on what he has designated the \\"Good to Great Companies\\"  and how they have gone from good companies to companies that far surpass their competitors.  His concepts are well presented in appropriate easy to understand graphs, charts, and diagrams.        I have also been convinced by this book, that the most famous and charismatic CEOs are not the best because once these CEOs are gone there is no one to replace them.  A probable current and relevant (not mentioned in the book) example of this could be Steve Jobs who founded Apple computer and got kicked off in the 1980s only for the company to struggle along until Jobs returned as the CEO of Apple. Currently Apple seems to have soared into success, but the question is what will happen when Jobs leaves or retires ?      Although the book is excellent in most respects, in recent days some of the good to great companies  have seen financial trouble such as Fannie Mae and Circuit City.  Despite this I still recommend this book and in fact these forementioned issues are supposed to (I have not read the book yet) be addressed in Collins' fairly recent book \\"How the Mighty Fall\\" (2009).
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Earth is overrun with garbage and is uninhabitable.  WALL-E's job is to compact garbage and stack it into towers (WALL-E = Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class).  He spends his night finding uses for interesting items he finds during the day and watching the musical, \\"Hello Dolly.\\"  although he is a robot, the monotony, isolation, and loneliness show on his little robot face.<br /><br />Then, a visitor.  EVE is left there by a spacecraft, apparently on a scouting mission, but what is she looking for? WALL-E's attempts to befriend her are futile - she's on a mission! EVE spots one of WALL-E's finds and that's when the real adventure begins.<br /><br />Fast forward to The Axiom: Weeble-like people in a uniform, commercialized world, drinking their meals in a cup.  This is a world where everyone and everything literally stays within the lines (ON the line, to be exact). WALL-E becomes an unlikely hero for those who choose to not stay on the line.<br /><br />This movie is well done: touching, funny with a clever plot, and it is a great movie to watch with your kids.  They will love the pretty colors and the slapstick comedy (WALL-E and other characters fall and bump into things a lot).  Plus, there's an interesting enough storyline and humor (and pretty colors) to keep the adults interested.<br /><br />After seeing this movie, I regret having not seen it in a theatre - watching the DVD at home did not do the amazing visuals justice. It's Pixar, so I expected superior graphics and they did not disappoint.  At the beginning of the movie, there's not much dialogue, which made the soundtrack all the more important.  Most of the music is by Thomas Newman and it is at times sweeping, whimsical, airy, and jazzy. Well done!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie and give it four out of five stars.
B001C08RHA|5.0|When I first rented this movie I wasn't impressed.Then I watched Sherlock Holmes and I realized how much I like  Robert Downey Jr.  So I went to rent it again, and the video store didn't have it.  People rented it and just kept it and paid for it, so I had to buy it to watch it again, and now I love it, I think it is a great movie

0061122416|5.0|I am generally considered to be a \\"serious\\" person. Although perhaps preferable to being \\"flighty,\\" there are advantages to each trait. The Alchemist provides a vista for achieving equilibrium in amphitheaters where one seeks buoyancy. It did for me. It is a simple story with an uncomplicated style which some consider to be childish. Possibly, for some of us, viewing our world with more of a sense of adventure and fascination might not be such a bad approach.

B001OQCV6K|5.0|Loved this on Blu-Ray. I actually thought it was better at home on my blu-ray than at the theatre. I am very tempted from now on just to buy blu-rays and skip the theatre-its the same price. Loved the banter between Robert Downey Jr. & Jude Law. Got Sherlock Holmes on Blu-ray actually for the fighting sequences and the slow motion so I could catch more of it. Was AWESOME!!!
1439148953|5.0|Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is one of the best Irish writers working nowadays. Ireland is a country of great writers, and he doesn't shame his antecessors. His latest novel, \\"Brooklyn\\", is a story that could be part of Joyce's \\"Dubliners\\" or William Trevor's collected stories. But, at the same time, the book fells fresh, different and not a copycatted narrative. It is because T&oacute;ib&iacute;n owns his own literary voice, so beautiful, so deep.<br /><br />\\"Brooklyn\\" is a story about the sense of not belonging - as well as, the sense of finding your place in the world. These quests bring along deep identity questioning. The main character is Eilis, an Irish girl for whom there aren't many opportunities available. It is nothing short of a miracle when a priest invites her to move to New York, and work as clerk.<br /><br />As life changes for her, Eilis discovers new feelings and emotions. The very first one, when the excitement vanishes, is homesickness. \\"She had been keeping the thought of home out of her mind, letting it come to her only when she wrote or received letters\\". T&oacute;ib&iacute;n brings to the narrative the character's deepest feelings with easiness and beauty. As he displayed in \\"The Master\\", a novel about Henry James, the author deals with honesty and knowledge the question of emigration - living in a foreign country.<br /><br />Eilis is a stranger in a strange land. Knowing only one person - the priest who helps her - she has to find new friends and even a boyfriend. For less attentive readers, nothing much seems to happen in \\"Brooklyn\\", because this is the inner story of a girl. But one doesn't have to dig too deep to realize the beauty and complexity of this novel.<br /><br />This is a story of simple people - lives with no glamour or anything like that - the beauty of it resides in the simplicity of their lives. No characters wants to become the president of the world or anything as megalomaniacal as that. They want to live their simple lives with dignity, love and money to buy foods and some comfort. T&oacute;ib&iacute;n finds in these unglamorous acts the sparkle of the everyday life.n finds in these unglamorous acts the sparkle of the everyday life.
030726999X|5.0|Steig Larsson's death is a great loss, read all three of his books in order.  He kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, could not put them down until my eyes blurred.  Larsson takes the reader on a wild and wonderful ride, a must read for all mystery lovers.  You will not be dissapointed!
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I collect movie scores, especially scores with epic battle scenes and music.  When I discovered Invincible it quickly became on my favorite CDs.  It ranks right up there with 300 and The Dark Knight for me.  Get this music!  You won't regret it!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Great movie.  Amazon delivered very quickly and had a great price.  Note to Wal-Mart dvd/blu-ray buyers - save your receipt.  Twice I've purchased movies, got it home and opened the case to find it empty (no disc).  You get quite a look from the customer service dept. when returning an empty dvd case.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|You all know the cast is All-Star. The fact that they all sing their own parts with no `Ghost Singers' makes this romp based on Abba songs all the better. And by the way, Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski can sing, and I mean very very well.<br /><br />The music, the scenery, the scenarios...all very excellent. And people, every actor/actress here can SING. While some think the `Dancing Queen' sequence is great, I think the Dancing Guys In Flippers (only 30 seconds long) is hilarious.<br /><br />The choreography is superb. The music is great, and the whole thing is just fun.<br /><br />The plot? Simple. A young girl invites three men (Firth, Brosnan, and Skarsgard) who are totally different, to her wedding. One of them, she believes, is her father. Her mother (Streep) had `encounters' with each. And each man, in return, believes himself to be the daughter he never knew of. Because of this, each man is transformed. Simple, and enough of the plot.<br /><br />The movie is about the incredible music and dance sequences. Enjoy this film for that simple fact. I know I did.<br /><br />And by the way, the movie is freaking funny.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Just buy it! Picture is much more colorful after the restoration!  The extra special features are nice too.
B001VEHZZ2|1.0|The book has an interesting way of being delivered: first person, where the narrator is speaking to an unidentified stranger. We learn a lot about him and others, and learn of his life.     However, we also learn that this guy, who got educated in the States and earned a nice living working for a U.S. company, apparently hates America: how else do you explain \\"when I saw the (World Trade Center) towers fall (9/11), I smiled.\\" That got to me. I continued on, hoping that surely he would tell us how he was wrong, but no ... never happened.     It ends with us wondering if he's about to murder his companion (the unidentified stranger).     If you hate America, you'll love this book; otherwise, I recommend that you pass.
B000AGTPUK|3.0|This seller provided me with a perfect copy of the movie BUT the movie is just not a great movie. I bought it to add to my holiday movie collection and was disappointed. It puts the kids to sleep. Just not that great. Tom Hanks puts them out.
B0013D8LOK|2.0|So bad, what a joke. The actors are great ACTORS but not singers and there is just too much singing! If you like movies that sing 98% of the time instead of talking (like Rent), you will love this - we did not. Too bad that with such great acting and great sets and costumes, they had to muck it up with entirely too many songs and too little dialogue in between. This R rated scary movie musical really failed. The special effects also lacked, the spurting blood looked pretty fake - we just could not take it seriously. We were afraid it woud be too scary to watch, but we laughed throughout the entire thing. We would really love to see this re-written without the singing.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|\\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" received such rave reviews that against the usual, I bought the book straight-out rather than trying a Kindle sample. And I was very annoyed after attempting to read the first chapter of the first book in the series many, many times. It opens on a court case I don't understand with a character I've \\"never met,\\" and I kept thinking, \\"whuh?\\"<br /><br />Once I committed to just FINISHING the first chapter and then entered the second, the story flew. In the end, I'm glad that I came in late. I was able to enjoy the complete series one after another. It is a gem. I appreciate that it's a thriller that isn't Ameri-centric. I thoroughly enjoyed the smart attitude and surprises throughout. And the translator, Reg Keeland, did an exceptional job.<br /><br />Loved it, loved it, beginning (after all) to end. The only problem? After enjoying a solid week with Mikael and Lisbeth. I fear suffering Character Withdrawal.
B001FB563E|5.0|Don't watch the preview that's shown above in the Amazon preview section. I saw it before renting the movie (which is great, by the way). That \\"preview\\" is the freaking ending. Holy crap, talk about ruining the movie for you. But anyway, this is a great movie. Very depressing, though...
0446563048|5.0|I was lucky enough to get a pre-review copy (thanks everyone at Zappos/Delivering Happiness), enjoy the book and interview Tony. I have to say, this certainly falls into the category of must-read books for every entrepreneur.<br /><br />Why? Because this isn't a \\"How To\\" book or another run-of-the-mill business book. It is based on real experiences, a fantastic story, and takeaways that will make you think and probably alter the way you do business (I know it did for me).<br /><br />I love how the book isn't formal and stuff, but instead written in Tony's words. It is like having a cup of coffee with him for the price of just a few cups. Now that is invaluable.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|Asia is back with another winnner! This cd is hard to find!  The only place I could find it was at Amazon.com!You cannot find it at Best Buy or any other cd stores. There are not many places left to find music so as always Amazon saves the day!  Now for the music, I have always been a fan of Asia since their first album.  I always believed that the original band was by far the best!  These guys are really getting better with age.  I really loved the Phoenix cd when it came out but I think this is even better! It is one of those rare cds you can hit the play button and just let it play without any regrets.  My favorite songs are \\"Ever Yours\\", \\"Listen Children\\", \\"Emily\\", \\"Don't Wanna Lose You Now\\"!  But the song I keep listening to is \\"I'm Still The Same\\"  This great song starts out with these weird keyboards and launches into the best song on the cd.  It has really great lyrics and a kind of Beatles sound to it! So if you are a fan of the orginal lineup of John Wetton,Geoff Downes, Steve Howe, and Carl Palmer you should order this cd as soon as you read this!  You will be glad you did. I also played this for my 22 and 17 year old daughters and they really enjoyed it.  Buy  this now and enjoy some really great music!! Once you put it into your cd tray you will leave it in for a long time.
B000002OAZ|5.0|This whole cd is just great. You wont be sorry if you buy it. This is like one of my all time favorite music selections. My other one was scratched from so much playing so I am actually just replacing it. It is the blues music and I put this one better then Stevie Ray.
B0017CW5J4|5.0|I have this DVD and like it a lot. I bought a blu-ray for best quality.  There is nobody who does not like because it's fun.  If you are looking for a show that pleases all ages and people, this is one. Very good audio and production.
0671027344|3.0|I thought this book was just okay. It's about a boy's first year in high school. It's written as a series of letters that he writes to an unknown receiver, talking about everything that is going on in his life. It's a very quick, easy read. I think I may be too old for it. Maybe an adolescent would enjoy it. I'm thirty and I felt that he seemed so incredibly young and the hiw writing in the letters seemed so elementary, despite that fact that one of his teachers tells him he's brilliant. The character is a little bit annoyingly corny and too happy go-lucky at times and also cries way too much. I hate to make such an obvious comparison, but I was hoping to enjoy it in a similar way to \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" It can be interesting to read about a smart adolescent coming of age, observing things for the first time, and experiencing things with new perspective. However, I did not feel that way at all about this book. I really shouldn't even compare the two. That was my mistake. They are nothing alike. There is nothing profound or interesting about the way the main character Charlie sees things. I was disappointed in this book.
B000I5XDXS|5.0|Guaranteed fun!<br />If you are looking for a show that pleases all ages and people, this is one. Very good audio and music; Selection is great!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This brought back memories from my twenties and college years. This concert is actually a couple of years old but the DVD and CD are great. The set was a gift for my wife for Mother's Day and we both appreciated it. We couldn't make it to one of the Troubador concerts live, but this was a great substitute.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|A great idea for a film, executed well, with plenty of \\"wow\\" moments: Jimmy Page standing in the hallway where John Bonham recorded drums for \\"When the Levee Breaks\\", the Edge showing what the riff to \\"Elevation\\" sounds like with and without effects, and plenty more.    And then we have Jack White. While talented, he simply hasn't earned his place at this table. His self-absorbed posturing gets old immediately, and he isn't the visionary that Page and Edge are--there are no \\"wow\\" moments with White. He's treading recycled blues territory that Page and countless others already explored decades ago, and acts like he discovered it first.    There are so many other guitarists that would make a worthy complement to Page and Edge, and have a body of groundbreaking work to back it up, that I have to think the only reason for bringing White into this movie was to broaden the demographic scope, and obtain the most viewers: Page = Boomers, Edge = Gen X, White = Millennials.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book so much! It kept me up all night, there was never a boring part. I liked it better then Twilight because there are so many vampire romances out there but only one Hunger Games.
030745455X|1.0|This book is EXACTLY like shopping at IKEA! The reader is left to wander around through some idiot's idea of a \\"well designed\\" commercial adventure, VERY SLOWLY. When I finally arrived at the initial, \\"gripping\\" murder, I gave up. I just didn't care that those folks were dead. Mr. Larsson must force your attention through a cluttered and meandering plot by giving you no options to do anything else but browse. I have been to IKEA twice, and bought NOTHING. I tried to order some cheap chairs from them once- they were out of stock and never, ever replenished...just like this book. It gave me nothing, so I put it down and walked away.<br /><br />I read 1 and wondered what all the fuss was about. Larsson actually pinpointed his own prosaic banality by liberally admitting that his main character read BETTER authors. (Go, Val McDermid!) Read it if you need something to put you to sleep-the highly touted \\"shocker\\" scenes are TAME, really, kiddie torture porn! Yawn!<br /><br />Run screaming from 2 if you have any emotions at all, because unless you like IKEA and microwave pizza, there is nothing else worth fantasizing about in this craptastic novel!<br /><br />I had to look up Billy's Pizza-just to see- and, yes, you can buy it, frozen, at most convenience stores in Sweden. Yum!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|When I first heard they were adapting L.J. Smith's \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" I worried we'd be watching \\"Twilight\\" 2.0. Elena was no longer blonde, she was the Bella-like brunette Nina Dobrev, Paul Wesley looked suspiciously like RPattz, and where the heck did Meredith go? Nevertheless, I set myself down on Thursday night to see if I'd accept or reject this new addition to the vampire craze.    The first episode almost blew me away. The writing was smart and interesting. The lighting was almost otherworldly. Okay, the fog machines were a bit much, but when Stefan's face changed I felt chills run down my spine. I wanted keep watching. By the fourth episode, though, some of the splendor wore off. All that kept happening was biting and teenagers in love.    As if in answer to my waning interest, BAM! The show changed from teenagers to a show about a town. A town steeped in mystery with supernatural lore and background so intoxicating, I found myself wondering why each episode wasn't longer. And the story... I have never seen a story move so fast in one season. They had materials for about two and a half seasons of a show, which I would have watched but probably not loved. Events move quickly in \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" and they all make sense. In every episode at least one question is resolved, only to have about three other questions asked. There is never a dull moment.    Surprising me further was my interest in the characters. I don't think I've ever in my life watched a show where I liked every single person in it, even the \\"bad guys/girls.\\" I started out annoyed with Elena's little brother Jeremy (Steven McQueen), but he evolved so well by the end of the season I couldn't even remember why I'd disliked him in the first place.    Nina Dobrev was worth the hair color change: she is in one scene the confident, good-natured, mature Elena Gilbert, and in the next the vindictive, heartless, terrifying Katherine Pierce. She alone is worth watching the show for, but there's alsothe amazing Ian Somerhalder as Damon Salvatore. Throughout the first season Damon changes from the guy who kills everybody to the guy who saves everybody, and he's so convincing I'd nominate him for an Emmy if a CW show was ever actually considered. I could go on and on about each actor's performance, every single one standing out brilliantly, but then this review would last about ten pages.    It's definitely not Twilight, it's not True Blood, it's a vampire show that stands on its own.
B0039TD7PY|3.0|You buy this because you remember them. King's voice is very thin and she can't make the notes but its fun to listen to
B0006SSOHC|4.0|This is probably the best one of the series.<br /><br />It's a very gory and realistic movie in terms of visuals. It will make your stomach turn and your hand will cover your face in shock and disgust.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|I love this CD...I think it is the best Norah Jones CD yet.  I love her soothing voice.
B0035G9ABQ|3.0|I'm a huge Gorillaz fan so when I saw this on Amazon I thought, heck yes! Then I listened to it. Its not really Gorillaz music in that all the songs they have have special guests. So you don't get to hear 2Ds voice or anything. The music is also way different from anything else they've done and in my opinion is almost as bad as Gorillaz vs. The Space Monkeys. It also comes in a paper case which worried me about becoming scratched on the shipment over, but luckily it wasn't. If your a die hard Gorillaz fan then by all means get it. I will, however, stand by my decision that its not that great of a CD and I could have been better off not getting it.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|The  Garmin Forerunner 305 is just as good apparently, but i didn't want to carry something so large (trying to go with less).  The 405CX I got is a bit of a pain, in that it is smaller, and hard to see the dial in the bright sun as well as the shade.  It also has a bezel that you run your finger around to change the menu choices, but it gets activated when you bump it lightly.  Not that sensitivity is a bad thing, since a lot of touch devices lack sensitivity.  The only thing that keeps the bezel from totally ruining things is that you can lock it right after you start a run, so that it won't get tapped or stopped.  The larger garmin would be my choice if I weren't looking for something less obvious.  The menus are hard to scroll through due again to the over-sensitivity of the bezel, but after a bit of use, you can navigate through all the minor miss-taps.  The rechargeable battery so far has held a charge over the course of a couple of days.  Some reviews had said that the GPS being on drains power, but I haven't see that happen.  Perhaps with the CX Garmin has included an auto-off function for the GPS.  The virtual partner is nice, and you can set it so that the screens scroll between the virtual partner and the timer/distance screens.  It isn't clear to me whether the size of the display numbers can be adjusted, but it is tough to see so small numbers, which would be a plus for the 305.  Garmin Connect is excellent.  The auto-transfer works great with my Mac on Leopard.  After I go for a run, as soon as I get near the computer, it does the data transfer automatically (once I set it up).  You can opt for using just the on-line Connect, or you can also download an application for Mac or PC that will sync with the on-line version.  The mapping functions are great.  I think Garmin has worked quite a bit on the software to make it user-friendly.  You can easily share your data with a trainer or friend, as each workout has a specific http address associated with it.The GPS is very accurate, and so far hasn't had any problems reading my runs under a running path that is totally tree lined.  I did a run out in the middle of nowhere last week, and it found satellites easily.  So in wrapping up, I would say that if you don't mind a large object on your wrist, the 305 is cheaper and does the same thing as the 405CX.  The 405CX looks like a watch, and can be used as such and no one would know the difference.  If you have bad eyesight, the 405CX is definitely hard to see.  With the bezel locked, I was unable to use the backlight while running through a really shady area.  I don't know who runs at night, but if the idea is to improve being able to see the dial in shadey areas, it needs some work.  If you would like to e-mail me directly, you can do so here:  [...]
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I bought this not expecting too much since it is a blu-ray DVD combo pack and I wasn't disappointed. There are no special features on either disc. That being said, its still a great movie and since I'm the only one in my family that has a Blu-ray player, it was nice giving them the DVD. Its also a really swell price for what you get. If your the type of person that likes having all the special features and behind the scenes stuff don't get this. If you want just the movie at a decent price then this is your best offer.  I will add one more caution. If you don't mind being patient, I've heard rumors of this movie being rereleased this year with new footage. So if you don't mind waiting, I'd wait for that.
6305161879|5.0|I first watched \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" in about 1990 on a VHS tape. A lady friend at the time said is was very funny and I was sure to like it. Well, I think that set up some resistance and it took about a third of the movie to finally win me over. But win me over, it did. What an astonishing and absurd comedy! John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and all of the supporting cast are wonderful. The writing is exceptionally good. It's a fun movie to watch in a rich subtle way and the laughs are plentiful and deep in the old British comedy tradition.<br /><br />My wife and I now have the DVD and we've watched it twice and enjoyed it both times. This movie is amazing. Watch it and enjoy. When the memory somewhat fades, watch it again. It's a movie that can be repeated over and over.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B001ESYAJY|5.0|CD arrived very fast, even before expected date. In great condition.  Thanks for a great shopping experience!
B0015XHQTY|4.0|My wife and I picked up a couple Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry Series movies at a local discount DVD rack last week. Out selections were \\"Dirty Harry\\" and \\"The Enforcer,\\" which we watched last night. We enjoyed both movies, but of the two we liked \\"Dirty Harry\\" the best.<br /><br />In \\"The Enforcer,\\" Eastwood again presents the I'll-do-it-my-way San Francisco police inspector, this time teamed with a woman partner, and he's fun to watch. This time, the bad guys involve a group of domestic terrorists out to rob the city of San Francisco and gain a few million dollars by capturing the mayor and holding him hostage for ransom. Somehow, the whole scheme just doesn't ring true. Hopefully, we're through the days of little liberation armies. Maybe it was more believable when the movie came out, but it seems now very dated. Anyway, the bad guys are really bad and Dirty Harry manages to bring them to justice in the most violent of ways. It's a fun, if unrealistic, movie to watch but it has a rather depressing ending. Both my wife and I preferred \\"Dirty Harry.\\"<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B002ZB26AO|5.0|To this point, there is much we don't know about North Korea and its totalitarian regime.  But with Barbara Demick's \\"Nothing To Envy\\", a pretty vivid, disturbing, and eye-opening perspective is provided.    Ms. Demick tracks the lives of six North Koreans - all from different walks of life - who eventually defected to South Korea.  In recounting their tales, the true horror of life under the Kim regime (father and son) becomes very apparent.  Every aspect of life is driven towards pleasing the regime, to the point that the lines between government and religion is blurred.  It is really what the communist/totalitarian mindset strives for, and in largely cutting North Korea off from the rest of the world, the Kim regime was able to evolve to this level.      The defectors have no sense of what is going on in the rest of the world, much less what is happening between towns and villages within North Korea.  Then as the famine of the 1990's sets in, we see through the eyes of these men and women the horror of having to try to sacrifice and try to survive in an environment where their individual lives were all but meaningless in the eyes of the regime.  Through the tale of a doctor, we also see the difficulty of trying to care for people with little to no supplies - even to the point of being in ethical dilemmas about personal survival versus patient survival.  Then Ms. Demick expertly charts how these men and women came to the realization that they needed to escape, how they did it, and the shock of transition to modern civilization.    I was really quite riveted by this book, and found it as compelling as other books I have read about historical atrocities in other nations.  With the events currently taking place on the Korean peninsula, Ms. Demick's \\"Nothing To Envy\\" has almost become required reading to gain some insight into the desperate situation within the totalitarian Kim regime.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|Pink's energy, talent and variety are all displayed in this concert video.  I am a big fan of rock concerts that not only display talent but also provide a great visual show (I am a big KISS fan).  Her whole entourage is also very talented.  Extremely energetic and full of energy!!!
0307266303|2.0|If you can make it past the author's annoying exaggerations and claims that he presents as facts, you can finish this book!<br /><br />Your supreme test will be chapter 25, his \\"running shoes are the runners worst enemy and barefoot running is the only way to go\\" chapter. In that chapter, it is so obvious how hard he wants the reader to buy into this idea that running shoes are bad. I have been running competitively in running shoes for 30+ years and have fortunately only had a handful of short-lived injuries. I attribute it to the avoidance of overstriding, something I learned early in my running career which has become a cardinal rule for me [Interestingly enough, I learned this by reading training quotes from the Oregon coaches, including Bill Bowerman]. McDougall does allude to the avoidance of overstriding being key, but he claims that the only way to achieve it is to run without any cushioning. False. McDougall also cites foot strength as being important when it comes to avoiding injury, but he gives the impression that running barefoot is the only way to strengthen your feet. False. Running barefoot is A way to strengthen your feet, but it can also be achieved in running shoes (e.g., toe raises daily on an incline has worked great for me over 20+ years).<br /><br />The author does entertain with nice descriptions of races, but his claims of who the greatest runners are and what the greatest races are can only be classified as one person's opinions. Who says you have to run ultras to be considered a great runner? Who says that the people who compete in ultras are better athletes than those who compete in shorter races? Ultras may or may not be worthwhile endeavors for people wanting to do great things in distance running. Consider the magnitude of people who have been inspired by Frank Shorter, Bill Rodgers, Rob de Castella, Alberto Salazar, Ron Hill, Sebastian Coe, Eamonn Coghlan, Craig Virgin, and Bruce Fordyce, just to name a few. Not all of these are ultramarathoners, yet they have inspired me to run my best, regardless of the race distance.<br /><br />This book can be somewhat entertaining, as long as the reader does not put too much stock in the author's misguided assertions.they have inspired me to run my best, regardless of the race distance.

B002SAUCBC|1.0|By the time I finally got to the finish line, I felt like I just took the long walk myself. The story was drawn out and bland. I know this is obviously not the popular opinion here, but this was not one of my favorites. I couldn't wait to just be done with it.

B00005CDNJ|5.0|Abba is a very underrated music group.  Not to say that they weren't hugely succesful and that they didn't have major hits.  They certainly did.  But the hits were so huge they often overpowered the brilliance of each album they released.  When listening to a greatest hits collection you miss out on the total true artistry of this musical group.  Thet were famous when dance music was in its prime and that is what many of their hits were.  But they were also superb at pop-rock and their albums had no filler and were all definite cohesive works with underlying messages.<br /><br />Abba was a swedish group and consisted of two married couples.  Their were problems in the interpersonal relationships at the time of SUPER TROUPER and rather than make for a lackluster release it raised the bar with music about love, relartionships, loss and friendship.  There is a purity and beauty to their music.  SUPER TROUPER was their second to last release and considered their best release by many including me.  The biggest single here THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL is a beautiful, heart-wrenching ballad and sets the tone for the whole set.  Whether optimistic, thought provoking or melancholy these songs are all superb.  The title track, ON AND ON AND ON and ME AND I are all excellent.  The slower tracks do rule here and are timeless - HAPPY NEW YEAR, OUR LAST SUMMER and THE WAY OLD FRIENDS DO show a more mature thoughtful Abba.  The trend on this release is much more in the pop-rock category.  Only LAY ALL YOUR LOVE ON ME is a traditional Abba dance track and it fits in perfectly.<br /><br />Abba is a group where greatest hits collections are great but each individual album should in no way be ignored.  Much of their best work will be missed and this group had a bigger message and purpose than hits colections show.  Pure raw talent and musicianship reign here.  This cd is poignant and resonates perfectly, standing the true test of time being in no way dated.  The digital remastering is superb and sound clarility impeccable.  Packaging is also very inventive and a large booklet of liner notes and pictures is enclosed.  There are also two superb bonus tracks.  I highly recommend this cd.  You will be doing yourself such a treat to delve deeper into the musical history of Abba.  And your music collection will thank you.rb and sound clarility impeccable.

0812973992|2.0|Let The Great World Spin was published last year to rave reviews. Descriptions included magical, sweeping, brilliant, poignant and the perfect New York novel. I am definitely out of step when it comes to current fiction because I missed the magic here - finding this book more style than substance.    The book is a set of vignettes chronicling a loosely connected set of Manhattanites in August of 1974. In the background are the Vietnam War, Nixon's resignation and Phillipe Petit- a man who stretched a cable between the World Trade Twin Towers - 103 stories up in the air - and went for a stroll - successfully.     Our cast includes two Irish brothers; one a catholic priest, who lives among and befriends a pack of heroin addicted prostitutes; a grieving mother who lost her son in the Vietnam War; and a young married couple trying to break into the NY art world in between cocaine binges. Not the most original or creative set of characters, but with a good story to guide them great novels are made. Unfortunately, and this is the biggest fault I had with Let The Great World Spin, the author doesn't tell us their stories - he explains them. Therefore the characters never became real to me - just their dialogue seemed surreal - and the narrative simply overwhelmed any and all of the underlying stories.     Think of watching a movie sitting next to someone who has seen it before and feels the need to keep whispering in your ear - detailing plot twists and characters' actions. At some point you simply want to yell, \\"Shut up!\\" I had the same experience/frustration reading this book, hoping - vainly - that the author would remove himself from the narrative. I know I'm in the minority here - but pass on this one.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Rachel Brice leads you through several fabulous Yoga routines designed to help condition you for belly dance, including an ending routine to relax you afterward.  She explains the ten points of belly dance posture to ensure correct body alignment.  The drills that she teaches are great, and you are sure to enjoy them! Drills include leg strengthening drills, isolation drills, and shimmy drills.  She gives valuable advice on back bending,   a lesson on foot patterns, arm patterns, music beats, and Yoga breathing.  She teaches 2 choreographies; one of which is peppy and fun, to Balkan style music; the other to a sultry, slow piece entitled Whisper Hungarian in My Ear.  Each choreography has a performance, demo, step-by-step instruction and practice loops.  I particularly like the slow choreography simply because I have always loved the slow fluid movements and beautiful music.  This is an intermediate to advanced DVD, but I would recommend it to beginners for the valuable explanations and conditioning exercises, not to mention having something to aspire to.  I really enjoy this DVD.
B00169N0BK|5.0|I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this device.  I also read through the reviews on CNet and Amazon for the limited number of devices that compete with the ColorMunki at this price point.  The ColorMunki is hands down the best device for the money.  Having bought LaCie 10-bit monitors I was tempted to go with the LaCie Blue Eye, but it can't calibrate printers (or projectors). I also considered the Spyder  3 Elite, but as nice as it is, again it does nothing for printers.  So if I wanted to calibrate not only monitors, but printers too, only the ColorMunki was left at less than $1200.<br /><br />So I gritted my teeth and bought the ColorMunki Photo, expecting the worst.  To my surprise it is incredibly easy to set up and use.  I've used it on a variety of Macs and PCs and had NOT ONE problem with it.<br /><br />I love this device and am very glad to own it!

B002AOWXO0|4.0|Here we have an album of duets by Pete Yorn and Scarlett Johansson.  It is said to have been recorded in 2006, although it wasn't released until 2009.  If you didn't like Scarlett's [[ASIN:B0014IH1N6 solo album]] (and many didn't), don't let that stop you from buying this one.  It's actually good.
1401323820|5.0|I love the tv show, CASTLE, and the producers have come out with one of the books mentioned on the show written by the Nathan Fillion character Richard Castle based on his muse, Kate Beckett, his Police woman partner, played by Stana Katic!  They also are coming out with the other book from the script in September!  This makes the whole show more real and ties the story line together!
B000YABYLA|4.0|I don't know what I was expecting with this one, but it turns out that it's quite good. It's not really a movie about teen pregnancy - that just forms the backdrop. It's more about Juno's journey through these nine months of her life, how she experiences things, how and what she learns, etc. It's not quite a romantic comedy, but it's definitely not a drama, and it's not something sappy. It's quirky, and overall it's positive and fun. Feel-good but also serious, a little odd, and interesting to watch. No boredom here.<br /><br />Ellen Page does a good job - a cynical, slightly strange teen. Supporting parts by J.K. Simonds, Allison Janney and Jennifer Garner are very well done, good solid perfomances. Jason Bateman's role is a little less well done, but he basically plays a guy who won't grow up, which he does well.<br /><br />I'd give it a good solid 8 (out of 10), and it's something I'd watch again.
B001LXIDVS|4.0|I don't know if a lot of people know this but at the very end of Back to the Future Part II there was a full trailer for Part III, I guess they didn't want to keep you too anticipated because of Part II's cliffhanger ending. But what I have to say is... this movie is definately my least favorite of the trilogy and you know, don't get me wrong it's a good movie but some of it's lacking. The plot involves Marty stuck in 1955 right after the Delorian was struck by lighting with Doc inside, sending him to 1885. So Marty gets the 1955 Doc to find another Delorian that 1885 Doc put in a mining cave in the outskirts of Hill Valley. When they find the Delorian they soon find out that Doc gets shot in 1885 by a bounty hunter. So now Marty has to go to 1885 to save Doc and face off with the bounty hunter himself. When Marty travels to the old west, the Delorian's fuel tank gets damaged so it can't get up to 88 miles by itself, so now he's stuck in 1885 with Doc, who finds true love with a person named Clara. That's one thing I never liked about this movie, its nice he found somebody but it does that thing that I hate, it happens in every romance movie: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy is depressed, boy gets girl in end. It kind of slows the movie down. And there isn't as much time travel or paradox in this movie which is what made the other two movies so great. But there are some funny moments and the interaction scenes with Doc and Marty are nice. And the train scene and the showdown scene are both great, giving nice little tributes to Clint Eastwood, and the music score is still awesome. So overall it's a good movie but it's a big step below the first two. But I still recommend it, it's a nice cap to the trilogy.
B003EYVXY6|5.0|The review by  Sarakani covers most of the bases, so I won't duplicate them here.  I will point out that the casting and acting were phenomenal.  The direction was very good, save for the fact that transitions from one scene to the next were sometimes to abrupt and tended to break the mood.  I will disagree with Sarakani on one thing.  This film is a much better film than Elizabeth Taylor's 'Cleopatra'.<br /><br />I agree that there was a conspiracy to keep this film from wide distribution in the US.  The reason is quite simple.  Those who would distribute the film fear the right wing Chrisianity much as the pagans feared the Christian thugs in the time the film portrayed.<br /><br />George Santayana said it best.  \\"Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\\"  Learn, people.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this book and just could not put it down. Every time I though I had the plot figured out it took another twist. I also didn't want it to end so I'm very glad there are two sequels \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest.\\"
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|After reading one too many biographies or historical novels, I find myself gravitating toward easy reads.  I bought this book on such a whim, expecting another fiction book I could cruise through with little semblance of literary value.  Though I was right about speeding through the book, I finished with a sense of awe at the capacity of such a quick read to leave me thinking.    Some authors aim to convey a message and challenge the reader's limits; others set out to entertain.  Few are they that manage to do both.  Tropper's true-to-life dialogue allows the book to flow easily and ensures a quick read.  This same dialogue also transformed the experience of reading into something more akin to watching a film.  Rest assured - if the response to black comedy in Arrested Development is any indication, no movie is on its way.    Some fiction books leave you on the edge of your seat with cliffhangers, yearning to find out what happens next.  Conversely, How to Talk to a Widower compels you know more about the tragically flawed main character.  I found myself wanting to know if he would develop for the better - and desperately hoping so.  Tropper has managed to create an emotional link between the reader and the character despite most, if not all, not being able to empathize with this type of experience.      Much like watching to a train wreck, it is flat out difficult to pull your eyes away from this book.  Though doused with a plenty of humor and black comedy, this book maintains, at heart, its tragic storyline.  For those that want it, this is the oxymoronic gift that Tropper consistently has to offer - light, readable tragedy.
B001HN694K|3.0|I wasn't terribly taken with this version of Alice In Wonderland.  While it was amazing as far as graphics go, the story was actually boggling.  I couldn't really understand what the point of the plot was.<br /><br />Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is at a party when she sees a mysterious white rabbit.  After falling down a hole, she comes to wonderland.  But it is much changed from the wonderland we all know as our childhood.  She actually encounters the Tweedles fairly quickly as well as a few other characters who tell her her destiny is to slay the Jabberwocky.<br /><br />A bit incredulous Alice is led to the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and associates.  He sets down his life to save her from the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and tells her to seek out the White Queen (Anne Hathaway).  There she prepares for the ultimate battle against the Jabberwocky.<br /><br />The characters in this movie, to me, were lukewarm at best.  While I always enjoy Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, they played the only characters that I actually enjoyed in the movie.  Even Alice didn't hold the charm for me she should have.  The rest of the characters seemed minor and weren't really developed.  One other exception would be the Cheshire cat, I found him delightful.<br /><br />While Burton's done some wonderful work, I just don't think this was up to his usual standard.  Even the music was only so-so any nothing that really made me go \\"wow\\".<br /><br />The makeup and visuals in this film are outstanding however.  They are very crazy looking but don't look fake or not well done.  A lot of care was put in the costumes and it made it very realistic.  Even the Mad Hatter's hat played an integral roll in the movie.<br /><br />Overall I wasn't terribly impressed.  But for a night with nothing else to do, I'd definitely watch it again.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|It's very horrible when watching a movie and as an audience not feel any connection or even care about the characters and this is what happened to me with this movie. I just found myself truly not caring if Perseus made it alive to the end and even when his friends were being killed it was really like when is the Kraken showing so this movie can be over. The original one [[ASIN:B002ZD3V10 Clash of the Titans (Keepcase)]] has nothing on this one with special effects but the characters come alive and you care about their troubles and tribulations. This new version  felt like it was just made to have the mythological creatures come alive in a new grand fashion with special effects thrown around but regrettably the storyline as well as the characters were lost. I recommend the first version with its second rate special effects which to tell the truth are really not that bad considering that it was made in 1981 you will get your moneys worth.
0060581808|5.0|I've always loved the Little House on the Prairie books.  And going back to read them as an adult is just as much of a pleasure.  Actually more so because there is a lot of useful information in these books about different activities.  While it might not have all the information about say, sugaring maple syrup, it does tell it from a regular point of view, so its like you're there watching how they do it instead of reading instructions from a book.<br /><br />This particular installment, Little House in the Big Woods, is about a year in the life of Laura Ingalls and her family while they still lived near their relatives in the big woods of Wisconsin.  It details what they did to prepare for the winter, be it butchering or putting up the harvest.  Then, throughout the winter, it tells of their wonderful Christmas tradition, the things they did on cold winter nights to make the time pass by, and gradually leads us to spring.<br /><br />The highlight of the spring section is the Sugaring-Off Dance and the collection of maple syrup.  Wilder gives great detail in this particular event and it is clear that it is one she remembers fondly.  They also go to town for the first time in this section of the book and see a town shop for the first time.<br /><br />Through summer it talks of planting and harvest and goes back into the fall time where this time Wilder covers other fall harvesting techniques such as threshing grain and making cheese.  It is interesting to note that for the making cheese they even list how the rennet is obtained.<br /><br />This book is obviously very suited for children, however, I should note, that in one of the songs that Wilder has listed there is a derogatory term.  However, being the time that this book was written it was appropriate to use this term, it could provide a valuable lesson for children on how things change in our world and why such words are not suitable to be used in today's society.  Everything else in the book is perfectly acceptable and indeed all the other songs are very age appropriate for young children.<br /><br />Also notable for the book, is the abundance of pictures to accompany each chapter.  While they are in black and white, they are very charming and do a great portrayal of the Ingalls' life.  There are at least two or three per chapter illustrated by Garth Williams.<br /><br />As always, this series was an enjoyable read and I loved going back to spend those first years with Laura while reading.<br /><br />Little House in the Big Woods<br />Copyright 1932<br />238 pagesngs are very age appropriate for young children.

1439190275|5.0|I went on Atkins 6 years ago on the advice of my endocrinologist who is also a weight loss and metabolic disorder specialist. He said \\"I've always believed in it ... my patients thrive on it.\\"    I lost 100 lbs. My blood pressure went from 160/92 to 117/58. My triglycerides went down to double digits.  Cholesterol: no problemo. Homocysteine levels: perfect. Had a heart scan just to be sure my arteries were fine. Know what was in them? Nothing but blood. Not a HINT of blockage after two years on the plan: the report came back: 0% blockage. Had a pre-surgery cardiac workup: stress test, the whole deal. Passed with flying colors. At 59 years of age. \\"Wow, you're in great shape\\" was the doc's response.     Then I had a few stressful years: divorce, two moves, job upheaval. Fell in love, strayed from the path and started putting the weight back on. Shame on me. I tried going 'nutritarian' and was hungry and sleepy and cranky all the time. And I didn't lose any weight. I'm back on the Atkins plan with the help of this book and am losing again and will stay on plan. I had forgotten how good I felt (and looked) when I eat this way. It's what my body needs and apparently thrives on. I'm my own best clinical trial. My doctor and my lab work agree.    My brother went low refined carb when he learned his cholesterol and triglycerides had skyrocketed on a diet of pasta and risotto. After going on Atkins his cholesterol was 120 and his triglycerides were 63. He's his own best clinical trial. His doctor said: \\"I don't know what you're doing, but just keep doing it.\\"    I'm a nurse, by the way, and I see so many patients who develop gestational diabetes. When they eat low refined carb on a nutritionally approved version for pregnant women, with plenty of protein, they have healthy weights going into delivery, their babies are born with more stable blood sugars, at truly healthy weights, not overblown IDM weights, and moms report feeling better than ever. Each one is her own best clinical trial. And doesn't it make sense as a new mom to have stable blood sugar levels? You're tired enough being a new mom: you need whole foods.     To address this book specifically: I appreciate the more flexible approach to Induction, which used to keep a lot of people from continuing with the plan. This makes it possible for more of us to continue this as a way of life. The rationale is solid: this is how bodies who have been abused by carbs respond to stopping the abuse. If you understand what the consequence is of each food choice, you make better choices.     And to those of you who think this is a meat vs. broccoli way of life, you're wrong. It's a meat, chicken, eggs AND broccoli, kale, tomato, celery, green beans, zucchini, romaine, spinach, cucumber, bell pepper, onion, chard, cabbage way of life.
1400052173|5.0|This book was first brought to my attention by my son who was asked to read it by his mentor at work, a Mr. Frank Lacks.  I became very interested in the story, doing some basic research on the Hela cell and Henrietta Lacks on the internet and decided to purchase the book.  It was a fasinating read.  Rebecca Skloot did a wonderful job of blending the scientific Hela cell with the human story of Henrietta Lacks and the Lacks family.  It was easy to read, short chapters, and heart breaking and warming all in one book. Fantastic job on a story that needed to be told.
B002ZG98VE|4.0|I went into this film with low expectations because I lacked real interest in the subject and knew of the mixed reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. That said, I can easily see why reviews are mixed; this is not the Robin Hood most expect or want. It is certainly far different from past Hollywood portrayals; perhaps it may even be said that this is a Robin Hood movie for those who do not like Robin Hood. Put simply, it is more serious and somewhat darker. The film is not tragic but has several tragic elements, and the tone is somber, while the humor that many will expect is rare and generally raunchy. Practically everything is different, from story to emphasis to presentation. Promotional material makes the story differences fairly clear. Those expecting repeated instances of \\"stealing from the rich and giving to the poor\\" will be disappointed; there is but one example, and several characters who usually figure largely - e.g., the Sheriff of Nottingham - have very minor roles. The film essentially focuses on what lead Robin to become the famous figure, which is in my view a wise move; the usual fare has after all been done enough - arguably almost ad nauseum - and could perhaps hardly be bettered. The fresh focus is appreciated and well-done; if director Ridley Scott's goal was putting his own proverbial stamp on a well-worn subject, he certainly succeeded. This not only means that many famous events are not shown or hardly present but also that the focus is sometimes not even on Robin specifically. The film is quasi-historical with substantial background detail. Those for whom such things are anathema will probably not like the film.    However, many others may. Anyone interested in medieval England will find much to appreciate; the movie gives a good idea of what the era was like, especially how people lived. Scott makes clear that it was a dark time; monarchs were oppressive, the church was corrupt, and the poor struggled just to survive. Whatever historicalliberties he takes, he cannot be faulted for putting these fundamental elements across forcefully. Some credit must go to the fine cinematography, which breathtakingly conveys rural England's beauty; though not going for a historical film in the strict sense, Scott vividly shows the vast differences between today and a thousand years ago. The story encompasses a wealth of English history and folklore; the former is not always accurate, but we must again remember that this is not a historical film per se, and the quality here is well above comparable films'. Perhaps more importantly, history buffs will appreciate how well such elements are integrated, particularly as a high degree of plausibility is maintained, and there are very few anachronisms aside from the obvious one of speech. The script is admirable overall; though not high art, it is far above typical Hollywood fare, especially in the summer season. Drama and suspense are high; we are drawn in quickly and held tightly. There are unfortunately a few tired movie clichés, especially in the final battle, but the film is remarkably free of the hackneyed triteness that so plagues Hollywood. The love story thankfully does not proceed quite as one would expect and is unusually believable. A more controversial sticking point is the action; it seems that everyone thinks there is either too little or too much. There is a large amount, and it is unusually visceral for popular Robin depictions or summer blockbusters generally; however, it is so spread out that fairly long periods pass without it despite grand battles at the beginning and end. Anyone wanting a pure action movie will likely become impatient, while those seeking something more substantial may have the opposite feeling; to me, though, the balance is just about right.     I hesitate to divert fans from the film even with all these caveats, as many elements central to the legend's continuing popularity are here in profusion - not least the ever-invigorating good/evil dichotomy and the political and moral themes inherent to a serious treatment. More importantly, some parts of the film are so well-done that everyone can appreciate them, notably the acting. Occasionally questionable accent aside, Russell Crowe is the perfect Robin, mixing machismo with quiet wisdom and humble piety. Cate Blanchett's Marion is one of her better recent performances, and Mark Strong in his role as the devilish Godfrey continues to prove that he is one of Hollywood's best up and coming character actors. Oscar Isaac is at least as good as the thoroughly loathsome King John, and some of the smaller players - notably William Hurt as Marshal and Eileen Atkins as the king's mother - are also excellent. All told, I encourage everyone to forego expectations and take the film on its own terms; some may be disappointed, but perhaps at least as many will be pleasantly surprised.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Only snobs and morons moan that Spartacus: Blood and Sand is red hot porn, riddled with historical inaccuracy, badly worded and, shock horror, entertaining! Well your fantasy has come true. Spartacus: Blood and Sand is a real piece of toilet paper for the dons to tut-tut at; and it's absolutely brilliant! Poetical, lyrical and haunting it isn't. Wisely pornographic and dangerously sexy; indeed it is. It's an outstanding performance that blows away more serious contenders to historical entertainment. Contenders such as the cackling of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar or HBO's pretentious Rome. I mean, who needs clever pretence when we can have CGI orgasms?<br /><br />HBO's Rome was never this brilliant and Julius Caesar is a plodding monster from the Elizabethan age. Who needs Shakespeare anyway? Spartacus Blood and Sand is the real deal; a foresayer for our troubled times. No pretentious poetry is called for here, just a rock solid adrenaline rush for higher primates to get stuck into. The obvious comparison of course is not an ancient play, but the more recent Rome by HBO. Spartacus is better by a hundred yards.<br /><br />HBO's Rome was a wild and absurd performance; really pointy headed and dull. It tried to be rude and clever at the same time but plainly it wasn't. What with its well scripted dialogue with the inevitable marketing to the masses shenanigans, and an arty dose of porn, but `arty-house' porn that got in the way of the story. Similar to the Sopranos rude bits, this was also a HBO masterpiece. Script and porn never mix you know; this is what I'm trying to say. So I had high hopes for Spartacus: Blood and Sand and I weren't disappointed.<br /><br />Is there a plot? Spartacus is a Thracian warrior from a rubbish CGI village, whose idyllic life as a hairy barbarian, with his stunningly breasted wife, is broken up forever by those dastardly Romans with English accents. Spartacus' wife is sold off into sex slavery and our hero is thrown into a steamy Gladiator camp, populated by perfectly formed bodied freaks, with white teeth, that resemble drones from a B movie called gay-bods united or something! Inevitably, Spartacus becomes the camp Gladiator number one. Hey that was most of the plot in just two paragraphs. Thank the lord for the porno bits then!<br /><br />Spartacus is in your face pornographic you see (well in your face to the extent that an American cable company can get away with). Even dialogue scenes, or what passes for a script, are interrupted by a blow or a breast scene. Rich couples dispassionately screw their slaves whilst discussing politics, Gladiators coolly screw slaves on their dinner break and naked people get wheeled on and off set at such a fast rate that it feels like your trapped on a pornographic merry-go-round dreamed up by a sub Thomas Pynchon with a psychedelic meat chopper! So it's a merry joyride for sure and no script to get in the way.<br /><br />It's wonderful to realize that the producers couldn't afford decent script writers and actors and so made high definition techno porno instead. All production companies should take note. This is how historical programs should be done. Who wants Shakespeare when you can get your kicks this way? The cast is pick and mix though. John Hannah, one of my favourite British actors, is great as always and so is Lucy Lawless, plus that cool black messenger guy from 300 is also worth watching. However, the rest of the cast are dreary, especially Andy Whitfield who plays Spartacus. I can't imagine that bloke galvanizing the slave population of southern Italy and rocking the might of the Roman Republic (as the historical Spartacus did). The extras who play the women slaves are all stunning too, but I was left wandering; why do these girls object themselves to this sort of humiliation, just to be in front of a camera? They are visibly extras and so obviously didn't get paid for appearing naked in such grotesquely statuesque positions. I seriously doubtthe chance of getting spotted this way. These beauties are either so desperate for the stardom that they would do almost anything, or they are feeding a serious drug habbit; like the beautiul girl in the movie Requiem for a Dream. It's sad.<br /><br />Anyway back to the action. As the zero budged scrip writing opened fun possibilities for being rude, the sets on Spartacus are rubbish too. Whereas HBO built huge sets and hired hundreds of extras to create the hussle and bussle of ancient Rome, this version has about ten people on screen at any one time and you never see big building sets and huge crowds. This gives a claustrophobic feel the program. However, the CGI is good, except the blood and fighting scenes; which are masterpieces. The fighting is the saving grace of the program; the fights are more like PS3 games rather than real life. Really cartoony CGI blood in high definition splattering in slow motion blah blah... But it works.<br /><br />Though a real plus is Spartacus' shameless steeling from 300 and Gladiator, but in a better way. Gladiators' dreamy and poignant memory-of-his-fit-wife bits, with the sub Enya music, are in here and so is 300's heavy metal guitar music during fight sequences. But those two movies used the music to average effect; Spartacus does these FX techniques on acid! Do you remember when Matrix pioneered that stop motion effect which looked utterly amazing the first time you saw it, but then all the subsequent movies started copying the effect until we all started to yawn? Well that amazing slow mo effect from 300 is used in Spartacus, but in absolutely every fight sequence; and it's bloody amazing. The editors have shown a spark of genius. So every swoosh of the sword to every blood splat is so forensically zoomed in on, with techno camera angles speeded then slowed, and CGI pasted so heavily that I starting wetting myself and having nightmares! No I'm exaggerating but you get the picture.  Spartacus uses these blood and guts comic book effects so much and I kept noticing the rip offs so often, that I set aside Spartacus and started reaching for my meat cleaver and bloody axe.<br /><br />A worrying amount of reviewers complain that Spartacus is too bloody and gory and over violent and rude blah blah, but they are either stupid intellectual people or, more likely, just honest guys who are sadly missing the point. Spartacus is like a computer game, or better still, a cartoon, and games and cartoons (like Ichy and Scratchy or Tom and Jerry etc) can never be violent. You need a sense of realism for a program to be violent you see, because violence is an opposite of empathy and empathy is a real world emotion. This is why cartoons, games and generally works of art that lack realism, can never be violent, no matter how much blood and swearing there is, the game will never be the real world territory and Spartacus resembles a computer game more than a real historical program. This is why it's a new paradigm in artwork.<br /><br />You see, the porn is indeed impressive, and I think the pornography in here is a work of art, and only an idiot would complain and take offence by pre-packaged porn for an American cable channel. And hey, haven't you heard? Real porn is the mortar that holds the Internet together anyway, and its free (you should never pay for it is what I'm getting at!). Come on guys, this is the future of internet porn, and your only sleepwalking into dumbsville when you moan about violence and sex of this sort. Stick to games which let you control the action and if you really want porn, well be smart.... I'll let you figure the rest out.<br /><br />We should never pay to see art because it will only encourage the film companies to make more! Buy Spartacus instead. So if you're paying for pointy headed gibberish or old hat poetry, you're missing out on your birthright and you will further dumb down our culture, and then our children will be even dumber than we are today! So let's make a stand, every one of us now; come on we can do it, let us refuse to be insulted by toilet paper such as HBO's Rome and all of William Shakespeare's works. Buy Spartacus Blood and Sand today. It is your birthright in this uncaring universe and the future of civilisation.book effects so much and I kept noticing the rip offs so often, that I set aside Spartacus and started reaching for my meat cleaver and bloody axe.<br /><br />A worrying amount of reviewers complain that Spartacus is too bloody and gory and over violent and rude blah blah, but they are either stupid intellectual people or, more likely, just honest guys who are sadly missing the point.

B0039SFKSW|5.0|Most of the 5-star review have captured everything I would want to say but I just felt obligated to add another positive review so more people might buy this.     I've been a fan of Asia since the beginning (I was 17 at the time). It was a classic album that will most likely not be passed in it's genre. Surprisingly though, I stayed away from Alpha and Astra and was content with just listening to the singles and a few other tracks on radio. They just didn't cut it for me. I'm also a huge fan of John Wetton solo and have everything he has release to date. Which makes it more surprising that I started buying the John Payne-era material. Personally, I thought a lot of what this version of the group put out was excellent (especially when Steve Howe was guesting). I even went as far as tracking down Geoff Downes solo material and even Max Bacon to get some different takes on Asia tunes - suggested if you can find it by the way.     Besides some Greatest Hits packages to complete my early Asia needs, my next exposure to the reunited Asia was Phoenix. Personally, I liked this album. While certainly not as good as the first album, I thought it ranked up there with Alpha. Now comes Omega and they hit the nail on the head. John Wetton has never sounded better and the songs are equally as good as the debut. There are a few songs I don't care for on this release including Ever Yours but that is the sacrifice you make in this day and age when artists can fit more music on to a release.     People should stop associating Asia with Prog music just because of their roots. This is just good music performed by good musicians and that is all that needs to be said.    Favorite tracks: Light the Way, Listen Children, Finger on the Trigger and Holy War.    Very recommended.
1416594787|5.0|This book helps us to learn about the wonders of evolution and natural selection. It has  a lot of complex information, but Richard Dawkins makes it easy to understand. This is a book that every intelligent person should read.
B001GJ3VYG|5.0|I admit I am a little late buying and listening to this gem. Its ironic, since I have been waiting for its release since 2003s last recording. Safe Trip Home is somewhat colder, sadder and soberly emotional as previously heard. Perhaps its the state of the music industry that has basically fallen off the face of the planet. Its musical power from this artist hasnt faltered in the least. Modern melodies you can sing along with that have become Dido's trademark. This time, there is a less brighter side.<br /><br />I Dont Believe In Love, the first track/single was poorly promoted in the U.S.A. It is radio friendly, and the most upbeat track. Next, things slow down to an somber pace that illustrates a failed relationship. Grafton Street builds to a powerful, mornful crescendo, with a Celtic accent. The rest of the record has some pain, yet its there to share, which makes it tolerable. Burning Love(not to be confused with Elvis) is fun and promises that Dido will continue her brilliant career. It end with Northern Skies-which sums up the mood of the record in a nutshell. Its about letting go of a world that we are familiar with, yet hold no future-\\"cold comfort\\".<br /><br />I purchased the deluxe edition, which contains three bonus tracks. For One Day is upbeat and classic Dido. Summer is the one warm moment here, bringing light and comfort to the work. The remix of Northern Skies doesnt really change the song, yet it is such a great song, its woth listening to again.
B0031OCY2E|4.0|\\"The Informant\\" is a fun movie.  My family watched this film recently and found it funny and engaging.<br /><br />\\"The Informant\\" is based on a true story of an executive of Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), a huge multinational corporation.  The executive, Mark Whitacre, played by Matt Damon, observes colleagues engaging in what he considers illegal behavior.  Mark decides to report the behavior to the FBI and become their informant.  Mark acts as an FBI spy for nearly three years.<br /><br />What happens with Mark as a spy is a bit like a mystery story with information and plots frequently changing.  Mark continues as a spy, but his task keeps modifying and the information he recovers is a continuing surprise to The FBI and the movie audience.<br /><br />Matt Damon is wonderful as Mark Whitacre.  I have seen Matt in several other movies but was unaware of his comedic talent.  The story is told with the main character  narrating the action nonstop.  As Mark tells us about events he continually adds asides commenting on the events around him and his impressions of life.  These side comments are hilarious.  The film is worth seeing for the asides alone.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Informant\\".  If you like humorous impromptu asides you will love this film.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I loved the book & looked forward to the movie. The movie does not disappoint.<br />The movie adapts itself so very well from the book. The story is very closely followed. The acting is superb by all involved. The direction is superb as well.<br />As a period piece set in the early 1950's, the time frame of that era is excellent.<br /><br />Pay attention & follow closely or this story will lose you. It messes with your head, as it should, being set in a psychiatric hospital of that era. The end in which you find the truth of Mr. DiCaprio's character is much more satisfying than the book. The book does not spell the ending out as clearly as the movie.<br /><br />This is a \\"No Miss\\" movie
0316044938|2.0|This book is so sad, so sad, that I could barely finish it. It had so many stories inside one that made no sense sometimes. I didn't like it and don't recommend it.
B002RVZV9K|2.0|As a guitarist and a huge fan of all three players this documentary focuses upon, I was ultimately disappointed in the film. I really can't understand the large number of 5-star reviews. Leading up to the release of the film, I was thrilled by the concept; these are definitely three iconic guitarists of their respective generations, and getting them together seems a brilliant idea. Unfortunately, other than getting them together, the film's creators don't seem to have had much of an idea of what to do with them once the cameras started rolling. With no interviewer serving to spur on discussion, Page, Edge, and White are left to figure out how to interview each other, and sadly don't do a very good job. It's very telling that so much of the film is actually recaps of each individual's career, with interviews done away from the \\"summit\\" that is ostensibly the centerpiece of the film. Given how uninteresting the actual summit footage is, it's really not surprising. There is a lot of awkward silence, abortive attempts to teach each other songs, and muddled discussion that never really goes anywhere. There are some interesting moments, such as when they are jamming a bit on Zep's \\"In My Time of Dying\\" and Edge takes a pretty cool solo... but they are outnumbered by the moments of awkwardness. This reaches its height when, at the end of the film, they manage to work up a rendition of \\"The Weight\\" by The Band, of all things. Utterly bizarre.    I also did not get the impression that the film's creators really knew a whole lot about guitar, which is allegedly the subject matter of the whole film. There's a sequence titled \\"Jimmy's Strat\\" which details Page's first electric guitar purchase. Page is so iconically linked to the Les Paul (and so rarely linked to the Fender Strat) that this just seems ridiculous. There's also this whole series of scenes featuring White and his 8-year-old self (i.e., a child actor), which, while kind of novel, seems gimmick-y and out of place. Again, I think it is patently obvious that there was little salvageable footage of the three together, and thus the film needed padding.    While not a total loss, the film is far less than it could have been. There's really nothing insightful here for guitarists, and the biographical info will be well known to anyone who is already a dedicated fan of the respective subjects. It was certainly worth a Netflix rental, but even as a massive Zep and U2 fan (and slightly less massive fan of White's), I am really in no hurry to pay money for this.    The filmmakers obviously wanted a rock guitar \\"My Dinner with Andre.\\" What they ultimately produced is, at best, three unfinished episodes of \\"Behind the Music\\" crammed on to one disc.
B000063Y8F|2.0|Been chopping & grating garlic for 50 years because garlic presses were always a pain but still kept searching.  Finally bought yet another one because of its provenance and styling : The Roesle came apart at the weld after a few presses .  So much for curb appeal.  Then saw the review of the KUN RIKON in Cooks' Magazine and bought it -- a revelation.  Superb in handling, output, residual, and cleaning.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|This is a very original psychological thriller that keeps you guessing till the end - I was shocked. Extremely well done with superb acting. Can be a little disturbing because of how real it seems, but man is it a good ride. I can't wait to get this blu-ray and watch it again!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Every once in a long while, an album or musician comes from out of practically nowhere with something surprising, new, and exciting. I saw first one, then many magazine articles praising the sheer off-the-wall creativity in Ms. Monae's album, The ArchAndroid, and decided to check it out. It's rare that I'll buy an album based solely on positive reviews, but I found myself intrigued and the price was right.  The title alone is a clue that this is not your ordinary R&B album. Instead, it's a genre-hopping tapestry of styles, fantastic singing, positive energy, and (best of all) intelligent lyrics.<br /><br />The cover and main inspiration are based on the Fritz Lang masterpiece \\"Metropolis,\\" so, as a fan of classic movies and science fiction, this is the kind of thing I love. The variety and freshness of Monae's approach won me over quickly, and I'm finding this to be just a great, rewarding listening experience. Like The Roots' \\"Things Fall Apart,\\" this album weaves fascinating ideas inspired by classic works in order to create a piece of art that is also big-time fun.<br /><br />The ArchAndroid is a must-have for fans of R&B, and I'd strongly encourage music-lovers of other genres to give this a listen as well. This is not just some flavor-of-the-month created by record executives. Monae is the real deal, and The ArchAndroid is really something special.

It's been so good to me that I would've bought it even if I had to at it's regular retail price! There are SO many episodes to watch & they all amuse & entertain me.

0446563048|5.0|After reading Delivering Happiness, by Tony Hsieh, I only have one word to say. WOW! Mostly, I read fiction. One of the things I enjoy the most is living in the world the author has created for a while. Usually, the more unrealistic the world, the harder time I have 'reintegrating' back into the real one. Well, the world of Zappos, the online shoe empire, is a real one. And after I finished reading this account of the life of Tony Hsieh and the creation and rise of Zappos, I want to live in his world!<br />Tony Hsieh and I are exactly the same age. We went to college at the same time, in the same state even, but my experiences were very different from his. His desire to recreate a tribe of people who support each other is an admirable one, and one I remember having myself after college was over. I would never have believed it possible to sustain this sort of experience, but he has done exactly that. He has created the ideal business world in Zappos, one in which the individual is valued and seen as a valuable commodity to be invested in, rather than squeezed for every last drop of life before the person quits from burnout.<br />The descriptions of Tony's early childhood experiences as an entrepreneur are very vivid, and for a (I hesitate to use the word, since it doesn't quite feel accurate) contemporary, I can picture his labors over worm farms, lemonade stands and the like while picturing my own childhood endeavors (a jewelry business with my sister, and once even a junk store on vacation in Canada!).<br />Tony claims to be a terrible writer, but contrary to that claim, he tells his story with both flair and vivid detail, engaging the reader right away. The story begins with his personal life and how it evolved into his early business, LinkExchange. It then begins to detail the early years of Zappos and how it came to be, utilizing interesting bon mots from employees as well as the other honchos of the business.<br />Toward the end, the book felt less like a story, and more like a manual of how to make your business one like Zappos, which is a fine thing to strive for, in my opinion. I don't personally work in corporate America; I have heard the stories from others of situations and work environments that sound mind numbing and horrible. It is one of the reasons why I did not lean in that direction for a career. However, while reading about the \\"culture\\" of Zappos, one of the things that the company prides itself on very strongly, I found myself wondering if I'd fit in, if the people there would see me as a good fit. I think that is a huge accomplishment for someone who is not interested in working in a corporate environment to wonder if it wouldn't be a fine idea to work for this corporation. It shows that they must be on to something very special.<br />The title, Delivering Happiness, has a dual meaning. As a steady patron of Zappos myself, I was unaware of their \\"culture\\" as a company. I love shoes, and they definitely delivered that happiness to me on multiple occasions. The description of this culture in the book reminds me of the old saying that it takes a village to raise a child. Tony Hsieh delivers happiness to his customers while simultaneously encouraging his employees to find it within their work. The emphasis is on customer service, but it is clear that he is also very interested in his employees finding happiness of their own, not just delivering it to others.<br />This book is inspiring; I found myself thinking of ways I could incorporate Zappos 10 Core Values into my workplace, although in education, many of these are integral to what we do already. My favorite core value is definitely \\"Create Fun and A Little Weirdness\\". That sounds a lot like what I strive for on a daily basis, and it's nice to know others do, too.<br />I was sent two advance copies of this book by the Delivering Happiness team after hearing of the promotion from another blogger. I admit, I thought it was a bit too pushy, but after readingthis book, I am wholeheartedly advising others to visit Tony Hsieh's world as well. I recommend this book to shoe lovers, corporate workers, and pretty much everyone else. You won't be sorry after visiting the world of Zappos. I promise.edly advising others to visit Tony Hsieh's world as well. I recommend this book to shoe lovers, corporate workers, and pretty much everyone else. You won't be sorry after visiting the world of Zappos. I promise.
B00275EGWY|3.0|Maybe watching a film after it wins the Oscar creates unrealistic expectations. But like others, I don't get it. If this was chosen over Avatar because of its acting and story then they just got it wrong. Avatar excels in both areas(derivitive though its story may be). The Hurt Locker plays more like a documentary because there really is little story to it. Shocking and tension filled it may be, but great film-making? No. Best film of the year was Watchmen. Best war film of the year was Green Zone.

B003ELY7PG|4.0|Rework is written by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, founders of 37Signals a new kind of successful company in the web 2.0 era : few employees living in different parts of the world, simple products based on simple software frameworks rather than full-blown enterprise java. It's written concisely and can be read easily in any order to check some aspects.    Their book is about how they built the way they're working in their own company, revealing their thoughts about every parts : entrepreneurship, starting, growing, productivity, competition, marketing, culture. All these different facets are interesting because they go against the usual views of the enterprise 1.0 and anyway built a successful and well-living company.    I love to read about real-world applications for such different ways of thinking as web 2.0 bring us many enterprise services for a low price, it confirmed me that building a small company in a different way is clearly possible. Rework is about a redefinition of work, break old adages and embrace new ones for a better work.

Not the same story you are familiar with. You'll see how it evolved to what is had become, and enjoyed, from 1977 until today.  Original interviews with cast and crew, some dating back a year or two before the movie came out.  It is so interesting to see these Q and As before the film was a huge success, or even viewed, by the public.  How Lucas put his heart and soul into the project, a true labor of love.  Just getting it green lighted by a studio was a painstaking effort.  Hundreds of photographs in which, I am positive, you have never seen before.  You will find this book fascinating and very enjoyable. Even before a Special Edition or renaming the epic from Star Wars to \\"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\\" this little film was truly loved and a masterpiece.

0446563048|5.0|I make a living helping companies improve their performance.  Bar none, the absolute hardest challenge is dealing with outdated, defunct, and proven-failed management and leadership attitudes and techniques.  It's even harder when leaders won't let go of them.<br /><br />Attitudes that don't account for the emotional needs of people.<br /><br />Attitudes that don't start with the fundamental requirement that tough or large changes require the top-down example and behavior to lead the way.<br /><br />Attitudes that don't stand up for what's right and acquiesce to blatant cognitive dissonance.<br /><br />Attitudes that fail to realize you can't lay-out the company's supposed mission or vision, or the staff's objectives and goals, and not provide them with the tools or empowerment to make anything happen -- or worse, to undermine efforts with behaviors and decisions that conflict with the messages.<br /><br />Attitudes that perpetually fail to create sustainable results, superior performance, and legendary relationships among the company staff, and between the company and its suppliers and customers; yet they are the same attitudes that failure-destined leaders continue to retread in some insane hope or expectation that everything will work out on its own.<br /><br />Well, here's some not-so-profound news (which I'm pretty sure you didn't need me to tell you): these attitudes are nothing short of leadership's inability to own up to their responsibilities and accountability for actually doing what they're there to do: lead.<br /><br />Instead of leading you'll often find such cowardly executives hiding behind backbone-belying excuses such as \\"I lead through delegation\\" (which, when said by these leaders actually means, \\"I really don't know what to do to help you get your job done\\"), or \\"I trust my people to do the right thing\\" (which, when said by such leaders, actually means, \\"I'm lucky my people know what they're doing because I don't\\"), or \\"I'm serious about quality, I've made Joe, here, the company quality sheriff\\" (which is poser-leader-speak for, \\"I haven't the foggiest idea what drives quality in our company and but it's a problem and I don't know how to fix it, but getting someone else to blame is a lot easier than getting mixed-up with all that touchy-feely stuff.\\").<br /><br />Such leaders are nothing more than overpaid, over-indulged and over-honored paper-pushers whose lack of involvement in day-to-day operations is probably a blessing.  Because, when they do get involved (especially considering their only natural inclination is to micro-manage if/when they bother), they typically don't make things better.<br /><br />In a profound way, most companies' leaders simply don't \\"get it\\", they won't admit that they don't get it, and they're not open to having anyone help them get it.<br /><br />One the basic \\"its\\" they don't *get* is that what's going on in their company is a culture, and because they don't see what's going on as a culture, or appreciate the role culture plays in making a business successful, they not only don't see that what they need is to change the culture, but that in order to do so they must lead the change themselves.<br /><br />Furthermore, they don't see that what it means to change the culture is not to pass down new rules or to disseminate a verbal memo through subordinates, it means to get out and lead.  To behave or simply *BE* the new culture.  How flat does a new, great-sounding idea fall when it's delivered in the same mechanisms as all the old, not-as-great (dare I say \\"dumb\\") ideas?<br /><br />Do you agree?<br /><br />Perhaps you need validation of your way of thinking.<br />Perhaps you need an example to follow.<br />Perhaps you need to crystallize your thoughts so you can pave a path.<br />Or perhaps you need something to believe in, something to help you find a better way to work, place to work, or how to start making a difference in your work life and work-life balance.<br /><br />Maybeyou're someone who's been burned trying such non-traditional ideas and you're seeking what might have been missing, or a simple reflection on a point you didn't see or know to look for.<br /><br />In any case, if you are seeking how to understand and positively influence culture as a primary business driver of positive change and astounding accomplishments, then Tony' Hseih's Delivering Happiness is a must read.  Scratch that.  If you're reading this review this far you MUST read.  Delivering Happiness.  Even if you're currently not big on culture as a business driver, or, if you think you know about culture and business but secretly, deep down, you really have no clue what it is, how it looks, or how to create the one you want, you must read this book.  If you *know* your business has a culture problem but don't know what to do about it, read this book.<br /><br />The amazing things Tony and his team have accomplished by putting _happiness_ at the center of their existence and by making it unmistakably simple to lead by example will leave you wondering why it's taken anyone this long to put this sort of content together.  There is nothing new in leading by example.  It's talked about, written about, lectured about in every credible business and management venue anywhere at any time in history.  But, one thing (of many others) unique in Tony's book is that he actually conveys _what_that_looks_like_.  It's not just words to him and his team.  It's how they *are*.  It's in everything they do and say and consider.  They wanted a certain culture?  They *became* that culture and started every action from there.  It's in how they treat each other, their customers, their suppliers, their partners and their extended relationships.  They want to sustain that culture?  They *built* and *rebuilt* their existence to continually refine what it takes to generate the culture they want.  Delivering Happiness is like being the ultimate \\"fly on the wall\\" to get the insight into answering the question most business books and theories frustratingly fail to answer, \\"OK, I get what you /describe/, but what did you *do*?!\\"  This book lays it out.<br /><br />Delivering Happiness will probably make you wonder why bother with any other business approach, and even why bother with any other business book!  It's as though all you ever wanted to know about running a business and making people happy (either as one, the other, or both) are in his 272-page first offering.  I'm not saying other business books don't matter, and that other business books don't have valuable insights and concepts.  What I'm saying is that Delivering Happiness is so fundamental that it almost makes no sense to start elsewhere.  If business leaders don't understand the fundamentals of the role culture plays in their success and what to do to generate the culture they want, then little else can help.<br /><br />Tony's done great research.  Thanks (or no thanks?) to Delivering Happiness, my reading list has not only grown, but has sprouted an entirely new branch of exploration.  It's fascinating stuff.  I was so intrigued I rescheduled several days' plans to finish-up some of the reading I had already started so I could clear my reading time and my mind for the new stuff Tony introduced me to.<br /><br />Not only does Tony make an eloquent and convincing case for the influence and effects of business culture, but his amazing story about [...] and the insights from places he worked or owned before -- as they all relate to _happiness_ -- are inspiring and instructive -- for anyone with an open mind.<br /><br />And... not the kind of \\"open mind\\" that rationalizes nonsense, but the kind of open mind that's open to questioning tradition; asking where a tradition came from and why it continues to exist despite its time having come and gone.  The kind of open mind that's continually seeking better ideas built on progress and results, not on reactionary fears, theory, or short-term thinking.And, the kind of open mind that's ready to make a really big difference in their work, life, or in the world, and not cling to stale thinking born of a time when those old ideas were once new.<br /><br />It's time to replace those ideas with ideas built in and for the 21st Century.  It's time for ideas that deliver results.  It's time to start Delivering Happiness.<br /><br />P.S. I received a free copy of the book so that I could read it and write an honest review about it in time for the launch date.  I received my free copy on nothing but the promise that I would write an honest review, and, all I received was the free book.

All this is just to say: this is a very honest, unencumbered review.  There are no strings attached in any way for having written it.  Go read Delivering Happiness.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|When this show first aired, I was blown out of the water (like smoke on water!). The first few episodes were probably the most memorable, and it only got better as the series progressed. From misery, sorrow, love, fate, betrayal, revenge, retribution, redemption and of course mystery this series has seen it all at its absolute finest. This show has really changed my life and has opened my eyes and my mind to the limitless possibilities life could offer. This show has made me into a strong believer of 'everything happens for a reason'. Every single thing on the show itself happens for a reason, and when it all unfolds slowly before your eyes you gain a deep appreciation and satisfaction. Some people criticize that not all 100% of the topics and enigmas on the show are fully explained, but I still feel satisfied the way the entire show played out and how it ended. LOST would not be the same if every single detail was illuminated and explicated. Looking back on the entire show, I enjoy feeling the great sense of mystery I once felt watching all of it when it all aired. There will never be another show that could come close. I could make this review go on forever telling how powerful the series is, but it is best to watch it for ones self and just enjoy every second of it!
1451532512|5.0|Many consider \\"The Tempest\\" to be the final play that Shakespeare wrote solo, which gives a certain bittersweet flavor to its story -- especially since the main character is a sorcerer who manipulates others to get the ending he desires. Shakespeare juggled a trio of main stories before tying them off in rare style, but it's Prospero and his final speech that are truly intriguing.<br /><br />For many years, the exiled Duke of Milan Prospero has lived on a remote island with his young daughter Miranda. But when he discovers that his treacherous brother Antonio and his similarly treacherous friends are nearby on a sailing ship, he summons a storm that causes the ship to crash on the island.<br /><br />And like a puppet-master, Prospero arranges this as he wants -- he sends his servant Ariel to haunt the men who betrayed him, he thwarts the machinations of his evil servant Caliban, and he pretends to treat Alonso's son Ferdinand badly while secretly matchmaking him with Miranda. In the end, everything will be as he desired.<br /><br />\\"The Tempest\\" is a play with two different dimensions. On one hand, we have a simple story about a mage whose power allows him to manipulate everything in his little domain. And on the other, we have the story of a brilliant storyteller who arranges his own little worlds as he sees fit, and bids farewell to his role (\\"Now my charms are all o'erthrown/And what strength I have's mine own...\\")<br /><br />And appreciated on its own, \\"The Tempest\\" is a brilliant play -- Shakespeare juggled the three main plotlines nicely, and brought a solid sense of resolution to the story. His rich dialogue is stunning (\\"But doth suffer a sea-change/Into something rich and strange/Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell...\\"), especially during Ariel's songs and Prospero's speeches. Even the insults are brilliant -- just try yelling \\"A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!\\" at someone you don't like.<br /><br />Prospero is a rather unique character -- he rules over his little island with magical powers, sort of like a local demigod. Everything that happens on the island is because he wants it to be so, but he's a sad, benevolent figure rather than a tyrannical one. And Shakespeare sketches up an intriguing cast of characters, both mortal and immortal -- the ethereal, puckish Ariel and grotesque Caliban, the naive Miranda, and the contemptible trio of onetime conspirators.<br /><br />\\"O brave new world, That has such people in't!\\" cries Miranda at the end of \\"The Tempest,\\" and while not every character in it deserves a \\"brave new world,\\" the play itself feels like a weekend trip into a magical world.e island with magical powers, sort of like a local demigod.

0099529734|5.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is not just A Christmas story, but one of THE Christmas stories -- not only is it instantly recognizable by pretty much everybody, but it's relentlessly copied and spoofed in countless Christmas specials. But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.<br /><br />Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.<br /><br />And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.<br /><br />So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.<br /><br />You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.<br /><br />Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.<br /><br />He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.<br /><br />Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all.

B0035J6TAI|3.0|Don't get me wrong - I like Peter Gabriel to the point of hero worship. He and I have had a long and loyal journey and I spent MANY hours joyously listening to vintage Genesis (I skipped the commercial era after he left, although I went to the Invisible Touch tour in Brisbane - what a medley!!!) and then his first solo works from the first four identically named albums through to a sporadic few since.    I'm a massive fan, OK? Peter is the only artist I ever considered writing to once to find out how he could get across in music the plight of the South American Indians almost by osmosis. Except I thought I'd look like a sad stalker.    I stopped reading the reviews for this album because I thought I had my own take on it until I saw the word \\"funereal\\" in one of them, which is how I summed it up to my wife, and didn't want to be influenced further.    It may be too early for me to be writing this, because I'm starting to get it. Sure the build/crescendo/fade of each song becomes a tiresome formula if listened to back to back, but there are flashes of genius emerging. Philadelphia is sublime. I'm a bit miffed, though, that Gabriel tried to cover up the breaking notes in the sacred Radiohead \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\" by making it look intentional because his straining voice happened to fade in and out. Just be honest and do a re-take.    I initially thought some of the orchestral arrangements were poor - because they didn't have that big philharmonic sound. But now I see that even the instruments have been stripped down to compliment how the songs have been broken down vocally.    Don't try this in one helping - discover the tracks randomly on a mixed play list.
1563890119|5.0|The world of comic books was a very different place before the Sandman came into being. Neil Gaiman revolutionized the graphic novel with \\"The Sandman Vol. 1: Preludes and Nocturnes,\\" an exquisite story filled with shadowy realistic art and strange magical beings. This is one of those rare stories that tantalizes you with beauty and chills you to your core, all at the same time.<br /><br />A group of occultists are attempting to summon and trap Death... but instead, they capture Dream and lock him in a glass orb. Decades pass, and countless people are locked in slumber -- unable to dream, unable to wake for long. One day, Dream escapes his prison and reenters the world, but loses the last of his power with his final act of revenge.<br /><br />His Dreamworld palace has fallen into ruin, and his magical items have been scattered. To regain his power, he must get back his helm, his pouch of sand, and his dreamstone. His journey to regain them will take him across worlds -- to John Constantine and a woman destroyed by dreams, to the depths of Hell at a demonic club, and a ghastly madman who drives various people to depravity and death.<br /><br />The world of \\"The Sandman\\" is a strange one -- it lightly interlocks with other graphic novel series, effortlessly slips from one world to another, and exposes both the beauty and ugliness of our own world. \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" is an excellent introduction to Neil Gaiman's strange, expansive world -- as well as his hollow-eyed anti-hero.<br /><br />At its core, the story is rather simple, since it's basically a quest for Dream's three magical \\"tools.\\" But Gaiman paints it with foreshadowing, nightmarish grotesqueries (flesh melting off bones, John Dee's drooling lipless face), and some zanily macabre humor (the Hellfire Club... in hell!). And as the dust settles, Gaiman caps his story off with a quieter interlude in which Dream encounters his sister Death.<br /><br />And the artwork is sublime -- realistic in style, but often bizarre and a little frightening in theme. And despite the core colors being shadowy greys, whites and blacks, there are splashes of bright colors everywhere. Green fields, blue hallways, psychedelic skies, hallucinations filled with sickly pallid hues.<br /><br />And Gaiman created one of his most iconic, complex characters in Dream -- his inhumanness is underlined by acts of great cruelty and kindness, and his sad, grim demeanor is more than a little touching. The author also spun up a very nonstereotypical version of Death. No robes, scythes or skeletal faces here. In fact, forget about anything sinister -- this version of Death is a delightfully quirky, perky goth chick.<br /><br />\\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" is a harrowing and hypnotic look into the world of dreams -- what happens when the Sandman is imprisoned, and what must be done after.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|I don't like musicals. Luckily this isn't one: it is a film about stage performers and has some of the acts. Not a musical, but great entertainment.<br />Nearly 40 years after, a revisit, and guess what: this piece of show business hasn't aged at all. I had to talk my daughter into watching it with me. She gave in grudgingly and then she was delighted, mainly with Joel Grey as the MC in the sleezy cabaret club in Berlin 1931. Sarah didn't quite agree with the Oscar for Liza Minelli, because Liza's acting is not really on the level of her singing.<br /><br />A young Englishman (it is based on Christopher Isherwood's Berlin Tales), who thinks that he is gay (which is possibly a travesty of the book, which I have not read yet, but plan to), comes to Berlin in the early 30s and meets this American cabaret singer, who teaches him to be more versatile in his tastes. These are the years of street battles between Nazis and Communists. Much of 'central Germany' is deluded and thinks the Nazis can be used to get rid of the Reds and then they can be controlled. We know that this did not work as planned. Berlin's cultural life was as wild then as it is now. Predictably the Nazis were going to put an iron heel on perversions like this delightful place.<br /><br />Entirely pleasing, still, after all these years! There is only one 'false' scene, and that is the Landgasthaus scene where the Englishman (Michael York) and the German Baron (Helmut Griem), who has turned the couple into prostitutes before they understood what happened to them, watch a Nazi Liedershow, starting with a pretty young blond man singing a patriotic song and then the whole audience in the place coming up with a brillant fascist choir performance. That is at the same time 'wrong' in the sense of unrealistic, but also right, because it gives an eery forecast of things to come.

1416955070|3.0|I didn't know this going into the book, but apparently the author is quite famous in the Harry Potter fandom world. I really didn't have any idea what the book was about when I started. Frankly, I just liked the cover.<br /><br />This book was pretty much a combination of Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I could pick out elements from all the different books/series, and use them to predict what was going to happen next.  In some ways, that was good, in others, it was a little corny.<br /><br />The characters were mostly good, none really stood out to me as being fantastic.  Except perhaps Luke. I really liked his character and learning more about him as the book progressed.  I also really liked the integration of vampires, werewolves, faeries, and demons. The vampires were not sparkly, and the wolves were not full of teen angst. The underground world was fascinating, similar to Harry Potter's world.<br /><br />Overall, the book was fun. It wasn't brilliantly original or anything, but it had some good points. It was good enough for me to continue the series.

We never even came across it by accident turning channels over the past 3 years.<br /><br />But the people working on this show deserve great praise for bringing the early 1960s alive !!<br /><br />Sometimes you forget you are watching a recreation of the 60s and feel like you are really watching something from that era.<br /><br />Much of the show's initial charm rests in it's nostalgic recreation of the culture of the era ........ we can also get a chuckle by seeing products featured on the show we remember from our younger days.<br /><br />The only small critique I may make is the storylines sometime move at such a slow and agonizing pace it gets a little boring.<br /><br />Despite the praise above, I must confess after 2 seasons, we have lost all interest in the show.<br /><br />I suppose it cant' be helped being a time period drama, but it started to feels like nothing more than a daytime Soap Opera but set in the 60s.<br /><br />Maybe the unique novelty of being so authentically set in the 60s made it feel special for 2 Seasons ....... but now it just plods along like an episode of \\"As The World Turns\\".<br /><br />So we went from LOVING the show to not caring to watch the remaining episodes or the current new season on AMC.
B000089RV6|5.0|Listen this is one of the GREATEST ALBUMS EVER and if you are a hard rock/heavy metal fan like me YOU NEED THIS! All the songs are great and each one just is an awesome rock expierience. My favorites are \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Shoot To Thrill\\", and basically every single song! The guitars are great, the bass is great, the drums are great, the vocals are great! Every thing is great! It is the perfect blend of heavy metal and rock. I just love listening to it. I wouldn't listen to all their bad reviews listen to the 5 star ones. Your taste in music may be different than mine mine, but all in all it is the one of the best albums out there and I may not have listed all the stuff I should have, but I am a kid so if you think I haven't listed enough look at the other 5 star reviews.
6305558167|5.0|A great movie on the Arthurian legend. Beginning with the retrieval of the sword from the Lady of the Lake by Merlin to give to King Uther Pendragon, thus beginning the saga, and ending with Sir Percival (Paul Geoffrey) returning the sword to the Lady of the Lake, after King Arthur (Nigel Terry)  is mortally wounded. This includes all the important elements of the Arthurian from the classic 'Le Morte d' Arthur'.<br />Uther Pendragon's captivation by the beauty of Queen Igraine, and how this causes the war between Pendragon and the Duke of Cornwall to be renewed. Pendragon's disguise by Merlin as Cornwall so he can partake of Igraine, and Merlin claiming the infant Arthur promised to him by Uther. I was struck by the anguish of the child Morgana ( Barbara Byrne) who knows her father is dead and that the disguised Uther is not her father, as he ravishes Igraine , followed the child's  cruel treatment by Uther.<br />The classic scene where the young Arthur removes the coveted sword from the stone, followed by the wars of his succession.<br />The mood is dark throughout most of the movie, and the evil of Morgana (Helen Mirren), the enigma of Merlin (Nicol Williamson), the anguished lust between Queen Guenevere ( Cherie Lunghi) and Lancelot (Nicholas Clay), Arthur's great champion and the jealousy of Sir Gawain (Liam Neeson) whose suspicions that lead to his destructive actions are planted by Morgana. The joust between Lancelot and Gawain and the final surrender of Lancelot and Guinevere to their lust, leading to Arthur, finding them together asleep and naked in the forest and thrusting Excalibutr between them. Lancelot flees, sorrowfully exclaiming the doom of the kingdom and Arthur is struck by lightening in prayer.<br />Largely focuses on the relationship between Merlin and Morgana and the sorcery that Morgana uses to entrap Merlin. The ravages of time and the decay and suffering of the once great and thriving kingdom of King Arthur,  and the hunt for the Golden Grail.<br />Gruesome scenes of how the sinister young Mordred (Charley Boorman) lures Arthur's knights to their deaths. And the final battle between the forces of the evil Morgana and Mordred and King Arthur, where Mordred mortally wounds Arthur and is himself killed by Arthur with Exaclibur.<br />No effort was spared to make this a visual and sound extravaganza, with all the majesty, entrapment and darkness to make this the perfect Arthurian epic movie. Scenes of nudity/sex  and extreme violence make this an adults only movie.<br />This on a par with the 21st century Lord of the rings trilogy for its sheer captivation, majesty and unforgetability.scenes of how the sinister young Mordred (Charley Boorman) lures Arthur's knights to their deaths.

B0035J6TAI|4.0|I love the concept of this album -- PG doing covers of other artists' work.  All of the songs have a familiar sense to them and it's elusive as to where you've heard it before, as PG puts his own spin on each one.  The more often you listen to the album, the more it haunts you (in a good way).  Highly recommended.
B001FB563E|5.0|The Road is a slow-moving, existentialist post-apocalyptic film. If the lack of constant action every few minutes or fancy CG turns you off, this movie is not for you. But, if like me, you love the post-apocalyptic genre and don't mind slow, depressing, suspense films driven by dialog, this movie is worth checking out.<br /><br />Most of the film is bleak, depressing, and grey. The world has been destroyed, along with all the plants and animals in it. We don't know how or why or when. All that we're told is that \\"the clocks stopped at 1:15\\" through narration by a man (Viggo Mortensen) as he and his son trudge across a desolated landscape of dead trees, burned out cars, and rubble. An unspecified cataclysmic event has wiped out civilization and the humans that survived roam the land looking for fuel and food, some of whom are cannibalistic armed gangs. Perhaps it was an atomic detonation -- we're told that \\"there was a long shear of bright light then a series of low concussions.\\" But it doesn't matter. The lack of explanation helps adds to the feeling of disorientation, anonymity, isolation, and despair that is the core of this film. None of the characters in this film have a name, except for the old man towards the end (Eli, played by an unrecognizable Robert Duvall).<br /><br />It is the story of two people getting from unspecified Point A to unspecified Point B. Part of the story is told in flashbacks to the relationship between the man and his wife (Charlize Theron) in the days before and after the cataclysm. Father and son are making their way south on foot, which they believe to be warmer, sustaining themselves on the hope of finding other \\"good guys\\" like themselves. The winters are getting colder and the ailing father struggles to keep the two alive and doing whatever he can to retain what's left of his humanity. All they have to protect themselves is an old revolver with 2 bullets, one for each of them to take their own lives as a last resort. Along the way, they encounter dangers and ever-looming threats, mostly from thieves and roving gangs of cannibals. Some of these encounters are vividly and disturbingly portrayed. I find myself afraid to watch one particular scene again where victims are kept locked in a cellar, harvested for body parts, with noses and ears shown in a bloody bathroom sink. Most of the violence, however, happens off-screen or is implied with props, screams or sound effects. I find this more effective and creepier than actually seeing the violence directly.<br /><br />The film is simply wonderful to look at, for all its devastation and bleak environments. The filmmakers couldn't have done a better job picking the locations and dressing the sets. Mortensen turns in a solid performance, and there are two instances of backal nudity. That Viggo sure likes showing off what his mama done give him (see [[ASIN:B001EIOOWC Eastern Promises [Blu-ray]]] for the infamous naked sauna fight). Definitely give it a look. This film, I mean. Not Viggo's bum.r dangers and ever-looming threats, mostly from thieves and roving gangs of cannibals. Some of these encounters are vividly and disturbingly portrayed.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|This movie is a very accurate portrayal of life behind the iron curtain.  There is no question of right and wrong.  Instead, every decision is either for the state, or against the state.  If you make a decision against the state, you risk detection, imprisonment, and death.  The harsh realities of life in the Eastern Block are poignantly portrayed.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Without a doubt, this is a superb Blu-ray set and a MUST-HAVE for your video collection. Simply put, this series is about the struggle for life on planet Earth and the marvelous strategies that animals and plants have developed to survive, procreate, and pass on their genes. It features some of the most lavish and amazing nature shots ever filmed.<br /><br />I watch a lot of nature documentaries and I am continuously amazed, surprised, and impressed by what the BBC cinematographers manage to do, the rare and beautiful sights they are able to capture, and the artistry, dedication, and attention they devote to their work. I loved [[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series]], but I think I love Life even more because it spends more time with a smaller number of subject so you get to see more footage of their behavior. Whereas Planet Earth went for breadth, Life goes for depth. For example, each subject gets 5 minutes of screen time or more devoted to it.<br /><br />I would say what also separates this series from Planet Earth is that Life gets up close and personal, using a lot of macro shots and slow-motion photography whereas Planet Earth shows a lot of aerials, wide-shots, and panoramic vistas. Very often in Life is an extreme closeup, either in slow-motion, high-speed photography, or sped up in time-lapse, with the action all set to a perfectly orchestrated soundtrack. Within the first few minutes of Episode 1 (series overview/synopsis episode), you'll see the style of cinematography that runs through the series. For example, we see a chameleon in a tree stalking praying mantises and slow motion photography of its tongue shooting out to grab its prey. In another scene, we see a slow-motion hippo fight with gaping mouths and water artfully splashing around, set to dramatic music. In yet another scene (this time from Malaysia), we see another close-up of a strange insect swallowing in air and then forcing the bubbles up into its head to inflate its eyes like a balloon! This is the stalk-eyed fly, and I've never seen one in a nature show before. This is what characterizes Life: a continual parade of amazing photography and rare and beautiful sights, many of which have never been filmed before. It is also about the industriousness of animals and what they must do to ensure the survival of their young. The mudskipper, for example, is an extraordinary amphibious fish that digs a U-shaped tunnel to hatch its eggs. It gulps in air and brings it back to the eggs until they hatch, repeating the task thousands of times a day.<br /><br />Each episode is devoted into a particular subject matter:<br /><br />1. \\"Challenges of Life\\"<br />2. \\"Reptiles and Amphibians\\"<br />3. \\"Mammals\\"<br />4. \\"Fish\\"<br />5. \\"Birds\\"<br />6. \\"Insects\\"<br />7. \\"Hunters and Hunted\\"<br />8. \\"Creatures of the Deep\\"<br />9. \\"Plants\\"<br />10. \\"Primates\\"<br /><br />There's so much to see and love here that no review can sum up the sheer joy of watching it all. \\"Fish\\", \\"Creatures of the Deep\\" and \\"Plants\\" are my personal favorites, but there's so much to love in every episode. Some of the subjects, however, may be a bit repetitive, especially if you've seen other BBC/nature films. For example, I've seen plenty of the \\"common\\", ordinary animals like cheetahs, hippos, and elephants from countless other documentaries, and they're in Life too. The lammergeier (also known as the bearded vulture) I've seen on Planet Earth. In Life, they're back and in more detail, in particular, how they drop bones onto rocks from great heights to crack them open for the nourishing marrow fat. There's also narration that makes references to [[ASIN:B001W79MQS Nature's Most Amazing Events [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />At the end of each episode is an On Location featurette that takes you behind the scenes and shows you how some of the shots in this series were accomplished. It also shows you the great lengths that the film crew go to and all hard work that goes into bringing you these wonderful shots, as well as some of the innovative filming techniques they used. For example, one camera man hid in a hut for 28 days just to get the mating ritual of the Vogelkop bowerbird of Papua, New Guinea, a shot that is maybe 2 minutes long. In another, we see how the crew measures out a portion of English woodland and recreate the entire scene in their studio for a time-lapsed pullback shot of plants growing that took 2 years to complete.<br /><br />In summary, GET THIS BLU-RAY SET!! It is fantastic, and in my opinion, every bit as good as Planet Earth, if not better. If you don't come away from this series with a new appreciation of nature's ingenuity and the wonderful and fascinating creatures that inhabit our planet, you never will. Entertaining, informative, and genuinely fun to watch, this is nature programming at its very best.example, one camera man hid in a hut for 28 days just to get the mating ritual of the Vogelkop bowerbird of Papua, New Guinea, a shot that is maybe 2 minutes long.

B0012GMYI2|4.0|Restless and Wild would be the first of three strong releases from the German metal band Accept. Udo Dirkschneider's vocals never sounded meaner than they do here and the band's performance is spirited and hungry. The opening \\"Fast as a Shark\\" showed the band at their heaviest and is one of thrash metal's earliest and best statements. The mid-tempo \\"Princess of the Dawn\\" and the melodic \\"Don't Go Stealing My Soul Away\\" are two of the band's best tracks. Their trademark crunchy riffs and gang choruses are on full display on the anthems \\"Ahead of the Pack\\", \\"Demon's Night\\", and the menacing title song. Other strong tracks include \\"Neon Nights\\" and \\"Flash Rockin' Man\\"; the latter track's main riff would be borrowed by Iron Maiden on \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" a couple years later. The songs \\"Get Ready\\" and \\"Shake Your Heads\\" are okay but don't touch the rest of the album or anything on Balls to the Wall or Metal Heart. All told, Restless Wild is strong old-school metal and is worth owning or downloading.

B0027BOL4G|1.0|I enjoyed Eric Schlosser's book FAST FOOD NATION, so I thought I would enjoy this.  Wrong.  That book was coherent, entertaining, and reasonably well-argued.  This one jumps from point to point without giving time to contradictory viewpoints, or even acknowledging they exist.  I couldn't even get through the title sequence without yelling at the screen.<br /><br />These are not in any particular order:<br /><br />First of all, showing animals slaughtered is not an argument.  It never seems to occur to the filmmakers that many people are already aware that the animals they eat live short, awful lives in dark, cramped quarters -- and yet have no problem with it.  It was as though the mere sight of animals being butchered was going to be enough to put one off one's meat, but this is not the case for many people.<br /><br />Second:  the filmmakers look at data points only, not broad society-wide statistics.  The tale of the young boy dying from a freak outbreak of E. Coli was just that:  freak.  The movie made it seem like thousands and thousands are dying.  You're telling me that a billion-dollar industry needs to be shut down because of freak outbreaks now and then?<br /><br />Third:  never seems to occur to the filmmakers that the USDA might have some reasons for some of its requirements.  Take the prohibition against preparing meat in the open air.  It seems to me that one possible reason for this stricture might be, uh, flies and the effects of sunlight on raw meat.  But oh no!  The USDA is presented as a evil troll who hates sunlight and open air merely because it hates all joy and life.<br /><br />Fourth:  There was a boatload of irrelevant arguments thrown into this movie.  Am I supposed to feel guilty eating a cheeseburger because workers are forced to \\"do the same task again and again\\"?  Sheesh.  Welcome to the modern world!  That's how things are on my job, which has nothing to do with food.  And what about this:  the way the food is manufactured, we are told, has implications for \\"how corporations see other cultures.\\"  How is this relevant?  I don't care!  Corporations have always seen other cultures as resources to be exploited:  that's just in the nature of a corporation.  Even Apple, the darling company of liberals everywhere (bafflingly, to me), has no problem setting up grim factories in China, then selling the wares in shops in Riyadh.<br /><br />Fifth:  Does it ever occur to the filmmakers that if they got everything on their wish list, the population of the earth would have to decrease by a few billion?<br /><br />Sixth:  According to the filmmakers, if you are fat, that's not because you have no self-control:  it's because these evil conglomerates cleverly design food intended \\"to press our evolutionary buttons.\\"  Thus, we're helpless!  Okay, let's take this reasoning over the area of women dressing.  Nearly every day I see women walking down the street in mini-skirts and high heels and think, boy, I'd like to hit that.  Why, the way she's dressing is pressing my \\"evolutionary buttons.\\"  So does the responsibility lie with me to control my urges, or her . . . to veil?<br /><br />Seventh:  This film was the first I had ever heard of \\"food libel laws.\\"  I did some looking into them, as the way the film characterized them struck me as fishy.  You can't criticize a cheeseburger in Colorado?  That didn't sound right.  No, what it turns out to be is you can't make unsubstantiated claims about food being harmful and cause food industries and workers millions of dollars unless you can substantiate your claims.  If you can, though, it sure as shootin' is legal.  What you can't do is simply fire off wacky, unprovable accusations and send everybody into a panic.  In this way, the food libel laws, where they exist, are similar to libel laws against humans:  you ARE CERTAINLY ALLOWED TO SAY NEGATIVE THINGS in a public forum as long as they are a matter of public record or can be backed up.  The filmmakers absurdly moaningthat \\"you can't criticize food\\" is misleading:  they are deliberately conflating the idea of CRITICISM with UNFOUNDED ASSERTIONS.  Many, since the establishment of food libel laws, have since pointed out all sorts of stuff about what's in the food we eat without getting into hot water BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO BACK UP THEIR CLAIMS.  That lady interviewed on screen obviously couldn't, so, without knowing much more about her situation, I can only assume it was a good thing that she was gagged.  There's more, though:  the \\"food libel laws,\\" whether just or injust, must be a good deal weaker than the filmmakers characterization of them.  After all, this very film was replete with unsubstantiated accusations and yet I actually bought this DVD in Colorado.<br /><br />Having said all this, I do agree with some of the some of the movie's points:  agricultural subsidies are a cancer on the economy and yes, our food is too cheap and its price needs to rise so that the full social cost of living as we do can be clearly apprehended.  But when it comes to those points, I came to be convinced of them from reading other sources, not from seeing the arguments in this film.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be great if the DVD makers were forced to release this film with a commentary track with a couple of tech guys from the USDA responding to what you're seeing on the screen?ately conflating the idea of CRITICISM with UNFOUNDED ASSERTIONS.

0307588335|1.0|The narrative of this book is extremely painful. It was a kin to a bad case of IBS. I am uncertain as to the author's motive of littering the prose with Americanism. It was an excruciating experience and in my opinion unnecessary. Was the style of writing meant to evoke the bravado of Wall Street? Or perhaps the constant array of stylised American vernacular was meant to evoke the imagery  of the protagonist's surly road to success selling pork, whilst coping with an absent father and constantly aiming for something more. It is perhaps the all too common cliched story of the rags to riches self made man in 20th century America that I found thoroughly nauseating.   I would however have dismissed the author and his story had I not heard of it first  on an episode of BBC World News Hard Talk. Sure he appeared cocky and on the verge of doing the \\"I told you so\\" song and dance. But there I saw a man who was articulated and perfectly unimpaired by the unutterable lexicon of post-war Americana. I hope he wasn't compelled by his editors to produce a narrative to appeal to middle america, who needed an outlet to distill their anger and to find some sort of answer in the wake of the GFC.

I think it's a great book for anyone who has been through a difficult time in their life and who needs a \\"pick-me-up\\" to see that there's a whole different world out there to explore. Seeing as I love to travel, reading about the different countries was especially fun.

Viewing now the bluray on a large LED in the comfort of a home environment the cartoon movie is more beautiful than ever before. How the audio people took a mono sound track and made it into 7 channel sound is beyond belief. Individual orchestral instruments have a definite presence with the vocals also enhanced. There is rumbling bass when called for (but not too much). We decided it best to view Snow White and her little helpers on normal 4:3 format and not the so called Disney View where the black edges are filled by varying coloured art-work....this sort of takes away the attention from the movie itself.  Loved those \\"extras\\" so many infact that some had to be included on the feature disc.   Those at Disney should consider actually making the proposed \\"Snow White\\" II, sketchy details of which were shown on the extras disc.  Stephen J Fleay  Bandung Java Indonesia

1594481717|5.0|A Whole New Mind By Dan Pink (Riverhead Books, 2006). Reviewed by Steve Gladis,Ph.D.<br /><br />Just as Picasso was in his \\"blue period,\\" I think I'm in my \\"pink period\\"...Dan Pink that is. I just read A Whole New Mind, which I should have read years before, and which I think describes me better than my mother would have. In fact, I think Pink and I may have come from the same mother ;). Cherished for years and oft repeated in whole or part: \\"The truth is, a great mind must be androgynous\\" (Samuel Taylor Coleridge). In this book, Pink helped me understand once and for all why as a poet masquerading as an FBI agent, I always felt \\"weird.\\"  A right-brainer living in a world of alpha left-brainers. Perhaps that's why Dan (a lawyer by education) ended up as a speechwriter for Al Gore, and I ended up writing speeches for several directors of the FBI. Could we have been twins separated at birth?<br /><br />He argues convincingly that we're moving from an Information Age to a Conceptual (creative/inventive) Age, because of:  Abundance (we're living at the top of Maslow's hierarchy of needs), Asia (left-brained work is outsourced there because it's been commoditized, and thus cheaper), and Automation (things that are solved by a strict set of rules--heuristics--are better crunched by microchips).  He argues that in the coming age those with more inventive minds will be more valued. And he argues these points well--remember Dan's a lawyer--at least, a recovering one.<br /><br />In the rest of the book, Dan describes what he calls the \\"Six Senses .\\" 1) Design--making things not only functional but engaging by design; 2) Story--developing a compelling narrative from the data; 3) Symphony--seeing the big picture and gathering  seemingly desperate parts into a harmonious whole; 4) Empathy--fostering caring relationships with our family, friends and colleagues at work; 5) Play--the need to have fun at whatever you do; 6) Meaning--seeking purpose and the greater good seems to define us uniquely as humans.<br /><br />I'll be reviewing Dan's book in some depth on my blog: [...]. I highly recommend you buy a copy and underline the hell out of it as I did. There's a ton of useful, important information that I won't have the space to mention.

0393075966|3.0|The book promisses much more than it holds. The description of what has happened in the US economy is accurate (the only good thing I can say about the book) although incomplete. Professor Stiglitz is full of criticisms of the actions or non-actions by the Obama government without considering the reasons, political or otherwise, that induced it to make compromises and, among other things, appoint government secretaries, who may have been known to give support to \\"the other side\\". The text contains many repetitions and when one finally reaches the last chapter \\"Toward a new Society\\" and expects to find proposals, one is again disappointed: the author only advances criticism of using the GDP (gross domestic product) rather than \\"the well-being of the members of society, however that is defined\\"!

B0039UTDFG|3.0|This is the first time I write a review on amazon, but I just had to say something about the Us version of LIFE, the blue ray is amazing but Oprah narrating is awful, just get the UK version
B001NLKWLW|5.0|even after the book has ended. I thought about this story for days. (Some books just have that effect on me, especially if they are really good!)  An Excellent book. I thought the character development was good and the story intriguing. I couldn't put it down. (I didn't notice any confusion of characters that some reviewers spoke about, that had to go back and re-check or write out a family tree for reference.)   I'm an avid reader (I read 2-3 books a week) and this is one of my favorite books over the last 6 months.  I was sorry to see it end. I'd recommend this book to all my friends and family. You just have to read this story, it's a gem!  I will be on the lookout for any new Books by Kate Morton!
0385341008|5.0|I bought this book when it first came out and finally picked it up the other day, as the first of this years summer reads.  I tried to take my time reading it, it's pure joy and heartbreak. I was fascinated with the people of Guernsey, and would love to visit there.  Can's recommend this book enough!
B000IU3XU6|5.0|This is one of the most wonderful concerts I have ever seen. After watching, now I know why its hard to get to Josh as far as his concerts. His ticket prices are huge, but its so worth every penny! I cannot stop playing it and he has gained many more fans since I make everyone who visits watch with me. LOL His voice is angelical, his energy is fantastic, but he can't dance and will tell you so! ha! He doesn't need to....
0380713802|1.0|Neither interesting, nor funny. Neither entertaining, nor educational. Neither provacative nor engaging.<br /><br />Awful.<br /><br />Not funny.<br /><br />Maybe I've travelled too much to appreciate this book, but it was awful, bordering on offensive. I would have thought that Bryson would be an enthusiastic and passionate traveler, but he wasn't. At least not in this book. In this book he was bitter, whiney and did nothing but complain.<br /><br />Let me sum up the book for you:<br /><br />EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE<br />the food is bad<br />People are different than him, therefore, awful<br />something poop related<br /><br />He bashed the culture of every country visited in some way. When he was in Switzerland and bored he made up some riddles. Here's one: \\"What do you call a gathering of boring people in Switzerland?\\" ... \\"Zurich.\\"<br /><br />Every once in a while something seemingly positive would happen, and I would think ... maybe ... maybe he's going to have ONE good experience on this trip. But nope. Always a \\"but\\". Murphy's Law always right around Bill Bryson's corner.<br /><br />I'm shocked that this book was published. I've written better travel commentary on the back of an American Airlines cocktail napkin.
B003E8AF5U|4.0|When I first got this album I certainly wasn't wowed immediately as I was with their debut, but I knew that with a few listens it would grow on me. It lacks the hooks of the first album yes, but this is more rewarding in the long run and much more of a albums album. The poppier songs on their first album eventually lost their initial greatness I felt and then the more artsy album tracks sink in and take hold. This new album is just a matter of sinking in, but when it does you will be satisfied. Stop comparing it to Oracular and take a little more time to appreciate this. Its just as good as the first if not better.
0810993139|5.0|This book is the greatest because so many exciting things happen.  My favorite part is when his dad got angry and... (i can't tell you this part).  I liked the wimpy kid because he always gets embarrassed and his brother is always mean and I know a lot about stuff like this because someone in my family is mean to me.  Meg

B000JIHP88|5.0|Someone else mentioned that this was not loud enough. I have to admit I was surprised how \\"mellow\\" the tunes were as mobiles we have had in the past have been much \\"brighter.\\" However our little guy doesn't seem to complain & I LOVE the Rainforest \\"medley.\\" I have found that if he wakes up a little too early for my liking & certainly way too early for music LOL! I can turn on the Rainforest & he will happily lie there looking at the animals going around & we can go back to sleep for those precious few more minutes. It's quiet enough not to disturb us but loud enough to keep him occupied.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I'm as particular as anyone I know about sound quality and can definitely recognize a recording that is sub-par.  This concert is not one of them.  The engineers have nothing to be \\"ashamed\\" about.  First of all, this live recording sounds different from others because of the intimate setting.  The Troubadour is a tiny club, not a 25,000 seat arena.  The dvd is great too, very enjoyable.
B000002N3N|5.0|The second Enya CD I purchased for my extensive music collection has left me filled with peaceful joy.  Enya is the partnership formed by Eithne Ni Bhraonain (Enya herself), Nicky and Roma Ryan.  Born is Donegal, Ireland, Enya studied classical music under private tuition until she was discovered by producer Nicky Ryan.  Along with his wife Roma, the trio grew into one of the most notorious musical talents of the New Age era.  Personally, I find Roma to be the most impressive one of the three, as she is responsible for writing the most beautiful lyrics in almost any language one can expect (she has her own website and it is a true testament to creativity with style - do pay a visit).<br /><br />This CD includes songs in English, Spanish, Latin and Celtic.  The rhythms are light and airy, befitting a body of work allegoric to nature.  My favorite song is \\"Anywhere is\\", with exquisite lyrics by Roma Ryan about the continuity of time and how we always seem to be at its mercy - \\"I might be just beginning, I might be near the end\\" sings Enya at the closing of the song.  The Spanish-written \\"La So'adora\\" tells of the fleeting passing of the seasons through the perennial life cycle.  There are also instrumental songs like \\"Tea House Moon\\", which I can perfectly imagine as background music during a Japanese tea ceremony.<br /><br />The album design is exquisite, with Enya wearing a royal blue velvet robe created by Elizabeth Emanuel exclusively for the photo shoot, which makes her look like an eternal Celtic goddess in her golden throne. In these days of global warming worries, this CD is a gift to the memory of a planet which we ourselves are destroying.

0393072231|5.0|I'm flat out appalled after reading Michael Lewis's book The Big Short.     I'm all for Michael Lewis and also the clever little guys who figgered out the big short trade; they were the colorful and interesting foci of the book.     But I'm appalled the financial institutional setting and culture that allowed the situation of the financial implosion to develop. It was and is far worse than i thought. The big financial firms owned both the casinos (the financial markets) and the very government agencies regulating them.     So long as the jaw dropping incentives were in place and the investment banks were making huge money, upper management didn't care about the devil in the details. Clearly, nobody was minding the store. What's worse is that, despite the shocking incentives, maybe, nobody understood the financial instruments (bonds, exotic derivatives, CPOs, etc) they were selling; and nobody seemed to to care that the underlying mortgage loans were created by fraud and malpractice.     And what about the financial lobbyists who allowed this financial melt down to happen?: many of whom were the actual government officials and elected representatives whose job was to prevent, regulate and control.    And what about the government's damage control role during and after the meltdown? What about the government officials who bailed out the perpetrator firms with billions of TARP dollars and trillions of dollars of government guarantees? And what about the media who sold the whole hoax to the congress and to us.     And worse yet, these officials are still with us: a group of mercenaries passed on to the new president and the new regime. After the financial deluge and the bail out, financially, it looks very much like business as usual (no matter how bad business is).     For the above reasons, Obama didn't have a chance of getting financial reform right. It's my bet that meaningful financial reform will not happen without near total financial collapse.    (And i do findit more than interesting that there was no honest resale market for the CDOs the financial institutions had created and sold. The little guys who figgered out trade, the big short itself, initially, could not derive their fair value from their CDOs because the resale market in was rigged by the insiders, the investment bankers. The little short guys could not sell their CDOs until the financial avalanche was actually sliding down the mountain of deceit.)

1402760663|5.0|I love this book.<br />i got a paperback version and was rivetted with the accounts presented.<br />It is a book that makes uncomfortable reading in the light of environmental issues so prominent today, and also America's role in championing the cause of the abused and displaced.<br />\\"The land of the free\\" is a hollow sounding claim when the blood of thousands of Indians cries out for justice, wiped out by the advancing super race of Americans.<br />I wonder if Adolf Hitler ever complained of American interference in Germany's attempt to wipe out the jews,given what was done to native Americans, or maybe he looked to American history for some good ideas.<br /><br />This illustrated Edition of Dee Browns masterpiece is enthralling and brought to life with the illustrations, photographs and additional comments from various sources.<br />If you, like me thought John Wayne and others who sat tall in the saddle were the epitomy of the American cowboy fighting the Indian menace, this book will destroy that myth forever.

0938045695|1.0|There is no way a normal person can do the 2 basic exercises this book suggests to start a fitness program.   The first one, the swing, is ok. The second one, the Turkish get up forget about. I doubt most out of shape people can do this exercise without a kettle bell. The book also suggest starting out, for a normal male, with a 35 lb bell. This is to heavy for an unconditioned person or one who has not exercised in a while.  If you have been working with kettle bells or have had individual instruction than this book has a lot of useful information.   I bought both the DVD and book which is a waste of money for someone new to kettle bells and looking to get in shape. Go find a certified instructor and spend the money on that and also try different weight bells to start out with.

B00364K6YW|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is hands down the best one. It tracks closest to the book than all the other versions of P&P out there, including the more recent ones.  When you watch it, you are seeing the real Jane Austin. The writers/directors/producers did an exceptional job.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I am very disappointed with this video collection. Although someone went thru a lot of trouble to collect this amazing footage, I keep seeing the same scenes repeated over and over, even from one disc to another.  For example, on disc 1 there is some video footage of ibex deer climbing on a mountain. Later on the same disc, you see part of the same scene repeated for another segment. Then on disc 3, the scene is repeated again, but with Oprah providing different narrative. There is another segment on disc 1 of three cheetahs hunting an ostrich successfully. Again, on disc 3, the same scene of the cheetahs hunting the ostrich is repeated, but with Oprah providing different narrative. Jeers to the producer, editor, and to Oprah for knowingly releasing such a poor documentary yet charging such an expensive price to an unsuspecting public expecting quality.    Additionally, apparently neither the scriptwriter nor Oprah know how to speak proper English grammar. For example, Oprah begins a sentence in one of her narratives with the words \\"It's got....\\". I am not an expert in journalism or in English usage, but even I know that the proper way of beginning the sentence should have been with \\"It has....\\". Come on! I would expect better from something that is supposedly intended to be educational and informative.    1 star out of 5.
0143038419|1.0|I was given this book as a gift and therefore, felt obligated to read it (irrational perhaps). Because I heard so much about it and also because Julia Roberts will star in a movie, I thought it may have some substance. I found little in this regard and agree with the reviewers who thought it was trite and self-absorbed, also a bit hypocritical because of the way Liz financed her trip. I could read travel books and Yoga books and get more. The most difficult part for me however, was that Liz is unaware of the negative disability language she uses. \\"Mentally handicapped\\" and \\"spazzing out\\" which she uses frequently, have been off the radar as condescending to people with disabilities. Particulary the use of spaz, which most of us know even if we are not writers. I do not think this is being over-sensitive, just that good writers who also write for young adults should make an attempt to eliminate language which promotes negative images. I attempted to contact Liz myself, but there is no way to do this on her website. Thanks, I will try to finish the book...
0937381888|5.0|I bought this book as a starting point because I had never tried home brewing. As a complete newbie I found the language very easy to follow and very informative. I loved the organization of the book as well. Knowing that everyone who picked up the book would be ready to brew, the author started with a \\"quick start\\" guide to get us going. The rest of the book provides a wealth of information, and gives hombrewers the change to learn progressively and dig as deep as they want. As a novice home brewer I continue to refer to this book every time I brew a batch. If you are new to home brewing and want a one-stop shop book to learn and use as a reference, How to Brew is for you.

B0039TD7PY|5.0|Growing up listening to singer songwriters like James Taylor & Carole King, I found this CD on Amazon.  I admit I was hesitant at first after having purchased Carole's Tapestry Album and all of James Taylors, from Vinyl to 8 track, cassette and finally to CD.  I thought what could be different about this CD.  I was more than pleasantly surprised, the Live At The Troubador CD brings together two brilliant singer songwriters whose voices are as clear and harmonious today as they were years ago.  It was like having my own personal concert.  I can't urge you enough to purchase this CD/DVD Combo, and with the price that Amazon offers it for.......it's a steal.
006621131X|3.0|I had read several reviews of this memoir before picking it up and was expecting something more compelling.  I very much enjoyed a number of sequences in this work (the early, hard days in New York and Robert's dying), but there were many things that kept it from being the book it should have been.  One thing that absolutely drove me crazy was Patti Smith's tin ear for prose.  Although she is a remarkable poet and song writer, her prose has a Victorian feel to it that is finally for me distracting.  I also was disappointed in her inability to talk about her own art in a way that seemed convincing.  She seems more concerned about what she wore when she created something than what she was thinking or feeling.
0375420525|5.0|I bought this book because a few friends had mentioned it in passing, and I had read about it online a little bit, and I was intrigued.  I am not an avid reader, an English literature student, or a college professor, so take my praise for what it is worth, but I enjoyed this book thoroughly and would recommend it to anyone open to the experience of reading who wants to try something a little different.    It is a deeply unsettling novel.  I think it flows well, it seems to be intentionally dense, intentionally vague about characters.  It is supremely easy to get lost and not be able to follow the timeline.  I did not, and I suggest you don't, read about the plot and characters and interesting formatting before you start the book.  This was a book that I enjoyed sneaking up on me.    It's relatively long, and although some passages will go very quickly and you'll devour them, some will be long and tedious (and only serve to make the short passages that much more exciting, in my experience).  I read just about every word, and I don't regret it at all.  In fact, I liked it so much that I just bought his next book last night.    Note: I do not recommend this book to people who need a certain amount of character development, who need to always be interested every moment, or do not understand the difference between overbearing academic criticism for its own sake and overbearing academic criticism as a literary device.
0425206211|4.0|This is about the fourth Reacher book that I've read and I enjoyed it about as much as any. At the beginning and well into the book the reader is kept in the dark about what is really going on. Then, when the reader is allowed in on the real plot, it becomes a real adventure. Since we know that there are subsequent Reacher books, we know that Reacher is going to live. For a time, however, this is somewhat doubtful. There's a lot of action, the usual love interest, some pretty good people and some real doofuses involved. Oh, and some real evil, too.

B0015DROBO|4.0|The story really caught my attention all the way through. This book was different from other mystery novels I've read in that the author spent a lot of time developing the main characters before even really getting to the mystery that they're supposed to solve. I feel that because of this I came to really like the main characters, especially Lisbeth Salander. There were some disturbing scenes and some themes that are definitely not suitable for children to read.

The mixture of his adventures being intertwined with his work on quantum theory was better then anything I've ever read.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|AVATAR is unlike any film I've ever seen.  The envisioning of Pandora itself is mind-boggling; the performance capture effects unlike anything previously seen; while the script is nothing overly outstanding, the movie's epic scale and sheer entertainment value is what movie-making should be and ultimately should have won Oscars for both Cameron and the Best Picture.  It's an amazing feat.

Mortensen,Harris,Irons and Zellweger...<br />The story plot is as real as life itself...And you will see at the end of the movie that sometimes things are not<br />as they look...or may be the opposite...This was for me the main message.<br />The fact that I am from the River Plate makes me feel a special sympathy for Viggo Mortensen that as I said played a great role in this movie<br />I recommend this movie to all people interested in good cinema
B00005JLWN|1.0|It's hard to understand, exactly, why this film has so many supporters and not enough detractors. This film attempts to mix together every half-handed, lazy attempt at \\"deep\\" sci-fi ideas into one incomprehensible (and staggeringly ridiculous) film. The plot is essentially a mash-up of Fahrenheit 451, A Brave New World, 1984 and silly fight scenes ala The Matrix (a film that this piece of crap is destined to be endlessly compared to). While neither The Matrix nor Equilibrium is entirely original in its presentation of original material, this film suffers from a severe heavy-handedness that The Matrix largely avoided... that is, until the two miserable sequels were created in an attempt to completely bombard you with pseudo-religious allegory. But anyways, The Matrix has its own problems, none of which are as severe as this film's problems. First, there's the basic premise: that human emotions are the cause for all of society's ills and, as such, must be controlled and maintained in order to avoid any further outbreak of war. How is this accomplished? By having society endlessly doped up on \\"Prozium\\" (which is as thin as a metaphor for any film-related item I've heard until James Cameron dropped \\"Unobtanium\\" on us) which neutralizes all human emotion. However, so many of the characters in this film react emotionally that it busts this premise right from the get-go. Several characters are shown smiling (Taye Diggs' character in particular seems to really be enjoying his job), reacting angrily (the government appears to be pretty bloodthirsty when it comes to \\"sense offenders\\" - yet another term I can't stop laughing at whenever someone mentions it in the film) and acting surprised (one guard drops an f-bomb when he realizes the fit is about to hit the shan). These are all emotions. Already, this simple premise is doo-doo. Next up is some gun-fu, which admittedly, does look pretty cool, but is entirely dependent upon the targets standing motionless in a line or a circle for it to work properly (speaking of, what military personnel in their right mind would stand in a circle in order to shoot a suspect? Apparently, the concept of crossfire has been lost in the future. However, since these guys are mostly cannon fodder, it doesn't really matter. Seriously, I haven't seen a military force this inept since the stormtroopers from the original \\"Star Wars\\" who also couldn't hit the broadside of a barn.) Want some other gaping plot holes? This film's got a-plenty: \\"Father\\" is so paranoid of assassination attempts that almost no one is allowed to see him directly without being disarmed or at the mercy of snipers - however, since a pat-down is also a foreign concept in the future, no one bothers to actually make sure that Christian Bale has no weapons when meeting with him. Also, there are no snipers present... ever. Additionally, all of \\"Father's\\" elite guards are pretty easily dispatched (they also subscribe to the tactic of lining up in a circle, waiting to be killed.) The entire premise of an emotionless society is pretty loosely enforced, considering most people have to take their \\"Prozium\\" themselves and it's pretty easy to pretend like you are even when you aren't. Books, music and artwork are considered outlawed and are immediately destroyed in this dystopian future... that is, unless you work in the department that decides what is outlawed, in which case statues and ornate architecture are okay for display in your central offices. In the future, most of the sense-inducing outlawed art, books and music are pre-1950, with very little of the last 50 years having survived (which seems highly unlikely considering that there's not an incredible abundance of that stuff now.) However, it is incredibly easy to obtain any of this on the black market and most citizens who are off the \\"Prozium\\" don't do a very good job of hiding what they get. I could go on, but you get the picture. At the end of the day, this film is pretty terrible despitethe plethora of people on here who say otherwise. This is one of those movies that defines the \\"style over substance\\" genre of filmmaking that is so prevalent nowadays (you know, that genre that says nothing needs to make any sense, just as long as it looks really cool) and the film doesn't really say anything new in the sci-fi, future dystopia genre that hasn't been said elsewhere in a much better way. From the costumes to the fight scenes to certain story elements, it's pretty much unavoidable to compare this film with The Matrix and it made me wonder how much better The Matrix would have been with Christian Bale as Neo while having the naturally emotionless Keanu Reeves tackle the role of Cleric John in this film. I guess the world will never know and trust me when I tell you, you won't be missing much if you don't know about this film.
0143038419|5.0|As I begin to write this, there's 2085 reviews, of those, 997 are 5-Star reviews so it's daunting to think that I might be able to add anything of value with this review.  I will start by saying that I agree with everything the 5-Star reviewers I read said (maybe 10) and I disagree with all that the 1 & 2-Star reviewers I read said (maybe another 10).  I just loved this book, I found it a thoroughly delightful memoir... entertaining, laugh-out-loud funny, insightful, uplifting and even healing.  I could go into greater detail, but I doubt there's a single thing I could add to what has already been written, save one thing: I \\"read\\" the book in Audio... unabridged, CD audio format.  It's read by the author (sometimes a huge mistake, after all the skills of an author may not translate well into skills as a reader,) in this case that's a delight.  It occurred to me as I puzzled over some of the more unflattering reviews, that perhaps something about the book did not translate well to a written format.  Perhaps something about the story is better conveyed by the author in her reading?  I don't know... but if you've still got the energy for it, those of you who didn't like the book, perhaps try the Audio?  And those of you who have not yet read the book, perhaps try the audio version instead of the written one?

B002VPE1B6|4.0|I didn't get to see the film in the theater, for one reason or another, and I really regret missing the 3d version.  I for one will see it in the theater if and when they re-release it; milking for more money aside.  I watched the movie twice the first weekend I received it and continue to watch with much intrigue.  I was in awe, and only more disappointed in the fact that I missed it in theaters.  Yes this is a bare bones release, without any extras.  Normally I don't care, but having seen some clips online showing the making of the film, I can see where people would want more.  I can't say whether or not I would purchase it again for the extra content, I do know that I didn't hesitate to buy this version.  I can appreciate the technology used to make this movie, and I am very interested in future story lines and the rumored prequel novel that Cameron may write.  His whole imaginative world succeeded in drawing me in.<br />I'm trying to rate the actual product and not the film itself, which is why I gave it 4 stars; missing much anticipated extra content, but for $20 can you really complain.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a great game you can take anywhere. Fast to learn and fast to play. It is quite addictive - my son and I were going to have a couple of games but we ended-up playing for about an hour. Go and buy - you won't regret it.
B00004YA0T|5.0|I bought this music based on my love of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra's recordings of Bruckner's Seventh and Ninth symphonies with Telarc. I thought I might enjoy all of Bruckner's other symphonies. I was right.    The sound quality of these recordings is excellent, and the music is beautiful. I especially like the first movement of the Sixth symphony. It sounds like the music of Heaven here on earth.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie is absolutely captivating from start to finish.  Truly inspirational.  My entire family enjoyed this movie several times!
B0036EH40Q|3.0|I've owned this movie on laserdisc and DVD and was really looking forward to the Blu-ray edition. Unlike other reviewers here I was quite disappointed with the quality. I first watched this on my 120\\" front projection system and then again on my 42\\" plasma. The picture was darker then previous versions, colors somewhat unnatural with obvious black crush in many scenes. The most detail is obvious on close-ups. Medium and long shots less so. On the positive side this is the best it has looked and sounded so far. So in spite of all of this if you are a fan of this movie you're probably going to get it anyway.
B001IAP9MU|5.0|these book are prefect for summer reading nothing like taking your best friends to the beach or just to sit in the back yard. this entire series is just great I am already planning on rereading the whole set of books

B000005YZM|4.0|Before the album, the story, morning glory.<br /><br />If the fact this album was released in 1968 and not 1967 surprises you, it did me too. Rock by 1968 was starting back to the roots and was becoming a much rougher beast with bands like Blue Cheer.<br /><br />But 1967 fits, because it was actually recorded that year. The Zombies finished in the fall, and the album was mixed in mono: big mistake, because by early 1968, mono was being phased out and the Zombies label demanded Stereo, by which point the Zombies--mainly Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone--were fighting, and the band needed to dip into their royalties for the stereo mixdown. (If you wanna know why so many great bands wound up broke, this is a great case in point.)<br /><br />THEN Clive Davis at CBS decided not to release the album, until superhero Al Kooper, who had heard the album and was a big wig at CBS, changed Davis' mind.<br /><br />So, is Odessey and Oracle the masterpiece many of my fellow reviewers seem to think it is?<br /><br />I would say yes. A POP masterpiece--let me explain. Sgt. Pepper would be the obvious comparison, but I feel this misses the mark. Pepper was about the wonder in the air in 1967, and was about bringing more musical forms to rock. Odessey and Oracle is about the end of World War I, much more quintessentally English, based on piano based songs and traditional forms. There is not a sitar or an acid trip within ten miles of this album.<br /><br />If anything, the Kinks [[ASIN:B000002KOI The Village Green Preservation Society]]  or even the Beach Boys [[ASIN:B00005ASHM Pet Sounds]] would be better benchmarks to work from when framing Odessey and Oracle. Both these albums sonically unify older formats into thematic 1960s masterpieces, as does this album.<br /><br />But each song here is  a bath of harmony and terrific songwriting, and the World War I theme, which is anti-violent, is the one element that really does set the album in 1968. As an album as opposed to a collection of singles, Odessey and Oracle does work as well as Pepper, Village Green, or Pet Sounds.<br /><br />And go figure, \\"Time Of The Season,\\" with its erotic breaths and free-love subtext is the hit single. Who would have thought?er, Village Green, or Pet Sounds.     And go figure, \\"Time Of The Season,\\" with its erotic breaths and free-love subtext is the hit single. Who would have thought?

B00007GZR5|5.0|I have purchased products from this seller before and as always, prompt delivery and appropriate packaging.
B00005JL0I|1.0|Oh how i wish i had listened to those who said this was a bad movie. It is TRULY bad, but not bad good like an Ed Wood movie, it's just bad bad bad. Save your money. Save your life. Save your time, save your friends and family the trauma of watching even part of this awful mess. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. If you happened to be passing by a tv with this movie on, run away.<br />Part 1, the stupid premise - more than one James Bond. Part 2, the part in Scotland - too long, too much talking, nothing happens, it degrades into a drunk fest. Part 3, the middle mess. Part 5, the end becomes a 3-stooges punch-throwing fight with random chimpanzee, horses, Cowboys and Indians, STOOPID. I want my money back!
B0000009S3|5.0|I love this record from the creepy cover to all the chops within.   People who don't usually like Zappa can get into this on purely musical levels.
1423113381|5.0|Ordered this book for my 10 yr old son, but my husband and I enjoyed it as well. Rick Riordan is a very talented author, we loved the Percy Jackson series and will surely enjoy this series too.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I'm very glad I bought this product. I love being able to focus, then shoot with the remote trigger. The trigger also has a lock to hold it down for multiple exposures. I just have more control with this corded remote vs my wireless remote. My only complaint is the length. My previous remote cord I bought was 6ft. This was great for shooting birds at a feeder, etc. This cord is only 41\\" long, so it's quite a bit short than my previous remote. I didn't read the product description carefully enough before I purchased. I didn't return it because I ended up using it a lot for portrait work. I will add a longer one to my kit later.

B00081912E|4.0|Me, a devout comic book fan, must admit that, in this instance, it's the movie which made me seek its comic book source from Dark Horse. THE MASK - and, before it, ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE - catapulted Jim Carrey to superstardom in the early '90s. And, of the two, THE MASK is easily the more widely appealing, more audience friendly picture. It takes a certain taste to really appreciate the macabre, really odd bird that is ACE VENTURA. The plot to THE MASK is sketchy at best but damn if it isn't festooned with several moments which I call sheer movie magic.<br /><br />In Edge City, bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss is one of them meek pushovers you and I often tend to step on. Every day Stanley takes in all the abuse and lets it fester, and then one evening, after getting tossed out of a club he never even got into, he ends up on an empty bridge, finds a curious wooden mask floating in the river. Later we'll learn that the mask is possibly of Scandinavian origin and possibly belonged to Loki, the Norse god of mischief. We learn even sooner that the mask harbors very peculiar properties. That it bends reality, that it manifests the wearer's inner desires, relaxes inhibitions. Stanley Ipkiss has tons of suppressed inner desires. When he dons the mask, the movie really takes off.<br /><br />This movie, in its design, fosters elements of 1940s film noir and those wacky classic Warner Brothers cartoons. And if that combination doesn't intrigue you, then how about this mention of Cameron Diaz's sexy debut? One of the interesting twists in this film is that while Stanley Ipkiss meets two lovely ladies - a feisty girl reporter (Amy Yasbeck) and a slinky blonde chanteuse who's also a gangster's moll (Diaz) - the femme fatale turns out not to be the obvious one. Diaz and Carrey surprisingly drum up some good chemistry. Surprisingly, because when you think of Jim Carrey, you don't instantly assume, hey, romantic leading guy... Peter Reigert, by the way, does his best to ground the story with his irascible and deadpan police detective, but it's always a lost cause when Carrey is on the set running wild and mugging for all he's worth. Even that awesome Jack Russell terrier dog gets upstaged.<br /><br />You just have to endure the moments when Stanley Ipkiss is being Stanley Ipkiss, good-hearted and polite and excruciatingly dull. But I didn't come to this film to watch a doormat at work. The real meat of the story is whenever Ipkiss puts on the mask and we then see that loony character with the green face and tombstone teeth and those garish zoot suits. This is the personification of Stanley's deepest, most pent-up urges, and it's a good thing for the citizens of Edge City that this id is predominantly playful and works off Tex Avery cartoons. As the Mask, Stanley strikes a pose and declares: \\"With these powers, I could be a superhero, fight crime, work for world peace. But first...\\" Even a nice guy like Stanley is prone to petty little acts of get-back. Oh, I pray for those two poor auto mechanics... but they deserved it.<br /><br />ILM steps in to handle the Mask's eyes googling off the sockets and his heart throbbing out and that inner wolf cavorting, but I wouldn't have been surprised if Carrey had managed all that by himself - that's how uber-malleable his face is, how rubbery his frame is. Jim Carrey himself is a walking, talking Tex Avery cartoon and that's even before he puts on his makeup. This film is perfectly suited to his manic improvisational talents.<br /><br />There are gangsters here, of course, but the Mask treats them more like props in his routines. The Mask's powers are so insidious that you never get the sense that he's really in any sort of danger. You're just left waiting for the next burst of crazy or the next musical number. There are two absolutely magical moments in this film for me, and they're both musical numbers. Carrey and Diaz exuberantly dancing in the Coco Bongo club to \\"Hey Pachuco!\\" Then Carrey turns the tables on an army of hardened cops and leads them in a conga line while singing \\"Cuban Pete.\\" It's neat that the Mask demonstrates a knack for sucking everyone in vicinity into his world of playful anarchy. It's too bad that the film makes it a point that not everyone's inner persona is so playful. Someone else puts on the mask, and you instantly note the difference.<br /><br />By the way, unlike most of the scuzzy guys implied in this film, not for one moment did I ever think monogamy was some kind of wood.es on an army of hardened cops and leads them in a conga line while singing \\"Cuban Pete.\\" It's neat that the Mask demonstrates a knack for sucking everyone in vicinity into his world of playful anarchy.

B003ELOQCK|5.0|This review is for U2-360 At the Rose Bowl dvd edition. Just watched this last night and think it's one the best U2 live dvds to come out second to only U2 Live in Dublin. Viewed this on a 20in TV with no surround sound but as far as the 2.0 stereo track, it sounded awesome. Performance wise this is an amazing show. Really like the live versions of the new songs especially I'll Go Crazy IF I Don't Go Crazy Tonight and the highlight for me was The Unforgettable Fire which is the best version of that song I've ever heard. The editing of the show especially on Get On Your Boots was very frantic and hard to watch on a small TV but most of the rest of the show flowed more smoothly. Definetely check it out if you're a fan of The Joshua Tree or the last few U2 albums.
B001R60ESE|5.0|I love this disk! I heard part of it on PBS. I then rented the regular DVD from NetFlix and loved it. I decided to pay the premium and bought the Blu-Ray edition. This disc would be perfect as a demo disc in a high-end audio-video store. The music is fabulous. Chris's trumpet work is beautiful. His ensemble of players is first-rate and his guests are great. I have played this disk many, many times and each time is a treat. 'I've Got You Under My Skin' featuring Katharine McPhee made me fall in love. There are cuts that bliss me out, especially 'Cinema Paradiso' featuring Yo-Yo Ma. A spectacularly beautiful piece. Tears of joy run down my cheeks.    The bonus Feature: \\"Behind the Scenes - Chris Botti in Boston\\" (40 min.) is also excellent.    This disc is reason enough to buy a Blu-ray player. I am about to buy a copy for my brother and sister to share the joy
B001EYU1VO|3.0|I purchased the Saitek cyborg X from best buy as it was only $2 more than amazon and I realy wanted to play there and then.    I was really excited to get it out of the box when I got home.  It came packaged very well, everything was secure, so tightly packed, I would recommend pliers to cut the tie-wraps, so 9/10 for packaging.    When you get the joystick out of the box, you will find that it comes in two pieces.  This in itself is quite a unique concept, you will either love it or hate it.  I think the idea is so that you can dismantle the cyborg x which allows for great space saving.  The great fact that it really takes no more than 5 seconds to put together and take apart is the key.  Now for me this wasn't a selling point, I haven't taken it apart since I purchased it, however if you are short on space and would like to put this away, this could be a really usful feature for you.  8/10 for storability.    Right then, the most important part, playability.  The only reason I bought the joystick was to play Flight Simulator.  I'm going to have to be honest, for me the cyborg x does not do flight simulator any justice.  I think if you are using it for an arcade flying game then it would be fine, and would work great right out of the box but for flight simulator, it requires a great deal of tweaking.  As a lot of people have already mentioned, the cyborg x does have an unfortunate flaw.  There is i slight wobble from the centre of the stick.  That is, even with the deadzone completely set to nothing, you could move the stick anywhere up to 5-7mm in any direction before the input will be noticed.  This can make landings annoying and perhaps tricky, especially if you are flying with cross winds.  I also found that because of the wobble, when the stick does pickup an input, it will typically make large over correctments.  This led to several hours of tweaking until I became comfortable and confident to fly in flight simulator.  Unfortunately because of this I have togive it a 5/10 for playability.    To summarize, the joystick looks really good, and very unique, and with the blue LEDS on the top, it looks smashing in the dark, but if your looking for a good experience with simulation games, I would personally suggest looking at other options.
