B000OCXFCO|5.0|Washington is Next! stands as my favorite Megadeth song ever. UA is a super strong album. there are hints of riffs and music from prior excellent Megadeth songs, but these stand on their own too. the hints are nice tying this out as Megadeth, weaving it into the chronology and efforts Dave has established. Some great \\"Dave-isms\\" too in the lyrics. Solid rocking CD, my only songs I'm not really into are Burnt Ice and the rereleased A Toute Le Monde. The Roadrunner extra \\"Black Swan\\" is a good track too.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I waited awhile before writing this review because it takes time to really ingest the masterpiece that is Fear of a Blank Planet. I can see similarities musically to Sky Moves Sideways,which I own,and of course moments that may remind one of In Absentia, which I consider to also be a masterful creation. Quite simply put,this is the result of hard work,dedication,and talent. Although I found the subject matter of this particular Steven Wilson tale to be a little less visceral and involved than some of the previous efforts,but than again I also found myself riveted to the lyrics as the music carried me along on a path not beaten since my early days of vegging to old Floyd albums. Yes,this is a concept album in every sense of the word,complete with a 17 minute epic that is really several fine works amalgamated into one continuous and flawless epic. The musical soundscapes are all at once beautifully lush,wonderfully ambient and have the effect of being extremely heavy without becoming oppressive or weighty. The production is as always flawless,and Steven Wilson has again surrounded himself with key players replete with astounding musical proficiency. There is even a cameo from Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson that while resplendent,is still somewhat understated given the vast talents of this man. All in all I must say that if you are indeed a fan of Porcupine Tree or even if you just jumped on the bandwagon after say,Stupid Dream,you cannot go wrong with this wonderfully created musical journey into the realm of teenage angst and quiet rebellion. The biggest crime is that one will never hear music this good on commercial radio...ever.
B0002KVULG|5.0|This is one of the sexiest draculas I've seen. I hated when all of a sudden, vampires have to turn all weird looking before they bite.  Some cheeziness; it is a 70s movie afterall. But it is quite enjoyable.
B000Q9IZ5C|1.0|First, let me say that I love Serenity. What I don't like is how they recycled the original DVD and added so-called \\"extras\\" in this version and are charging full-price for it. The \\"extras\\" are not worth it - as you watch them, you'll notice they use the same footage over and over again. The case is nice, but they really want to suck your wallet empty by inserting a sales flier listing \\"official Serenity\\" merchandise you can order - that's all this version is about - bleeding you dry. I was very disappointed in that I was expecting to see alot of unreleased/raw footage and this was not the case. What a shame - a blown opportunity to provide fans with a truly memorable collection - the only memorable thing about this version is the lack of material and the full price.
075640407X|5.0|If you want to know what the book is about, read the editorial reviews above. They'll do a better job anyway. What I will say is this - For all those who are heaping high praise on Rothfuss and this, his debut novel, (Roth...where have you been all my life?) it is as deserved as praise can get. For me, I can only say thank you. Plain and simple. Thank you Patrick Rothfuss!     I read a ton. And I read a ton of everything...but fantasy is where my heart lies. I didn't know my heart was in glittering shambles until I read 'Name of the Wind' and found it beating again within these glorious pages. Readers such as I come across authors like this..what, once a decade maybe? Thank God I found him. Thank God I paid attention to those annoying little Amazon email notifications telling me 'here is a book we think you'll like'. I hate being predictable to the analytics of a computer. But I didn't just like this book, I flat out adored it. So much that I wish Quothe and his world really existed. Much like I felt the first time I read Watership Down, devoured every season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, or wept when they prematurely cancelled Firefly. Now I have until well into 2008 to read the next Chapter in the Story of Quothe. Bring it on Rothfuss. I'm good at waiting for things of greatness.
B000TGJ8IU|1.0|Tell me something: were there really a group of hardcore die-hards of \\"Troy\\", somewhere in the world, asking Wolfgang Peterson and/or Warner Bros. for a definite edition of this lukewarm toga-fest?  I don't know, maybe it's just me, but even rabid Brad Pitt fans don't seem to really care about this flick - not that it's really a bad film per say. It's just... irrelevant. The best scene in the movie, hands down, is that fight between Pitt and Eric Bana; everything else has been DONE TO DEATH in MUCH BETTER pictures.  So the idea of another 2-disc edition completely puzzle me... or not - let's face: execs at Warner Bros. would sell out their own mothers to make a buck!

B000QQFKYE|5.0|Lynch's latest exploration of the dreams and nightmares of Hollywood focuses on the actress, Nicky Grace, (superbly played by Laura Dern) who has just got a role in the remake of an Eastern European film based on a Polish folk tale. At a read through of the script the director reveals that the original production was believed to be cursed and that the lead was murdered during production.    Nicky Grace becomes increasingly distressed by the ill omens that surround the production; then, in a disorientating moment of cinema, she says to her co-star, \\"Something's happened\\" and the film collapses in on itself leaving her to inhabit different times, films and characters  as she stumbles through INLAND EMPIRE trying to make sense of her reality. Films and reality merge and entwine; and just as a coherent thread arrives it collapses back in on itself  as if the viewer is watching a pattern on a kaleidoscope - unable to capture the ever changing narrative.    INLAND EMPIRE feels like a summation of many of Lynch's themes and echoes of his previous works can be found scattered throughout Nicky Grace's nightmarish journey.  This is a film about films within a film - a fractured nightmare where the protagonist wakes to find herself in another celluloid nightmare.  It delights, teases and frustrates and could not be described as an easy 3 hours viewing.  It is, however, a stunning, claustrophobic and brilliant film that is unlikely to win Lynch any new converts but will surely satisfy his many fans
B00005U8EM|4.0|I THOUGHT THAT THIS MOVIE WAS VERY FUNNY BUT ALSO NERVE WRACKING. I WOULD HATE TO WAKE UP TO \\"I'VE GOT YOU BABE\\" EVERY MORNING, IT WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY.

B00003CXCD|3.0|My wife and I recently visited Italy, including several days in Rome.  We thought watching this old movie (and Three Coins in a Fountain reviewed elsewhere) would be a pleasant way to relive some of the visit.  My mother-in-law watched with us.  Of the three of us, I was the only one who wanted to watch the whole movie (but I am a die-hard fan of old movies, generally of a different sort).  It has not aged well.  We were disapponted in the sparsity of scenes of Rome, that being our main reason for watching it.  The story line was implausable in the 1950s and more so today, but the acting was okay, the storyline sufficient to keep my attention (if not that of my wife or mother-in-law) and I've always enjoyed Gregory Peck and Audrie Hepburn.    I remember being dragged to this movie as a young boy by my mother who could not get anyone else in the family to go with her. I was too young to protest successfully.  Now that I am in my 60s, I think my earlier reluctance was not misplaced. However, it is harmless and pleasant enough in its own way and has an 1950s mildly uplifting theme.  I can imagine a more modern treatment of this theme (princess wants to escape her life in the eye of the media and royal obligations and experience the common life for a while, then has to make a choice between \\"true love\\" and family/state obligations), but I doubt I would want to watch that either.
0861714911|5.0|I bought this based on the previous customer comments, and I was not disappointed. This is a very nice, compact, volume. Topical organization and introductory sections are very helpful to me as a newcomer to Buddhism. Heavy repetitions have been omitted, making the suttas very easy to read without compromising the integrity of the message. I highly recommend this volume to new practitioners or students of Buddhism.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|We saw the movie \\"Once\\" and loved the music, so we bought this CD.  It is very mellow and really good.  I'm not sure you would enjoy it without first seeing the movie, but it is certainly worth it!
B00006674X|2.0|Rarely has there been as odd a coupling in the history of cinema as the one on exhibit here - Elvis Presley and Mary Tyler Moore - two more polar opposite personas could not have shared the screen in 1969 when this movie was released. In what turned out to be his last dramatic role, Presley looks fit as he was then riding the momentum from his legendary [[ASIN:B00025L42Q '68 Comeback Special]], while Moore - looking very Mary Richards-like, at least in Season One - was floundering in cheap Universal movies (like this one) after her salad days as Laura Petrie on [[ASIN:B0007WFY4S Dick Van Dyke's classic sitcom]] and still a year away from her own [[ASIN:B00005JLIC epochal TV series]]. Yet, Presley obviously felt the seasoned Moore (versus his standard gallery of vacuous starlets) would give him credibility as a more serious actor in a film that dealt with social issues albeit in a most unbelievable manner.<br /><br />Directed in journeyman TV-movie fashion by William A. Graham, the contrived story concerns three nuns, undercover as nurses in civilian clothing, who are sent on a mission to an inner city neighborhood to help the groovy Dr. John Carpenter, who runs a free clinic there when he's not singing and playing his guitar. Complications ensue as each sister finds it difficult to assimilate themselves into the community no thanks to a belligerent local pastor against their mission from the outset. The giggly Sister Barbara attempts to confront the local grocer to change his price-gouging ways, while the sullen Sister Irene feels conflicted about being a black woman amid the racial inequity of the real world. Sister Michelle, however, has the most palpable dilemma - should she remain faithful to the church or succumb to the charms of the doctor? If any of this could be taken seriously, there might have been a chance toward a grittier examination of social services to the marginalized. In an effort to stay topical, there is a discomfiting rape scene and an oversimplified treatment for autism called Rage Reduction.<br /><br />But all this effort is secondary since this is Elvis after all, and he has no facility as an actor to play anyone but himself. With his aggressive sideburns and skintight white jeans with matching shoes, he does not slip into any character that would be credibly living in the ghetto. However, he does sing four songs, of which only \\"Rubberneckin'\\" is worthy of a second listen. As Sister Michelle, Moore is overly earnest without her trademark irony - the Mary we love only shows up briefly during a touch football scene in the park. Singer Barbara McNair, deglamorized and barely cracking her famous smile, plays Sister Irene, while future soap opera villainess Jane Elliot plays Sister Barbara. Look for Ed Asner playing a progressive cop but sadly no scenes with Moore are offered. The only noteworthy extra on the 2002 DVD is the original theatrical trailer.

B000N6TX22|3.0|Amazing how two films about babies that I've seen in the past couple of days (this and Knocked Up) can make me feel so differently about the world. For starters, Knocked Up made me feel depressed about relationships in general. Children of Men ultimately makes me feel like getting on a roof top and shooting all the zombies.<br /><br />Wrong film.<br /><br />Children of Men ultimately makes me feel like getting on a roof top, with a megaphone, and telling everyone to throw away their pill, their condoms, etc. If every woman in the world is going to end up infertile, then lets get procreating now!<br /><br />Hahahahaha.<br /><br />OK, a bit OTT, but what a harrowing film this is to watch. It's all about the world in 2027 (twenty years away) when no child has been born in 18 years, as all women are infertile, and the world's youngest human is murdered. Clive Owen (I know!) is sought out by an ex girlfriend (played by Julianne Moore) to help protect a pregnant girl.<br /><br />It's set in a very dark and depressing England, filled with guns, violence and lots of not very nice things. The film did grip me from beginning to end, purely because of how shocking it is, despite the fact I hate Clive Owen's acting with a passion. It's a infinitely shocking movie, which will leave you depressed, full of no passion for life anymore - yeah, I do let myself get too affected by movies sometimes. Give me a couple of days. The best thing to do after watching this movie, is to get into bed with the person you love and stay there. Hehe.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I watched the movie and ordered the soundtrack immediately afterwards.  'Once' is called a musical, not because the story is told by the music, but because the music IS the story.  The music, and thus the story, is simple, honest, and never devoid of emotion.  Watch the movie, buy the soundtrack, and you will not be dissappointed.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|i was recently watching a program about young tv stars and where they are now and looking at all the people that were in my socalled life they all still look pretty young, they could make another series if they wanted to.  i loved this so much i wish they would even if it was half as good as the original series it would still be amazing
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I am a big fan of the books, and this is a very faithful adaptation.  Owing to the unique story and nature of the Dexter books (can't wait for Sep. 18!), this series basically spreads the first book out over the first season, rather than serializing the books like most TV series try to do.  It really works here.<br /><br />A note of caution.  If you haven't read the books, this series like the books contains very graphic content.  After coaxing my Wife into watching episode 1 with me, I have had to continue watching on my own.  If you are squeamish about blood, and about amputation in particular, STAY AWAY!

1594489505|5.0|I really did not want to read a book about war and women's suffering. Who can be bothered when there are beaches to be visited, and  air conditioned cars to drive in America. My mother's nagging got to me and I picked it up on vacation. The prose left me breathless. I felt every splintered piece of wood, felt the suffocating air and cried every tear with Lilah and Miriam. Now I am suffering through withdrawals, I am not ready to let them go. The best tribute is that when I hear news of Afghanistan on the television, I suffer because Lilah and Tariq might be suffering; then I remember again that they are not real people. They feel like family to me now and I care about every street and neighbor in Kabul. Will we ever know how a male author got right up under the skin of of female characters and made them so very real in excruciating detail? Now my mission is to nag everyone around me to read this book. If you want a world class lesson in writing, pick up this astonishing book. Bravo Author! By your brilliant craft you have illuminated a nation.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|I was buying this Collector's Edition mostly for the additional features, including a commentary track with more than half of the main actors from Serenity, and some neat featurettes.  However, I was struck by how impressive the packaging was.  It's got this cover which swings open like a book. And the cover art reflects what the show is about much, much better than the original edition.     The movie, it really goes without saying, is wonderful. If you've not seen Serenity, this is the edition to buy.  The special features were pretty good, especially the commentary track.    The other cool thing is that the Session 416 viral marketing videos were included in this edition. Although they were filmed to be grainy, black-and-white images, there is a surprising amount of additional detail you can see on them on your TV rather than your computer screen. It really adds something to these mini-movies to see some subtleties of acting that weren't visible before.     I was a touch dissapointed with some of the other features, if only because they were a bit repetetive.  Some of the footage was used in more than one of the features, especially the feature that ran on the Sci-Fi Channel.  It was spliced together with other, new, footage, and some of the re-worked footage was from a different perspective (like one of the outtakes, for example), but I was hoping to see a bit more new material.     All in all, though, a significant improvement in extra features over the original DVD release. Hard core fans, or people who don't have a copy of Serenity yet, will want to get this.  And if you're the type who is holding out for a sequel, like I am, it's also worthwhile to pick up.

B000PMGS8G|4.0|I was looking for this movie since five years ago. The movie itself is a piece of work for any scifi fan.  However, I thought that the advances in DVD technology could add a better experience... but I was wrong.  I was expecting to see my home theater trembling as the bass and drums from the main theme started.  Unfortunately, there is no difference in listening the movie with a powerful home theater or with the speakers of your TV.      Another thing that disappointed me was the included postal.  Although it could be a masterpiece for its unknown creator artist, I think it will remain well kept in the box.  By the way, the case has a nice design.    If you want to see this movie, just the way you remember it in the theaters I recommend you to buy it, however don't expect too much of the special features included on the DVD.
0783226845|4.0|Look, Al Pacino is over the top and chews up every scene like a doberman with my slippers, but it doesn't matter.  SCENT OF A WOMAN is a grand vehicle for Pacino's antics; the story has meat on its bones, and the ending will leave you pumping your fist.<br /><br />As Army Lt. Col. (retired) Frank Slade, Pacino plays one ticked off hombre.  Mad at the world (due to being completely blind), Col. Slade is ready to call it quits. . .but first, he wants one last fling--over Thanksgiving Weekend, of all weekends--in the Big Apple.  Yet he needs a pair of eyes:  He finds them in young, peach-fuzzed Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), an earnest student attending a New England prep school in the business of preparing its young skulls full of mush for entrance to Harvard.  Charlie has a few problems of his own, the biggest one being he's on the hot seat because he knows who the culprits of a mean-spirited prank are--but he's not wheeling to squeal on his classmates.<br /><br />So the Colonel and his young companion have spellbinding adventures in New York, culminating in a dramatic confrontation as Charlie tries to thwart the Colonel's date with a .45.  Meanwhile, there is a camaraderie--a rapport--that develops between the two characters; Charlie's naivete, his gleaming innocence, affects the curmudgeonly Colonel.  It overpowers, even changes him. . .so much so that Slade comes to Charlie's aid at his school's disciplinary hearing, where the retired Colonel gives a rousing speech, and subsequent dressdown, to the institution's snobbish dean (James Rebhorn).  The entire scene is one hundred and fifty percent riveting.<br /><br />Heck, SCENT OF A WOMAN in its totality is riveting--despite Pacino's constant rants and pity parties, which grow tiresome.  On the other hand, his portrayal of a blind man is utterly and completely convincing. You'll also notice a very young Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays a preppie classmate of Charlie's.  Hoffman went on to say this role launched his career; and SCENT OF A WOMAN ain't a bad way to do that.<br />--D.

0143057693|4.0|I strongly encourage you to listen to the unabridged CD narrated by Scott Brick instead of reading this book.  Brick has a wonderful way with voices and accents that give the story depth and suspense you won't find on the printed page.<br /><br />The book opens in the closing days of the Second World War in East Prussia as a shadowy Austrian escorts a renowned Hungarian scientist away from the advancing Soviets.  The Austrian turns out to be a member of the resistance who wants the scientist's knowledge to remain secret from governments that might use that knowledge to create super weapons.  This part of the story is as vivid as any great World War II spy novel I've read.<br /><br />Moving to the present, an enormous container ship finds itself facing unprecedented large waves.  How will it survive?

Others get the same idea ahead of Austin.  Can he arrive in time to save her?  What other surprises await him?<br /><br />As an interlude, you'll also experience a most unusual Civil War reenactment.<br /><br />Starting the book with so many interesting incidents sets a high expectation for what's to come.

0618680004|1.0|Dawkins certainly has a knack for drawing attention to the bizarre, particularly in the religious arena.   But as for the arguments themselves?  Christianity must be defined by Jesus Christ, not by anyone who chooses to adopt the name \\"Christian\\".      Anyone who reads the New Testament can see that its teaching in no way supports the bizarre examples adduced by Dawkins, such as the Crusades, bombing abortion clinics, or persecuting people with homosexual tendencies.  And the idea that atheistic morality is superior to New Testament morality is obviously false. Even in my extreme antiChristian days, I could see that. Where do the ideals of liberal humanism come from?  Apart from sexual ethics, from the New Testament itself.      It is ironic that the key chapter of the entire book, \\"Why there almost certainly is no God\\", is probably the weakest of all; this is chapter 4, of which Dawkins himself wrote: \\"This chapter has contained the central argument of my book\\" (Dawkins' p.187).  If you doubt the weakness of Dawkins' arguments here, just try copying out all the key paragraphs of this chapter by hand word-for-word, as I did, and you will see what I mean!    Dawkins explores the issues of God's existence via the idea of the Ultimate Boeing 747.  The idea is that a Being as complex as God can have come about only at the end of a long process of evolutionary development.  The punch line is: \\"Who designed God?\\"  However, this argument assumes a number of things.  It already assumes the truth of \\"evolution\\" by natural selection.  It assumes that \\"evolution\\" must necessarily result in increasing complexity as it goes on.  It assumes that it must necessarily produce improved or \\"optimized\\" entities.  It assumes that nothing can exist in and of itself without origin, which is an argument by analogy from what we see around us.    But, clearly, a person who accepts the existence of a single Creator God would not believe in God if He were not conceived as unique to start with.The concept of God assumes certain things about God: that He is infinite, eternal, omnipresent, and so on.  People may wish to dispute these, but the fact remains that God is assumed to be Creator.  If He is not, then He is not worthy of worship - not really even worth bothering with.    So the conclusion of Dawkins' logic is already built into its premise.  Because he has already programmed his assumptions into the point from which the argument proceeds, it is inevitable that the conclusion reached will be one that he favours.  As Dawkins himself would say: \\"Garbage in, Garbage out\\" (p.133).  Obviously Dawkins is perfectly entitled not to believe in God's existence - that's up to him.  But it is less than honest to pretend that he has succeeded in arguing logically for the extreme improbability of God's existence.    Dawkins has tried to equate the ID (Irreducible Complexity) argument with `the God of the gaps'.  But how could there be a gradual transition between walking on all fours and walking upright?  The instability of the socket in transitional forms would make this impossible.  But here, Dawkins has virtually admitted that his \\"consciousness\\" has been \\"raised\\" to such an extent that he is willing to put his faith in the process: \\"There's got to be a series of advantages all the way ... .  If you can't think of one, then that's your problem, not natural selection's problem.  Natural selection - well, I suppose that is a sort of matter of faith on my part since the theory is so coherent and so powerful.\\" (Dawkins interviewed by Jonathan Miller, in: *The Final Hour* (BBC2, 14/11/2005).)    Again Dawkins wants to argue that the \\"anthropic principle\\" [AP] makes the need for a Creator redundant.  One can almost imagine his foot stamping as he argues that design and AP are incompatible: \\"They are *alternatives*\\" (p.164)!  It is as if Dawkins were saying: You better believe it because I am a scientist and I'm telling you!  So, wishing to remain Darwin-sounding, he opts for the controversial \\"multiverse theory\\" - and if you don't believe him, it's because you haven't had your \\"consciousness raised\\" by Darwin.  In the light of Dawkins' support for the strong anthropic principle, it is interesting to read Roger Penrose's comment (from 1989): \\"the strong anthropic principle has a somewhat dubious character, and it tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts\\" (The Emperor's New Mind, p.561)    Dawkins also seems to assume that Natural Selection is identical with Evolution.  Natural Selection is something which can be tested scientifically as it is a process.  Evolution, on the other hand, is merely an accepted paradigm, which requires, for example, that human beings and apes must have shared a common ancestor.  Natural Selection occurs through the same mechanisms found when people interbreed different types of dogs or cats.  This is how Darwin discovered the idea, even without a knowledge of genetics.  The information has to be there in the DNA for Natural Selection to work.  Natural Selection does not generate the kind of new genetic material which Evolution requires.    In reality, Dawkins assumes something as a fact, and then tries to use as a proof the very point that he is trying to establish.  We all know that theists do this, but at least they are honest about what they are doing.  But Dawkins claims that he holds the logical high ground.      In my view, the best critique of Dawkins' book is David Robertson's \\"The Dawkins Letters\\" which consists of the author's own letters posted on the Dawkins website. The author replies to Dawkins' chapter-by-chapter and has a knack of getting to the nub of the issue each time.  This seems to me easily the most thorough critique of \\"The God Delusion\\" currently available in book-form.

0345494997|3.0|This book is not likely to change your life but it is a great subject.  People like Mamah end up footnotes to bigger personalities so I think the author was clever to pick this character for the subject of a book.    Mamah struggles throughout the book and she does not come to any resolution by the end of the story.  The author portrays her as intelligent but the Mamah in the book likes to be lost and irresolute.  As a feminist this character is ineffectual and at the mercy of the men and choices in her life.  Mamah takes on the characteristics of a martyr and is a lot like the female characters of the fiction of her time period (early 1900s).    This book is definitely fiction and one person's portrayal of a historical character.  The FLW facts are sprinkled into the text awkwardly.  Frank Lloyd Wright is two dimensional but that may be a good idea considering his following.    If you are a feminist or a scholar of Frank Lloyd Wright you will probably not enjoy this book.
0393061310|5.0|I was mildly amazed by some of the other reviews this book got. For instance a one-star-reviewer points out that america was just as fertile as europe hence it was clearly the native americans low IQ that explains why they didn't become as advanced as the europeans. The reviewer clearly didn't read the book correctly. The land may have been just as good but it lacked the plants avalible for demestication. North america also didn't have any of the large mammels for raising. please note that these are all geological problems that the natives had to face and has nothing to do with the race of people like some readers would like to think.    In short ignore the biased reviews written, this is an great book that is very logical and easy to understand. The book may not be entirly origional but it is the first book to fully support the ideas with proof and put them in an easy to understand way. This book will change the way any open minded person thinks. I highly reccomend it.
B000MVQIEO|4.0|This was a great show that really highlighted the 90's.  It was something kids could watch and get a feeling that someone else knew what was going on.  Yes, there was an over abundance of $50 words and the characters were sometimes painfully unaware, but overall, the show was usually right on the money.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I've been a Crue fan since Too Fast For Love and I've always had a soft spot for Nikki.  All I can say is.......WOW!  I have owned this CD for a week now and can't get the songs out of my head - I'm still blown away!!  There's such range of emotions that you feel when listing to this.  The powerful lyrics draw you into Nikki's journey and James Michael is, without a doubt, the best choice to bring the lyrics to life.  Needless to say, I am eagerly awaiting the release of the book!  I wish Nikki, James & D.J. much deserved success and thank them for creating this masterpiece!  You guys rock!
1416523359|4.0|I enjoyed Lisey's Story, but like to many others, I tend to miss the old Stephen King.  Lisey's Story didn't really take me in until mid-way when I started enjoying the story a bit more.  I found the relationship between Lisey and Scott touching and ultimately sad when Lisey finally lets go and says goodbye.  My problem with the book is the wordiness and  length of it. I never thought we'd get to BOOL ~~ the end.  I do love Stephen King, though and feel he can still spin a good yarn, just not like the old days.  All in all, Lisey's story is a good one.
1416523359|2.0|First I want to say that I have been an avid Stephen King fan for over 20 years.  But I believe this departure (amongst others) from the \\"voice\\" I can readily identify as Mr. King, is quite easily explained.  That explanation is simply the supposition that it is his wife's \\"voice\\" that I am digesting and not that of the venerable Mr. King    Tabitha King's talents as a writer (which are quite admirable in their own right) have been firmly overshadowed by that of her husbands since he was first published.  When anything that has Stephen King's name on it is an instant Best Seller why wouldn't they (as a couple) collaborate?  It is a way for Tabitha to earn great sums of money as a writer, albeit an unsung, uncredited one.    There are quite a few examples of this distinct change of \\"voice\\" in King's other works over the last decade or so.  Those of you have followed his work closely know this to be true.  IMHO this kind of misdirection is right up Mr. King's alley, isn't it Richard Bachman?
0345440900|5.0|This book has been great for us and I believe this is largely because we read it before the baby was born and started implementing Hogg's techniques immediately.  Having read both Sears/AP and Ezzo parenting books as well, we have found Hogg's methods to be a great middle ground.  The EASY method is working great for us.  I love her chapter on Awake activities and appropriate playing at different ages and stages.  She breaks down bathing and massage techniques, as well.  Her advice on using a pacifier makes so much sense.  And, of course, the easy to follow charts that allow you interpret and respond to your baby's cries and movements are excellent.    Best of all though is the confidence we have in putting our baby down to sleep - because we started this from day one we were able to implement Hogg's techniques that allow us to put the baby in her crib while sleepy but still awake and watch her gently drift off to sleep on her own.  Our baby has been learning how to self sooth since day one and it's amazing to watch her.
B000P5FH3K|5.0|I absolutly love to watch movies in their intended format.  Movies that are viewed the way they were shown at theaters, in WIDESCREEN(WS).  It makes me cringe when someone talks about the differences between WS and fullscreen(FS) and doesn't even add one of the two main differences.  That being when watching in FS, you are loosing around a third of the movie.  The third comprising of the far left and right sides of the movie.  I'll be honest, when watching a great movie in FS, one that envelops your senses, you won't be thinking about WS, but you should!  With prices dropping on DVD's all the time, why would one want to buy a partial movie, when for the same price, you can get the whole \\"experiance\\"?  And with prices also dropping on TV's, especially DLP's, the average household will own at least a 42\\" screen before to long.  When watching a WS movie on a 42\\" screen, you are almost doubling to tripling your viewing pleasure compared to that of a 27\\" screen.  This of course depends on the aspect ration and if the movie is Anamorphic, 16:9, enhanced for widescreen tv's.  Got a phobia with the black bars, I understand.  But, I guarantee, buy at least a 56\\"screen, add at least a 5.1 sound system(also dropping in price), and when watching a great WS movie with any kind of black bars, at night, you won't know they're there!  One more thing.  Think more than a 42\\" is too much for your living room.  Take this test.  Face and stand right up to the front of at least a 56\\" screen.  Walk backwards till you're comfortable with watching the screen.  Now, walking back up to the screen, count how many steps it takes to get back.  You'll be suprised at how close you really are comfortable watching that larger screen.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|Another fantastic season of Lost!  The best show on TV pretty much just keeps getting better.  Although the third season arguably starts out a little weak, it really picks up in the second half (exactly like season 2 did...) and finishes with a bang.    So much is learned about the 'Others' in season 3, and Michael Emerson steals the show as Benjamin Linus, the best character on the show.  Tons of mystery, surprises, action, drama, heartache, humour, etc.  Pick this up as soon as you can... but watch first 2 seasons first.

B000067IZ3|2.0|I am not going to take the time to tell you what this was about.  Basically because I have no clue myself.  This movie was so freaking hard to follow.  It was SO long.  I guess I understand.  The guy finally realized his family was more important than his job and drugs can have an effect on even the most unsuspecting families and pepole.  But holy man make it like and hour and a half amd save me the time.  Perhaps if I watch this again it will make more sense to me.  This was a good movie I think.  They just made it hard to follow.  Going from one story to another.  Over and over.  Give it a try I guess.
B000006YXV|3.0|Let's begin by acknowledging that Marvin Gaye was one of THE most important singing artists/stylists of the 1960s/70s and early 1980s. From 1962 to the time of his tragic death in April 1984 he had 60 R&B singles hits, most of which also scored on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 for Motown's Tamla subsidiary.<br /><br />Following his death, three more would make the R&B charts, including My Last Chance, released in 1990 on Motown. He was also inducted into the R&R Hall of Fame in 1987, and in 1996 was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.<br /><br />So, in putting together a 22-selection CD under the title \\"The Very Best Of\\" the producers certainly had a wealth of material to choose from among his hit records. So what do they do? Include six tracks [4, 7, 11, 14, 20, and 22] that were not hits or even the B-sides of hits, and one [track 16] which was the flip of a hit - 1960's Keep On Lovin' Me Honey with Tammi Terrell [# 11 R&B/# 24 pop]. Which they do NOT include, by the way. Nor do they provide liner notes or discography of the contents.<br /><br />Here's a man with a background that could fill several books and they can't find someone to give us a few pages of information. For example, it might have been of interest to some to know that, on both Good Lovin' Ain't Easy To Come By and The Onion Song the female vocalist was actually Valerie Simpson, as Tammi was too ill at the time to complete the sessions [although she is credited on the records]. That also applied to the late 1969 hit What You Gave Me, also not included here.<br /><br />I like Marvin Gaye's music as much as the next person, but some people are obviously way too easy to please. Companies like Motown, MCA, BMG, etc., have to learn that the buying public demands a bigger bang for their buck these days, especially when something is hailed as \\"The Very Best Of\\" or \\"The Greatest Hits Of.\\"<br /><br />Quality outfits like Ace Records of London, Rhino, Var&egrave;se-Sarabande, Eric, and Bear of Germany know this and go out of their way to provide us with detail-filled liner notes and, for the most part, the singles that made these people stars in the first place.this and go out of their way to provide us with detail-filled liner notes and, for the most part, the singles that made these people stars in the first place.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Gus Van Sant's follow-up to his unneccessary remake of Sir Alfred  Hitchcock's classic thriller \\"Psycho\\" is an inspiring film on the levels of \\"The Karate Kid\\" and his Academy Award winning 1997 drama \\"Good Will Hunting.\\" The star power here is terrific, with Academy Award winners Sir Sean Connery (Best Supporting Actor, \\"The Untouchables\\"; but he will always be remembered as that suave superspy Bond...James Bond), F. Murray Abraham (Best Actor, \\"Amadeus\\") and Anna Paquin (Best Supporting Actress,<br />\\"The Piano\\"). To give away the multi-layerd plot would be pointless, but the relationship between Brown & Ms. Paquin's characters should have been developed further (no, I'm not asking for sex scenes, but touches of romance would have been nice). Watch for a surprise cameo near the end. Though I haven't seen it, \\"Finding Forrester\\" is good like \\"Good Will Hunting\\" minus the language and sex.  Rated PG-13 for some strong language.
B000002QWD|5.0|This compilation, in one form or another, has been a best-seller each Christmas season since 1945 as, first a 78 rpm Decca album featuring the smiling face of Bing on a light blue cover (photo shown here), and containing five records: Silent Night, Holy Night b/w Adeste Fideles; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen b/w Faith Of Our Fathers; White Christmas b/w I'll Be Home For Christmas; Let's Start The New Year Right b/w Danny Boy; and Jingle Bells b/w Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town. On all but the last (which was done with The Andrews Sisters and Vic Schoen's orchestra) the backing was by John Scott Trotter & His Orchestra with Max Terr's Mixed Chorus on the first two and The Ken Darby Singers on the third.<br /><br />It was an annual # 1 seller from 1945 to 1949, including the change in 1947 when it was reduced to a 4-record set with the elimination of Danny Boy/Let's Start The New Year Right, and a new, virtually exact, re-recording of White Christmas, brought about by the master tape of the original being worn down by constant use in creating millions of single records. That new version is the one heard on almost all single releases and compilations since then, although the original has lately also been digitally restored and released (e.g., the CD The Very Best Of Bing Crosby Christmas).<br /><br />In 1950 it first came out as a 10\\" 33 1/3 rpm album with the same eight tracks as the 1947 release, as well as a 45 rpm 4-record set, still using the original cover design. That changed in 1951 when the cover became red and featured a new picture of Bing. In 1957 the picture was changed again, this time featuring Bing wearing the Santa hat, and 4 selections were added: It's Beginning To Look Like Christmas (recorded in 1951); Silver Bells (with Carol Richards and recorded in 1950); Christmas In Killarney; and Mele Kalikimaka (with The Andrews Sisters) - the last two recorded in the late 1940s.<br /><br />Since then the album has remained unchanged with regard to content, although you might see it with the banner \\"White Christmas\\" - like this issue - or simply \\"Merry Christmas\\" with the only other difference being a slightly different order of listing of the same 12 selections.<br /><br />Very soon you'll see this at practically every check-out counter. If you don't already own a copy pick one up and keep the tradition alive. Christmas simply isn't Christmas without the mellow voice of Bing Crosby somewhere in the background.ith the banner \\"White Christmas\\" - like this issue - or simply \\"Merry Christmas\\" with the only other difference being a slightly different order of listing of the same 12 selections.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Keira Knightley is one of the most beautiful women of this generation, as well as a terrific actress (\\"STAR WARS Episode I,\\" the wildly successful<br />\\"Pirates Of The Caribbean\\" films) and is a natural choice for the role of Elizabeth Bennet in what seems to be the 200th film version of Jane Austen's classic romantic comedy. Sir Laurence Olivier, Greer Garson, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle have starred in wonderful adaptations of this novel. I highly recommend those versions, though they may seem old and dated to the uneducated rabble. Trust me, they are so worth it.<br /><br />The all-star cast is simply amazing.<br /><br />My only complaint is the casting of Donald Sutherland. His American accent was distracting, as the story is set in England, during the 19th century, and all the other actors had British accents. Fortunately, his screen time is limited.
B000005KQT|5.0|Marion Walter Jacobs (b. May 1, 1930 in Alexandria, Louisiana), and influenced by the likes of Sonny Boy Williamson (No. 1) and Louis Jordan and his jump saxophone arrangements, quite simply revolutionized the blues harmonica technique when he showed up at Chicago's famed Maxwell Street market in 1947.<br /><br />Among the hundreds of artists plying their trade in that environment he stood out to the point where he attracted the interest of the small Chicago labels Ora Nelle and Regal where he cut several sides. His big break came in 1951 when the Chess brothers, Leonard and Phil, hired him to back Muddy Waters and Jimmy Rogers, and it was as much his amplified harmonica that made hits out of Mannish Boy, I'm Ready, and Standing Around Crying [by Waters), and That's All Right and The World Is In A Tangle (Rogers).<br /><br />By 1952 he was assigned to the Checker subsidiary, and by that September he literally burst into prominence when the instrumental Juke streaked to # 1 R&B and remained there for eight solid weeks [the flip was Can't Hold On Much Longer and is erroneously listed in this compilation as \\"Can't Hold Out ...\\"). This single was billed to Little Walter and His Night Cats.<br /><br />The follow-up Sad Hours (instrumental) didn't quite repeat that success, settling for # 2 early in 1953, while the vocal flipside, Mean Old World, reached # 6 as by Little Walter and His Night Caps. Fittingly, Muddy Waters played guitar on each of these first three hits.<br /><br />When his next hit reached the charts later that spring (Off The Wall, # 8 as an instrumental, and Tell Me Mama, # 10 as a vocal, he was billed as Little Walter and His Jukes in order to capitalize on his debut smash hit. The Jukes consisted of Chess sessionmen Louis and David Myers on guitar and Fred Belows on drums.<br /><br />From there to 1959 he would add 10 more hit singles to his credit, his last coming in 1959 when Everything Gonna Be Alright (erroneously listed as \\"Everything's\\") reached # 25 (his lowest charter) as simply by Little Walter. These included the seminal My Babe, written by Willie Dixon and based upon the old spiritual This Train, which became his only other # 1 hit, staying at that position for five weeks early in 1955.<br /><br />It would have been nice if, in putting this tribute together, producer Andy McKaie had found room for the three hits omitted - Oh Baby which made it to # 8 in May 1954 b/w Rocker, You'd Better Watch Yourself which reached the same position that September b/w Blue Light, and Who, which reached # 7 in April 1956 b/w It Ain't Right. You can find You'd Better Watch Yourself on The Best Of Little Walter from MCA/Chess, also listed by Amazon.<br /><br />Adding to this CD's worth are the six pages of liner notes written by the noted music historian Billy Altman, which includes a wonderful story behind Juke, several nice photographs, and a complete discography of the contents. To quote from Mr. Altman \\"By 1968 he was gone, leaving behind a legacy that harmonica players everywhere regard as, quite simply, the holy grail.\\" That much was recognized by the Blues Hall Of Fame in 1982 when they inducted him among the 20 honoured in their first year of existence. You'd think those pompous ciphers at the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame would wake up and at least recognize him in their Early Influence category.<br /><br />Just a superb collection.ittle Walter.

1591396190|2.0|I can't understand the reason behing all the good ratings and hype. Perhaps it's because the catchy name and the human relentless search for new fashions and trends. It's also interesting to notice that the book was written by two professors who lack the real world experience and challenge of running a company. They use past success stories that match their theory while neglecting the others. The concept of differentiation through quality or cost was presented several years ago by Michael Porter, and the Quality Function Deployment and Kano Models are excellent tools for describing the customer value.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|Let me just start by saying i have never liked movies about being stranded on an island. Blue Lagoon, Castaway etc etc, i avoid those movies like the plague, why? Lets just say growing up in Chicago i have become used to urban enviroments and movies in general with a lot of stuff going on. How much can possibly go on when stranded on an island, fish? Swim away from sharks? Building a fire? Don't get me wrong, i like character development as much as the next person (never seen a lord of the flies movie but i read the book and did enjoy it, but thats the only stranded scenario i have ever gotten into) but i just couldnt buy the old grass huts and spear fishing cliche over and over again.       So what made me start watching Lost, i hate to say that into the third season i saw a commerical with Evangeline Lily in it and thought to myself, a show with a girl that fine in it has to be at least decent, if anything maybe i could catch some rainy scenes with her in it. So i downloaded the season premiere of season 3, a tale of 2 cities. When i saw the airplane going down after the others (didnt know at the time) came out of their houses i was just blowned away. For one, i thought it was just about a deserted island, instead i get people walking out a neigborhood that looks like surburbia in any ol city. So i thought to myself after watching the episode only one thing.....\\"I have to get the first 2 seasons Now\\".           Now after being completely won over by the cast of lost for 2 seasons i jumped right back where i left off, the second episode of the 3rd season. Now i heard many reviews about how weak the first 6 episodes are. While it was nothing compared to the second half of the season, it was just basically giving a little insight into who the others really were. The whole dynamic between Jack and Julia is particularly fascinating, simply because Jack never truly falls for Julia like he has fallen for Kate, Julia however falls head over heels for Jack. The fact that they shared the most important bond (getting off the island) drew them closer together.            I enjoyed the episode when Ben shows jack the footage of the world series with Boston winning and the Look on Jack's face is probably the most stunning/revealing Look on the entire run of the show, You feel Jack's Pain that he can't get home but he realizes the world is still going on and it fuels him to do whatever is neccesary. The season picks up like a runaway train with the return of Lost that came on at 10:00pm est.  Now, Lost is one of the only shows that can get away with coming on so late..10o'clock at night on the east coast, i am usually in bed by 9:30 and you want me to stay awake till 11:00pm. But you know what...i did it anyway, they could show this show at 3:00am and i would set my alarm  clock to watch this outstanding show.  Honestly, in my humble opinion their was not one weak episode in the whole season, even the episode \\"expose\\" which people seem to loathe for some reason i found enjoyable, sure not as much as others but the ending alone made a chill just go up my spine.           Lost is like crack to me, if i miss an episode i am downloading it the next day just so i can watch it, i am addicted and i will be addicted until my friends get off that darn island, and when they do, thats when i'll be in tears because this show that has brought me so much entertainment will finally be over.....thank goodness for dvd's.
B00005JPLW|4.0|First off I want to say that I enjoyed this movie very much and I was completely entertained, and that's why I go to the movies after all, is to be entertained.  And yes, \\"300\\" is visually stunning, however, I felt like I was watching a CGI video game. Granted the remarks made by so many reviewers here hailing the film as \\"art comes to life\\" as the screen images are totally CGI generated to perfection, is aptly put, but the CGI sets, scenery, and even characters give the film too much of an artificial feel.  I believe that many of the critics that bashed this film did so due to the fact that the \\"artsy\\" look of the film takes away from the human realism of the movie's characters.  It's as though computer generated characters could have played all of the parts of the film and you would still have the same end results- \\"art comes to life.\\"  The \\"hunchback\\" Spartan that wanted to walk in his Father's shoes and die for his King is completely computer generated, but he still puts in a stellar performance!  The Persian War-God , King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) that has the height of a true giant, and the hands the size of a car's hubcaps is totally awesome. But I kept asking myself each time he appeared in the movie, is this guy real or CGI?  I also couldn't help but wonder if the perfect psychics of the Spartan Warriors were completely the men themselves or if they had some CGI assistance with those perfect tans and abs?  There are aspects of the story itself that are somewhat doubtful, such as the beginning where Leonidas is being raised as a \\"true Spartan\\" warrior, who is taught to have no feelings, no mercy, and no compassion.  A child taught these things would not grow up into adulthood as a Great King or even a person that anyone would want to be around.  This type of content is not something you would want your young kids to be subjected to, especially in today's society. Even though the content is staying true to the graphic novel.  However, this film is not about today's society or the modern world in which we live.  And young kids shouldn't be seeing an \\"R\\" rated movie in the first place. This movie is about Ancient Greece and the society in which these people lived and how they had to fight to keep their civilization, as well as their lives.  The film achieves it's goal by catching it's audience's attention from the very beginning and holding it to the very end.<br /><br />These are just a few feelings that I had concerning the movie, and is why many of us write \\"reviews\\" in the first place.

B0006GQMC8|4.0|I really liked this movie. The story was very good and well acted and the action was good. Normally I do not watch Bronson movies but I saw this one as a kid and it allways stuck with me.
B000MO80P6|5.0|When the first film in the epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, \\"The Two Towers.\\" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?<br /><br />Fortunately moviegoers only had to wait a year for the answer, when \\"The Two Towers\\" debuted in December 2002. The second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, but it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen.<br /><br />The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" and the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth. It's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.<br /><br />This film is much darker than the first movie, although we still get some funny moments from Gollum and the hobbits, but some creepy ones as well. Gollum/Smeagol's argument with himself is absolutely chilling. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments (\\"Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!\\" Pippin wails when a \\"tree\\" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam.<br /><br />And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.<br /><br />Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust, which is warping our dear hobbit out of his own mind. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.<br /><br />But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play \\"Gandalf 2.0,\\" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman.<br /><br />As with the first film, it's worth spending a little extra to see the extended version -- loads of behind-the-scenes material, and lots of scenes seamlessly pasted back in. Yeah, some of them are battle scenes, but we also have more exposition on Eowyn, backstory on the troubled Faramir and his late brother, and Merry and Pippin spending time with the Ents... and experiencing some personal growth. Literally.<br /><br />The journey continues in \\"The Two Towers,\\" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from \\"middle chapter syndrome.\\" An amazing continuation.m \\"middle chapter syndrome.\\" An amazing continuation.
1416523359|3.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King's since I found my Dad's copy of the The Stand when I was a kid. I have read all of his novels and all of his collected short stories, but I have stopped buying them in hardcover because they just aren't worth it anymore. The last few books have been so self-derivative and so self-referential. Lisey's Story is essentially Rose Madder + Misery + Delores Claiborne with a little bit of Cujo thrown in (the latter 3 being books I very much enjoyed and were each strikingly original.)    I read Lisey's Story in one big marathon read on a 3 leg trip home from Berlin. I enjoyed it ok and it was a fine way to spend the time, but I miss the originality of his earlier works, and I remain convinced that his true strength is in writing short stories, not novels (not anymore anyways.)
B000PMGNK4|5.0|I have always been a fan of Ghost in a shell since the very first movie. Solid State Society is an awesome movie, I think one of the best so far. The writing is good, follows the series very well. I loved the music. And if you get the limited edition version you get the sound track on CD, and an extras DVD, plus the main movie DVD. If you are a fan of the series this is a must have. I keep watching it over and over.<br /><br />This is not a movie for young childern. It is violent, dramatic, and fast paced.<br /><br />I think all anime fans would like it. As a fan I personally recomened it!
0761145613|5.0|This is a wonderful calendar for the busy family, especially if your kids are into sports, gymnastics, etc... Think of all the practices, games, meetings, etc!  At a glance you can see where everyone needs to be. I've used Ms. Boynton's calendar for so long that I cannot imagine life without it! I especially like the 16 month version of this calendar. It goes from September to December of the next year!! This allows you to pencil in appointments and social events without waiting for a new calendar!<br />I also use the extra space beside the numbers to write other things as needed--it's very resourceful.
0783228007|2.0|UPDATE for the BLu Ray, this is a beautiful rendition, but again it is missing the additional scenes, contrary to what some had said (and prompted me to purchase this addition!!)  Now I have two copies of the same missing scenes movie.  Would be nice if they would finally make this whole!!!
B000002J03|5.0|I've been a Classic Rock Music Fan all my life.  When I was just 13 years old and joined the Columbia Record Club (Remember the old 12 Albums for just a penny!) my first dozen choices were a nice variety of good 'ol classic rock: Aerosmith, Boston, Yes, and of course, Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin usually makes a top ten appearence on any Definitive Rock Album list.  Led Zep IV and Houses of the Holy are both equally popular.<br />But, I have to say, Led Zeppelin II is THE Definitive Led Zeppelin album and My Personal Favorite.  If you don't think so, just look at the facts.  Led Zeppelin music has never waned in popularity.  They are as strong today in record sells as they have ever been, second only to the Beatles probably.  They are still heard on All Classic Rock Radio stations across this country everyday!<br /><br />If for some unknown reason, you are Not familiar with the mighty Led Zeppelin, and you want to get acquainted with their music, this is an excellant place to start. This is an authentic 5-Star album, and I hope my review pushes it up on Amazon's scale.<br /><br />Highly Recommended
B000QQFKYE|3.0|Remember that scene in 'Amadeus' when Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) criticizes Mozart's (Thomas Hulce) music, saying it had \\"too many notes\\"?  Well, 'INLAND EMPIRE' may have just two tones (dark and cryptic), but it has too much of everything else.  Too many characters, too many plots within plots, and too many seemingly arbitrary scenes that last anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes.      Like 'Mulholland Dr.,' 'INLAND EMPIRE's' immediate predecessor in both time and spirit, a certain method pokes through the madness from time to time. But unlike that previous masterpiece, there's simply TOO MUCH madness for the viewer to slog through in order to get to the heart of the mystery.  Not that Lynch's mysteries have ever had \\"hearts\\" in this sense, but they've always had a discernable thread running through them that only the most careful viewer can pick out.  And even though the nature of that thread varies depending on who you ask, it's always been there, even in his (previously) most difficult full-length film, 'Eraserhead.'        In 'INLAND EMPIRE,' the thread is only faintly present, but halfway through this 3 and a half hour film it's buried beneath all the 'notes,' and it doesn't seem eager to be discovered.      Now that I seem to have fully trashed it, I feel that I must say that it's not a BAD movie, nor is it necessarily subpar even by Lynch's historically high standards.  If anything, it demands more repeat viewings than any other film he's done before; in addition, it boasts what just might be Laura Dern's best performance ever, which is saying something.  But, like all of Lynch's work, there will always be loose ends that just don't fit, and I have a feeling that this will go down as the most notorious example of this phenomenon in Lynch's catalogue.
1594489505|5.0|I thought \\"The Kite Runner\\" was one of the best books I have read in years and I have to say that \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" was THE best book I have read in years.  I highly recommend both books to everyone.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|I'm not quite ready to join in dismissing this version of the best selling novel Cold Mountain as a \\"big-budget chick flick\\" but I will say that I'm one of the few women I know who wasn't captivated by this movie. (Not many men I've talked to about it liked it, and mostly said that was because it needed more Civil War battle scenes, which I agree it did.) What was good about Cold Mountain was its visuals, which were often very nice. What was wrong with Cold Mountain had to do with its slow moving plot, and the intolerable extent of its departure from realism. The morality here was cartoon-ish and straightforward good versus evil, no line of gray between, and its love story was the fluff of razor-thin romance novels. I also thought the characters were broadly-drawn stereotypes who somehow exuded shallowness (that mortal sin of the fiction world) despite the many over the top moments they were all given. Dyed in the wool fans of the actors who make up the cast of Cold Mountain will probably always enjoy this film, and it's great that they do, but for the rest of us, I'd advise that expectations be kept low. Cold Mountain is all right, but not much more.
B000002WMH|5.0|This is the definitive early Elvis recordings collection to own as well as begin one's journey when understanding where the roots of rock and roll began and forever changed the face of popular music.  It is appropriately titled, ELVIS THE KING OF ROCK AND ROLL:  THE COMPLETE 50's MASTERS.  These are master recordings that cover the years 1953-1959, and includes all of his legendary and classic hits, such as \\"Heartbreak Hotel,\\" \\"Hound Dog,\\" \\"Love Me Tender,\\" and \\"Don't Be Cruel.\\"  Once one hears the somewhat haunting opening track, \\"My Happiness,\\" a song made famous by Connie Francis, and subsequent unreleased tracks within the five CDs that have not been heard before, there is no doubt that Elvis had indeed an immaculate voice where he crossed musical genres and boundaries:  blues, country, soul, gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly; undoubtedly he said it all during a Sun recording session, \\" I don't sound like nobody.\\"<br /><br />RCA and BMG music exceptionally and lovingly compiled this box set.  Besides the five CDs, there also includes a beautifully presented souvenir book that provides a detailed chronology of Elvis's recordings, which includes his Sun and RCA records session dates as well as soundtrack sessions, catalog numbers of each US and UK album release, and most importantly, the book illustrates the excitement of Elvis mania with the display of photographs, singles, album covers, and short anecdotes and reminiscences of various sessions as noted by Peter Guralnick.<br /><br />ELVIS THE KING OF ROCK AND ROLL box set will leave one breathless.  Elvis Presley was one of a kind, and continues to be emulated by fans and new generations alike as they discover and rediscover his music.  Indeed, Elvis is still everywhere.
0743298020|5.0|I anticipated this book with the impatience of a child awaiting a birthday and the opening of a precious and long awaited-treasure. It came to me via a package from Australia with the paperback edition; the U.S. release is a few months off yet. The story drew me in from the first page and I could barely put it down but sleep finally demanded it. I wanted to read it quickly to reveal its mysteries and at the same time draw it out to make the experience last as long as possible. I finished it a day ago and still feel it vibrating through me.    The main character, Margaret Lea, immediately delighted me with her descriptions of life in her father's rare book shop where she tends old and precious books. She is asked one day, by letter, to write about the true life of the century's most important writer, Vida Winter. She is intrigued and mystified as she has never read any books by contemporary writers and doesn't consider herself a writer, safe for a small publication of an essay. She makes her way to misty Yorkshire where she begins to delve into Vida Winter's story and that of a mysterious and tragic family.    For me this book is primarily about the stories that each person has. There may be a public story, a told story and a true story, but every person has stories. And by telling us Vida and Margaret's stories and placing books so centrally within the plot, it celebrates books and the characters within them. There is a section when Margaret tells us that she takes care of the books in her fathers' shop and reads a few pages every day and as long as someone reads about the characters in them, they stay alive.    Setterfield's language is rich and evokes wonderful images. I saw misty Yorkshire moors in the November twilight that make you want to draw your scarf closer but I also felt eerily unsettled and uneasy at the descriptions of Isabelle and Charlie's interactions.    My major complaint is with the nitwit who wrote the back cover summary and I must seriously question if the person ever read the book. I am glad that I did not read it first, as I would not have purchased this book nor recommended it to my friend based on the poorly written plot teaser.
0446693804|1.0|I was VERY disappointed in reading this book.  It meandered for the entire 224 pages.  Very simplistic and a third-grader could have written a better book.    I can't believe all of the positive reviews.  People must really be hard up for a love story.  This is sophomoric at best.  When the name of the author is larger than the name of the title---WATCH OUT!!      It was a waste of my time.  He could have summed the entire book up in one paragraph.  What a pity!!  Time is so valuable and I had to waste it on this ersatz piece of \\"literature\\".
B000QQFKYE|5.0|First off I have to disagree that this film isnt meant to be understood, that its just meant to wash over you. Granted just watching it cluelessly, as almost everyone does the first time, creates a certain mood. But if you're a human being with curiosity, one simply cannot just passively let it wash over you. You want to know at least how to read the signposts in the film. One cannot expect to understand all the minutae.   Even on first viewing you can pick up on some of the larger themes. The film is about the American experience, its a 'remake' of a European film. Obviously the theme here is fairly unmistakeable. This parallel is drawn upon many times in the film.   Also one of the main themes is how Hollywood is no longer this ridiculous grinning entertainment machine like it was in the early days of Hollywood. It is now feeding the neurosis of the people consuming its drivel. The frustration in Lynch's work is evident towards the industry. He is almost screaming 'you have all this power to effect positive change in peoples life, yet look at what you're doing to your audience.'   The movie is well done, its not for the pedestrian. Its for someone willing to stop and look at the signs.    Even though I was frustrated at some points during the first viewing. I can feel it already this film has its hooks in me like every other Lynch film I've seen. The hook is what motivates understanding, I may not get it all but over time it will open up to me like a flower.
0385733577|5.0|The story just drew me in and left me gasping for more. This story pivots around twins, Sophie and Josh Newman and how they get sucked into the world of immortals and legend. Josh is working for Nick Fleming in his bookstore when the bookstore is invaded by Golems, his sister works in the coffee shop opposite.<br /><br />Because they both have seen things they shouldn't, and accidentally ripped two pages from an ancient book of power, they have to flee with Nick, who turns out to be Nicholas Flamel. They discover that some of the people out of legend are still alive, as are many of the Gods. Nicholas' wife is kidnapped and nothing will ever be normal again.<br /><br />It's interesting, fun and a wild ride. I can't wait for the next book in the series.
0761145613|5.0|For the past five years or so, this calendar has helped me orchestrate life in a family of five.  It has a column for each family member (if you have a larger family, you'll need to buy two.)  Each cell offers a 1\\" x 1/2\\" space for events or notes, so it's not big enough to serve as a hourly daytimer, but it does let me brush in the broad strokes of our family activities.  Sandra Boynton's characters are delightful and fun. I'm going to order another as soon as I complete this review!
B000002UB3|5.0|...I think I would choose to be in Abbey Road studios during the recording of this album, watching and hearing these great tracks laid down. The Beatles proved that you don't need kazillion-track recording machines and high-tech gadgets to create what is arguably the best album of all time.<br />Every song is a pure joy to listen to and as a whole, they cover an amazingly wide variety of styles. \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" by John Lennon is one of the hardest, most guitar-driven smokers out there with a riff that just cuts through the sky, and have you ever heard anyone belt out a vocal like Paul McCartney does on his R&B number \\"Oh! Darling\\"?<br /><br />George Harrison's uplifting \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" can't but help one feel optimistic even during the bleakest of moods and his \\"Something\\" is one of the most romantic songs ever written. Ringo gets a fun one in too on the almost country/western-sounding \\"Octopus' Garden\\" with some great guitar flavor from George.<br /><br />There are the sublime \\"Because\\", the hilariously macabre sing-along \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", the fascinating lyrics Lennon was so famous for on the album opener \\"Come Together\\" with that innovative groove and it all culminates with just perfectly composed back-to-back medleys that range from the most touching sentiment to funky to all-out rock 'n roll that build toward a very simple message of love.<br /><br /> There's a great book called \\"Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles\\" by Geoff Emerick and Howard Massey that describes the moment when John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison walked down into the studio and recorded that climactic guitar jam in one take, squaring off \\"like three gunslingers\\" with their guitars over their shoulders, firing away at one another.<br /><br />What I would have given to be in the studios that day...
B000OZ2CZW|3.0|I never heard of Rihanna before buying this CD. I do not go to clubs or dance at all. I would imagine I'm way outside of the target demographic that a commercial pop CD like Girl Gone Bad was produced to catch. But, probably like a lot of people, I heard the song Umbrella once and had to hear it again. Since I don't have MTV and wouldn't even know what radio station to tune in for this genre, I looked up the info on the Web, did a little reading about the artist, and eventually bought the CD. And it is quite good, even with the painfully obvious formula for pop success. Please note that by saying it's formula-pop I don't mean it's \\"bad.\\" In fact I am very impressed by the art of making this kind, or any kind, of music.     Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad is what I call club music, electronic beats and a few samples with ultra-produced vocals all run through a computer program like Pro Tools to make everything \\"perfect.\\" And guess what? It works here. The songwriters for this CD (which are many) did an excellent job of creating memorable hooks in the music, lyrics, and vocals. Like the big hit Umbrella, a lot of these songs just get stuck in your head and stay there. I can see this CD producing multiple chart-toppers, and making a boatload of money for everyone involved in making the Rihanna product a success. If even people like me (white, middle-aged, middle class male) are getting hooked on this I bet the sales are going multi-platinum many times over.    Standout tracks: Umberella, Breakin Dishes, Shut Up and Drive. I also think the songs Push Up On Me and Don't Stop the Music will be big hits if the company continues to back the promotion. Really, out of the 12 songs on the CD, I bet 9 could be on the charts if the company continues to invest in the promotion and marketing.

B0000028MA|4.0|I'd certainly recommend this album for those seeking what the review title indicates. Indeed, some of the songs included on this album are amongst the best the featured bands have recorded (especially 'Birth Ritual' by Soundgarden. That song absolutely kills!). Chris Cornell's solo track 'Seasons' is a gorgeous little acoustic number as well. And damn, the guy could sing! His stuff with Audioslave is no indication of just how-damn-fine a singer he was in his day. None better in my opinion. On the low side, however, who-the-hell put Paul Westerberg's 'Dyslexic Heart' on there? Power-pop rubbish. 'Waiting for Somebody' is better, but not by much. But over-all the album is enjoyable listening and worthy of your purchase, especially if it encourages you to check out some of the band's albums (especially 'Badmotorfinger' by Soundgarden and 'Dirt' by Alice In Chains).    Also, just one little issue, I'm sure the original release/pressing of this album featured a Led Zeppelin track performed by Heart, but subsequent releases featured another Led Zeppelin song, 'The Battle of Evermore' (from 'Zo-So') by the Lovemongers. Either the song was changed or, it's the same song but the performance credit was changed (The Lovemongers featured Anne Wilson from Heart on vocals, after all. Maybe for this reason they were credited as Heart because the label figured no-one had heard of the Lovemongers?).    Anyway, I've said enough. Buy and Enjoy. MK.

B00003CXSP|4.0|This was an unpleasant surprise - its a very good film.<br />It doesn't have the same gut level horror as Silence of the lambs, but there are nevertheless some nerve shredding moments.<br />The cast are all good and if Julianne Moore isn't quite as good as Jodie Foster, shes very close.<br />The other reason this film is a success is because of director Ridley Scott. The settings in Florence are stunning and the whole look of the film is great. Ridley Scott always had a great eye for visuals!<br />OK so the very end is a bit unlikely, but this film will keep you entertained, and holds up to repeated viewings. You should be able to pick this up cheap now, if so buy it!
B00005JPLW|5.0|For one brief moment I believed that 300 was the best movie ever made.  Then the awful truth dawned on me - 300 is actually better than that. If you were to place all 175,693 feature films made in order from the very worst at position 175,693 (which would be Shock Treatment) and the very best at position 1, then the movie 300 would be at position -1, consistent with its status as better than the best movie ever made. But 300 is also a movie that was made. The logical but shocking deduction from these facts is that 300 is actually BETTER THAN ITSELF! Through an indisputable recursive loop of truly awesome abs, 300 will also occupy all positions of the list from -2 through -infinity.  So the second best movie ever is an infinite number of places down on the list!  This is certainly madness!  But it cannot be denied!  Don't even try.    The repercussions for our culture are astounding.
B00000DGSN|5.0|This is one of the best, if not THE best live album by any 70's rock band.<br />The atmosphere on this album is electric throughout. Listen to the start of Highway Star, the band changes gear a couple of times and delivers a stunning performance - the whole place is rocking.<br />The sign of a great live album is that some of the versions on Live In Japan are better than the studio originals. One such track being the overplayed Smoke on the Water.<br />The mk II line-up of Deep Purple was fantastic. Blackmore and Lord repeatedly deliver brilliant solos, Gillan's voice is amazing and Ian Paice still remains one of the best rock drummers (playing with McCartney in the late 1990's).<br />The set has subsequently become a greatest hits album by default.<br />The 2nd CD contains 3 encore tracks which are a bit of a mixed bag. I had a far better version of Lucille on an LP many years ago, but this is a minor quibble as overall this album represents a great band at its peak.
B000PFUA9G|4.0|Brad Paisley is one of Country Music's best performers.  I always enjoy his music and look forward to hearing more.
B000TVNW50|2.0|I really wanted my money back after watching this, but what I wanted more was the 90 minutes of my life that I wasted.<br />Not much good about this movie at all: horrible script, terrible acting (even by Sean), the set was okay. And to it's credit, it was better than Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.<br />Watch at your own risk.

B000NQQ1Z4|5.0|My friend M's Birthday was the 24th and I thought no better way to<br />say Happy Birthday than with a GREAT album since my friend M's<br />a musician. This is Uriah Heeps second album and it is DARK and<br />GROOVING with the title track and such songs like Spider Woman<br />you can't go wrong with the HEEP! This version also has a whole<br />lot of extras too! So grab your wallets and say Abracadabra<br />to The Heep's Magician's Birthday it is great music. And speaking<br />of music my friend M has put together some SCARY music with<br />guitar drumming and out of this world effects. You can go to<br />people on here and type M. And he should have a website posted<br />for his music,but beware! It is not for the faint of heart!<br />Again though if you love GHOULS SPOOKS WITCHES and HAUNTS<br />than this is the music for you! HAPPY BIRTHDAY M. August 24<br />1983 was a great day or should I say SCARY day!<br />NOTE: IF M's GUITAR PLAYING IS TO INTENSE FOR YOU JUST<br />KEEP REPEATING ONLY MUSIC ONLY MUSIc ONLY MUSic ONLY MUsic<br />ONLY Music ONLY music ONLy music ONly music Only music only<br />music .... ..... .... ..... .... ..... .... ..... .... .....
B000001FN1|2.0|I don't understand what everyone sees in this album. I have listened to a lot of metal and this does absolutely nothing for me. Maybe it's the production - all the sounds are smoothed over so much that there is no punch to the guitar, or anything other than Doro Pesch's voice. All We Are is pretty good, but everything else reeks of generic 80's metal - from songs about metal (\\"Metal Tango\\") to lyrics like    I have no mercy  I tell no lies  I kiss the strangers  And then watch them die  (\\"Kiss Of Death\\")    there are a lot better 80's metal albums for your money's worth. If you are a fan of old-school metal or hair metal, and don't mind elements of the other in your music, then give it a listen. Otherwise, pick up something like Powerslave or British Steel for some good 80's metal.
0312370830|5.0|I read this book in a day...was pulled to the storyline and wanted to find out what happened to the characters.  I'm surprised that I have never heard of this event before.  If you are interested in the history of WWII (as I am), this book will engross you. It reminds a person of the depths that people can be drug down to, but it also reminds you of the heroism that ordinary people rise to to help others.  A wonderful read!
159562015X|5.0|We ordered a number of these books for our employees and I have taken the training through Gallop, to be a coach.  I find the strenght finders test to be valuable for knowing how to assign tasks and responsibilities to employees, to aid in hiring decisions, for developing and working with employees, for developing strategies, brainstorming sessions, you name it.  We all have gifts and things we do exceptionally well.  When people are given the opportunity to walk in those strengths, the results are amazing.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|This is a good version of an excellent book by Jane Austen, written almost 200 years ago.  There are several other versions on film of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  Although it did not stick to the book in some crucial places, overall it was well done.  It could have been longer and done a better job.    One part was very anoying:  Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourg, visited the Bennett family after they had retired.  Even though Lady Catherine was a snobish woman used to having her own way in life, she would not have visited Elizabeth's family that late in the evening.  Good manners would not have let her.  Her feelings of superiority would not have condoned it.  Her mention of a \\"little garden\\" at the Bennett home should not have been in the film at all as it served no purpose since her visit was at night and it was dark.    Overall, not a bad version of a book every fan and viewer of Jane Austen's movies should read.    The best version of this book-to-film was A&E's.  They had the time to make it almost perfect.  I think Jane Austen herself would have approved of it.    However, given the time available, this is still an enjoyable movie if you like Jane Austen.
B000O178BY|5.0|What a great concept album. I haven't been following NIN like I should, but just the other day I got the feeling that I HAD to buy this album, and now I know why. You see, the first order of business in this album is to illustrate our current problem and a very dark look and what this problem might become if we keep hybernating under our own political burrow. Trent Reznor facilitates our vision and takes us un an unimaginable journey of sound, breathtaking writing and the future knocking at the door. Marvelous, just plain marvelous!
B0006GAI6O|4.0|This is a good movie.  The cast is varied and each fits his or her character.  Very enjoyable with good music and ballroom dancing.  It's a \\"light\\" romantic comedy/drama but worth owning.
0143034901|4.0|This book felt like a combination of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Water for Elephants.\\"  It is beautifully written- someone mentioned the constant rain- you could feel it.  There were enough plot twists and turns throughout to keep it entertaining.  While I figured out the main twist fairly early on, there were enough little twists to keep me interested.<br /><br />I don't think this is the greatest novel ever, but it certainly was fun to read.  I didn't have a long flight or a day to dedicate to it, so it did seem like it took longer than normal to finish it.  I didn't find it hard to follow the characters, but at some points the detailed descriptions were a bit cumbersome.  I also felt a little ripped off with how the ending was told- in a letter format, rather than in present tense.  It felt a little forced; as if after 400 pages the author was trying to wrap it up.<br /><br />Definitely worth reading if you're looking for something a little different, a bit more challenging than chick-lit, and simply well-done.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|The single star is for the DVD & not the movie itself (which I would give 4 stars to ).    If the WHINEsteins intention of splitting this film in two wasnt soley for the purpose of squeezing as much $$$$ out of the DVD purchasing public as possible , I have a real simple solution for them :     Release the unrated/extended/loaded w/ extras half-versions , waitaminuteherecomesthegoodpart .........    AND....... the theatrical version .....at the SAME TIME !!!!!     Wow ! What a novel idea ! Give the fans an actual choice ! I cant believe they didnt think of such a simple solution themselves .Its not like there arent multiple version of other DVDs when they are released .    Oh and for the record , I am not boycotting , I am just patiently waiting for the DVD version of the way this film (singular) was meant to be viewed .   If you want to wave your copies of these bastardized half-films in my face , be my guest .
032147404X|5.0|I love this little book.  It's packed with lots of little details a hobbyist like me can forget very quickly.  I love the chapter with tips to take sharper photos.  There's just a number of things you can't learn without the help of an expert, so this section alone is worth a lot.  I love the way each topic has been separated, and without being too technical, it gives enough information to go out and start shooting and having fun. The only negative is that its pages are starting to fall out. The material used for the pages seems to be of good quality, but it doesn't hold together for too long. It still gets 5 stars, though.
B000RMQH30|5.0|No doubt many people will come to this album thinking about Ben's last solo album, Both Sides of the Gun.  This is all about growing up.  The Innocent Criminals are back and they truly shine on this release.  How Ben Harper only has a compact amount of avid followers compared to other great musicians, is really beyond my ability to grasp.<br /><br />Buy this album.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Since ledbetter heights i have watched and listened to KWS and seen him in concert, but not until this DVD/CD has he come of age, a real bluesman. I have listened to the \\"Thrill is gone\\" until I was tired of it, but this recording is superb, BB seems at his best. I can't recommend this DVD/CD more heartily.
B00005NB0H|4.0|Yes I am probably one of the original WHO freaks!!In my younger days I felt  that there was no wrong that this band could do.I think that TOMMY was the  first album I listened to the really blew me away.Of course then there was WHO'S NEXT.No need to go into detail about how I feel towards this album.  Then I heard the original release of LIVE AT LEEDS.I think this my be why  that even though I really enjoy the Deluxe version, there are some things  that just don't sit right with me.For example,the little \\"extra\\" guitar  riff in \\"Young Man Blues\\" just doesn't sound like it really belongs there.  It bothers me to the point that I can't enjoy listening to that version of the song.    I do however,really love the addition of the TOMMY performance.Listening to the beautiful and powerful version of the overture makes me understand  that this band had depth and feeling beyond a cursory listen.I must say though that if it were not for the addition of TOMMY,I would be satisfied  with the original eight-song disc.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|I love this CD! I have a hard time taking it out of my car. If you like music witha meaning you will love this cd. Taylor is amazingly talented as a songwriter and musician! BUY THIS CD!!!!
B000002U9Y|5.0|From reading various sources, I have heard that Syd plays on all these tracks except Saucerful. I know this isn't the common opinion, but I have heard: Syd played the discordant guitar part on the end of Let There Be Light / Remember a Day we know is Syd, although one book says Gilmour added a few guitar slides / Set the Controls is definitely Syd, he played this on stage most shows they did, but his contribution is simply the main 3 note riff. It was probably recorded in the fall '67 / Corporal Clegg is most likely the only real 5 man Floyd song. Sure sounds like Syd on wah wah. By his own admission, one source says, he does not play on this, but I don't put any faith in his memory. That's him on guitar. The really big mystery here is See Saw. This was recorded in Jan '68,  still within Syd's time. I hear an acoustic guitar and wah guitar shadowing in the mix throughout the song, and if you listen at the end of the song as it fades out, you can clearly hear a wah wah guitar, like floating away, like he's saying by-by. Listen to the lyrics of See Saw and a stretch of the imagaination, and you have Syd's authentic swan song with the Floyd. I consider See Saw the real clue on the transition. The meaning of it is a mystery, from incest to Syd's departure, the later I subscribe to. It's a underated song to boot. This LP is more Syd than is given credit for.

B000ML7CSU|5.0|I discovered this item when searching for 'glass dressing shaker no drip' on the Internet. I had never heard of Eva Solo before.  I wanted a dressing container in glass, not plastic. I wanted one I could shake easily without leaks leaving an oily coating on the outside of the container. I had tried cruets and bottles of various kinds and nothing was really satisfactory. I saw this simple elegant design and decided to give it a try. It is more expensive than others but as it had all the features I wanted, I thought it would be worth it. For all its seeming simplicity, a lot of thought was put into its design not only for its good looks, but function and durability too. Despite its delicate appearance, it is made out of tough heat and break resistant glass. The bulb-shaped bottom makes for surprisingly generous capacity, 8.5 oz, despite its apparently small size (6.5\\" tall and approx 3.25\\" in diameter). The funnel-shaped mouth of the bottle makes it easy to fill without drips and splashes. The silicone stopper forms a perfectly tight seal so that shaking the contents doesn't risk leaks or drips. The best part is the perfectly controlled dispensing. You don't ever over-pour or waste dressing leaving a large puddle at the bottom of your salad bowl. I find that I use quite a bit less per serving and the dressing lasts much longer and stays tasting fresher when stored in this cruet. Although salads are perfectly dressed, there is no dressing residue in bowls or dishes. I'm so pleased with this container, I bought another. The Eva Solo Dressing Shaker is now one of the most useful items in my kitchen. It doesn't hurt that it is elegant too, drawing interest and complements from dinner guests!
0452287588|4.0|I have read Tolle's \\"Power of Now\\" multiple times and was anxious to go further with him on his journey to bring peace to the human condition.  While I did not enjoy this book quite as much as PON, this is a great read because it continues to add color to the direction Tolle and others are treading.  This is great material but it suffers from a fundamental problem: The message cannot be completely communicated with words!  These are ideas that transcend what can be written directly. This leaves the communicators with an obvious challenge.   Tolle continues to meet this challenge eloquently in \\"New Earth\\" by pointing us in the general direction of ancient yet fundamental truths about our existence. My greatest hope is that enough of us will lock on to the direction these folks are pointing in so that we can help with the heavy lifting by simply living as the truly \\"free beings\\" as we are meant to be.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I absolutely love Linkin Park. I have loved every CD they have made, but this CD topped them all. I have listened to it more times than I have listened to most of my other CDs. Linkin Park is a completely original sound and this CD proves that more than any of the others. If you actually listen to the lyrics, you will be amazed at the depth of the songs. Great buy!
0316067598|4.0|For starters, I'd like to agree that it would have been nice if Mark Bowden was available to help write this book.  Though Luttrell's personality comes through in spades in the pages of \\"Lone Survivor,\\" it would have been nice to have a full account of this incident as seen from many different perspectives with the polished writing of Bowden.    That said, I really enjoyed the book and am saddened by the fact that there are so few men with the resolve of these SEALs who daily endanger themselves for a public that seems largely apathetic.  Its apparent that the thought of being charged with murder back in the states heavily influenced the thinking of this platoon as they voted what to do with the three goatherds they captured while looking for the enemy.  If the liberal media and our spineless politicians weren't in such a hurry to prosecute our own troops, the outcome of this entire incident would have almost certainly been different, because the vote would have been different.    Stories like this and that of the Haditha marines (3 of whom have had their charges dropped already) make it apparent that our government and population are too corrupt to defend their own defenders: the U.S. military.  Luttrell rails against the liberal press for good reason in his book, and it should serve as a wake up call to unaware civilians as to the calculus our troops must use before even defending themselves in battle today.  So sad.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Love, love, love this album.  The reason why BJ is still a huge success today is because they are not afraid to take off from the BTDT music of the 80s.  Love the title song \\"Lost Highway.\\"  It truly makes you want to roll down the windows, blast and sing loudly.  Can't wait to hear it in concert.  I will always be a slave to the oldies like Slippery When Wet and New Jersey but the new stuff is really awesome too just like JBJ is himself.  My god...the man ages well.  He looks better today than 20 years ago.  I LOVED LOVED LOVED the big hair days but I love his hair as much today as I did then.  Rock on Bon Jovi.

B000002KDO|4.0|With \\"Master of Reality\\", Black sabbath's third effort, we find ourselves smack in the middle of Sabbath Country and the landscape is dotted with their trademark crosses. This is pure Sabbath in their heyday with Ozzy sitting comfortably at the throne. The heaviness of the music certainly does not subside and songs such as \\"Sweet Leaf\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", and \\"Lord of This World\\" certainly prove that point. But we also get treated with songs such as \\"After Forever\\", with its almost happy go lucky driving beat and the Zeppelin-esque riffs of \\"Into the Void\\". A must for every Sabbath fan, my only complaint is that I thought this release was short one or two songs.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|WE ENJOYED HIS CD'S BUT WHEN WE SAW HIS    DVD OF GREAT PERFORMANCES WE THOUGHT IT    IT WAS GREAT. HE HAS A GREAT VOCAL SKILL,    ALWAYS ON PITCH AND A GREAT RANGE OF VOICE.    I HAVE SUNG ORATORIO AND SANG ON TOUR    WITH THE JAROFF DON COSSACKS WHO SING    ACAPPELLA AND VOCAL PITCH IS ESSENTIAL.    THE ORCHESTRAL ARRANGMENTS FOR THIS DVD WERE    SUPERB!

B000HXE12S|5.0|In a genre torn between elitists and innovators that so often alienate each other, \\"Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice\\" is an immense breath of fresh air that unites the two. This is underground and minimalist enough to appease the traditional fans, yet it's also creative and unique enough to make you re-think what potential black metal really can have. Deathspell Omega carries a message of theistic Satanism that is marvelously translated into their music as well as their lyrics. Their subject matter is among the most intelligent in black metal, writing in a philosophical manner that uses, twists and perverts Christianity in a brilliantly ironic way. Their music is also very fitting and complementary to their message, sounding as if it is being played \\"through\\" them as vessels for an unseen force. You have never heard anything like this before, I am quite certain.    This album is truly a strange birthing for Deathspell Omega, because if you have heard their previous 2002 release, there was nothing too special about it that might remotely indicate that this monstrosity would soon follow. \\"Si Monumentum\\" employs dissonance in ways that are utterly dark and still so beautiful and mysterious. There is a great degree of variety as well, balancing out between blasting ferocious mayhem and slower-paced mesmerizing riffs that give tremendous depth to this material. Perhaps the highlight of this album is \\"Carnal Malefactor\\", the 11-minute epic that builds up in sickening, tormented style, briefly releases the tension for a few minutes of eerie chanting and then resumes it's decimating form once more.     In brutal truth, any description of this album will fall quite short of the actual impact gained from listening to it yourself. I feel it is also best absorbed as a whole, and not as individual tracks, so I recommend giving yourself ample time to experience \\"Si Monumentum\\" without interruption. If you have any appreciation for dark extreme metal, it will be well worth it.
B000R34V50|5.0|I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT ANIMATION FOR YOUNG TEENAGERS ALSO ADULT FANS  FANTASTIC FILM NO REGRETS FOR BUYING THIS FILM WAS FANTASTIC I REALLY ENJOYED IT LOTS FUN AND JAM PACKED WITH ACTION...WOULD GIVE THIS FILM 5 STARS
0345494997|3.0|I ordered the book because of some positive reviews. I'm not altogether sure the book was deserving.     It's slow going initially, then picks up. The middle drags, then the ending is welcome, if not a surprise.     If you t=like this type of novel you may be better off checking out Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. [[ASIN:038533348X Cat's Cradle]]
B00005JPLW|3.0|If you like gore and impossible feats of combat.  This movie is for YOU!because there is no real plot and the story is pretty bad.  Except for the single combats, it was laughable.  Like the hunchback that was not allowed to fight with the Spartans because he could not hold his shield high enough to work in the Phlanx.  But there was NO PHLANX!  Heck I'd would have wanted him there to fight.  He looked pretty tough to me!    The action was great though and there were some nice boob shots.  It was like watching a graphic comic book.  Which is what it was supposed to be like and it did it very well.    While I can't recommend it to anyone looking for substance in a movie, I can recommend it for a someone looking for mindless, gratuitous violence and a good laugh.  Xercese (spelling?) was a seven foot tall piercer in a coddpiece with an electronic voice!  Very funny!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I gotta give them my props for this one. They manage to make a two-hour double-album seem, for the most part, ludicrously entertaining. I might even go as far as calling it their best record. It's a toss-up between this and Californication. I mean, it's a bit too long - four or five songs could've been taken off (\\"Charlie\\" is dumb other than the chorus; \\"C'mon Girl\\" is one of the most boring things I've ever heard; \\"Hard to Concentrate\\" is hard to concentrate on; \\"Make You Feel Better\\" seems like a cut-rate Californication track; \\"We Believe\\" is just way over-the-top), but there are two piles of excellent songs here. In pile #1, we've got the funk-rock stuff: \\"Dani California\\", the leadoff single, has great lyrics, sweet beats, booty-shakin' bass line, and John Frusciante doing cool stuff with his guitar. This is also one of the four songs to participate in my four-way mud wrestling match to the death. The prize? The award of best song on the album! \\"Hump de Bump\\" is as cool as its title suggests; the chorus owns (\\"Hump de bump you gotta hump de bump your body...\\"), and Flea shines on both bass and trumpet! The lyrics aren't much: like so much of their work, it's about making out, but the music is so solid it also one of the four Texas Cage Match to the knockout... for BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM! On \\"Especially in Michigan\\" and \\"Storm in a Teacup\\", they put the Beastie Boys to shame as far as funk-rock-rap goes; \\"Readymade\\" and \\"So Much I\\" have cooooool guitar solos.<br />Now, for the ballad pile. I think \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\" would come out first in my frequently aforementioned four-way monster truck rally to the totaling of your car; that guitar-riff near the beginning is just beautiful; the introspective lyrics are wonderful; the chorus is one of their best; and I love the coda! And the video! Anthony Kiedis proves that he is the coolest guy on Earth not named Flea (who has more tattoos than should be legal), and Flea himself jumps on the bass drum! Sweet! The title song is also pretty catchy, with arguably the best melody on the album. And \\"Slow Cheetah\\" earns a place in the four-way gun battle to the nosebleed as well. It's a total dark horse, but I really love how the song builds on itself. And the fake ending - I like fake endings. Especially since the fake ending is a sparkling, neo-Hendrixian guitar solo. I'm all for one of those. Actually, I'm all for as many of those as I can hear. \\"Hey\\" has some of the group's most mature lyrics to date. \\"Desecration Smile\\"; \\"Tell Me Baby\\"; and \\"She Looks to Me\\" bridge both genres, and the first and last are fantastic; I only really like the second because of the refrain - as usual. Hey, they know how to stick lasting hooks in their songs. I'm not gonna complain! I like hooks. Just as long as creativity isn't sacrificed for them. And \\"Death of a Martian\\" sure does mix creativity with hooks: bizarrely arranged, with a weird voice-over part, but really catchy.<br />And then there are several tracks which are good, though not fantastic: if you can get over the slight \\"ew\\" factor of \\"She's Only 18\\" (it's a bunch of middle-aged men singing about gettin' down with an 18-year-old), or the fact that it's a lot like \\"Hey 19\\", you'll find it's good; if you can recover from its insipid lyrics, you'll find \\"Torture Me\\" is rewarding; if you can get over the fact that it repeats the same guitar lick for a minute, you'll probably like \\"Turn it Again\\", and \\"If\\" is so cute I have to give it credit. So yeah. Cool album, this one. Maybe not their best. But it easily could be. I'm glad I bought this one, and it took me way too long to pick it up - I bought it about 10 months after it came out.<br /> This is off-subject, but I have reason to believe that a user has been digging through my reviews and randomly voting them \\"not helpful\\". Whoever you are, I invite you to drop a comment on this review explaining yourself. Perhaps we can reach an agreement. If this isn't the case, and I'm just being paranoid, whatever.

B0007XT87G|5.0|It's been a long time since an album has impressed me like this.  The musicanship on this is top notch. Everytime I listen to it I hear something new.  Gavin Harrison (the drummer)is very impressive.  It's not exactly an album to put on at a party, but rather to put on some headphones and take a musical trip.  The album is hard when it needs to be an not afraid to get soft without losing it's edge.  It's one of those albums that gets better everytime you listen to it. I was first introduced to this band through their latest album FOABP and thought it couldn't get better.  It did. This is my first review and I think this album is a rare five. I highly recommend this.
0374105235|4.0|Ismael Beah's story is compelling, hopeful, and vivid, yet his book, well-written as it is, felt a bit flat to me. I appreciated the clarity of his prose style and the fast pace of his narrative, but there was not enough mystery, not enough engagement with the dark forces at work in Sierra Leone for the narrative to haunt me for long. I have the greatest respect for Mr. Beah, and he seems to have real promise as a writer and international citizen, but my own taste is for the grittier work of someone like Chris Abani. Readers interested in learning about the experience of child soldiers or the horrors of Sierra Leone in the Charles Taylor era are well advised to pick up this account, though, which will fill out some of the impressions gathered from reading drier histories, more violent movies, or the purposely warped account that one encounters in novels like The Darling.
B000M53GM2|4.0|This movie is worth the price of admission just for the tank chase alone.  Not your usual Bond movie as the females aren't evil supermodels and true a woman who crushes her prey to death with her thighs is a little campy but other than that this is one of the better takes on Ian Flemmings 007 character.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|Okay, everyone knows that \\"Star Wars\\" was a seminal motion picture.  It was the biggest thing in 1977, it has influenced countless movies and tv shows that have come after...Heck, in the early 2000's (don't ask me which year, I forget...look it up!) it was voted the #1 movie of all time by Empire Magazine.  (Of course, it's a populist poll, I don't necessarily agree with it, but I see where they were coming from.)    But are we talking about some revamped version from 1997?  Or the new add-on's from 2004?    No, we're talking about the original, from 1977.    I'm getting more and more amused by people on here that call the people loving the orginal \\"reactionaries\\" (or something less, if they don't know that term) because we're against the way Lucas keeps messing with the movie.  They act as if we're idiots, falling for wanting to keep the movie the same as it was.    Excuse me?  Who's falling for what?    If the movie had never been tampered with, if Lucas had always kept the original the way it was, chances are you guys still would be in love with it!  That movie has never to this day been outclassed or outmoded.    You guys are the ones falling for all the new stuff.  There was never any need for ANY of it.    \\"Star Wars\\" made history, and invented a whole new way of looking at movies.  It's a wonderful movie, and it was a ground-breaking movie.    Every time Lucas messes with it again, he takes away some of that history.  After all, mess with it enough, and it will be hard to understand how it was ground-breaking in the first place.    Leave it as it was, and you can see how other movies tried to live up to its promise.  Continue to update it, and no movies from the 80's or 90's will even seem to come close.    And, as I said, it was (and is!) wonderful, as it was back then.    We're not the ones that are suckers for old stuff.    You guys are getting suckered into new stuff.    (Of course, I'm commenting on the original movie itself, not this particular transfer...which, from other comments on here, would seem to be pretty shoddy.  And come on, George...would you really have us believe that the original elements are gone to a movie as important as this?)

0374105235|5.0|A Long Way Gone is a different kind of war story in that it tells not of the war heroes of older generations but conveys the more important and immediate message of the arming of children in Africa. I chose to read this novel when looking for a summer reading book for my high school. I had always heard about the arming of child soldiers in Africa, a topic receiving more attention in the media these days, but I never knew much more. I was curious to learn more about this practice from the view of someone who had experienced it and believed that the personal accounts of Ishmael Beah would give me the insight I was looking for.   However, I soon found that Ishmael Beah's purpose in writing this story was much more than to tell of his childhood as a soldier. Beah intended his personal memoir to serve as a message to society of the brutality that children involved in this conflict have to undergo. Beah conveys this message using his personal story as a twelve year old boy who is separated from his family when the rebel army attacks his village. He describes to us how he was robbed of his childhood at such a young age when he was forced to flee from the rebels and survive on his own wandering a land that had become unrecognizable due to violence, risking his life to remain out of the conflict and out of the rebel's hands. However, Beah was not able to remain out of the conflict for long and at the age of thirteen was picked up by the government army and forced to fight. His war stories as a soldier show how innocent, kind hearted children as young as seven years old are brainwashed and forced to do terrible acts. Beah illustrates the hell children in the war endure as they lose loved ones and are forced into a brutal \\"kill or be killed\\" mentality. Beah also explains to us how those who are lucky enough to survive the war or be rescued from it, as he was by the UNICEF, will never be the same afterwards as they will be scarred for life by the fighting.    Beah is extremelyeffective in his purpose of conveying the message of the severity of the condition of child soldiers in Africa. His life experience establishes him as an expert on this issue. He has seen first hand the consequences of exploiting children as soldiers in war through himself, his brother, and his friends. He illustrates that this is a situation that can no longer be ignored and that action must be taken to stop this practice. Moreover, I enjoyed the story because the author was able to put the reader in touch with the reality of the problem through the personal experience of a soldier, a point of view that is very different from that of the media. It is a more personal point of view by which you get to know those affected by the war more closely. Finally, I enjoyed the story because as a young reader I felt that I was able to relate to the young author. I could imagine how horrible it must be to be robbed of your own childhood and to be forced to act like a man at the age of twelve, an age at which the major problems of most children in our society do not even compare with those of Ishmael Beah and the children he describes.

B000UX6THK|5.0|From CBS Home Entertainment's own website:      Co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost and a large number of the cast and crew have returned to participate in this extraordinary new collection.    \\"Finally the pilot is together with the series. The picture looks clean with good color correction. The sound is really good,\\" said David Lynch. \\"I think this is a great definitive Twin Peaks Gold Set - the Gold represents the highest quality. A lot of work has gone in to this, and in my opinion it has really paid off.\\"    \\"Working closely with David Lynch, I believe we've put together the ultimate Twin Peaks DVD box set with the most unique, interesting and comprehensive collection of content possible that will more than excite the ardent fan and engage new ones,\\" commented Ken Ross, Executive Vice President and General Manager, CBS Home Entertainment. \\"And we drank some damn good cups of coffee along the way.'\\"    This 10-disc set includes \\"Greetings from Twin Peaks\\" collectable postcards and a plethora of special features, including hours of newly-minted bonus content, featuring exclusive cast and crew interviews and rare footage never before released on DVD, produced by award-winning DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika (\\"Alien Quadrilogy,\\" \\"Spider-Man 2: Special Edition,\\" \\"Blade Runner: The Final Cut.\\")    \\"Secrets from Another Place: Creating Twin Peaks\\" is a collection of four new documentaries exploring the origins, production and impact of the show. The cast and crew, including co-creator Mark Frost, composer Angelo Badalamenti, singer Julee Cruise, actors Kyle MacLachlan, Joan Chen, Piper Laurie, Ray Wise, Sheryl Lee, Kenneth Welsh, Maedchen Amick, Miguel Ferrer and many others share their memories of creating the show in this in-depth piece covering the sensational and tumultuous evolution of TWIN PEAKS in four parts: \\"Northwest Passage: Creating the Pilot,\\" \\"Freshly Squeezed: Creating Season One,\\" \\"Where We're From: Creating the Music\\" and \\"Into the Night: Creating Season Two.\\"    Co-creator and four-time Academy Award(R) nominee David Lynch, Kyle MacLachlan and Maedchen Amick take an amusing look back at the series in \\"A Slice of Lynch,\\" an all-new get-together of friends over piping hot coffee and sweet cherry pie.    \\"Return to Twin Peaks\\" follows a group of devoted fans to the 2006 Twin Peaks Festival, where the show's faithful have been regularly gathering for costume contests, celebrity sightings, trivia games and other wildness in the woods outside of Seattle. And an Interactive Map allows viewers to revisit the show's unforgettable locations as they appear today...and how to find them in real life.    Thought to have been lost forever, a selection of deleted scenes has been unearthed for this collection and approved by David Lynch, offering viewers additional clues and background on some of their favorite characters and locations in the series.    The collection showcases the phenomenon that was TWIN PEAKS with such archival nuggets as the \\"Saturday Night Live\\" opening monologue and \\"Twin Peaks\\" sketch featuring Kyle MacLachlan, the \\"Falling\\" music video featuring Julee Cruise, the Richard Beymer behind-the-scenes photo gallery, original network promo spots and many more rare gems!    Newly remastered from the original negative and personally approved by David Lynch, the episodes have never looked better. Moreover, viewers will have the option of enjoying the episodes in either new 5.1 Surround Sound or the original 2.0 network television audio.     ------  So, um...there you go. Now grab a cup of coffee and a slice of cherry pie and order this baby!

It was well written and my heart went out to Mr. Frey. But...then I learned that it was not all true.  Part of it was fabricated and exaggerated. I really felt let down and disappointed.  Mr. Frey should have been honest from the beginning. I give it a 5 star rating but as a fictional story, not a nonfictional documentary.
080701429X|5.0|People have considered this book primarily a book about survival in inhuman conditions.  But Victor Frankl got into those inhuman conditions because he did a decent, human thing; he honored his aged father and mother, instead of accepting the US immigration visa.  He had a opportunity to participate in an escape attempt, but was moved with compassion by one of the sick prisoners in his care.    Viktor Frankl considered his logotherapy to be basically humanistic, attempting to focus the patient's attention on the meanings he will fulfill in the future, the things he will create, the deeds he will do, the people he loves, the sufferings he will courageously endure.  But a lot of logotherapists didn't have the God of Viktor Frankl inside them, the God who delivered Viktor from his narrow prison.    Given that we have had other impositions of inhuman conditions since the book was written, such as the Killing Fields of Cambodia and the massacres in Rwanda, it would be useful for future editions to address these situations.  Neither the foreword nor the afterword addressed these.

0316010669|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the book \\"Blink\\" by Malcolm Gladwell. It is an easy read yet very profound.  I said to myself \\"wow! How many times have I known in an instant that I was right about something but because it was inconvenient at the time to acknowledge it, I disregarded what I knew\\". In the end my initial hunch was correct!     I really enjoyed the chapter \\"Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind reading\\". It was about the NYPD's encounter with Amadou Diallo but it really hit home the concept of \\"the judgments we make and the impressions we form of other people\\". In the case of Amadou Diallo the policemen's \\"mind reading\\" was way off base. Many times people rely on past experiences to dictate how they should act NOW and ignore the   information right in front of them. Simply put, they were not present.     A book I really enjoyed about being present is Ariel & Shya Kanes, [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]]. One powerful chapter in the book was \\"You are not the story of your life\\". It reminded me of all the times that my expectations of how something should turn out caused it to turn out exactly as I had expected, as if it were a self-fulfilling prophecy. I realized it was my unconscious expectations that determined the outcome of something, rather than seeing what was truly in front of me and making the appropriate choices. I highly recommend both of these books.
B000RJO578|4.0|If you enjoyed [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]], you're going to feel an irresistible pull toward HOT FUZZ. Done in similar fashion and with familiar names, Hot Fuzz is an action flick that loves to take jabs at those cop and western films we so loved growing up with. Everything from [[ASIN:6304698682 Pale Rider]] (an old Clint Eastwood film) to [[ASIN:B00004STUL Bad Boys]] is referenced in some fashion, and they will most likely tickle your funny bone.<br /><br />Instead of deadbeat zombies, though, this time we've got a sleepy little town with a deadly secret. Feeling very [[ASIN:B0002W4UDE STEPFORD WIFE]]-ish, a highly successful police officer named Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is forced out of his undefeated duties as London cop-extraordinaire and into the dull and mundane town of Sandford. Partnered with the chubby and inept Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), Officer Angel learns to slow down but not before discovering a few strange things about his new town. They've won, every year for some time now, an award for being the best town in England. Not much to argue with there. But Nick Angel soon sees death lurking here and there (and when I say death, I mean scythe and all!) Townsfolk are cut down and the local constabulary simply wave them off as accidents. But to Nick these are NOT plain old mishaps.<br /><br />A conspiracy theory soon engulfs Nick's solo investigation and we find our lone hero riding a pale horse into town while loaded for bear (queue whistling Eastwood soundtrack here). The big question, though, is can he trust his lame partner, Danny, to back him.<br /><br />Battles and bloodshed fill the screen as Nick finds himself at odds with everyone in Sandford. From blowing away the clergy to drop-kicking an octogenarian in the face, Nick has his arms, legs and other appendages busy keeping himself alive as much as solving these supposed murders.<br /><br />There are a ton of great lines in the film, showing that writer/actor Simon Pegg has some significant screenwriting abilities (one of my favorite lines was after Nick and Danny watched Bad Boys and Nick said, \\"Well, I wouldn't argue that it wasn't a no holds barred, adrenaline fueled thrill ride. But there is no way you can perpetrate that amount of carnage and mayhem and not incur a considerable amount of paperwork.\\" And I enjoyed Danny's, \\"By the power of Greyskull!\\" moments, too.)<br /><br />Making parodies of previously serious or scary films seems to be Pegg's and Frost's forte.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|You've got to hand it to Joss Whedon. The Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator has taken his much beloved, and all too shortly lived, series Firefly and made it into something truly special on the big screen.  Serenity, like Firefly before it, is everything that science fiction should be and then some: loaded with ideas and a sense of wonder and awe.  And because it's from the mind of Joss Whedon, you can expect Serenity to be everything something from Whedon should be: smart, loaded with snappy dialogue, intricately plotted, and full of memorable characters.  Picking up where the series left off, Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and the crew of Serenity are soon on the run from the Alliance who are after the mysteriously deranged River (Summer Glau) because of what she knows.  And what she knows can, and will, change everything.  Everyone from the series is back, including Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Morena Baccarin, and the rest; as they all soon find themselves in over their heads.  The only downside of Serenity is that for a briskly paced film that's two full hours long, it's over all too quickly; but it ends with the hope that there's more in store for the crew of Serenity in the future (even though there have been reports from Whedon himself that no sequel or follow-ups have been planned at this time).  This new Collector's Edition DVD doesn't include the boat load of special features that one may think it might, but it offers some substancial material that die hard fans of the series and film will eat up regardless.  All in all, Serenity is an excellent film and one of the finest moments of sci-fi to appear in quite some time, and yes, it's so much better than anything lately to come out of a universe from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

0345440900|3.0|I did get some vital information on putting my kiddo to sleep. But her advice drove me insane when I tried to apply it to a new born! He was just too young at 1 week to perform under her requirements and I felt like a terrible mother with an abnormal kiddo. Now that he is older (2 1/2) months much of what she writes about independence and getting your kiddo to sleep is helpful. When my son was 1-4 weeks his schedule was *his* schedule and I really just had to be there for him. I still co-sleep even though Hogg advises against it and I still like to put my kiddo to sleep in my arms. He sleeps in noisy rooms and quiet ones. The list goes on. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING A WELL READ NEW PARENT CAN TAKE FROM THIS REVIEW IS THIS: read all you can even Hogg's book but always keep your instincts when it comes to raising your baby, no author is you and no one person can know your baby on a personal and visceral level the way you do. On the breastfeeding....I think her tips on the actual act of breast feeding are wonderful as for the politics I could not disagree with her more. This is a very politically and emotionally charged issue no matter your position. As for her being responsible for whether or not a woman chooses to breast feed by the opinions expressed by Hogg in this book: I do not agree. If it takes so little for a mother to quit breast feeding then maybe she just was not cut out for it. I *knew* breast feeding was the best for my kid so I do it...period. Some women just cannot or will not go the extra mile no matter what they read.

Listen to it over and over until you realize that very few artists have this ability to make this kind of sleepy albeit propulsive music and know that you have another amazing album in your collection.
B000021XS0|5.0|I wasn't going to write a review for this one, seeing that there were so many good ones already. However, I felt compelled none-the-less.    I would not consider myself a serious fan of DT. I have had I&W since its release and have always enjoyed it. However, it has always been one that would come out for a month or two and then get put away again for an extended period of time. A couple of years ago, I stumbled on a review of Change of Seasons and decided to pick it up. In the process, I also became curious about Scenes from a Memory. After some time finding it very difficult to put Change down (their interpretation of several pieces of familiar music is very impressive as is the title track), I decided to venture over to this disc as well.    Put simply, I have been unable to put this one away! For all the discussion around how this is great prog metal (this is prog metal at its best), this disc is so much more! This album delivers like repeat readings of a great book (Lord of the Rings, Dune, for example). Every listen brings a new feeling and a new meaning to some small portion of each and every song; a feeling or meaning that you did not hear the time before. Every time the album ends, you find yourself wondering if there was some other detail that you missed even though you swear you caught it all the last time you listened to it. Very few novels deliver like this disc does!    I have always enjoyed some of the better concept albums (PF's The Wall, QR's Operation: Mindcrime, Alan Parson's Tales of Mystery to name three). This is, overall, the best concept album I have ever experienced for the following reasons; a) the story line is clear, but not direct. It requires the listener's mind to be engaged, b) the music almost always seems to play directly into the story; the music never seems to be an \\"extra\\" outside the story, c)the songs/scenes flow together better than most plays and shows I have seen and better than any other album I have heard, and d) even theminute details bring meaning and value to the story. In short, you tend to find yourself wondering who has been hypnotised, Nickolas or you! Are those his dreams/memories or yours?    Since there are so many other reviews which go into much better detail than I will regarding technical ability and performance, I will limit my comments regarding the \\"orchestra\\" to just this one; the album is so engaging, only the best musical talent playing at the top of their game could have pulled this off this well.    This is an impressive outing for the band and is a bright reminder of just what rock is capable of when given over to the right hands with the right motivation! Of course, you will never hear this on radio, there isn't a DJ or station manager in the country with enough patience to play this one all the way through, which is really the best way to listen to it. Playing this in parts (as I tend to do while driving back and forth to work) will leave you frustrated or late to work (sitting in the parking lot listening to the rest of it)!    Through all of this, I have only one complaint...WHY DIDN'T I DISCOVER THIS 7 OR 8 YEARS AGO?!!!

But everyone says it's cool.<br />About package: 4 Discs packed in two slim amarays with carton slipcase over them. no book with episode guide. only 3 promotions.

006016848X|5.0|If you need to learn something about the opposite sex, this is the book for you! I'm amazed about how little we know about the opposite sex when I first read this book.  First, it explains that men and women are really different (we all know that) but it further explains HOW they are different and this means that men and women deal with problems, stress, relationships, & pretty much everything else differently. It is when we know the difference will we be able to get a glimpse of the \\"other side\\" and get a fuller & better understanding of why some things are the way they are. It also gives us tips & solutions of how we can embrace this difference and deal with our partners and relationships the way they should be dealt with. No more walking around blind in our relationships. No wonder this book is a classic. Just great! A must have!

I haven't heard other versions of this book, but I rented it from the library years ago and remembered for months after, I was nodding in appreciation of the ride.  Herbert had some brilliant ideas in here, and it is completely timeless...<br /><br />If you have a long commute to work and have an urge to move stuff around in your brain to the sound of expert sci-fi storytelling, this is for you.  There is a reason this book is a classic, and Guidall does it justice flawlessly.

B000001FDQ|5.0|A tempest visited my local record store in the form of a vinyl album with a strat engulfed in flames. I was a mere teenager back then when I took the plunge and laid down my cash on the counter.<br /><br />I'll never forget the moment when \\"Far Beyond the Sun\\" blasted through my speakers. I thought this boy made a deal with Satan himself! People thought the same thing of Paganini. I never really lived until I heard the master perform. I was taken to another reality. Eddie Van Who? Just kidding. Eddie is a giant as well. Anyway, Yngwie and me have never parted company since then. I'm now 37 and I still listen to this virtuoso of a guitar-playing viking.<br /><br />He was my drug by the way. When everyone was smoking something in H.S., Yngwie's music kept me in line. I never felt the need to do any kind of drugs. I'm serious.<br /><br />Please, if you ever want to hear the very best in hard rock guitar playing mixed with baroque elements, this is your man. He pushed the envelope much like Eddie and Hendrix did.<br /><br />By this now! [I'm trying to hypnotize you as I say this] Is it working?<br /><br />BY THIS NOW!<br /><br />P.S. When will he ever release a \\"remastered\\" edition of this classic CD?
B000P0J024|5.0|Kudos to the producers of this outstanding reissue package - it's no surprise this collection debuted in the top 10 of Billboard's albun chart, these records had been out of print for far too long.     Volume One needs little defense as it is nearly universally viewed as a fantastic collaboration between five great artists. Volume Three took a lot of knocks upon intitial release. It isn't as fun as the first one and arguably doesn't contain any stone-cold classics (like \\"Handle With Care\\" or \\"The End of the Line\\"). Plus with the passing of Roy Orbison, four similar-sounding voices were left - nothing to match the majesty of Orbison provided. All that said, I was surprised when reminded just how rocking the second album is - there's a real edge to tracks like \\"She's My Baby\\" and \\"Wilbury Twist.\\" My real complaint about Volume Three is that it seems so dominated vocally by Dylan and Petty. There is especially a relative lack of George Harrison vocals, which is strange considering the band was his brainchild and pet project. At least George's unmistakable lead guitar work is so prevelant throughout the album (much moreso than the first album).     The bonus tracks are mostly interesting - two previously issued tracks (that were both new to me) and two previously bootlegged but never officially available tracks (not only new to me, but at least kinda new to everyone, as they both feature unobtrusive additional instrumentation from Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison). Of the two covers, their version of Del Shannon's \\"Runaway\\" (rumored to have been considered as a replacement for Orbison) is a nice tribute, but stays a little too close to the original for it to be intersting. The other one, \\"Nobody's Child,\\" is genuinely sad and is effectively sung by each of the four Wilburys (recorded post-Orbison, as all four bonus tracks were). The two originals were both recorded during the Volume Three sessions. I can't believe George Harrison's \\"Maxine\\" was left off - it's a great, upbeat, acoustic-guitar driven song and is easily better than some of the album tracks (not to mention that Volume Three is a relatively short album to begin with). Including \\"Maxine\\" would've upped the Harrison content that I mentioned the album is sorely lacking. Dylan's \\"Like A Ship\\" is excellent as well - and far better than what I consider his weakest track on the the album, \\"7 Deadly Sins.\\"     The DVD is a great bonus - but unfortunately not a lot of work went into the mastering, as the picture quality is notably lacking (as are 5.1 mixes for the music). I probably won't return to it often, but the 25 minute documentary is a great look at the process of making the first movie. Actually I wouldn't have minded it being even longer, but even 'as is' the featurette demonstrates the laid-back atmosphere of the recording sessions. The music videos are fun to see again after all these years, but honestly they aren't extremely creative presentations. Best of the lot are \\"Handle With Care\\" (because it features all five Wilburys) and \\"End of the Line\\" (with it's touching visual representation of Orbison's absence).
B00005JPLW|4.0|The movie is thoroughly entertaining, violent, but unreal enough for it not to be disturbing.  There is so much CG that the whole thing really does have more the look of a drawing than a photo.    The thing the viewer needs to understand that this story is being told by the narrator, Dilios, and that much of it is obviously embellished or exaggerated.  Knowing that gives one the perspective to value the story and the visuals for what they are. I have never seen the book.  I hoped that the second disc would have more interesting features.  The most interesting ones were too short to give detail.  It would have been nice if they had included a bit more of the real (known) history of the battle and the circumstances surrounding it.  I might just have to do some research on my own.

B0001Z37HM|4.0|Though the excellent cover painting features Arnold Schwarzenegger's character most prominently, this cinematic masterpiece (well, maybe not) stars Brigitte Nielsen (from [[ASIN:6304779607 Cobra]]) in the title role, while Arnold only has a supporting role.  Showcasing hilariously horrendous acting and groan-inducing dialogue, `Red Sonja' is both terrible and magnificent at the same time.<br /><br />After an angelic blue ghost endows her with unequaled swordsmanship skills, Sonja the redheaded she-devil hops on her horse and races off on an epic quest to destroy a glowing green talisman before IT destroys the world.  The awesomely powerful talisman has fallen into the vile hands of the fiendish Queen Gedren, who is using the lime-colored orb to shatter kingdoms with storms and earthquakes.<br /><br />As the scarlet-cloaked warrior woman battles her way towards the evil Queen's stone castle, she meets up with Tarn, the child Prince of Hablok, and his portly, long-suffering slave, Falkon.  Red Sonja's decision to rescue the royal whelp from a thieving band of ruffians who are in the process of drawing and quartering him is perhaps a poor one, as Tarn (portrayed by Ernie Reyes, Jr. from [[ASIN:B0000696I0 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II - The Secret of the Ooze]]) is an intolerable BRAT the likes of which has not been seen in motion pictures before of since.  Young Tarn continually taunts his rotund servant with insulting epithets like \\"fool\\" and \\"clumsy oaf\\" while threatening to have him hung by the heels and/or impaled.  Sonja wisely advises Falkon to turn the ungrateful pup over his knee and beat some manners into him, but the fiercely loyal protector refuses.<br /><br />Much as she detests being aided by a man, Sonja is repeatedly assisted by the muscle-bound High Lord, Kalidor (portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California and star of [[ASIN:0783225504 Kindergarten Cop]] and [[ASIN:B000RW3VCK Commando (Director's Cut)]]), who is equally determined to see the dreaded phosphorescent talisman terminated...so to speak.  The valiant swashbuckler effortlessly mows down Gedren's black-clad soldiers and gouges out the metallic eyeballs of a vicious mechanical sea serpent.  Kalidor is instantly enamored with the flame-haired female fighter, but Sonja has made a vow: \\"No man may have me unless he has beaten me in a fair fight.\\"  Thus, their courtship is marked by the clanging of broadswords.<br /><br />Together, Sonja, Kalidor, Tarn and Falkon traverse the treacherous landscape of Burkubane--Land of Eternal Night--on their perilous mission to the great circular entrance of Gedren's lair.<br /><br />This DVD release from Warner Bros. has no special features, aside from the theatrical trailer, and it does not come with an insert.  The widescreen transfer is a little fuzzy and way too dark.

0385522401|3.0|This slim novel shifts back and forth between the thoughts of a young married couple on their wedding night. It's 1962, and the cultural and sexual revolutions are yet to come, and this couple suffers and stutters through a clumsy and (for the bride) repulsive physical encounter.  What is probably most important are the things NOT said, despite McEwan's skillful detailing of each of the couple's most minute thoughts.  All in all, it's a fast read with some amusement and exasperation - after all, it's hard to imagine a time not very distant wherein a man and woman would be so stifled as to let this one unsatisfactory night become the huge deal it does without being able to speak clearly to one another about ANYTHING.
B000ICM0YY|5.0|In my personal opinion, this is the best Beethoven Sonata cycle ever recorded. Emil Gilels is one of the best pianists ever, a real titan of the keyboard, a genius. This set is at a great price and I strongly recommend you to buy it.
0143038419|2.0|The first section in Italy started off great ... When she had her \\"this is not what my life was supposed to be\\" realization, I admired her willingness to change her life. I thought her writing was witty, I found her snarky insights amusing ... I totally wanted to be her friend. Then we got to India and it just kept getting more dull. Your Guru is great. Meditation is hard. You've made best friends with Richard from Texas (are you sure that wasn't Dr. Phil?). Next?    By the time we finished up in Indonesia, she seemed to have grown more whiney and insipid than she began ... crossing over from cute and quirky to repetitive and annoying. I completely lost interest.     The me, me, me self-centeredness of the book didn't bother me. It IS a personal memoir after all. But I really didn't see much evidence of spiritual growth and personal change. She kept SAYING she had changed. But her actions didn't really indicate it.     In the intro she stated that she wasn't going to use the real name of the ashram in India out of respect, its lack of resources, etc. Turns out ... she names it and links to it on her website. I bet business is booming. A little bit of research turned up a another fact unmentioned in the book ... she was paid an advance for writing this book, and that's how she could afford a year abroad (and wouldn't the publisher be disappointed if she came back from India without sitting in God's palm).
B000I2MRHE|4.0|My daughter just turned 3 months old and usually screams within 1 min of being put on her tummy. When I have put her on the tummy time mats with the pillow she usually finds a way to push herself off of it and screams with her face in the pillow. This is a neat idea. She fits perfect on the seat that spins. She is 23 inches long. That mat though is very small, much smaller than I thought it would be. The toys are fun. My daughter really has no interest in the toys yet, but does love the mirror. When I put her on it for the first time she smiled and laughed and watched herself in the mirror for about 5 minutes before she started to cry. I figure that is pretty good for a first try. She has only had it for a few days and still only stays on for about 5 minutes. She has not learned to spin yet. She enjoys me laying her on her back to the spinner and spinning her around the room though. Overall this is a fun toy for her to play on with or w/o the spinner. I think she will enjoy this toy when she is able to sit on her own. I don't think though that this will help her learn to crawl like good old fashion tummy time.
0743506650|5.0|I got this book in an audio format and was thilled that Stephen King read it himself and thus breathed more life into the story.<br /><br />He insists that there is no special magic trick that makes one a better writer, yet he offers many helpful suggestions based on his lifelong experience.  His main suggestion is a good common-sense advice:  read a lot and write a lot.<br /><br />As much as this is a book on writing, it is also a book about his personal life.  I found it heartwarming to listen to Stephen express feelings of gratitude and deep love for his wife.<br /><br />At the end of the book he talked about the accident he survived, an accident which had an uncanny resemblance to a scene from one of his books.  I remembered when I caught the news about that accident in some newspaper. The journalist said \\"how odd\\", and I thought how amazing that Stephen King never noticed before that as he created horror scenes in his subjective reality, he was setting them up to occur in some way in his objective reality.  As within, so without, as the saying goes.  I am happy that he came out of it in one piece and that he continued to write.
1596912855|4.0|This book is not written in Shannon Hale's normal literary style.  Normally she is much more poetic with the use of line,imagery, and the flow of the story.  That being said, I was surprised to see this book written along the lines of \\"Can you Keep a Secret?\\" by Sopie Kinsella. (this book was minus the profanity and sex.) I read this book with the idea that I was just going to be girly, and enjoy a sappy, \\"girls just want to have fun reading, without thinking too hard about it- night\\". I really enjoyed this book for the cute Pride and Prejudice references, and the fun ending.  I feel like Shannon is an excellent author, who writes what interests or amuses her...yikes, let her have some freedom!   I would highly reccomend this book for a fun, clean, read.  You can finish it in under three hours while your kids are asleep!  Get that bubble bath started!

B000JJRIN4|2.0|I'm not sure what is happening to the music nowadays; it seems like instead of heading forward and better, it's going backwards and worser.

B000RMQH30|4.0|If you have soul then YES YOU SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM. When this first came out I wrote a sort of crappy review but after listening for months now I finally get this album and love every bit of it. They won't let me change my star review from four to five but let me tell you it is A FIVE STAR ALBUM. It harkens back to 70's soul music and deserves to be put on the shelf next to all the greats. The sad thing is that Ben Harper has no interest in being on the radio or mtv so there is so many people who just don't know that there is great new music out there and true living legends that are under the age of 55! Just havin fun with that.     The music on this album just flows and seems to have influence coming from everyone from Otis Redding to Marvin Gaye to Wilson Pickett and there's even a song that has a harmonica in it resembling a bit of Neil Young. Its just to me the perfect jam album. Thats all I can really say is that the album just Jams, it moves your spirit and makes you wanna dance. I'm obviously not so good at words so just do yourself a favor and if you're one who cannot remain sitting down whenever you hear Motown Soul or Funk comin out of some speakers then get this album.
0316067598|5.0|This is by far one of the best book I have ever read.  I shows how our troops have their hands tied by the politicians. So much so, they are afraid to take the correct \\"military\\" action for fear of being sent to trial for murder. As a result, our people are dying needlessly.    It is time that the politicians wake up and stay the hell out of the military's way. Every politician should be made to read this book, and every American should read it also.      Well written and thought provoking.
B00008O89K|5.0|Basil Poledouris' movie musical scores crossed many genre from western to fantasy.  This music from `Conan the Barbarian' stands as one of the best and most sweeping majestic pieces in his repertoire.  The music mixes very well with the movie and carries the action, suspense and pathos.  As has been stated by others, there are two version of this soundtrack one from Milan with 12 tracks and the other from Varese Sarabande with 16 tracks.  Just keep in mind that for the extra 4 tracks on the Varese Sarabande album you will need to pay a premium price.  That is because the Varese album is out of print and who knows when it will be re-released.  There really is no wrong choice between the two.  The trade-off basically comes down to how much of the music budget to spend.  Varese is more music for  far more money and Milan is less music for far less money.  Most listeners will be happy with this 12 track Milan album.  Those who want the extra minutes of musical score will want to seek out the Varese album but be prepared for  sticker shock. Maybe Varese Sarabande will put out a limited collector's edition on this?<br /><br />Loaded with wonderful orchestral arrangements, this album is well worth adding to the soundtrack collection.
B00005JCAA|5.0|Wow.  A classic.  What happens when Death wants a wealthy man to give him a personal tour through life?  Very wonderfully portrayed.  Suspense.  You are riveted to the screen even though its 3 hours!  The performances are masterful.  I've watched it 6 or 7 times already.  Won't be the last.
0618680004|1.0|I felt as if the book was written by a religious zealot.  Only the religion in this instance is the belief in no God.  In particular Dawkins' cheap ploys (i.e., using some statistical finding out of context or citing some unknown text to embellish his point) cheapen his earlier works like the Selfish Gene and the Blind Watchmaker which, unlike this book, are worth reading.

0375423877|3.0|The problems Botswana's Lady Detective, Mma Ramotswe solves aren't solved in a masterful way, ala Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.  Yet there is a sweetness to this story that pervades.  The relationships amongst the people are deep, and dear.<br />Would that the protagonist had more complex problems to solve.  Or that the one difficult problem wasn't abetted in a contrived situation.  How interesting is it to read about someone being followed and a problem being solved just like that!<br />Nevertheless, the patois seems authentic.  There is a lyrical quality to the dialog that is enchanting.  It's also a relief to read about any African country without hearing stories of bloodshed and depravity.<br />I'm going to read some more books in this series.
1582701709|1.0|Is how I would summarize my take on this one.  I wouldn't give it to my kids as it sets the wrong value expectations.  There are a few redeeming parts where ever so briefly there is a touch point with spiritual or scientific  depth.  If you are seriously seeking don't waste your time on this one. I thought of donating the it to my local library, but I actually threw it in the garbarge.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Given the two-hour time constraint, I felt this movie stayed quite true to the novel on which it is based, much more so than the recent Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley. The actors and their acting were also much more attuned to the time period in which the story takes place. I would recommend this film even to diehard Jane Austen fans.

0393061434|3.0|Steve Wozniak is interesting because he helped found Apple.  This book is not about that time in his life.  It covers it, but only minimally.  Less than a quarter of the book covers this time period.  In fact, it is over half done before Apple even really gets mentioned.  Instead, this book is about Steve Wozniak himself.  It's about his high school science projects, his pranks, and his philosophy of life.  Steve is a little different than other people and it comes through in this book.  He talks very highly of his accomplishments and often frames them as more important or unique than they really were.  He did good work, but not all of what he claims he was first to do was he truly first.<br />I love Steve Wozniak, but this book was just too much about the small things in his life to be interesting to me.
0893860220|5.0|A well done summary of Sri N.M.'s advice to seekers.  It doesn't take long to catch the simple principles that lead to greater insights into the divine self.  While the documented dialog does get repetitive after a point it still compels the reader to further introspection and engagement.  Highly recommended for the serious seeker.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|this movie is truely a Frank Miller comic come to life. dont hesitate on this one. and hd dvd really brings out the visuals. the extra pip feature showing the film as shot in studio compared to the theatrical release is well done. a must buy.
B00005JPLW|3.0|If you're familiar with the comic book adaptation movie genre, ala Sin City, you'll recognize the same approach in 300. As a historical drama the movie is flawed, but as a doomed buddy film its entertaining.  The parallels to the current day political scene are obvious.  The racial overtones of the movie were unnecessary.  It's a good movie to watch once or twice, but its not one that I'll go back to time and time again.
B000002GF8|5.0|If you listen for a while to The Police, there is no question this is a very important band in the evolution of rock.  The Police married punk, reggae, and new wave and turned into something unique and never duplicated.    Still, the influence of the band lives on for many reasons.  One is the incredible musicianship of the band.  Each band member was a great musician, and there is something to be learned about songcraft in listening to The Police.  Drummers, guitarists, bassists, vocalists -- all have plenty of lessons to learn listening to The Police.    Anyway, that is why is hard to call this record a Police album.  More than any other record, this album sounds like Sting dictating the content, with the other band members doing his bidding.  In the case of Andy Summers, there are long stretches where he simply disappears altogether from the sound.    One can only imagine there was a battle going on.  At the same time Eddie Van Halen was fighting David Lee Roth's rejection of Eddie's growing keyboard fetish, Sting was trying to render Summers contribution irrelevant by taking over harmonic duties previously provided brilliantly by Summers' guitar with Sting's new keyboard toys.    Now, listening back, one could see this coming slowly.  Hits like \\"Everything She Does Is Magic\\" and \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\\" are pretty heavy on the keyboard.  Not to mention the incredible overmix of the bass that also suggests Sting's ego outgrowing the band.    I believe this is a Sting album in Police clothing.  If so, it is certainly Sting's greatest album by a long shot.  But, with due respect to what The Police are about, I do not believe this is a true Police album.    Still a fantastic album that should be owned certainly by any serious songwriter who is interested in what moves the pop masses.    One final note -- Sting is often mentioned as a great vocalist.  I believe this is true, but I do not believe he is a great lyricist like, say, some his countrymen like John Lennon or Roger Waters.  Sting's brilliance as a vocalist comes in the phrasing and melody, not in the word choice.  Sometimes, the words are a bit silly but the phrasing is incredible.  At this best, Sting's lyrics are good, but seem like a sort of strained literary style -- like someone desperate to prove that he reads books.      Regardless, Sting certainly shows incredible polish and discipline in his songwriting in Synchronicity -- which is a high point in Sting's career but sadly not for The Police as a whole.
0618680004|5.0|This is hands down the best look at atheism from a compassionate humanist and scientist.  Richard Dawkins factual, direct, and unoffensive review of religions and the forces behind them is compelling and engaging.  Highly recommended, one of my new favorite books.

B00005QGAZ|5.0|Think what you will about Michael, but you cannot deny him his title of the \\"King of Pop.\\" There has never been a CD like \\"Thriller.\\" It is the most creative and artistic CD in all of pop history. And there probably will never be another one like it. All the songs on this CD are magical. My favorite is \\"Billie Jean.\\" This is one of those rare CDs that has such strong tracks; no fillers on this one.

B000SO7OMA|5.0|I was lucky enough to be at the concerts at Charles V (Carlos V) rotunda in the Alhambra both nights that they were filming for this DVD and the third night when Lorena performed in the Generalife without TV - also in the Alhambra complex.  All three nights were pure magic and this DVD and CD combination bring it all back.  Absolutely, totally, with out question, utterly and truly magnificent.

B00005JPOE|5.0|I grew up in West Africa, which makes this movie very personal to me. But, more than that is the fact that William Willberforce was a man of faith and character. I wish those two traits coincided more! This movie is worth seeing not only for it's well produced filmography and excellent acting, but also for it's edifying qualities. How often can we say that about Hollywood? :)

0743496728|2.0|Several friends raved about this book but I was not impressed.  My niece and nephew attended Columbine so maybe I was too sensitive, but it just felt like she \\"borrowed\\" too much from that tragedy. I could see the mother's relationship with the police officer coming from a mile away...and why did Josie have to go to jail for 4 years?  That did not make any sense at all..nothing about her defense or trial...This book was just OK...nothing more
0800177177|2.0|With the talent involved in this one, it should have been great, but with all the attention on the look of the movie, they forgot to give the creature a soul. Gary Oldman is also a very poor Dracula, and along with Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder give the film no one to care about. Still the film looks good! JUST NO LIFE INSIDE!!!!

B000RJO578|5.0|Pegg and Wright have penned another side-splitter! Following the daunting success of \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" it seemed this duo was doomed to failure (just in the same way that Broken Lizard could never SEEM to live-up to their epic-success \\"Super Troopers\\"). Nonetheless, \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is equally as clever, insightful, and hysterical as their popular zombie flick. And, equally as niche: comedy-mystery! What's more, if you are hesitant to purchase this film for fear of not understanding \\"British humor,\\" you can dismiss those worries entirely!! While this film's humor transcends cultural-boundaries, you may find it amusing that it makes constant reference to popular American film (\\"Point Break\\" and \\"Bad Boys\\" being the most obvious) and popular American culture (like Judge Judy). Moreover, it is helpful to watch the film with the captions on ... this way some of the  subtle word-play will be more easily caught (like the Judge Judy bit!!)    Stylistically, the film is a gem! If only American comedy was this slick! The framing is spectacular! As well as the repetition of shape!! (Like the spiral of the tombola drum juxtaposed with the spiral of the church stair-case ... so smart, so funny, so very pleasing!!) And in \\"Hot Fuzz,\\" you will find echoes of \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\" Most prominent, you will note an emphasis on day-to-day rituals: \\"What will it be? (The pub)\\" \\"Do you want anything from the shop?\\" ... and then how these rituals are \\"turned on their head\\" by the film's conclusion. The result is deeply satisfying for the viewer. Likewise, you will find a similar soundtrack and use of cuts (like the \\"swish\\" sounds and quick cuts to indicate ritual). Again, both are tremendously successful and a hallmark of either Wright's direction or how this team elects to communicate ideas.    If you dig cop-comedy, buddy-flicks, the previous works of Pegg and/or Wright, or (one of my favorite Broken Lizard films) \\"Club Dread\\" (another comedy-mystery), you should thoroughly enjoy \\"Hot Fuzz.\\"

B00003CX5P|5.0|It's not my favorite, but still very enjoyable.    I enjoyed 'Star Wars' (a.k.a. Star Wars IV: A new hope) when it came out and I was 7 yrs old and I still love all the Star Wars Movies today.  My son has loved all the Star Wars movies as well
1582701709|2.0|The message of this book is \\"Just be positive and it will all turn out fine\\". When you have little to lose or bogged down with negative thinking, this message can be motivating. But when you can suffer substantial losses by ignoring negativity, this philosophy is dangerous and can even be catastrophic.  Most sane people back up their computers!      I recommend two top-notch books for the genuine seeker.  The first book [[ASIN:0471414646 Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self]], shows you how to maximize your thinking, best deal with negativity, and create your best life and career. The other book is [[ASIN:1400078393 Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life]] contrasts optimism and pessimism.  Both of these books are invaluable, and will empower you to soar above unrealistic optimism.
B00003CXCT|5.0|What can you say - Star Wars Trilogy is great.    Sure the acting is subpower in all the Star Wars movies IMHO.  But the story line is awesome.
1582701709|5.0|It is a very good and inspiring book that has helped me stay focus on what I am dreaming of. It has enabled me to change my worries and negative thoughts into positive ones. It is not easy, and the change is not instantaneous, but re-reading the book helps a lot to keep concentrating on the positive thoughts; thereby transmitting positive frequency to the universe which I am sure and believe will transmit all those positive signals to my loved one who is now a globe away from me. I am very positive we will be together soon. The book has helped me resume our relationship that has grown cold because of time and distance. I do recommend everyone to read this book - it is a really good book that helps us see more of the good and positive sides of everything in our lives.

B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Avril really found a winning formula with her third studio album `The Best Damn Thing' and after repeated listenings I'm forced to agree that this very well may be her best damn album.  I've always been a fan of Avril, her previous two albums have been in my CD-Player for quite some time, but here Avril really shines.  As some have noted, this is a different sound for Avril, but it's in that different direction that she really becomes her own artist.  She's still able to infuse some of the maturity that made her album `Under My Skin' so good, but she adds so many layers of fun to her music this go around that you realize the type of girl Avril has become.  She's not so bitter anymore, she's not so angry all the time but instead is happy with the way her life is going and it shows on just about every song.  Her voice is still just as crisp and her hooks are just as infectious but with the addition of the schoolgirl chants (very `Holla Back Girl') she has brought her music to a whole new level.<br /><br />The single `Girlfriend' is so freaking brilliant I don't really know what else I can say about it.  I wasn't sold upon the first listen but the track is so infectious it's impossible not to be taken over by it eventually.  It opens the album perfectly, but Avril doesn't allow the album to slow down one bit, always delivering another slice of head-bopping pie.  The second cut off the album `I Can Do Better' is just as good as `Girlfriend' and certainly just as infectious.  Upon just one listen you'll find yourself mouthing words you don't really know and bopping your head along with a rhythm you're none-to-familiar and it feels pretty damn good!  `Runaway' is decent, but nothing as good as its two predecessors.  It's nothing to get down about though, that's just one song.  `The Best Damn Thing' immediately makes up for it with a chorus that demands your bottom leave your seat.<br /><br />In fact most of `TBBT' greatest moments are found in these songs, the ones that make you move.  `Everything Back but You' has that same feel.  To be completely honest Avril has finally found that pop/punk sound she's been condemned for attempting.  Especially on `Everything Back but You' she comes off very Blink 182/Green Day (you know before Green Day went political and lost their appeal).  Who ever thought those few choice words would fit her so well (you know what words I'm talking about).  `Hot' sounds very classic Avril, like something you would have heard off her previous albums.  It's good, but when compared to her new style it's just not as good.  She definitely learned a thing or two from her husbands band Sum 41 for when listening to `One Of Those Girls' you could almost swear Sum 41 was playing her music for her.  `Contagious' is a nice track but it's not the most memorable.  `I Don't Have to Try' starts off a bit odd but quickly turns into another great upbeat track (with a few choice words thrown in just about everywhere).<br /><br />Now, one of the best things about `Under My Skin' was the maturity that came across in some of Avril's slower balladesque type tracks.  Thankfully, while there aren't many, Avril still delivers to us three outstanding ballad tracks that shine so brightly it's undeniable.  Starting with `When Your Gone' Avril immediately establishes her strength.  Her voice is perfectly suited for the power of the chorus as well as the subtlety within the verses.  She gives her all to `Innocence' as well, another outstanding effort.  The piano work really adds layers to the beauty of the track.  And we can thank `K*Ville' and `So You Think You Can Dance' for exposing the pure brilliance that is `Keep Holding On', the perfect way to close out this album.  Its elegance is so effortless it sounds as if it's coming from a completely different artist all together.  We surely will keep holding on till Avril blesses us once again.`Everything Back but You' has that same feel.

B000RMQH30|5.0|This album is different to other BH-releases in many ways. First of all the genesis of this record was very different than on previous ones. The album was recorded at a long tour about to end in Paris and it was done with all members of the Innocent Criminals putting in their own input in many ways. Then there's the way how it was recorded: in one week on full-analogue vintage equipment. Oh yes, and it was recorded in Paris, France.    The other difference to Ben Harper's earlier albums is that there's not great variation of different styles. This is an acoustic-soul album, like the band already had said. The songs are great in my opinion and the band plays really tight and groovy and Ben's singing is better and more powerful than ever before.    The record is very coherent and really works as an album. It's a pleasure to listen to it from the beginning to the end.    I know that this isn't what a number of fans were expecting but I think that this is a great piece of music and am glad that Ben Harper always does something which is a bit different than things's he has done before.    Oh, and I'm really jealous of the american people that have the opportunity to attend the shows of the Lifeline-tour this fall in the US.    Buy this album, it's really great!
0800132009|3.0|The film shows a tropical jungle, then we see a railroad. There are graves along the railway. There is a settlement, these workers are captured British army men. A new group enters the camp whistling a song. The Japanese Colonel Saito welcomes them and tells how they will build a railroad from Bangkok to Rangoon. Escape is impossible. &#34;Be happy in your work.&#34; There will be no escape committee, the odds are against it. The British commander will cooperate with the Japanese since they were ordered to surrender.<br /><br />There is a crisis when the British commander Colonel Nicholson refuses to order the officers to perform manual labor, even after a deadly threat. They are left standing in the hot sun without water or food until they are sent to the punishment hut. But a few try to escape across the river. Their bodies are brought back, except for one man who fell into the river. Trees are cut to build a timber bridge. The project is behind schedule, Colonel Saito blames the workers. Saito makes an offer to Colonel Nicholson: cooperate or the hospital will be closed.<br /><br />Commander Shears makes it to a village and is rescued. Colonel Saito proclaims a holiday and gives the prisoners Red Cross parcels (saving them from starvation). There is a problem in building the bridge. Colonel Nicholson is brought to meet Colonel Saito, and they reach a &#34;proper solution&#34; after a dramatic confrontation. An amnesty ends the stalemate. Work will continue with the British officers in charge. [The film claims the British could do a better job than the Japanese through organization and efficiency. The future would tell more about this.] New plans are adopted.<br /><br />British Force 316 asks Shears for help with their project. Major Warden explains their use of &#34;plastic&#34;. This force will parachute a team to destroy the bridge. &#34;Commander Shears&#34; explains himself, and gets another unexpected surprise. &#34;Good Show!&#34; Back at the prison camp they are all happy in their work, morale is high because they are doing a proper job. [Sarcasm here?] Force 316 parachutes into the jungle, but there is a problem. They must take a roundabout route to their destination. [This is also safer than a regular path.] Colonel Nicholson is totally devoted to finishing the bridge, he even asks patients from the hospital to volunteer! Birds fly into the air, the unexpected happens. They arrive at the bridge and plan its destruction. They must wait until the scheduled train arrives on the bridge. The sentries pacing over the bridge add to the suspense. Nature presents a complication. Colonel Nicholson sees a strange object and follows the lead to an ironic ending.<br /><br />Pierre Boulle wrote many novels. What changes were made for this film? Does the bridge resemble the famous railway bridge on the Firth of Forth?
1572814349|5.0|I bought these for the the visual aesthetic and i am 100% pleased. The collages are beautiful and done masterfully. The cards symbolisms are easily seen throughout this deck making it easy for you to understand. If your at all a fan of medieval artwork this set is a winner.
B000001ESN|4.0|Some bands put out amazing, classic albums.  But more rarely, truly fantastic and important bands put out a series, usually a trilogy, oddly enough, of classic, must-have albums that make it difficult to pick a favorite of the three.  Some examples: Sonic Youth's \\"Evol\\", \\"Sister\\" and \\"Daydream Nation\\" - Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", and \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", or in this case, Rush's \\"Permanent Waves\\", \\"Moving Pictures\\" and \\"Signals\\" (the last one took me a long time to appreciate but it's as good as the other two.)  This is a classic, but I was disappointed at the \\"REMASTERED SERIES\\" on the spine.  I had a CDR copy of the original CD issue and this sounds no different, not better, and there is ABSOLUTELY NO INFO about how this was supposedly \\"remastered\\", etc.  As someone who does mastering work as a side-line living, I checked out the CD by running it through a couple programs to analyze it, and it's not at all anything like it could be.  That said, it's a Must Have album that I now have on CD, and sadly, I just don't play my vinyl any more, so it's time to donate that to the local college station.  Just having this on CD is great, and unlike the aforementioned bands, Rush gets a major cut of the profits from sales as it is \\"co-released\\" on their own \\"Anthems\\" label, so unlike when it was originally released, they'll get $5-6 in their pockets vs. a thin (dime).  As for the album, best not to read the lyrics but enjoy how Geddy Lee makes them, well, enjoyable, aside from \\"The words of the Profits were written on the studio walls\\", which I honestly didn't realize was \\"Profits\\", not \\"prophets\\".  But if you're a thinking person, reading the lyrics will drive you nuts, and since there's absolutely NO INFO about how this was supposedly \\"REMASTERED\\", just put it in, play it, and enjoy it.  \\"Spirit of the Radio\\" is one of the best classic rock/driving songs/rock songs ever written, ever.  And I mean, like ever.  Dude. I still get tingles up my spine hearing the opening riffs and hearing the first couple of lines of lyrics. And \\"Entre Nous\\" is indeed one of the best \\"love songs\\" ever written, since unlike the rest, it suggests that maybe couples should have lives apart from each other.  Novel idea, that.  Anyway, you know this album or you don't, and if you do, just buy it, the price is right.ng the opening riffs and hearing the first couple of lines of lyrics.

0670888443|4.0|I really like Jon Scienszka - especially _The Stinky Cheese Man and other tales_; but I suspect his stories are geared for a slightly older audience (age 5 and up) than for younger children, as the humor in _The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs_ is a bit sophisticated for younger (and more literal) children.<br /><br />With that said, the premise - that the Big Bad Wolf is misunderstood, and the deaths of the 3 Little Pigs was just a big misunderstanding - is great: I like the idea of teaching children to empathize and think beyond the literal.  And certainly children will develop this as they grow.  I do recommend the book - the art, the story and the telling of it are masterfully done.  However think about the relative intellectual maturity of the audience before buying ... it may be good wine before its time.
0393327655|5.0|The End of Faith is the watershed book for uniting rational, spiritual--and yes, libertarian--humanists in an unprecedented worldwide exercise in the elevation of consciousness. Several books recently have taken up the cause of releasing our minds from specters of the past, particularly any sorts of deities that insist upon abandonment of natural reason for salvation.<br /><br />All published in 2006, we have Harris's own Letter to a Christian Nation, which cleverly skewers the most extreme faith-based positions of too many of our neighbors; UK scientist and author Richard Dawkins gave us The God Delusion, a more academic dance around the escape hatches from reality; and on the lighter side we got The Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) by the one and only Bobby Henderson.<br /><br />Right, Bobby Henderson, who built a letter he wrote to the Kansas School Board (advocating equal time for the FSM vs. teaching of Intelligent Design) into a modern satirical dynasty--complete with t-shirts and coffee cups.<br /><br />These other works are fine, yet they lack the passion, urgency of mission, scope, and the pure moral and intellectual courage behind Sam Harris's magnum opus... to date. When I first saw his following marvelous, incisive quotes in a Playboy magazine article in January of '05, I rushed out to Borders to buy the book:<br /><br />\\"Religious violence is still with us because our religions are intrinsically hostile to one another. Where they appear otherwise, it is because secular interests have restrained the most lethal improprieties of faith.

1582701709|4.0|The author of this book gathers over 29 teachers from the past and present together to teach her readers \\"the secret\\" that has been passed down through the generations from spiritual leaders, successful people, and avatars. This is done through  each of the all stars in the field of success writing material for this book, over half of this book is from these success coaches. \\"The Secret\\" is the law of attraction. What we think, believe, say, and do will create our reality. I agree with this and have seen it play out in my own life by always boldly believing in achieving things that seemed crazy to other people. DO you belief you are poor and will always be poor, well you are right. Are you poor but believe you will be rich, you will. How does it work? The book gets a little to mystical for me describing like attracts like through similar vibrations of energy. For me, after you absolutely believe something about yourself, you will behave and act that way. You will do the things that match your belief. You will create your reality and grow into what you believe about yourself. That is why religious conversion is so powerful, belief. Through your beliefs you will create your life to match what you think it should be. It is a self fulfilling prophecy. Though the book seems to be a little disorganized in thought, it is a very tough principle to explain and does get its point through. It is very powerful if this principles are taken as true and acted upon, I know that for a fact.
0140042520|5.0|One of the most often used metaphors for inner growth is the travel journal and I'm sure Kerouac would have enjoyed Gurdjieff's somewhat autobiograhical travel novel \\"Meetings with Remarkable Men.\\" Has this generation (2007) not yet found it's Dharma Bums? Maybe the line between literature and music is blurring (thanks to Dylan, Bob that is). Where is the excitement of adventure that leaps off the pages of these books stirring an energy to do something now, to seek, to find, to discover!!    I would have every 14-20 year-old in America read Dharma Bums (and Electric Kool Aid Acid Test)... it's up to YOU to put some adventure in YOUR LIFE... IT'S YOUR LIFE!

B000J3EEBY|4.0|I ve waited sooooo long for her to finally come out with a new album since \\"the book of secrets\\"...and she doesnt dissapoint with this one. Im glad to see she continued to use middle eastern influences giving her music an exotic twist. As always, her music sends me into a world of reveries, wether it may be travelling across the sahara caravan style or finding myself walking the lush green grasslands of ireland. The only reason i wont give this album a 5 star is because to this date she can never top my all time favorite song \\"mystics dream\\" from the album \\"the mask and the mirror\\". I only hope now...that she wont take this long to come out with her next album.  If you liked her previous albums \\"the mask and the mirror, and the book of secrets\\" you will love this one.
B000002G85|5.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various music supplies and recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />July of 1970 legions of E.C. fans were assembled in the local record shop to procure Clapton's first solo recording.  As the rumors became reality that it wouldn't be Cream or Blind Faith revisited, there were millions of ears that needed to encompass the material.<br /><br />One look at the writing credits on the original disc show E.C. was responsible for at least part if not all of 10 of the 11 tracks. The exception being J.J. Cale's \\"After Midnight.\\" If the critics had a red pen they were sorely disappointed that it wouldn't be leaving their hands.  \\"Slunky\\"  throws the kitchen sink at you.  A bit of everything with horns included.  Clapton is relaxed but in focus.  \\"Lonesome And A Long Way From Home\\" with friends Bonnie Bramlett and Delaney Bramlett (E.C. had toured with them) either sublimely or on the surface (Take your pick) talks about being alone for the first time.  Gone are the Yardbirds, Bluesbreakers, Cream, and Blind Faith!  \\"After Midnight\\" would become an Album Rock staple for decades.  Clapton vocals sound superlative and the arrangement properly showcases the musicians without overkill.  The first time you absorb the wonder of \\"Easy Now\\" it dawns on you that Clapton has never gotten enough accolades for his singing.  \\"Blues Power\\" lets the six string shine and with perfect construction has seen many Clapton fans proudly place this in their Top 10 solo E.C. tunes.  The longest song on the record clocking in at 5:02 also finishes the festivities.  \\"Let It Rain\\" is so well crafted that any artist on any record could be proud to see inclusion.<br /><br />If one of the truly great solo recordings needed one more attribute (It doesn't but we welcome gifts) the remaster includes both the originally released Tom Dowd mix and the Bramlett mix with some bonus tracks.  One in particular will blow you away.  \\"She Rides\\" is \\"Let It Rain\\" with different words and wouldn't tarnish the original LP if it showed up in this form!<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\".

B000OCXFCO|5.0|In a sea of musical crap, Megadeth still proves it can deliver the goods. This album is more of a return to their old school sound i.e. R.I.P. and Count Down. Old school influences can be heard like Diamond Head and escpecially Iron Maiden, listen to Washington is Next it sounds like a souped up version of Moon Child. This album is a little more political with topics like the call to war, Afghanistan, the U.N., Nato, and the events of 9\11. Mustaine delivers a wonderful performance on vocals and guitar as well. Great album through and through, highly recommended!!
6304498969|5.0|Eric Clapton Unplugged is an intimate portrait of the performer and the man.  This program was taped shortly after the death of Clapton's 5 year old son, Connor.  The touching piece, \\"Tears in Heaven,\\" is a result of that sad experience.  In spite of that, the program is upbeat and enjoyable and boasts a new and well received version of the classic \\"Layla.\\"  I watch this edition of Unplugged regularly:  I think of it as comfort food for the ears.
1579125549|5.0|This is a useful book that can be enjoyed anywhere you go. It's enormous though, at 3 inches thick and 1000+ pages. Polgar's \\"Chess\\" is almost entirely diagrammatic, which is its strength. No board necessary unless you play through the brief section of 600 miniatures at the end, which are themselves grouped by focal points (h2/h7, g2/g7, etc), ala Vukovic.  This book is simple. The great bulk of it shows pictures of positions, 6 per page, and it's up to you to figure them out - almost entirely 1, 2, and 3-move checkmate problems, a small section of these at the end dealing with positions from the Polgar sisters' games.  If you love puzzles, this has about 5000 of them. There is just enough space at the top and bottom of each page to pencil in your answers and all variations (if any) in the margins.  Most are 2-move mates. (You move, opponent moves, you move and mate on the move). The 1-move mates section is very brief, meant for abject beginners, along with a tiny section on game rules and a description of how to read chess notation.   Some of the puzzles can get tricky, at least for this reviewer. Most are in sparse, atomized endgame positions with lots of variation possibilities to keep track of. I've agonized over a few of them to make them work in all variations with the move limit.    There are a very small few positions that are hokey, for lack of a better word.  I was transfixed on one for hours, convinced it was faulty, until I finally realized my king and rook were still in pre-castling position.  This problem (#1558) was in one of those endgames where nearly everything is obliterated save 5 pieces between both players, and you castling figures into the solution. I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but that kind of problem is a little less than useful, as it seems gimmicky - in this case almost like a test of whether one is aware that castling is still possible in a sparse endgame you just wandered up to as a spectator but not as a player. The eureka momentof solving this wasn't entirely satisfying! Likewise, watch out for the en passant puzzles.  There are a couple of those too, where the position is right at that moment when the opponent's pawn just moved two ranks and bypassed one of yours the move before - not that you know this going into your evaluation - and this fact figures into the solution because the key move is the e.p. capture on the 3rd rank. OK! Fortunately, again, very few of these. There are also plenty of \\"underpromotion\\" puzzles, which are indeed useful and neat, and actually much more obvious and real.  In general, though, the book improved my tactical ability to see the board. I still haven't solved every problem and likely won't for years.  A huge volume of the positions deal with set-ups for swallowtail and dovetail mates and mates that utilize that basic shape, where the queen is mating on a square directly horizontally/vertically adjacent or diagonally adjacent to the king, and the two squares behind him that she can't cover are inaccessible to the enemy king either by two of the opponent's pieces or the scope of check by one or more of your pieces. I now recognize this pattern almost instinctively, but it doesn't seem to come up in my games quite as much as in the book.    My big criticism is mostly about the fact that if you know you have 2 moves to get mate, you can search for any possibility where after your move your opponent can check your own king, which would cause you (in most cases) to lose a tempo getting out of it if you allowed that. If your opponent can indeed check your king - even with a stupid spite sac - then the candidate moves you most immediately look at are going to be checks, and you can pretty much toss out any idea of a waiting move or a set up move as the correct answer. This makes the solution much easier as it narrows candidate moves, often significantly and even sometimes reducing the solution to having only one piece on the board that even *can* check the other king right away. This point isn't etched in granite or anything, but for the most part it's a fundamental dictum of the easy way to get through a problem, and while the simple answer is not to think about it quite that way, the temptation can be daunting once you are aware of this dynamic at all. In a real game, you don't always have the luxury to know ahead of time \\"X moves to mate\\" and often it is irrelevant as mate is clearly X+Y moves away anyway or a harmless check doesn't change anything. In such situations you don't need the most efficient solution, and so the \\"2 moves to win\\" thing doesn't apply unless you happen to see it yourself right off, but that's none of it the fault of the puzzle-maker; it's the fault of \\"mate in X\\" chess puzzles by their very nature. Still, the most efficient solution *is* the point; it's where the brain exercise happens. And it does clean up your tactical prowess by virtue of finding the very most forcing continuation, so ho hum. I did fly through a bunch of them because of this, though.  Anyway, a great book. Just in terms of sheer volume of exercise, this is just as beneficial as playing your scales and etudes in music. Plenty of other fish in the sea for tactics problems and pattern recognition, some I think a little more thematic and practical, though none with this much material at this price. Good tool for keeping sharp.
B000RK3JOC|5.0|Of course, if you really are a math nerd, it doesn't take long to fall in love with Colin, our dear hero. He's a geeky, nerdy, anagram-loving high school graduate, waiting to start his college life. The outline is simple: Colin's been dumped. He's depressed. Quirky, hilarious best friend Hassan declares that there's only one thing to do - road trip.<br /><br />That's how Colin ends up in a hole in the wall type town, working alongside Hassan and a girl named Lindsey, who essentially is the reason they even stayed in town. Lindsey is an interesting character, normal, and intelligent, something Colin doesn't really expect when they first meet (he sees her reading a trashy magazine and assumes he's dealing with someone ignorant and stupid). Colin meanwhile becomes obsessed with creating a formula that accurately portrays his 19 failures with Katherines. The story thus progresses.<br /><br />If there's one thing that's great about \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\", it's that there's something for everyone. Math nerds will love the concept. Teens will love the characters. Adults will love the humor. Or just everything, because it's fun to love. It's a great book, one that will suck you in from the first moment and keep you until the end. Funny characters and interesting situations keeps this book moving.<br /><br />Perhaps this is more appropriate for teens, who will let some minor issues go more easily (the ending was nice and good, but not as incredible as the rest of the book...). Even so, adults will be just as able to enjoy this fun, funny, enjoyable book.<br /><br />(P.S. The footnotes are probably the best part)

0380799006|2.0|This book, proposing to teach parents how to raise siblings who don't hate each other and whose adult lives aren't still ruled by childish pain, contains a few gems.  I will keep from it several bits of insight as I raise my two kids.    However, I found much of this book far too simplistic.  I was turned off by the pages of cartoons that seemed to imply that with one simple phrase from mom or dad, kids would stop fighting and get along.  I also found the constant description of the workshop to be distracting and contrived, like the authors were unable to put together a book that answered all of the necessary questions about their methods without having these disembodied voices posing the necessary questions.  In creating these voices, too, it seemed it was always the disgruntled man who opposed and questioned everything these enlightened women had to say.  The whole writing style struck me as unprofessional.    Overall, this book was decent for skimming, and it left me with a couple of ideas to ponder, but it didn't succeed in dramatically changing my parenting style, and I don't feel like it will end the sibling rivalry in our household.  My search for peace continues.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Kenneth Branagh has created a new and fascinating Hamlet.  This highly stylized version of the Dane is spellbinding.  I have seen many actors in this role, but none portrayed him in in such an original way.  The supporting cast boasts cameo performances by celebrated actors such as Robin Williams and Jack Lemmon.  This is Shakespeare at his best.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Martin Scorsese made a surprising choice when he agreed to film \\"The Departed,\\" because it is a very loyal remake of the Hong Kong 2002 demi-classic, \\"Infernal Affairs.\\"  Scorsese has gone the remake-route before with 1991's \\"Cape Fear,\\" but he has largely made his mark as one of cinema's most original directors.      The question of any remake is whether it can be separated from the original.  \\"The Departed\\" succeeds on that score, not by reinventing the plot, but by reimagining the characters.  While the broad outline remains the same, the characters who inhabit \\"The Departed\\" are very different from those who populate \\"Infernal Affairs,\\" and that's all to the good.  The fact that Scorsese was able to line up a stellar cast of Jack Nicholoson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Mark Walberg, Ray Winstone, and Vera Farmiga (along with a solid supporting cast) ensures that William Monahan's screenplay is never dull.    The plot is well-known.  Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is Boston's south-side crime lord - a mix of Tony Montana, Melvin Udall and Larry Flynt.  (Jack, God bless him, is actually a bit of a distraction because he never disappears into Costello.)  He finds a trusted laddie at a young impressionable age and grooms him to become a stellar young player in the Boston police department (Matt Damon).  This way, Costello can stay one step ahead of the Boston cops trying to nail him (Baldwin, Sheen, and Walberg all shine in their brief roles as cops, particularly Walberg).    But the cops aren't stupid.  They know that they can't bring down Costello by conventional means.  So they find their own young cadet (DiCaprio) - intelligent, but running away from a family who has long connections with Boston crime.  They arrest him and put him in jail for several months, and when he emerges, he inserts himself into Costello's crew.  Eventually, DiCaprio and Damon are charged with finding the mole in Costello's and the cop's operations - they are essentially ordered to find themselves.    What could have been played for nothing more than slick, cool operations becomes a soul-wrenching march toward fate.  Both Damon and DiCaprio give solid performances as the pressure of living dual lives wears away at their identity.  How can you be happy if you strive for success in your world, but the world you live in is the very thing you are trying to destroy?  Damon is glad-handed by cops he is undermining, or worse.  DiCaprio is trusted by the same men he is trying to put into prison and who will kill him if they even suspect he has one toe out of line.    A violent, macho movie, \\"The Departed\\" is widely recognized as one of Scorsese's better films, but definitely not one of his best.  So it will always have a bit of notoriety as the movie that won Scorsese's first Oscar - but Hollywood has a long tradition of rewarding second-class work as payback for earlier snubs.  After all, Russell Crowe won Best Actor for Maximus in \\"Gladiator\\" but was not honored for his other stellar work in \\"The Insider,\\" \\"Master and Commander,\\" etc.      If you can separate \\"The Departed\\" from its \\"Best Picture\\" status, it is an enjoyable film.  If you have recently seen \\"Infernal Affairs,\\" you will recognize the basic plot instantly, but you can still savor the performances by one of the best testosterone-heavy casts recently assembled.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This true story has a way of warming the heart. It starts out rather slow, but after the jist of the story has unfolded, you can't help but become deeply involved.  Its in the same league with classics, such as \\"Inside Moves\\" and \\"Its a wonderful Life\\".
0525476881|4.0|Colin Singleton is a self-professed prodigy. He can anagram the heck out of any word combination (except a few un-anagramabble words), and he was once on a show called Kranial Kidz. He's the type of character one would call book smart but not very street smart. Colin's one big bummer in life is that he has been dumped by a procession of 19 Katherines. So he walks around looking for the next Katherine, although he is sure Katherine 19 is THE one.<br /><br />When we first meet Colin, he has just been dumped by Ms. 19. His best friend, Hassan, decides to hornswaggle Colin into a summer road trip, meant to shake him out of his doldrums. They don't get too far. The boys find their nesting place in Gutshot, Tennessee, home to a factory where tampon strings are created. They meet the owner of the factory, Hollis, and her daughter, Lindsey. Isn't that just the most beautiful name ever? Why you would want a Katherine when you could have a Lindsey, I'll never understand.<br /><br />Hollis decides to hire the boys for a unique summer job: to interview the residents of the town/employees of the tampon string factory, for which she will pay them the sum of $500 a week, plus room and board. On top of that, Colin has his own project: to create a mathematical formula that predicts when someone will get dumped, specifically, himself.<br /><br />This is the first young adult math concept book I have ever seen. There may be other books where math is used, but not to this same extent. In fact, at the end of the book, John Green (the author) has his math buddy explain the formulas.<br /><br />Green also makes really good use of footnotes. Footnotes are something I remember only seeing in works like Shakespeare, Grendel, and the Canterbury Tales. Maybe this will spawn a whole new generation of footnote readers.<br /><br />My big thing in books is I have to feel a strong connection with the characters, and I have to cry at least once. (I did shed some tear, by the way). Well, I did like some of the characters. I didn't particularly like Colin. All he seemed to do was whine about getting dumped. I found that boring. Now, his best friend Hassan was infinitely likable. Hassan is an overweight Muslim with a quick wit and a huge heart. I feel like Hassan saved the show on the character plethora.<br /><br />Coming second to Hassan was the character of Lindsey and the residents of Gutshot. They all seemed to be very down home, lovable people. Everyone knew everyone else and they loved their town. I felt very cozy towards the townsfolk. I just wish I could have liked Colin better. Has anyone ever seen John Cusack in the movie High Fidelity? Now he was a likable/lovable dumpee. Sure, he whined, but he also had clever things to say. His witty banter with Jack Black and Todd Louiso was a highlight for me.<br /><br />I still think it's worth a read, and a lot of people must, since this book took a Printz Honor.didn't particularly like Colin.

I also made the same mistake in the past to go watch a follow-up and compared it to the previous releases that was released and would end up disappointed.    All I can say is watch the movie as if this is the first Spiderman that has been released without thinking back to how good or how Spiderman 2 was the best thing that ever could happen to converting comic book to a movie.    This movie is absolutely brilliant!!!!!!!!!!! You have to get this for your DVD collection...
B000P0I4O4|5.0|I love this movie. John Cusack's character could have been developed a bit more but other than that it is a great thriller/drama. There is a nude scene and language that keeps it from being a family film.<br /><br />By the end of this movie, the assasin as definitely met his match!
B000060MMI|5.0|The Clancy Brothers, The Irish Rovers, The Dubliners, The Chieftains and The Coors have all drawn on and contributed to the music of Ireland. Their contributions have produced an electric lively interesting sound. Flogging Molly is building on this heritage and expanding it. They have a sound that is a combination of Irish music and punk rock that is attracting and beguiling. My introduction was a ring tone on my son's phone, they will appeal to any student of Irish music. This is my second Flogging Molly CD and will not be my last.  This CD can be a good introduction or an excellent addition to your CD collection.  The title song, Drunken Lullabies, is a very strong introduction and sets the tone for a the selection of songs.  What's Left of the Flag, If I Ever Leave This World Alive and The Kilburn High Road appeal to me and get played often.

1932100660|5.0|Have you ever read a book and felt like standing on a soapbox to tell everyone? This book does that for me. I purchased several other copies to give to family and friends. Please read and share the information. If you don't have time to read this book-- bottom line: increase your intake of whole foods and plant-based proteins. Reduce greatly or completely avoid meats and dairy. Your body will thank you. Your loved ones will appreciate you being a healthier you.    The honest, truthful information in this book will blow you away. Hat's off to Campbell for exposing the government, industry and even universities in holding back and ignoring information.    If you or a loved one has an illness, disease or cancer, and is serious about optimal nutrition to let the body heal, then read on.     I also recommend the book The Thrive Diet. Based on an Ironman athlete's 15+ year search for the optimal vegan (often raw) diet. An excellent read with many recipes. And if you're super serious about what you eat, Dr. Cousens's book Conscious Eating is a wealth of information that can transcend your spiritual connection to eating healthy.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Oh why, oh why, did the networks not continue this brilliantly written and acted show after Season 3? This show is a must for any teacher, middle and highschool student. It is fun, extremely witty, sad, poignant, classy, exciting, thought provoking and gutsy. This series will always be a favourite of mine. I have to say my 10 year son loves this show, not sure if the attraction is Kristen Bell or the show itself!  Highly recommended. If you have never seen it give it a go even though it only runs for three seasons, it is worth every minute.

B000002LMK|5.0|Not only is this my favorite Neil Young album, it's one of my top favorites albums PERIOD.  In other words, I really dig this album.  Neil was the original grunge guy, outdoing them on this album and making bands like Pearl Jam look like amateurs (Neil later did an album with Pearl Jam called Mirror Ball, and its PJ's best album, along with Ten).  I love the extended jams here, especially Over and Over, and Love and Only Love (running a wonderful noisy 10:18).  You get the feeling that Young is enjoying the hell out of himself, and his attitude [...].  I never grow tired of this album.  Even though I've heard it many times, the solos still sound fresh every time.  Neil is one of the few rock artists (like Dylan and Morrison) that has managed to make great music for decades.  There were times that all 3 of them made some crap (mostly in the 80's), but they all recovered wonderfully.  A great, great, great album.

It was love at first sight, that's for sure. That was also the precise occasion when I had the inestimable privilege to know such remarkable actors: Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. And it all happened back in 1997/8, and now I've finally got this extremely well-made movie at home to watch and share with friends, relatives and students whenever I feel like.   Thank you BBC for having produced such a masterpiece, and thank you Amazon for proving me with the possibility of buying this product.
B000026FOA|5.0|This is my favorite Nick Drake album, even though all 4 (the 3 he released in his life, and Time of No Reply, an album of outtakes) are perfect.  This album has some of his most elegant songs, with my personal favorites Time Has Told Me and River Man.  One can look at Drake in many ways.  He made only 3 albums in his lifetime, they were hardly known during his life, and he ended up overdosing and dying quietly.  Yet, today, this man's work is more alive than ever, with people discovering his melancholy and brilliance.  Many performers spend their whole lives releasing albums, TV shows, films, poetry, books, and never reach anyone other than on a superficial level at best.  Nick put out 3 albums, and touched the soul of thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, and maybe someday millions.  It's something to think about for budding artists.  What do you want to be remembered for?  Some silly catch phrase, a star in a trashy sitcom or overblown TV drama, being a coked out celebrity, a musician who puts out a few hit albums then indulges in endless nostalghia tours, a professional celebrity who likes to appear on talk shows to do countless interviews and occasionally does film/TV roles just to keep the bank account full, or for a really, truly artistic work that will reach people for generations?  The latter isn't an easy road, but it's the only true road that you can take if you want to create something significant.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|Now I must first say that going into this movie I had an open mind; I knew it wouldn't be like classic Bond movies of the past and was ready for a new experience. Unfortunately, Martin Campbell (Director) lost me from the first scene and from that point it was a continuous struggle to figure out what the hell was going on...Above all, the plot was incredibly weak. The fact that Texas Hold'Em Poker made it into the newest Bond movie is disturbing and hints that our society is full of a bunch of imbeciles. Let's be honest, this movie didn't target the aristocracy of our fine country. I am just mildly disappointed that the writers decided to cater to the average American. How many more movies need to be made for \\"The Others\\" (average Americans). They already have Turistas to watch, why do they need to now ruin the Bond series so that ignorant people can watch the movie. On a sidenote, when I saw the movie in theatres, the LCD (Lowest Common Denominator - of people) didn't even watch the movie. They were simply too busy discussing hoop earings, Daddy Yankee, and I even saw one LCD attempting to do tha Soulja Boy in the middle of the theatre. I am now uncertain as to whether I can ever return to the theatre again...It is going to be alright though, they will work for me one day!
B00000055D|5.0|Back in the late 90's 2Pac was on constant rotation in my world and this album along with all eyez on me and makaveli was all that I listened to when it comes to hip hop. 2 pac is without a doubt one of the greatest hip hop artists ever. This is my 3rd favorite album of his. Sure being 2 discs worth of music this has some filler and perhaps skippable songs unlike his amazing classic all eyez on me. On the other hand some of my most favorite pac songs ever are on this collection and this has sentimental value hence the 5 star rating. I dont think its worthy of the label classic because of the filler songs maybe 4.5 would be a better rating but its Pac and I cant give anything less than 5 stars. If you were into pac because of all eyez on me or me against the world or makaveli check this album out for sure. Take all the best songs of this double disc set and make one album and its possible it could top any of his classics. Dont sleep!

B000024D4R|5.0|This is my favorite Floyd album, and it's probably the most challenging and prog rock like.  There rages a debate across the net and the like about whether Pink is a prog band.  With this album, they come close.  There are a mere 4 songs on this album, but aside from Pigs on the Wing (a cute little ditty that opens and closes the album), they are all extended tracks.  They don't feel like jamming, they feel like every note is supposed to be there.  This album contains some of Waters's best and most bitter lyrics.  The lyrics on Dogs are probably the most bleak, but Pigs and Sheep give it a run for their money.  Gilmour really shines on Dogs, singing and contributing great guitar solos.  There is a \\"Whitehouse\\" reference in Pigs, which many have mistaken for the American White House.  This isn't true.  It's a crack against Mary Whitehouse, a Tipper Gore like censor who reaked havoc over the film/music/TV industry in the 1970's and 1980's.  Despite this, it's fun to pretend sometimes that it's against the White House.  This is the album where Waters began dominating the band more and more, but it's still Floydian and has great contributions from Gilmour, Mason, and Wright.  This album is quite profound at times (especially Sheep), and it's amazing that it was released by a major label.  Granted, Floyd was at the top of their game in 1977, so they could get away with it, but it's hard to imagine a label (even an indie one) releasing something as artistic and as challenging as this.  This is Floyd's best.

0345494997|5.0|In Loving Frank, Nancy Horan has pieced together an entire saga from news clippings, letters, and folklore surrounding Chicago and related sites. She transliterated it into believability in a woman of independent thought, ala Jane Austen, and the famous and infamous Frank Lloyd Wright. The intellectual Mamah Borthwick was reluctant wife to a Wright client, Edwin Cheney, who literally threw the thinking feminist and the genius architect together and wondered why an affair occurred.    Horan's transliteration of history and rumor into life jumping from the page follows passages on pages 9 -101. In one scene, Mameh describes living translations:    \\"Well, it's a little bit of alchemy, I think. It helps enormously to understand the culture you're translating from, and then the one you're taking it into.\\"    There are concepts in many languages that are nonexistent in others. Transliteration is a sort of language profiling that lifts concepts into a second language in a way to describe un-contemplated ideas understandably to a new audience. It is not simply translating dead-on, word for literal word, to arrive at mechanical structures devoid of emotion, nuance, and layers of meaning. It is not \\"The Mississippi River is historical, wide and dirty,\\" but rather, \\"That Old Man River, he just keeps rolling along.\\"    Horan achieved alchemy with her Mameh and Frank. They are real people. While both were publicly disparaged for \\"thinking\\" in new ways in the late 18th - early 19th centuries, they were also condemned out of envy. People working to transcend a mediocre life are often attacked by the community-whether it is Mamah and Frank, or an urban young adult studying determinedly to achieve a GED certificate.    People did not often marry for love or faith-based foundations in past American centuries. They married to join \\"good families,\\" produce heirs, and have children to work on the family farm. For Mameh and Frank, finding a soul mate led to adultery and disaster.    Mamah should have held out and not married the near-stalker Edwin, as Jane Austen did not marry at all.    Armchair Interviews says: Everyone from high school to adult could enjoy Loving Frank.
0316666343|2.0|I had heard great things about this book so decided to read it.  I agree with a lot of the other reviews that say it started out really great and then fizzled out.  I think the storyline was all over the place, and I couldn't understand what the point was, other than just to be a fly on the wall in the lives of Susie's family.  I was also not happy with the bodily possession (a bit much in my opinion) or the weak ending.  I think the concept was interesting, and I think I would have liked it better if it kept the same energy it had in the beginning.  I did enjoy the fact that it was based in the Philadelphia suburbs, as I am familiar with that area.

B000QQFKYE|1.0|This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my life. We had a chance to see it with my wife during the premiere screening in Europe. The viewers at such events, who are usually fond of ambitious movies were leaving in such numbers that we were afraid that no one would survive till the end.
1401301010|5.0|This is a fantastic read, and is very well written. Some very cool photos and lyrics are included.  I spent the extra money to buy a hardcover version which is a good choice.  The drug addiction and honesty that Anthony brings to that disease is worth the read alone.  It is awesome he has found a way to deal with his addiction and keep writing and performing at an exceptional level.
0385040253|5.0|I do decorative knotting and collect knotting books. This should have been one of my first purchases. This book has amazing historical and useage information as well as excellent drawings. The 620 pages are almost totally covered with how-to drawings and explanations of the knots. All the knots are numbered. When a new knot is introduced that is similar to a previous one, it references that number. Some of the names of knots are not what I've seen in other books, but I don't see that as a problem. If I could only buy one knot book, this would be it.

0595440096|5.0|I started STILL ALICE last evening and could not put it down. Lisa Genova entices the reader into the Protean world of Alzheimer's. STILL ALICE is the story of a dreadful (and dreaded) disease which daily diminishes its victim, Alice, and continually challenges her circle of friends and family. Lisa Genova's silk soft words and gentle unfolding of characters spin a compelling tale. Her well-researched and superbly crafted novel offers scientific and philosophical perspective. But most of all, it offers comfort. It will make a positive difference in the lives of many people.

All of Bob Marleys albums are worth owning, but if your new to Bob, then this cd will help you get into his music, as Legend is a great starting point. Peep the songs \\"Is This Love\\", \\"No Woman No Cry\\", \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\", and \\" Jamming\\". These are all great songs, and they showcase Bob Marleys many creative sides. Purchase, and enjoy the Legend of Bob Marley.
B00005JPQL|5.0|Back in 19th century England, there was a village called Wall which sat on the border between mundane England and magical Stormhold.  One night, Drustan takes a trip across and has an encounter with a young witch's servant in the marketplace.  Nine months later, he's left with a son, Tristan.    Eighteen years after that, Tristan falls in love with a shallow young beauty named Victoria, who will declare her love for him if he catches the falling star they see in the night sky and brings it back to him.     The problem is--that star lands on the other side of the wall and the embodiment of that star is the fulfillment of not just Tristan's dreams, but the immortality of three witches, and the sovereignty of Stormhold.     \\"Stardust\\" is a beautifully cast and filmed movie that the whole family can enjoy for many years to come.  This is one I will want to add to my collection in DVD because I foresee wanting to watch it every year or so.     If you are like me a reader of Gaiman and have hesitated to see this film, \\"Stardust\\" is one of the rare instances where a book's been translated into a movie and the adaptation has made it better.  The few changes made definitely enriched the story and gave us a better ending.
B000002H97|4.0|Now alot of people seem to think that with this album Metallica sold out. Anyway, the way I see it, is that they were just trying to broaden their fan base. Which I believe they did a great job at, because after the release of this album, their popularity in the mainstream was a great sucess. I will agree though, that it's definatly not their best effort, though they did however, show off their best song-writing capabilities in my opinion. So even if it's no Master Of Puppets, or Ride the Lightning, it's definatly a masterpiece worth owning and adding to your collection. Forget the hate & sellout talk, and buy this album. Support the original sounds of metal, before it's too late, and this Nu-Metal/ Death Metal takes over. Enjoy!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This film expertly illustrates what it was like in 1980s East Germany, when many citizens' homes were under constant surveillance for any hint of sedition or suspicious activity.  Arousing too much suspicion brought a visit from the Stasi and months of interrogation and imprisonment, often followed by despair and suicide.    We follow the lives of a small group of writers and actors as they try to produce plays that someone might disapprove of.  What's more interesting is that one of the Stasi monitors is sympathetic to these artists and ends up protecting them at his own professional expense.    An especially frightening thought:  with illegal wiretapping and surveillance, we run the risk of ending up in exactly this sort of society, under the guise of \\"security\\" and \\"protection.\\"

B000002JOH|5.0|Not much explaining is needed, after all this review is for Pantera. And we all know how great of a band they are, and anything I have to say, i'm sure has been said already. This cd just plain rocks. It's non-stop punch after punch, of hardcore guitar riffs, and heavy beating drums pounding out your eardrums. Not to mention it's the heaviest metal album to ever debut at number 1 on the charts. Phil Anselmo is just plain awsome, his vocal talents are amazing, and they make you take listen on every song, while Dimebag Darrell shreads the bass to pieces with such vivid & hardcore notes, and Vinnie Paul beats the living hell out of the drums, together drawing attention everywhere. Pantera truly is a great band, and I recommend this cd to any metal fans, along with the rest of Pantera's catalog, especially \\"Cowboy's From Hell\\" & \\"Far Beyond Driven\\". 5 Stars!
0618680004|3.0|Because he characterizes religion as intolerant, Dawkins will not tolerate it.  Religion should be prevented from being taught to children by their parents.  (Pgs. 325-327.)  How this would be implemented is not specified.  (But it would probably require an extensive amount of formal societal intolerance.)<br /><br />Humanity's conception of science must explain all existence.  Because there is currently no coherent scientific paradigm for God, God must not exist.  Having defined God as nonexistent, Dawkins identifies religion as absurd.  However, by \\"religion,\\" he primarily focuses on Christianity, Judiasm, and Islam.<br /><br />This seemed like a book-length rant.  However, Dawkins writes in an entertaining wry style which is enjoyable to read.  Whatever your ideological persuasion, this book will convince you of the futility of trying to \\"argue\\" someone into belief in anything (particularly religion).  Dawkins does a very good job of covering all the back and forth argumentation between deists and atheists.  They are talking past one another.  They could save their breath, because insight must develop from within.<br /><br />The topic of what happens to consciousness after death is little addressed here.  This is the fundamental divide between science and religion.  If atheists are content with the prospect of personal dissolution, many others are not.  Thus the meme of religious thought, which purports to reveal the nature of postmortem existence, will always persist.<br /><br />A side note - on pg. 73, Dawkins writes: \\"science fiction authors, such as Daniel F. Galouye in COUNTERFEIT WORLD, have even (and I can't think how to disprove it) said that we live in a computer simulation, set up by some vastly superior civilization.\\"<br /><br />If we substitute \\"God\\" for \\"vastly superior civilization\\" and \\"creation\\" for \\"computer simulation,\\" how would this be different from the claims of the Bible?  If Dawkins can't think how to disprove such a possibility, what is the basis for determining that such a God does not exist?  We would have no basis for judging such a \\"creator,\\" existing entirely outside our \\"computer simulation\\" - all our scientific laws would be part of the simulation.  We would only know what the \\"creator\\" (or vastly superior civilization, if you prefer) has revealed to us about itself/themselves, even if the revelations may seem to conflict with what we can determine about our \\"reality\\" based on our observations from within the simulation.  We would then have two sets of knowledge - one mediated by our own senses and observation, and one mediated by revelation from the vastly superior civilization/creator, who would be able to transcend/supersede the scientific \\"laws\\" of the simulation at will.  And both would be right.  Just food for thought...od does not exist?

B000J103X4|4.0|Though The Game left 50's record label he is still on Interscope records via Geffen, so as far as the beef being real or fake I don't know, and could really care less. When you listen to music, you listen to the music and enjoy it if you like it, instead of base it off of constant beef between 2 emcees/rappers. Anyway, on to my review. The Game may not have the presence of Dr. Dre, the toughness of Xzibit, the character of Kurupt, or the charisma of the late great 2pac, but he has a voice that stands out, and you know it's him when you hear it. Though I believe he does better on his featured appearances on other peoples albums, I feel he does a decent job on his own as well. This album is just plain good ol' westcoast hip-hop, and The Game makes you feel like a part of the West, even if your not from there. Some tracks to listen to are \\"It's Okay (One Blood)\\", \\"Compton\\", \\"Scream On 'Em\\", and \\"Why You Hate The Game\\". Great cd, with excellent production by, Just Blaze, Will.I.Am, Kanye West, Scott Storch, etc. And even with the absence of Dr. Dre & 50-Cent, he still managed to sell records, and make a great masterpiece for our ears. Recommended must buy!
B0000009SE|4.0|I'm not a Zappa-o'phile but this album is a gem. \\"Big Swifty\\" and \\"Waka/Jawaka\\" are some of the finest jazz fusion you will ever hear. You are listening to Zappa in his prime. Not everything Zappa has done is this good. Much of FZ's material is a little too silly for me as he learned to play up the bizzare to sell albums. Waka/Jawaka is as good as Hot Rats or Grand Wazoo. Jazz From Hell is another very challenging FZ album that I recommend. I had always hoped that Zappa would focus more on improvisional jazz fusion rather than the goofy and the gross. Zappa was a HUGE talent that got too caught up in anti-establishment baiting.
B00070DK5K|5.0|Sorry...I LOVE this album, and after bootlegging...\\"many\\" tracks off the late great Napster, I'm now gonna buy the \\"new refurbished, etc...\\"  Why?  And \\"why\\" the title to this review?  OK 1), my glorious band in NY, circa '75-'76, always opened our sets with a \\"Diamond Dogs-Rebel Rebel-Moonage Daydream\\" medley, in their entirity, and, note-for-note, ripped straight off \\"David Live.\\"  And yes, I HAVE gone on record as saying that Mick Ronson, Bowie's \\"Ziggy's\\" ex, SHOULD Have received the job that one R Wood received in '75 - but Earl Slick (in ADDITION to being married - at the time - to one of the absolute HOTTEST Babes EVER, Fanny's Jean Millington), himself was/is hot as a jumper cable at a redneck funeral.  (and, yeah, when Ronno defected from Ian H in 1977, Ian scooped up Slick for what I consider his finest work, the glimmering \\"Overnight Angels.\\") And 2) right after this, Bowie started purveying disco, then ran into the arms of Rob't Fripp...give me a freaking break...(but \\"Ashes To Ashes\\" WAS a good song...)  Enough.  Bowie: 1974: Earl Slick, David Sanborn, et al... like Lous Armstrong said, \\"If ya gotta ask, you'll never know.\\"

B000TSIK14|3.0|As a long time Scorps fan, I was eager for the follow-up to Unbreakable, which I thought was the best album they'd put out since Savage Amusement and one that rivaled any from the 80's.  In my opinion, while this album isn't on the whole \\"bad\\", it doesn't entirely hold up.  I found myself placing songs into one of three categories:    SONGS I LIKE:     Hour 1:  solid riff oriented song; very good opener to the album    We Will Rise Again:  a song to rival the opening track.  Interesting composition and arrangement.      Your Last Song:  A more mellow track, but not a \\"ballad\\" in the traditional sense.  More importantly to me, it sounds not only good, but a tad bit original.     The Cross:  Excellent main riff, great contrasting guitar lines in the verses.  Strong song.      Humanity:  The song begins in a way that reminds me of their 70's era material, while the verses take me to the 80's, and the choruses have that 21st century \\"Unbreakable\\" feel.  Very good song.      SONGS I COULD IGNORE, or MAY HAVE TO GROW ON ME:    The Game of Life:  harmonics in the verses remind me of \\"In Your Park\\" from Virgin Killer, which is very nice.  Other than that, I'm not sure.     We Were Born to Fly:  decent song, in the vein as the previous track    Love is War:  listenable, like other tracks on the album but nothing that strikes my fancy.      Cold: This is the Best Buy bonus track.  It's decent, better than many on the album but not outstanding.   That being said, it IS worth having.     SONGS THAT EITHER SUCK OR CONTAIN MOMENTS TOO LAME TO OVERLOOK:    The Future Never Dies:  \\"I'm lost in your eyes\\" - lame, cliché lyric.  The piano in the verses is a tired 80's pattern that reminds me of \\"Home Sweet Home\\", and that's not good.  The best thing I can say about this song is that it's better than most of its ilk.      You're Lovin' Me to Death:   cheese city - nothing special    321:  great meaty opening riff but falls flat from there.  \\"baby 321 are you ready to rock\\"?  That's just dumb.    Love Will Keep Us Alive:  It seems like I've heard this before, and didn't like it.  Cheesy.  Not a bad song per se, just not very interesting or original.      On the whole:    I'd rather have this than no new Scorpions album, for sure.  However, I don't think this is a \\"masterpiece\\" as some have claimed.      Update:  After giving this album much time and consideration I've come to conclude that it's worse than I had originally thought.  I stand by the content of my review, but it's proven to be an album that is forgettable, with a few decent tracks, at best.  2 stars.
1594489505|5.0|The book is written in such a way as to educate those of us aware but still ignorant of the struggles in the Middle East.  By using fictional characters in a historic formant this book teaches as well as entertains.  I was left with a much better understanding of the limitations of women, and the basic struggle just to survive which is the everyday life of the Afghan.  I consider myself fairly knowledgeable and I felt dumb when I closed the book on the final page.
0440539811|5.0|This book is 800+ pages of a practical joke.  It is very entertaining and well worth reading.  It kept my attention throughout the story and I found myself laughing at the absurdities as well as the 'wink winks'.  Beyond that I would hope that people are intelligent and patient enough with the book to realize that it is a work of fiction, and that while there may be an iota of truth in every fifty pages, it is just a maybe.  Be sure to read after the story is completed, and you won't be disappointed.  However if you're looking for a convenient linear storyline you definitely will be.  One last note, this book has made me research more historical archives than any history class, any thing in life which makes you think is a great thing to experience.
0743454537|4.0|I totally agree with the reader who said that the ending of this book was disappointing. The entire book up to that point was engrossing, emotional, involving...I couldn't put it down, even though I thought some of the characters (Jesse especially) were caricaturist and clichéd. It seems the end was totally contrived to give some kind of \\"twist\\" and moral to the story...it did not fit well with the rest of the book at all.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is quite possibly the best crime show I've ever seen. It's truly in a class all it's own. I'm also into shows like The Wire, The Shield, and The Sopranos, but this is a different breed of crime drama altogether. I don't believe I've ever been as excited to start a new episode as I've been watching this. Enough of that crap though, let's get on to why it's so great.<br /><br />Dexter is a sociopath who does not feel emotion and does not know how to connect with people. All emotions he appears to have in public are fake (an act). He channels his homicidal urges in a direction that only preys on people who deserve to die slow painful deaths. He's no vigilante though; rather he is quite a monster. He only kills evil people because he was trained to do so in order to survive. Since he was a small boy he's had urges to kill. For the sake of not spoiling anything I won't go into any details, just know that this is one creepy, original show.<br /><br />I've been into collecting HBO shows on DVD for a while (Dexter is on Showtime), and the quality of this show is right up there. Showtime is really stepping up and giving HBO a run for it's money. The DVD release leaves something to be desired though. For a show this good, the extras should be better. Most of the extras are ads for other Showtime series like Brotherhood and The Tudors. They're great shows too, but I'd much rather them focus on Dexter (looks like they're desperate for new subscribers).  The packaging could be cooler, and the DVD menus could be better looking. Of course that is just nit picking, and all that would probably drive the cost up. In actuality, this set is a bargain at 30 bucks. HBO might have more elaborate DVD packages, but they can also cost three times as much.<br /><br />If you're thinking about seeing this show, think no longer. Stop whatever you're doing, drive over to the nearest DVD retailer, and buy it. One of the best TV shows ever, no joke. If you'd like to review my taste in TV shows, look at my \\"Best of TV on DVD\\" list to get a feel for the level of quality I enjoy (and expect). You might find that you have similar tastes which should confirm if you'd like Dexter.ws, look at my \\"Best of TV on DVD\\" list to get a feel for the level of quality I enjoy (and expect).

B000TSIK14|5.0|Easily the Scorpions best album since CRAZY WORLD, HUMANITY HOUR 1 is a triumph of soul-searching hard rock.  A concept album loosely constructed around a vision of the future in which humans and androids battle for control of the Earth, HUMANITY HOUR 1 is a total departure from the band's most recent releases (EYE II EYE, UNBREAKABLE) and far more powerful because of it.  As a concept album, the album doesn't necessarily tell a coherent story, and the individual songs generally don't rely on the concept for their artistic merit, but the thematic backdrop of man fighting for survival against his own creations does provide a strong focus for the Scorpions to delve into the human psyche and explore the mortal realm of love, desire, disillusionment, and the cost of survival in a world gone mad.  I was a little dubious about the influence of Desmond Child on the album, but the band makes it work and the result is a cd no other heavy metal group in the world could've pulled off.  As for the individual tracks themselves...    1.  \\"Hour 1\\": A dark and stormy introduction to the chaos.  4 1/2 stars  2.  \\"The Game of Life\\": Scorps have always been good at rockers designed to challenge and inspire their fans to rise to new heights, but this one's darker than most.  5 stars  3.  \\"We Were Born to Fly\\": The power of love to take us out of even the darkest storm.  4 stars  4.  \\"The Future Never Dies\\": For good or bad, there's always another day. 3 1/2 stars  5.  \\"You're Lovin' Me to Death\\":  More of a traditional rocker's love song.  3 stars  6.  \\"321\\":  This one's for the head-banger's out there...an underlying desperation makes this hard-rocker more than it seems...would probably play best in an arena where it could rock the house.  4 1/2 stars  7.  \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\":  Possibly the weakest song on the album, though still not bad.  3 Stars   8.  \\"We Will Rise Again\\":  An instant Scorpions classic.  Captures the sturm & angst of souls caught up in forbidden love with power and operatic majesty. 5+ stars  9.  \\"Your Last Song\\":  Bittersweet ode to good love gone bad.  3 1/2 stars  10. \\"Love is War\\":  A once star-crossed man learns the rules of love the hard way, and he'll never be the same.  4 stars  11.  \\"The Cross\\":  The Bible says we must all take up our cross, and for the betrayed young man in this song that cross is love itself.  A song of righteous despair, and like \\"We Will Rise Again\\" one of the best Scropions have ever done.  5+ stars  12.  \\"Humanity\\":  The final coda to the cd's overall vision, at once an existential nightmare and a heartfelt plea for every man to stand up for the humanity in himself.  5 stars    Unfortunately, Scorpions have fallen so far out of the mainstream consciousness in American rock that it's unlikely HUMANITY HOUR 1 will be appreciated by any outside the band's loyal fanbase.  Most of these tracks probably won't get much playing time in the States, though hopefully in Europe they'll get more exposure.  The album is undeniably heavy on ballads--at which Scorpions have always excelled--and straightforward heavy metal rockers may not find what they're looking for here, except in \\"321\\" which is something of a throwback to \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\".  But however many copies it sells, HUMANITY HOUR 1 is a hard rock masterpiece, and longtime Scorpions fans--members of that \\"Family of Spiders\\"--will embrace this album for the classic that it is.  Highest Possible Recommendation.
185984054X|1.0|You cann be an atheist, and you can hate the Catholic Church, but it is hard to deny that Mother Teresa on balance did far more good for the world than she did evil and I'd imagine far more good than most of us.  Hutchinson seems to imply that she received millions of dollars in aid and yet she didn't provide a high level of aid to the poor of Calcutta.  Thi simplies that she was living the high life in luxury - nothing could be further than the truth read her journals for a clear picture of teh kind of life she leads.    Go ahead and hate god, that's your choice and you'll be held to account, but on the facts admit the Mother Teresa was a saintly woman.
075640407X|5.0|I just finished what I think will probably be my favorite book of the year, The Name of the Wind, The KingKiller Chronicle: Day One by Patrick Rothfuss. This is his first book and I think we have a new star on the rise.<br /><br />The story revolves around Kvothe (pronounced similiar to \\"quothe\\") a man of great power and legend. It is actually a story within a story. It moves from third person narration to first person when Kvothe is telling his story to a scribe. This makes for an entertaining read as the third person narration acts as a type of \\"interlude\\" between the story of Kvothe's adventures.<br /><br />The trilogy is actually made up of three days of Kvothe telling his story to the famous \\"Chronicler\\", thus the \\"Day One\\" in the title. The story almost seems to be therapeutic to Kvothe as he comes to terms with who he is and the legend he created. There are moments where Kvothe comes \\"alive\\" when telling his tale and moments where he seems \\"darker\\".<br /><br />The story never drags and the pacing is impeccable. As I mentioned the book moves between third person, when Kvothe is talking and interacting with the scribe, and first person, when Kvothe is actually telling his story. The transitions are seemless and make great spots to help build the suspense of the book.<br /><br />Mr. Rothfuss does a fantastic job with character development, which I think is what makes this book so great.  You can actually \\"see\\" and \\"feel\\" Kvothe, Denna, and the rest of the cast.  I begin to get inside Kvothe and see what drives him and how and why he reacts to situations.<br /><br />I give this book five stars and I am anxiously waiting the next installment that is due out in April 2008.  If you are looking for something new in the fantasy realm, then look no further.  Read this book.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|At first I was with the people who gave this album 1 or 2 stars and thought \\"What in God's name is this?\\". In fact, my favorite song was \\"Era Vulgaris\\", a song featuring Trent Reznor of NIN fame which didn't even make the album. Look it up. However, being a monster Queens fan I couldn't give up that easily, and pretty much just played it whenever I was at work or doing other stuff which wouldn't require my attention much. After not long I was singing the entire album and fully rockin' out. \\"Turning on the Screw\\" has become a monster jam in my daily playlist. Check it.

B000O1799U|3.0|I'm usually not one who much enjoys musicals; as result, I waited a while before seeing Dreamgirls. And I have to admit, this film was a pleasant surprise! I must say, Fantasia must be one hell of a vocalist if she beat out Jennifer Hudson to win American Idol because Hudson's performance was huge. It's safe to say, \\"A star was born.\\" And apparently, there was a since of reciprocity attached to this role because Jennifer Hudson thumped Fantasia to win the role of Effie and the rest as they is history. She became the first African American woman to win an Academy Award (Best Supporting Actress) in her debut appearance (not that race is an issue). Eddie Murphy also turns in the best performance of his career as Jimmy Thunder. It was refreshing to finally see him in something besides an Urkel-like character. Although I did love this film, I have to give it three very strong stars because I think both Beyonce Knowles (although it was a passable performance) and Jamie Foxx were poor choices for their respective characters. I'm not sure Knowles has enough acting experience to pull off poignant performances yet, and Foxx (except for his Ray performance) simply always looks like he's on the verge of telling a joke or making a funny face. With that said, I do recommend adding this film to your library - it's a winner.
B0000024YL|5.0|This CD will never grow old.<br /><br />After all these years, I still look through my collection to find it and play it, especially when I want to mellow out, this and Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, they just never get old or collect any dust.<br /><br />Love it and recommend it !
B0000047EC|5.0|a purified and refined beauty; this is controlled technique, and takes a skilled, yet patient ear to understand how rare this sound is.
B000EXZI0A|5.0|This is a great Best Hits CD.<br /><br />Blitzkrieg Bop is charged and will send you to the dance floor. Sheena Is A Punk Rocker is also got a great rhythm and pulse to it.  Teenage Lobotomy is also fast and classic, like all the songs here. Lastly, I wanna Be Sedated is fun and fast.<br /><br />Their songs do not dwell on negativity, I think they definitly can lift your spirits and make you want to dance.<br /><br />Highly recommended !

Im a huge fan of AFI and i can call myself a \\"true\\" fan of them and most people can not because of this album. Who cares about lables you guys are going into to much details just listen to the music and stfu.<br /><br />Im a real fan because i would listen to them even if they started to rap. And on top of that i was a fan before sing the sorrow.<br /><br />And no im not emo and i think emo is the worst thing to ever survive. They have copyed the goth/metal/punk scenes and made fun of it so i will NEVER like emo music or emo people.You guys are a bunch of whinny clones that do not know anything about music.....

0141439580|4.0|Be warned: this book is slow.  very slow. i loved pride and prejudice, but i would have quit partway through this one if it hadn't been a gift.    However, if you have the patience and fortitude to get through it, you will be rewarded. Though i could have done without so much detail about the planning of a party, or full chapters of Emma and Mr. Knightley talking things to death, it was an overall good book. Emma is very fully developed.  She starts out, not as a good girl with some faults, but as a vain, selfish, silly young woman, and comes out by the end of the book deeply and believably changed.    one thing I particularly enjoyed is that since Emma was always so wrong in her guesses, it was up to the reader to figure out what was really going on, and who was in love with whom.  Especially towards the end, I had a lot of fun picking out hints and speculating, and seeing my guesses come out right.    The book isn't so amazing that i would urge everyone to struggle through the whole length of it, but it's a worthwhile and enjoyable read.  it just could have been much shortened.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|Yes, it's based off of a video game.  Yes, the plot is thin.  Were you expecting effin' Shakespeare?  This is the best video game to movie adaptation there is.  Also, one of the better zombie movies.  It's a hell of a lot better than 28 Days Later.  And, for my money, better than the remake of Dawn of the Dead.  Which was good.  This is a movie for people who want to see things shot, blown up, etc.  That's why people make/watch these.  If you expect more, then you only have yourself to blame and shouldn't trash the movie because of it.  All in all this is a great movie as well as the sequel.
B000OONQBM|4.0|One of Walter Hill's best received and most controversial films gets a new look here in the \\"Director's Cut.\\"  The biggest difference is the comic book transitions in which scenes freeze to comic book form before moving on.  The concept feels a little gimmicky and does distract early on, but once you're used to it, it accentuates some cool moments that make you smile.<br /><br />The Warriors came out admist a lot of controversy.  During the first week of release, some knuckleheads back east decided to start shooting each other in a screening, creating the type of buzz you don't see anymore.  People were warned not to go see it.  Well, the movie never lived up to that hype.  It's a fairly conventional action-thriller.  What it did live up to was entertainment value.  Even decades after its release, there are still iconic moments that register in everything from pop culture references to songs.  Yes, the film is dated.  Some of the actors and dialogue are weak (surprisingly from Hill).  But the thematic story still holds true.  The action is still entertaining.  And the bad guy, clinking his bottles to the tune of \\"War-r-r-r-riors...come out to pl-la-ay!!!\\" will always have a special place in my heart.<br /><br />HD transfer gives the film a freshness not seen in some time.  Extras are pretty scant, but at the price, this is a no-brainer to add to the library.
B000RJO57I|5.0|Highest Recommendation!  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is packed with action and laughs.  The climax will have you screaming with joy!  Do not hesitate to purchase this DVD.
156224003X|1.0|In my estimation, this is not a book for anyone who is struggling with how to develop a clear method for practicing the piano or any instrument.  In fact, book seems to be more focused upon Mr. Werner's ideological views about society than with the real issues of serious piano practice.  For instance, he spends several paragraphs discussing the downfall of society as a result of women being able to use pain killers during child birth and humans being able to eat canned peaches.  Then he makes some offhand comment about menopause.  One begins to wonder whether this man has serious issues of his own and should be therapy. The bottom line is the book is extremely redundant and is of no help.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any of my students as it would be a complete waste of their time.  This book is really nothing more than a reflection of Kenny's stream of consciousness:  a submerged mysogynistic and puritanical view of society that would have been better served if humans had not discovered the benefits of technology.     If a student really wants to become a master, then he or she should study the harmonic form of the piece and immerse oneself in the beauty of that experience.  As Webern said, \\"your ears may tell you where you're going, but you have to know why.\\"
6304711921|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the coolest films ever shot. Taking a viewer along on a trip into a dimension where each holiday has its own 365-day realm (it's Christmas all year, Halloween all year, Easter, etc.) Tim Burton's fantasy about Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King's, ill-fated but fabulous infatuation with Christmas becomes in these creative hands the most original movie made in the 1990's. Nothing wrong here, just a classic that'll reign for ages.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Once again, the creative minds behind Pixar have created enchantment ... possibly their best film in years.  Everyone loves Ratatouille...even though he is a rat in the kitchen.    Indeed, the idea of rats in an upscale restaurant would normally have us run for cover. Nevertheless, the movie successfully blends the themes of the Ugly Duckling with Cyrano de Bergerac to come up with a fantastic story.   Remy is a simple rat with an extraordinary nose.  His idol is a great French chef who lectures on the Food Channel. \\"Anyone Can Cook\\" is his mantra.  So when Remy and his rat family have to leave their homes, Remy accidentally ends up in the very kitchen of this great Chef.  Alas, the great chef has passed away, and the food standards are falling, as well as the Michelin stars.  To reverse this trend, Remy - the rat - teams up with a clueless scullery boy in the kitchen to whip up some wonderful recipes. Indeed, the rat's food creations are a hit with the customers. The problem, as in all Cyrano stories, is that no one knows who is really behind those wonderful recipes. And most important, will  the most difficult restaurant critic in Paris condemn or praise the food that Remy prepares?     Everything about this film is wonderful...the streets of Paris are recreated in rich colors and exquisite detail.  I haven't seen a European city look this good in an animated film since Disney's \\"Pinocchio.\\" Yes, it is definitely worth experiencing this delight on Blu-Ray. Oh my, even the French copper pots look authentic.     The most wonderful moment of the film is the food review given by Anton Ego - one of the \\"big\\" restaurant critics of France - of the menu prepared by the rat chefs.  And what is so memorable is how \\"poetic\\" his review is. This is a testament to the excellent care to the script writing by the Pixar team.     On another point, I laughed hysterically throughout the film...particularly the times when the rat conceals himself in a chef hat and rides the garbage boy like a cowboy on a bronco. Please don't miss this treat. Highly recommended.
B000R8YC1S|5.0|What to say about one of the most enchanting movies from my childhood? This all-time classic always suspends my disbelief to the point where even now when I settle in to enjoy my DVD of this personal favorite, some little corner of my mind accepts that I truly am watching events as they unfold within a massive labyrinth controlled by none other than the coolest of the cool, the sinister and charming Goblin King himself, David Bowie. Had Labyrinth been done a few years later than it was, it would have been computer-generated, and that would have diminished the impact of the Jim Henson characters who as puppets added just the right touch to this story of a quest by a young girl to save her baby brother, Toby, abducted from his crib at her accidental behest, ere he is transformed forever into a goblin. As teenaged Sarah, played by a strikingly beautiful Jennifer Connelly, undertakes her brave trek into the heart of the Goblin King's elaborate magical maze (the sets for Labyrinth are awe-inspiring creations) she encounters its denizens, some helpful, others mischievous, a few malign. The music of Labyrinth is also good enough in its own right to warrant mention and makes for a soundtrack that's also worth owning. (A mini review for you...) Although I own Labyrinth on VHS and purchased it on another DVD a few years ago, this anniversary release is the best of the lot, not only for its \\"time capsule\\" extra features, but also because for the first time since seeing it in theaters as a kid, Labyrinth is finally featured in a widescreen format which does it justice. A great movie, and a DVD worth owning.

0385522401|5.0|Marcia Epstein (2 reviews previously) suggests that sexual abuse is proven by her alleged reference to a belt being dropped and that this explains the girl's sexual frigidity on her wedding night...    Firstly I don't know if this is in the US edition but I did not see any such reference in the British edition and would thus suggest it is highly unlikely given mainstream American attitudes are generally more conservative in the mainstream media (but of course far more sexually explicit in Americans consumption of porn).    I therefore would suggest that this is a mistake by this reviewer.    For my part I found the book to be a very realistic and accurate portrayal of the sexual attitudes and experiences of most \\"well brought up well educated middle class people\\" in the UK, and I would venture to suggest in the US too, in the period up to say 1980.    It is a pity however that Ian McEwan didn't venture into why the couple's wedding night may have resulted in what happened and may have voluntarily decided to hold back whether out of respect for each other or for the lack of opportunities during their engagement or courtship.    It is very common for virgins to experience difficulties at their first attempt and especially so for females. At weddings too and especially big society weddings the couple are usually thoroughly exhausted what with all the social and financial arrangements of 'their' wedding day, buying a house etc etc and so such a lack of desire was common.    What however I felt was very unrealistic about the book was the female's refusal to try to overcome this common problem and to walk out of her marriage after making the public promises in vows. That reflected very badly indeed on her. It sounds like Ian McEwan knows only too well the strange mindset and psychological problems which beset upper class boarding school girls and boys...!
B000244FDW|5.0|A GREAT MOVIE I'VE WANTED FOR YEARS.  IT IS A FINE EXAMPLE AS TO THE USE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. THE DIALOGUE IS A PLEASURE TO HEAR. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD PLAY WELL IN SOME PARTS OF GREAT BRITAIN OR THE U.S.
B000Q6GUW0|2.0|It appears that most reviewers are focusing on the show itself, but if you're thinking of buying the entire first season on DVD you probably already know how great it is.  In short, the show is amazing and Michael C. Hall is one of the most underrated dramatic actors.    On to the DVD...this set is not a very good treatment of this fantastic show.  The video quality is subpar and one can only hope that an HD-DVD/Blu Ray release is on the horizon.  The show was broadcast in HD...why was this not released in that format?  And it may be nitpicking, but the menus are atrocious and give the production a cheap feel.    If one believes what they read, it would appear from the packaging that there are ample special features.  On further inspection, the \\"special features\\" are heavily padded with filler and largely underproduced.  The first one listed is \\"The Academy of Blood - a Killer course\\"...I have no idea what this is as I was unable to find it on any of the discs. The featurette is only tenuously connected to the show in that it involves murder investigation. Most of the other features are cross-promos for other Showtime programs (episodes of Brotherhood, etc.).    It also appears that some studios have not caught on that good commentaries are excellent incentive for purchasing a DVD set of a show, ESPECIALLY if it has a cultish following.  You could probably get away with little or no commentary on a Will and Grace DVD, but on a show like Dexter the fans want as much depth as possible.  On this set we get two commentaries out of 12 episodes: the first is with several cast members (NO MICHAEL C. HALL!) and the second is with producers.  The producer commentary is decent and offers some insight, but the cast commentary is largely rambling and suffers greatly from the absence of Michael C. Hall.  I respect all of the actors on the show, but I'm sure I'm not alone in wanting to hear mostly from the main character. In a laughable oversight the studio does not list which episodes have commentary on any of the packaging or menus, which lead to a somewhat annoying search. You basically have to put in each disc and drill down to each episode to see if there is commentary or not.  Here's a tip for those that have not yet purchased...the commentaries are on Episode 6 on disc 2 and on the finale on disc 4.  It is puzzling that they chose to ignore the convention of having commentary on the first episode so that cast and crew could introduce the show and speak to its beginnings and main themes.    Bottom line is if you love the show you'll buy this, but don't get your hopes up about the extras or overall quality of the presentation. Here's hoping for an HD release with better extras down the road.
0767802470|5.0|A great print of a great production. This gives a portrait of the war at sea in WW11 from the German perspective. The movie gives you the feeling of the unremitting terror and boredom of a long sub- marine patrol. You get the sense of the claustrophobic confines of German subs which weren't as large as the U.S. subs. You can almost smell the stench of the men who have gone weeks without bathing and the awful odors coming from the single head serving over 50 men. When the movie is through, you feel you had also gone on the patrols. A great movie in every respect. a must see.
B0002IU988|5.0|This debut album lead by former Creed guitarist Mark Tremonti and singer Myles Kennedy is actually quite refreshing. There are hints of Creed throughout, but this is for the most part a new sound. Kennedy's vocals implement the aggresive nature of such songs as, \\"Find the Real,\\" and \\"Down to My Last.\\" Say what you will about them being mainstream, they still write and perform great music. I actually regard this as one of the best hard rock albums in the last 15 years. Give it a listen, see for yourself. I have high hopes that Alter Bridge will eclipse even Creed's legacy. Their new CD, Blackbird, is due out October 9th, 2007 and the new single, \\"Rise Today,\\" further solidifies the fact that they are back for another rocking album. Alter Bridge is for real.
B000024D4R|5.0|THis album is conceptually different as well as musically different from the previous two albums. The songs take a more sinister view on humans and veiwing them as animals. THe backup singers and Dick Parry's saxophone have been replaced by David Gilmour's fine guitar work. And most noticably, Waters has taken control and read a lot of George Orwell. Also the unusual length of the songs make the album stand-out.     A great album nonetheless but still not nearly as good as its predecesors(DSOTM, WYWH).    1. Pigs on the Wing 1: Not conceptually linked but adds a touch of flavor to the album as a love song to Waters' wife. This should have been combined with part 2 and have including Snowy White's bridging guitar solo that was on the 8-track. (1:26)    2. Dogs: Great Beginning and end however the interlude and bridges makes the song slightly loose momentum. Good Song Nonetheless. (17:08)    3. Pigs: Another good song with political metaphors pertaining to the 1970s. A hard-edged song that seems to be influenced by the emerging Punk scene. However like Dogs it seems to drift endlessly. (11:28)    4. Sheep: My favorite song on the album the describes the rise of the proletariat, so to speak. The only song that doesn't feel like it is 10 minutes. The ending is truly great in that the simple guitat solo creates a profounding effect. It would have been better to have this song as the album-closer. (10:20)    5. Pigs on the Wing 2: See Pigs on the Wing 1. (1:26)
B000TSIK14|5.0|After the last CD by the scorps \\"Unbreakable\\" i was somewhat skeptical about the hype that surrounded this CD, such as this being the best since the mid-80s. But I have to agree for once withthe hype! This is an amazing collection of intelligent, at times aggressive music. The Scorpions prove once and for all that they can hold thier own riff wise with the likes of Rob Zombie and the like (Hour 1, 321) Its nice to see that some of the great masters of metal music are still willing to get up off thier butts and show the young punks how its done! Bands like Heaven and Hell, Judas Priest, and now the Scorpions. I'm not going to bore you with blow by blow discriptions, just go out buy the damn CD and let it blow you thru the wall!!!
B000MG1ZGA|4.0|When an artist goes back and changes a beloved classic, like George Lucas did with Star Wars, it is hard not to have mixed feelings because at some point the artist will change something important and ruin the mood and good feelings and make a mess of a good thing. The surviving Doors keep my mixed feelings churning with L.A. Woman. On one hand, I sometimes like the expanded sound range and instrumental clarity. I like the strange sound added at the start of L.A Woman but the drums seem to thud more here where the lighter touch of the original was more fitting, which could be said for most of the CD. Riders On The Storm is the most perfect last song ever written, but the delicate mood is not helped by the heavier handed remix. Orange County Suite is a moody piece that fits in perfectly. Texas Radio And The Big Beat will always be my favorite Doors song. One problem I have is the annoying \\"woo hoo\\" at the beginning of \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" and the alternate verse pasted in. Just because the tape was sitting in the vault does not mean it needed to be used. Would 64 year old Jim Morrison approve or just leave it to his bandmates to do as they wish? It's unknown. I'm not incredibly upset by it all because I have the great 1999 remastered CD to fall back on if I dislike anything here. That's the key to enjoying any of the 40th Anniversary Mixes - have the 1999 versions next to them on the shelf or on your iPod. But if an artist is going to muck around with a 5 star masterpiece, if I don't find all the changes to my liking I can't give the new version 5 stars anymore. L.A. Woman is my personal favorite Doors album and always gives me a melancholy feeling no matter what mix or version - Jim Morrison was artistically rising and as poetically powerful as ever at the same time he was personally falling apart. The rest of the band were brilliant and creative behind him. I see him receeding into the storm clouds and into history at the end of the album, like the old blues man he inceasingly sounded and looked like, with the world knowing they would not see his or The Doors likes again anytime soon.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|BETTER!    I love the change.      This is where I come from: First off, I HATE American Idol.  I didn't even give Kelly a chance until I heard \\"Breakaway.\\"  And it was \\"Because of You\\" that I fell in love with her.  I went back and bought \\"Thankful\\" mainly because of \\"Low\\" after seeing the video.  I didn't like \\"Thankful\\" as much as I liked \\"Breakaway,\\" though I still enjoyed it quite a lot.  I like the rock stuff is why.  This is because I feel I am a true fan.  I actually like her for her vocals, not just the style of music.      If you are simply a \\"saveur du jour\\" fan, then go with this years AI winner.  As for me, I'll stick with the original, because SHE can evolve as an artist.
B000NA2776|4.0|Back in February, there was a lot of talk going around about a new Lebanese singer named Mika. I didn't know who he was, but after a while I didn't give him much thought because it seemed that by the time March came around, people stopped talking about him. But I picked up his debut album anyway and I was impressed.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Life In Cartoon Motion is supposed to mean, but no matter; this is a great album. There really isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said by all the other four (and five)-star reviewers, but I have to admit that I was initially going to say that it's a little too soon to compare Mika to Freddie Mercury -- but then I realized that that comparison seems to be unavoidable (but let's still wait until his second album and see what happens). What I DO agree with, though, is the comparison to Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters.<br /><br />Once you look past all the comparisons, there are still fine songs like \\"Lollipop\\", \\"Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)\\" and \\"Ring Ring\\". Mika also does well with ballads, like \\"Any Other World\\" and especially \\"Happy Ending\\". But I wonder what version of the album I have because my copy has thirteen songs instead of eleven; the two extra songs are \\"Over My Shoulder\\" and \\"Erase\\" (which are also highlights).<br /><br />One song I can do without, though, is \\"Love Today\\". Not only are the lyrics less than stellar, but Mika is continually doing his falsetto at the wrong times. And \\"My Interpretation\\" is confusing; in fact, the end of the chorus that features \\"This is my interpretation/And it don't don't make sense\\" took the words right out of my mouth. Finally, as reviewer MickeyRat said best, that woman's (graphic) rambling about a love affair gone wrong at the end of \\"Ring Ring\\" doesn't belong; to be honest, I couldn't really understand what was going on.<br /><br />But Life In Cartoon Motion is still a wonderful album. It's not for everyone, but if you look at Scissor Sisters, you should know that THEIR music isn't for everyone either. But if you can give Mika's work a chance, you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />Anthony Rupertr. But if you can give Mika's work a chance, you'll enjoy it.    Anthony Rupert
B000005YZM|5.0|Alright, it'd take about seven lives to go through a tenth of the psychedelic output from the mid sixties and I may still have a hell of a lot to discover end enjoy, but in my book, this is by far the best record I've ever heard. Better than anything the Beatles or Brian Wilson ever did in terms of LP, with the exception of 'Smile' probably.  All twelve tracks are killers, replete with spine-tingling vocal harmonies, light-hearted melodies and clever arrangements. Not a thing I do not adore about this record. Even the artwork does it for me.   After more than a zillion listenings I still unearth new tricks burried in the mix.   Standout tracks : 'Care of Cell 44'(gushing vocal harmonies, more intense than anything the Beach Boys ever did), 'A Rose For Emily' (rates higher than Macca's For No One'), 'Beechwood Park' (will make you want to purchase a tremolo FX pedal)...  You gotta own this album !
B000OCXMAE|5.0|If you love every second of the first two Linkin Park studio albums, Minutes to Midnight may sound like an unwelcome departure.  However, if you've enjoyed the first two discs, but felt Linkin Park was capable of much more, you're going to like this.  The sound is different, the industrial piece is not as prevalent, but this is a mature third album by a band who's trying to grow.  My favorite songs are \\"Shadow of the Day\\" and \\"Leave Out All the Rest,\\" both incredible songs.  Give this a couple of listens.  If you're willing to allow a band to grow and try something different, without abandoning their sound completely, give Minutes to Midnight a shot.  If you've been a fan of Linkin Park for awhile, don't judge too soon.  This is worth a few spins!

With its<br />stylized painted flat sets and exaggerated makeup and acting<br />technique,Caligari single-handedly established the Expressionistic school<br />of filmmaking and created MANY standard HORROR plot devices-The mad<br />doctor,the ZOMBIE,the abducted heroine being carried off and I LOVE<br />saying this the FIRST!!!!!!!! To use the FAMOUS shock-twist ending<br />that is STILL used today! If you are a lover of HORROR or just<br />great cinema...Buy the DOCTOR...ITS TIME FOR MOTHER TO COME HOME<br />AND YOURS IS IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0393061310|5.0|By writing Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond set out to do the impossible. He attempts to explain the entire span of human history in 425 pages. However, Diamond manages to offer a logical argument to why the world has evolved into what it is today. Diamond takes into account all the important factors for the creation of civilization: domesticable animals, geography, native agriculture, factors for trade, etc... Then, Diamond goes on to show why the Eurasian continent managed to achieve supremacy over the others, and it was because of any particular competence of Caucasians over any other peoples. Rather, as Diamond explains, it was the fact that crucial natural resources, including plant and animal species, are native to Eurasia. The fact that the other continents lacked such resources is the driving reason why Eurasians could so easily over-power other peoples, especially in the Americas and Africa.   Guns, Germs, and Steel is a must read for anyone who wishes to better understand the world around them. I read Guns, Germs, and Steel because of an assignment from my World History class, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. Diamond does a phenomenal job of presenting facts in a manner that makes this book separate from many others in the non-fiction category. Rather than being a textbook and spitting out facts, Guns, Germs, and Steel draws the reader in to examine Diamond's theories and does so in a manner that makes the novel enjoyable. By reading this book one obtains a far better understanding of the world around one's self, and allows one to look through an objective looking-glass into the past and better understand why the world works the way it does. Perhaps the best way to explain this book is with a quote from Bill Gates's review, \\"[Guns, Germs, and Steel] Lays a foundation for understanding human history.\\"   I enjoyed this book and its inward look at humanity. Guns, Germs, and Steel, has simply been an incredible read, and its explanatory powers are incredible. This book has influenced my state of mind, and has permanently altered my view of history. I would suggest this book to anyone who asks himself or herself the question \\"why\\" when he or she considers deep divide between industrialized countries, and the rest.
B00005JPQL|4.0|Tristan (Cox) loves Victoria (Miller).  He would do anything for her, so when she asks him to retrieve a fallen star, he sets out across a magical wall and enters the realm of Stormhold.  To his surprise, the star is actually a woman named Yvaine (Danes).  She isn't happy to be on the earth, and does not want to go with Tristan.  He makes a deal with her to help her find a way back into the heavens if she just comes with him back to Victoria.  Meanwhile, the witch Lamia (Pfeiffer) is looking for Yvaine as well.  She wants to cut out the star's heart to gain eternal life.  Finally, Septimus (Strong) needs Yvaine's necklace to claim the throne.  Eventually, all will meet in a battle that will have consequences for the land of Stormhold.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is very much an adult fairy tale.  Dark at times, and filled with adult humor, most kids will not like it.  The cast, especially Danes, does an excellent job.  The only two sticking points for \\"Stardust\\" are the running time (it runs 5-10 minutes longer than it needs to) and special effects (a little on the cheap looking side).  But those are small quibbles for what is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  It's not a classic, but it is done well, and for that I recommend it.
B00004VW0V|3.0|.....because as much as I like most of what Cat Stevens did back when he WAS Cat Stevens, this album just doesn't make it. The 18-minute title \\"suite\\" is a lot of aimless meandering that has me looking at my watch much of the time, and the remaining songs are some of the least memorable Stevens ever wrote and sang. I suspect this was an album he felt he had to make to \\"get it out of his system,\\" a suspicion backed up by his return to the short song format for his next album, BUDDHA AND THE CHOCOLATE BOX.

B000002UC5|5.0|I always have enjoyed this album. And Ive always hated it as well. On the one hand we were given the experimental side of Paul, dare I say, almost unplugged as I can see him sitting among a small group of listeners with his guitar and easily charming them with these great compositions. They are great tunes and so different then the music he created with that other group that I was sure he had done being Popster Paul and was about to launch a new direction of experimentalism in music that might influence the direction of music in general. Its a real bummer imho listening to this and then listening to that other stuff he put out later, much of it excellent, but never as unique and unpredictable as what he offers here.

B000UX6THK|5.0|Sure, everyone has his/hers favorite TV shows, and preferences shift with seasonal mood, age and experiences. However, THIS IS TELEVISION AT HER BEST! The frivolity of the 80's gave way to the seriousness of the 90's - all painted in 50's Americana nostalgia of innocence lost.<br /><br />Atmospheric, mysterious, intriguing, smart,...Words are just not capable to describe this prematurely terminated series! Every time I watch it I discover another moment, another gem I treasure. Too bad the network executives decided to, first, meddle with the plot and, when this backfired, they treated this masterpiece as filler material. No wonder ratings floundered resulting in the series eventual cancellation.<br /><br />True, the 25 years are not up yet. However, I think that Agent Cooper has remained trapped in the Waiting Area long enough. Let's all petition David Lynch for a long-awaited movie or TV mini-series to tidy things up.<br /><br />This particular BoxSet is everything Season 2 was not: excellent picture and sound quality AND all the missing Extras! Commercials, trailers and product spin-offs...<br />My advice: if you already own Season 1, sell it, avoid Season 2, and buy this one.<br /><br />Own it and make weekends out of it. Once in a blue moon a certain magic manifests amongst us. One that never fades.<br />And there is always music in the air.<br /><br />How do I know? A gentle giant told me.
0471267554|4.0|My doctor recommended this diet to me. When I got the book I didn't think  there would be any way I could adhere to it--it seemed too extreme.  The premise is that foods we ate for thousands of years before the agricultural revolution (meats, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) are the foods that are the healthiest and best suited to us today. The author advises the elimination of all grains and dairy products. What makes it doable are three \\"Open\\" meals per week in which the dieter can enjoy foods from the forbidden list. I've found it easier to stay on than I imagined in the short term. I don't know how well someone can adhere to the diet in the long term but the pounds seem to come off quickly in the beginning.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Anyone who claims that BROTHERS IN ARMS is somehow less than the self-titled debut or MAKING MOVIES is doing nothing more than throwing a huge temper-tantrum. While those albums blended the influences of Dylan, Springsteen, the Band, and the Allman Brothers Band into loose-yet-tight jams, this one uses those same influences to create rootsy pop-rock songs that are intelligent enough for classic-rock radio, yet hooky enough for pop formats. The big hit, \\"Money For Nothing\\", was an indictment of MTV and musical commercialism in the guise of a pop-rock song, and is so catchy that it inspired many young women to clear up their skin with Proactiv so that their boyfriends would be more adventurous in their dance-song choices, whereas the other Top Tenner on here, \\"Walk Of Life\\", was a cross between \\"Sultans Of Swing\\" and \\"Expresso Love\\", \\"The Man's Too Strong\\", \\"One World\\", and the title track could be seen as calls for people to stop calling girls with bad skin \\"acne queen\\", and \\"So Far Away\\", a ballad which went Top Twenty, was a ballad that expressed longing and loneliness. This was an essential album of 1985, and takes me back to my first summer at camp.
B00004S367|5.0|This Stevie Wonder album came out in 1972 and it began a very, very long line of brilliant music.  Each album that came out after this one have pieces that are now standards.  You will not be disappointed!!
B000VAPZM2|3.0|I didn't enjoy the first movie, but decided to go ahead and watch the sequel.  Unfortunately, the first one's better.  I got really tired of Gabriella (she's a whiner) and Sharpay (too over the top).  The only main character I enjoyed was Sharpay's brother (I forget his name).  That character was very well-written and the only one I felt that wasn't canned.  I wasn't thrilled with the acting with this one either.    True to the first movie, the dance and music sequences were spectacular.  The kids do have talent in the singing and dancing departments.  However, the soundtrack sounded like it was in a box or something.  I felt the soundtrack on the first movie was better.  This time around, there were echoes from time to time, and also some sequences sounded muffled.  This is why I dropped my rating from 4 to 3 stars.    I really don't understand the success of HSM series (they're working on a third.  Why?!?!).  I think the series is cheesy and cornball.  I guess substandard entertainment is par for the course nowadays.  It's supposed to be geared to preteens and young teens, but most of the ones I know felt both movies were lame.  Oh well.  I generally enjoy DCOM movies, but this series bombed.  I guess slick marketing is the reason why it's been so successful.  I wonder when this movie will be turned into a play like the first one was (ugh!).    Come on Disney, you can do better than this series.
B000002VCZ|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - After the release of the comprehensible and more soft but consistent Ammonia Avenue, Vulture Culture followed up with a more commercially adaptable, soft but heartful pop basis. Its regarded as the last of TAPP trillogy of well sold albums, having the greatest number of vocal contributions provided by his partner Eric Woolfson, just because of that fact, the album is valuable and really enjoyable for me. Still, Vulture Culture keeps some memorable, 80's style compositions with very comprehensible and easy to listen moods, if you lived in the 80's you'll find yourself nostalgic with Days Are Numbers (The Traveller) or Lets Talk About Me, but still is one of their least efforts, it may sound scary for TAPP early fans, and its lack of remarkable compositions and possessing no trace of intelligent prog, it may result a dissapointment for early fans, specially if you hated Ammonia Avenue.<br /><br />Vulture Culture remains with an uncompromising, commercial popcraft basis, but the problem is that its an unmemorable or least popcraft, it isn't thoughtful or remarkable pop like Chicago's Chicago II or Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and although its tough to compare in pop matters The Alan Parsons Project with these dedicated artists, Alan Parsons should have thought it twice before releasing this kind of material, but anyway I find it very enjoyable and delicate, but not a memorable one. In this structure, there are still heartful ballads and emotional compositions, and there is also to find an adult contempo effort, plus the instrumental Hawkeye and a slight trace of originality in Let's Talk About Me. Vulture Culture keeps emotional, sentimental, mellow, enjoyable and beautiful moods. There is also the society critisizing theme, yet a typical theme from the band, regarding just the famous vulture culture. A highlight in the album is that among with Ammonia Avenue, is their only one wich isn't a concept album, plus the unconventional but interesting way they like to put a bunch of people talking at the very backing vocals.<br /><br />This album is maybe the shortest one they've ever released, unnecessary to claim that they seemed to go lazy, plus the fact that it only contains one instrumental piece. Almost every song is a touchy and delicate ballad, no surprises in this aspect, but still they're some which are slightly nostalgic and memorable, and certainly the best, like the memorable, emotional and powerful Let's Talk About Me, the only song which keeps a more thoughtful and remarkable composition, its my best recommendation in this album, while the sentimental, mellow and heartful ballad Days Are Numbers (The Traveller) stays as a top selection, among with the upbeat urban style of the tilte track, Vulture Culture. The other songs are also enjoyable and very mellodic, you'll enjoy Separate Lives, The Same Old Sun and Sooner Or Later, the last one Parsons admitted that he thought it would be as great as Eye In The Sky, the three songs are fine ballads all sang by Woolfson. Also the paranoic but still delicate Somebody Out There, and the desert like, interlude instrumental Hawkeye are great. Track pick: Let's Talk About Me, Days Are Numbers, Vulture Culture.<br /><br />Among the artists' performance its obvious their interest for synthesized sounds and drum machines, leaving not a great originality. Eric Woolfson's big vocal contributions are also the main reason of Vulture Culture success, as Woolfson's voice is higly commercial. Its the only TAPP album not to feature Andrew Powell majestic orchestration, a little bit dissapointing in this aspect.<br /><br />In conclussion Vulture Culture remains at the top of The Alan Parsons Project commercial, pop and sofisticated inclinnations, until their rock breakthrough with Stereotomy. Vulture Culture is their third best sold album, and a very enjoyable one, but I may say this because there's nothing I love more than listening to heartful pop, but within I'veheard every TAPP album, this is one that may dissapoint and cause discomfort, draw your conclussions!one that may dissapoint and cause discomfort, draw your conclussions!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are simply the best headphones I have ever heard.<br />They are sturdy, they fit excellently, their sound is delicious, and, in the words of the guy who recommended them to me, \\"they will blow your eardrums before you blow the speakers out.\\"<br />Simply put, find a pro audio store or a friend that has these headphones, give them a listen, and then come back and buy them, because that is what you will want to do.  They rock.
0374530718|4.0|Take an \\"introduction to Philosophy\\" textbook, chop it up, and insert a creepy stalker novel in-between the chapters.      Freud would have a field day with this novel, which is presented as a dream in a dream.     I don't know if 15 year olds would actually read the textbook parts.  I found it useful as a refresher course.
B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis gets dissed a lot these days, even for a prog band, and I'd like to know why. They don't rule the way Yes does, but they're pretty cool. I used to hate them, though. But I don't anymore. The thing that I like about Genesis is their ability to create pure mood. Whereas Yes (who totally f'in' rule and you should buy Close to the Edge, Fragile and The Yes Album right now if you don't have them already) use their long instrumental passages to make your head explode with technically flawless playing, Genesis more goes for atmosphere. As a result, you're left with a lot of long, repetitive keyboard solos that create a hypnotic effect. Hypnotic¸ you hear me? And it's a good thing they are, too. Because not only do they take up most the record (I think the last eight minutes or so of \\"The Cinema Show\\" are keyboard solo), but because the lyrics are for the most part stupid and meaningless. I mean, come on, \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\"? That song's funny! And it's not even supposed to be! But the instrumental part just rules. Same with \\"Firth of Fifth\\", which has a beautiful piano motif. Ten minutes? I want it to be fifty! Come on, Gabriel! You too, Collins, Hackett, Banks and Rutherford! Drop down and give me fifty! And I haven't even gotten to the best song on this album: \\"Dancing with Moonlight Night\\". One of prog-rock's greatest ever songs. The lyrics are tremendous, and the mood is even better! And it's got a flute solo! By Peter Gabriel! And I don't know if it's technically good, since I'm not a flautist, but the mood it creates rules! So then there are two normal pop songs on this album: one was a deserved hit and the other is by far the worst song on this album. \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\" is catchy and funny, in that endearingly madcap British sense. Like Monty Python, you know? The other, \\"More Fool for Me\\", is bad, but it's the only weak point on the album, which is my favorite progressive album after Fragile.
B000NVI1IO|4.0|I can describe AC/DC's music with one word -- unpretentious. There's no attempt at a profound statement. No whining. No sappiness. If you're looking for those three, look somewhere else. This is just honest hard-driving blue collar rock. Now add some blues and you get a great blend. Angus Young's sizzling solos once again highlight this album. Malcolm is as solid as ever. Brian Johnson's vocals gritty vocals provide a perfect balance. Phil Rudd returns on drums, and Cliff Williams on bass. No wonder I keep going back to this group. This album needs to be accompanied by a Cooper's Pale and a meat pie.

0316067598|5.0|I was so moved by this book that I reread it with in days.  I also wrote Marcus Luttrell.      This should be required reading by every senator, congressman, presidential campaigner, and those so easily up in arms over our slaughter of \\"civilans.\\"      War is war.
1594489505|3.0|After reading A Thousand Splendid Suns, be honest with you I was a little disappointed with the book.  However, I'm not saying the book is not worth reading.  Khaled Hosseini did a such a good job telling the story.  However, I was not intrique through out the book as the Kite Runner.  I have to said about A Thousand Splendid Suns is that it shows winthin a country of many culture like Afganistan that it has its own prejudice.  We live here in the US even though we think it doesn't exist, but it still.  I'm not comparing US to Afganistan, but it make you think in that light. Overall this book is a great read, but I wont give a 4 or 5 stars for it like Kite Runner.
B00006JU7T|3.0|Serpico is a movie that is worth seeing for Al Pacino fans.  He puts on a great performance.  However, the movie struggles to hold my attention during its 130 minute run time.  It is very slowly paced with many long shots.  This movie strives to stay true to its biographical source, which means there are dozens of characters and events that unfold that don't seem to flow together.  Most movies would have combined characters and cut down details to make it flow, but this did not.  I'm glad I saw it and I would recommend it to Pacino fans.
B000CNFC76|5.0|It was a great movie, if your friend, spouse, boyfriend ,or girlfriend enjoys golf this is a great gift.  I gave it to   my husband as a surpirse and he was thrilled. It was very entertaining and interesting and well done.
0688014291|4.0|On one hand I really like the way this book gets right to the point without consuming lots of time.  Too many books with a similar mission would spend 400 pages, but this one can be read in an hour.    The brevity is a double-edged blade though, because the book falls short of fully explaining its concepts.  It really touches on only three main approaches to management, but it does not provide anything in the way of examples or contingencies in case real life does not match the story.    I am glad I read it but it is hard to say the book is worth the money.  You really do not get much content for the price.  Upon finishing the book, you'll soon realize the need to buy more books from these authors to flesh out how to implement their suggestions.
0143038419|3.0|If you like silly, neurotic stories-then this one is for you. Its an easy read and the author is reflective, but I didn't come away with the feeling that I had been on a spiritual journey.  First of all, I didn't understand where she was coming from-all divorces are painful but not everyone decides to take off across the world and since she was financially successful, (she even had to give her husband money), I couldn't feel sorry for her or understand her identity crisis. I liked her travels in Bali the best-by then she was overcoming some of her insecurities, but it would have been more interesting to read about the medicine man and the woman she helped save her business, then the love affair that ended like a happy ending.  This is a good summer novel to read on the beach.

0618680004|5.0|This book is simply remarkable, no question.  Dawkins is an intelligent, down-to-earth scientist who confronts the forces of religion without hesitation.  He makes the reader realize the true horrors of supposed \\"good\\" religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) from all angles.<br /><br />Dawkins argues all sides of any concept and any \\"what if...\\"s proposed by the religious.  He puts ignorance into perspective, proving idiocy of all biblical claims.  The Bible is analyzed in this book - and shown in a light so horrific that makes you feel sad billions of people could ever consider such text \\"sacred.\\"  But, Dawkin's witty sense of humour provides the reader with comic relief.<br /><br />Well-written, concise, and an example of very powerful support for atheism & rational thinkers alike.
B000NA28I4|1.0|Okay, first I'll start by listing the good aspects of this movie       1) Brom- He was did a good job playing the old warrior/mentor. However, his character (more like Aragorn from LOTR) is lightyears away from who Paolini presented him to be (more like Gandalf)       2) Saphira's CGI was excellent    Now for the bad       1) As I said before, the script was horrible. It is a grand collection of cliches cut and pasted together in the most unattractive way. Anyone who read the book would be appalled to see how Christopher Paolini's creative dialogue could be so mutated and mashed into a hideous excuse for a movie.       2) The movie was only an hour and 44 minutes long. Let me repeat that- an HOUR AND FORTY- FOUR MINUTES LONG! No way could a movie that short cover a four hundred page book! The director should have tried to simplify the plotline. But no, he tried to tell the whole story of Eragon. The result is a movie that watches like it is perpetually in fast forward.    I guess another positive aspect of this movie is we didn't waste any money on it- we borrowed it from a friend. Anyone who has read the books, if you insist on watching it, don't say you weren't warned.
B000RJO578|2.0|Yes, I understand this movie is supposed to spoof action films but it is not that funny. The pacing is very slow. I kind of felt like the movie was just a build up for one big joke. The first 3/4 of the film was very mundane, and then last part of the film did a 180 degree turn around and become over-the-top ridiculous. I believe that was supposed to be the big joke. Personally, my favorite action spoof is Trey Parker's and Matt Stone's Team America. I suggest that movie instead of this one.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I can still remember the first time I clapped and yelled inside a theatre, I was watching Rocky III in my secondary school uniform over twenty years ago. Time flies, but the fire in the heart is still there, I suppose. So nostaglic it seems, but that's a well calculated project by Stallone. It succeeded, per box office and reviews here. Only around ten minute of boxing scenes, but for sure very captivating. In particular I like the motivational core message much. Twice from Rocky's mouth to win his son back on the street and to get himself up during the game, \\"It aint about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward.\\"  In short, recommended!
1401207529|4.0|I like Year One better than Miller's the Dark Knight Returns. The reason being is that Miller keeps the character of Batman more in tuned to what is, in my opinion, the true Batman. In the Dark Knight Returns, Batman comes across as too much of an anti-hero who is rebelling against the \\"system\\". I felt Miller may have injected too many of his political views into that story. However, in Year One I do not feel this is the case. Overall, this is a very interesting take on Batman's origin. Also, the story focuses quite a bit on Gordon as well. Anyone who liked the movie Batman Begins should read Batman: Year One.
B00008MLSH|4.0|Unlike the passion, intimacy, and beautiful tone Netrebko brought to the Russian Album, the Opera Arias miss these wonderful qualities. There's room at the top for a new operatic power couple and the glamorous Netrebko and rising Mexican tenor Rolando Villazon are desperate to seize. I confess that there is an element of conviction in Netrebko's voice, a significant figure in Russia for more than a decade. No sooner had she arrived on the world stage, her \\"hype\\" started describing her as the new Callas, which she isn't, and suspect will never be. She may have the temperament of Callas and her petulance, but vocally the comparison just is not there! In the magnificant arias from Mozart to Puccini, Netrebko shows a lack of being able to convey the utmost of subtleties, and injecting every aria with the personality of the character she was assuming. Netrebko crashes through everything, with a glorious voice capable of conveying the the justice of both dramatic and lyric arias, but with minimal vocal characterization. Netrebko is at times very capable of expressing genuine emotion in her singing as heard in the Russian CD with music from her homeland. Netrebko is capable of becoming a most formidable artist if she continues to learn; especially if she works hard on the Italian and French repertoire as she demonstrates in her Russian work, and with the watchful direction of the Marlinsky's Valery Gergiev. In that regard it's encouraging to hear she's preparing for an important Bellini run at the Met with Renata Scotto. Her Russian aria was fine, but her Gounod aria seems to wash away from its inner qualities, not helped by some disturbing French.<br />Netrebko is without doubt, an inspiring, extremely talented artist, and with the experience and maturity her voice will command in the future, she will rise to the occasion of becoming one of the world's greatest 21st century singers!
B000083C49|5.0|It is really funny watching the Enterprise crew attempt to assimilate into the 1980's.  It is a refreshing change to see the self assured members of Admiral Kirk's crew acting awkward and so unsure of themselves.      One of my favorite lines is when Admiral Kirk told them to break it up, because they look like a cadet review.  It cracks me up every time.  My favorite part of the movie was when Jane Wyatt appeared as Spock's human mom, Amanda.  She was beautiful, radiant, and just completely left a lasting impression on me and countless others.  It was to be her last movie role.  I also thought that they did a tremendous job with the soundtrack.    I have watched this movie countless times.  I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00005QCVT|5.0|I came across this movie by accident at blockbuster. I put it in the dvd player really not knowing what to expect. I don't know what to say about this movie. I have never been affected so much by a film. After the film was over I was kind of paralized. I was filled with so much emotion. You cannot help but feel the characters pain. I must recognize this film for what it really is, a piece of art. If you watch this film sit down and be ready to let it sink in.    Harry crying: No....She won't come.    I can never expect to feel the same way after watching another film.
0060566108|5.0|It is interesting to review a business book more than 10 years after it has been labeled a best seller - is it still relevant today?  Yes, in the case of this classic! The lessons conveyed are as useful today, as they were when it was first published. No surprise, given what the authors set out to discover when they began their research: What distinguishes long-time, high performing companies from their competitors? Their key concept about what it takes to build a visionary company - \\"preserve the core and stimulate progress\\" seems to be a fundamental truth about the evolutionary nature of free markets. Certainly their, \\"Try Lots of Stuff and Keep What Works\\" and \\"Good Enough Never Is\\", lessons sound like evolutionary processes of adaptation.<br /><br />The key concept might be more simply described by saying, \\"Maintain your identity - core values & purpose - while focusing on a living performance vision.\\" That makes it a personal concept as well as an organizational concept - not a bad thing when you consider that any organization is a collection of people. When something makes sense for the individual and the organization, perhaps there-in resides the reason it is a long-term winner! Dennis DeWilde, Author of The Performance Connection
1596912855|3.0|Austenland is a fluffy, not completely satisfying, novel.  My biggest problem with the novel is Penbrook Park.  I can't imagine anyone going there or atleast wanting to stay once they got there.  Even the characters were bored there.  I hope that Miss Hale makes another attempt at an romance.  She writes very well, especially for young adults, but needs to create a more satisfying or believable premise for adults.
1591840562|5.0|Written like he was delivering a speech, Guy Kawasaki has made this an enjoyable and interesting read.  All the time I was turning the pages, I kept feeling that much of what he wrote applied to life, and not just starting a business. When I got to the final chapter, \\"The Art of Being a Mensch\\", I discovered why I had gotten that feeling - much of Kawasaki's business approach emanates from his way of being in life. Read it for thoughts on how to live; read it for its humor, read it for advice - but do read it!  Dennis DeWilde, Author of The Performance Connection.
0385522401|5.0|I loved this book.  It was nothing like I expected. I was amazed how a whole book could be about one night, the wedding night.  It was very telling how two people can be together, love each other and the pain that can come from disconnection.  Lack of communication and understanding is the unmentioned villan.  I don't know if the author Intended it but i laughed out loud at horrible moments.
0307237699|4.0|This book follows [[ASIN:1400082773 Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance]], Obama's recently republished autobiographical work of about 10 years ago. As in Dreams, he's at his best when describing personal experiences and observations. We learn how it feels to be in the Senate Chambers, fly in a private jet and juggle a public career and family life.  I loved the vignettes of meeting Sen. Byrd and Pres. Bush, etc.<br /><br />Unlike many in the limelight he acknowledges and sympathizes with the stress his career choices have visited upon his family.<br /><br />With great optimism, Obama speaks to how far this country has come.  He reminds us of the too often unspoken deal with the devil.... a Constitution designed to embed slavery... that defined the founding.<br /><br />He compares the American system with the rest of the world where bribes, not talent, will get you a job.  He visits Iraq and sees American ingenuity in the ability to build large scale projects.  Obama travels with Republicans and Democrats. While disagreeing with many Republicans, he can state their arguments in a respectful way and refute them with reason.<br /><br />He has a disarming honesty and old fashioned values. Through his mother's family he relates to midwestern values, and through his father, the world.<br /><br />The title of this book is taken from a sermon which he more fully describes in Dreams. It is a perfect summary of the points he is making.  With so much cynicism in the world, it has become audacious to note progress and express hope for the future.<br /><br />I rated this with 4 stars and not 5 because I liked Dreams better, but this is a matter of taste.  Both are recommended reads.
B00006JJ2Y|5.0|I'm appalled at the number of people who think Lou Reed -- or ANYbody -- could cultivate and maintain this high-energy, high-speed stream-of-consciousness comedic rant'n'ramble merely under the effects of alcohol.     . . . alcohol?!?    SPEED, people, speed!  Methedrine.  Injected, not snorted.  It's a matter of record, no pun intended.  (Reed may deny certain elements of his past, but not his years as a speed addict.)  While there may have been a drink or six in his system, the main fuel was methedrine (as with the original Lenny Bruce himself).  If you want to criticize the album for being drug-influenced, at least GET IT RIGHT.    As long as I'm correcting the record, I'll also mention that -- comedy aside -- this album contains a musically magnificent version of \\"Berlin\\".  I was never wild about the full-length song in the first place, but this version just smokes!  And if you hated \\"Leave Me Alone\\" on Street Hassle (it's okay, I hate that whole album), you might still like the version here, tightened up and given a memorable melodic riff.      But it's \\"Satellite of Love\\" which single-handedly justifies this album's existence.  No comedy, no storytelling.  Just an inspired reworking of an already-beautiful tune, jazzy ornaments on a new melody that is both boisterous and wistful.  And then there's THAT GUITAR . . . .
0451196716|5.0|My favorite book ever.  This book is amazing and there truely are no words to describe it.  I was honestly surprised, i figured there would be a main character and he was the only one you would care about, but halfway through the book i found myself caring for 5 different characters not wanting them to lose and die.  So yes, this is an amazing book and you are stupid for not buying it the moment you read this review.
0307341550|3.0|Gill Flynn has written a great small-town book.  In other words, she writes of a pretty little town with very unpretty people.  Every character in this novel is psychologically scarred or trying to scar someone else.  Are people really this bad?    Two fourth-grade girls have disappeard from this area where everyone knows everyone.  No mysterious strangers off their psych meds have wandered through the neighborhood, so the denizens of the town have to admit the perpetrator must be one of their own.  A 30-year-old who got out in time to make a life (of sorts) for herself in Chicago comes back to town to investigate the crimes for her paper.  She gets involved and manages to dredge up a solution.    The story is fairly compelling; and even if you already have an idea who the bad guy(s) is/are by the end of the story, the payoff is palpable and satisfying.  Ms. Flynn writes simply, straightforwardly, and well.  I would definitely consider reading her next work of fiction.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|\\"Cold Mountain\\" (2003) tries to be The Odyssey told during the Civil War -the story of a man on his way home to his eternal love and all the obstacles and tribulations he faces. There a lot to admire in \\"Cold Mountain\\" - Anthony Minghella sure knows how to make a good-looking film with great views and impressive cinematography. This and his previous films, \\"The English Patient\\" and \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" are the good examples of his craft. The war scene in the beginning of the film is very impressive - realistic, powerful and violent. I did not read the book, so I can not comment on what parts were left out but the love story between Inman (Law) and Ada (Kidman) did not touch me very much. I am not sure if it has to do with the story itself or with the performances of two main characters but they were overshadowed by the supporting characters played by Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Kathy Baker, and Giovanni Ribisi. Some of them had only few minutes of screen time but their characters are interesting and alive. Renee Zellweger received all possible awards that year for her turn as Ruby, funny looking but strong, energetic and independent woman who had helped the helpless and lonely Ada to manage her farm after her father died. I liked the character but I was not too impressed by Zellweger's performance. I think she had overplayed and made Ruby too grotesque. I've seen four Oscar nominated performances from 2003 and I liked two much better than Renee Zellweger.<br /><br />There is a very frank love scene between Law and Kidman in the end. It is the well made scene but too beautiful considering that two lovers went through the nightmares of war, starvation, disease, and the lack of any decent conditions. I saw on the screen two very attractive people in great shape with sexy bodies but not two lovers of Cold Mountain during the devastating war.
1416523359|2.0|This is in my opinion Stephen King's weakest effort, and I have read and thoroughly enjoyed much of his work.  I consider him to be one of the greatest living authors and story tellers of our time with unparalleled talent.  This novel comes off as a solid short story, stretched out into 500 pages.  There just isn't a lot there.  The tale of Lisey and her now deceased husband is compelling, but it is so sparsely planted throughout the novel that it was like watching 10 minutes of a good movie every month until it is completely viewed.  I was unable to become engaged either to the story or the characters.  Rare for me, I put this book down at some point a hundred pages or so in, and read another book then came back to it weeks later and only continued because it was a King novel.  I was able to stick faithfully to the Dark Tower series, which must be 5000+ pages, easier than I could to 100 pages of this book.  I did not find compelling characters or story in this book.
B000002UTY|4.0|With guitarist Gary Duncan's imminent departure looming in the background, \\"Happy Trails\\" immortalizes one side of the original QMS quartet's concert and ballroom legacy. While Quicksilver's debut had showcased ex-folkie bassist David Freiberg's ear for quirky material and the band's few attempts at songwriting, this album emphasizes Duncan's backlog of rhythm-and-blues garage tunes (Bo Diddley's \\"Who Do You Love\\" and \\"Mona\\"), brought to life by John Cipollina's inimitable finger-picked electric guitar leads, as well as Duncan's own daredevil psychedelic forays. As one of the first recordings of its kind, \\"Happy Trails\\" suffers a bit in retrospect -- mediocre sound quality, shoddy drumming, and occasional improvisational dead ends -- but its bright spots are as exciting and triumphant as acid rock has ever been.
0451529308|5.0|I must have read LITTLE WOMEN when I was about ten years old, yet, it is one of those exceptional examples of literature that stays with you years after you've first come to know the March sisters, their trials, triumphs, joys and sorrow.  This beautiful book truly captures the strength of family, the courage one must exercise in the face of great adversity and the wisdom we are lucky to acquire if we get through it in one piece.  Jo March is the epitome of the irrerepressible, hot-headed and adventurous tomboy.  Her character was actually based on the personality of the author, Louisa May Alcott.  Meg is the eldest and the most traditionally-minded,  Beth is the more retiring, shy and selfless one and Amy is the selfish and strategic one.  Together, they all are devoted to and have great respect for their mother, Marmee March, and await the arrival of their father who is serving as a chaplain for the Union Army.<br /><br />LITTLE WOMEN is the first book in a series chronicling the lives of these intriguing and well-developed characters.  Even more than one hundred years later, this book still presents timeless themes of friendship, courage, dedication, faith and determination.  It's not difficult to see why this story was retold so many times in film.
B000KJTKHA|5.0|Warning: \\"Electric Mud\\" is a blues album with heavy psychedelic rock influences! If you consider yourself to be a blues purist, then I would encourage you to look elsewhere for something that will be more compatible with your musical tastes. With that disclaimer out of the way, let me invite those who are seeking something unusual--and especially those who like sixties rock music--to continue reading on.  I consider this to be one of most original albums that I have ever heard. It is not a true blues album, but rather a concept album of blues with a heavy psychedelic rock influence. The idea for this album had its genesis with Marshall Chess, the son of Leonard Chess of Chess Records. Marshall Chess had just founded a new label named Cadet Concept, and this was the second album produced under the new label. When this album was recorded, Waters' career was in a slump; it had been a decade since he had a top ten hit. Marshall Chess was seeking out a new audience for Muddy Waters. The CD booklet (which is extremely well written) goes on to explain that this was one of Waters albums that \\"effectively revived Muddy's recording career at a time when he was in danger of becoming an elder statesman who couldn't sell to his own community and who was revered exclusively by a small coterie of collector-purists, not a large enough audience to sustain a career.\\"    This album was recorded in April 1968, and here's what was happening on the music scene at the time. On 1 July 1967, the Beatle's reached number one on the charts with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\"--a psychedelic rock album that won the 1967 Album of the Year Grammy Award. The Beatles reached number one on the charts again on 6 January 1968 with \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\" A new artist, Jimi Hendrix, had exploded onto the psychedelic rock scene with \\"Are You Experienced?\\" (chart debut 9/16/67; top position #5) and \\"Axis: Bold As Love (chart debut 2/17/68, top position #3). (All chart data is from \\"The BillboardBook Of Top 40 Albums, Revised and Enlarged 3rd Edition\\" by Joel Whitburn, 1995.) Jimi Hendrix is mentioned a number of times in the CD booklet. Hendrix was noted for his use of new electronic gizmos to modify his guitar tone, including the wah-wah pedal and the fuzz box. \\"Electric Mud\\" was not meant to be a direct copy of the Hendrix sound, but it was definitely influenced by it.    The basic instrumentation on this album includes a heavily distorted guitar (often with wah-wah pedal), fuzz-tone electric bass, saxophone, synthesizer, and drums. This is quite a stretch from the trademark Muddy Waters sound! The CD booklet points out that \\"five of the eight songs on 'Electric Mud' were 'classics' from his catalogue, songs he had sung hundreds, perhaps thousands, of times. So the Main Man sang as he always had. His accompaniment, however, was very much of the moment.\\" It is well known that many of the rock musicians of the sixties had blues influences. Now, here is a genuine bluesman cutting an album with new renditions of his songs, such as \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You,\\" \\"I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,\\" and \\"Mannish Boy,\\" in more of a rock style. There is even a cover of the Rolling Stones hit \\"Let's Spend The Night Together.\\" Wouldn't you agree that's a cool concept for an album?    The vocals are one of the strong selling points of this album, and Muddy Waters has a great voice. The lyrics include occasional social commentary appropriate for the times. All of the musicians on this album were highly regarded studio players. It has been pointed out in another review, as well as in the CD booklet, that Waters felt that the drums were too \\"busy\\" on this album. I would like to comment on that, because I am a drummer myself. The drumming on this album was done by a studio drummer named Morris Jennings. Although he was a jazz drummer, his playing on this album is very true to the psychedelic rock concept. Mitch Mitchell, of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, was himself a very \\"busy\\" drummer. When the Beatles hit the music scene in 1964, Ringo Starr played a very \\"unbusy\\" style, but times had changed by 1968, and even Ringo had somewhat changed his own style to accommodate.    I have tried to be as helpful as possible by warning the prospective buyer about what this album is about, but I hope that blues purists will not be offended by my saying that I really like this album. To be sure, it is not for everyone, but it is for me. I think that \\"Electric Mud\\" is very original and unique, and I value having it as a part of my collection. My primary musical interest is classic rock, although I do have a modest collection of blues, including some of Muddy Waters' mainstream works.

B00004W510|5.0|How do you write a review for one of rock music's true masterpieces? You simply can't. Yes Big Pink broke new ground, but this baby just brims over with an honest-to-goodness approach to Robbie Robertson's greatest songwriting. I mean does it get any better than Dixie Down, Rockin' Chair, Cripple Creek and King Harvast?...Then there's Rag Mama Rag, Look Out Cleveland and Jaw-Bone!!!....But wait how about Jemima Surrender, Unfaithful Servant and When You Awake?...Talk about \\"hitting their stride\\"!!! The Band simply put this one down so pure, so honest and true, that even they couldn't improve upon it in their later albums.     Yes, The Band's self titled second album and known most often as simply the \\"Brown Album\\" never grows old. It's never sounded dated or insincere. One thing is for certain, Robbie Robertson's sympathetic characters will make you either smile or laugh out loud. They might even make you cry. They're all so real....Farmers who toil to work the land....Rebel soldiers defeated but still proud and brave...Petty thieves with a sense of right and wrong and run-away slaves contrite for their \\"crime\\" yet determined nonetheless. Robbie Robertson put all these characters together from his years on the road with The Band. And The Band put a whole lot of the road into the music here. There's a bushell full of memories inside these old grooves. Just listen.....Hear those Wispering Pines....Hear the stories they tell, feel the pain and the joy. Relive the days and think back to a simplier time...\\"Oh to be home again back in old Virginny...With my very best friend...They call him Rag-Time Willie\\".
B0007M22TI|5.0|I won't buy the idea that the performances were lip-synced. And the violin bow of Mairead was tilted occasionally for a well-known bowing technique for thinner sound, not so that it wouldn't touch the string.    It's refreshing to see that \\"uniqueness\\" doesn't always mean something radically and purposefully different (the concept mostly assumed in the modern art work). As long as the performers individually communicates through their performance, their work will automatically be unique, without the need to convey radically \\"new idea\\".    Not that easy to make these simple, known, and similar style pieces keep catching audience's attention continuously. Orchestration of both voices and instruments is great. And I personnally like the percussion performances. Overall, someone may be able to do differently, but will never be better.
817224164X|5.0|I read this book for its political, intellectual, and philosophical content and not its anti-Semitism and vitriol. This book should be studied in every political discussion group or government class in America.

B000FVGMC4|5.0|I was stunned by this album. It's hard to imagine someone not liking this music, it's that good. Every now and then I hear someone new and great, this is one of those artists. Paolo's voice is very unusual, with some great accents adding texture to the lyrics, and his writing is superb.    There are lots of comparisons out there to other artists but honestly I'd call Paolo a unique sound. My comparisons range more towards the creativity and wonder of a Bob Marley, Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, etc. Like these great musicians, Paolo is able to take common thoughts and emotions and express them in heartfelt ways through music.    Who knows if he'll keep it going, but for now I'll simply sit back and enjoy this album. Nothing like some new shoes to chear me up :-).
0061124265|5.0|I was surprised at how this story began. How could a girl who believed she was completely normal, and not having any detrimental circumstances just decide to end her life? I think we all imagine (hope anyway) that there's a darn good reason for someone to do this kind of thing. I was surprised that the reasons could be as simple and complicated at the same time as Veronika's were.<br /><br />Veronika fails in her suicide attempt and is placed in a mental hospital. She has a Dr. who convinces her she only has a week or two to live, while he secretly conducts an experiment to bring her out of her depression and give her the will to live.<br /><br />As with all of Paulo Coelho's stories, there are many revelations throughout the story, one being that she actually did die to her old life and ways of thinking when she took those pills to begin with. While Veronika is in the hospital, her presence greatly touches and affects the lives of some other patients.<br /><br />I'm not a speed reader, but I read this over the course of one day, (210 pages)and I enjoyed the story. There were many things that I read with chill bumps thinking that the author could have been speaking directly to me. Which is one of the many reasons why I love this author's books. He knows about life and how to relate and teach things through his stories.  In the back of the book, there is an interesting section on the author's inspiration for the book and some personal insights about his experiences.
0307237699|5.0|Finally a candidate who doesn't sell himself to special interests.  I was inspired by his optimism and reasonableness.  He doesn't bash the right in an effort to promote himself and while he admits he is biased as a Democrat, his main concern is our country as a whole.  Very impressive.  I just hope our country has the forsight to elect this man as the next president.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Well this movie is definitely something that classics are made of.    Movie begins with Will Smith day to day life of not so successful salesman, his ruined married life and the love for his son.     At one point he decides that he has to give up his sales career to go into stock market. When he discusses with his wife she is anything but supportive. He approaches the person for the job who seems to be too busy all the time. However once while making a sales call he happens to travel with this guy and he resolves the rubik's cube in matter of minutes.     He is then interviewed and taken in for an internship without any payment for 6 months. The worst time of his life. He then attends the classroom for six months & manages his sales calls looks after his son since wife has decided on separation. And he utimately emerges as a winner.     When you see this character struggle you actually feel that this is your own story in one way.     Some wonderful scenes    Will Smith finishes his classes at the stock market firm, picks up his son and finishes his sales call and he has to rush back to the place to spend the night as he is homeless and this place is available on first come first serve basis. He doesn't get this place and he has to spend the night on one of the railway platforms. He goes to the rest room where his son sleeps and he is awake and starts crying whenever someone knocks on the door.    Will Smith is really running on a tightrope with finances. When one of his colleagues from the stock market forgets his own wallet he asks Will Smith to pay for the cab. The way Smith gives that 5 - 10 bucks makes you understand value for money    In interview which he attends directly after getting released from prison. He is dressed badly yet attends the interview. He is asked a question, 'What would you say if I hire a person who attends the interview without any shoes?'   Will Smith replies 'Well he must be wearing really good pants'    And the expression when he recieves the job, vow....!!!    About the performances    Will Smith gives probably the best performance of life time. He crawls easily under the skin of the character. He just lives the character. You are reminded of Meryl Streeps performance in Music of the Heart. Nowhere in the entire movie is it evident that Will and Christopher are father and son off screen too. I have seen few movies of Will Smith like MIB, Wild Wild West, Enemy of the state, Independence Day. He has more than matured as an actor. Hats off to him.     Christopher Smith on the other hand gives a flawless performance. The way he cries when he loses his toy makes you feel sorry for the child. He has taken what can be called as legacy from his father. And my personal belief is that he is a gifted actor. I do wish we see a lot more of him.    The movie  Good story, good performance, neat presentation and overall a very good movie. The movie could have been sad in so many places and lost its major vein. But it does not. And it does not loose track. Just like Shawshank Redemption. I dont know the box office business of the movie, I am sure it has done good. But in coming days this movie is going to be on top charts amongst most rented films
0143038419|5.0|This summer, I was studying abroad in China and missing the comfort of visiting my regular bookstores for English-language books, and cursing myself for not thinking to bring any books for pleasure-reading (I was just going to spend two months pouring over textbooks, right?). Around week 6, I was desperate and sought an online audiobook site so that I could download a few titles for iPod listening.    I was instantly addicted to Eat, Pray, Love. This book is insightful and full of wonderful quips and stories. It was especially lovely in audio form, as it is read by the author and therefore includes many of her eccentricities in vocal form. When quoting someone, she always includes the proper accent-- Richard from Texas, or the Balinese medicine man, or an Italian football fan-- making her story come to life.     For a lovely reading journey that spans many levels of life and thought, pick up Gilbert's travelogue/memoir. And if you want to be transported directly to Italy, India, and Indonesia-- and into Gilbert's mind itself-- listen to the book in audio form. Either way, it is a glorious experience.
B000060O58|4.0|Karl Richter represents the Kapellmeister tradition at its best.  Yes, it does have a best!  That tradition's performance practice has little in common with today's period ensembles, and for that reason the musicologically inclined will find little to enjoy in this set.  Others will delight in Richter's invigorating, superbly played Brandenburgs (with outstanding soloists, including Richter himself on the harpsichord).  The Suites are less satisfying, in part because Richter's well-upholstered textures and inclination toward rhythmic rigidity are more damaging in these dance-inspired works.  The \\"Triple Concerto\\" could also use a lighter touch, though one appreciates Richter's intense involvement with the score (he takes it more seriously than many conductors).  Overall, I enjoyed this set immensely, but I'm of a generation that had to \\"relearn\\" how to listen to Baroque music in light of contemporary notions of period performance practice.  Younger listeners with an open mind should hear this, however, just to get a sense of how Bach was performed over a generation ago.

The love story--two people who act on their lust knowing disaster must follow--creates incredible tension. And when disaster falls, Cosner's Jay goes on a quest, meeting some wonderfully colorful and flawed characters that teach him along the way. That Jay must face the man he wronged to find the woman he loves is classic hero's journey. And who doesn't love a tragic ending? This is one of the few cases when I thought the movie surpassed the book, a Jim Harrison novella in the case. This isn't a perfect film, but satifying on so many levels.

B000067J24|4.0|Isabella, the lead character, played by Penelope Cruz, instructs her cooking students, \\"I will show you what inspires me in the hope you will find your own inspiration.  Okay?<br /><br />I think that to cook well, you must bring all your feelings and experience to the act of creation.<br /><br />Let's start with my passion . . .\\"<br /><br />This is a fun romp.  The movie at times has a feeling of a light 1950s or 60s romantic comedy, intentionally overstated and overbroad.  The actors consistently overact as if they were beamed forward in time from some bygone era.<br /><br />A primary comic device in this film is that Isabella has severe motion sickness;  and therefore, she cannot ride in a car, dance, or make love unless she is driving or leading.  When she arrives in San Francisco, after leaving after watching her husband make love to another woman, she cannot take a taxi, but instead bribes the taxi driver so she can drive the taxi herself through San Franciscos steep and curvy streets.<br /><br />Isabella is a chef who has been underappreciated.  As the plot develops, Isabella ritually burns her old husband's photo and throws away all her connections to him.  She gets her mojo back, and suddenly & ridiculously, hundreds of men start to pursue her.  Once she gets on her own, she becomes a wildly successful cooking show host.<br /><br />The husband finds Isabella and tries to reunite with her.  He changes many of his domineering ways.<br /><br />She says,\\"Why couldn't you have been like this before?\\"<br /><br />\\"I don't know.

B000002AGN|5.0|released in 1959 this album was originally intended as an experiment using time signatures which break out the beats in a bar of music which was unorthodox for jazz at that time. This experimental album turned out one of the best known and biggest selling jazz albums of all time. Dave Brubeck on piano, Paul Desmond on alto sax, Eugen Wright on double bass and Joe Morello on drums. The venerable classic TAKE FIVE is on the album and everyone seems to have their own take and memories of that song. A jazz classic, give it a listen, you won't regret it.
B000OYC3J8|2.0|Yup, it's yet another helping of basic songs with less the stellar performances and production. To me they sound no better than a garage band and maybe that's the point here? If that is indeed what their aiming for, they've nailed it!<br /><br />Either way they're not my cup of tea and they should not be compared to bands such as Zeppelin as that band could play and write rings around these two. Let's face facts here people, bands like these are not in the same league in any way shape or form as Zeppelin, The Who, The Stones etc and to compare them is just idiotic!<br /><br />Either the industry is one messed up place, or I'm just not getting what these two are all about?<br /><br />If you like your music simple and I mean simple with maybe two or three chord changes per song and just love crappy production quality?, this is for you!<br /><br />I gave it a 2 stars simply because I feel they may have some decent qualities about them. It's just to bad nobody wants to fix it by hiring a decent drummer, a bass player (to fill out the sound!!) and a guitarist who can actually play!!
B000QXDED6|4.0|A comic book brought to life.  Greek quasi-history never looked more gory or entertaining.  I'm not sure the Spartans were the boy scouts of the ancient world, but they sure sound like US Marines. Loved the whole thing.  The mean nasty Mid-Easty types get their heads handed to them. Nice.
1400063515|5.0|This is an excellent encyclopedic (and acute) expose of the flaws of standard probabilistic analysis and models when they are applied to economics.  A must read for anyone who invests in the Stock Market.  The book, in addition to being an awareness enhancer is witty and entertaining, thus a pleasure to read. A true iconoclast who challenges authoritarian dogmas of mathematical nonsense accepted by the faithful.
B000CCIVDO|5.0|Not only do these headphones produce amazing sound, they last through alot.  I can't tell you how many times they've fallen on the floor and such and they still work great (i've had them for 1+ years) When they're on you can't hear a single thing around around you... and I mean NOTHING which is great for studio work.
B000R9J3X4|4.0|I've been waiting for this greatest hits since tha late nineteens, the selection is great but the second disc, wich i thoug would be great is actually very averge with performances in all the songs, except for the last track wich is by tha way the only one garbage did.
B000PY52EU|4.0|I'm surprised at the number of rave reviews this movie received not because I didn't enjoy it but because it really walks the line in terms of the definition of poor taste. Christina Ricci as the sexually abused and sexually compulsive Rae does spend an awful lot of time writhing around scantily-clad in the grips of post-traumatic stress and has sex with 3-4 different men in the first half-hour of the film. Furthermore, the one man who doesn't want to have sex with her, the dumped and drinking bluesman Lazarus as played by Samuel (there-are-mutha-f**kin-snakes-on-the...) L. Jackson, keeps her confined in his house with a long, black chain. However, perhaps it is the fact that BLACK SNAKE MOAN is so blatant about it's exploitative qualities that saves it from becoming utterly distasteful. Instead, the tale that unfolds on the screen is one of trauma, trust, redemption for two souls, helped along by by the soothing balm of blues music.    One aspect that I would like to commend this film for is its (in my opinion) nearly complete transcendence of the issue of race. That Lazarus was black and Rae was white was only a minor detail to the film. Perhaps it is simply because Lazarus and Rae are so different on so many levels: him--old, morose, alcoholic, and neglected and her: young, manic, traumatized, and sexually compulsive, that black/white is not really a noticeable factor and ultimately it is their similarities, their sense of hurt and need to heal that bring them together.    Among the few weaknesses I could name in the film are some features of the ending. The reverend's role and the sort of therapy session that ensued seemed weak as though the producers had run out of ideas or didn't want to do anything too risky and thus went for the mundane ending. Perhaps my dislike of the ending is also because of the heavy presence of Justin Timberlake. I'm not a fan of JT as a character and personally felt that his acting abilities were weak and that his presence detracted from the point that I thought the producers were trying to make with his character. Rather than seeing Ronnie as a sufferer of panic attacks (taboo for a male), I found myself thinking, \\"Figures, Justin Timberlake would wimp out of military service.\\" On the other hand, I suppose it's better for him to throw his weight and celebrity status behind a movie like this rather than starring in some absurd \\"romantic comedy\\" with Jessica Simpson. For that, I commend him.    All-in-all, Black Snake Moan was a very enjoyable movie that tackled a variety of different subjects in an appealing yet controversial way. It'll be interesting to see how it stacks up when Oscars season comes around.
6305907145|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this movie. While the characters are different from the book, the plot is essentially the same. The literary Fanny is, to put it bluntly, a \\"drip\\" and the literary Edmund is a sanctimonious prig. The Fanny in the film is bright, sardonic, and literary-minded, much like the young Jane Austen, while still being high-minded and loving. This Edmund, while still being serious and with a vocation for the church, is more capable of having fun. One can see why they're together. In the book, I couldn't.
B000003S0F|4.0|The pre-Bruford/Wetton-era of Crimson was not exactly a steady band. Other than Robert Fripp, only lyricist Peter Sinfield had lasted by the time the group released Islands at the end of 1971 on Island (beginning of 1972 in the States on Atlantic Records), and even Sinfield would jump ship after this album to be replaced by ex-Supertramp member Richard Palmer-James (who would handle the lyrics for the Bruford/Wetton-era). Gordon Haskell and Andy McCulloch from the Lizard lineup was now gone (Haskell recorded a solo album in 1971 on Vertigo, and McCulloch teamed up with ex-Rare Bird organist Graham Field to form Fields, and then later with ex-Web/Samurai vocalist/keyboardist Dave Lawson and bassist Tony Reeves and keyboardist Dave Greenslade - both ex-Colosseum - to form Greenslade).    Mel Collins surprisingly lasted this long, and new members included future Bad Company bassist Boz Burrell, and drummer Ian Wallace. Boz also handled the vocal duties. Many Crimson fans and of course rock critics have hardly been kind to Islands. Many felt it was rather soft by Crimson standard, but if you put this up against any given Moody Blues album, this still has more edge, and in fact there's some cuts that are more aggressive than anything on Lizard. Many also disliked Boz's voice, but to me I really thought he did a good job, and he, for some reason, actually reminded me of Greg Lake. I guess that's the purpose, after all the band was having trouble with the vocalist department once Lake left. \\"Formentera Lady\\" is a nice opening cut, lots of pleasant flutes, plus I really love the use of sax in this piece. I often wondered if Jade Warrior was influenced by this cut, because it reminds me of what that group was also doing? \\"Sailor's Tale\\" is a much more aggressive piece with jazzy drumming from Wallace, plus some really dramatic Mellotron passages. I have to let you know the Mellotron had been used considerably less than on album's passed, Fripp was getting frustrated with themechanics of the instrument (he wasn't the only one, look at Tony Banks and Rick Wakeman), and from what I understand, he sold his Mark II to Genesis around this time (but then Fripp used the newer Mellotron 400 for the Bruford/Wetton-era albums). \\"The Letters\\" starts off rather mellow, but then there's some aggressive passages, of course if this piece was longer, the band could really let it rip. \\"Ladies of the Road\\" is the one piece many people can live without. It isn't bad musically, but the lyrics are not unlike ELP's \\"Taste of My Love\\" from their forgettable Love Beach album. \\"Prelude: A Song of the Gulls\\" is an orchestral remake of a piece from the Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles & Fripp album from 1968 (as you know, Fripp's pre-Crimson project whose two other members became Crimson members). Then comes the title track which is a very mellow closing piece, and quite mellow by Crimson standards. Really, this album isn't as bad as its reputation although I have to admit the album is a bit uneven, it's still worth getting.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|As a fan of psychological thrillers, I came to this movie with high expectations. I knew it was based on a true story, on actual files from the case. I also knew that I lived as an infant with my parents in the Zodiac's \\"territory\\" during the time of his first crimes. These elements only increased my interest.<br /><br />Once again, David Fincher creates a masterful film. The direction is sparse. The violent scenes are believable yet not gratuitous. The suspense is palpable as those trying to decipher the killer's clues become involved deeper and deeper, some of them losing perspective, jobs, and family. The acting is without equal throughout, with a cast highlighted by the performances of Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr, and Mark Ruffalo. A few scenes in particular--the nighttime car-ride on the highway; the basement confrontation; an interview at a factory--produce chills with their understated elements.<br /><br />\\"Zodiac\\" is long, but richly textured, and well worth it for those who enjoy a thinking thriller. It comes to an open-ended yet satisfying conclusion.
1400032717|5.0|I was pretty skeptical about this book before getting started. But I was surprised at how quickly I found myself really getting into it. I know there's no major plot, but besides Christopher being autistic and his parent being separated (or estranged), this is still a fairly average family you're reading about with lots of average family problems.     I cried really hard at the end of this book. It was one of those happy/sad cries. I honestly don't know how a person couldn't feel like crying at the end.

B000GGSM7G|4.0|I honestly don't understand why this album is so widely panned.  I think it's brilliant.  The stylistic differences in the tunes only make me like it more, not less.  The only track I could live without is ironically, the most commercial-The Caterpillar.  I don't care for that one and it's the reason I only gave this album 4 instead of 5 stars. My favorite tracks are Dressing Up, Empty World, Wailing Wall and The Top.  Those are some of my very favorite Cure tracks and I never tire of listening to them.  I'm not terribly fond of the bonus disc on this one either.  I think it's less interesting than the previous ones.  That said, I highly recommend this one for anyone wanting some very bleak, angry, disturbing yet very creative music.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|To be known anywhere in the world with just a first name mentioned, makes you realize that Barbara Streisand is an icon of her profession.<br /><br />After purchasing this CD I was pleasantly surprised with the selection on the CD where Barbara follows the viewer through the entire movie with interesting comments and insider information. Barbara's comments make you realize that she is sincere and dedicated to her audience.
B000GGSM76|3.0|Though I love this album, it's not one of my favorites.  Kyoto Song and The Blood are the only two tracks that excite me.  As far as the bonus disc is concerned, Innsbruck alone is the standout cut, a worthwhile listen.  It's the one tune on that disc I never seem to tire of.  It sounds like a definite throwback to the Faith-era Cure-very mysterious and haunting. It's really kind of out-of-step with the rest of the material.  A good album, but not one I'd recommend to a novice Cure listener.
B000002L9J|5.0|Truth be told, great as they all are, the Smith's albums don't really each have an individual 'sound' that differentiates one cd from another.  The reason 'The Queen is Dead' stands out even from the sublime standards of the rest, is that nearly every song is a classic. The songs here, in particular 'There is a light', perfectly showcase the band's unique genius for expressing sexual and emotional yearning, frustration and despair in a way that is both poetically devastating and yet oddly disarming and uplifting. These songs are, on paper, enough to have anyone slitting their wrists, yet in the charming humor that Morrissey inevitably throws in, or in a jangly riff from Marr, there is somehow an innocent working-class hope and dignity retained in it all to actually make you feel better listening to these tracks.  Someone, somewhere will always know what you're going through, and that person will forever be Morrissey.  Songs, indeed, that will save your life.
B000679N96|5.0|about this album.  With the exception of Foxy Lady, it's mint.  It's always been one of my favorite Cure albums.  The title track, along with Another Day really make the album for me.  I like the rich imagery of both of them.  Robert's the unrivalled master of writing rich, evocative, mood-setting tunes.  There isn't anything else I could say about this album that hasn't already been said.  This era(77-83) has long been my favorite and TIB is a great representation of it.  Long Live The Cure-the best band ever.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is the best show I have ever seen. Strongly recommended for the ones who is not shocked by blood scenes.
B000VBJEFK|4.0|I loved this movie, as an adult taking my 4 year old, it was a delight.  Great story line, graphics are awesome and it kept you entertained throughout, very fast paced.  The only reservation I have is the rating the movie received of \\"G\\".  I say this because early on the movie there was a scene in which Violence was used in the form of a \\" shotgun \\" in an attempt to kill rats, in which this movie are actual characters!.  I don't approve of violence in any form for my kids, although my kid took it in stride(I hope).  The scene was scary enough though that some children were frightened and crying in the theater.  Anyway, if your kid likes movies like Shrek, then this is very good for them, just not for anyone very little.

B000002G7E|5.0|The Velvet Underground-White Light/White Heat *****<br /><br />The Velvet Underground as it has been said tons and tons of times are one of the greatest and most important bands of all time. They recorded three of the greatest albums of all time and a final fourth album while not as classic is a great rock n' roll album non the less. This album showed and really introduced a new side to the band which we didn't really know existed. Lou Reed really took over the band at this point writing almost all of the lyrics, and most of the music. The Velvet Underground became Lou Reeds backup band. Proto-punk was introduced here, jazz was brought mainstream slightly anyway, stripped down rock and roll was starting to make a comeback and it all started with this album. Nico was now out of the band and trying her luck at a successful but short solo career and the band fired Andy Warhol as their manager and producer.<br /><br />The title track to the album, 'White Light/White Heat' is one of the best songs the band ever recorded, and even managed to inspire David Bowie. I'm sorry but if you manage to inspire David Bowie, the person who inspires everyone else then you have created something special. The song was punk ten years before the whole movement even broke in New York and London. Think about it all the punks came from New York in America at first and The Velvet Underground was New York, talk about important. 'The Gift' is a spoken word track that clocks in at 8:16 and while the music in the back is good the poetry does become lost. It is a great set of lyrics but in Reeds rambling he trails of and mumbles. 'Lady Godivas Operation' is a nice little song. 'Here She Comes Now' would have been a shoe in for the debut album. 'I Heard Her Call My Name' is a great little rocker that really showed what was to come from Reed in the future, especially in his solo career during the 1970's. The album closes with what could be the very best thing Reed ever recorded with or with out The Velvet Underground. 'Sister Ray' which closes the album is an outstanding 17:27, sound outrageous, well it is but not how you think, this is out radius because the song never lets up and never becomes boring. Truly the perfect way to end the album. The lyrics are phenomenal and the performance in general is just amazing.<br /><br />White Light/White Heat depending o the person is either the greatest album The Velvet Underground ever made or it is quite simply the worst and was a major misstep. Well personally I don't think that White Light/White Heat is the best album the band ever made I think the self titled The Velvet Underground was the bands best album, then this, then the debut & Nico, and finally Loaded. This is a very important rock n' roll album that all rock n' roll, punk, and alternative fans alike should own. Essential.ound.

0786177888|5.0|This book was required reading by a Jewish teacher in my 8th grade English class, in Brooklyn.  Being a know-it-all Black girl from Brooklyn, I never wanted to read it because I thought I knew it all.  Fast forward 10+ years and I finally read the book as a semi-adult.  Fast forward 10+ more years and I read it AT LEAST twice a year.  This is, in my opinion, the best book for any young woman to read, EVER.  It made me read everything else that Betty Smith wrote.  It makes me check my local library's supply to make sure they have adequate copies for other young (or older, wiser) girls to read.  I have searched and found a 1st printing of the book and I hold it more dearly that my most profound treasure.  I would suggest this book to anyone that can read.  It will surely teach you something about love, sacrifice and the complexity of the human heart.  It is full of romantic love, child-parent love, hopes, dreams, fears, innocence, everything!  I recently purchased the movie and I've watched it at least 15 times already.  This is a really good book.  Oprah thinks so too; she lists it as one of the few books that changed her life.  I wholeheartedly agree.
B000GG4XHO|5.0|Lou Reed-Coney Island Baby *****<br /><br />Coney Island Baby may be the very best thing that Lou Reed ever recorded with or without The Velvet Underground. Released right after the failure of his only bad solo album, whos name I wont even type Coney Island Baby is Reeds most peronal and beautiful album ever. He was given a second chance by his record company and he was in love with a transvestite which already made for an interesting album. This was the first but certainly not the last time that Reed would fall in love and record a polished album becuase of it and sing in a real radio friendly voice.<br /><br />As mentioned before the songs are Reeds most personal only The Blue Mask can compare with passion felt in one of his albums. 'Crazy Feeling' 'Shes My Best Friend' and 'Coney Island Baby' are so autobiographical it makes you want to cry when you hear Reed sing the songs. 'Kicks' is an extended jam that is very cool it reminds me of the bridge to 'Cant You Hear Me Knockin' by The Rolling Stones. As always the subject matter in one way or another finds a way to tie back to Reeds beloved city, New York. When a person spends their entire career singing about the same thing in one form or another you think that you wold grow old and tired of the artist well not with Reed and not when the subject is such a broad topic as New York is, and that is exactly what the title track of the album does, it ties everything Reed has ever sang about up to that point and made it all come together and make since with that one track. Songs like the self sure 'Gift' and 'Charleys Girl' show a pure cockey side of Reed that because it is him comes across as cool more then it does cockey. As the album comes to a close it leaves you wanting more which is odd for Lou Reed album because his albums usualy leave you fulfilled at the end but this one if so good that when it is over you dont want it to stop.<br /><br />The new reissue of the album comes with six additional songs as bonus tracks after the original album has ended. 'Nowhere At All' 'Downtown Dirt' 'Leave Me Along are all songs that could have been placed on the album originaly and would have fit in perfectly making this already brilliant album even better.Then three alternate takes of 'Crazy Feeling' 'Shes My Best Friend' and the title track 'Coney Island Baby' are what closes the cd. These add something more to the overall greatness of the album because they show you what Reed started out with on those songs and where he went with them until he was satisfied.<br /><br />Coney Island Baby is an album that people enjoy who dont even like Lou Reed. This the one to own if you ask me. Transformer is good but CIB in my opinion owns that album. The Blue Mask, Berlin, and New York are the only album Reed released that even compare to this album and even then they fail and miserably at that.album has ended.

B00006LLOG|5.0|Lou Reed-Transformer *****<br /><br />Next to The Velvet Underground & Nico, Transformer is the most popular album that Lou Reed ever lent his tme and name to. While many will tel you that Transformer is the very best album Reed ever made as a solo artist that is just not true. This is a great album and easily one of his best, but not the best. This is a glam rock triumph. Produced by David Bowie and the unsung guitar God Mick Ronson Transformer is on the same plain as The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Startdust And The Spiders From Mars, only not as good or as revolutionary.<br /><br />The power of Reed on this album is amazing though. His guitar playing along side that of Ronson is something for the ages. His songwriting is another feet in itself. Some of his most personal and heartfelt lyrics are here like 'Perfect Day' and 'Satellite Of Love. THe poetic side of Reed comes across the finish line with a gold medal. Song like 'Andys Chest' and 'I'm So Free' are pure poetic justice. Other tracks like 'Goodnight Ladies' 'Hangin Round' and 'New York Telephone Conversation' are so New York it isnt even funny. songs like 'Make Up' and 'VIcious' are about as early 70's glam rock as you can get without being David Bowie or Roxy Music. 'Vicious' as it is so appropriatly titled is one of the strongest tracks in Reeds Cannon.<br /><br />Now, 'Walk On The Wild Side' is one of the strangest, coolest, and greatest songs in all of rock n' roll. Not to mention importnat. This is Reeds ode to Transexuals in New York. This became Lou Reeds biggest and really his only hit single. 'Wild Side' help to propell this album to commecial success and make Reed the legend he is today.<br /><br />As a whole there really is nothing wrong with this album, every song is a great one. You couldnt find something wrong with this record if you tried, but as good as all of that sounds this album does however fail in comparison to the other great albums by Reed such as Berlin, New York, Coney Island Baby, and The Blue Mask. But for someone who is a new fan to Reed this is the perfect place to satart because it will really tell you if you like Lou Reed or not, beside it contains 'Walk On The Wild Side' which is essential in itself.<br /><br />As the original album ends there is two new tracks added to the end. An alternate version of 'Hangin Round' and 'Perfect Day' both of which are great version and make a nice addition to this already wonderful album.e who is a new fan to Reed this is the perfect place to satart because it will really tell you if you like Lou Reed or not, beside it contains 'Walk On The Wild Side' which is essential in itself.

6302886228|5.0|A masterful homage with too many highlights to mention. Worth any price for Richie Haven's Just Like a Woman, Johnny Winters Highway 61,Eddie Vedder, Neil Young and the first few bars of Knocking on Heaven's Door. Sinead O' Connor's defiant tribute to the \\"other\\" Bob by speaking \\"War\\" a capella was courageous and to be respected. All she did was dare to criticise the Pope, the leader of a church who have perpetuated centuries of oppression of women. The boneheads who booed her were ignorant cowards. So much for the land of the free and the home of the brave. By the way, the decision to sell the concert as dvd is not sony's. It is up to Bob. So who knows when, or if.
B000002G7G|5.0|The Velvet Underground *****<br /><br />Easly the best Velvet Underground album ever! This is what I think of first when I want to listen to the band. It is sutble and yet in your face at the same time. The album as a whole is very laid back musicaly and performance wise but as far as content and subject matter and theme, this is one in your face rock n' roll album. This is the first album since John Cale left the band but really despite what some people may say Lou Reed already had controle of the band on the second album White Light/White Heat. This is stunningly beatiful, and is to me the most important album and realy the best album of the 1960's. The nerve of Lou Reed never fails to amaze me. THe things he writes and sings about, the taboo and starical material was never before, during or since done better then by Reed himself.<br /><br />Cale was gone but so what. Forget his electric Veiola. Sterling Morrson suplies great  guitar to the album and Doug Yule makes for a fine addition to the band as proven with his vocals to the opening track 'Candy Says.' Maureen Tucker also is a vital part to the album as her percussion it essential to most of the album.<br /><br />Songs like the beautiful 'Candy Says' 'What Goes On' 'Pale Blue Eyes' 'Jesus' and 'After Hours' are among the greatest things ever written by Lou Reed. They are so inspired and true that it is hard to say anything other then this is the band best album. 'Pale Blue Eyes' is just stunning and is nothing short of incredible every time your hear it. The guts it must have taken to release 'Jesus' must have been massive, but then again it is Reed so he does what he wants anyway. 'Some Kinda Love' is a hidden gem in the album, which is a shame because while this track is often overlooked it is truly one of the bands all time best songs.<br /><br />The Velvet Undergrounds third selftitled album is easly the bands best as previously mentioned. No other album by the band can compare. The wonderful thing about the band is that all four of their albums are different so that you really cannot compare a single one.

B00005JPD0|5.0|Denzel Washington seems to know how to choose the right scripts.  This movie is so intense--and convoluted--it really makes you think in order to keep up.  Together with a great cast, he puts this one over and makes it believable.  It meets our criteria of \\"clean entertainment\\" and is a great addition to our home collection.  We got it from Amazon fast and in super condition--as usual.
B000002LKF|5.0|It's great that an American born artist has found a perfect blend between his music , brasilians and africans..the result is a delicious cd..one of the best i ever listened.<br />Milton Nascimento has his participation on this cd and other brasilians artists/bands as Uakti and Oludum...
B00008OE4W|5.0|My husband and I are always on the lookout for movies that we both like, as well as our adult children, who like to have occasional movie nights at our house--movies that are not full of profanity or lewdness or terrible violence and are immensely enjoyable.  This is a tricky combination to satisfy.  We saw \\"Sneakers\\" recently on TV and realized how really clever and fun a movie it is--definitely one that filled the above criteria.  When we decided to try to purchase the DVD for our collection, we went straight to Amazon.  How quickly we had this entertaining movie in our home!  It is in great condition.  We immediately planned a movie night and watched it (again).  Thank you for being there and doing such a great job of providing good stuff!
061891868X|5.0|What can I say? Like Lee Smolin, I too am a recovering mathematician, and this book helped me out the trap. I love mathematics and majored in it at university, but soon fell prey to the seductive sense of omnipotence comes with thinking that one can manipulate reality with equations. I give this book my highest recommendation, especially for those who have become demotivated by the crisis in science. One condition though - don't read it in isolation. Essential companions are Peter Woit's \\"Not Even Wrong\\", and my own book \\"The Virtue of Heresy - Confessions of a Dissident Astronomer\\".

B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|Sorry I expected this to be the best looking thing on my bravia. Grain and flickering throughout. I hear it was done on purpose to make the movie more gritty looking, bad idea.
B000TSIK14|3.0|Reference my review of \\"Unbreakable\\" to see how excited I was about Scorpions returning with an excellent effort. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about this recording. I knew I was in for trouble immediately when I saw the two words that are the kiss of death for any band \\"Desmond Child\\", on the back of this CD.    Where as \\"Unbreakable\\" saw Scorpions update their sound to the day's current environment with strong songs that only lacked grandiose solos, Humanity Hour 1 is made up of mediocre songs that are over produced and lack substance or any moments that grab you and hold onto you the way \\"Unbreakable\\" did.    On a positive note Klaus sounds great vocally.... but that's where it ends for this disc.
B00009W0U4|3.0|Very difficult to watch.  Some of the film was to dark to see the action.  Also, the spinning camara effects were difficult to take.  I like foreign films and am glad I purchased.  The violence in this movie does appear real and will shock.
0553584537|5.0|This was the first book I've read by Lisa Gardner and it was great!  Your attention is grabbed at the very beginning of the story and keeps up the pace until the conclusion.  I couldn't read it fast enough.   I have ordered some other books by her and hope they are just as good.  Full of suspense, mystery and intrigue - Just the way I like them.   Definitely 5 Stars!
B000001ELF|5.0|This is not only the best of the 4 solo albums (as everyones seems to agree), but this one still sounds as fresh and cutting edge today as it did back then.  Ace is the best!  The words 'eternally cool' come to mind.  I enjoy each and EVERY song so much here.  I don't think I can say that about all of the original albums by the entire band (and KISS is my fav alltime American band).  Can I say enough?  Even if you're not into KISS, but love classic rock/guitar rock--- you must own this one.  Side note:  My 4 yr old daughter heard Fractured Mirror yesterday and I didn't say who it was playing, she just looked at me and said 'Dad I really like that music!'  --- that's my girl!
B000PGTPE6|4.0|First, let me say that I have been a Springsteen fan since the 70s, and there is no way to really capture a Springsteen concert.  Second, I am generally not a big fan of \\"live\\" albums.    But this one is one of the few exceptions. I happened to catch some of the DVD on PBS (during a pledge drive.)  Based on what I saw I decided to buy, and actually went for the CD/DVD set for about $4.00 more than the CD.  I got it home and watched the DVD on a quality system and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Just watching the way Bruce performs is amazing.  It is so obvious that he enjoys performing, and is not afraid to share the stage with some amazing artists.      The set is not without its flaws, as one should expect with a live CD.  But its all there for everyone to see and hear.  No multiple takes, no do-overs.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|I actually have read several people saying he isn't any good or that he can't play guitar.  HMMM... I wonder what these people are thinking to write something like that.  Also, I don't like people bashing Roger Waters either.  Pink Floyd members have created some of the best music of our lifetime and we should appreciate each one of them equally.  I know everyone will have a favorite, but bashing just doesn't make any sense.  I happened to really enjoy seeing the band live in '94 without Roger, but wasn't it cool to watch them together again on the Live 8 show?  As far as this album goes, it's my favorite of ALL of the solo efforts from any member, and (to me) sounds more 'like Floyd' than any other recording.  Saying Dave can't play guitar (I play guitar myself so my opinion should count) is like saying Roger can't write meaningful lyrics--- that's not even silly.
B00001OH7P|5.0|A good friend in college turned me on to this selection. I had previously heard only Bowie's Space Oddity and knew hardly anything about him. Five Years got my attention, Soul Love gave me a taste, Moonage Daydream got me hooked. This is good stuff folks. That summer I went to see him perform the Diamond Dogs concert. He acted out every song (including Space Oddity w/that platform reaching out over the audience). The two young ladies I went with told me it was the best concert they'd every seen. Knowing I had seen and heard something special, I agreed. There are so many classic cuts on this CD, but none affect me more than Rock n Roll Suicide. Desperate times didn't seem so desperate after listening to this track. Although I didn't discover this album until the summer of '74 (thanks Cyndi!), without it I wouldn't have made it through that difficult time in my life. My second most favorite album of all time. If you read my other reviews, you'll know my first.
1594200823|5.0|I can't add any more than other reviewers except to say, \\"Read it!\\" Michael Pollen is a superb writer, and his insight leaves the reader with much to chew on. I find myself referring back to his chapters on corn and how much of our lives have incorporated corn and corn-based products often. My only quibble, very small, is his insistence that abstaining from meat for a month doth a vegetarian make, especially since he then goes wild-pig hunting. I expect most readers won't even notice this.
0671027344|5.0|Chbosky has revealed a great deal about youth and their problems, and does so sensitively and with empathy.   You have to read it closely because he weaves  his facts into the story so subtly that you might miss them.
006441034X|3.0|Good read by a good author of fantasy.  BUT, this book's storyline, characters & plot is not the same as the famous animae movie \\"Howl's Castle.\\"  I bought the book thinking it was a novel version of the movie's story and I was disappointed.  Jones has invented a new kind of Cindarella fantasy wizard-type story.  Though the storyline meanders, a few of the characters, especially the secondary characters, are vague, the book was worth reading.  Believe me, the settings, storyline, characters, plot, etc., are beautifully & fully fleshed out in the animae movie version.  Hayao Miyazaki is a genius!
0812975219|5.0|Hard to rate this book too highly.  It is not without flaws and even the author describes is as something along the lines of a self-indulgent and eccentric essay (my words).  That is of nonetheless part of its charm.  This is an unorthodox look at a very important topic for our world.<br /><br />It would be a mistake to come to this book as your first introduction to risk management, life, philosophy, probability or derivatives trading.  It covers all of those topics and much, much more but this book is not written as an introductory read.  You need to have some life experience and at least a working knowledge of risk management (in whatever field of endeavour you pursue).  The joy of this book is it's ability to stretch your mind with new ways of thinking.<br /><br />Taleb's fundamental premise is that we underestimate the role of luck (or Lady Fortuna) in our lives and he argues compellingly to that end with a range of interesting examples.  The survivorship bias of 'successful' people is well illustrated using a number of examples to show how (for example) derivatives traders start and fail on a regular basis, eventually leaving only the ones who have been continuously successful.  That although skill and experience are important, many wealthy trader have basically thrown 'heads' 20 times in a row (ie. survived 20 years trading).  We then back-test their methods to find the 'secret of their success' assuming that it is more than luck which of course it usually (but not always is) but that we for the most part a) underestimate the role of luck and b) assume that what has worked in the past will continue to work in the future.  He uses the black swan example (all swans were white until the discovery of black swans in Australia in the 17th century) to illustrate the point that even if the processes that trader has used in the past worked out, we need to keep challenging our thinking and continually learn anew.  In a complementary but very different vein, have a look at 'Managing the Unexpected' by Karl Weick and Kathleen Sutcliffe.  They give new meaning to the concept of mindfulness and how 'high reliability organisations' such as nuclear aircraft carriers use a 'Pre-occupation with Failure' to sustain mindfulness and avoid Black Swans.<br /><br />Some reviewers seem to have found Taleb's style challenging (and yes he can be sarcastic) but overall I loved it and found it a compelling read.  I have a Masters in Risk Management, trade options, help clients with risk management and international security solutions and am a better practitioner now for having read this shotgun blast of scattered but linked ideas.  I thoroughly enjoyed the places that it took and continues to take my thinking and am just grateful that he took the time to share his thought with the rest of us.<br /><br />Mandatory reading for anyone who manages risk (which is after all just about everyone).

1881273989|5.0|I think there are very few books out there that literally anyone could benefit from.  Singles, couples, kids, anybody.  I recommend this book a lot, if nothing else just for the sheer value of people becoming more aware of their relationships.    I know my parents marriage was in part saved by this book and some of the deeper understanding it brought them.  If it were up to me, there would be a copy on every book shelf.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) have an adopted daughter named Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) who begins suffering from severe night terrors and dangerous sleepwalking episodes.  The doctors tell the couple that their daughter is going insane, but Rose will not accept that diagnosis.  She decides to take Sharon to the one place that she keeps mentioning in her sleep, Silent Hill.  Supposedly Silent Hill was abandoned years ago because of an ever-burning mine beneath the city, but Rose decides to take Sharon there anyway.  After getting in an accident with a woman police officer (Laurie Holden), Rose awakens to find that Rose has disappeared and wondered into Silent Hill.  The place is eerie and disturbing.  Rose searches high and low to find Sharon, but when the sun goes down she discovers that there are monsters everywhere.  In the times of light Rose and the police officer, Cybil, learn that the people still living in the city take refuge in the town church when the Darkness and monsters come.  As Rose learns, though, things aren't exactly black and white and that in Silent Hill your best bet is taking a path down a road of grey.<br /><br />SILENT HILL is slightly better than the average horror-suspense movie, with two elements in particular that allow it to stand out.  The first is the music.  SILENT HILL has some of the creepiest music I have ever heard in a film.  Listening to just a few strains early in the movie was enough to give me the willies.  The other element that stood out for me in the movie were the monsters.  The structure of the movie is set up so you know exactly when the creatures are going to come out:  sirens blare, crows fly, and the sky turns dark.  Despite those warnings, the monsters of Silent Hill are still horrifying enough to frighten just about anyone.  They move at a regular pace, but with almost unnatural movements that seem like some grotesque ritual.  I later learned that the reason for this is that dancers were mostly hired for those roles.<br /><br />Even though I found SILENT HILL to be a better than average horror-suspense movie, I didn't enjoy it all that much.  It suppose it worked the way it was intended to, because I was left with some disturbing feelings and images after seeing it; the movie truly frightened me.  However, there was just too much unnecessary gore and violence for my tastes, especially during the last twenty-minutes of the movie.<br /><br />SILENT HILL is a movie that fans of the horror genre will probably appreciate most.

B000BNI90O|5.0|Covers the entire movie with all the music.     Wish I would have not bought the sound tracks and bought this first.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This album is truly a masterpiece. I'm rarely so complimentary of any musician or author, but this CD will blow you away. John Mayer is incredibly talented and you will not regret the purchase of this album. Most of the tracks on this CD are gems, but esp. Waiting for the World to Change, I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You), Belief, Slow Dancing in a Burning Room, and In Repair. These songs just might become the soundtrack of your life. They are beautiful and humble and eloquent. Enjoy them.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Loved the movie so much I bought this cd and the music is breath taking!  I'm actually using the cd for music while people are being seated at my wedding in Oct!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Personally, I'm glad they're putting out Tarantino's part of Grindhouse out separately and first....aside from the faux trailers, it's the only part of the movie I liked. I didn't really care for Rodriguez' Planet Terror and now I get the extended uncut version of the part I did like. It's a win/win for me.    WAR DEATH PROOF!!! Kurt Russell rules...and so does his skull hooded Nova!
6305907145|5.0|So often Austen movies are mis-cast and the characters you loved become just annoying.  I think this movie was cast great.  I realize that some liberties were taken, but I thought the tone was great.  It moves fast, and Fanny Price is given more life than the book did.  It makes her out to be a little bit more like Austen herself would be in my immagination.  When so many of the other movies have blown it (by casting too old, too stupid, too mean etc,) this movie got a lot of things right.  It made me want to read the book again which was probably a good goal for them.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|this is best thermal compound out there! it decresed my cpu temp by 5 degrees!
B000002GA8|5.0|This album might feature the prettiest vocal melodies you've ever heard.  Every single one of them is great, and really moves me in a way most people can't.  Honestly, they move me in a way Yes was never able to (\\"Gates of Delirium\\" being an exception).  While I could have done without all the spoken sections, I guess they add up to tell a nice story.  Of course I wish the spoken parts were changed into singing parts instead, but I can't have everything.  One thing that truly fascinates me about this album is how the vibe has an alarmingly memorable feeling about the whole thing.  Maybe it's the orchestra giving off highly unusual fairy tale-like feelings, I don't know.  It's pretty special though.  Even though I wasn't born when the record was released, I can almost feel myself being somewhere near this performance.  Something about the orchestra.  The album has a really special atmosphere.      The jamming bits are tucked between the vocal melodies, and kept nice and short.  They're actually played with lots of melody and special consideration.  Yes, you can tell it's a 70's album, but sometimes dated music can be spectacular despite some dated sounds, and this album is solid proof of that.  I also don't think this is a childrens album.  Sure, it's probably easy for kids to get into, but adults can like it just as much and not have to feel guilty about it.
0061150142|4.0|Jodi Picoult is and excellent author. I enjoy her books. This book could have used a bit more development of Emily's character. I felt like I wanted to know Emily better through out the book.
0596101996|5.0|This is the best explanation I have seen about javascript that doesnt read like a document.  Remember that other reviewers who have complaints are complaining about the 4th edition of the book. 5th edition doesnt have the lackings of the previous edition. My only suggestion is that the concepts could have been explained using many more diagrams especially with regard to execution context.
B000OVLBF8|5.0|The movie is a bit simple in story, but the special effects are well done. Nicholas Cage does this part very well, I can't imagine anyone else doing it.<br /><br />Hope they do another film !
B00005KAQP|5.0|What a riot! A black cabaret motown singer witnesses her boyfriend killing someone - 'I've never seen a dead guy before!  - I mean, you see the odd body on the freeway, but that's it'. She ends up under witness protection at a convent. She is predictably bored with the monastic life, but soon finds her niche - taking over the dilapidated choir. She fuses religion with the spirit of motown and gets the nuns singing. They prepare for a visit of the pope - but the mob are also on her trail. Which will prevail in the swinging and thrilling musical climax?
B00007K02F|2.0|After reading the book Jane Eyre, I decided to watch every remake of the film that I could find - at least half a dozen. By far the best is the newest one with Rochester as Toby Stephens (what a marvelous flirtatious exchange between Rochester and Jane); another favorite is the Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke production. But this one with William Hurt (who I always liked as an actor) is so bad that it makes me cringe.<br /><br />There is absolutely no chemistry or romance conveyed between Charlotte Gainsborgh and William Hurt; I could not feel or believe that they loved each other. The performances of both fall flat, flat, flat. I find myself even wondering if the two actors did not even like each other or connect in real life but felt compelled, due to signing their contracts, to play the role of lovers. But neither succeeded in summoning up any real feeling - it just doesn't work!<br /><br />Joan Plowright is excellent as always, and Charlotte Gainsborgh does make a believable Jane Eyre, but there is no real fire in her, and as a result her outspoken moments feel heavy, as if she were depressed and exhausted and pretending to an energy she does not possess.<br /><br />Another complaint about the film, probably not obvious to those who haven't read the book, is that the story is distorted and about 1/3 of it omitted. What happened to Jane's fleeing of Rochester and landing at the home of strangers whom take her in and with whom she lives for half a year? Perhaps because of time limitations, Sintjen's role was altered in this film, and the fire was portrayed as Jane was leaving Rochester, and not many months later.<br /><br />In any case, if you're going to watch one version of Jane Eyre, I highly suggest it not be this one!
B00005JPLW|5.0|One of the best movies that I have seen.....excellent example for art of war and leadership values!    Arath Palomera
B000OY8NII|5.0|I loved this show from the moment I watched the Pilot!  The diversity of the characters, the story arcs, just unique and unusual enough that it keeps you coming back for more.<br /><br />I'm glad the SciFi Channel brought it back for another season, even if it's only for 13 episodes.<br /><br />For you eco-friendly people, you will be happy to know that the packaging is made from recycled paper, even the disc holder is paper, not plastic!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I got this CD when it first came out and did not care much for it because it wasn't what I expected.  I was also young at the time and thought that the only good metal had cussing in it.  I listened to this CD about a year later to see what I didn't like about it.  I listened to it and loved it.  It is true that this CD grows on you.  I think it is easily the best CD they have made and I still play it when ever I need to wake up.
1558908374|1.0|Glenn Close is in this film and she is, as usual, excellent.  So, why did I absolutely hate it?  Well, Michael Caine put it so well, in words similar to these, \\"Stop doing remakes, unless the original was terrible\\".  The original One Hundred and One Dalmations was sublime.  When I watched this remake, all it did was remind me of the original. I was 11 years old, when I saw it, I am 57 now; and I still love it.  My children were brought up on it and my dog jumps up n the sofa, when he hears the first twilight bark and he never moves until it's over (I know he,I, or both of us are pathetic).  I am sure that this remake is not a bad film, it is probably quite good.  But it's like comparing a beef liver with Foie Gras - No competition!  The great sadness is that Disney do not realise what they have.  They need to re-release the original (It would certainly cost them less) and educate a whole new generation into animation perfection.  Until that moment arrives, I sincerely hope that you enjoy this remake.  Get a copy of the original if you can.  And let the dog on the sofa.
B000GTJT0M|1.0|A lot of people here seem to like this movie, I am not one of them. I got this as one of the five films you get via coupon for buying a HD DVD player, and at free it is not worth the price. The concept is great, but the plot is silly and disjointed, the acting sucks (yes I am talking about Gwyneth Paltrow in particular). It just left me flat. A concept that could have worked well turns out to be just a mess in execution. At least they tried something different.
0743496728|3.0|I have read two books by Jodi Picoult, The Tenth Circle and Nineteen Minutes, and I don't plan to read any more of them.  In both books, the characters seem exaggerated to the point of being caricatures.  They're just not believable as real people.  Also, in both books, there is a plot twist at the end which I found completely out-of-character and unrealistic, with very little explanation given by the author.
6300213129|4.0|This episode is sometimes difficult to watch for anyone who has ever been a teenager, especially a teenage boy. But it has a good premise, well executed. More than just a \\"troubled teen\\" episode, this one is about a 17-year boy (Robert Walker) who has had almost no experience interacting with his own species when he first comes aboard the Enterprise.<br /><br />In the first half, Kirk has to be a reluctant father figure. It rounds out Kirk's character to see him in this role, for later he was mainly the dashing captain saving the galaxy and wooing alien babe forms. Star Trek II and III dealt with him in a father's role, but in a more superficial manner. He is not bad as a father but not perfect, either.<br /><br />Charlie was the sole suvivor of a planetary expedition 15 years earlier, and aliens gave him godlike powers so he might survive. Now he has to interact with humans, but he can't resist using his powers whenever he is frustrated, which is often. This episode is a little like the famous Twilight Zone entry \\"It's a Good Life\\" in which a 6-year-old boy torments a community with his godlike powers. How he got those powers is unimportant. It was hypothetical: IF a child had godlike powers, then life would become a nightmare for all around him.<br /><br />This is a good episode for Grace Lee Whitney as Janice Rand, who has a large role. Charlie's teenage hormones kick into gear when he sees her for the first time. It doesn't help that in the original series, women wore those incredible mini-skirts. The writing is a little non-PC: \\"Is that a girl?\\" \\"That's a girl.\\" Maybe Kirk should've answered: \\"No, Charlie, that's a full-grown woman.\\"

0385732554|4.0|My son bought The Giver at a bookstore. After he read it he asked me to read the book because he thought it was not only a fascinating story, but very educational. I wasn't sure I really wanted to read a teen book at first, but once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in one day, and I'm sorry to say but my family had to fend for themselves when it came time for dinner.     Lois Lowry does such an excellent job of describing his characters, especially Jonas, and the city where everything is controlled. This is a great read for middle school students through adults. I would gladly recommend it to all my friends.
B00005M989|1.0|This compilation cd of hits is despicable. It's not even half the hits that he put out. Me, myself, I was born at during the time of Purple Rain circa 1983. My mom was a fan and listening to Prince while cleaning the house, I myself became a fan. So if you really want to rock out, get dirty and sexy then you need to not buy this one. BUY the Hits 1 and 2 and B-sides. Those are well worth the money.
B000000QFY|4.0|So, this is the album that late night FM radio staple \\"Hocus Pocus\\" original appeared on. Another lesser-known band that I haven't gotten around to looking into. 'Moving Waves' first came out in 1971, I remember this tune when I was in junior high. Still holds the test of time. This progressive / art rock Dutch band's main asset appears to be guitarist Jan Akkerman. Tunes here that had me playing this CD reissue over several times were the previously mentioned \\"Hocus Pocus\\", the beautifully written \\"Le Clochard\\" with \\"Janis\\" {the two seem to sort of run together} and the King Crimson {possibly} inspired twenty-three minute \\"Eruption\\". Should draw in long time fans of Gentle Giant, early Genesis, Camel and Jethro Tull. Well worth checking out.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Reminicent of The Parallax View, Wahlberg is framed by covert government operatives (led by Danny Glover) for a political assasination.  Wahlberg (looking more Matt Damon like) is a government agent whose special talent is as a shooter with a rifle that allows him to reach a target a mile away.  Wahlberg explains that there are many things that affect the shot from that distance such as wind, etc.  Glover approaches him saying that an assasination threat has been detected against the president and the government wants Wahlberg's expertise to tell them how the shooter will do it (they tell him that the shooter has Wahlberg's talent to be able to strike from a mile away).      Wahlberg scouts out the locations the president is to visit and tells Glover where he thinks it will happen and when.  They go to the location on the day the president arrives to supposedly catch the shooter before he gets to the president.  As this happens very early in the movie, it is fairly easy to guess that Glover is just using Wahlberg to perform the assasination himself and then blame Wahlberg.      Glover's plan to eliminate Wahlberg after the shooting fails and most of the movie after focuses on Glover and his corrupt government men trying to get Wahlberg before their operation is blown.    The movie has a lot of great action and makes the viewer think that going forward, no political leader may be safe from assasination if he could be easily hit from a mile away by someone with Wahlberg's gun.
0920668372|5.0|This such a great little book. I have only one daughter, and she is 15 now, but we remember reading this book, and we both cry. I cant get through this book without tearing up. Buy this book and read it with your children.....you will have a memory forever.
0393061310|5.0|Even though I never liked history, this book was truly delicious to read. It is written in a very simple and understandable way. As the cover says, its scope and explanatory power are amazing. It is one of the best books I have read so far.
B000065PUE|5.0|Doolittle is as good an argument as there is for simplicity in making music. They never get into complex structures or timing, they just make good rock music with a couple guitars, a bass, drums and a couple interesting voices. Kim Deal's pleasant femininity is a mellow counter to Black Francis' eccentric shouting, whispering, and laughing. He can still sing pretty normally when he wants too, though. It's a bit lo-fi, but better for it, as the lack of cleanliness in the production adds perfectly to the tone of the music. None of the songs are too long, with the 15 songs lasting less than a total of 40 minutes. They cut out all the fat and get straight to the essence of their sound, not a band for wasting time. It's definitely a strength of the album that it's so tightly focused. Deep, simple baselines and steady drums provide a backbone for alternating high-pitched and crunching guitar riffs. They often get into fast-paced, repetitive grooves that are as basely affecting as anything in music. They're usually a bit dark in tone, but can depart from that without sounding off. \\"Here Comes Your Man\\" sounds positively like surf rock, and \\"Mr. Grieves\\" has a reggae feel in the verse, but both still sound like Pixies.    \\"Debaser\\" starts it off perfectly, and is pretty much a microcosm of the band. \\"I Bleed\\" is slower paced, and uses Deal's vocals to great effect. Her voice has a haunting quality to it, and sets the mood for a lot of songs. \\"Monkey Gone To Heaven\\" has strange, spoken lyrics, string accompaniment, a great chorus and bridge, and might be the best of the album's many great songs. \\"Crackity Jones\\" is an awesome, very fast-paced song. \\"No. 13 Baby\\" is the longest track and given the most space to stretch out, which it manages to use well. \\"Silver\\" is another departure, which feels like a Western anthem. The dropping, picked guitar and forlorn vocals just brings the image of a duel with six-shooters in the dusty street to my head. \\"Gouge Away\\" is another nice song and brings it all home with the groovy verse and loud chorus. I didn't know music this old could be so good.

B000002UB3|4.0|The Beatles came together for one last effort and it's a monumental one except for a few glaring weak spots. \\"Abbey Road\\" begins with Lennon's funky \\"Come Together\\" which he stated is built on a riff by one of rock's founding fathers, Chuck Berry. George Harrison's majestic ballad \\"Something\\" follows. It's a remarkable achievement that shows just how much he'd matured as a songwriter when compared to the lame McCartney-penned \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", a silly ditty following the likes of \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" from \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and the somewhat rote \\"Oh! Darling\\" which Paul makes up for in his impassioned performance of the song. Ringo's composition, \\"Octopus's Garden\\" is also a bit weak in my humble opinion. It sounds like another take on \\"Yellow Submarine\\" but the kids should enjoy it. John's lyrically minimalist \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" is half hard rock, half slinky blues. It's a long number at almost eight minutes but it holds up well. The original take goes on longer but the released version is cut abruptly which is a good thing as the boys' tendencies to jam (off record-listen to \\"Let It Be\\"'s \\"Dig It\\" also) could be a bit much at times. This song ended the first side of the vinyl album.<br /><br />Side Two is comprised of eleven tunes, the last nine of which are edited as a suite and are worth the price of the album alone. Beginning with George's sublime \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" and John's \\"Because\\" with those shimmering, gorgeous harmonies; \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" which sounds like it was really co-written by John and Paul, follows. There are more exquisite harmonies on \\"Sun King\\". John handles lead vocals on the rockers \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\" before Paul takes over with \\"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window\\" and the lovely ballad \\"Golden Slumbers\\". The whole group sings \\"Carry That Weight\\" with Ringo's voice the slightly prominent one before each member has an instrumental solo on the fabulous \\"The End\\". It's a kick figuring out who is playing each bit. If you're at all familiar with the styles of John, Paul and George, you can pretty easily tell which is which and this is the only song that featured Ringo doing a solo bit. \\"Abbey Road\\" ends with the shortest piece the Beatles ever recorded- Paul's simple \\"Her Majesty\\".<br /><br />Though not my favorite record by the Fab Four (see my reviews of \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\"), \\"Abbey Road\\" is definitely an essential Beatles album to have.g out who is playing each bit.

B000QQH4YS|4.0|I love this film. It's one of my favorites and I've bought it several times. I even own the criterion version of this film and I bought this one, hoping that it would finally be the proper ultimate edition and include commentary from Peter Weller. Weller has done great commentary tracks for other films of his, like \\"Naked Lunch\\" and \\"OF Unknown Origin\\" and Robocop needs a Weller commentary. The DVD gets only 4 stars for again missing the oportunity to make this the final word of the film.
B00005R24K|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies, it rocked back in the day and it still does. the acting is good the makeup is good everything is great. it's a classic worth gold. bruce campbell and his team did a beautiful job. the setting is great, the horror, and you just have to watch it to understand. the whole thing takes place somewhere in the middle of some very creepy woods. it's all possessed, and the cabin where they stay is not as safe as it seems. they have to fight demons before they are taken over and it'll be to late. but once you're in there's no way out. and the two movies after this are just as good. i applaud this series.
0385341067|5.0|In \\"Mister Pip\\", Lloyd Jones weaves a narrative that will transform lives... in a voice that lives on long after the final page.<br /><br />During the 1990 blockade of Bougainville, a south Pacific island rich in copper, only one white man chooses to stay behind: the eccentric Mr. Watts, who sweeps out the ruined schoolhouse and begins to read to the children each day from Charles Dickens's classic Great Expectations. So begins this brilliant award-winning novel about the strength that imagination, once ignited, can provide. As artillery echoes in the mountains, thirteen-year-old Matilda and her peers are riveted by the adventures of a young orphan named Pip.<br /><br />A private, linen-suited figure with a native wife, Mr. Watts is a mystery to the children of the island But Matilda's fascination with the story of Pip begins to trouble her devout, practical-minded mother. She starts to wage a not-so-silent campaign against Mr. Watts and nineteenth-century England, and the distance between her and Matilda, who is immersed in the new world of Dickens, grows.<br /><br />Then the real war, which has been inching closer every day, arrives. The redskin soldiers visit the island and come to believe that Pip, the central character of Great Expectations, is a real, live man, being hidden by the villagers. Vengeance is extracted in increasingly terrible ways as the island fails to produce him. Yet as the villagers lose almost everything, for the children and Mr. Watts, the imaginary world exerts a stronger pull than ever. And for a moment, the power of story-telling seems as though it will save everyone.<br /><br />The narrator's voice is that of Matilda, a village girl. She was named by the Australians who opened up the world's richest copper mine in Bougainville, and her name stands throughout as ironic comment on responsibilities intimate and global. Lloyd Jones has a special insight into the intricacies of the human situation - intimate and global.<br /><br />Lloyd Jones, writing with the voice of an adolescent girl, is a middle-aged New Zealand author who has mastered a great novel: Wrought with the purity of grief, urgent in every cadence, and expanded by a faint lingering hope. But the end does not bring wonder but despair. And that's a wonder in itself, that such a grim subject can still carry something as luminous and as revealing to us readers worlds away from a forgotten village on the pacific.<br />This book  reminds me of the high;y acclaimed book [[ASIN:0978602420 Upland Road]] from AlpharPublish.com in that it explores the effects of a foreign civilization on children from a south pacific culture.<br />Enjoy the book!

B000000ZGO|3.0|I normally don't write negative reviews, and if I hadn't listened to this recently I would have agreed with all the superlative reviews, basically because that's how I remember this record too.<br /><br />But I just finished listening to this and.....<br /><br />(It's not that good.)<br /><br />By that I mean it's about as good as \\"Within You Without You\\" from Sgt Pepper.  Groundbreaking for its time, genre-shifting, radical, risk-taking, and exotic.<br /><br />But today, in 2007, can you say you really love listening to \\"Within You Without You\\"?  Or would you just rather wait for it to be over so you can hear \\"Lovely Rita\\"?<br /><br />This record has that same kind of feel.  Let's be honest -- the guitarist is mediocre at best, his leads are really just awful, especially when he searches for notes upward.  Although \\"Walk On By\\" has the reputation for being nasty funk, it's really very mild. The extended jams lack imagination, Isaac's organ keeps hitting the same two chords, the horns are repetitive and unimaginative.<br /><br />I like Isaac's singing, and the back-up singers sound pretty good.  But come on, that extended rap on \\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\\" is enjoyable today purely as kitsch, if that.<br /><br />I hate to say this, but this is a time capsule record, in a piece with legendary misfires like Muddy Waters' \\"Electric Mud\\" or Bo Diddley's \\"Black Gladiator.\\"  Good for a goof but don't expect James Brown or P-Funk grooves or performances here.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I knew if I held out and didn't buy any of the other editions that have come out on DVD that i would be rewarded.  We get it all here, the Pilot (US and UK Versions) Season 1 and 2, The Log Lady intros and even more bonus features, what more could you ask for.      To the person who complained about them not including Fire Walk With Me, well that is a completely seperate movie that is already out on DVD, there is no need to include it here.  Plus the TV series and the movie are owned by different studios.  I kept holding out for years, tempted to buy the import DVD and the most recently released US dvds, but i was holding out for a definitive box set, and it is finally here.  Can't wait to curl up in front of the TV this winter and enjoy this series from start to finish.

B000002J0P|5.0|I bought this on vinyl when it was originally released, I was seventeen at the time. My friends and I had been interested in playing guitar for sometime, but until CSN we had no interest in acoustic music. I remember being absolutely overwhelmed by the angelic nature of the harmonies and the guitar work of Stills. This album I believe awakened me to the real value of wooden guitars and as a result I was hooked. It gave me an interest in exploring country and folk music in a way that I hadn't done before. To this day I never pick up a guitar without remembering the days of listening to this music, learning the progressions, and seeing these three guys sitting on that couch out in front of Joni Mitchell's house. To listen to this again with the clarity and quality of the remaster is a great way to recall a better time in popular music when real talent was appreciated.

B000RJO578|5.0|Filmed by the geniuses behind Shaun of the Dead and the great tv show Spaced, still unavailable in America.  I highly recommend them both if you liked Hot Fuzz.<br /><br />This movie is an homage to some of the greatest mindless action films that came before it, as well as a fantastically entertaining action film.  This movie is incredible!  I saw this at the theater with two friends and we all came out happy and excited.  I bought it the day it was released.<br /><br />A supercop is sent from London to a bucolic town because he makes all the other police look bad.  He finds it stifling and boring.  He's ready to tear his hair out until some mysterious deaths get him asking questions.  He soon finds out that the deaths are all murders done to hide something, but what?  You will never, ever guess, but it's so funny that you will love the ride.  What other movie can you see that has an elderly woman being kicked in the face?
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This is the first Scorsese film I have really enjoyed since 1995's Casino.  All the performances are great, but the real standout here is Jack Nicholson's psychotic mob boss.  The documentary about the real life events upon which the movie was based are useful to viewers who want to find out more about the real life events that inspired certain things in the movie and with the documentary included I consider this edition to be the \\"complete\\" version of the film.

B000RE1RR4|5.0|This show has me hooked.  I didn't start watching faithfully until the third season and now I am downloading old episodes.  The chemistry that the cast has created is unique and captivating.  The Southern mix and LA attitude is humorous and very accurate.  I think TNT has a winner with this show.
0743454537|1.0|I skimmed the rest of the book in a few hours after reading the first few chapters. I agree with other reviewers who have mentioned annoyance at the font changes and stilted dialogue. Add to that, the addition of extra voices (the lawyer & guardian ad litem) added nothing to the plot line.  With regards to the actual content, I found it to be weak. This would have been a far more interesting ethical issue to struggle with had Anna been conceived \\"normally\\" or without planning. As it is, the issue of \\"is it moral to conceive a child solely to support the life of another child\\" is a no brainer. What sort of parent would force a child into that role? In fact, not only force her into that role, but conceive her solely for that role?  With that in mind, the rest of the story became only progressively more annoying. I had absolutely no sympathy for Sara, some sympathy for Brian, and felt that had Jesse's character been more well-rounded, it could have added a lot to the book. To top it off, the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. The author said something to the effect that books dealing with difficult issues have difficult endings. Well, this ending was not difficult - it was a complete and utter cop-out. What would have happened had this story been in real life? I can't tell you for sure, but I am pretty darn sure that it would not be the glib, saccharine ending we're given here.
0618680004|5.0|Anyone interested in even a casual introduction to modern freethinking (the \\"PC\\" term for atheism) needs to read this book. Dawkins' work is both complex and sublimely simple, gifted as he is at puting difficult concepts to paper.    There are low-ranked reviews here that were obviously written by the religiously compelled. Please ignore them. The kinds of people who spend their free time writing phony book reviews are the same that Dawkins trains his powerful intelectual microscope on- and this is all they have to fight back with.    Did atheism create Nazism? Were Stalin and Hitler atheists, and if so, was it responsible for their horrors?What's the harm in belief in God? These and many other compelling questions are addressed throughout the book.    If you have a critical mind and can think for yourself, please read this book. You will not be disappointed.

B00005JO5L|3.0|As others have said, this is a love-it or hate-it affair pretty much from \\"go.\\"  The plot of the film is confusing, the third act quite ludicrous, and the portrayl of leather gays coming quite close to homophobia.  That said, the film is a major Hollywood production dealing with a minority subculture (leather) with a great actor in the lead.  The music & sound design are quite good and cinematography is excellent.  Seeing the film decades removed from the scandal, what strikes one most about the film is its ambiance, something Friedkin is a master at.  An important if over-heated and under-though film.
B000Q6GXW2|4.0|This is a really good flick. A little cheesy at times, especially after the 2nd or third viewing. The sound is excellent. The PIP extra feature is also very cool. A recommended HD disc for your collection.
B000002UAU|5.0|What can I say? Rolling Stone's #1 Rock album of all time.    Maybe less appealing to Britney Spears-type listeners, this album was ahead of it's time in so many ways that I can't list here.
B000LC55F2|5.0|The Prestige is a story of rivalry and obsession, played out to the bitter end.  The central characters, a pair of illusionists, engage in a series of sabotage and oneupmanship that can never be satisfied until both are dead.<br /><br />The appearance of Nikola Tesla as a supporting character in the story, fits nicely within this allegory, serving as a reminder of that same obsessed rivalry between inventors Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison -- both \\"magicians\\" of their day.<br /><br />Just like a magic act, any good movie about magicians will have misdirection, and illusion, and a surprise at the end, and I certainly thought that The Prestige delivered on that.  Even when I was able to see a few of the surprises and misdirections, I was fooled by others, and satisfied at the end.<br /><br />After just one viewing, this movie has easily found its way into my top ten.
B000MXPE7Y|5.0|If you are an action-starved, CG-driven junkie .. ..<br /><br />THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU!<br /><br />A terrific, serious movie about the birth of the CIA and the sacrifices (intentional & unintentional) that America's most-dedicated warriors have to make to keep the world a safer place .. ..<br /><br />Definitely, not an exciting or pulsating piece, but riveting nonetheless .. ..<br /><br />I hope everyone will take from this an appreciation for the people of our intelligence sevices who serve so loyally for so little .. .. And, make the right calls 99% of the time so the most we have to worry about on a daily basis is whether LINDSAY LOHAN is back in jail .. ..
B000002I6T|5.0|I picked this record up because it was ridiculously cheap, .79 cents at the local goodwill. I honestly wasn't expecting much considering it was just in some heap of records. But this record is terrific, wonderful vocals and some really righteous guitar work. If your looking for a vinyl masterpiece this ought to be your choice. i don't know how it sounds digitally, but i'd have to recommend you get yourself a record player and throw this on immediately.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and had to have it.  It's not one of those unrealistic movies you always see where the hero lives on and the ending is all lovely. With all the fight scenes and pure action this movie brings it is a must see for any action fan. This movie by far is one of my favorite movies of the year and another great Frank Miller movie.  So if your a fan of his work you have to see this movie.
0385333846|5.0|As one of the most acknowledged anti-war novels of the modern day, Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five lives up to the recognition that it receives. The compelling anti-war story, published in 1969, is portrayed through Billy Pilgrim and his assortment of stories he reminisces upon throughout the novel. Vonnegut uses the zany Pilgrim to illustrate aspects such as life and death, time travel, and his supposed journey to the planet of Tralfamador.  The story is based around Billy Pilgrim, a World War II veteran who survived the Dresden bombing. Vonnegut sporadically takes the reader through different parts of Pilgrim's life, leaping between time periods and events. Pilgrim's inability to control his own mind creates an extremely nonlinear plotline split up into small groups of flashbacks in his life. His flashback consist of his recollection of his schooling at University of Chicago, his occupation as an optometrist, his voyage to the far away planet of Tralfamador, his daily life as a father of two and an average man, and his memories of war, most importantly his time as a prisoner of war.   Vonnegut uses these events to make deep statements about the destruction caused by war. During the chaos created by the erratic nature of the book, Pilgrim never fails to return to a common situation that he suffered during World War II. He often finds himself in a meat refrigerator, attempting to stay alive while the city above is suffering the fiery storm brought upon by the famous fire bombings at Dresden. This frequent recollection refers to the never ending destruction caused by war.   Pilgrim also finds himself being kidnapped by aliens native to the planet of Tralfamador. He is influenced greatly by the Tralfamadorians, and takes on their indifferent opinion about death. The aliens believe in the moment rather than the lifetime, creating this indifference, and they also make the reader doubt the truth about free will, and its nonexistence in life. Pilgrim's attitudetransformation finds his own free will taken away many times throughout the book. The exotic planet's overall attitude towards life also gives reason for the episodic structure of the book.   Embedded in the deep statements made by Vonnegut about war and life in general, there is a considerable amount of comedic irony, making the book an enjoyable experience to read. Vonnegut's messages throughout the book pertain to human nature and should not be ones which are passed over by anyone.  In my opinion, this novel will be read for many years to come because of Vonnegut's powerful messages about life. Slaughterhouse-Five was the first book that I have read by him, and I plan to read many more in the future. The novel is similar to Joseph Heller's Catch-22, so if you are into well used comedic irony in war stories, Slaughterhouse-Five will surely be one of your favorites (as well as Catch-22).
B000SO7OM0|5.0|I've been a fan for a couple of years now, since I discovered her on an internet radio station from Italy. Strange, huh? I had seen her CD's in the store but had to discover her on a foreign radio station.    Anyway, I'd always thought that she was excellent on the studio versions. I was blown away to hear the live versions! How many people do you know that sound as good as or even BETTER live versus in the studio? I've seen very few acts that can sing as well as they do on disk. With all of the technology out there like pitch correction software and the like I'm just stunned at how good she is live. Loreena also has some top-notch musicians backing her. I'll get my chance to see her live in October when she comes to NE Ohio. I can't wait. I'm sure it will be a surreal experience being that most of the shows I've seen (other than concerts by David Lanz & one by Brad Paisley) have been in the rock/metal genre. My sister just looks at me, shakes her head and wonders when I acquired a bit of \\"culture\\". ;-)    The acoustics at the Alhambra must have been something to behold because the sonic qualities of the DVD and CD's are wonderful. If you have a quality sound system (surround-sound) you'll especially love it. Get the DVD. You won't be disappointed. BTW, I bought this version, the other one comes in a DVD-style case but otherwise is identical.    UPDATE: I saw Loreena perform live last night in Cleveland and it was everything I had expected and more! What an amazingly talented lady!!! She can sing like an angel and has a band that you just can't believe until you see them live. The DVD got me primed but I wasn't sure what to expect as far as acoustics, live sound, etc. They were every bit as good as the Alhambra performances and it now becomes the best live performance (by far) that I've ever witnessed. If she comes to your city, go see her. It's woth every penny!
075640407X|2.0|It's hard to be too critical of The Name of the Wind, because there is a lot in there that is interesting. One thing that stood out for me was the slight obsession with currency. Finances are something that are routinely omitted from fantasy novels, but as Kvothe works his way up the income and prestige ladder it's kinda cool to have a real understanding of his financial situation, which adds an edge to the parts of his story where he is broke. I thought the imagining of magic in his world, the concept of Sympathy, was rather clever.    But at the end of the day, I didn't care for The Name of the Wind, and I think the problem is that Mr Rothfuss greatly overplays his hand. He sets up a world and a character in the first few chapters of the book, a world which is currently in crisis with all sorts of unexplained things happening. We are then introduced to this retired adventurer running a bar, and the idea is clearly to bring Kvothe out of retirement to help deal with the world's ills. To do that, for some reason we need to hear the entire story of Kvothe's life to this point. In excruciating detail.    So what we then get is 900 pages of back-story on the first, oh, 20 years of his life or so. Parts of the story are interesting, many are not. Some of the characters are interesting and very well-drawn, many are not. He goes through a flavorful and occasionally challenging existence and then has a short and marginally exciting adventure at the end. It's all a little ...  well, boring. No risk, no drama, no confrontation of difficult choices, no struggle to succeed, little real character growth ... all the ingredients of a basically uninteresting story. One of the reasons I liked the money element of the book is because it's used so efficiently - a little bit about how much he earned or spent or what things cost is slipped in easily from time to time and it cheaply adds depth, interest, and realism to the story. Sadly, virtually nothing else in the story is so clean, and the book never attains momentum or has much tension. The real killer is that the character of Kvothe is simply uninteresting. He wanders around, does a bunch of stuff, excels at virtually all of it, but he never  engages on a personal level, is never interesting enough to like, hate, or feel much of anything for.    What makes it irritating is all the foreshadowing. We know there is a huge amount of story left to tell. We have to make it through another couple volumes of this length to tell Kvothe's entire back story, and then we can start working on the here and now that was set up way back in the beginning of book 1. So we're staring down the barrel of maybe 5000 pages to tell the story Mr Rothfuss has envisioned. Which is, quite frankly, grossly excessive. None of the characters in here are interesting enough to sustain that kind of page count. If we're generous, there is barely - barely - enough plot to sustain just this one book, which is carried mostly by good writing and to a lesser degree by some modestly interesting characters. But I have no enthusiasm to follow them through another thousand or so pages, never mind multiple thousand-page volumes. They are modestly interesting. Not compelling. I doubt that anything that is drawn out to this degree could ever be that compelling.    What we needed here was an editor. Give me the best stuff of this entire envisioned world or series in three books of 300-400 pages each, and maybe we have something really good. Even better might be a collection of short stories with a novel in the middle or at the end. But The Name of the Wind creaks badly at 900 pages and does not give us enough to get emotionally or intellectually engaged in for this one book alone, never mind where Mr Rothfuss is apparently trying to take us.    Look, War and Peace was only about 1400 pages. Tolkien told the entire tale of the Lord of the Rings in less space than it takes Mr Rothfuss to tell this quarter-finished tale. People always joke about Charles Dickens being paid by the word, but The Tale of Two Cities is only 300 pages or so. Why do modern fantasy and sci-fi authors feel compelled to put so many word on the page? Are they so arrogant that they can't admit that not all of their ideas are worthy of printing? This is ridiculous. Mr Rothfuss clearly has writing talent, too bad his editor and/or agent couldn't force him to tell one interesting story and finish it before his readers lose interest.
B000O78KW4|5.0|If you are looking for a movie that is filled with hard hitting action, Die Hard is it. It has so much action packed into the movie from beginning to end.

Not by Alexander Godunov as you described. Godunov plays Gruber's sidekick, Karl. I just wanted to let you know that for two reasons. Firstly, so people who haven't seen Die Hard can read your description and get the correct information about the characters they're going to see, and secondly, because Alan Rickman is my favorite actor and I think he deserves credit where credit is due. So whoever wrote that description would please be kind and edit the names. Thank you very much
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is certainly not for everyone. It explores two men's compulsion to kill and contrasts their psychopathic behavior. This Showtime series sets a mood that is both creepy and...yes, charming at times. Of course this is not real life - it's entertainment. However, it does delve into the real world of crime scene blood analysis and inter-office politics.     The extras are a bit on the light side (hence the quarter-star I removed from the review). But I remember the age of VHS season sets that usually had no extras so having an entire unedited episodic series is enough for me.    This series is sharp, lean and compelling from beginning to end. If you are not disturbed by the macabre and have a solid enough stomach, Dexter will prove to be a welcome addition to your collection.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|I've been a fan for a couple of years now, since I discovered her on an internet radio station from Italy. Strange, huh? I had seen her CD's in the store but had to discover her on a foreign radio station.     Anyway, I thought that she was excellent on the studio versions. I was blown away to hear the live versions! How many people do you know that sound as good as or even BETTER live versus in the studio? I've seen very few acts that can sing as well as they do on disk. With all of the technology out there like pitch correction software and the like I'm just stunned at how good she is live. Loreena also has some top-notch musicians backing her. I'll get my chance to see her live in October when she comes to NE Ohio. I can't wait. I'm sure it will be a surreal experience being that most of the shows I've seen (other than concerts by David Lanz & one by Brad Paisley) have been in the classic rock/metal genre. Can you picture an old-school metal guy digging the hell out of this red haired beauty? My sister just looks at me and wonders when I, all of a sudden, got... \\"cultured\\". ;-)    I also must say this is probably one of the best \\"sounding\\" concert DVD's I've ever seen. The acoustics at the Alhambra must have been something to behold because the sonic qualities of the DVD and CD's are amazing. If you have a quality sound system (especially surround) you'll love it. Get the DVD. You won't be disappointed. BTW, I bought the other version that comes in the CD-style case. Otherwise they are the same.
1582701709|5.0|We have many DVDs and audio CDs of this kind, but this is absolutely our favorite.  The way the message is organized and the people who deliver the message are so good that we never tire of it.  It never gets stale or repetitive.    Practical advice.  Realistic examples of how our thoughts affect our lives:     - Thinking of debt brings debt   - Thinking of being single leaves you single    ...and how to turn those thoughts around:     - Thinking of abundance brings abundance   - Thinking of fulfillment leaves to a fulfilled life    Excellent monologues from some of today's best thinkers.  Excellent quotes from some of histories best thinkers.  Plenty of food for thought...
B000AADYUI|5.0|When I listen to this album I put myself back in the place where the baby boomer generation was an unprecedented cadre of young people.  They were a passionate group who wanted to change the world.  As they became disillusioned and realized what an insurmountable challenge that was, some turned to drugs, some to violence.  Some just cut their hair and got jobs.  A group of musicians, not just from the Jefferson Airplane but including Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, and David Crosby and Graham Nash of Crosby Stills & Nash (and sometimes Young), apparently did their share of drugs but also hatched a fantastic story.  What if the government was secretly building a spaceship that was orbiting the earth?  What if a group of young people decided to hijack that starship and launch it into the black, creating a self-sufficient Utopian society in space?<br /><br />The best known song here is \\"Wooden Ships\\", although the better-known version is by Crosby, Stills and Nash.  That song to me has always been a post-apocalyptic vision, maybe of the alternate future that awaits us if we don't make a fresh start in space.<br /><br />This is not a polished art-rock effort but a loose collaboration of friends who are sharing the music with each other and with the listener.  I enjoy puzzling what it all might be about.
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|Epica took the best of TPA and the best of CtO. The Black Metal parts come in from Mark and drums. The Symphonic parts come from Simone and choir. The Prog parts well just listen to the songs.     Epica has really found there sound here and it's not simple Gothic metal oh no it's beyond what you would find in Gothic Metal bands. They took a big risk here with this CD and in my view it has paid off big time. They can no longer be place in the the same catagore as Within Temptation, Sirenia, and other bands like them. Gone are in of the ways to make them seem like Evanescence.    Just any exmpale of how different they are from those other bands listen to Death of a Dream. They  asked Sander Gommans to help out with this song. He had Mark go right to the heart of Black and Death Metal. Sander using the Death grunts Mark using the Black metal screams. If not for Simone and the chior this would have be falt out Black/Death Metal. Yeah it's that heavy.    Then there is there 14 minute long song The Divine Conspiracy. It's very different for Epica because it changes so many times in the song and not something you would really ever see out side of Prog metal. The only other femme metal band that will have a song this long is Nightwish.     So if you want a band that is playing by there rules pick up Epica's Divine Conspiarcy.
B000007492|5.0|i have always dug the smoothness and directness of Supertramp's Music.  take the long way home was a catchy cut that still is tight. Dreamer and the classic  the logical song was and is still happening. i dug there arrangements and the vocals were real cool.  this is a must have collection for other Supertramp fans. this is a great value for there hits.
B000OVLBF8|2.0|I wonder if Nicholas Cage knew what he was getting into when he choose to do this movie?     This movie really isn't very good at all. The plot is confusing,stupid and totally unbelievable even by comic book standards. The plot holes are big enough to drive a semi through. The special effects were mediocre by today's standards and it looks like some of the actors were just phoneing it in.     A pretty poor effort. It rivelas Fantastic 4 for one of the worst super hero movies made in the 21st Century. If you really want to see this movie get it from the library please don't plop down your own money.

B00005YXZH|2.0|This album has been overhyped.  It is a really mixed bag... I think track 3 is amazingly good, and the rest ranges from tolerable to a total loss.  Buying the whole album is a waste of money, in my opinion.  Be selective and save yer pennies...
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|OH I JUST LOVE THIS!! WHENEVER J-LO DOES ANY SORT OF ROMANTIC COMEDY/DRAMA IT'S A HIT!! THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN HER & RICHARD GERE....SO SWEET....THE MOVE WAS VERY ROMANTIC. MAKE ME WANT TO TAKE DANCE LESSONS!! KUDOS!!!
B000Q6GUW0|2.0|I bought the DVD set of the 1st Season of this show due primarily to the glowing comments of Amazon reviewers.  I watched the first two episodes of last night and must confess to being a bit bewildered.  What is so entertaining about a sociopath mass murderer who brutally tortures his victims as he decapitates them alive or chops off their limbs?  What on earth is entertaining about a protagonist who nearly has an orgasm over the idea of another serial killer who is even more clever and sadistic than he?  I really tried to give this series a chance, but I found it mind-numbingly sick!!  I can't find much of socially redeeming value in this work.  it really doesn't matter to me if the victims of Dexter are bad guys - his way of killing them is so barbaric that I find my sympathies leaning solidly toward his victims.  But, of course, the problem could just be with me - maybe I have too soft a stomach.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|I have to agreed with earlier reviewers that you need to pay attentions to the dialogues because they are very subtle and witty. The nuclear bomb threat is kind of lame but I thought the film is very funny and enjoyable with all the witty alternative scenarios and pick-up lines. The movie is not about saving the world but more about a person sacrificing himself and protecting the woman he loves.     The ending leaves me hanging in the air which may not be a bad thing because as Chris(Cage) said in the movie \\"once you look into the future, you change it and it is no longer the same.\\"     However, people at the theater seem to hate it and it didn't do well at the box office. Maybe, viewers were expecting action-thriller but instead they got a romantic comedy/drama. It just didn't fill their expectation.
B000M341QE|4.0|You gotta be kidding? Mob violence has to be for the demented and those who are living it.  I will grant Excellent acting - Excellent characters - demented writer.  As I am not a follower of DiCaprio and Damon - I sometimes had to look hard to tell the difference between the two [first time watching].  May appreciate it with another viewing. Ha!    I would have greatly appreciated some commentaries from the actors on how they view their characters. And on the makeing of the film with out all the technical jargon.  It is a great list of actors.    I did at one point become suspicious of the lady shrink - she started to put together the connection between Costigan and Sullivan [and she is left with his -----]  But now tell me, What was Wahlberg's agenda? Was he corupt? or just plain nasty?  [Loved him in the Shooter].    And I don't care if it is for realism or not - all their gutter language ruined it for me.  When will these guys [actors, writers, producers] grow up and realize that language does not make them very attractive.  They just sound illiterate - don't know any other way to express themselves. Are they mentally deficient?  Definitely not good for anyone under 25 <g>     Can't look away type of filmmaking? I could not look at it sometimes.    Ah well, pick your own poison -
B000Q9IZ5C|1.0|I eagerly awaiting receiving this DVD and then was completely disappointed. I don't know why they needed a second DVD -- they could have fit it all on one. There's really nothing new here except the same content re-edited over and over into 3-4 minute segments, a 21 minute segment that aired on SciFi, and River Tamm stuff that was already online. The movie itself is exactly the same (with the addition of DTS). Uh...I love this movie, but I didn't need a second copy with regurgitated crap on it.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|I finally sat down to watch the new Good the Bad and the Ugly DVD with the extended scenes, etc.  I haven't seen it in awhile and really got into it.  This has got to be hands down (at least for me) the best western ever made.  Every little detail of this movie emulates Sergio Leone's absolute brilliance.  He finally got his big budget on this film and he totally makes the most of it.<br /><br />  The movie is definitely carried first and foremost by its characters.  Obviously, Eastwood as Blondie, who is like the coolest cat you have ever scene in your life, dripping out classic lines such as,<br /><br />\\"Such ingratitude after all the times I've saved your life\\",<br /><br />\\".....Idiots......it's for you...\\".<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"Were you gonna die alone?\\"<br /><br />Van Cleef who Leone basically plucked out of TV obscurity to come star in two of the spaghetti westerns, was perfectly evil...<br /><br />Eli Wallch who could have easily won an academy award for this role as the shady bandit, Tuco.  Despite his overall sense of humor and seemingly good heart at times, Tuco cannot help being bad when it comes to greed, especially in terms of money.  Just when you think towards the end that Blondie and Tuco are really even (dare I say) friends, greed gets the better of Tuco when he takes off in the horse for the money in the cemetary.  Blondie calmly walks out of the abandoned church and as cool as a cucumber fires a couple of cannonballs at the fleeing Tuco.  ---Classic.  Sergio Leone slowly pans in for a close up of Blondie's cigar as it lights the cannon....with the theme song starting to play in the background....this is AWESOME.<br /><br />  Leone's artistic vision in this western is unprecedented to say the least.  Every scene contains a scent of authenticity to it---from the awesome costumes that look worn and frayed, to the dirty finger nails, to the blown out buildings and abandoned churches.  The cemetary scene in the end is simply phenomenal.  You couldn't pick out a better location with a better feel!  And then, we can't forget the actual actors themselves!  You talk about ugly scarred up dudes!  The flies hovering over their lips as they speak in broken Italian (dubbed in English almost comically at times).  Another thing I love about Leone is the constant creativity he has with the lense.  As Tuco is digging in the grave towards the end of the movie, you see Blonde's shadow creep up into the scene and a shovel is tossed at Tuco from off camera with Blonde saying, \\"It'll be a lot easier with that\\".  Leone seemed to love the mystery he gave audiences with characters talking off screen or off the view of the camera.  Even in one of the opening scenes where a few other bounty hunters capture Tuco and say, \\"Hey amigo, you know you have a face beautiful enough to be worth 2,000 dollars?\\"  At which, Blondie repies (off camera) \\"Yeah.  But you don't look like the ones who'll collect it.\\"  Then you show various shots of Blonde (but only from behind--lighting his cigar, or else his trigger finger---never his actual face)----it's awesome.<br /><br />  I found the new extended scenes to be interesting because it gave some more detail to the story.  The negatives were that they for some reason needed to redub all the voices in the new scenes (including Tuco's, Blondie's, and Angel Eyes).  They actually got a 99 year old Eli Wallach to use to dub his own character...and it's almost comical in the sense that in the new scenes Tuco sounds like......well......a crackling old shrieking guy.  They got some other guy to mimic Blondie's voice as well.  I don't understand why they needed to do this.  As far as I could tell Eastwood was still speaking English in those extended scenes...<br /><br />  When Quentin Tarrantino says that he feels that The Good the Bad and the Ugly is the best directed movie of all time I can totally see why.  I know that is quite a bold statement and I can't even say for sure it is actually true.  But Ido know for sure that it DEFINITELY is the best directed western of all time hands down.  From the intricate plot, the script, the characters, the authenticity of costumes, set design, etc.  this movie has it all.<br /><br />GREAT MOVIE
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I'll begin with an admission that I was looking forward to the book for which this CD serves as the soundtrack, more than this CD. Nikki's previous \\"solo\\" excursions haven't impressed me all that much.  I've always considered Nikki Sixx to be a \\"borderline lyrical genius\\". Problem was he was always writing lyrics about \\"nothing\\". He was shackled by the hair/glam metal boundaries of Motley Crue. This release Changes EVERYTHING !!!!  After hearing this CD, I'd prefer Sixx to concentrate on a solo career and leave little girl voiced Vince Neil behind. This is an amazing recording. The lyrics, orchestration, vocals, the musical performances- everything is top notch. This recording drips emotion and passion!!  Along with the incredible arrangements,every song has a hook which will have you singing along by the 2nd time you've played it. For me, the songs are playing over and over in my head already- and I LOVE IT!  I love hard rock/heavy metal. What makes it even better for me is when the lyrics tell a story-so naturally I am a big fan of concept albums.  This one ranks right up there with the greatest I have ever heard.  Queensryche's OPERATION MINDCRIME and PROMISED LAND come to mind as do W.A.S.P.'s THE CRIMSON IDOL and THE NEON GOD, parts 1 and 2 as well as Steve Vai's SEX AND RELIGION.  If you like your music well crafted and beautifully performed this CD is for you. Don't expect Dr. Feelgood, but simply open your ears and your mind, and let Nikki take you on an incredible musical and personal journey. I cannot express how grateful I am that Heroin never took Nikki's life. If it had, I would have suffered by never having heard this CD...  This recording is, in every sense of the word, a MASTERPIECE !!  Thank you Nikki Sixx for an awesome CD !!!!!
1881273156|5.0|My wife and I read this book about 10 years ago. It was instrumental in providing us with the insights and a common dialogue that has helped strengthen our marriage to this day. We bought 16 copies for family members----and we've never bought more than one extra book of any type. That should speak volumes. I heartily and gratefully recommend this book to anyone and everyone considering marriage, who is in a great marriage, who is in a rocky marriage.<br /><br />Note: while Chapman conveys his points in the context of Christianity (God is love, after all), any atheist would benefit from reading the book as well.
B00004YZFR|5.0|If you are a Rolling Stones fan and want to see them in concert footage at the absolute peak of their powers AND want to know what it must of been like to attend a free concert given by them in the late sixties with Hells Angels as concert security then this film/documentary is a must for any serious collector.  Brilliantly captured in all it's raw power it encapsulates the end of the sixties a time that will never be repeated in music history. Great quality remastering of the original product together with 5.1 and DTS sound mixes makes it the perfect music time capsule.
0767810856|3.0|The actual story behind the highly fictionalized movie script could have made a really good movie. According to the urban legend website SNOPES, the real events involved a not-so-young waitress and a not-so-young police detective who together select the winning numbers to a $6 million jackpot. There was no hint of romance between the two. But that would be too open-ended for the cookie cutter mentalities behind this movie. They must have went into a conference room -- or a lunch room -- or a diner -- and derived this formulaic romance between two unhappily married people.<br /><br />Their result was this plot bringing together a Prince Charming, a Cinderella, a the Wicked Witch of New York. But they forget to include a nice dramatic flow of events. I just didn't experience any peaks and very little emotional depth. In the end, I wasn't satisfied.<br /><br />At least Nicholas Cage makes the most of the opportunity to be normal and charming rather than quirky and charming (one of his first such efforts). He gives the movie whatever depth it attains. Pretty Bridge Fonda gives her usual quiet, unexciting performance. They're responsible for most of the positive rating I give this movie.<br /><br />Rosie Perez, unfortunately, overwhelms the entire proceedings with nasally witchiness. And that's not the memory I want to take away from a movie.<br /><br />So, I'm looking forward to the remake based on my own soon-to-be lottery success... Oooh, Briii-dget....
0060920084|4.0|We all know what big cities are like, but how about small towns?  Of course Bill Bryson did not (& obviously could not) visit all small towns in his home country, this book satisfied my curiosity towards small towns in America.      I guess there's always irresistible charm of overland travel, and Bryson described his overland trip with hilarious writing style.    One suggestion: if the editor could add a route map at the beginning of book showing Bryson's itinerary, it would be even better.
B000P0J024|5.0|Got hooked on the Traveling Wilburys a few years back listening to Tweeter and the Monkey Man. Really didn't know the other songs on the cd. Recently bought the cd and love the whole darn thing. It's awesome!
B00004W50T|5.0|Back in 1967 or 68 I had a record called \\"Music From Big Pink\\" and it changed my life...it changed the course Amderican Music...Please welcome...THE BAND
B000053VBL|2.0|I was expecting at least a glimpse of the substance present in the Hitchcock movies. After all, the movie is supposed to be a homage to the creator of Psycho, Vertigo and Rear Window. Instead, all we got is some style and a plot with less suspense than the average scooby-doo episode. It has a lot in common with B-movies such as the Theatre of Blood (1973 - Vincent Price), where all you get to expect is a series of killings. If watching a mad and average looking woman for two hours, who will stop at nothing to get her \\"revenge\\" (even using a 5-year old so she can turn him into an orphan) excites you, than this movie is for you.
B0000025ZF|5.0|The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated albums ever created. I would love to see more of this type of music/lyrics.      I listen and appreciate any type of music that I consider music (actual instruments played by actual people) and I count this as one of my favorite albums of any genre.     Along with Rogers emotional vocals, Dave Sanborn's sax and Eric Clapton's masterful guitar, the lyrics actually take you through the story, not just hearing it, but feeling it as well.     The one thing I find ironic, the title track doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the album, to me it seems like it was placed there produce a single and throws off the whole flow. It's a song I usually skip right over when I'm listening from start to finish.     If you do buy this album, in order to appreciate it fully, make time to listen to the whole thing from beginning to end, uninterrupted at least once, preferably the first time and with decent headphones.     If only more music can be like this...
B000FC0OOU|4.0|I read this book a couple years ago and loved it.  War, adventure, love, it's like The Princess Bride minus lighthearted fairytale-ness.  I highly recommend it.
B000TSIK14|5.0|...well after 3 years from their last effort, finally they did it again, this is a masterpice, for fans and not so fans, their sound is there but somehow updated!     this is a concept album in the sense of dealing with certain topic: Human kind, is not a concept album in the vein of telling a whole story and all songs are related one to another, this is about de decadence of the human being and why we seem to just not care about it at all.     Great songs, this is a must have for any hard-rock fan, the veteran rockers prove that their still are in top of the game, they still got it and remain strong. Klaus voice reached another level, a better level than in unbrekable, it is just amazing how this guy rocks! .......as another reviewer said, go and make yourself a faver, GRAB THIS ONE!     PS. They never left, so this is not a \\"comeback\\" like many dj's or sites are saying!!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|Amazing performance! Acoustic Hotel California blew me away! Why couldn't The Beatles bury the hatchet before Mark David Chapman decide to play God?
B000002JSR|3.0|I am saddened in writing this even though years have passed since John death brought the band to end their reign of the Master of Rock. Kings? Perhaps. John is missed to this day. CODA was a last treasure released by Led Zeppelin, a compilation of previously unreleased material. Like a \\"lets give them the rest\\" type deal. many of the songs aren't great but we true Zeo fans never were ones for lacking the desire for wanting anything and everything they did. Not disappointing by no means but it is just a collection of songs over the years that were not put on any other album. I never did understand why the crunge was put out when there were clearly better songs to take its place.
B000INAXGU|5.0|Stumbled upon Jamiroquai in 2002 after purchasing a used version of the Travelling Without Moving CD. And that was when I became hooked! I can't believe that Jamiroquai is not in heavier rotation here in the US.     The CD is a great compilation and includes some of his(Jay Kay's) more popular songs including Virtual Insanity, Cosmic Girl, A Little L, Love Foolosophy, and Canned Heat. Also included from the Dynamite CD are Feels Just Like It Should and  Seven Days In Sunny June, which are 2 of the best songs from that CD.     If you are into Dance music or just want something funky and different, this is a great CD! You'll wonder why you didn't discover it sooner!     BTW, this band, the lead singer being Jay Kay for the ~15 years or so, may sound to some like Maroon 5. But they were here long before Maroon 5 and are much more prolific. So, really, no comparison. Much funkier, much groovier, much more fun to dance to!
B000002540|5.0|Absolutely a great representation of the powerhouse that BOC was back in the 70's. This is to date still one of my favorite live albums. I saw them live a lot and they put on a hell of a show. This album really does make you feel like your in the arena watching them perform. Great production and a perfect example of how raw yet powerful BOC was live. Buck is at the top of his game and blisters the lead solos from beginning to end. The Last days Of May (A True Story) has a hauntingly brilliant and beautiful yet all too short lead guitar solo. Buck Dharma (Donald Roeser) is a superior lead guitarist that never ever got his just due. He is great throughout this release. A Must have for any true rock fan of any era.
B000OVLBF8|5.0|In looking over other reviews around here, I'm seeing plenty of \\"weak plot\\" and \\"Nicolas Cage can't act\\" stuff. Well, nonsense.  The plot here is terrific and well thought out. Nicolas Cage is and Academy Award winning actor whose reputation speaks for itself. He is very believable in his comic character portrayal of the Ghost Rider. Some other reviewers say that you have to be a fan of the comic series to enjoy this movie...more nonsense. This movie was exceptional and left open for plenty more sequels. Eva Mendes could have had more lines...granted, and the love story could have blossomed into something more, but, I believe that's being left for the continuation of the series!  Oustanding special effects and an exceptional story!  Highly recommended!  Bippy Video votes 5 popcorns on this one.
B000TGJ8IU|5.0|I am lucky enough to have seen a screening of the Director's Cut for Troy prior to this DVD's release.  I haven't seen the DVD extras, so all I can address here is the movie itself.  It is fanstastic - the 40 minutes of additonal material adds meat to the bones of the original. The added footage and new score gives the movie a grander scope and serious gravitas. The colors are richer. There are additional scenes that give you a better insight into the Paris and Helen relationship as well as scenes that give more depth to Odysseus and Priam.  I loved it.    I was already a fan of the original, and now cannot recommend this new improved version highly enough.
B000R4SMCW|3.0|....where's the suspense?  Marketed as a thriller, FRACTURE lays its cards on the table from the beginning; not many surprises in watching them played out, either.  That said, the writing's literate and solid, the physical production handsome, the actors fine (no surprises there, either, given this cast).  Ryan Gosling's one of the most interesting actors of his generation, and he invests his lawyer-on-the-make with fascinating quirks and complexity.  Pity Embeth Davidtz, always an interesting actress, has come to three scenes, then a coma this early in her career; nice chance here for Rosamund Pike, though.  Pleasant enough Saturday night rental, but nothing spectacular.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I was skeptical about this show so I didn't give it my full attention. I kiind of caught a few episodes in between other shows. but never gave it much thought. I wish I had given the show more credit. I recently rented season one, now I'm happy to say I'm hooked. Though being a late convert, It's kind of poitless for me to watch on tv now as  I have two more seasons to catch up on. Oh well... If you liked Buffy, Angel and similar. You'll likely enjoy Supernatural. Jared Padalacki and Jenson Ackles are brilliant together, as the brothers Winchester. Witty banter all over the place, and the car, oh my goodness. Anyway you probably know the plot by now, two brothers travel cross country. exterminating supernatual badies, while hunting the thing that killed their mother, and Sam's girlfriend. and trailing their father, trying to stop him from facing the thing on his own. Things take an even stranger turn when Sam starts having dreams of deaths before they happen. There can be a lot of pit falls for a series like this, and while a few of the episodes flop. Most of them are are seriously good. I'm very much looking forward to the season 2 dvd in September.
B00005O41R|5.0|I dont have a fancy stereo or any new high tech equipment, but good music<br />sounds good through any media...and from my famous 20 inch T.V. the Bee<br />Gees sound came out in force and nearly melted my ears with their incredible music spanning multiple decades. A great show that can be<br />watched over and over again.  Thanks for the memories.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|The 6 stars go to the Dylan set. I recall seeing this in the theatre on a large screen and thought \\"finally, some magic.\\" 4 stars for what came before that set...average 5.
0765316889|4.0|I continue to think about The Well of Ascension long after I read it. That is what makes it a great book. It is a clever, provocative, and entertaining sequel. I like how Sanderson grounds it in simple ideas and emotions: love, duty, religion, trust, etc. This novel should be read carefully; the author is precise with his words and creates a riddle that is both hard to solve and satisfying once it is resolved. I can think of no other fantasy author who compels me to think about what I've read--to the extent of rereading pages--as much as Sanderson does.    As good as this novel is, it is not without its shortcomings. I still think that the Allomantic action is hard to follow with its Pushes and Pulls. I also think that the romance between Vin and Elend lacks passion. They behave more like best friends than lovers. Not only is there is a notable absence of sex, but their attraction seems to stem from respect and curiosity more than physical desire.    If you are looking for a new fantasy series that lives up to the hype, I recommend Sanderson's Mistborn novels.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I know many people don't think so, but I really think this is the best Bond movie ever.    Granted, I haven't seen all of them, but I've seen enough, and I'm very happy to see that this movie goes back to the original Bond roots, showcasing his first mission and (in the first few minutes of the movie) how Bond became 007.  No longer is he the run-and-gun-and-blow-things-up Bond of the Brosnan movies, he's a cold, calm, sophisticated and cocky assassin like he was meant to be.    Daniel Craig is great as Bond, something which took most people by surprise - including myself.  The other actors all do a very good job, as well.  The movie is paced well and will keep you watching from start to finish.    Since this is a DVD, I should mention that the special features are alright, but the movie is what you should be getting this for.
B000HOJCKI|5.0|Mastodon is the rarest kind of metal band -- a really brilliant, creative one. No posing or nu-metal appeals for radioplay here.<br /><br />And after their previous brilliant albums, they reached a new apex in \\"Blood Mountain.\\" The Atlanta band spins songs about a beautiful, icy land -- played in a sonic eruption of kinetic instruments and some brilliantly mythic lyrics. It's a fiery, breathtaking ride.<br /><br />It opens with rapid-fire drums and a squealing guitar, with a hoarse voice shouting, \\"The hero of the gods/The crossing of the threshold!\\" But the music soon uncoils into a fast-moving hard-rocker, full of blistering riffs and surreal lyrics about gods, shapeshifters, tyrants, heroes and \\"hulder folk and fairies.\\"<br /><br />Then we break into the tribal drums and blazing, sludgy riffs of \\"Crystal Skull,\\" which is just begging to be air-guitared. And they don't let up in the songs that follow: the darkly epic \\"Sleeping Giant,\\" metal with nimbly catchy melodies, sludgy hard-rock that blazes with muscular basslines, and expanses of roaring prog-metal that races by at light speed.<br /><br />No ballads. No interludes. Sure, some of these songs open with some electronic squiggling, or maybe a mellow guitar melody, but they don't take long to explode into something totally different. The only exception is \\"Pendelous Skin,\\" the very last song on the album -- it's an atmospheric blend of slow-burning rock played in a more alt-rocky style.<br /><br />But up until then, it's nothing but rapid-fire, headbanging proggy-rocky metal. Sludgy and/or muscular riffs, smashing bass, and blindingly rapid drums that have to be heard to be believed -- and the whole thing is tightly woven out of different styles. And this is all to make story-songs with complex, intense melodies that can change in midsong -- from epic metal to chaos, and back again -- to reflect whatever is happening.<br /><br />And the world Mastodon is exploring in this just reeks of fantasy and old legends -- nature gods, wilderness, icy lands, skulls, tree people, ivory towers, one-eyed monsters, more skulls, and ancient elms. I have no idea what they're trying to communicate, but their songwriting is definitely atmospheric (\\"A vast calm wilderness/The call to adventure comes/Lead and land atop this rock/Infinite path carved with unrivaled skill...\\")<br /><br />Mastodon's \\"Blood \\"Mountain\\" is a devastatingly, frighteningly mythic experience, like wandering through an ancient legend. Here's hoping this band only gets better with time.lls, tree people, ivory towers, one-eyed monsters, more skulls, and ancient elms.

B000P0J024|4.0|While it is obvious that the first CD is going to be better than the second, because in the meantime Roy Orbison had died, both CDs are worth listening to, and not just once.  While there wasn't as much eclectic sound as I was hoping for, there is a good deal of good old rock and roll beat in these CDs for guys living in the 1980s.  My special favorite is the special track, a coverage of the old Del Shannon song, Runaway.  I never thought anyone could do it better until I heard this.  Imagine it in harmony!  This is a definite plus addition to my collection, which pretty much halts by the mid-70s.    It is especially fun to read the history of the Wilburys included with the collection, although I was disappointed not to be treated to the words and lyrics by.
B00005OAE6|5.0|Their names are Barry Becket(pianos,organs,synthesizers), Pete Carr(lead guitar), David Hood(bass), Roger Hawkins(drums), Jimmy Johnson(rhythm guitar), and the Muscle Shoals Horns(Harrison Callaway,Ronnie Eads,and Harvey Thompson). Though almost always overlooked when crediting that Seger sound, that sound wouldn't have been nearly as real, raw, and soulful without that touch of Alabama funk.   Bob Seger was raised on rhythm and blues and soul music, much of which was cut in Muscle Shoals, Alabama by these men and a previous crew featuring Duane \\"Skydog\\" Allman. Thats why Seger spent most of the 70's in Muscle Shoals. That was about the only place you could get a true soul feel to mix with rock and roll and I think they succeeded fairly well.   Listen to songs like Till It Shines, Main Street, Rod Stewart's Tonight's The Night and I Don't Want To Talk About It to name a few and you can hear the unmistakable style of Pete Carr on lead guitar. David Hood, who was introduced to the world by his bass work in the Staple Singers, I'll Take You There, never failed to live up to expectations in the Muscle Shoals portions of Seger's 70's albums. Roger Hawkins, who along with Hood joined Traffic before returning home to handle the drums. Jimmy Johnson's guitar playing has been overshadowed by his skill as a producer and engineer. When the Rolling Stones came to Sheffield, Al to record Brown Sugar and Wild Horses, it was Johnson at the controls.   Then there's the man, who along with Seger is the most important part of that \\"Seger sound\\", Barry Beckett. Of all of the rhythm and blues, rock and roll, soul, and country music work he has done, I think he did his greatest work with Bob Seger. Everytime I listen to We've Got Tonight, a chill runs down my spine as Seger's voice and Beckett's piano soar to the top of Everest, then floats quietly down the Tennessee River.   They were magic together as was the 70's music-wise. My son's have stated how great it must have been to grow upin that decade. What an embarrassment of riches we had. Seger, the Stones, The Who, Pink Floyd, the Doobie Bros, the Eagles, Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Allman Bros, Journey, Foreigner, McCartney and Lennon, the Dead, Rod Stewart, Boston, Elton John...I could go on and on and on!  Unfortunately, as Seger drifted away from the Shoals, it seemed he also drifted away from his roots. While I liked the work he did in the 80's, 90's and now the 2000's(boy that seems awkward), I much preferred the simpler, more straight-ahead music of the 70's. Of course, alot of it could be that I had rather be a teenager than closing in on the half-century mark.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Speed freak Kowolski has a heavy foot on the gas and a bloodstream full of stimulants as the viewer is treated to a Denver to San Francisco hellride. Cleavon Little as DJ SuperSoul is the glue that holds it together, a technique borrowed for use by the DJ in 1979's \\"The Warriors\\".  Soundtrack good and if you saw it on TV as I did as a squirt, you'll be treated to a naked hottie hippy chick in a scene edited out for the small screen.
B000AYEL6U|2.0|I bought this DVD after reading the reviews from other buyers.  I own several other movies and thought to add it to my collection.  I have to say I struggled to watch this movie and was greatly disappointed.  It is very dark and depressing.  I could watch the news on TV if I wanted to be depressed.  Even the clothes of the characters is dark.  Plus I had a difficult time understanding some of the characters speech and what was going on.  This movie is was not what I expected at all.<br />I've tried watching this movie a few more times and still really can't get into it.  Just my opinion, others may love it and that's theirs.  I was really hoping I would like it.
B000068FXR|5.0|There is a perception out there that Supertramp took a step backward from Crime of the Century with the release of this album. I disagree. It is another 5 star classic. I put it right up there with Crime, and there are times I'll put this CD on first if I want a Supertramp fix.    The vocals from Hodgson and Davies are top notch again. Not many bands can claim to have two high quality lead singers. The \\"environmentally and spiritually conscious\\" theme of the CD make this one especially relevant even today.
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|The first time I heard this album, I was completely blown away. The second, third, and now tenth time I have heard this album, I'm still blown away. This is symphonic rock/metal taken to astronomical heights, complete with superbly composed music, incredible production quality, and what is now one of the most gorgeous, refined voices in the genre. Simone Simons sings like a siren on this CD, and your jaw will be dropped by how good she sounds. There are also grunts performed by Mark Jansen, which are entirely effective and add that special edge to the music. The chorus is spectacular, as is the orchestra, here utilized to perfection. The whole album clocks at a healthy 75 minutes, and not a second is wasted.    1. Indigo (5/5) The best introduction Epica has ever done. A haunting, strings-driven choral piece, it perfectly sets up the tone for the rest of the album.     2. The Obsessive Devotion (5/5) This one plain-old rocks. Grunts and guitars drive it for an adrenaline-packed seven minutes, and Simone is heard for the first time. And boy, does she sound good.    3. Menace Of Vanity (4/5) A little generic and a bit similar to the previous track, but it's still quite good.      4. Chasing the Dragon (6/5) I think this might be my favorite. It maintains a spellbinding beauty for all of its seven and a half minutes, and you never do want it to end. Simone has never sounded better than she does here, with a huge range of the utmost purity and sweetness in her voice. The climax here also rocks, just for the record.        5. Never Enough (4.5/5) The first single off of the album (and if you want to check out the video, make sure that you see the vastly superior extended version). Though it's probably the most commercial song here, it lacks not in quality or catchiness. A passionately sung, vengeful piece of music, it features some fantastic Arabic flourishes and a concluding note by Simone that packs more power than a steamroller.     6. La'fetach Chataz Rovetz (4.5/5)A rare instrumental piece, and quite a nice break. It is tranquil yet engaging, exotic yet very pleasing to hear.       7. Death of a Dream (5/5) A harrowing, ferociously beautiful song. And surprise surprise, Simone sounds incredible.    8. Living a Lie (5/5) Another great one, featuring Latin and Gregorian-sounding chanting to add to the effect.    9. Fools of Damnation (6/5) I don't think Epica songs get better than this song. It's incredible, with savage grunts, heavy Arabic influences, some wicked cool organ playing, and blindingly captivating singing.    10. Beyond Belief (4.5/5) Some particularly good singing and guitar here, though the voices in the middle are a tad out of place.        11. Safeguard To Paradise (5/5) A lovely ballad, almost dripping with the beauty of Simone pouring her heart out against the strings section.     12. Sancta Terra (5/5) More Arabic influences here, with exceptional harmonies between Simone and the choir (and the men in the choir sound especially good).       13. The Divine Conspiracy (5.5/5) The title song puts the \\"epic\\" in \\"Epica.\\" Yes, it's 14 minutes, which might be a little daunting, but how could it claim to be epic if it wasn't? An orchestral intro and outro frame this masterpiece, which itself is everything you could ever hope for. I'll leave it at that.    If you want to buy this CD just because Simone is au naturel on the cover, go right ahead. But I promise that you will be in for much more of a treat than just that.
B000068FXX|5.0|Another superb, underrated album. For the first time, however, Roger Hodgson's songs are vastly superior to Rick Davies'. On their first two albums together, they were dead even, but Davies' efforts here are a tad \\"insignificant\\" in comparison to \\"Give a Little Bit\\", the title cut, and \\"Fools Overture.\\"
6302470021|2.0|The movie is not funny.  The movie is way, way, way out there, and if you enjoy that sort of thing you will be highly entertained.
B000068FY0|5.0|Crime of the Century is one of those albums, like Dark Side of the Moon, where you don't even have to mention the artist's name. Now 33 years old, it is still relevant today.  What sets this album apart, as many have commented, is the sound quality. Using early 1970's equipment, the sound quality is incredible. It is hard to imagine anyone doing any better job with all of the equipment available today.  No matter how good the sound quality, though, it wouldn't matter without great music. Virtually every song here is a classic rock radio standard. The alternation between the somewhat jarring vocals of Roger Hodgson, and the more traditional sound of Rick Davies is a perfect balance. There are no weak songs here. I'm not sure if Supertramp is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but if they aren't, I can't imagine why. A very underrated band.
B000NA2776|5.0|This album is just pure and simple fun. Pop at its finest! It is thoroughly enjoyable, and I would definately reccomend it. Everyone I have introduced it to has loved it so far.
B000069HJI|4.0|I don't know if the band members ever commented on this, but I get the impression that even they were surprised by the incredible success of Breakfast in America. Certainly the expectations were incredibly high to make a great follow up album. Unfortunately, Famous Last Words failed to come close to the success of Breakfast.    The songs are just not up to par here. In fact, I consider this the weakest of the Hodgson-involved albums. The Rick Davies songs are beyond awful, while some of the Hodgson stuff is his usual high quality.    In hindsight, it is fairly easy to tell that there were troubles in the band when listening to this. Unfortunately, they couldn't come up with a \\"farewell\\" album worthy of the band.
1582701709|1.0|Need I say more?  This is, quite simply, a classic case of snake oil designed to separate ignorant people from their money.  Not a shred of fact in the whole thing.  You're better off buying lottery tickets.
B000068FWC|5.0|It's interesting. If you played Crime of the Century, Crisis What Crisis, Even In The Quietest Moments and Breakfast in America for someone who had been in a coma for 40 years, and had never heard of Supertramp; and then asked them which of the 4 would make them superstars, I don't think they would pick Breakfast in America. It must have just been Supertramp's time for a break, because, musically, Breakfast is the weakest of the 4.    Having said that, Supertamp must have made a conscious effort to make more commercial music here, because the only song from the earlier 3 that would fit on Breakfast is \\"Give a Little Bit.\\"    I still love this album, and remember being very happy for Supertramp that this album got them so many new fans. I also remember being pretty smug because I was already a fan long before Breakfast in America.
0553278398|5.0|I first picked up Foundation because I had heard so much about the series on a science fiction podcast and its forum that I listen to.  I wanted to know what the hype was all about over these books.  There was always some kind of topic on the series, and the Robot series too.  So I decided to pick up Foundation the next time I went to the book store.    I devoured Foundation.  I read it in about three days.  Asimov just seemed to speak to me, not only with the ideas, but also the writing style.  After Foundation, I moved on to Foundation and Empire, another great book in the series.  After reading Foundation and Empire, I decided to read Prelude to Foundation, because one of my friends at school had been reading it at the same time I was reading Foundation, and highly praised it; I just had to decide on what order to read the books: Second Foundation or Prelude to Foundation?  I finally decided to read Prelude.    I loved this book.  Asimov really knows how to keep a reader interested.  Unlike the other two Foundation novels I've read, this one is filled with action, and is still able to deliver the mind blowing twist at the end.  His style has changed from the other Foundation novels, but it does not take away from the experience.  Instead of many sub-stories that slowly reveal the universe, Prelude is one continuous story about one person.  Set during the 'flight' period of Hari Seldon's life, Asimov takes us on a journey through the home world of the Galactic Empire, Trantor, a world filled with a wider variety of cultures than the Galaxy itself!  During his flight, Seldon searches for a way to cultivate his Psychohistory and make it feasible.  Constantly on the run from governmental forces, Seldon must balance his research, his flight for freedom, and his integration into new cultures all at once.  Action packed and with a plot twist that will have all Asimov fans giddy with excitement, this book kept me interested through every page!    I highly recommend thisbook to not only Asimov fans (any fan will definitely get a kick out of this one), but also to anyone interested in reading science fiction classics, or even any science fiction in general!  What's not to like for an SF fan?  Its got space travel, fast speeds, futuristic guns, futuristic societies and cultures, and doubts about the origin of humans! (Earth? A myth or a reality? *chuckle*) It took me about a week to read the book, but that was only because I was busy during that week.  Had I had time, I would have devoured the book in 2 days!  This book is well worth the time I put into it, and is especially worth it for Asimov fans, for it ties in his Robot and Empire novels incredibly well; it is a real tickle to see those tie-ins.    So, if you are thinking of buying this book, do.  It is well worth the money and the time, plus it is not much money at all.  You will not regret it!
0143038419|4.0|When I received this book I could not remember why I had ordered it.  It is quite an unusual choice for me as I do not consider myself particulaly spiritual or religious.  I do love Italy and my husband is from India, though.  At times I would forget this was a non-fiction book as I felt so wrapped up in the story.  While the author does discuss spirituality and religion, there is no moral condemnation for people that don't.  I tended to view this book as someone seeking to better themselves in a way that felt right for them.  The book is well written and really does read as a fiction book.  There were a few times when I felt she did get a little too detailed and was asking too many questions or providing too much background information.  These were fairly short.  This book has definitely given me food for thought about the different ways to deal with life and I learned a lot about different cultures.  If you are searching for something but not sure what this is a good book to read.  It is not a self help book but will just remind you that whatever works for you is right and be kinder to yourself.
B000A2UBN4|4.0|Scorcese's remake of the 1962 classic is a very good film, with stand-out performances from Jessica Lange, Nick Nolte and especially Robert DeNiro. DeNiro was 49 or 50 years old when this movie was shot. You'd never believe it though, he was in fantastic shape, literally working out for hours per day to get the physique you see on the screen.<br /><br />Where Scorcese has moved the goal posts compared with the original film is that the family are no longer just good and Cady bad. All the family members have problems: Jessica Lange suspects Nick Nolte is having an affair. Nick Nolte withheld information that might have sent saved Cady from Jail, which as a defense lawyer is not good form!<br /><br />This being a Scorcese movie there were bound to be a few great set pieces, perhaps the best of which is the school hall seduction scene. There are some quite unpleasant scenes in this film (noteably the short rape scene) and although a lot of the violence is not shown, if your of a nervous disposition or easily scared I'd give it a miss.<br /><br />The films main failing is that its just a bit to flash for its own good. If Scorcese had pulled in the reins a bit he might of made another classic. It IS a good movie, but not a great one.
0812550706|5.0|This book is in easy read for all ages.  It is also perfect for anyone new to reading sci-fi.    Like I said, this book is core reading for any sci-fi fan.
159562015X|5.0|This is a wonderful addition to the original text.  After spending 100's of hours working with the Gallup process and teaching Now Discover Your Strengths in a graduate level course, this book really brings it home for the reader.  The assessments outline in a more detailed way how to use the Talents and Strengths and the additional information about who we really are as individuals is great.
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|I bought 300 on blue about a week after it came out. When i played it on my 42 inch samsung, from my ps3 it looked like absolute grainey garbage. I went to stores like circuit city and best buy and they said the picture looked grainey because of the cgi it was filmed in.  It serious looks so bad where i just want to watch it on a normal tv, so i don't feel like im watching this movie during Hurricane Katrina.
B000TSIK14|3.0|Professional showmen like the Scorpions are magic on stage, if you have never seen them you have got to watch for the next tour in your area.  Pros also compose 1 or 2 songs a month and keep large catalogs that never make it to the public.  On the best selling albums, many weaker songs are cut for stronger ones.  Regarding this new release the vocals are excellent; however the punch factor and ripping edge is not there.   I wish it was.  I would pay $30 a CD for 10 songs with that going on. Really!   I welcome that they are still out there but all this down tempo ballad focus is not going to get the teenagers and the rest of the Scorpions fan base interested.  That is what metal needs right now. There is nothing going on and the time is ripe for a breakout metal group or established group with new material to dominate like before.   That is why when the Rolling Stones go on tour they sell out for 2 nights in every city with 30 year old catalog.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|The Butterfly Effect abounded in creative plotlines, but I found the first third of this movie so slow-moving I almost gave up, and I'm someone with a surplus of focusable attention. It was nice to see Ashton Kutcher making the leap to the big screen and I give him full credit for putting his all into a difficult role. I liked the idea that by going back in time and trying to make things better, tiny deeds can set off unforeseen changes to everything that might come after. (Ray Bradbury used this theme well in his classic short story A Sound of Thunder.) In The Butterfly Effect, Kutcher's character returns again and again to his own past in order to try to right the wrongs that ruined the lives of a girl he loved, that girl's emotionally-unstable brother, and a third friend, who also goes on to a pathetic future that can be directly traced to the same key moments. The catch is, of course, that with each interference into the timeline, ripple effects occur and while certain areas of the existence of the four might improve, overall there are unacceptable consequences that inspire yet another trip backward. One weakness to this film was that there was little explanation or exploration of exactly how Kutcher's character was undertaking these jaunts into the past. That was left wide open and wasn't covered very well at all. I can respect saying that something \\"just is\\" and going on from there, but it still would have been nice had the means of his ability been fleshed out just a bit more. I also wondered why if the flashbacks to childhood were set (as revealed on a tombstone) in 1995, a relatively recent year, the hairstyles and fashions of the kids looked more like they were from the early `80's. Maybe a subtle effort to give the impression of distance between the latter-day events and the tragedies of once upon a time? Overall The Butterfly Effect was neither great science fiction nor a moving love story but it wasn't visual junk food either. I'll give it five stars for intention, three for what this production ultimately pulled off.r intention, three for what this production ultimately pulled off.
B000SQFC0E|5.0|This was a beloved movie on my part, for it's sweet, childlike innocence and wonderful sense of accomplishment.  Being this was made in the 80s, several movies following Star Wars had a sci fi theme, were aimed at kids 14 and under, incorporated new technologies (in this case, videogames), and had a happy ending.    Alex is a kid from a trailer park.  He is ernest, dependable and hard working, and (talk about science fiction) not white trash in the slightest.  His fellow trailer park residents are also, amazingly, not trashy and more like a charming small town of characters.  His only escape from his mundane existence, besides his girlfriend Maggie, is his love of the one and only arcade videogame, Starfighter.  Because of his agility with the joystick, one day an intergalactic con man named Centari comes to earth and offers him an opportunity to become a starfighter.  He leaves a beta unit (a carbon copy of Alex) in his place, and off they go into outerspace.  Alex, however, chickens out.  He says he doesn't want to be a starfighter, he's not important enough, he's not worthy, etc.  And Centari said something that I thought was a bit jeuvenile, but in the recent past I have been shown time and time again that truth is in the simplicity of : \\"If that's what you think, that's all you'll ever be\\".      And that is true.  You CAN do anything you want.  Climb the mountain, travel to distant lands, even save the universe with a videogame.  If you want something bad enough, if you work hard, if you put anything and everything you have into whatever it is you want, you'll get it.  How many people have I seen not get what they want because they just gave up?  They chicken out because they don't have someone else to attempt it with them or because they can't go it alone?  Cowardice is always far safer, as Alex shows us, but heroics bring glory, as he later shows us.    The special effects were cutting edge at the time, and now they look silly.  But, in a period piece such asthis, it's not without it's charm to know that it's just a guy in a rubber mask or primative computer graphics programs.  And the comedy antics are always fun, with the Beta Unit's bumbling fish out of water attitude and being clumbsy on earth, as well as Alex's awkwardness while in space.  This takes me back to a happy time.
B00004T0UT|5.0|I'm very new to buying Elvis recordings, and my main reason for buying this CD is to get the classics \\"Kentucky Rain\\", \\"In the Ghetto\\", and \\"Suspicious Minds\\".  The surprise here is that this is great stuff all the way through.  I totally understand why some say that this was his finest album (even though two of the songs I bought it for are bonus tracks).<br /><br />All in all, a great choice for the newbie Elvis music collector.
B00004RE0E|3.0|Most of the other reviews that I have read about this version of the Escape CD focus on how great the music is and what it meant to the people listening to it which is of course great. One of the reason we listen to music is because it makes us feel something and brings back memories. I agree with all the reviews that I read but I will focus a bit on the actual technical, musical quality of this recording. Please keep in mind this review is based on my first listen of the SACD. Upon first playing the disc I was impressed but not as blown away as you might think listening to an SACD remaster of a classic album like this. According to the liner notes it is a 22 Bit remaster using Sony's SMB (Super Bit Mapping) transfer technology and then of course encoded to SACD. As someone who has never owned this album on anything but LP I have to say that this is a very detailed recording but a little on the bright side. Good imaging, okay soundstaging-not as broad as I would have liked, the guitars sounded very smooth and natural, vocals the same, but again a little on the bright side. Nothing a notch down on the treble wouldn't cure. All the guitar solos we know and love sound great and very clean. This SACD doesn't sound as \\"fat\\" with regards to the overall bass presentation. It is a bit lean as compared to the LP which has more \\"bloom\\" around the instruments, more air. Overall, this is a great remaster of a 1981 album but it is not perfect. If you have an SACD player it is worth it to get. Remember though, it is the songs and the memories that really matter.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|A totally captivating film version of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel.  Three things expecially distinguish this interpretation:  wonderful acting from the entire cast, particularly the spirited Jane (Ruth Wilson) and the tormented but appealing Rochester (Toby Stephens) (their attraction is totally believable!); outstanding production values and attention to period detail; and a script which misses none of the major plot points of the novel, but immediately engages the viewer by begining with Jane's arrival at Thornfield, and gradually revealing her early life as back story, rather than developing the tale chronologically.<br /><br />It should be noted that the film omits the explicit Protestant Christian aspects of the novel (and Jane's attendant prejudices), at least directly, while leaving intact Jane's defiantly independent sense of her own worth and her deep sense of what is due to other people.  It might be fair to say that this is a fundamental betrayal of the novel--as deeply religious as Jane is--but there is no question that as a film story per se, this was the correct decision.<br /><br />I would not be surprised to find that this seductive film leads many viewers to read the novel, but it stands on its own as a well-made work of art.
B000002C1W|4.0|Ok, let me be clear.  I don't get high, I don't like watching `The Wall' while stoned to see what kind of images get conjured up on my current buzz.  I never listed to Pink Floyd much in grade school, or Junior High and even less in High School.  Until my senior year.  Before that I was familiar with the popular songs; Another Brick in the Wall...ok, so that was actually the only one.  I was more into the metal bands like Whitesnake and Poison...no I swear I don't get high and never did.  But when you get a little older you start getting tired of the guitar solos, you want something different.  Something more crafted.  In my last year of high school I pick up Momentary Lapse of Reason based on `Learning to Fly' which was getting plenty of air play on the radio.  I thought it was awesome.  I wasn't familiar with the phenomenon that was Pink Floyd, I knew they were popular but I hadn't heard anything about them since The Wall and that was most likely due to the fact that there were lawsuits being settled between the band and Roger Waters due to their split.    Soon after I heard the live version of Comfortably Numb on the radio from the Delicate Sound of Thunder CD.  I bought that double CD and suddenly I was a post Roger Waters/Pink Floyd fan.  David Gilmore is one of the most soulful and artistic guitarists to date.  He makes the guitar not only sing, but wail with melodic harmonies and riffs.  Especially on 'Sorrow' and 'Yet another movie'.  The songs are definitly similar to the previous albums in some ways but certianly a departure.  Dogs of War, Learning to Fly, A New Machine and On The Turning Away conjure up memories of the old albums and let you know that the song writing on all the others was greatly influenced by the band, and not just Roger Waters.    MLOR is an album of great music.  And I think all members of Pink Floyd would appreciate that comment.  They are one of the genuine bands that is in the business to make music.  It's usually off Center, alternative music that sometimes makes you go `what?' but not on this CD.  Here they've managed to sound like Pink Floyd but with out the odd lyrics and insane men laughing or screaming about meat and pudding in the background.  If you want to like a band for their ability to make something that is great to listen to, then this CD could introduce you to something you might not expect.  It is Floyd, but it isn't Floyd when you compare it to the older albums or even the newer Division Bell CD.  But you know what, who cares if it doesn't sound like the old stuff, it still sounds good.
1400063515|2.0|Like other reviewers have already stated, the author seems so full of himself and his eruditeness that it clouds the message he is trying to convey.  I understood his points, and he did a credible job explaining,  that forecasting is worthless, the Bell Curve is not to be worshipped, and Lebanon is a mess. But he really lost me when the bankrupt philosophies of atheists Bertrand Russell and Richard Dawkins were trumpeted. Atheism is really the religion of materialism and since Taleb is keen on figuring out what is probable in the finite world, he is on the same page as them.  The problem comes when these guys try to figure out the infinite world.  With their circular reasoning, they can't do it.        But Taleb tries.  He rolls out the the religion of evolution.  The author cannot figure out where the generator of randomness comes from so the bankrupt \\"theory\\" of evolution is shlepped out to cover that argument. For all of Talebs obsession with proving and testing models, he keeps talking about evolution as if it has been proven. All the author had to do was ask one of his science buddies who study DNA to tell him that the DNA of a gorilla cannot mutate into a human or even a simple step towards it.  If it did, the result would either be sterile or dead. In the end, when evolution doesn't work as the generator of randomness, we learn that Microsoft was the result of \\"luck\\".     Also, Pascal's faith in God was already on solid ground.  He didn't need his comment to an unbeliever to make his faith.  Pascals reasoning was simply another support (or justifier) for his already existing, deep faith.  Taleb needs to read Pascal's book again.    Taleb is a smart and intelligent man, but he needs to become a wise man.
0143038583|4.0|Very good book.  First part way to long.  Best is last or last is best -- hunting with Angelo Garro and making a meal almost all forraged by  Pollan. But his unfounded guilt for eating meat ran throughout the book.  While his title acknowledges that humans are omnivores, political correctness eats at him.    I learned a lot.  I would hope that Pollan did too.
B00005QCVT|5.0|This is the No. 1 movie in my DVD collection. The movie tells the story of 3 friends and their common interest Heroin. The last 10 minutes of the movie will make you freeze in your chair. Darren Aronofsky (Pi) did a wonderful job with this movie. 5/5 for this movie. (If you don't like sad movies with sad endings I don't recommend this one)
B00005JLRT|2.0|I am not sure what they hell they were thinking with this movie, but the only thing I can say is its better than Insurrection, of course if you have seen Insurrection you would know that isn't saying much.    This movie and Insurrection all but killed the Star Trek movie franchise, with a reboot film now in production hopefully it will redeem this historic sci fi series.    If you are looking for a good Star Trek film try part 2 The Wrath of Kahn, the best of the films, though most of the ones with the original crew are good. The best of the TNG crew is First Contact, though Generations is worth a look.    As a completist I will likely at some point buy this film, but for other people I do not recommend this film at all.
0618680004|5.0|After watching Dawkins interviewed in the BBC World few months ago, I was eager to read his book. I consider Dawkins one of the great minds today and in this book, he succesfully tackles all the important issues about religion and the nature of God. His powerful reasoning and his elegant way of explanation makes this book totally readable, providing hints for someone to make his own research.<br /><br />Some religions make a great work with poor and ill people, but when you learned more about its Theology, \\"convinced\\" is a word I would not use. Despite the later, I cannot be an Atheist...our genes will continue to propagate, we will continue improving our knowledge, but this not reduce the chances for Humans to be erased from this world, since we are living in a harsh Universe. In my little time in this universe, I rather believe there is something else, not because I want to live for ever, but because I think we will not have the time to explain everything.
B0007Y08PQ|1.0|Without a doubt the worst Trek fims ever made, This movie and Nemesis practically killed the Star Trek movie franchise.    While I may buy this to complete my collection I would not recommend even renting it, let alone buying this film.    Try ANY of the other Trek films instead.

Director Brad Bird (The Incredibles) again demonstrated a greater facility for witty, heartfelt storytelling than most of his live-action peers.<br />I will own this movie.  Good, clean, laughable fun for the whole family.

However, I borrowed my friend's 300 on blu-ray and the picture quality is awful. I'm not bashing on blu-ray because I do enjoy the rest of my blu-ray movies such as apocalypto and planet earth.

B000002J1M|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Genesis, at least in his good years with Gabriel and early Collins, was one of the very few progressive rock bands which standed in top of musical acclaim and fame too, and Foxtrot takes the prize of giving a strong mainstream success to the band, making breakthrough in U.K. charts, although not in the U.S., and also possessing a very strong critical acclaim, having their most mellodic but memorable, complex but comprehensible style throughout their albums, and this is just a fact that can be proved taking their other masterpieces into comparison, just like early trespass was very cerebral but not commercially intelligent, just the same as Selling England By The Pound, and unlike The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, its complex and thematic as well but it can be splitted in songs, Lamb Lies Down is very difficult to hear one song without the entire album, so Foxtrot is left as their breakthrough album, giving to them a more consistent national fame (U.K.) and also keeping a fantastic critical acclaim and musical intelligence.<br /><br />Foxtrot takes the progressive rock genre into a higher fame and popularity, instead of just a cultural following, its progressive rock content is a very enjoyable and comprehensible one, but its also a delicate, cultural and complex work, having a fantastic cohersion among its tracks. Its a very inspired work too, and it doesn't assumes any change in their musical directions, their light and undertaking first experience has always been present even in their best works, so Genesis' mellodic and undertaking touch to progressive rock is one of their key features to rising fame and popularity. Also their majestic and theatrical moods are present in Foxtrot, giving to the album the perfect touch of seriousness and complex sounds, with its poetical lyrics and slight theatrical and cerebral moods, just like those seen in Trespass. And of course, the presence of Nursery Crime influence is very present, although it doesn't has any effort to fit into their own sound and style, as the classic lineup was already well stablished and ready to launch. Foxtrot moods range between comprehensive, good natured, literal, potent, fierceful, thematic, enjoyable, cerebral, complex and intelligent moods.<br /><br />The songs' compositions are certainly their most fresh and inspired ones, as they were already well stablished they could focus with a delicate and sane mood. Although not regarded as a concept album, Foxtrot contains in almost each track an emotional story, some of them based even on real legends or tales, and when the songs tell tales, is like getting the satisfaction of reading a book and listening to music. Each track's composition is a very delicate and mature one, or well, not as dedicate as Trespass, but this one of its best aspects, as they kept their compositions with intelligence and beauty, Foxtrot keeps some of the detailed 70's mood, in which the bands' best works was done while they were young, intelligent and kept that fresh potential of youth, and of course, this is recognized far too many years later, so the actual albums of new bands will surely be reflected best in 20 years, or at least I hope so. Anyway, every track is a potent, delicate and good natured one, and some range among Genesis' most acclaimed and remembered ones, and of course, some stand better than other ones, just like the potent magic and sincerity in the opening Watcher Of The Skies, it ranges among my personal favourites ever, apart from keeping a fierceful hard-rocking performance, its one of their most acclaimed and enjoyable songs, having one of the most incredible uses of mellotron in the song's instrumental intro, it even pass over some artists' performance that had treated with the instrument all their lives, King Crimson for example, also check it out live, but if you're looking truely for cerebral but enjoyable songs that tells imaginative stories you must hear Get'Em Out By Friday, which stands asa beautiful song with different twists and turns among its phases, passing through the fierceful, organ-crafted chorus, which if you've heard Trespass The Knife you'll find similarity, through very emotional, sad or melancholic parts, it depends on wich part you're hearing so it is a must to read the lyrics with close attention, its conceptual lyrics tells a fictional story about commercial brutality as a president of enterprises force the people living in a block to move out of their homes, and how later in future how this zone gets affected by a gene that makes people short in height, and how its commercial brutality expands as they acclaim that twice people can live in the zone; later it comes the 22 minutes long time masterpiece Supper's Ready, ironically a favourite in live performances, which is not much of a consistent story, although it goes through different phases, like the folkish style in Lover's Leap, going through the emotional The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man, through the powerful Ikhnaton And Itsacon and their band of Merry men, through the dramatic fall of How Dare I Be So Beautiful? through the freaky emotion in Willow Farm, going to the repetitive but chilly Apocalypse In 9/8, and finally through the recalling As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs. Although I've heard other very long prog songs, this is one of my least favourites, is excellent, but it just gets a little bit boring, and its twists and turns not help a lot for keeping my attention, I preffer Van Der Graf Generator A Plague Of Lighthouse Keepers, personal opinion. Time Table was one of my personal favourites, it remains as a depressing, conceptual and theatrical song very much alike with Trespass' style, and the undertaking Can Utility And The Coast Liners is an enjoyable, literate song wich has its moments, and the instrumental break Horizons is an acoustic guitar solo interlude, mainly for preparing you to the big listen of Supper's Ready. Track pick: Watcher Of The Skies, Get'Em Out By Friday, Supper's Ready.<br /><br />As the classic linup of Gabriel, Collins, Hackett, Rutherford and Banks had already their first trying with Nursery Crime, Foxtrot is a much more consistent album, this is were Banks real ability in keyboards and mellotrons is shown, Hacket's guitar performace is dreamy and fabulous, Rutherford use of bass pedals is a highlight, and Collins' drums are echoing and hard, he was good at this time but for his best drumming performance see his Brand X' Unorthodox Behavior.<br /><br />In conclussion, finally, Foxtrot is their represent of mainstream success, commercial inteligence, critical acclaim, and a musical stability that is difficult to see in other bands, it remains as one of my most memorable and favourite albums.<br /><br />P.S.: the album's cover is one of the most dreamy and thoughtfully evocative illustrations that has been released in an album, just represents Foxtrot real face!with different twists and turns among its phases, passing through the fierceful, organ-crafted chorus, which if you've heard Trespass The Knife you'll find similarity, through very emotional, sad or melancholic parts, it depends on wich part you're hearing so it is a must to read the lyrics with close attention, its conceptual lyrics tells a fictional story about commercial brutality as a president of enterprises force the people living in a block to move out of their homes, and how later in future how this zone gets affected by a gene that makes people short in height, and how its commercial brutality expands as they acclaim that twice people can live in the zone; later it comes the 22 minutes long time masterpiece Supper's Ready, ironically a favourite in live performances, which is not much of a consistent story, although it goes through different phases, like the folkish style in Lover's Leap, going through the emotional The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man, through the powerful Ikhnaton And Itsacon and their band of Merry men, through the dramatic fall of How Dare I Be So Beautiful? through the freaky emotion in Willow Farm, going to the repetitive but chilly Apocalypse In 9/8, and finally through the recalling As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs.

B00005JKBC|4.0|My Profile: 43 yo (and getting better), no qualifications whatsoever as a movie critic<br /><br />I never get tired of watching this movie, the tutor apprenticce relantionship is superb and I think the documentation on the inner works of the CIA and their everyday lives of their field operatives is very well researched and credible.<br /><br />The movie has many plots in which to recreate on, the acting of both Pitt and redford is superb and one can appreciate the strong bonding that they make.. a bond that holds no mater if Pitts character goes roge and is left to his own death by the CIA, but the fundamental role is undeniably in the hands of Redford, who under inmense pressure is able t use the CIA owns inner strings to conduct the game he wants to be played, it is mixture of skill, inside knowledge and at the same time an act of redemtion, for Redford's character is in his last days on the CIA prior to retirement, we see a man that now is tired of playing the office game and seeing how the world he once help construct (thorugh dubious schemes) is now meaningless and devoid.<br /><br />You could also see a healthy critisism of the CIA unescrupulus tactics in scenarios we are now prone to forget such as the cold war and the lebanon of the civil war of the late 70s... yet to me this is not a movie designed to expose a political angle, I guess today this sort of movie would be censored for it may carry a message that may weaken institutional moral against terrorism, or some croc along those lines.<br /><br />This is rare glimpse at aworld of spies not taylored to the glamour that hollywood highlits of a marvel james Bond type of hero, we see real people, facing friendship, love, political backstabbing, alienation, etc.
B000002NZO|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Genesis' real introduction to the world of music was shown with the marvelous, intricate Trespass, being released in 1970, it is a great (and much better) transition from the beatles' pop, undertaking style shown in From Genesis To Revelation, changing in a beautiful way to cultural progressive rock, FAR much better. Its still one of their firsts and difficult to remember (or even difficult to find), but even though Genesis' classic lineup wasn't yet formed, the virtuosity of long time members Peter Gabriel, Anthony Banks and Mike Rutherford is shown in their very first expressions, keeping a remarkable fresh and dreamy style, and even member Anthony Phillips gave the album a fierceful and delicate touch. This is certainly a cultural album, dignified to collect, but this is were Genesis shown their true expressions of musical genious, extremely good and very appreciateable.<br /><br />Trespass is not in form a concept album, but it does assume an ambient of the renaissance era, having a very cerebral composition and a dramatic style, yet the ambient of the album is shown in its poetical lyrics and its theatrical way of playing music, but even though this aspects are fantastic and appreciatable, its also the core of professional crude critics and such low reviews, I really don't seem to get it! Anyway, Trespass is Genesis' first true album, as far as I'm concerned I've never heard From Genesis To Revelation, and I don't doubt it may be a good album, but still its a very difficult one, their critics about pop with certain orchestral arrengements goes just like Elton John's Empty Sky, a forgotten miss, and when producer John Anthony came into producing Genesis, and with the entry of percussionist John Mayhew, they seemed to realize what kind of music they were really able to play, and this is the result, a tremendous progressive rock album, with some soft but consistent inclinnations but certainly a theatrical and intricate one, that came to be a really ignored album, what an irony! Trespass keeps a scent of originality and still an influenced touch, having cerebral, intricate, complex, thoughtful, emotional, dramatic, cultural, delicate, theatrical, fierceful, peaceful and fierceful moods.<br /><br />All the 6 songs have a very delicate and beautiful composition, each one keeps its moments, although the cohersion of the album is perfect, every song fit perfectly but there are some that are certainly a highlight, just like the dramatic and fierceful Looking For Someone, my title line was extracted from a fragment of the song, and its such an emotional and thoughtful song with certainly beautiful lyrics, its also the most memorable one, along with the mellow, beautiful and mellodic Visions Of Angels, its a song wich keeps very few traces from the past album, but remains as one of my favourites, a true hymn for humanity; and last but not least, the incredible, fierceful, potent and aggresive The Knife, its one of their very first musical acclaims, the only one that made it better than the other songs, it recalls a fierceful theme of battle, full of emotions, also being a 9 minutes long but consistent piece of art. The rest of the tracks are also fantastic and beautiful as well, there not a bad song in the whole album, but some are just better, like the focused magic of White Mountain, which tells a mytic fable of a wolf, the instruments are played so nicely that you can feel perfectly the mytic ambient they try to express, and from here you can go to Stagnation, its another slightly acclaimed song, although it possess a majestic beauty and an exotic, intricate performance, it has a lot of twist and turns, going from beautiful and inspirational falsettos to a heavy musical bridge, and so on; I admit that Dusk is my least favourite, its the most short and dullest one, although its a calm interlude song for preparing the listener for such a hard song as The Knife. Track pick: Looking For Someone, Visions Of Angels,The Knife.<br /><br />At this time Genesis' lineup had already been changed, Trespass is the last album without their classic lineup, later in Nursery Crime they would be Collins, Gabriel, Hackett, Rutherford and Banks, so this maybe another reason of Trespass' bad critics, but the performance is as delightful as any other album, I even can say a lot of albums that come after this one, just as the impressive and extremely potent performance of drummer John Mayhew, and the fantastic work of Anthony Phillips, one of Genesis' most virtuous musicians, and just as Peter Gabriel fantastic flute and vocal ability (but not the best one; for his best listen to The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway), or Mike Rutherford listenable bass and Banks remarkable organ and piano, and its to regard that the organ was a popular rock instrument by that time (The Doors, Van Der Graaf Generator, etc). A touch of the band Renaissance is also influenced, and when you've heard certain VDGG albums, I realize that a lot of their Genesis' inspiration comes from this album.<br /><br />In conclussion Trespass assumes the start of Genesis' musical intelligence, beauty and detailed composition, there's nothing to waste on this album, and its still a fantastic piece for the classic rock collection.this time Genesis' lineup had already been changed, Trespass is the last album without their classic lineup, later in Nursery Crime they would be Collins, Gabriel, Hackett, Rutherford and Banks, so this maybe another reason of Trespass' bad critics, but the performance is as delightful as any other album, I even can say a lot of albums that come after this one, just as the impressive and extremely potent performance of drummer John Mayhew, and the fantastic work of Anthony Phillips, one of Genesis' most virtuous musicians, and just as Peter Gabriel fantastic flute and vocal ability (but not the best one; for his best listen to The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway), or Mike Rutherford listenable bass and Banks remarkable organ and piano, and its to regard that the organ was a popular rock instrument by that time (The Doors, Van Der Graaf Generator, etc).

B000002ACR|5.0|This is a beautiful album. I think it's the best album the Byrds ever did.<br />The songwriting here is amazingly consistent: Crosby adds the best song, his wistful, vague Everybody's Been Burned - it's one of my very favorite Byrds tracks. It's also one of Crosby's best compositions, up there with Triad and some of his Crosby, Stills & Nash tracks. There's also a classic cynical attack on the rock industry with a jazzy trumpet part (So You Want to be a Rock 'n' Roll Star); a few ethereal folk-rockers with lovely harmonies (Have You Seen Her Face?; Renaissance Fair; Time Between; Thoughts and Words), and my personal favorite of the Byrds' Dylan covers, My Back Pages. I personally think the title of this album was inspired by the \\"Older than/younger now\\" theme that Dylan's song presents. There's even a space-rocker, sort of like the tracks from their last album (Fifth Dimension), and it's tremendous (CTA - 102). I'm not a fan of Mind Gardens - it hasn't held up very well - but other than that this is a triumph. Not as experimental as Fifth Dimension was, but it's far more consistent - though Fifth Dimension was a strong album as well (if you haven't heard the title track; Eight Miles High; Mr. Spaceman and I Come and Stand at Every Door... well, you're missing out).<br />I'll admit I'm a Crosby-era purist when it comes to the Byrds, and I think their later albums are a massive drop-off from this one. However, each of the group's first four albums have something to offer, this in particular. Melodious, well-written and perfectly harmonized. A classic and masterpiece.
B000002MTR|2.0|The year was 1994, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers were on their way to world domination. 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magik had just catapulted the group into public attention, boasting four smash hits (Give it Away; Under the Bridge; Breaking the Girl; Suck My Kiss), and a wealth of solid album tracks (If You Have to Ask; Funky Monks; I Could Have Lied; Mellowship Slinky in B Major; My Lovely Man; the hilariously tasteless Sir Psycho Sexy). And John Frusciante was proving himself among the most talented guitar players of his generation.<br /><br />Then, just like that, he left to battle his drug addiction. And that's where our story begins.<br /><br />For reasons unbeknownst to me, Dave Narravo of the then-recently disbanded (soon to reform, disband, reform, and disband several times more) Jane's Addiction took over the guitar slot. I am a fan of JA - in several senses, I prefer them to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. But the two groups are massively different, and Dave Narravo's massively eclectic style doesn't fit in well with the Red Hot Chili Peppers - psychedelia, metal, folk, funk, and jazz work their way into his playing, and RHCP has yet to seriously tackle four of the five mentioned genres (Rock? Yes, but not metal). Jane's Addiction is, to me, a far more artsy group than RHCP, not a knock against the Chilis - I just can't picture them recording something like Ritual de lo Habitual.<br />Now, there are several strong singles on One Hot Minute, and if it weren't for the wealth of failed experiments here this would get three stars because of them. Warped is loud, in-your-face funk-rock; Aeroplane is a bit more mellow, has a great chorus, and has a cute part where kids start singing along (I used to sing with it myself when I was six, back before I knew what the term \\"M*****f*****\\" meant); My Friends is folk-rock-pop, kind of like Under the Bridge. That's why it gets criticized a lot, but I really like it. Either it or Aeroplane is the best song on this album. Flea is one of my favorite bassists, and I love his two bass solos on Coffee Shop. Finally, Tearjerker is a wonderful eulogy to (according to what I've heard) Kurt Cobain. The only track I like that wasn't released as a single was the quiet pacifist song Pea, sung by Flea. Cool song!<br />Now, for the bad, which translates to \\"the rest of the album\\". Deep Kick is one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life. For one, it's six-and-a-half minutes long, and almost two of those minutes are taken up by a stupid monolog. For another, it is void of any new ideas. For a third, the lyrics are stupid. Come on, the main hook is, \\"Oh s***\\", if you needed an idea of the intelligence level you're looking at here. The title track and One Big Mob aren't much better, either: particularly not the latter, which has a bunch of basso-profundo chanting uncomfortably close to the Slovak days. And Dave's psychedelic guitar sounds frustratingly out-of-place on the likes of Walkabout, Falling into Grace and Shallow Be Thy Game. Oh, and the album art's just weird. It's like a children's book that would be written by that creepy old guy who hangs out alone near playgrounds and offers little kids he doesn't know candy and a ride home without even bothering to ask where the little kid in question lives.<br />Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Californication, By the Way and Stadium Arcadium are all great records. Same with Nothing's Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual. This cannot stand with them.sists, and I love his two bass solos on Coffee Shop.

0385522401|5.0|Ian McEwan is a master of atmospheric writing, taking a seemingly isolated incident and building a story around it in a way that the reader completely lives in the moment described by his novel. He selects strange topics and then makes them feel so familiar by comparison to each of our lives that exploring the dense background he paints pulls us in like a strong magnet.  Reading McEwan is one of the rare pleasures literature lovers find.  Few writers of today can match his quiet, subtle, but bravura technique.<br /><br />ON CHESIL BEACH is essentially a study of a wedding night, a night when the two characters involved approach the virginal consummation of their marriage with disastrous results.  Florence is bright, a gifted violinist, beautiful and fragile in affairs of the heart and senses: she is frigid.  Edward, her new husband, is of lower class than she, but has reached a degree of education and overcome some thorny family obstacles to become a young bridegroom longing for his marriage night, a night he blunders with premature ejaculation.  McEwan leads into this evening and its subsequent resolution on Chesil Beach with delicate prose, brings us to the topic of climax, and then offers flashes of background of each of his characters that allows us to understand the subsequent course of events 'doing nothing' brings.<br /><br />In beautiful prose, stunningly elegant writing, and rich observations of life in the early 1960s with all that the decade of 'enlightenment' and changes in England and the world produced, Ian McEwan has created another masterpiece. Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, August 07

The real secret to appriciateing the songs is simply to listen to the lyrics, this is not an album to play in the background but one to listen to.    In my opinion this is one of the best albums I have ever bought, nearing the quality one finds in the too-short Raconteurs album.  Which Jack was a part of.
6304711905|5.0|This is an absolutely entertaining Western. With an ensemble of cast and characters made in cowboy heaven, it gives this movie the right mixture of creative acting. Kurt Russell portrays Wyatt Earp splendidly. Val Kilmer adds just the right amount of humor and spice needed to captivate and charm the viewers. Sam Elliott does what Sam Elliott do best...portray his character with that old world western appeal. This movie is, by far, very entertaining, very familiar, very captivating. My family and I enjoy watching this movie over and over again. It is definitely a must-have for any movie lover's collection.
0743496728|5.0|I have never read Jodi Picoult before.  I've read summaries of her books but they always seem so depressing to me.  I don't even know what it was that made my buy NINETEEN MINUTES, but I'm so glad that I did!    I truly think this is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  Sadly, I read the book right around the time our country was facing a similar situation, one I think Ms. Picoult handled with remarkable strength.    The characters were well developed and I liked how the story went back & forth between the past & current day.  Readers are allowed to base their own opinions on whether or not the shooter should be sympathized with or greatly disliked.  Similarities between this novel and events in real life, only go to show how wonderful of an author Jodi Picoult truly is.  I don't think she stole anything from history.  Rather, she based her story and characters on similar real-life events.      It may not be an easy book for parents to read, but I truly believe its one that most of us should.  There are children like Peter in every school across this country, and maybe if we paid more attention to these situations, we'd have less incidents like Columbine and Virgina Tech.    I look forward to future novels from Jodi Picoult, as well as going back to read a few other of her Best Selling novels (next up for me - MY SISTER'S KEEPER!)
B000002J1O|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Genesis came out being one of the most acclaimed bands by the 70's, still their majestic way of playing music wasn't yet accomplished in the U.S., and after such a versatile masterpiece as Foxtrot, Genesis released another monumental album, Selling England By The Pound, while I don't enjoy it as I enjoy Foxtrot or A Trick Of The Tail, its one of the most undertaking, flawless and acclaimed progressive rock albums of all time, not widely recognized but surely among Genesis unique works. It would have been even better if it would've been released before Genesis Live, imagine these beautiful and delicate songs in the magic of a live performance, although just as another reviewer mentioned, when playing live a song like The Battle Of The Epping Forest I'm sure Gabriel would've stayed without his breath! Anyway this album stays at the top of their careers, a flawless and delicate one, still difficult but one of their few true masterpieces.<br /><br />Selling England By The Pound is yet a difficult album to comprehend, accomplishing beautiful compositions that range between a non exagerated profound mood, along with humourous pieces and comprehensible, versatile and flawless style. While not being a concept album, it remains as an album focused on England's exceptional appearance around the XIX century, best expressed in its two first songs. The progressive rock genre domines the record, being a literate, cerebral and cultural style, but still it gets in balance with the extensive undertaking, comprehensible and even humourous pieces throughout the album, although the performance is a softer and mature one, less rocking than their previous album and less conceptual than The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, but just between these two, yet a focused one. The album's moods are cultural, cerebral, literal, complex, conceptual, delicate, refined, undertaking and emotional.<br /><br />Selling England By The Pound contains 8 tracks, each of them very original and with its unique moments, personally I recommend best of all 3 songs: the opening track, Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, stays as one of their most mellodic, memorable, beautiful and original compositions of all time, its 8 minutes long so its enjoyable for a long while but doesn't get boring, it starts with a vocal introduction by Gabriel, just like if they were going to sing an hymn, and it later goes getting louder and more progressive, performing yet their most hard rocking instrumental fragment at the end of the line \\"knights of the green shields stamp and shout\\", later going to the memorable awkward chorus, which stays as a lighter one; the fifth song, The Battle Of The Epping Forest, is one of their most acclaimed songs, being the longest composition in the album (11:40), its isn't much of a cerebral or cultural song, its most of all a light, undertaking and even humourous song! Its theme is about 2 rival gangs fighting over a territory, what does it has to do with the England of XIX? I still wonder that but its changing tempo, overwhelming, story-telling lyrics and the refined and enjoyable way Peter Gabriel interprets different voices of the lyrics' characters gives to the song the perfect touch; and the last one among the best ones, Cinema Show, well, its such a famous and recognizeable song, a very comprehensive composition with the most emotional and beautiful melodies, it switches from a 12 string based mellody to a much more hard rocking mood near the end, a perfect song. Among the other tracks the famous first hit I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe) is a poppy and mellodic song which I personaly like very much, its enjoyable and uncompromising melodies and its chilly but fearful intro and end makes it a fantastic song, or like Firth Of Fith, which stays, at least in my opinion, as one of the weakest songs in the album, its common sang lyrics are easy to forget, although it possess an stunning instrumental solo, although the song is made just too long. More Fool Me is the first Genesis' song sang by Phil Collins, too weak in my opinion and just too simple, but its interesting to see this coincidences. After The Ordeal is an interlude instrumental mainly dominated by Banks' keyboards, it a light break after hearing such a heavy song as the previous to this, and Aisle Of Plenty stays as a reprise of the first song, not too much to say, just a reprise. Track pick: Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, The Battle Of Epping Forest, The Cinema Show.<br /><br />Among the artists' performance Peter Gabriel's brilliant vocal ability is shown in how he interprets each of the songs' emotions so perfectly, plus the characters' vocal interpretations on The Battle Of The Epping Forest is just stunning; his delicate flute is seen in certain songs. Steve Hackett is maybe the most acclaimed artist within this album, his influences and ideas gave the success the album possess, plus his guitar playing is such an original and unique performance, is really hard to describe, at least words can't express it, and if you've heard his solo album Spectral Mornings there's a lot of inspiration on this album. Rutherford echoing bass its fantastic, and Banks' keyboards and more slight organ is a feature that dominates the album. Phil Collins explosive percussion is such a remarkable highlight, specially when you hear the battle-like military style drums introduction in The Battle Of The Epping Forest.<br /><br />In conclussion Selling England By The Pound stays as a further commercial aproach to cultural but undertaking music, its widely remembered as one of Genesis best works, and one of their most acclaimed and enjoyable ones.s the first Genesis' song sang by Phil Collins, too weak in my opinion and just too simple, but its interesting to see this coincidences.

0684857219|5.0|I bought this book for a friend who had expressed some interest in body building, mainly to just get into shape.  He was very impressed with the detail and information that was included in this book.  He is doing one of the routines that was once done by Arnold, himself, and my friend tells me he's more sore then he's ever been in his life, so it must be working.  We would recommend this book to anyone looking to get into bodybuilding or to just get in shape.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|I saw this movie at the theatre and absolutely loved it. It is definitely a guys movie...lots of fighting, blood, warriorism. Heck, pretty much every woman in the movie shows her breasts...what more could a guy ask for?    Honestly though, I would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could. The main reason being the movie (HD) quality. Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the DVD, it's just they way the movie was produced...it doesn't take advantage of HD. Other than that, it is still an awesome movie with decent video quality, it just doesn't POP in HD.
B000OVLBF8|5.0|This movie is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm a big Nicholas Cage fan and this movie is right up my alley. If you're in to special effects, you'll like this movie.
B000HEZF0E|4.0|The Mission Impossible series is one of those series, like The Matrix, that really needed a remake in HD. Mission Impossible is decent but the MI2 and MI3 are absolutely gorgeous.    With my Onkyo receiver the sound quality is phenomenal. I'm not a big fan of extras but there are a decent amount if that is your thing.    If you already own the series on DVD, I would buy MI2 and MI3 in HD but don't bother with the first one...I don't think you'll notice the difference.
B000RMQH30|4.0|When we last saw Ben Harper, he dropped a pretty decent double album last album, half filled with funky grooves and the other with mellow tunes, which may have been better off as one single disk. The whole album barely went over an hour so conceivably it could have. Now Harper is back with his Innocent Criminals for a new album, Lifeline, recorded right after coming off his last tour straight to analog tape in a studio in Paris.    My guess it would be hard to be putting out album for fifteen years and only have one hit, yet it never seems to faze Harper who has never tried to recreate the funky Steal My Kisses or its limited success. The latest songs here on Lifeline sound like a mish mash of the two disks of Both Sides of the Gun into a singular not so rock, not so mellow disk. Most of the songs sound like a striped down version of seventies soul classic, very little flashes of horns, instead mostly acoustic guitars and pianos fill out the music.    On Needed You Tonight, Harper goes back and forth effortless from contained shouting to smooth vocals as if he were channeling Otis Redding. But the closest Harper comes to recreating that classic soul sound is on Heart of the Matters (not to be confused with the Don Henley song), a classic slow building song that culminates with the arrival of some backing singers to get across the great chorus and bridge at the end of the song.    Recording right off the road may have contributed to keeping the juices flowing in the Innocent Criminals because they haven't sounded better; they even come close to reaching the climax of the great Stax house band Booker T and the MG's. The groove created by the piano, electric and acoustic guitars for Put it on Me should have your toes tapping until the next time Ben and the boys go back into the studio.

032147404X|5.0|Everything S Kelby writes is always great in my opinion--and this one is good too. I am sure I will use it more later. At the time I was searching really more for the basics of photography as related to my camera and camera theory in general--but I have found someone to help me there. I am very glad I purchased this book that will help me more and more as I learn about photography.
B0000AI45P|5.0|This is one cool record. It's also weird. Really, really weird. A lot of people say it's a proto-punk album, but I don't know what any of these songs have to do with punk; the synthesizer (or is it a guitar?) solo on \\"Venus\\" and the jerky rhythms of \\"See No Evil\\" - two of the album's best songs, if you were curious - have more to do with new wave than punk. Then again, the sweeping, magical title track, mostly a guitar odyssey (and, at over ten minutes, they allow themselves a lot of time to solo), doesn't have much to do with New Wave. So we'll call this a country-polka album. Who cares about classification, anyway? \\"Marquee Moon\\" itself is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard: the verse section is beautiful, and the interlocking guitar solos are wonderful. It's like going to Heaven and staying there for eleven minutes. Continuing on, the group often writes some very interesting lyrics (\\"Friction\\"), and is just as capable in creating a wonderful atmosphere (the dreamy \\"Elevation\\"; the airy \\"Guiding Light\\", which has some serious guitar solos; the dark closer \\"Torn Curtain\\") thanks to their odd choice of guitar tones: they really do make their axes sound otherworldly. This was too quirky upon original release to make any impact on the charts, but these days it's justly considered a classic album. If this sounds like anything by the Velvet Underground to you, it's no surprise, because I can hear a VU influence in this group. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest albums ever made, and even though it's been out for thirty-odd years, I have yet to hear anything that sounds like it. I have to give this the highest recommendation possible, a classic album by an underrated band.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|\\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is Rihanna's third CD, but the only I have (or will) purchase(d). It's not a bad CD, but it lacks sincerity. Rihanna doesn't put a lot of emotion into these songs, and some of them sound incredibly forced. 75% of this rating pretty much goes towards the production, since, aside from singing, Rihanna didn't really do much else. Now, I could understand if this was her debut CD...but this is her third. If she's going to \\"just sing\\", then she could at least sing well.    The album opens up \\"Umbrella.\\" I'm sure everyone has heard this song by now. It has an interesting sound, if overproduced, but Rihanna's vocals do sound good here. The improvement in her voice definitely shows.    \\"Push Up On Me\\" isn't a favorite of mine, but a lot of other people seem to like it. It's a nice dance song, if simple in the beginning.    \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" is my favorite song from the album. Rihanna's vocals are perfect for this kind of song. It's interesting and the production is on point. The Michael Jackson sample doesn't hurt, either.    \\"Breaking Dishes\\" is another favorite. This is one of the few songs where Rihanna actually displays some kind of human emotion (it must've been difficult for her). The vocals are nice, but unfortunately, the production is better (which becomes a reoccurring theme through the album).    \\"Shut Up and Drive\\" is a bit weaker than \\"Breaking Dishes\\", but it's not bad. Unfortunately however, Rihanna's vocals sort of vanishes at some points during the songs.    \\"Hate that I Love You\\" doesn't seem to be a favorite among fans, but personally, this song is why I even bought the CD. Vocally, this is Rihanna's best song, though the production sounds like a remix of \\"Because of You\\"....which sounded like a remix of \\"Sexy Love\\", which then sounded like a remix of \\"So Sick.\\" I am not a fan of Ne-yo (though he is talented), but nonetheless, that did not stop me from enjoying the song.    \\"Say It\\" is a sweet song. I like it, but I agree with theindividual who said it could've been sung by anyone and it would still sound the same.    \\"Sell Me Candy\\" is another album high-light. The production is on point. Rihanna's vocals flow with the song perfectly.     \\"Lemme Get That\\" is a fun song. I'm not exactly sure what Rihanna is doing with her voice, however. Furthermore, her delivery is incredibly forced. I don't take her seriously in this song at all. However, once again, the production is on point.    \\"Rehab\\" is a song liked by fans, but honestly, I think this is without a doubt the worst song on the CD. Really, it's horrible. The lyrics are there, the production is there, but the vocals... Jesus. Rihanna's vocal short-comings become glaringly obvious here. This is one of those songs that could've been really good had it been performed by someone with a huge, strong voice. Not only does Rihanna fall apart of vocally, but she doesn't show a drop of emotion here. Not one. Quite frankly, she sounds like some sort of machine. The lines sound like they're being read instead of being sung (she's that monotone. was she bored???). Personally, I think the only reason this song made the cut was because it was written by Justin Timberlake.     \\"Question Existing\\" is an interesting song, for lack of a better word. I like the diary part. \\"Hey Robin.\\" It kind of made me feel for her.    \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" ends the album nicely. I love the lyrics. \\"Once a good girl goes bad....she's gone forever.\\" It makes since, but a lot of guys, unfortunately, do not treat their woman right.     OVERALL, this is a solid album. \\"Say It\\" is rather mediocre, but it's still enjoyable, however \\"Rehab\\" is horrible. I don't like to be rude, but Rihanna really butchered that song.    I do think this CD is a little overrated, however. It's good, but at one point the CD had nearly five stars here. It's not even close to being that good, because while the production is there, the vocals still could use a bit of work. Rihanna is by no means a horrible singer. She's good, but she's not exactly a powerhouse vocalist, so why she was given songs that are obviously too big for her is beyond me. However, I think Rihanna's biggest problem is her lack of emotion. Her voice \\"sounds\\" interesting, but her delivery is rather dull. Rihanna is only 19, so she has potential. She'll definitely improve with age and experience.    Nonetheless, if you want fun, entertaining dance pop, then is for you. It's no \\"Loose\\", but it's decent, nonetheless.    Favorites:    Don't Stop the Music  Breaking Dishes  Shut Up and Drive  Say It  Sell Me Candy    Scrap:    Rehab

0345350499|5.0|For me, this wasn't just a book, but a real life changing experience. As a Wiccan, I found this retelling of King Arthur just totally fascinating and absorbing. Bradley literally makes this world come to life around you. I understand that some feel this is an overally feminist novel, but I really didn't feel that way. There are plenty of wonderful male characters in this book. If she doesn't expand upon them as she does the females, it's because this book is from a female point of view. I just adore this book and my only real complaint is that I hadn't read it years earlier.
B000FVQYYK|3.0|Black Holes and Revelations is fair. I think Origin of Symmetry and Absolution are much better, with the latter being the best effort to date. The album is a bit political. Been there, heard that. Is it just fashion that artists have to spout their political views?
B000RJO57I|5.0|Out of all the comedies I have seen, this is the best. It is the most original, the most well thought out, and just the most outright hilarious movie I have seen. The British accents, culture, characters, and settings make this comedy exceedingly unique and are a breath of fresh air when compared to the same old American settings(Hollywood), actors(Wilson, Stiller,Vaughn,etc.), and culture. Besides the comedy segments, this movie actually has substance and as many different qualities as any movie can have: action, adventure, drama, mystery, comedy, and suspense. As a caveat, this movie will be too unique and intelligent for some people who only like comedies based on people getting hurt or wearing funny clothes. Disclaimer - this movie contains intensely hilarious scenes that may cause some people to lose their breath or pull a muscle from laughing; the only remedy is to step out of the theater and take deep breaths.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I have never been as excited about a documentary as I have been with Planet Earth. The series is so capivating I did not want to pause it to go to the restroom. I must commend the photographs and all involved in its production. What a magnificent display of our world land and sea. This is an excellent way to travel with your children to places you may never see otherwise.
B000R4SMCW|3.0|This ho-hum thriller starts slowly, once Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) shoots his wife for cheating on him.  Young prosecutor Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is assigned the case - believed to be an easy and immediate conviction - as he is about to leave for a lucrative corporate law position.  A game of cat and mouse ensues between Willy and the arrogant and educated Ted, once Ted gets all the evidence against himself thrown out of court.  The ending is fairly interesting, but it's a long, slow haul to get there.  In between, the viewer must endure a stale romance between Willy and his new boss - an anorexic blond with the charisma of cardboard whose only acting skills are opening her gaunt eyes wide and intensely staring at Willy as if he was a sandwich she would kill to get a bite of.  Hopkins sleepwalks through a toned down version of Hannibal Lector, albeit without the interesting homicidal nuances of that character.  And Gosling, who showed he has true talent in Murder by Numbers - seems to flounder as a lower class, Midwesterner clawing his way to the top in LA.  His accent and body language feel forced, and he isn't ever believable as a successful attorney.  The whole movie has the feel of trying too hard, yet never quite succeeding at gripping the audience.

006085880X|3.0|I just finished listening to this book after reading several other Picoult books this month.  While the plotline was fairly good, I found a few inconsistencies that made me wonder how well edited this book really was before it went to print.  How far apart were Chris and Emily's births?  Six or three months?  The book offers both answers.  There were two characters named Donna, which made it confusing and she used the same adjectives and adverbs over and over and over again.  That said, what I found most disturbing was that she used two of the exact same scenes from this book and transplanted them into Nineteen Minutes.  It leads me to believe that if you've read one Picoult novel, you may have read every element for them all.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|don't let the bad cover art fool you.  I saw this in the theaters and bought it immediately when it came out on DVD.  A powerful film.  To say any more to be to give it away.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I really, really wanted to like this album.  I just loved LP as it was like pretty much the best \\"recent\\" hard stuff I was listening to outside of industrial.  I was up for a LP fix and picked this up right away, w.o. checking reviews.  My dumb.<br /><br />Pros (of old LP):  fast&heavy, good use of vocal duets, nice rap-metal hooks.  Makes you want to hop around.<br /><br />Cons (of old LP):  lyrics of adolescent angst are kinda repetitive.<br /><br />This new album ditched pretty much all the good points.  It sounds like a downtempoed Metallica/Iron Maiden.  But not in a good way.  No duets, not heavy, not fast, no rap-metal (too 'dated', I guess).  Muddled, bland.  We still have the emo lyrics though.  'Cause, they're like... deep, ya know.<br /><br />I put Minutes on my smallish mp3 player so I got plenty of opportunity to listen to it.  But, as time went on, I started just skipping to the next random song each time something came up from Minutes.  Especially if running - too much of a downer.  In fact, I can't think of one song I enjoyed from Minutes.  But I especially disliked the one where \\"the crowd\\" is clapping.  Clap-machine synthesizers, more like.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with changes in a band, it's a good thing.  LP is welcome to evolve.  I just wish they had evolved in a different way, is all.  Or just stayed the same.  For fans who like Minutes:  good for you, bad for me.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie is an amazing thing to look at.  Those with an interest in Art Direction and Cinematography will have plenty to keep them interested.  The action is beautifully filmed - and you CAN describe these bloody sequences as beautiful.  The attention to detail in following the source Frank Miller comic is striking, and the team succeeded in their stated intent to \\"bring the book to life\\".  This film stands with Blade Runner as a milestone - many future projects will use what 300 has brought to the table from a visual perspective.    As a former Army sergeant, I greatly appreciated the movie's treatment of the soldiers that make the march.  The camraderie is genuine, and informs the performances of the actors involved in the battle sequences in a way I haven't seen since Saving Private Ryan.  There is also a tremendous weight placed on the perception of events from the Spartan point of view.  The fanciful nature of many of the creatures encountered during the battle made a-lot of sense to me - your eyes deceive you in battle.    The greatest strength of this film is also it's greatest weakness.  The slavish attention to detail that brings so much to the table visually falls far short in the narrative - which is to be expected in an adaptation of a graphic novel.  However, as a movie with a screenwriting team, there was an opportunity to either a) spend more time with the troops in the field and learn more about what makes them tick or b) provide greater insight into the political turmoil that faced all of Greece during the Persian invasion.  Instead, we get half of both.    All things considered, however, I take this for what it is - a beautifully filmed and unusually crafted war film.  I found it inspirational as well as entertaining, and will enjoy watching it again
B000QXDEDG|5.0|The movie \\"300\\" is obviously an embellished tale, but it was told so well in this motion picture that it makes for excellent fiction in an historical setting.<br /><br />The best features for me where the perfect coloring and lighting, the action and stunts, the story and plot, and the great acting performances.  And those basically amount to everything that is important in a movie, I gave this flic a 5-star rating.  I just don't think it could have been done better, and I think it is as good as the best films out there right now.<br /><br />To get specific, I will discuss each element noted above.<br /><br />First, the lighting and the colors used in this movie somewhat resemble what we watched in Three Kings, starring George Clooney, et al.  They are so vivid and imaginative.  They bring about a gloomy kind of existence, but a stark portrayal of characters against their ambience.  I found myself thinking, \\"those colors are really cool.\\"  This is just great work.<br /><br />Second, the action and stunts are quite fabulous and should excite anybody who liked The Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or similar action movies.  While 300 doesn't quite compare with The Matrix in terms of overall mastery of action sequences, like I said, its scenes should still excite action fans nonetheless.<br /><br />One thing that is obviously glorified in the movie 300 is the bloodbath.  This isn't just about war, violence, or standing up for what someone believes in.  In reality, this movie is about the non-stop provision of bloody, bloody sequences - and not even so much to prove a point, just to provide bloody sequences!  After all, everybody knows \\"war is hell,\\" and we've all seen war movies where there isn't even any blood!  (Of course, those are out of style now.)  But this war movie is all about blood!  This, of course, accentuates the action sequences and plot.<br /><br />So now, third, the story and plot of 300.  Both are great for the most part, but we see some very minor glitches.  (But they are easily overlooked because of all the blood - ha ha!)<br /><br />The basic story is that the Greek city-state of Sparta is confronted by the entire Persian civilization some thousands of years ago (long before Christ and separated from monotheism - keep these in mind).  Xerxes, the Persian man-god, provokes the pride of Sparta's king by giving him the simple choice: give me what I want or be destroyed.  In great fashion, the Spartan king says \\"up yours,\\" in so many words.  With integrity, the Spartan king assembles a small military force (allegedly 300 strong) and leads them to fight against tens of thousands of Persian troops and mercenaries.  He does this in the name of Sparta, his family, his beliefs, and for what is altogether good.<br /><br />The plot is simple: grand martyrs championing the cause of free men - think: Alamo... but with a lot of blood and contrasting color schemes!  Or, think of it as the modern day (gory) replacement of the old western.  (Interesting how ancient times have replaced the OK Corral in our movies, isn't it?  Goodbye, Davey Crockett and Sam Houston; hello Leonitus and Maximus.)<br /><br />Simply put, if you love the story about the Alamo (especially the romanticized version of it), then the movie \\"300\\" is for you, my friend.  And might I add, if you prefer the John Wayne version of the Alamo, then you will DEFINITELY love \\"300\\"!  This movie falls in line with what a conservative's movie library should look like.  (Of course there are exceptions, my liberal friends, but let's face it: left-wingers typically do not appreciate the masculinity in war.)<br /><br />Lastly, on the topic of actors' performances, I have to say that each person rocked it.  For movies like this, you need manly men and womanly women.  Well, you get that here.  Again, it may not be hard left-wingers that appreciate this sort of thing, but I know that there are exceptions.<br /><br />Still, each main character plays a strong role (headstrong, for sure), including the queen.  I would say that this movie vivifies the conservative ideal in nearly all aspects, writing as one.<br /><br />The supporting cast (the soldiers of the 300) are almost exact replicas of their king: brash, manly, unfearing, brave, disciplined, cavalier, and ultimately patriots.  Their banter is so perfect for this kind of movie in that any weakness in manhood would ruin the entire show.  So these characters support the overall plot by exemplifying what it means to be a martyr and fighting for what you believe in.  So, then, each soldier character increases the prestige of the leader, the main character in this story.<br /><br />To close, the movie \\"300\\" is gory, masculinist, violent, and spectacular.  If you want a modern day Alamo plus gore and graphics, you got it.  Interestingly enough, I think \\"300\\" tries to relate to American audiences more than any other audience.  You see a lot of American ideals and culture propagated here.  And again, if you are a left-winger, you might have some trouble with the conservative concept of Americanism, such as \\"God, family, country,\\" which is evident throughout this movie.<br /><br />Again, this is a 5-star movie, and I recommend it for everybody who wants a romanticized tale about manliness.  If you don't appreciate romanticized manliness, you will probably just laugh at guys like me (and this movie's typical audience member).  For those of us who do appreciate a romanticized depiction of what being a man is all about, given in an historical context, I think you will walk away from this movie thinking about it for a long time, as well as finding yourself trying to re-incorporate some aspects of manhood that have slithered away from our culture since the 1970s.rong, for sure), including the queen.

Newman is brilliant as is Tim Robbins and the supporting cast.

This doesn't mean that the book was really all that enjoyable to me either of the two times I've read this now for classes.

B0002F6AH0|4.0|The series is still priceless. I had a real problem with the DCDs themselves - being able to hear all the commentary. Sometimes it was so low that I couldn't even hear it with my ear next to the TV speaker. It may have been a problem emmanating from the VCR, but I still don't know.    I finally was able to solve the problem by hooking up my Bose radio/CD player via AUX cables. Then I used the volume on the Bose. That solved the volume problem and I have been able to enjoy the set tremendously - and learn a lot too.    I noticed the same problem with other DVD's made from old (probably) VHS. When I put a new movie on the DVD player, such as the Harry Potter movies on DVD, the sound is perfect. I think the problem lies with the old programs that are redone onto DVD.

B000H5V8DG|1.0|Simply, if you are a collector, don't buy this set. It has an essential designing defect. for example there is not even one simple DVD in this box that you can find defectless. all of them are scratched because of wrong desiging of Disc holders, Some have been caused scratches during the packaging line, some in transportation and some at the first time you pull each of them out!. worse is, there are finger prints on many of discs. Box is very good looking inside out, maybe unique but when you want to pull out a disc and play it and when you see the scratches all over not most, ALL OF THEM, you feel you want to throw it out in trashcan! Yes it comes in shrink wrapp but in Amazon terms, it's status is \\"ACCEPTABLE\\" not \\"NEW\\". if they sell it at the price of 30 to 40 dollars it may worth it but in this price buying it just like you roll you money and light is as a cigar!

0142000671|5.0|What makes a big book? Not physical length. Knowing this novel's reputation as one of Steinbeck's masterpieces, I was astounded to lay hands on its mere hundred pages. Not scale of setting, either. The entire novella takes place in and around the bunkhouse of a California farm, and contains fewer than a dozen characters; it is so compact that it might almost have been made for film, television, or the stage (and it did in fact succeed in all these media). The people, furthermore, are by no means important or powerful; Steinbeck tells of ordinary itinerant laborers, bindle stiffs, living precariously from job to job. In this, the book is similar to [[ASIN:0142000663 THE GRAPES OF WRATH]], but deliberately avoids its epic scope, preferring to show a few characters in intimate detail rather than to suggest the displacement of multitudes.<br /><br />Yet I have no hesitation in calling the book big. Without any effort or overt symbolism, Steinbeck shows something simultaneously particular and vast. His characters are individuals, very real yet bound to one another and to us through their common humanity. The novel speaks to a particular time -- the American West in the late thirties -- and yet seems timeless. It takes a specific corner of California (\\"A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green\\") and makes it a kind of oasis of simplicity, as in the marvelous opening scene where the principal characters choose to spend a night sleeping under the stars rather than arriving too soon at the farm.<br /><br />And nothing could be bigger than the heart of Lennie, the simple-minded giant who comes to the farm with his friend and protector George, but whose confused feelings and ignorance of his own strength get him into trouble. The bond between him and George is not fully explained, but it is palpably filled with a kind of love. Lennie's inability to articulate his feelings is shared by all the other characters to some extent; this is a world in which men keep themselves to themselves and move on alone. But their very inarticulateness gives their underlying emotions an almost primal power. Truly, this is a big book.is is a world in which men keep themselves to themselves and move on alone.

The fact that he has hooked up on this and other projects with Nikki Sixx of the Crue just makes it that much better.  What a stunning portrayal of addiction and (hopefully) redemption the Heroin Diaries presents.  This is a message that needs to get more airplay on major rock radio!
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This film consists of four stories that are interconnected and develop in different languages. The meaning behind the title is clear from the beginning, since the difficulty in communicating is palpable and has some serious consequences. The director I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, delivers a production that belongs to the highest echelon in terms of its artistic value, but has some elements that make it less than perfect. The movie generated a variety of conflicting emotions in me while I was watching it, and at some points I even considered stopping altogether. I am glad I did not, since even though it was not easy to stomach some portions, the final balance was clearly positive.<br /><br />The first story, which develops in Moroccan, shows a man buying a rifle and giving it to his two sons to kill jackals that accost their goats. The bullets are supposed to have a range of three kilometers, and when the kids are trying to verify this, they end up putting a shot inside a bus with tourists. This is when we get the second story, which is mainly in English. Richard and his wife are on a trip in Morocco, trying to rebuild their marriage after losing the smallest of their three kids. When the stray bullet hits Richard's wife, they are thrown into a morass of confusion, and have to manage to get help in a strange land. Meanwhile, back in the United States Amelia is taking care of Richard's kids and needs to go to the wedding of her son. Since there is nobody to take care of the children while she is gone, she decides to take them with her and her nephew. There is a factor that makes this less than straightforward though; the wedding is in Mexico. As you can guess, this third story is mostly in Spanish. Finally, the fourth story involves a deaf Japanese girl, Chieko, who is angry at her father and at most of the rest of the world, after losing her mother. This one develops in Japanese and sign language. At first there does not seem to be any connection between the story in Japan and the others, but all will be explained in due time.<br /><br />Besides the different languages used in the movie, there is a proficient use of a variety of music, which complements each portion perfectly. There is even a scene with Chieko, in which a deafening silence has an effect that is as noticeable as the music in other cases. The continuous jumping from one story to the next keeps the plot interesting and the slight time shifts are easy to follow. There were a couple of developments in the plot that really bothered me though, especially in the Spanish portion. It seemed to me that the creators were trying to get points for shock value, but they went too far and ended up losing them instead. I do not want to give away the scene I am referring to, but I am pretty confident you will spot it right away if you watch the movie.<br /><br />One of the biggest pluses I found in this film was the performances of all of the participants in the cast. Brad Pitt really surprised me, with a vivid and emotional portrayal of Richard. As usual, Cate Blanchett delivers a top notch performance, but her role requires limited screen time and renlinquishes her role almost to a secondary spot. The one that steals the prize is Gael Garcia Bernal, who plays Amelia's nephew, Santiago. He displays his usual charm and intensity in portraying a character that allows him to show his strengths as an actor.<br /><br />If you are not bothered by desperate situations, then I would say that you should definitely watch this movie. But if that is not the case, the circumstances are considerably harder to assess. I was a little bothered by some of the events, but found the experience to be satisfying, but my wife, who is more squeamish, was not able to go through with it. I hope that the review provides you with a basis to determine in which category you fall and whether you are likely to like this film.all will be explained in due time.

B00006AW2M|5.0|I wanted to buy this with my allowance when I was 13 years old but my mother wouldn't let me because of the title.  We were a good church-going family and we weren't having any of THAT in our household.  Heck, I didn't even know what the word Satanic implied at the time.  That was long ago, back when Brian Jones was still alive.  When I recently got a copy (about 37 years too late) I was convinced it wasn't going to be all that great because of all the bad things I'd read about it here and elsewhere. Rolling Stone magazine once published a scathing review \\"if it's in Rolling Stone it MUST be true!\\"  (Flo & Eddie).<br /><br />Their Satanic Majesties Request originally had a different title (Cosmic Christmas I think it was) but was changed at the last minute, presumably to stir controversy. I think the title may have been one of the things that hurt sales in the USA (we're a nation full of Bible thumpers, I'm surprised they weren't burning this one along with all those Beatle Lps); using that title was an unfortunate decision, sure to scare parents to death.  A marketing disaster really.<br /><br />For those who WERE able to sneek a copy into the house, many (most?) didn't like it.  Why?  Well unfortunately, this is one of those records where, because the band actually DID SOMETHING CREATIVE and well-outside their norm, many fans hated it.  Personally, I think it's excellent.  Like its predecessor,Between the Buttons, the Stones took some big chances with this one... well, ok, maybe much that courage came by way of being very, very stoned.  The project was also disrupted by the infamous drug-busts and unbelievable harsh sentences for Richards and Jagger.  Jones was also busted but faired a little better on his criminal complaint; hence he was pretty involved with this project.  At any rate, this is great stuff and don't mind anyone who says otherwise.  Parts sound like a precursor to King Crimson's \\"In the Court of the  Crimson King\\" and this is probably due to Jones' experiments and use of the Mellotron.  The Mellotron, for you kiddies out there, was a sort of ancient sampling device that worked using strips of magnetic tape that were released over a play-head by pressing a \\"piano\\" key!  If you have violins and cellos on the little strips of magnetic tape - presto!  A compact orchestra!<br /><br />When I hear/read the complaints about Their Satanic Majesties Request I am immediately reminded of what Frank Zappa once said about music \\"fans\\" (I will paraphrase to avoid legal concerns that Amazon might have that result in getting the review deleted:<br /><br />\\"Most people can't deal with abstract music and don't want to.  They say 'Gimme a tune. Do I like the tune?  Does it sound like some other tune that I like?' The more familiar it is the more the better I like it.  Hear those three notes there?  Those are the three notes I can sing along with.  I like those notes very, very much.  Give me a beat.  Not a fancy one.  Give me a GOOD beat.  Something I can dance to.  It has to go boom-bap, boom-boom-bap.  If it doesn't, I will hate it very, very much.  Also, I want it right away - and then, write me some more songs just like that because I'm REALLY into music.'\\"  Frank Zappa<br /><br />The song writing on Their Satanic Majesties Request is mostly very strong and the arrangements are very good.  Most folks are going to hate Sing This All Together (and see what happens). I can sort of understand that complaint though I happen to like the piece.  That particular track actually has much more in common with The Mothers of Invention's Freak Out! (The Return of the Son of the Monster Magnet) than Sgt Pepper.  Listen to Jagger's panting and the percussion, it is so much like Return of the Son of the Monster Magnet.  I can definitely hear the influence of Freak Out! which in fact was stated (both McCartney & Lennon) as a key inspiration for Sgt Pepper. Conceptually, the cover sort of resembles a Sgt Pepper kind of thing but that is reallywhere the comparisons should end.  It's an unfair and unfortunate comparison because the album's sales and popularity suffered for it.  Another \\"Zappa-esque\\" quality is the use of vocals that have been sped up to get the munchkin sound on She's A Rainbow.  These guys were definitely listening to Zappa and I think at this point, Jones had actually met the man at the Monterey Pop festival (when he introduced Hendrix in '67)<br /><br />In addition to 2000 Light Years From Home and She's A Rainbow (found on Through the Past Darkly), there is lots of great music here (notably Lantern, Gomper, 2000 Man, The Citadel - heck, the whole darn CD is great) - but it IS different.  Though it IS psychedelic, it doesn't sound particularly dated to me.  In fact, I'd say Sgt Pepper, while very good, is not only hugely overrated, it sounds much more dated than Satanic Majesties (gasp! Maude!  get my gun!  did you hear that?  that reviewer had the nerve to criticize Sgt Pepper!)<br /><br />Anyway, I love Their Satanic Majesties Request and I enjoy it a little more with each subsequent listen.  FIVE SOLID STARS regardless of what Rolling Stone Magazine once wrote...t's an unfair and unfortunate comparison because the album's sales and popularity suffered for it.   Another \\"Zappa-esque\\" quality is the use of vocals that have been sped up to get the munchkin sound on She's A Rainbow.  These guys were definitely listening to Zappa and I think at this point, Jones had actually met the man at the Monterey Pop festival (when he introduced Hendrix in '67)    In addition to 2000 Light Years From Home and She's A Rainbow (found on Through the Past Darkly), there is lots of great music here (notably Lantern, Gomper, 2000 Man, The Citadel - heck, the whole darn CD is great) - but it IS different.  Though it IS psychedelic, it doesn't sound particularly dated to me.  In fact, I'd say Sgt Pepper, while very good, is not only hugely overrated, it sounds much more dated than Satanic Majesties (gasp! Maude!  get my gun!  did you hear that?  that reviewer had the nerve to criticize Sgt Pepper!)      Anyway, I love Their Satanic Majesties Request and I enjoy it a little more with each subsequent listen.  FIVE SOLID STARS regardless of what Rolling Stone Magazine once wrote...
B000OQF6N6|5.0|It's a new sound.  Billy's voice is so cynical.  He hates suicide, he hates poison, and he hates dope.  But he also knows why they exist, and the band celebrates the last fleeting moments of the existence of our civilization.  ZEITGEIST!  Be sure to watch the Google Video documentary of the same name - a.k.a. \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\".
B000CNE092|5.0|This is the best movie-my 2 year old loves it and wants to watch it everyday.  She has all the songs from the movie memorized and sings them all the time so I had to buy the CD soundtrack too.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I didn't start watching the show until the second season and became hooked!  I now have both seasons in my personal collection and Season 3 has been pre-ordered.  It's great to have the opportunity to sit down and watch these - commercial free - whenever I want!!
1416909532|5.0|As a former private investigator, when I purchased this book, I was a bit curious as to what this book would say. When I read it, and saw just how brutally honest and straight forward Greg was in telling women the TRUTH about everything, I was plesantly surprised and appreciative that a MAN would dare to be that bold and that honest about things. I urge any teenager, woman or man to read this book for any pre-dating, divorce or widowed circumstance if they are thinking of entering the dating world. Greg said things that I myself have been telling clients in domestic cases for years!!
1567315682|4.0|A constant criticism of this book is that there is so much attention to being frugal, that one doesn't get to enjoy the benefits of one's labors.  To that I say, \\"Balderdash!\\".  You don't have to follow all of Stanley's tips to benefit tremendously from his thinking.  I love living below my means and coming up with ways to get more out of my money.<br />There were many ways I changed how I look at my life because of Stanley's insights.  Do I follow all his advice?  No. But I am the proverbial millionaire next door, and no one who meets me would ever guess.
B000MV8AE0|5.0|Somehow, I cannot get tired of this movie. Being a musician myself, I can understand the scenes where Beethoven is sharing the secrets of what music is, and the price musicians pay to bring it to life. When he told the Anna Holtz character that musicians must be conduits for the Voice of God, and \\"if we are not that, we are nothing\\", I almost wept; because it is true. Any musician that is reading this will bear witness to this.<br /><br />Beethoven was not without his faults. But his music was as powerful as life itself. And he continued to progress in his musical development until the day he died. The movie shows how he pushed the envelope with his Concerto Grosso; and nobody understood what he was doing. Until many years after he died. Now, it is how we hear music. The maestro's vision was supremely vindicated.<br /><br />Ed Harris' performance was marvelous. This, especially since he had Gary Oldman's equally fine portrayal of Beethoven to stand up to. He made the character his own without copying Oldman's method.
0441003257|5.0|One of the things not often mentioned about Pratchett is that in his humour, there is an enormous amount of sadness--so much so, that some of his work is hard to read.  Gaiman, on the other hand, is brutal, tortured, and weird....but inherently less despondent.  In that (open) vein, Gaiman is just otherworldly enough that when reading him, you feel like intentionally hitting a toe, just to come back to earth....while Pratchett, with one Buddhism-as-satire-exception, is remarkably grounded.  So, all in all, this book smooths over the objectionable bits about both authors; it's not maudlin, or, well, it is maudlin, but not in a depressing way.  It's maudlin but funny;  it's hysterical but not infused with pathos, except the funny sort of pathos....well, anyway, go read it.
B000QXDEDG|4.0|It's unlike anything I have seen before. I got bored for a couple of minutes but the action is great. Only thing I didn't like is the fact that the movie ends like there is going to be a sequel, or maybe it's just me.
0441172717|4.0|Dune is a sci-fi classic, mainstay and linchpin. The book that went on to beget follow-up chronicles, prequels, sequels and a maligned film is a complex and lengthy tour-de-force reader in the annals of science fiction although, much like its contemporary Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger In A Strange Land, it is objectively more of the latter than the former. Dune utilizes sociology, anthropology, psychology and of interest within the arena of ecology.<br /><br />Frank Herbert has created a complex universe that is alive with machinations, manoeuvring, religion, commerce and opportunity. The planet Arrakis, now bestowed to Duke Atreides of Caladan who is a cousin to the emperor, is the source for the spice drug melange which is an invaluable and a rare resource allowing interstellar navigators to fold space and travel instantaneously anywhere in the galaxy. Not unexpectedly, all is not well. The guild that controls the spice is mysterious and holds interstellar travel and melange as above mere empire matters or politics, Dune was previously ruled harshly by the Harkonnens whose Baron Vladimir has a taste for suppression of the locals (the Fremen) and brutality and is not about to abdicate his control and the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV of the house Corrino has other things in mind than generosity towards his cousin. Ultimately, it is Paul Atreides, the son of the murdered Duke Leto, who forms the centre of gravity for the book.<br /><br />Treachery, witchery, spirituality and mastery of the mysterious arts form the basis for much of what ensues on Dune where the rich and indeed deep cast of characters whips up a sandstorm in the ethos of Arrakis.<br /><br />Frank Herbert draws from many influences and cultures such as Arabic (the use of nomenclature like 'Shaddam', 'jihad' or 'Mahdi' among many others), Persian ('Padishah'), Zen (the mind opening concepts embedded in the spice, the methods employed by the Bene Gesserit or the blatant mention of the Zensunni religion) and others. The desert planet though is the scene of much action and even on a strictly superficial level Dune is never lacking in stimulation.<br /><br />Dune is a book, and the unfolding of a universe, on par with the likes of The Lord Of The Rings or Brave New World albeit with many more millennia behind it..

B000PFU7OO|4.0|Great little singer/songwriter CD.  I saw the movie and liked the music, so I decided to get the CD.  I don't regret it.  It's a great addition to my library.  Cool mellow songs that take you back to the great scenes and performances in the movie.
B000000H7I|5.0|I mostly wanted to write this review because I noticed that a number of people were saying that poor drumming lowers the quality of this album. If you are thinking of buying this album, don't let those reviews scare you off. I think the drums are amazing and fit the music perfectly. It isn't all just straightforward thrashing or blastbeats, he throws in some tasty little variations with the bass drums, and overall it is far from being overly simple or boring. It is all rock-solid in terms of timing, and the way the drums were mixed on the album sound great. I just don't understand what the critics think would fit the music better. This isn't tech metal.    Anyway, if you're at all receptive to the sounds of death metal, this album ought to hook you in about 4 seconds of listening... one of my favorites for sure!!!
0393974650|5.0|Here this book goes deep in the realm of psychology and Science fiction. Very short. But not for the short attention span. You mustn't get lost in the extremely intense personification and imagery for this will make the book monotonous.     I am a new but HUGE fan or R.L. Stevenson but this is not his best work of his stories I would suggest getting a complete tales of R.L. Stevenson collection because this would include his best work in my opinion the suicide club and rajah's diamond.    Enjoy but I suggest getting a different print of this story one that includes his greatest short stories.
B00005JPLW|5.0|It had a good price and you could not beat the shipping. Thank you very much for the good service.
0316067598|5.0|Books about the war in Iraq and Afghanistan are beginning to pile up like so many cords of wood and deciding where to start, and what to avoid is becoming more and more difficult. Luttrell's story, so far is one of the most compelling, straight forward and seemingly honest accounts of a war that is extremely difficult to fathom from this side of the world. Though he has a tendency to place much blame unfairly on the myth of a liberal press, he is entitled to his opinion. Who among us can really understand from deep within our own experiences what the true depth of emotions are at play on the battlefield. Luttrell tells his story, with some digressions that help fill in gaps, but in the end he manages to pull it all together. He is a man who has found himself full of regret and self-doubt because of a decision he made, a decision that will probably haunt him for the rest of his life, even though it was likely the right decision doesn't help mollify his emotions. This is what war is, a thousand questions without clear answers. So far \\"Lone Survivor\\" is the best personal account of this very confusing war, and it comes from a combat vet not a politician, a general watching from the green zone or talk show screed by someone who doesn't have a true or clear view of the harsh, unforgiving reality of war.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I fell in love with this watch just by looking at it in a retail store, and trying it on just confirmed it. Of course, Amazon's price was about half of the store's, so that convinced me.    Only problem is that you have to read the directions to figure out the band. The clasp is tricky the first time if you haven't, but is very simple once you see the sequence.
1931559317|5.0|This atlas fills a real need for a pocket atlas that is easily carried and consulted in the field. Highly recommended.
B00005JPQR|5.0|We have come to expect nothing less than excellence from the Bourne series and Ultimatum delivers. The acting and writing are concise and right on. I love the constant switching of the filming from hand-held to still to blur to panning, etc. The stunts are thrilling in the very best sense of the word; unrelenting, fresh, physical. I think I forgot to breathe for about half the movie.
0887307280|5.0|I would recommend this book to any entreprenuer or business owners.It is a must tool in any business owner's tool box.<br />Briefly, Michael explains that how we run a business is a reflection of our internal self.<br />And he explains the cycle of a business from an infant to a mature state, much like a child to a grownup.<br />What this means is that it gives one an idea of what will be experience and he highlights the common pitfalls.<br />One of his statement that is my favorite is 'successful business owners continuously learn and grow. Unsuccessful owners are those defending what they know'.<br />Yet another one is ' are you working IN yr biz or are you working ON yr biz?'.

0385512104|5.0|I have a niece who has Asperger's. I read as much as I can to try to understand her way of relating to the world as she is a puzzle to me. This book was an absolute eye opener into the thinking and the behavior of a person with autism. While it is a novel written by one who has worked with autistic individuals, in my opinion, he captures the essence of the autistic mind very well. The world is very frightening to my niece and this book helps me to see why, as the main character so literally interprets his world around him and often is bombarded by the constant noises and smells. The book at times is humorous as his literal thinking can be quite funny, not to him, but to us \\"Normal Typicals\\". I found this book to be a delightful way to learn more about autism. I couldn't put the book down.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This album is Moby at his peak. By far his best and most energetic album. He had not produced anything better before that album and has not produced anything as good since. Actually his albums seem to be deteriorating since he produced this.
B000002GAF|5.0|I found this web site very easy and intuitive to use. I found the CD I was looking for in a few minutes. I received this brand new CD a few days later. The CD was in perfect condition.    I will re-use this site the next time I want to buy a CD.
B000003TA4|5.0|The Yay! in Smells Like Teen Spirit is sarcasm, sarcastically inserted after the singer peruses the itinerary of pop culture set before him. Overbored, self-assured women, a freak show of interracial sex and perversion, a diminished and belittled mosquito of a libido his inheritance, and a cowed generation forced to issue a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial (!) of the truth of it all.       This record is worth it for the one song alone.
0446698326|4.0|I did really enjoy the writing style of this book, however I found the ending... not what I would have wanted. For those of you who don't mind that kind of ending, you would really enjoy this book. It shows John's deep love for Savanna and I really appreciated that aspect of the book. It shows that love never dies, but what changing love can do to (and for) all of us.
B00000K3CR|5.0|It is fun to see everyone when they're young. A FUNNY movie from start to finish.
B00006I53S|4.0|I thought this lens would become my everyday, all-around lens, replacing the  standard 18-55 lens that came with my camera.  The 28-135 lens has a lot of zoom for the price and the image stabilizer means I can get crisper images on the run, but there are two drawbacks that keep me carrying the other lens around.  First, this lens is big and heavy.  In one sense this is good because it feels more solid and well-built than the 18-55 lens and I have a feeling it will last a lot longer.  However, it weighs about a s much as my XTi (if not more) so the balance is weird and the combination is bulky.  This is something that may just need getting used to, but right now I am less likely to just pull it out to take a quick snap.  The second issue is that I discovered how much I use the 18-28 range on the other lens.  18mm offers almost twice the viewing angle of 28mm, so whenever I want a wide view (either a panorama or when I am in an enclosed space) I go back to my old lens.  As I said this is a good lens, but you may want to keep (or get) another lens to complement it.
159562015X|5.0|I found it very informative and accurate with some creative ways to look at and use the findings of the survey included with the book.    I recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their skills, build a strong team, or even figure out what avenue of education or career to pursue.    It's also fun to talk about over cocktails with friends and colleagues.  The information and the book have become great networking and self marketing tools.
B0000542D2|4.0|I guess you would have to love this movie if you are a Beatles fan.  It really takes you back to a time when movies were very wholesome and fun.  The humor is a little goofy, but that whats makes it so enjoyable.  It is a great film that the whole family can enjoy.  Definately check this one out if you are looking for a very different film then what we have today.
0143038419|1.0|I'm sorry but I couldn't even get half way through this book.  I couldn't relate to the main character finding her selfish and spoiled.

B0000DD7LC|4.0|And I think this is probably the album to choose. I have listened to this CD over and over in the past. More than 25 times! =P<br /><br />Anyway, this is what I think of it, track by track.<br /><br />Intro - 7.5 Nice, but I think the intro, Piano & I on Songs In A Minor was better.<br />Karma - 7 Never cared too strongly for this track, and it's not the best way to start this off. However, it's OK. The worst track on the album.<br />Heartburn - 7.75 Has somewhat of an old-school R&B feel to it.<br />If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By - 8.5 Quite enjoyable actually. I don't know how much of it is Alicia's doing though since it's partially a remake.<br />You Don't Know My Name - 9.5 One of the best tracks on the CD! Leave it to Kanye to work his production magic. Loads of bass, but it fits. Love you, Kanye Omari!<br />If I Ain't Got You - 9 Decent video, but love the song. Great choice of a single. This was my ish for a while!<br />Diary - 10 It was very nice to hear this tune at night on 93.7 WBLK. Anyway, it's perfect. No flaws whatsoever. The second best track on the CD!<br />Dragon Days - 7.5 I can relate pretty much even though I'm a guy! =D Anyway, it's decent, but she offers better elsewhere. Also, there isn't enough piano.<br />Wake Up - 8.25 Nice lyrics, some meaning behind it. Pretty good overall.<br />So Simple - 8 Not as strong as Wake Up, but relate-able.<br />When You Really Love Someone - 8 She writes about relationships, and the needs that many people seek. Love her.<br />Feeling U, Feeling Me (Interlude) - 8 This is my mom's jam. She wishes so much for it to be a song. It makes for a great interlude.<br />Slow Down - 11 I feel this song immensely. Great message, especially for the ladies! I think it's her best song, period.<br />Samsonite Man - 8.5 Great piano. But what do you expect from Alicia? Pretty good lyrics. One of the better songs here.<br />Nobody Not Really - 9.5 A super-great song. Jazzy feel. Relate-able. Nice ending. Gives you a bit of insight; into her life, maybe even into your own. Super enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, it is a very good experience. Alicia brings you into her thoughts, her dreams, her life. Longing is what I hear in her spirit. You gotta check this one out if you've skipped over it.<br /><br />128 ÷ 15= 8.533333333<br /><br />4.25 stars.<br /><br />R&B with a touch of soul that shouldn't be missed!l, it is a very good experience.

B000002WU9|5.0|5/5    Picture an album with no filler, fifteen songs with sharp lyrics, top shelf production, and an all-star lineup of guest appearances and you are left with Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, an album that sent shockwaves through the East Coast rap scene and revolutionized the Mafioso subgenre.  Raekwon the Chef (a.k.a Lou Diamonds) and his sidekick Tony Starks (Ghostface Killer) create an instant rap classic laden with clever motifs, symbols, and wordplay.  The end result of their writings and ideas over RZA's sharp beats is music of such a high quality that it actually transcends the subject matter itself.  Guest appearances include fellow Wu-Tang members U-God, Inspectah Deck, GZA, RZA, Masta Killa, and Method Man.  Nas sets off Verbal Intercourse with a potent verse that sets the standard high for Raekwon and the Ghosftace Killer on the following verses.  Raekwon holds his own on Incarcerated Scarfaces, Knowledge God, and Spot Rusherz, the only songs in which he appears solo.    Only Built 4 Cuban Linx is the best of the classic Wu-Tang solo albums released during rap's golden era.  It is a flawless album that stands as a testament to hip hop's creative peak in the mid-90's.    Best Songs: Incarcerated Scarfaces, Guillotine [Swordz], Verbal Intercourse, Wu-Gambinos
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Why in the hell do so many feel compelled to rip on one or the other?  I saw Pink Floyd in Phoenix on their Division Bell Tour and then Waters in Vegas on his In the Flesh tour.  Both of them are geniuses.  Pure and simple.<br />Gilmour was recently voted \\"Best Guitarist of all time\\" by Guitar magazine, UK and desrves it.  No one has a feel for lead guitar melody like him.<br />Waters is superb on lyrics and really knows how to put music together [listen to him and Jeff Beck on Amused to Death].  It just doesn't get any better.  The fact that these two are no longer together does not mean one is a loser, or one is better, or any damn thing.  It just means we now have two different sources of listening pleasure.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a good way to start with the Beatles, Imagine, you have 27 number one hits on a single cd ! Who could ask for more ?  Of course, The Beatles have many great songs that were not number ones, but if you want only the number one, your search is over, buy this one !

0618680004|4.0|I went into this book as an agnostic leaning slightly toward the probability of a creator.  Despite Dawkin's insisting throughout the book that I would be an atheist by the last page, I remain an agnostic still, but decidedly closer to the 50/50 range.  Dawkins makes a number of interesting arguments in this book and points out a great deal of facts that many of us might not have already known.  The subject matter does stray a bit from the basic God/no God argument at times, but this is a good thing for a Scientist like Dawkins who is going over treaded ground.      Dawkins makes a huge mistake in trying to convey that we are at a level of science advancement that allows us to make solid assumptions on the probablity of a creator.  Despite a very strong argument using the basic tenets of evolutions as theorized by Darwin, the fact is that the numbers aren't all in on this issue yet.  Even Dawkins himself does admit that even he can't justify total disbelief in a God, but considering his evidence it really is impossible to go the other way too.  Dawkins does do a good job of debunking the entirety of fundamentalism as a joke.  He even takes a few good shots at world religion as a whole, proving once again that followers of Christianity and Islam are justifying an extremely improbable premise.    I still greatly enjoyed the book.  Besides the slight downfalls of Dawkin's Atheist argument, the other portions of the book are strong still.  It seems that many of these downfalls result from Dawkin's habit of setting up clever and attrictive metaphors to prove his points, which at the end of the day really aren't proven at all.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|The BBC's Planet Earth is a treat for the senses and a television milestone. The series was five years in the making with forty camaramen filming in two hundred locations. This is an exquisite view of our planet and its creatures.    The eleven episode series starts with From Pole To Pole. This episode acts as both introduction  to the series and as a sort of greatest hits disc as it follows the seasons and their effects around the globe. The ten episodes that follow take on the various habitats of the planet and their creatures: the mountains, fresh water, caves, deserts, ice worlds, great plains, jungles, the shallow sea, the seasonal forests and finally the deepest oceans.    Not only is the high definition picture spectacular so is the audio. The score by George Fenton is easily worth the price of the discs. If there is a downside to this set its that the Blu-ray discs do not include the supplemental material that is included in the lower priced standard definition edition. All in all about 250 minutes of footage has been excluded. It is hoped that this problem will be corrected in later editions.    As noted above the picture quality is spectacular and the series is well worth watching. I've noticed some reviews complaining of the David Attenborough narration but I feel that this original voiceover is the way to go. For years Attenborough has been the voice of the BBC's Natural History Unit and his voice adds much to the presentation.    The Blu-Ray set worked fine on my Sony Player. I did not encounter any of the problems faced by some who have purchased the HD version of the series. One would hope that this problem will soon be corrected as well. It should be noted that the menu selections are a little quirky but nothing that can't be dealt with.    Well worth the investment. Kudos to the BBC for bringing such a great series to its viewers. One can only ask where do they go from here?    Buy it.

B000Q66PXE|4.0|Season 1 of Rome is an enjoyable view into the lives of many different characters set circa 50 BC in the last years of Julius Caesar's reign. Primarily, the series focuses on the exploits of two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus -- played superbly by Kevin McKidd -- and Titus Pullo also portrayed superbly by Ray Stevenson.<br /><br />We watch through 12 season 1 episodes as Caesar rises to (and falls from) power over his mentor Pompey Magnus to create the all-powerful Rome. Marc Anthony is Caesar's right hand man. Cleopatra even makes an appearance.<br /><br />The series revolves around the exploits of two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus - played superbly by Kevin McKidd - and Titus Pullo also portrayed superbly by Ray Stevenson. The real fun of the show is watching Pullo and Vorenus battle violently in violent times and struggle with their own family values, loyalty to the Empire and friendship to each other.<br /><br />Season 2 of Rome is set circa 30 BC just after Julius Caesar's murder.<br /><br />In Season 2 Pullo and Vorenus become entwined with Mark Anthony and Octavian of the Julii, son of Atia (lover to Marc Anthony and others). Season 2 focuses on Octavian's rise to Emperor of Rome by political guile and bloody force.<br /><br />We watch through 10 Season 2 episodes as Octavian gains power over (his adversary at times--friend at times--stepfather figure at times) Marc Anthony. Cleopatra is also back and has a bigger role in Season 2.<br /><br />Both seasons are not always action-packed and move along a bit slowly at times, but overall they are so well done that--similar to other HBO series like The Sopranos--when they're good...they're really good.<br /><br />The price of this DVD series is perhaps HBO's way of saying, \\"You don't like it?...Subscribe to HBO!\\" So, you might consider renting unless you're a collector. Further, at the time of this writing, it's MUCH cheaper to buy the series releases individually.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000FJH4X2 Rome - The Complete First Season]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000PGTPH8 Rome - The Complete Second Season]]<br /><br />All hail HBO.]]    All hail HBO.

B000NDJOO2|5.0|A compeling story of the cost of war on young lives.  Not only those who died, but also those who survived.  The lives of the survivors were forever changed, often for the worse.
B000040OBS|5.0|Few bands that can be so scary as this one are so damn funny too at times (unintentional?). With super-repetitive, trance-inducing synth-lines backing the possessed echoing vocals, I don't know of anything like it. It feels like a euphoric nightmare at times, full of the menace and hooks. Good for late night head trips...
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Renee Zellweger always becomes the character.  She was joined by a fabulously casted ensemble of actors.  The story was good, and relatively faithful to Beatrix Potter's life.  The extras on the DVD were great, especially the biographical material on Potter, and the scenes from the lands she left in trust for the British people.

The story is all the more powerful, as all of the primary roles are played by great character actors, not big name stars.  You see all of those familiar faces, who are usually seen in supporting roles, but now have center stage, making the story much more real.

B000MCIBB6|5.0|Even though I read the reviews on this site beforehand, still I was surprised by the cleanness and clarity of the sound on this remixed CD.  The drumming jumps right out at you.  It is superb.  All guitar and keyboard sounds are easily audible and distinguishable, just as they should be.  Jim's voice - ahhh, you can hear every poetic scream, grunt, moan and croon.  So, you could say that I am totally satisfied with the sound.  And, totally convinced that this was one of few bands in which every member was supremely gifted.<br /><br />\\"Waiting For The Sun\\" happens to be one of my two favorite Doors albums, along with \\"Strange Days\\", and it's hard to talk about one without mentioning the other.  \\"Strange Days\\" lured us out of the Summer of Love with mystery, dark sensuality and hallucinatory suggestion;  and the last track, the epic \\"When The Music's Over\\", pointed the way to the next phase.  So then, \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" catapulted us without mercy into the chaotic hell that was 1968.  Many of the songs - chiefly \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\", \\"Unknown Soldier\\", \\"Five To One\\" and even \\"Spanish Caravan\\" - depict with violent or despairing lyrics and/or musical ferocity and dissonance a world going mad, which just about sums up 1968 and the years immediately following.  Of course, there are other, quieter themes too.  We revisit Venice Beach in \\"Hello, I Love you\\", and Pamela's house on \\"Love Street\\", both excellent tracks.  But things go downhill from there.  In \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\", the singer is uncertain \\"...where will we be when the summer's gone?\\"  The answer comes in \\"Wintertime Love\\", where it is so cold that only his love can keep him warm.  In \\"My Wild Love\\", his woman goes riding everywhere, only to encounter the devil and other hostile situations.  In \\"We Could Be So Good Together\\", the singer promises his love that he will tell her only \\"wicked lies\\".  And in the gentle \\"Yes, The River Knows\\", all we can look forward to is to \\"...breathe underwater till the end.\\"  Not much hope for the world in these songs.<br /><br />Now - the bonus tracks.  \\"Adagio in G Minor\\" sounds familiar to me, probably from old films.  It's not normal Doors material, but beautiful nonetheless.  What we get on the bonus \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" tracks are humorous studio chatter plus 2 alternate versions of the song.  The finished track is one of my favorites on the album, but these 2 alternates serve to give us a glimpse into the Doors' creative process, as well as showing how any deviation can change an overall finished track greatly.  The tracks are rather stripped down, almost like demos.  They are somewhat quieter than the \\"real\\" version, with Jim using different inflections on the vocals and sometimes almost whispering.<br /><br />And finally, we come to \\"Celebration Of The Lizard\\".  Like other reviewers, I wondered for years what this would be.  It clocks in at just over 17 minutes, and we hear Jim reciting his poetry of darkness and insanity over what seems to be improvised, or at least loosely planned, music.  And we are given yet another version of \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\", actually a major part of the work.  I doubt that I will want to listen to this long piece every time I hear the album, but still, it is interesting and for me a missing part of The Doors' repertoire, so I'm happy to have it.<br /><br />All in all, a masterful collection.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Ya gotta say it's brilliant.    From the novels by Jeff Lindsay to the Executive Producers who had the insight to bring this to the home screen. One of the most fantastic and unique series since Tony Soprano waded with his ducks and Adrian Monk contemplated a stray piece of litter.     This time around it's Michael C. Hall who brings us the seriously disturbed but insanely righteous character of Dexter Morgan. A far cry from his David Fisher role in \\"Six Feet Under\\" and ten times as complex. Superb casting. So to with the other regular cast members who fit so perfectly into the atmosphere of multi-cultural Miami and the interpersonal politics of daily survival..    Congratulations are in order for the season finale which does not resort to a cliffhanger. Sort of a happy ending with hints of luscious things to come.    Rent it. Buy it. Watch it.    You will get hooked.

B00005JODK|5.0|Most of us past a certain age remember the great musical comedies of yesteryear.  They were tuneful and amusing, and moviegoers would leave the theater with smiles on their faces.  For a brief moment, that era has returned with the opening of \\"Hairspray,\\" directed by Adam Shankman.  The story centers on pretty, plus-sized Tracy Turnblad, played with delightful &eacute;lan by the effervescent Nikki Blonsky.  Tracy, who lives in Baltimore in 1962, has an impossible dream.  She wants to dance on the Corny Collins show, a schlock American Bandstand clone.  Although Tracy has talent, she is not as photogenic as the plastic blondes and brunettes with hourglass figures who cavort across the stage on Corny's show.  There is also a subplot dealing with the shunting aside of African-Americans in the media and in American society as a whole. When Tracy is repeatedly sent to detention, she befriends a lively group of African-American teenagers who teach her some new moves and open her eyes to a world she scarcely knew existed.  Tracy eventually lends her support to a grass-roots movement to make the public aware that times are changing and integration is the wave of the future.<br /><br />Shankman handles his lively and energetic cast perfectly and the actors work together seamlessly.  John Travolta stands out in more ways than one.  He portrays Tracy's very large mother, Edna Turnblad, a shy laundress who has not left her home in years.  She is deeply ashamed of her appearance and she wants to keep Tracy from suffering as she has for so long.  Travolta inhabits the role completely; he is convincing and poignant, and he sings and dances up a storm.  Christopher Walken is Tracy's dad, Wilbur, an unassuming gag shop owner who wants his beloved only child to follow her dreams.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays a stock villainess, Velma Von Tussle, with appropriate nastiness, and Queen Latifah, as always, is saucy and sassy as the outspoken Motormouth Maybelle.  Allison Janney is a hoot in a cameo rule as Prudy Pingleton, a repressed religious fanatic who wants her daughter to stay away from hooligans (that includes almost everyone of her daughter's age).<br /><br />The movie looks good, it is well-paced and nicely edited, and the musical numbers are tuneful, expertly choreographed, and beautifully executed.  The underlying social message is delivered without subtlety, but it is effective nevertheless. \\"Hairspray\\" is about inclusion, the value of a loving and supportive family, and the importance of ethnic pride and self-acceptance.  It is hilarious and good-hearted entertainment and easily one of the most enjoyable films of the year.as Prudy Pingleton, a repressed religious fanatic who wants her daughter to stay away from hooligans (that includes almost everyone of her daughter's age).

B000MRAAJW|3.0|This is a well regarded, premium nature series with scenery so stunning (esp on HD) that at times it looks unreal.   That said, I found it no more impressive that other works by IMAX or the BBC, such as Wild South America.      Right or wrong, I expected a little more for $60.00, although part of my disappointment was the constant focus on a \\"survival of the fittest\\" theme, repeatedly showing animals being ripped apart by other animals, which I felt was an unnecessary distraction.        With that caveat in mind, Planet Earth is a worthwhile addition to any media collection, to be sure.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|This is the first and as far as im concerned the best of the Saw movies.  This movie is very original and the ways the writter has Jigsaw torture these people is cool and very disturbing.  Personally, I didn't see the twist at the end coming and was blown away, I think that is why this is my favorite of the Saw series.  Highly recommending, but be forewarned; it's demented.

B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|This title was as enjoyable at home as it was in the theater. Sadly I feel that the DVD version would have been just as good as the BluRay. In the era where high definition is king, the 300 BluRay failed to capitalize on that angle by maintaining the films grainy appearance. And although the grain is meant to portray atmosphere, it does not do a HD setup justice. The features were sorely lacking and I fear that this title will suffer from \\"DVDitis\\" in that multiple releases of this product will feature the \\"Unrated\\" and \\"Director's Cut\\" moniker that almost all the current DVD's are subjected to. The special features were sorely lacking, although the ones on the BluRay were good, I feel that they could have done a better job at including more being that the BluRay format has more potential in terms of storage. Rent before you buy, you might be glad you did.
0143036742|5.0|In this unusual novel set in the English countryside, Nadia narrates the story of her father, an 84-year old Ukrainian engineer who marries 36-year old Valentina, also a Ukrainian.  The old man is crazy in love with the busty blonde, while she only has eyes for English citizenship papers.  Nadia and her estranged sister Vera frantically try  to help their confused, lonely father get out of this marriage to his cruel and promiscuous bride, while he doggedly writes his magnum opus, a history of tractors, in Ukrainian.<br /><br />Valentina is a brutish cow of a woman who has men lining up for her attentions; she quickly makes Pappa's life unbearable.  Nadia, ten years younger than her sister, grew up knowing nothing of their parents' lives in Ukraine; little by little she gets Vera to talk about what her parents - and she - went through under Russian and German rule.  These reminiscences were so horrific, so pitiable, I read with tears in my eyes, yet I was glad to see light shed on this grim chapter of history.<br /><br />This is a quick read, an odd combination of wry family humor and grand tragedy; I would not call it a comedy by any means. Recommended for those who like stories about families whose members don't always see eye-to-eye, and for those who would like to learn about the Ukrainian experience in the 20th century.
0316018953|5.0|Why so much fuss about the book being 80 pages too short?  The last 5 or 6 Bosch books have been marred by overwriting, not to call it \\"padding.\\"  This one was just right.  Okay, so it's easy to guess the solution.  By now Connelly readers know exactly what we want--a case in which Harry has the entire LAPD breathing down his neck, and a case in which even his partners doubt him, and a case which will pit him against the brilliant, erratic FBI agent Rachel Walling, here meaner than ever, and yet Harry falls for her once again--you can imagine from their interactions that he's just one of those guys who the worse you treat him, the more he likes it.<br /><br />In THE OVERLOOK you get all these elements plus the fun of Harry breaking in a hew partner, Ignacio, who likes to be called \\"Iggy\\" but Harry thinks \\"Iggy\\" is too undignified a name for a police.  You keep hoping that Harry will unbend just once and call his partner \\"Iggy.\\"  But everytime, Harry lays down the hammer, and each time, it's satisfying.  Harry imparts lots of ancient cop wisdom to Ignacio, including the case in which an apparent suicide was proved a murder when detectives on the scene found the left hand palm print of a man above the toilet tank, proving he was right handed.  \\"How'd they know that?\\" Iggy asks, brows furled.  \\"Stands to reason a man taking a leak will hold his tool with his preferred hand,\\" Harry replies deadpan.<br /><br />I enjoyed it all the way through.  After the wonderful ECHO PARK of last year, THE OVERLOOK shows signs that after a few years of duds, Connelly is back with a vengeance, writing as well as ever.  Have you ever thought that Harry must have been the youngest American GI in Vietnam?  He must have been eleven by my reckoning, possibly ten.  Oh wait, the youngest must have been Joe Pike from the Elvis Cole novels.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I bought this in great anticipation as everything I've heard by Linkin Park up to this time has been strong. However, it was time for a change. Linkin Park had a sound that worked, but too many were trying to copy their sound and it was dragging LP down with em. They needed to seperate themselves from the masses once again.    Minutes to Midnight was quite an experiment for LP. The songs on this album range from hard rock to a much softer, almost acoustic sound. I personally love almost every song on this cd, but I find the overall album lacking. Reason being is there is too many different styles on one cd.    This disc seems like it should have been kept in the studio for a bit longer as LP decided on which direction they wanted to take. Any one of the songs would have made a good direction (IMO) but there is far too  much searching going on. I think Rick Rubin really pushed LP to reach beyond a style that was about to be worn out and find out what they were capable of. I just wished they had come to a conclusion before releasing the album. I am highly anticipating their next release!

I have not found any other book that even compares.<br /><br />It goes through how to write maintainable, readable code, with excellent descriptions of why to code that way.  Plus it is language agnostic (the book uses a couple of languages for illustration purposes, but you have to start somewhere).<br /><br />One side note: if you are doing function programming, pick up the first version of this book. This version was written for all of the object oriented languages out there.
B000QXDED6|5.0|the only thing missing is the inside insert that tells   the information  about the movie. -- if you could send me one to insert i would greatly appreciate it    thanks robert oswald
1594489505|5.0|I love this author and his second book is even better than his first. I didn't think anything could top the Kite Runner, but I was wrong. It is amazing to me how well he can write from a woman's perspective. All the details of this life are so amazing. I cannot wait to see what story he writes next.
B00009RDG9|4.0|Yes, we have seen this plotline before, but that didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying the movie. Tommy Lee is at his laconic best and Benicio definitely has the eyes of a cold blooded killer. The tracking and knife fighting scenes were as authentic as it gets, and the setting provided a beautiful backdrop to the cat and mouse hunt that takes up most of the movie. The action is relentless and exciting. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Rambo when it first came out. The highly skilled loner evading both a mob of law enforcement officers and a highly skilled tracker makes for a good viewing experience, especially in the hands of a world-class director like William Friedkin.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Nikki has bared his emotions.  Life is Beautiful is definatly the best song on the album! It is definatly worth buying.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This movie has been reviewed over 500 times now, so I won't write much. I'd like to ditto (i.e. concur with) the review by Michael J. Mazza.    The film is about as realistic in setting as one could make it. There are a few inconsistencies in the sailing, but only noticeable to an experienced sailor - they don't take away from the film anyway.     The film catches the right balance between focusing on the crew and its adventures and daily life, versus the Napoleonic Wars. In otherwords, no need to be a student of that period to understand or appreciate the movie.  There is no romance, which has probably hurt the film in terms of broad popularity; perhaps in the same sense of the movie \\"Tora Tora Tora !\\" from the 70s. It was one of the best war films ever made (subjective, I know:). Point is, both are 'limited' by lack of romance in their plots. The two share excellent settings and historical research.    I will point out that M&C distinctively shows the antecedents of 'modern' military leadership: the Capt must balance his personal ambitions with care for the crew, he must coach the young midshipmen (Hollom, Blakeney, Callamy, etc), and use a persuasion to get the sailing master and more experienced Officers and crew to follow him in dire situations. This sort of shows the development of \\"leadership principles\\" as used today.    Good movie all around. Crowe was GREAT !

B00001PE4D|4.0|The DVD includes scenes/dialogue that got edited in the airline/TV version that I saw previously.  Sarah Michelle Gellar (I keep thinking 'Buffy' whenever I see her...) looks great in every scene and there are a few chuckles, but for the most part, it's a relatively dark plot with a few surprises and a lot of heartache...
B000V39KDO|4.0|The effects are great; sometimes you could'nt tell real from annimated although the actors were all well above average. There were a few 'bloopers' even a novice could spot,it could not be written as hostorically correct,and this movie is a definate 'no'  for young children,but all in all- I thought it was great!
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|By far the greatest movie ever made.  Having the HD version doesn't make the picture look all that much better since it was shot in front of a greenscreen, but the all digital sound is extremely noticeable if you are using surround sound
B000S6LT42|5.0|Although it's not easy to summarize a brief review about such works (four DVDs, after a world tour...), I try, starting from the strong points.   In general, the quality of the film and the recording are excellent and the live atmosphere of the Stones' shows seems fully captured: apart from Mick Jagger's brilliant performances, Richards-Wood's duets (still the best R'N'R' \\"battery\\" in the world) are really nice and the two rhythm guitar lines delight listener's ears (with good headphones or a hi-fi set, you can hear even the pick \\"licks\\" on the guitar strings). For connoisseurs: maybe you will discover some little mistakes of the players into some tracks: the recording does not hide it (it's a live!)  and I appreciated this.  What's more, some highlights, like the concert at Copacabana beach, are really impressive: it is probably one of the best live concert released by the Stones, for quality of the sound and for the film shots (and for the great audience: 1,5 million persons).  The choice of the tracks is good, as it covers most of the setlists performed during the Bigger Bang Tour (for more information about them, see specialized websites, like \\"[...]\\"). For those who were present at the live concerts, it should be nice to find again most of the songs played there.   Some little weak points, now, especially about the documentary parts. After two years of live concerts all around the world, this could be the occasion to give more space to some rarities about technical and personal details (tour rehearsals, backstage, personal training of the musicians, etc.): under this point of view, the preceding box \\"Four Flicks\\" (Live Licks tour) seems more complete (the first DVD shows the \\"countdown\\" of the days before the tour and the technical preparation of stage, lights, setlists, etc.). However, the Biggest Bang box contains some relevant chapters, like the preparation of Rio's gig, or the setting up of the Super Bowl show, and some gems (listen to the improvised version of \\"I can't be satisfied\\", played during the rehearsals of the Italian concert in Milan), really enjoyable for fans.  Comparing to such set, the price seems to be reasonable, cheaper than the preceding \\"Four Flicks\\" box, when released.
B000002OYB|5.0|Welcome to the Neighborhood sounds more like Bat Out of Hell than Bat Out of Hell II or III. This is simply a great album. Give it one listen and you'll be hooked on nearly every song. I don't think I've ever felt that way about any other album before. It usually takes repeated listens to fall in love with an album's lesser-known cuts. Not this time. This is vintage Meat Loaf. If you haven't bought Bat Out of Hell III yet, do yourself a favor and skip it... and buy Welcome to the Neighborhood instead.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I and my entire family were watching the collection on my 32\\" Flatscreen. Despite the fact that its not Blu-ray, it was the best shooting i have ever seen.

Consequently i got caught by the images so i ordered it the next moment. Super film.
B000LC55F2|4.0|the prestige is a magic treat, a love for magic so deep they sacrifice everything and anything to be the best. this is a keeper, the cast is great, the acting, the story, very suprising in the end. to win it all you have to lose it all. the cast alone you knew you were in for a treat. hugh jackman is one of the best actors out there. so down to earth, but has the hero thing about him. i love all of his movies and in this film his gift is clearly seen. christian bale is wonderful. he has a load of good movies under his belt as well. his acting speaks for itself, and his accent is nice. scarlett johanssen played her part very well. these men are trying to outdo each other ever since a tragic accident. niether wants to loose and that becomes their obsession. nothing else around them matters. and in the end only the best will triumph. sad at times. all it was said to be and more theres so much beauty and talent throughout the whole movie you just want to watch it again and again. i hugely applaud it.
0142000663|4.0|Detractors of this novel will tell you that The Grapes of Wrath is melodramatic, contrived, and relentlessly preachy - and I can't argue with them.  The Grapes of Wrath is overwrought and about as subtle as a hand grenade, but it is also a powerfully affecting novel.  I challenge even the most cynical reader not to be moved (at least a little) by the tragic story of the Joad family.<br /><br />The novel is often described as a `sweeping epic' (which means it is longer than the average book).  It is undeniably a classic and well worth reading, but is not without its flaws.  The novel is compelling and I found myself having trouble putting it down as I neared the final chapters, however it does get bogged down in spots and some of the dialogue is repetitive.  Steinbeck is unquestionably one of the most important writers of the 20th century, but (and let's be honest here) his prose is largely unremarkable (certainly when compared to Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\").<br /><br />And then there are the politics...<br /><br />Personally, I don't have a problem with an author having a strong point of view and expressing it in a novel.  Yes, Steinbeck portrays a complex issue as if it were clear-cut.  He portrays the migrants as good and noble (the men-folk may behave badly at times; drinkin', brawlin', and womanizin' but they are inherently good).  Meanwhile, the banks and the land owners are evil personified.  There is no middle ground in The Grapes of Wrath.<br /><br />Despite what some reviewers would have you believe, The Grapes of Wrath is not a communist manifesto.  It does however, question how a country so plentiful can allow so many to starve and suffer and Steinbeck doesn't hesitate to point his finger at those he feels are to blame.  Reality is considerably more complex. The plight of the dustbowl farmers was inevitable as the economy changed and small family farms became unsustainable.<br /><br />Steinbeck's narrative alternates between the Joad family's story (the even numbered chapters), and a series of expository chapters (the odd numbered chapters) that provide a broader perspective of the migrant experience.  These expository chapters are the most politically charged and blatantly biased of the novel, but they also feature some of the best writing.<br /><br />My review sounds mixed because I have mixed feelings about the novel.  It is bold, but contrived, compelling, yet melodramatic, powerful, but preachy.  All in all though its strengths outweigh its shortcomings.  The Grapes of Wrath is well worth reading, just don't set your expectations too high.  This isn't one of the best novels ever written, in fact, it isn't even Steinbeck's best.a series of expository chapters (the odd numbered chapters) that provide a broader perspective of the migrant experience.

0792833201|4.0|poltergeist, a very good movie. it's hard to make movies like this nowadays, so when it happens it's good to hear, but here's a movie that's old skool horror. a battle between good and evil. an innocent family on unholy ground. a little girl lured in by evil, parents must fight to get her back. this film has been around for a very long time and it's still scaring strong.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|David Lynch's latest film comprises several different but related \\"realities.\\" Those who say it's just a jumble of random scenes aren't paying attention. The numerous visual rhymes (for instance: a man with a huge ketchup stain on his belly in one scene, a woman dripping blood from her screwdriver-impaled stomach in another) and lines repeated by different characters in different contexts, like verbal leitmotifs, make up a complex web of interrelated, fractured narratives. Some say it's like a cubist painting, but it's more like a hypercube. Inland Empire is a mutlidimensional, trans-temporal maze, bewildering but endlessly intriguing.     As usual with Lynch, dream logic dominates. But if Eraserhead is like one prolonged nightmare, Inland Empire is like an entire night of interconnected dreams condensed into three hours. There's nothing here that's as thrilling and strangely moving as the Club Silencio scene in Mulholland Drive, but overall I think I like Inland Empire a bit better. It's much more complex and even more amenable to multiple viewings, although I doubt the film will ever quite reveal itself as a surprisingly understandable story the way Mulholland Drive does. Inland Empire is audacious, crazy and daring. Unfortunately, a lot of people, including a lot of Lynch fans, resent the film for it. But to me it adds up to a remarkable, truly innovative achievment.    The extras are excellent, especially the half hour of behind-the-scenes clips, and the 75-minute \\"Other Things that Happened,\\" a collection of deleted scenes edited together to form a separate movie that functions as an addendum to the main feature.
B0009A40ES|4.0|this movie gave me the creeps.  goes to show you can't judge a book by it's cover. bale is brilliant in this movie. he knows how to get into character, and he can only stay under control for so long. killing is his high. and it just shows you never really know someone.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Indulging, entertaining and highly tragic. Very rewarding for the individual who enjoys a taste of history combined with the remarkable blends of fantasy.

079284131X|4.0|dolls are suppose to be your friends, the ones that make you feel better, and those that sleep with you throught the night...until now!! this movie is good enough to give anybody a scare. you'll never look at another doll the same again. this is the movie that terrified kids of their once loved dolls, and made adults look twice as they passed their childrens dolls by. the reason kids started to hide them in the closet, no longer want to play, the movie that made childs best friend a real life fear. a doll is possessed with the spirit of a seriel killer and has only a short time before he is trapped in that little body forever. he becomes this little boys christmas gift, and slowly befriends him, then people start dying, and things start taking a turn for the worst. there's no stopping this little guy, or is there. the story is good, the actors do a good job, the kid hits it right on the dot. when it's over you'll still be thinking about it.
B000002JSJ|4.0|the two bookends to this album, \\"achilles last stand\\" and \\"tea for one,\\" are outstanding, and could fit in somewhere on physical graffiti without diminishing that great albums worth. also, smack dab in the middle here, there's \\"nobody's fault but mine:\\" another fine song with a killer hook that could go on the graffiti album nicely. those three tracks alone clock in at something just over 26 minutes. so there's lots of good music on this thing. lots of tension in the sound, a powerful rhythmic drive throughout, and slightly quirky melodies wound-up tight. nice inventive guitar work from jimmy page, and john bonham's drumming is often as gonzo as that of keith moon's fiercest frenzied attacks on the skins. the other four tracks sandwiched in here (for your life/royal orleans/candy store rock/hots on for nowhere) are good enough, all zepplin fans should have 'em, but they are simply not quite up to par with the bands classic work. if you are a young thing and looking to get into zepplin, i would say start with their first album and just keep going. work your way up to this album. eventually you will want it, but their first 6 albums are better overall. if you are already familiar with zepplin's classic albums, and somehow missed this lesser known one, don't shy away from it. plenty of good stuff here.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|scarface is one of my very favorites. this movie is very powerful, beautifully done, and one of the most influential of all time. no matter how many movies al pacino does, he will always be known as tony montana aka scarface no matter what. this role was made for him, he was born for this. the rise and fall of this man, the love he won and lost, the power he earned and abused, the drugs he bought, sold, did, and that destroyed him. at the end he went out like a real man, taking a lot of fools with him. he went down like a soldier, but they killed him from the back like cowards. this was the life for him, the life he dreamed of, the life he achieved, but in the end it caught up to him. it always does. it got to him. the life and everything that came with it. for a brief moment the world was his. a guaranteed pleaser. no doubt.
0783114893|5.0|I have this movie on DVD, and went to see the remake in the theaters.  This is FAR better.  Sean Bean did a good job of playing \\"The Hitcher\\" in the new version, but his acting skill doesn't quite match the effect or the spookiness that Rutger Hauer can do!  Rutger Hauer is so believeable in this role!  He makes this movie what it is!<br /><br />Rutger Hauer was picked up on the ROAD.......hence the name \\"The Hitcher.\\"  You're not a \\"hitcher\\" if you give a guy a ride who's hanging out in a convenience store....as Sean Bean was doing.  Bean never stuck out his thumb.<br /><br />The new version had changed the storyline a little, with Sophia Bush saving the day.  The 1986 version is the true thriller!
B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|Great service and shipping by amazon...movie couldn't have been worse. I expected historical inaccuracy, and got it. The dialogue, on the other hand, was so suprisingly horrid that it made the movie almost unwatchable. I will give it this, it wasn't quite as bad as Battlefield Earth.

B000002G7G|5.0|Why most people in the world have not heard the melancholy sounds of the Velvet Undergroud's self titled album is a mystery to me.  Credited as the first punk-rock band, the Velvet Underground is one of the few bands that were willing to be avant-garde by mixing music with every other thing provocative, sweet and sad.  The song Pale Blue Eyes, in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful, depressing and well crafted poems ever written.  The twentieth-century author by the name of James Joyce once wrote that beauty consisted of three things: wholeness, harmony and radiance.  The Velvet Underground's self titled album defines beauty.
0930289234|4.0|I am happy with my purchase.  I got it quickly and in great condition
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I heard them play on Leno and thought they sounded a lot like Damien Rice.  I found the soundtrack and loved all the clips so I bought it even before I saw the movie.  The music is so melodic and haunting and listening to it with the images of the movie now in my head make it that much better.  This has been in my CD player constantly and on my MP3 player and if I only listen to a little music on any day, this is it.  It is beautiful, relaxing and the best CD you'll buy this year.
B00005MP58|5.0|WOW! This is a great movie! Colin Firth does a dynamite job of playing Mr. Darcy. I also like how \\"Kitty\\" avoids \\"Mr. Collins\\" in the later part of the movie. \\"Mrs. Bennent\\" does a beautiful job of being melodramatic. This is an excellent movie to watch!
0807014273|5.0|Frankl believed that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose - that neurosis is caused by \\"frustration in the will to meaning\\". Frankl's belief in meaning was formulated in the horror of a Nazi concentration camp. His essential optimism comes through in the following: \\"It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future...and this is his salvation in the most difficult moments of his existence, although he sometimes has to force his mind to the task...the [Auschwitz] prisoner who had lost faith in...his future was doomed.  With his loss of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold; he let himself decline and become subject to mental and physical decay...he simply gave up...lying in his own excreta, and nothing bothered him any more\\".<br />My own book \\"The Optimistic Jew: a Positive Vision for the Jewish People in the 21st Century\\" ([...]) is an attempt to encourage the collective mind of the Jewish people to once again believe in its own future (and stop wallowing in its past) lest we end up lying in our own historical excreta with nothing bothering us anymore.
0767020308|4.0|I love this movie because it highlights the relationship between \\"Emma\\" and \\"Mr. Knightley.\\" The actor and actress did a good job of portraying their characters.
0345308239|5.0|Chapter One of this book is entitled \\"Pursuit of Policy Contrary to Self-Interest\\".  Here Ms. Tuchman identifies what she feels are the three criteria for folly: 1) it must have been perceived as counter-productive in its own time (not in hindsight); 2) a feasible alternative course of action must have been available; and 3) the policy in question should be that of a group (of rulers or entire societies) and not of single individuals.<br />In my book \\"The Optimistic Jew\\" I identify Israel's misconceived settlement policy in the occupied territories since the Six Day War as the most self-damaging project in the history of Zionism.  It is Israel's (and Jewry's) very own \\"March of Folly\\" and satisfies all of Tuchman's criteria.
B000244FDW|5.0|This is excellent! Beautiful singing from Elizabeth. I love how Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Bingley are portrayed in the movie. It's a good movie to watch!
1582701709|1.0|It's a good thing I got this from the library, because I was very disappointed.  I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't a re-write of Norman Vincent Peale's book \\"Power of Positive Thinking\\".  If you want to read something that REALLY works, read Peale's book, not \\"The Secret\\".  Very disappointing.
B000MV8AE0|1.0|MOST DISSAPOINTED IN THIS STORY. Acting just adequate, photography fair, but story poor, poor. I wish I rented this dvd and not waiste good money on having it collect dust on my shelf.    POOR, POOR Story.    Beethoven lived a most unuseual life and the facts alone to the novice could be absolutly facinating!
B00005JPLW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie in the theater and when it became available I had to add it to my DVD library.  I love the actors, especially Gerard Butler who played his role to perfection.  As a woman I enjoyed the sight of all of those men half clad and looks so fantastic.  Old or young we all appreciate the male figure in its perfection.<br /><br />I saw the real history of this event on one of the TV channels that deal with the reality vs. the movie events.  I like my history served up with lots of interesting sights and sounds.  Today young people are missing out when some of them can't find the U.S. of A. on a world map.  More the pity, but as the old addage goes, those who won't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.<br /><br />Buy the DVD and you will find it a treasure to pass along to the generations that are coming up who don't now appreciate our history and the implication it has on our own world and our future.
B000QXDED6|3.0|The movie itself was well done - good acting and cinematography, etc.  There were a lot of inaccuracies that were hard to ignore, such as the 8 ft tall Xerxes that looked more Egyptian than Persian, King Leonidas having a Sean Connery accent, the Persians paying off the Spartan Legislator, and the obviously fake creatures fighting for the Persians.    If you can separate the movie from reality you will enjoy it, just don't expect an accurate representation of the battle.
0743298020|2.0|Let me preface this by saying:  I love books and read books from all genres--so this isn't just a matter of me disliking a book because it's lengthy.  I saw reviews for this book and couldn't wait to read it.  I don't understand how this has so many 5-star reviews.  The story as it begins to unfold is so interesting.  An elderly reclusive author who has rejected numerous biographers writes a letter requesting an antique bookstore owners daughter to come stay with her and write her memoir.  There is mystery drenched on mystery here and I turned pages as quickly as I could until I was so mired in mystery that it all seemed pointless.  And then when I finally did reach the end (of both storylines) it was so hideously boring I couldn't believe I had wasted so much time!  The author seems to have come up with a great premise and possibly with some editing it could have been saved but instead we have a mess of a climax where everything is revealed and I was left scratching my head saying \\"SO WHAT?!\\"  Maybe having thoroughly enjoyed Stephen King, Alice Hoffman and Alexander Mccall Smith...I've grown accustomed to good storytelling.  And that's what is lacking in this book.  The premise was excellent.  And I can't complain about a lack of writing expertise by the author.  The one failing seems to be in the actual storytelling...2 people can tell the same joke--they have the same story just worded and delivered in completely different styles with the result being one will get a laugh and one will be met with silence as the listener figured out the joke 10 minutes before the speaker finished telling it.  That is my problem with this book.  If you're looking to waste a bit of your life and want to read a \\"bestseller\\"...I guess I can't stop you...but please browse furthe and find something more worthy.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Movie is excellent, packed with action and loved the fight scenes. I got to watch a scene or two on regular DVD and I can say definatly go HD.

B000MZHW40|4.0|Just as \\"Missing\\" captured the horror of the Chilean coup of the 1970's and \\"Salvador\\" the 1980's civil war in \\"El Salvador\\" in the 1980's, \\"Blood Diamond\\" reflects the terror of so-called rebels in Sierra Leone and Liberia in the 1990's.    Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant as a Rhodesian mercenary caught up in the diamond trade that kept the rebels armed and fighting, with the connivance of the international diamond industry. The film depicts how the rebels kidnapped boys and brainwashed them into soldiers willing to slaughter innocents. What it doesn't show is how girls were also taken, to serve as sex slaves and help bind the boys to their enslavers.    The guerrillas and terrorists of today have obviously not read Che or Regis Debray. The film shows how they could just drive into a village, killing everyone in sight, except those who they kidnapped as slaves and canon fodder. Che wrote that the purpose of guerrilla warfare is to win the hearts of the population. This isn't done by widescale slaughter, and is probably one reason why the rebels in Sierra Leone and Liberia lost their wars.
0385338694|4.0|I read this book for a light read and was not disappointed.  Had a few chuckles along the way which I appreciated.
B000007U6V|5.0|I love this album so much I actually stole my sister's copy when I was very young way before I even knew anything about music. And It's still brilliant. One thing I love about these guys is that every time there's an advance in music technology they remix all of their biggest hits to update them, it's just brilliant. I only hope that when I'm in my 50's I will still be making fresh and exciting music and be RELEVANT. Like Madonna lol.
1400062756|5.0|Awareness alone of the concept of a fixed mindset Vs growth mindset can be enough to make a significant impact on people's lives. Some people have criticized the book for being too repetitive / lengthy but that's like complaining that you had to dig through some mud to find a diamond. Who cares - her book has the power to enrich people's lives and she should be given great credit for writing this book. I highly recommend this book.
B00003CXA6|3.0|\\"Gettysburg\\" is an epic recreation of this pivotal battle of the US Civil War.<br /><br />It combines huge battle scenes with intimate conversations among the famous personalities including Lee, Pickett, Armistead, Longstreet on the Confederate side, and Hancock and Chamberlain on the Federal side.<br /><br />Standout performance are Tom Berenger as the cautious Longstreet and Martin Sheen as the legendary Robert E. Lee.<br /><br />At over four hours in length \\"Gettysburg\\" will test the patience of many viewers. It has feel of a mini-series and would be ideal to spread over two nights rather than watching it in one go. The characters indulge in a little too much speechifying and some of the battle scenes - staged using Civil War reenactors - seem a bit tame - but overall this is a well-made film.<br /><br />(****) for Civil War buffs and (***) for everybody else.
B00014NE62|5.0|HOW DOES ONE EXPRESS ONES SEXUAL ORIENTATION IN A CULTURE AND CLASS THAT SIMPLY WON'T BEAR IT???<br /><br />MAURICE has long been one of my favorite movies . I have seen it so many times, but on this last viewing I was struck with something that had never occurred  to me before: I have for years worked among the VERY wealthy high society \\"blue bloods\\" in which many of the men I know marry because it is the socially acceptable thing to do, denying their own sexual orientation.Often these men live secret lives and are completely miserable for fear of social ostracizing and disinheritance! MAURICE may be an  Edwardian English Period Piece to some, but trust me, the same old stuff keeps going on and on in America as I write.Ben Kingsley as The Doctor states, \\" The English have never been inclined to accept human nature.\\"  The story of MAURICE is timeless,especially for cultures that are inclined to be of English heritage.<br /><br />MAURICE (pronounced MORRIS) ,IMO, is the finest Merchant Ivory film ever done.The story line and acting is rock solid.;the tension and struggle is palpable;the costumes and cinematography are impeccable;and the revelations about the \\"upper-crust\\" are insightful and true.James Wilby, Rupert Graves and Hugh Grant are heartbreakingly convincing as the three principles in this human drama of sexual and class struggle.<br /><br />Excellent companion films would be ANOTHER COUNTRY,WILDE,BREAKING THE CODE and LOST LANGUAGE OF THE CRANES.
0061122416|2.0|This book was highly recommended by a couple of friends and I had high expectations, especially with the teasers on the covers of the book. I was open to being inspired and I was just really not into it. Elixirs and legends are not my cup of tea. I think the overall idea was nice, but, I couldn't relate to it. I found myself skipping whole sections and skimming towards the end. At times I was able to understand and empathize with Santiago, however, I lost his mission towards the end. I almost got a sci-fi, Harry Potter & Narnia vibe from this book. Note I don't like any of those!
B000O1799U|2.0|Sorry to report this, but this movie,which was one of the most over-hyped films in recent memory,was so far below the original Broadway production that it is a shame to mention it in the same breath.Now mind you, I saw the stage play twice hoping that each time I might like it better, but that did not happen. The original show has very little plot as you bounce from one song to the next. The film, on the other hand, adds so much unnecessary extra material that the film gets really draggy.The new songs added do nothing to push any plot forward, and apart from \\"I am Tellin' You\\" this show is a one hit wonder!Apart from that, this film or the show has little to recommend to anyone except those who want to hear screeching with unintelligible words!This film is all splash and no substance.     One note of praise: I thought that Eddie Murphy did a magnificent job with his role (and I do not personally care for him as a person,comedian or actor).    Hudson getting a Globe and an Oscar was ludicrous.
B000QXDED6|3.0|I waited until 300 came out on DVD to view it.  The battle sequences are pretty good, but it is an average movie, overall.  I didn't care for the way it was photographed.  It has a strange color palette.
B00005J6T1|5.0|Controversial as she may be sometimes, the longevity of Madonna's musical career would not be possible if she was incapable of making truly great music, and she really got off to a flying start with her debut album, which can hardly be contested as one of the greatest albums ever. This album spawned the signature essentials \\"Borderline\\", \\"Holiday\\", and \\"Lucky Star\\", and should you ever get tired of listening to any of them, turn to the super-catchy nonhit \\"Think Of Me.\\" Though she had a handful of sizable hits in the 90s & 2000s, Madonna is an 80s artist more than anything else, and her output from that decade should always be considered her best work.

B000N3ST8O|5.0|Mixing material from her Fleetwood Mac salad days with highlights from her successful solo career, Stevie Nicks has a nifty collection on her hands with \\"Crystal Visions.\\"<br /><br />Far better than past compilations like \\"Timespace, there are few complains to be made about \\"Crystal Visions.\\" It would have been nice to see Fleetwood Mac's gorgeous Top 10 classic \\"Sara\\" included, not to mention the Top 40 gem \\"All the Glitter Fades.\\" Also, the Deep Dish remix of the willowy, graceful classic rock radio gem \\"Dreams\\" from Mac's classic \\"Rumours\\" LP does not do the song justice, whereas Tracy Young jaw-droppingly brilliant remix of \\"Planets of the Universe\\" that reached #1 in the clubs in 2001 would have been a far more interesting choice than the album version. Nevertheless, at nearly 80 minutes in length, it is hard to find any real fault with this collection.<br /><br />Track after track, Nicks reminds that she has set a very high standard in rock that few have rivaled. Recent live recordings of Mac classics like \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Landslide\\" are passionate and full of depth, and the same goes for an extended length rendition of the \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" done with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in 2006. Both the live version and the original bookend the disc.<br /><br />The hits sound fresh as ever, owing to Nicks' longevity. \\"Silver Springs\\" still shimmers and sparkles with melodic craftmanship and lyrical intensity, and 80's hits like \\"Stand Back\\" and \\"I Can't Wait\\" make for jubilant fun. Smash duets with Tom Petty (\\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\\") and Don Henley \\"Leather and Lace\\") further enhance the collection. She even does as a live take on Led Zeppelin's \\"Rock and Roll.\\"<br /><br />In addition, the CD/DVD edition is worth the extra money to the more devoted fans. An assortment of videos are including, all with intriguing commentary from the woman herself. Documentary footage from the recording sessions for her solo debut \\"Bella Donna\\" is also an engaging treat.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|The picture is good. Because its what is about.(the cd case cover)  And in the movie, its great. because the screenplay and everything else is good. So, I give a 5 star.

0375505091|1.0|This book is perfect for today's society and culture.    Page after page I couldn't help thinking that Ms. Liebowitz was getting back at everyone because God made her so unattractive. It seems it runs in the family -- the photo of her sisters would frighten a scarecrow. Her parents look like fools, the photos of Sontag are disrespectful, and even Brad Pitt is at his worst. Ugly, ugly, ugly...    Yes the world is cruel and not everyone nor everything can be beautiful... it is merely that this book is blatantly defensive.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Everytime you watch this movie, it will motivate you to get off your azz and exercise. The reduction in sloth is worth the price of admission on this one. Let alone the fact that the movie isnt bad either. THe DVD is not as good as seeing it at the movie theater though. Hopefully, this is not your first time watching it. If so, watch it via projector and large screen. I think that I will go do some sit ups now......

The arguments presented make easy reading and are interspersed with plenty of humorous quotes, anecdotes, philosophical pearls of wisdom (and of folly) and provide for many laugh out loud moments - not least among which are the extreme religious views of some of the `moderate' modern day American religious community - Whoa!    If you're open-minded, reasonable and objective then you'd probably like this book, but it's not a book you can draw a conclusion from and then try to moralize to others - you really do have to read it for yourself.

From back of box: \\"Orca whales break the boundary between sea and air with explosive fury as they pursue their prey. In the ancient forests, the haunting cry of the spotted owl penetrates the stillness of its deep-green, shadowy world. On coastal estuaries, hundreds of thousands of shorebirds shimmer in the afternoon sun, and suddenly take flight in an aerial ballet. Five years in the making, Wild Northwest gives a rare insight into what remains of our vanishing natural landscapes and wildlife habitats. Original music and natural sounds combine with stunning visuals of the Pacific Northwest's wild dominions in this non-narrative film.\\"

1932907009|3.0|If you want to know how to direct good movies would you read a book by Michael Bay or Steven Spielberg? Mr. Spielberg, I think. So if you want to know how to write good screenplays do you read a book from the guy who wrote \\"Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot\\" and \\"Blank Check\\"? I did and I'm sorry for it. He basicly dishes out advice and then sort of contradicts himself. For example, he says all main characters should be introduced or hinted at within the first ten pages(minutes). Then he uses \\"Star Wars\\" as an example as a good movie that does things right. I agree. I it's my favorite movie. But aren't Luke Skywalker and Han Solo introduced after the first ten minutes? It's a lot of things like that. So why should anybody listen to him? Don't buy this book.

0446677450|5.0|Well with over two thousand I just didn't think there were enough opinions out there yet, so...<br /><br />Seriously, I got a few bits of information out of this book that made the time spent  worth it and thus the five star rating.<br /><br />This is not a nuts and bolts book on real estate or investing, etc.<br /><br />The personal story side, the anecdotal tidbits, and the fact that he teamed up with a good solid writer makes this book easy, fast and fun to read.  It's motivational and inspiring.<br /><br />As to the next step, there are plenty of works out there to learn the nuts and bolts.  I was struck by the connectedness I felt when reading this books list of assets one should attempt to acquire because under the list was a business that didn't have a requirement of having you the owner be there 24/7 (otherwise it's just a job).  This is the same advice given in the Four Hour Work Week, get a business up and running that can be on some sort of autopilot.  The point is that unless you're generating income outside of a 9 to 5, your just a wage slave, and really, even at a high hourly rate, this is no way to get wealthy or be prosperous.<br /><br />I read this book in a few hours one night.  It's highly recommended by me unless you're already one of those people that can leave for a month long vacation without worry about finances...

B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie is sick.  Since I have purchased it, I have watched it about 7 times and still get the chills at the visually amazing scenes.  This DVD is worth the extra money for the extra features as well.  You see a lot more about 300 then you originally thought.  Great value!

B000QQFKYE|5.0|I've watched INLAND EMPIRE only once.  I don't know what to say about it other than it seems to go on forever, its puzzle-like \\"plot\\" makes little sense (the first time around, at least), and it's very strange even by Lynch's robust standards of strange.  However, like all of Lynch's movies you have to take a leap of faith, surrender yourself to the film and just enjoy the imagery and the atmosphere and the randomness of everything.  Once you finish it, the film will leave a seed inside your mind, that will begin to grow and grow as you try to unravel the mystery of what you watched.  Repeated viewings will either confirm what is sprouting in your mind or will lead to new seeds planted.  Aside from all that, the film looks great - the HD is beautiful and no one films LA at night better than Lynch.  The cast is great, particularly Laura Dern.  If you're a Lynch fan, this is definitely a film for the DVD collection.  Stay tuned for review updates once I watch this film again and again and again....
0316010669|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much! So many examples of \\"blink\\" moments are included, from music to art to law enforcement, to military, etc. Great reading!
B00005NNMK|5.0|Having owned this tape in the early nineties, I used to sing along Karaoke to every one of these songs. It was back to the old swinging times again. This was one of their best albums and I remember next one \\"Wings of tomorrow\\" a dissappointment.<br /><br />A lot of quality guitarwork with great vocals, I would qualify this as crossover metal - right in between good old classic rock and metal. Kindof like pushing the boundaries of classic rock, like the Aerosmith's and the Rush'es of classic rock.
0684857219|5.0|Great book for learning and improving bodybuilding. The start of the book is the Bio of bodybuilding, I only browsed that section. The rest of the book is  educational and requires contemplation. Each person is unique and training methods and routines differ for each person. The book is a great guideline for learning and developing your own personal training routines.
0143038419|5.0|This book was a total joy! Liz Gilbert writes with honesty, insight and humor. I gave it as a gift to a friend who was embarking on a year of traveling the world, and she couldn't say enough about how wonderful it was. A great read for anyone!
0736063684|5.0|This book gives all the info you need to learn how to correctly weightlift or bodybuild. Showing the muscle structure and types of movements that affect that particular muscle is great for those that are learning, for those that that need to make sure that correct form is used. And best of all the pages in each section that covers injuries, How to avoid them and how to tell if you might have been injured by symptom reference. Great book for those learning and those not yet perfect.

1594489505|5.0|It's hard to believe that Hosseini could write another absolutely fabulous book, but he did. Make sure you have Kleenex available toward the end of the book. The relationship between Mariam and Laila is incredible and so beautiful. One wave after another of horrible leadership assaults Afghanistan and with the Taliban regaining strength right now, ones heart has to go out to the women there. Both of Hosseinsi's books are amongst my very favorites.

0192838679|2.0|I purchased the Oxford Classic edition of Les Liasons, translated by Douglas Parmee, and much to my chagrin, found the text to be riddled with poor writing and literary anachronisms.      Parmee may be accurately transliterating the French original; I of course cannot read it.  But the book he has produced borders on the unreadable.  Cecile, an aristocratic French girl of 15, speaks like a besotted 60-year old English gentleman.  \\"Fortunately Mummy's feeling much better today and Madame de Marteuil is coming with the Chevalier Danceny and somebody else but she never comes until late and when you're all alone for such a long time, it gets jolly boring.\\"  (pg. 32)  Yes, you read that right, \\"jolly boring.\\"  In Parmee's translation, Cecile uses \\"jolly\\" quite often, but somehow I cannot imagine a beautiful if naive French girl ever saying \\"jolly\\" anything.    Also gone is the tense sophistication of the Vicomte and the Marquise's dialogs in the movie--in its stead it seems that Parmee has elected to give them the voices of two American High School students, void of all intelligence, charm and wit, leaving them with just enough arrogant cunning to move the plot.  Throughout all the letters, there are a great deal of run-on sentences which require a great deal of effort to understand, a characteristic of bad writing.    I've read a few pages of the Lièvre translation and can plainly see that it is much improved.  I recommend you purchase that version and leave this one well alone, as I plan to do.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Love this first season!  I was not a fan of the TV show at first.  Now I am a fan!  Begin with season 1 and keep on buying the rest.  I also enjoy rewatching the series episodes.
0316067598|5.0|This book should be a must read for every high school student in the country. It tells about the goodness and dedication of these young men and women who give it all for their country. These men were true heros in every sense of the word and this book puts it out there. Action packed, filled with emotion and the true love that fighting men have for their brothers in arms. What is amazing is that the combat described is real and not some made up idiotic fantasy tale by hollywood types who have never experienced combat.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|the best masterization.  sounds great, the bonus CD are excitable and the new booklet are a dream come true, the best album from 1987 it's back whit a new sound and face, the only thing i dissapointed it's because doesn't comes the lyrics inside like the old one.  but its a masterpiece...
038572179X|1.0|If there was a zero star rating, I would've chosen that.    I have no problem with long, descriptive books, being a Michener fan. (I've read Hawaii and several of his superlong books.) But this book takes FOREVER to get the supposedly pivotal event. (It doesn't happen until at least halfway through the book.)    This book is an exercise in self-indulgence by the author. It's the written equivalent of someone who likes to talk just to hear himself talk.    One of the worst books I've ever read.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Bullitt is Steve McQueen at his finest! It's an excellent movie with an excellent cast, a great plot, top notch acting, and the \\"Greatest\\" chase scene ever filmed. Two of the most powerful street cars of the 1960's (1968 GT 390 Mustang Fastback, and a 1968 Dodge Charger) battled it out on the streets of San Francisco! If you have a big screen TV you'll enjoy feeling yourself move in your seat with the cars as they race down the hills of frisco. Cameras are mounted in the windshields for the best special effect ever. I remember when I was a kid watching Bullitt in the theater, everyone was rocking in their seats as the cars went down the hills. This movie was made when all of the actors were stars and headliners, not like today with one or two leading actors and a bus load of newbies. Also, Bullitt was real stuff - not special effects! Bullitt was made before green screens, gimicks, and computer techology had come along. The racing was real, the crashing was real, the explosions were real, and yes - Steve really drove the Gt 390 Mustang.<br /><br />Thomas

B00005R2IS|5.0|Mad Max Special Edition is great!!! Not only does it contain the actual aussy voices from the cast (Not American Overdub Like The Original), the second DVD offers the making of Mad Max and the history of Mel Gibson and his acting career. Mad Max was always a cult classic, on DVD it's a new experience.<br /><br />Thomas
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|As usual, another outstanding release from the female-fronted metal band Epica!   This album is melodic, and yet powerful. The angelic vocals of Simone Simons, the forceful grunts of Mark Jansen, combined with the crunching guitar and bass riffs from Ad and Yves, gives this album a diverse sound that will enthrall you. In my opinion, this is a giant step in the right direction by Epica. I highly recommend this album to anyone whom is a fan of melodic metal music.
B000UX6THK|1.0|Ok, this is the greatest TV show ever, nothing personal, but it's not fair to go out and buy season 2 and season 1 years ago, and just a couple of months later turns out they're re-releasing both WITH THE PILOT AND DELETED SCENES AND MORE EXTRAS than the one i bought. Is it worth it? Of course, it's twin peaks, but it's still not fair. Dang....
0486266885|4.0|A scientist invents a formula that can bring out man's dual nature. His opposite number, in this case, is somewhat of super-powered wanton, who does whatever he likes. Free of the social restraint of his other half, he happily commits any crime that comes to mind as he feels like it.    Eventually, investigators begin to suspect something, and a hunt is on for who is behind it.
0783116934|5.0|When this movie was first on television, I watched it about three times. I think I cried every time, too. The anguish and exhaustion of the undaunted investigator are heartbreaking. It is a fine piece of procedural drama, with a talented cast.
B000OY8NII|3.0|Great premise! Maybe second season will be better. The last episode showed more promise than previous episodes. Neat characters. All pretty likable.
0440238609|5.0|I bought these books because I read many professional critics gave the books high ratings.  I have to agree with the critics, the books are outstanding.  Very interesting, exciting, imaginative and creative.  They definitely compare to the Lord of the Rings.  I think these books would be good for 11 years and up.
B00005J9M3|5.0|No one tops this band live. \\"My October Symphony\\" is absolute super-rock,in its best fashion;as is the entire CD.We are not looking at a few guitars but backing by an entire orchestra,we love the strings. This is BIG SOUND at it's best. Who doesn't appreciate Tennant and Lowe for their musical genius? \\"Being Boring\\",which this CD is not, shows us how their wide range of ability can transend to musical heights. Check out \\"Very\\" as well.
B00008DDRX|5.0|There's no cutthroat, classless \\"win at all costs\\" attitude evoked by the participants in the race here. Those who walk away (and those injured) carry a sense of honor knowing they've done the best they could. Anything less just isn't good enough in this honorable cast. It's all in this movie, with a sense of realism not seen in this genre. Beautiful, simple images of the French countryside and culture merge in the setting and people surrounding the race. To so convincingly squeeze 24 hours (including tedium) as a statement of this unique event is a thrilling experience.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|The Breakfast Club is still one of the finest teen flicks of all-time. Talented and an energetic cast which includes: Emilo Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, and Judd Nelson. This is a film I can watch over and over again, it's that good! If you want a great comedy/drama then The Breakfast Club is for you. Ally Sheedy steals every scene with her strange and lovable behavior. I highly recommend checking this winner out!
B000068FXX|4.0|Not quite in the class of the two definitive Supertramp albums (Crisis what crisis? and Crime of the Century) I would classify this as a \\"partial classic\\".  A good classic should sound good now, it may have some associations with the times it was released but has to rise above the comment \\"good example of the genre\\".  Some of the tracks on Even in the Quietest Moments are classics (in particular Fool's Overture) but others sound really dated.  A must have if you like Supertramp at all, but don't get it before the true classics.
0307263118|5.0|This is a very rewarding book that requires patience and close attention because of the narrative shifts in time and place.    The story revolves around middle aged Max.  In the present, Max is grappling with the recent death of his wife.  Clearly the pair had long been a \\"unit\\" and Max is quite at loss as to what to do next in her absence.  Although he loves his adult daughter Claire, she is no substitute in his affection.  So Max is drawn back to a place by the shore that he hadn't been for 50 years, a place where he has a typical early adolesent experience with the opposite sex and an untypical experience with tragedy.  The past and present are expertly interwoven by Mr. Banville, who deservedly won his Booker for this effort.    Banville does an incredibly good job showing us the power and limits of memory and how things are remembered (or disremembered) lucidly or poorly.    I think only Ian McEwan today writes with quite the same degree of elegance.  And actually, as I think about it, I could make an argument that there are interesting similarities between McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" and \\"The Sea\\".  In each case, the narrator sees or thinks they see something that turns out not to be the case and, in each instance, with terrible consequences; although more obviously so in \\"Atonement\\".      Read it \\"The Sea\\" and see for yourself.
B000068FXR|5.0|I bought this album along with Crime of the Century in a fit of nostalgia but have certainly not regretted it.

B000002UJQ|5.0|There are some works in various mediums that are so massively influential, so monumentally inspiring, so meaningfully important that they're monstrously intimidating to review; Radiohead's OK Computer is one of those works for me. A work I feel that's not only the greatest album of all time, but it is among the finest works of art ever created. If that sounds like hyperbole, I'll qualify it by adding it's one mere person's opinion. I've yet to read a review that lends much insight into what OK Computer is. I've read descriptive reviews of the music, certainly; but in many ways I feel words fail to describe the essence of this album.    If I may be a bit abstract for a moment: I feel music's greatest quality is in its ability to evoke sensations, thoughts, and emotions that we do not have definitions for. It is the language of the divine that is as intangible as the concept of the infinite. For me, the greatest music should be that which is able to stir these undefined sensations to such a degree that we are moved, but cannot express why.    OK Computer is that album for me. A friend once asked me to define 'emotional complexity' in music. At the time I couldn't, but if complex is: \\"characterized by a complicated arrangement of parts\\" and \\"emotions\\" is merely what we feel, then OK Computer may epitomize \\"emotional complexity\\". To utilize a cliche, this is a work that gets better every time I hear it; and what it 'means' on any day is dependant upon my mood at that point in time.     All of this rambling is my attempt to lend insight into an album that I have trouble defining in words. One that could perhaps only be communicated in the most transient and euphoric of mental states. But OK Computer - to borrow a phrase from another reviewer - is 'music that moves me'. After dozens of listens I have cried at more than half of the songs on this album. And when the tears come, it's not out of sadness, but merely from being overwhelmed emotionally.    If I had to pick one transcendent moment from a wealth of them, it would likely be from the song Let Down. There is a part in its climax where Thom Yorke begins with \\"One day\\" which is the lead into the bridge. In one speaker he continues with the bridge, while sustaining the \\"day\\" in the other, escalating into a falsetto, providing an immaculate harmony with the bridge. This is a moment of such sublime, incomparable beauty that I'm brought to tears nearly every time I hear it.    If this review is useless, and lends no insight as to why myself and many others consider this the greatest album of all time, then I may have proven myself right about how impossible it is to define this music with words. I could break down what this album accomplishes in technical terms - the heavily layered, beautiful soundscapes, the complex rhythms and structures, the wealth of influences behind the album (from electronic to modern classical), the superb cohesion, the fact that nearly every song has something completely new and different to offer - but that really doesn't help explain it either.     I still believe this album is a true masterpiece, even if I cannot objectively define why. It will likely be a work that just gains status as time goes by. With works that are ahead of their time, it often takes people time to catch up to it. For those who \\"don't get\\", it's understandable. You might just not be tuned to the emotional frequency of this album. To those who do get it, consider yourself extremely lucky. I know I do.

B000MCIBB6|4.0|i just finished listening to the whole cd, except the bonus tracks. is it really necessary to hear another 2 takes of 'not to touch the earth'? NO. i've heard the cut that made it to the album, and i think it's pretty damn good. i'll give you the bad, then the good. bad: tracks 5 and 9 are the worst. 4,8, and 10 arent so great either. but the other tracks are 5 star songs, and thats why i got the cd. the unknown soldier, 5 to 1, and not to touch the earth. those 3 songs alone make this a must have.
1400064287|5.0|I found \\"Made to Stick\\" much more than a business book.  I find particular application to teaching, as well as for any other forum where the goal is to communicate, \\"sell\\" or influence.  The main points are simple and logical, though it takes someone to remind us of this to help keep us from making our efforts excessively complex (the \\"more is better\\" philosophy).  This book reminds me of \\"The Abilene Paradox\\" by Jerry Harvey in it's simplicity and power.  Because I can see application in each of their chosen careers (because they all have to formulate and \\"sell\\" an idea), I have given copies of this book to my three adult sons.  They are respectively; Software Integration Engineer, Financial Information Systems Auditor, and Professor of Classics.  My kudos to the Heaths for a concise and very readable book.
B0006L0LOS|1.0|When I first saw the previews for this particular movie, I thought it looks good, great even. But when I went to see Catwoman in theaters I was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />First off Catwoman's name is Selina Kyle not Patience or whatever her name was in the movie. That just drove me nuts! Also I'm not as familiar with Catwoman's origin story as I am with like Batman or the Teen Titans, but I'm pretty sure she was not the heir of some ancient line of cat women. I'm sure to know well about the origins of Catwoman though once the copy of Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper arrives for me at the library.<br /><br />The costume.. Wow I didn't know Catwoman was suppose to be so racey. If I had to guess the costume in Catwoman was designed for a guy's eyes. I know that Catwoman is known for her whip and tight, form fitting costumes, but it is almost always a form of a body suit. I don't think Catwoman has ever really been known for prancing around on roof tops half naked.<br /><br />In my opinion they should have stuck with a proper version of Catwoman's origins and explained them like they are explained in the comics and most novels. Also they should have kept her name Selina Kyle. I think a lot of fans were upset about the name change. It was totally uncalled for. Lastly, I think if would have been better if they went with a costume similar to the one Selina Kyle currently wears in the comics. That is such a cool costume and it probably would have been cool on the big screen.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't reccommend this. If you want to find some real Catwoman stuff read Batman Hush or maybe Catwoman: When in Rome. Something along those lines, but I wouldn't watch this movie. It sucks.
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|I was very dissappointed in Kelly Clarkson's new album. I loved her last album from the first to the last song so I was very suprised at how bad this one is. It has a very different sound that I just don't like very much. Its just my personal opinion but at least I understand now why she was fighting with her managers over this one!
B000TYWAUA|2.0|Horrible Movie.  I usually dig these kind of movies but the real story turned into an almost scifi fanatasy.
1594489505|3.0|I was disappointed with the quality of this novel after reading his first brilliant novel \\"Kite Runner\\". For sure, the story is tragic, painful and unusual for many people, but I don't see the beauty of a novel here; Khaled Hosseini does not sufficiently open internal worlds of his characters; there are not enough descriptions of senses, feelings, thoughts, perceptions and judgments of characters. Events move forcefully and fast: Mariam marries to older man ...she was scared and shuddering first night of sexual intercourse with her husband ... then \\"somehow\\" she liked him and later her husband \\"somehow\\" becomes colder to her (no any other explanation, except Mariam being not able to produce a child). How their interpersonal chemistry worked throughout marriage, I have no idea. In case of Laila, it is even worse. There is almost zero description about interaction between Mariam and Rasheed; whether her husband was awful for her or she liked being as a little flower for him, I don't know. Only thing I understand is Laila was liked by her husband. In general I feel like Khaled Hosseini retells the afghan women gossip in better way. Believe me, if you just go to Afghanistan and talk to people (if you can communicate), you would easily hear such story.     But I liked some parts of novel, specifically the part how interaction between Mariam and Laila is developing. Interesting part is enemies (Mariam and Laila) come together for survival; to stand against their common enemy - violent husband Rasheed. For Mariam, discovering the gorgeousness of a small girl Aziza was like finding a beautiful flower in the middle of a mud. Khaled Hosseini tells to his readers how far people (even intelligent and gentle women) can go to survive: being forced to commit actions like cheating, lying and even killing. I hope readers did not get impression that every afghan man is cruel and marry to a girl; gets pleasure out of it and women have to survive this. We see in the book at least one person (Mariam's father) feels guilty because of his sin committed in younger age and another person Tariq, marrying to his beloved woman, despite she was married to another man before.
0765348276|5.0|I was intrigued right from the start and found it quick paced, inventive and really quite plausible from a futuristic perspective. The characters are fleshed out (no pun intended) and interesting. Scalzi has the ability to paint a picture without tedious description. The is the only sf book I have ever passed along to my husband, who \\"only\\" reads cop books. I actually think he'll like it. Now that is what I call a good author.
1587990717|5.0|A good read and many valuable insights that will keep you thinking long after you've moved on.     Attacking this author is besides the point; frankly, why should anyone care if he is or isn't a arrogant, ivy league brat, a walking contradiction that doesn't appreciate the \\"businessman\\"?  The book is either worth the read or it isn't. My opinion - it has something important to add and does so in a fun, refreshing style to boot.

B00005M91K|5.0|This isn't a film for the casual viewer, especially one who expects something relaxing or serene -- it's not some New Age \\"moods of Nature\\" Valium! In truth, it's not meant to be watched passively at all, or used as mere soothing background. It's meant to be experienced, the way you'd experience a passionate symphony, or the immensity of the ocean or night sky. Above all, it's meant to engage the viewer, to evoke memories, emotions, dreams, fears -- often quite powerfully, even disturbingly at times. It can be as upsetting as it is exhilarating.<br /><br />And that's all to the good.<br /><br />The goal of art isn't simply to entertain (although that's certainly worthwhile in itself). It's to arouse & awaken the individual who encounters it, to stir the soul out of its dull, repetitive patterns, to make both the world & the individual come alive again. If it's successful, it changes you. And this film does all of that -- highly recommended!
B00004THDI|5.0|John Barry has always been a master at soundtracks, but with \\"Dances With Wolves\\", he truly scores high points.  This is not a standard western soundtrack, but has a wide variety of instrumental and percussion elements that make it truly unique.  The \\"Main Title\\" and slower numbers stand out as some of Barry's best.  It truly is a romantic soundtrack.  Do note that this is a stereo only SACD and not Multi-channel.  That sound not did not detract me from buying this masterpiece; only a forewarning about what to expect.

078322947X|5.0|\\"Sorcerer\\" is a 1977 adaptation of the French 1952 classic \\"The Wages of Fear\\" which curiously neither improves upon the original, nor denigrates it.<br /><br />The \\"sorcerer\\" of this film is fate, which gathers four outcast men of four different countries together. These have nothing in common but are obligated to collaborate for the same reasons, money and redemption of honour and place in their low-rent society. Their impossible task: take unstable nitro glycerine over the jungle in shabby trucks (not comfy Defender 90s and Land Cruisers) with busted shocks and fractured springs.<br /><br />This version is very faithful to the novel, which clearly presented a challenge for filming and likely busted the budget. Roy Scheider is excellent, coming off his work in \\"Marathon Man\\" and \\"Jaws.\\"<br /><br />This is a guys and beer movie: pessimistic, ironic, wor-out tools, tired souls, Sisyphean, and an unhappy ending.<br /><br />The weird score by Tangerine Dream's score actually works and the colors and soft focus used throughout create a hallucinogenic dream-like state that speaks of the sweat and exhaustion the characters go through.

0316067598|4.0|About 1/2 the book is filler. We have read a dozen times about the selection process and training regimen of Navy Seals. Skip through this and get to the \\"meat of the cocnut\\", the actual story of what happened once this Seal Team of Four got into Afghanistan. Our special ops warriors are perhaps the most lethal fighting force in the world and this book illustrates how it is their mind set as much as their muscles and weapons. Fearless patriots whose worst enemy is not Islam but a liberal media and \\"fair weather\\" support from their own government. A good example of why the military should be allowed to operate on a level with our enemy - there are no rules - war is hell - don't make these brave men second guess how they will be treated upon return. The book makes this point sadly very clear.
B000002MNL|4.0|Anyone who thinks that Morrissey only made music worth listening to while he was with the Smiths should spend some time getting acquainted with Vauxhall and I. Released in 1994, this album shows the Mozzer channeling the spirit of his glory days; in its finest moments, Vauxhall and I matches the sheer emotional power of albums like the Queen Is Dead and songs like \\"This Charming Man.\\" The whole thing positively gushes with the things that made Morrissey so great in the first place- the lyrics are pure twisted poetry, full of razor-sharp wit and lovelorn angst, while the music is nothing short of gloriously offbeat pop.     Just listen to those songs! \\"Now My Heart Is Full,\\" the album's opening salvo, is a stunningly gorgeous ode to solitude and shyness, a symphonic blast of sheer emotion that sees Morrissey's voice arcing its way over a dreamy swirl of guitars. The chorus is downright breathtaking.  There's also the dark, cynical \\"Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself,\\" in which yours truly recounts a lifetime of being betrayed, used, and lied to. The performance (as well as the gloomy yet oddly upbeat melody) rings with tension and bitterness. Closing out the proceedings is \\"Speedway,\\" which is another blinding burst of unbridled pathos. These three masterpieces form the foundation of the album, but they're by no means the only good songs here: \\"Hold On To Your Friends\\" is a dark, subtly barbed paean to self-sacrifice, while \\"Spring-Heeled Jim\\" is a wonderfully moody rocker that features hazy swirls of guitar feedback twisting around Morrissey's unsettlingly dreamy vocals. \\"The Lazy Sunbathers\\" is sunshine pop for a solar eclipse, with its lilting rhythms and apocalyptic lyrics.     To be fair, this isn't a perfect album; there are a few week tracks here. \\"I Am Hated For Loving\\" is a dull ballad with uninteresting lyrics and a melody that isn't nearly as beautiful as Morrissey wanted it to be. I could also do without \\"Lifeguard Sleeping, Girl Drowning,\\" which does nothing musically or lyrically. Plus, Morrissey's whispered vocals are really annoying. \\"Used to Be a Sweet Boy\\" does have a slightly beautiful melody, but its potential is squandered by Morrissey's pained vocals and melodramatic lyrics.    But, a few duds aside, this really is a fantastic album that belongs in the possession of any fan of the Smiths or Morrissey.
B000O599ZS|5.0|Arguably, this is the best movie John Wayne ever made.  The other candidates are \\"The Shootist\\" and \\"True Grit\\".  Of course, Wayne got the Best Actor Award for \\"True Grit\\".  He should have gotten one for this movie.      Wayne is admirably supported by a number of Wayne-movie regulars, such as Ward Bond, who plays the leader of a band of Texas Rangers, and Harry Carey, Jr.  Olive Carey, the mother of Harry Carey, Jr. and wife of famous western actor, Harry Carey, has a part in the movie.  In fact, Wayne pays a tribute to Harry Carey in the final scene of the movie where he stands silhouetted in the front door holding his right forearm with his left hand.  This was a common gesture of Harry Carey.  Jeffery Hunter, Vera Miles, and a young Natalie Wood round out the cast.  Hunter does a particular good job as Wayne's young sidekick.  You also will be able to pick out a young Festus Haggen (\\"Gunsmoke\\") aka Ken Curtis.  He plays the part of young guy who tries to woo Vera Miles away from Jefferey Hunter.    Overall this is a great movie.  The writing, directing, acting and cinematography are superb.

B00005JPKE|5.0|While there were some \\"slow\\" areas in the film, it was nevertheless an OUTSTANDING film due to the unparalleled realism of the the actors in their respective wartime roles, providing great insights into the \\"Bushido\\" code thinking of the officers versus the thinking of the common soldier.  It also showed both positive and negative actions of each side (Japanese soldier versus American soldier), and shows how real leadership inspires the soldiers.  The second bonus disk is a great addition to this movie.  I highly recommend this 5+ star movie.  This was much better than \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\".
0786939532|5.0|Homeland follows the story of Drizzt from around the time and circumstances of his birth and his upbringing amongst the drow (dark elves). The book takes the reader into Menzoberranzan, the drow homeland. From here, the reader follows Drizzt on his quest to follow his principles in a land where such feelings are threatened. In an essence, the book introduces Drizzt Do'Urden, one of Salvatore's more famous characters from the Icewind Dale Trilogy    This book is the reason I became a fan of RA Salvatore.  It is core reading for anyone interested in fantasy, Drow, or just want to read a wonderful adventure.

B000VK7KVQ|5.0|The great David Fincher outdoes himself on this unusual film. Incredible suspense, fascinatin in its procedures, brilliantly acted by the entire ensemble (though I am  partial to Gylenhall and Rufalo in this) this criminally underated and underseen film deserves a wide, and ultimately appreciative audience. The frustration comes from the fact that the crime was never solved..but even that is handled in a most satisfactory matter. Is it too early to talk about directing and writing Oscars?
B000RJO578|4.0|Hot Fuzz is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seeen. It combines British wit with ridiculous humor and plots, and throws in some explosions for good measure. I was cracking up the entire time I watched it (and even on repeat viewings). The DVD has some issues with slight skipping and the subtitles are off in a few spots, but that does not interfere with watching the film. All in all, well worth the money.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|I was amazed at how much different Richard Donner's version of the film was compared to the original Superman II. They basically made a 'new' movie by throwing in as much of his original footage as they could while keeping the overall story consistent and coherent. The mood of the movie is much darker than the original, more serious, but it was the way it was meant to be filmed.  As for the DVD itself, I was a little disappointed that they didn't add any real special features. You open it up and see only a DVD in there; no chapter lists on the side or anything. It's basically a disk with the 'new' movie, an intro by Richard Donner, a short documentary about restoring the footage, and subtitle options. But still; the movie is a masterpiece that would make Christopher Reeve proud if only he were still alive today. The movie is also dedicated to him.

0743289412|5.0|I thought this was a great book! I have never been a giant fan of Mr. King (nothing personal, I think the storys a great, but just too gorry for myslef), however This one I read on a chance, and loved it!     Yes, the writing style is unique, but without it, the book wouldn't be what it is. The language, writing, and the way the story unfolds is why it is so great. Showing that soulmates, and true love exsists, as well as phsycopaths, is what makes this book worth every page. I earge every person who had a hard time reading it, to listen to it read via the audio book. Hearing it read vs. reading it, (in this perticualr book anyways) will make all the diffrence, for someone sitting on the edge of the fence on it. Give it more then a chance, excpet it as it is, and read it, you won't be disapointed

B0007G89G4|5.0|Rob Reiner and Stephen King collaborated on this classic and the wealth of their talent resulted in the sort of movie that's good every time it's seen. Based on The Body, one of King's novellas from his early `80's collection Different Seasons, and staying mostly faithful to the King tale (with the inexplicable exception of changing the setting of Castle Rock from Maine to Oregon) Stand By Me features a gifted cast of young actors who get the most out of a story that was already rich and multi-faceted. Concerning itself with a quest undertaken by four boys moving through the gray zone between childhood and adolescence, all of them seeking to locate the body of a missing local boy whom they know to have been struck and killed by a passing train, Stand By Me, as with The Body before it, is actually so much more than its surface plot, and is nothing short of a coming of age masterpiece that examines loss, destiny, and the journey toward a deeper understanding of human life. This is one of those movies that captures the story on which it was based, learns from it, and becomes something great indeed. At times funny, awkward and carefree, at others frightening, poignant, tragic, and starkly realistic, Stand By Me Is probably the best adaptation of a Stephen King work that's ever been done.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This 1998 HBO 12-episode series ought to be in the movie collection of every American household. It dramatically documents the events beginning with Kennedy's mandate to the American people in 1961 that we put a man on the moon before the end of the decade. It continues with Neil Armstrong of Apollo 11 taking \\"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\\" on the lunar surface in 1969. And it ends with Apollo 17 in 1972 and an imaginative recreation of George Melies' 1902 film, Le Voyage Dans La Lune (A Trip To The Moon). It also has a great selection of extras.<br /><br />Each episode has a different cast, director and writer, so there is a different style to each one. Some may like this and some may not. However, the same actor does play the same astronaut throughout; so, if an astronaut went on more than one mission, that actor will play him again in the episode about that mission. Tom Hanks executive produced and opens each episode with a nice monologue. He also wrote Part 12 and co-wrote Parts 6, 7 and 11, directed Part 1, and starred in Part 12. Interestingly, Sally Field directed and starred in Part 11.<br /><br />From The Earth To The Moon boasts a strong cast - many of them big television names - and some turning in wonderful performances. Most of the directors and writers are solid, but there are a few less-than-stellar showings. Overall, and considering that this is a TV mini-series, not a theatrical film, it's excellent. Space fans will still want to own The Right Stuff and Apollo 13, which form nice bookends for this series.<br /><br />Here's a list of the 12 episodes, contained on five discs, with a few brief comments about each:<br /><br />Part 1 - Can We Do This? - Good opener setting the stage for the Apollo program. Covers the period of 1961-65 and includes several voyages by the Mercury and Gemini programs.<br /><br />Part 2 - Apollo One - Interesting investigation into why Apollo 1 caught fire, killing the three astronauts on board in a matter of seconds. David Andrews stars as Frank Borman, Mark Rolston as Gus Grissom, Chris Isaak as Ed White, Ben Marley as Roger Chaffee.<br /><br />Part 3 - We Have Cleared the Tower - Interesting \\"reporter's eye view\\" of NASA and, specifically, Apollo 7, as a documentary crew follows the astronauts around, interviewing them and various other personnel. Mark Harmon stars as Wally Shirra, John Mese as Donn Eisele, Fredric Lehne as Walt Cunningham, Max Wright as Guenter Wendt.<br /><br />Part 4 - 1968 - Alternating with scenes of social unrest caused by the civil rights movement and anti-war demonstrations, the assassinations of King and Kennedy, and riots at the Democratic Convention in Chicago, the crew of Apollo 8 prepare for the first manned voyage to orbit the moon. David Andrews stars as Frank Borman, Tim Daly as Jim Lovell, Robert John Burke as Bill Anders.<br /><br />Part 5 - Spider - Terrific episode on the research and building of the Lunar Module, called \\"Spider.\\" Conor O'Farrell stars as James McDivit, Brett Cullen as David Scott, Kieran Mulroney as Rusty Schweickart, Steve Hofvendahl as Tom Stafford, John Posey as John Young, Daniel Hugh Kelly as Gene Cernan.<br /><br />Part 6 - Mare Tranquilitatis - Good episode about Apollo 11 and Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon. Tony Goldwyn stars as Neil Armstrong, Cary Elwes as Mike Collins, Bryan Cranston as Buzz Aldrin.<br /><br />Part 7 - That's All There Is - Quirky episode about the Apollo 12 team who were best friends and each owned the same gold Corvette. Paul McCrane stars as Pete Conrad, Tom Verica as Dick Gordon, Dave Foley as Al Bean.<br /><br />Part 8 - We Interrupt This Program - Disappointing story about one of the news anchors covering the Apollo 13 voyage. The crew hardly even appear! Lane Smith stars as Emmett Seaborn, Jay Mohr as Brett Hutchins, Tim Daly as Jim Lovell, Adam Baldwin as Fred Haise.<br /><br />Part 9 - For Miles and Miles - Interesting story about Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard recovering from an inner ear disorder that had grounded him for ten years, the healing of which now enabled him to lead the crew of Apollo 14 at age 47 - and walk on the moon. Ted Levine stars as Alan Shepard, George Newbern as Stu Roosa, Gary Cole as Edgar Mitchell.<br /><br />Part 10 - Galileo Was Right - Super episode about a professor of geology that NASA hires to turn the astronauts into geologists so they can understand what they're looking at when they investigate the lunar surface on the voyage of Apollo 15. David Clennon stars as geologist, Tim Daly as Jim Lovell, Tom Verica as Dick Gordon, Brett Cullen as David Scott, Michael Raynor as Alan Worden, Gareth Williams as James Irwin, John Posey as John Young, Zeljko Ivanek as Ken Mattingly, J. Downing as Charles Duke.<br /><br />Part 11 - The Original Wives' Club - Interesting but tragic record of what happened to the astronaut's wives due to the stress of their husbands' jobs. Directed by and starring Sally Field.<br /><br />Part 12 - Le Voyage Dans La Lune - Terrific ending to the series. Not only do we get the Apollo 17 voyage, but we also get to see a recreation of George Melies groundbreaking film of 1902. Tom Hanks wrote and stars as Melies' assistant, Daniel Hugh Kelly as Eugene Cernan, Tom Amandes as Jack Schmitt.<br /><br />Bonus features include a wonderful behind the scenes featurette, a special effects featurette, John F. Kennedy's historic speech, and various still features, plus some trailers.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithabled him to lead the crew of Apollo 14 at age 47 - and walk on the moon.

0553381695|4.0|This is a good follow up to A Game of Thrones.  Like many other readers, the period setting and charcterization are the strengths of this book.  The point of view narration is a stand out.    I don't mind getting lost in a good book.  If you're looking for loose threads to be tied up and tight plot adherence, you will be disappointed.  This is not a G, PG, or PG13 fantasy epic it is R or even X rated in places.  Sometimes, I found the sex and violence  gratuitous. Just a caveat emptor.    I liked the characterizations.  They were believable.  For instance the good guys (all right, the characters I liked best) were not saint like and brilliant 100% of the time.  Small side characters that seemed all right in Game show themselves be less than savory in Clash.  There are some new POVs in this novel as well.  The most interesting being Davos, a knight serving Stannis Baratheon.  The bad guys,show that they are not static caricatures.     Plot developments were believable in that again it didn't turn on magic but mundane events.
0893860220|5.0|This book can only be described in the format of the writing. The interviewer gets annoying due to his unnecessary struggle with the universe of philosophical and existential crisis. However; the words of Maharaj exhibit a sort of brilliance, a sort of light, that CANNOT be put into terms of a book-review. Buy this book not to read every sentence from start to finish, but to expose yourself directly (on any page) to the light of the mind of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.
0394873742|3.0|I was excited to get her this BIG book because she loves to look at books and point to the pictures and I name them for her...she is 12 months old.  I thought she would sit on the book and look at everything but I think there is too much going on and it keeps her attention for about 1 minute and then she goes and gets one of her other books.  The other thing that I don't really care about with the book is that things have \\"weird different names\\" to identify them (pumpkin car, etc).  Maybe she'll grow into it...time will tell!
B00007LTIB|5.0|If you consider yourself a fan of progressive rock, or are just \\"prog-rock curious\\", you must own this album.  It defines everything that is appealing about the genre and stands as the high water mark for the era.      Compared to the somewhat overwrought concepts of \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\", \\"Relayer\\" offers what Yes fans really wanted - an album they could have fun listening to.  It's been about 30 years since I was first introduced to these songs and I am still blown away by them.    There is no other Yes album that so magnificently showcases the virtuosity of musicianship, without sacrificing the listenability factor.  Think \\"Fragile\\", only more so.    This is the album that certified Steve Howe as the most innovative and impossible-to-imitate guitarist alive.  His mind-blowing riffs on each of the three tracks seem too difficult and complex for a mere mortal to manage, but he does it while effortlessly transitioning between rock, fusion, classical, country and even flamenco styles.  This album should have a warning label to all guitarists not to try this stuff at home.  You're better off sticking to your AC/DC records.     The same can be said for Alan White, as this is by far the most impressive drumming he's ever contributed.  His playing style here is aggressive, creative and in-your-face, but without upstaging the songs.  Check out the tempo changes on \\"Sound Chaser\\".  You'll swear it's a special effect.    The writing is brilliant as usual.  Jon Anderson gives us a story that we can actually get into in \\"Gates of Delirium\\".  It's a narrative that works and makes for a very brisk 20 minutes of music.  The other two cuts, \\"Sound Chaser\\" and \\"To Be Over\\" are also examples of Yes genius in their ability to seamlessly blend musical motifs, from fusion to rock and from classical to jazz.  You'll Rock Out and Space Out all within the span of about 40 minutes!      Chris Squire is at the peak of his powers here as well, but he does not assume the position of \\"star\\" on this outing.  His playing, while also superb, mostly serves as the cement that binds these exceptional pieces together.    Patrick Moraz makes his first and only appearance on a Yes album here, but it might have some Wakeman fans asking, \\"Rick who?\\".  Moraz is a master keyboardist whose solos are so funky and audacious that they will leave you a bit giddy.  Again, check out \\"Sound Chaser\\".    The production value is second to none.  In fact, the recording is so clean and precise that it will have you wondering what decade this thing was made.  As an analog record, it easily stands up to anything digital that's come out recently (and makes you wonder what the hell happened when they got together for \\"Tormato\\").    Buy this CD and listen to it over and over.  If you're under 30 years old it might make you sorry you weren't born in an earlier time because they definitely don't make 'em like THIS any more.
B000002HPV|5.0|Okay I never really knew a lot about Bj&ouml;rk. I mean I've seen her on TV plenty of times wearing that infamous 'Swan Dress,' but I never heard her music. That is until I was watching SNL and she preformed \\"Earth Intruders\\" and I enjoyed it because it was new, original, and I needed a break from all this rap/hip-hop stuff that is 'in.' So... I was like, 'what the heck, I will give it a try,' as I was looking at her albums on Amazon.com. As I saw the album cover to Homogenic, I was shocked and amazed all at once. It was so beautifully scary and just looked like wild chaos was contained beneath. By far, the best album cover I have put my eyes on. (And if you look really close at her eyes in the picture, you can see they are all black with a big white ring in the inside of her black eyes. I also love her hair! WOW! Oh and her fingernails lol, its so bewitching) I just have never seen anything like it before and basically I bought it for the cover and all the hype about \\"Pluto.\\" (Volta wasn't out at this time) So I ordered Homogenic as my first Bj&ouml;rk album, and waited to see if I liked it. I was wrong. I LOVED IT!  But not at first. You see, the album grows on you. You have to take time to really appreciate it and each song for what it truly is.<br /><br />Hunter:  A- (4.5/5) A curious, but brilliant way to start the album. Actually it is the perfect choice. I expected this video to have Bj&ouml;rk preparing to go out into the woods to go hunting. But she was bald and morphed into a bear on and off. Oh well, still love the song! \\"I'm Going Hunting!\\"<br /><br />J&oacute;ga: A+ (5/5) My favorite ballad off of this album. It's so well done and composed. Great choice for the first single. Deep and meaningful lyrics. It's true in every sense. The video to this song fits it very well, and should be re-done with all the new technology today. I can't wait to buy the J&oacute;ga Singles CD. 'Emergency is where I want to be!'<br /><br />Unravel: A+ (5/5) I didn't like this song at first but it grew on me, a lot. When I am fully into the trance of this song, it is already over and it leaves me wanting more. Every time I listen to it, it makes me want to unravel like a ball of yarn, as it is, and just relax. Very peaceful song. Almost Heartbreaking.<br /><br />Bachelorette A (4.5/5) I don't think this was the best choice for a single, as there are other, better songs than this one, but it is still good, don't get me wrong, it's just that Unravel or All Neon Like is more deserving of the title. However, I do love the ending to this song. Who would have thought an accordion would make such a perfect ending? Oh, and the video is so outlandish! I can't even describe it, but the tide will show you the way... (Some of the beats to this song are reminiscent of \\"5 Years\\" if you listen closely.)<br /><br />All Neon Like: A+ (5/5) Clever Lyrics: \\"Not till you 'halo' all over me\\" or \\"Nourish Your Turtle Hearts...\\" (although I still don't understand some of the lyrics in the song, I love it all) But I enjoy the vibe to this song. When I am in the car I like to have this one on full blast. Such a shame this wasn't a single. It would have loved to seen the video for this neon-beauty.<br /><br />5 Years: A (5/5) Good song. Sounds like Bj&ouml;rk is a little upset and wants revenge on someone as 'she dares you... (and) what's so scary, there's not a threat in sight' :) I also really enjoy the beat to this song as well. It's like the speakers are shuffling and melting at the same time.<br /><br />Immature: A-- (4/5) My least favorite song of this album. I don't know why, but it just doesn't seem as strong as the other powerful songs. Maybe because it is the shortest song on the album. I still like it, but when I am fully into the song, it's over. However, I do like the lyrics a lot, it's just the weakest of the ten.<br /><br />Alarm Call: A (5/5) Okay back on track, this song has a 'Jungle Beat'. This is an incredible song, and I love how she chants, 'it doesn't scare me at all .... I'm no f*ucking Buddhist, but this is enlightenment' The video is a little racy, but it is all good! Now, since track 3, Unravel, all of the tracks have flowed nicely. Finally 'Immature' morphs into 'Alarm Call' and you expect this song to flow with 'Pluto' because the songs have been flowing. But when 'Alarm Call' ends, it doesn't flow with 'Pluto' because 'Pluto' is on it's own different level, it's own different planet if you will--pardon the 'pun.'<br /><br />Pluto: A+ (5/5) WOW, that's the only thing I said when the song was over. I couldn't believe what I just heard. It was like the whole entire album had been leading up to this moment. This explosion. This crazy world-wind of a song. Now I love techno/electronica/dance, and all that kind of music, but as the song starts out, I thought I knew what I was going to get, but I was wrong. The song got stronger and stronger still until she screams and screams and releases just about everything for this triumphant song. Icelandic Techno is what I have heard it called. (And what a beautifully crazy thing it is.) It's like this song is a super-sonic blitz filled with jack-hammering pulsating vibes that never stop. And I don't want this song to stop either. I thought I have heard everything, but not when I heard this. You are either going to love or hate this song, and I hope you love it as much as I obviously do. Oh and as a word of advice, don't sing to this song too much, as you will most likely lose your voice. Trust Me! This should have been a single, but, I don't think the \\"general\\" people would understand, what this song is truly all about. Whenever I am infuriated and mad, I play this song to release the pressure off me, and it works!<br /><br />All Is Full Of Love: A+ (5/5) After the 'climax' of this album, (Pluto) everything stops. It slows down and changes into this beautiful song. I like this version, but the video version is much, much, MUCH better. But the album flows so better with this version, so I can see why she chose the 'original' one over the video one. This song, in my opinion, gave 'Homogenic' its name. If you have seen the video, these two robots are obviously kissing and making love. Now it seems to me that both robots are neither female nor male. But they are the still the 'same.' It's my favorite video off the album and possibly the most touching song to me.<br /><br />**As for a favorite song... I can't choose. I obviously love \\"Pluto,\\" just because it's so mind-blowing, but I fell in love with \\"J&oacute;ga,\\" and I'm still falling in love with it. \\"All Is Full Of Love\\" is so heart warming and loving. (And we can't forget, \\"All Neon Like\\" or \\"Unravel.\\") I guess I don't have a favorite because each song is like its own little gem, each one a different shape, size, color, and sparkle. You can't compare something so different from one another. Although 'Homogenic' does mean one in all the same, like pebbles. It is an interesting title for a lovely interesting 'different' kind of album.**<br /><br />- You could skip all I wrote up there, just read this:<br /><br />It is well worth your time and money. As this album is way (and still) ahead of it's time. I gave Bj&ouml;rk a try, and I am hoping you will too. I was so glad I did. This album is amazing and I love it to death.

B00001U0DP|5.0|I had the privilege of seeing LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (LA VITA E BELLA) in the movie theater, right after star and co-director Roberto Benigini had won a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor.  There is no other word to describe it.  This film is beautiful, and it definitely makes you appreciate and value life more.<br /><br />I know some people have trouble picturing a film whose subject matter is the Holocaust that starts out as such a bubbly comedy.  But, that is exactly the tone that the director and writers (Roberto Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami) developed, and it's brilliant.  Guido (Benigni) is a young, Jewish-Italian man with a wonderful sense of humor and a gusto for life.  He falls madly in love with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), a beautiful woman who he continues to pursue (even when she is engaged to be married to another man!).  Of course, love conquers all.  However, the second half takes a decidedly different turn when he and his son (Giorgio Cantarini) are placed in a concentration camp.  This is when Guido's inventiveness and imagination become invaluable tools in shielding his son from the horrors they encounter there.<br /><br />It is rare that I see a film that leaves me so breathless as this one does, ten years later.  This is the film that Roberto Benigni will be most remembered for, and for good reason.  I suggest that you watch this for your heart, your soul and your spirit.  Be sure to have a box of kleenex and prepare to lose yourself in the spellbinding beauty of this movie.

Taleb covers a lot of ground, at times in seemingly sporadic jumps, but each chapter is a mini research library in itself. The reviews for this book span the whole gamut, and I will not try to add to the noise short of saying that if you are interested in probability, in how it affects our lives, and how it skews our perception of the world, then you should judge the book for yourself - I happened to have read it twice.

0140157352|5.0|Despite the common perception, negotiation is not about winning, it's about coming up with a resolution which benefits both sides. In order to develop such an agreement you have to be willing to listen, and to understand the opposing side on both the personal and business levels. 'Getting to Yes' teaches us how to develop these skills. From personal issues, to tactics, to psychological tricks, to best alternative (BATNA) analysis, Roger Fisher covers a lot of ground in this classic. The book is short and to the point, and serves as a great launchpad for further research in the area.

On the down-side, however, the book is more than a bit repetitive, and would benefit from at least a chapter or two on self-help for adults.  (Realistically, on the other hand, it is not too difficult to figure out appropriate strategies for oneself while reading through the book.)
0316067598|5.0|This book captures the essence of what Navy SEALs are about. They are  warriors that abide by the rule of law, while at the same time they are trained to complete their mission, no matter how difficult, including giving their life, if necessary. From the day they graduate from training, the brotherhood associated with being a Navy SEAL is lifelong and remains their strongest bond. Marcus Luttrell, a hard working farm boy from East Texas, was reared with strong family values, that emphasised standing on one's own feet and never giving up. This held him in good stead as he suffered through the toughest military training in the world. Following graduation from Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) Training, he honed his war fighting skills in Iraq and then in Afghanistan, where he exhibited extraordinay courage in the face unbelievable odds that challenge the very definition of \\"Hero.\\" This book is a barn burner that is near impossible to put down. Throughout, he conveys compassion, humor, loyaly and patriotism, while at the same time giving no quarter when it comes to honoring the Navy SEAL's philosophy,   \\"We train for war and fight to win.\\"
0743455967|5.0|The chief ingredient of great writers is honesty; honesty in the development of the characters; honesty in their dialogue and honesty in their commitment to their craft.   Stephen King, one of the most qualified people to write about the subject of writing, offers this kind of honesty in this book.       The first part of the book is a memoir of his life; a life that has always been inseparable from his writings from a very early age.    The second part of it is where he really delves into the techniques and styles of writing and his philosophy on the craft.        In the second part of the book he covers vocabulary, which he considers should be placed in the \\"top shelf of your toolbox, and don't make any conscious effort to improve it\\".  He claims that this will come later as you continue reading and feels that \\"one of the really bad things you can do to your writing is dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you're too ashamed of your short ones\\". He uses Hemingway and Faulkner as examples of consolation.    He continues with grammar where he makes clear the necessity for working knowledge of it as a way to organize prose in a readable manner and his disdain for grammatical purity.   It is obvious that he writes for the reader and not for the English professors of the world.  How ironic, that these are the writers that eventually get studied by the professors and impose upon their malleable students.     He also covers interesting topics, such as active and passive verbs, where he admonishes one to \\"avoid the passive tense\\" and feels that writers who used them, do so for the same reason that \\"timid lovers like passive partners\\".   And like passive verbs, King sees very little use for adverbs, considering them the artifacts of lazy writers and mostly redundant.    The book goes on to explain his stance on plots, dialogue, similes, metaphors and symbolisms.   Stephen King's love for the craft is obvious and evident throughout the book.   For anyone who loves to write, this book will offer great tips and entertainment.  I loved the book and found great benefit in it.   Enjoy!
B000000Y1H|5.0|For all intents and purposes, this is Monk's debut album as a leader: he had issued several 78s and an album of Ellington covers under his own name beforehand, but this was his first recording of all originals. Even for Monk, this is some weird stuff, especially \\"Ba-Lue Bolivar Ba-Lues-Are\\" (or just \\"Bolivar Blues\\", as it was later retitled)  - it's amazing how he twists a genre as familiar as blues to sound totally foreign, thanks to his bizarre melody. Always the compositional virtuoso, Monk threw a curveball at everyone with the winding title track, which was too hard for any of the musicians in question: it was composed by splicing several takes together. There's also an odd beauty on the rarely heard \\"Pannonica\\", where Monk plays a Celeste. A couple of these tracks became classics, such as the joyful \\"Bemsha Swing\\" (which I believe was held over from the Blue Note years) and \\"Bolivar Blues\\". The only weak track is a dry recording of the boring chestnut \\"I Surrender Dear\\" - for whatever reason, I've never been into Monk's solo piano recordings, even though he's a great piano player. Why? I have no clue. I'm just weird like that, okay?

0374530718|5.0|What a wonderful book! We are truly extraordinary beings, and this book will show you this. Prepare yourself to embark on an exciting journey of the mind--you'll come back a different person. The author will take you on a journey to the minds of the past philosophers, and in the process, within your own mind. You'll find out that it is easier to ask philosophical questions than to answer them. Philosophy is not something you can learn, but perhaps you can learn to think philosophically.    A \\"philosopher\\" really is one who loves wisdom. The only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder. Babies have this faculty. But as they grow up the faculty of wonder seems to diminish. A philosopher never gets quite used to the world. To him or her, the world continues to seem unreasonable, bewildering, and enigmatic. To illustrate, a child is sitting on a baby chair having his breakfast. Suddenly, he sees his father float in mid-air. At the same time his mother sees her husband floating in mid-air, drops the dishes on the floor, and screams. Why is that? To the child, seeing his father float in mid-air is exciting but nothing unusual. After all, everyday he witnesses something new. To his mother, however, it is an impossibility to have a person float in mid-air.  She is a creature of habit, stuck in a certain reality. A child's reality is unlimited and ever expanding, just like a philosopher's world. The world is also floating in space!    Because man thought it was so astonishing to be alive, philosophical questions arose on their own accord. By philosophy we mean the completely new way of thinking that evolved in Greece about six hundred years before the birth of Christ. Until that time people had found answers to all their questions in various religions and myths. Greek philosophers attempted to prove that these explanations were not to be trusted. The philosopher Xenophanes, who lived from about 570 B.C., said that men have created the gods in theirown image. \\"They believe gods were born and have bodies and clothes and language just as we have. Ethiopians believe that the gods are black and flat-nosed. Northern Europeans imagine them to be blue-eyed and fair-haired. If oxen, horses, and lions could draw, they would depict gods that looked like oxen, horses, and lions!\\" So philosophy gradually liberated itself from religion.     What is the origin of the universe? At some point something must have come from nothing. But that notion was soon changed to `something cannot come from nothing', therefore all that is always existed. This meant that there is something of everything in everything. Once it is accepted that nothing can change, that nothing can come out of nothing, and that nothing is ever lost, then nature must consist of infinitesimal blocks that can join and separate again. This was the theory of Democritus, and for this reason he is today credited with being the inventor of the most ingenious toy in the world--Lego. The world consists of blocks, just like Lego blocks, that can join and separate again and form unlimited forms. Today we know this to be true. DNA is such an example.    Socrates said that the wisest is he who does not know. He said, \\"One thing I only know, and that is that I know nothing.\\" The essential nature of Socrates' art lay in the fact that he did not appear to want to instruct people. On the contrary he gave the impression of one desiring to learn from those he spoke with. So instead of lecturing like a traditional schoolmaster, he discussed. Similarly, Socrates saw his task as helping people to \\"give birth\\" to the correct insight, since real understanding must come from within. And only the understanding that comes from within can lead to true insight.    A philosopher is constantly striving to achieve true insight. Let's examine the following analogy presented by Plato: Imagine some people living in an underground cave. They sit with their backs to the mouth of the cave with their hands and feet bound in such a way that they can only look at the back wall of the cave. Behind them is a high wall, and behind that wall pass human-like creatures, holding up various figures above the top of the wall. Because there is a fire behind these figures, they cast flickering shadows on the back wall of the cave. So the only thing the cave dwellers can see is this shadow play. They have been siding in this position since they were born, so they think these shadows are all there are. Imagine now that one of the cave dwellers manages to free himself from his bonds. The first thing he asks himself is where all these shadows on the cave wall come from. What do you think happens when he turns around and sees the figures being held up above the wall? To begin with he is dazzled by the sharp sunlight. He is also dazzled by the clarity of the figures because until now he has only seen their shadow. If he manages to climb over the wall and get past the fire into the world outside, he will be even more dazzled. But after rubbing his eyes he will be struck by the beauty of everything. For the first time he will see colors and clear shapes. He will see the real animals and flowers that the cave shadows were only poor reflections of. But even now he will ask himself where all the animals and flowers come from. Then he will see the sun in the sky, and realize that this is what gives life to these flowers and animals, just as the fire made the shadows visible. The joyful cave dweller could now have gone skipping away into the countryside, delighting in his new-found freedom. But instead he thinks of all the others who are still down in the cave. He goes back. Once there, he tries to convince the cave dwellers that the shadows on the cave wall are but flickering reflections of `real' things. But they don't believe him. They point to the cave wall and say that what they see is all there is. Finally they kill him. What Plato was illustrating in the `Myth of the Cave' is the philosopher's road from shadowy images to the true ideas behind all natural phenomena.    Many philosophers believe that the search for God is natural to all men. Sartre believed that life must have meaning. It is an imperative. But it is we ourselves who must create this meaning in our own lives. To exist is to create your own life. Swami Vivekenanda, an Indian who was instrumental in bringing Hinduism to the west, once said, 'Just as certain world religions say that people who do not believe in a personal God are atheist, we say that a person who does not believe in himself is an atheist. Not believing in the splendor of one's own soul is what we call atheism.     In `As You Like It' Shakespeare writes:  All the world's a stage,   And all the men and women merely players:   They have their exits and their entrances;   And one man in his time plays many parts.     Spinoza says that God did not create the world in order to stand outside it. No, God is the world. He believed that God--or the laws of nature--is the inner cause of everything that happens. He is not an outer cause, since God speaks through the laws of nature and only through them. For example, does a lion decide to become carnivorous? Can a lion suddenly decide to become vegetarian? Similarly, do humans have freewill? For that matter, does God exist in the first place, or is God a creation of our mind? Hume gives us a theory. According to him, an 'angel' is a complex idea. It is a false idea which must be immediately rejected. Why? Have you seen a human being before? Of course you have. Have you seen wings on birds before? Of course you have. Have you seen wings on a human being? According to Hume, none of us have. In this case we have to admit that the brain has done a good job of cutting and pasting together all on its own. Each element was once sensed, and entered the theater of the mind in the form of a real impression. Nothing is ever actually invented by the mind. The mind puts things together and constructs false 'ideas.' But Hume emphasizes that all the elements we put together in our ideas must at some time have entered the mind in the form of simple impressions. For example, a person who has never seen gold will never be able to visualize streets of gold.    Are we living in a world of dreams? Is the whole world made off spirit, and thus nothing solid? Let's say you hit a table with your fist. You had a sensation of something hard, but you didn't feel the actual matter in the table. In the same way, you can dream you are hitting something hard, but there isn't anything hard in a dream. We exist only in the mind of God. So 'to be or not to be' is not the whole question. The question is also who we are. Are we really human beings of flesh and blood? Does our world consist of real things--or are we encircled by the mind. According to some philosophers, we are spirit, and nothing in our world is solid! Novalis said that 'the world becomes a dream, and the dreams become reality.' The English Romantic poet Coleridge expressed the same idea; saying something like this: What if you slept? And what if, in your sleep, you dreamed? And what if, in your dream, you went to heaven and there plucked a strange and beautiful Flower? And what if, when you awoke, you had the flower in your hands.  Ah, what then?    We live in a complicated and mysterious world. If an overgrown child draws something on a piece of paper, you can't ask the paper what the drawing is supposed to represent. Similarly, we are like the paper, with events drawn on us. But what do these events signify? What is the truth behind life? According to Kierkegaard, rather than searching for the Truth with a capital T, it is more important to find the kind of truths that are meaningful to the individual's life. It is important to find 'the truth for me.'     You and I also began with the Big Bang, because all substance in the universe is an organic unity. Once in a primeval age all matter was gathered ina clump so enormously massive that a pinhead weighed many billions of tons. This 'primeval atom' exploded because of the enormous gravitation. It was as if something disintegrated. When we look up at the sky, we are trying to find the way back to ourselves. Beautiful! Now you know why you look up at the sky when you are in search of God!    But what is this earthly substance? What was it that exploded that time billions of years ago? Where did it come from?' These questions concern us all very deeply because we ourselves are of that substance. We are a spark from the great fire that was ignited many billions of years ago.    In case that spark has extinguished in your life, this book will rekindle it. Read this book--you'll love it!

157912626X|2.0|After reading a number of Hercule Poirot novels, I decided to give Agatha Christie's other famous detective a try.  Enter Miss Jane Marple in The Body in the Library.  When a married couple wake up one morning to find a dead girl in their library, they call Miss Marple to help them clear up the mystery.  It seems that no one even knows who the poor girl is, let alone how or why her body got into the house.  Working in her own somewhat eccentric style, she sets out to find the murderer.  In typical Christie fashion, we start to assemble a motley array of suspects for Marple to talk to until she unravels the mystery.    One thing you definitely have to give Christie credit for is that Miss Marple is no female knockoff of Poirot.  She is an old Spinster who seems to be able to immediately predict anyone's behavior by comparing them to various people who live in her village.  Once she matches the stranger with the correct villager, she seemingly knows everything they are capable of.  Frankly, I found this to be pretty unrealistic and even irritating by the time I was halfway through the book.  It's all so pat and simplistic that it's pretty ridiculous.  I do think the overall tone is meant to be tongue-in-cheek but I can't say it worked for me.  Compared to Poirot, Sherlock Holmes, Nero Wolfe, and nearly every detective series I've tried, this one just didn't interest me enough to want to read a second Miss Marple novel.  Don't get me wrong, it's far from the worst mystery novel I've read, it just wasn't particularly good either.  I would only recommend it to those who are already confirmed Marple fans.
B000QGAU4E|1.0|What a great concept for a movie and what a poor execution of it!  The story is that the world has gone sterile (no more babies being born) but nature has fought back and one woman is finally pregnant.  Trouble is, she's not part of the \\"preferred\\" class and the upper-echelon would disect her and her child if given half a chance.  Clive Owen is called into service to shuttle her through numerous dangers and get her to a rebel group called \\"The Human Project\\" where she'll be safe.  The downside to this movie is that it takes FOR FRIKKIN' EVER to tell that story and there's way too much exposition that takes place.  The story moves about as slow as molasses on a cold day in January.<br /><br />There are good performances.  Clive Owen does great.  Michael Caine is hilarious with his \\"pull my finger\\" bit.  Some of the other lesser-known actors turn in competent performances as well.<br /><br />The movie just lasts too long and moves way too slowly for me to reccommend anyone see it...unless you've got insomnia and need something to help you go to sleep.  It's a shame because when I heard the premise for this story, I thought it was going to be a real winner.

The movie was rather dry and boring, with little emotion displayed. I do not recommend this film... especially not as an accurate depiction of this timeless story. If you a true Jane Austin fan, or just enjoy the book, the best representation of this classic story is the BBC one.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|My only gripe with this purchase is the packaging.  It looks nice and as previously stated - the box is attractive and the folding organization looks good.. but the actual folders that hold the $200 DVDs is really cheap and does nothing to protect this investment, which to me seems unacceptable from a $200 purchase.      So we went to Target and bought a dvd binder with zip closure to hold all the discs with the protection I expected from my $200 purchase.  So. when you buy this... get something else to protect the dvds.  This is kind of too bad because the box it comes in looks so nice on display, but it's empty and useless and I can't throw it away.      I love this TV show and otherwise I am very pleased with the investment.  I couldn't even take off a star for the poor packaging.
1400049628|4.0|This book was an impulse purchase, I mean who doesn't like zombies?!?! It was a decent quick read, if at times it was almost too much like a survival handbook, sometimes getting boring to the point that I wanted to skip to the end of the section on climates and terrains. The end stories about 'real' zombie attacks was interesting and full of ideas for other writers to pick up (looks like Brooks might have jumped on this idea with his follow-up book).

0060763299|5.0|The author provides a wealth of information on how rich people think.<br />For instance, rich people don't dwell on the past or envy others with money.<br />Major characteristics of the rich are as follows:<br />1.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|References to 'Oldboy' abound with words such as ultra-violent and gory.  And yet, in the end, the gore is psychological rather than physical (though cutting out your own tongue with scissors is an admittedly bloody feat).  'Oldboy' is a film entirely in a class of its own, mixing mystery, violence, and a plot that mind-bendingly unravels to a surprising conclusion.  'Oldboy' plays well, it looks great, and is satisfying at every level; plot, action, story, and twist.  The helping hand lent by the New Zealand Film Unit ensures crisp cine and those jagged, snow-topped Korean hills are as sharply captured as claw-hammer dentistry or the ingestion of a live octopus.  Bon Appetit!
B000QXDED6|4.0|\\"300\\" is based on a graphic novel by comic \\"it\\" man, Frank Miller.  Miller based his graphic novel on a series of truly heroic events that happened during the battle of Thermopylae.  Basically what you have here is a true story that sounds as if it is from a comic book getting the comic book treatment.  That's what makes this film so great at times and so mundane at others.  Director Zack Snyder knows how to guide an epic speech, as is done on a number of occasions in this film by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler).  He also knows how to make a battle scene look really cool.  Despite knowing the fate of the Spartans, I cheered them on during their battles with the Immortals and others.  However, much like a number of action and sci-fi yarns of today, Snyder uses visual stylings and CGI effects as a crutch.  Yep, it's cool to watch a man stand down a rhino and even watch a wall of bodies crush a soldier.  However, had Snyder realized just how truly amazing the real story of the Spartans at Thermopylae was, he might have cast off Miller's comic version and gone for the real thing.  In short, the comic bookishness of this movie takes it down a notch.  Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy comic book films as much as anybody.  The problem with this depiction of the Spartans, though, is that the real story is so much better than the comic book version.<br /><br />Seeing this film as nothing more than a comic-to-the-screen adaptation, it works very well.  The action is brutal and swift and, as I stated before, you will pull for the Spartans.  Xerxes (Rodrigo Sanford) gets the larger-than-life treatment, but his god-like voice is sort of funny.  The weapons, the armor, the helmets, and even the animated beasts from Hell all look excellent.<br /><br />If you have no idea as to who or what the Spartans, Xerxes, or the battle at Thermopylae are, you'll really dig this film as a wonder of action and violence.  Heck, even if you do know about the real events and people involved with this story, you'll enjoy this movie as an action yarn.  I highly recommend it to fans of comic book movies.  I also recommend it to history buffs, but the \\"razzle-dazzle\\" aspect of the film might make it less enjoyable to you.this movie as an action yarn.

B00005JPMZ|3.0|This film is okay. It appeals more to elementary school kids at most. What's good about this film is the 3D animation and the voice casting of the turtles and April and Casey. The only voice that really bothered me was Master Splinter's. He sounded like he had a dry throat the entire time. The plot is a little weak. It focuses mostly on the relationship between Leonardo and Raphael which is a disappointment because it's supposed to be about four turtles not two. They're also supposed to find 13 monsters that have been around thousands of years and put them in a portal. They've been around for that long and some how haven't made the news. Anyway Leo's supposed to be a better leader so he leaves and we find him in Central America or somewhere around there in the beginning of the film. When he comes back everyone, but Raphael accepts him back. Raphael has been moonlighting as the Nightwatcher, a vigilante in the night. Some how none of the turtles, or Master Splinter for that matter, figure out that it's him. Not that many guys looking to kick evil's ass at night and since he's asleep all day and out all night what could he be doing?! Another problem is Casey and April. Casey is going around at night fighting criminals with a bat and a hockey mask. Raphael I understand. I mean you see him wearing cool metal armor and he's got martial arts. Plus two small knives which he's deadly with and a motorcycle. You san understand why he hasn't gotten killed doing this, but Casey is doing the same thing and doesn't have any of the advantages that Raphael has. He doesn't even drive anything. He just walks! How come he isn't dead? I don't know. April is first presented as an archaeologist which is believable, but later we see her fighting with a sword against thousands of ninjas. Her and Casey make it out alright for some reason. The turtles are in this fight too and them I do believe making it out alright, but an archaeologist and a tough guy against ninjas? Come on. There are twomore   good things though. One is the music. When you hear it in the movie it just fits in with the scenes. Particularity a scene in where Raphael, as the Nightwatcher, is fighting a little monster. The other good thing is the opening scene in which two armies are fighting each other. It's a cool thing to watch on screen. However, this film would've been better if the story was different. If they had begun the story with the turtles origins and had then face the Shredder ending with Leo's departure it would probably have been more entertaining. This film has some decent action and voice casting(for the most part), but it is a film you could live without seeing.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I was taken to see this film almost against my will. I'm not sure why that is, but I'm glad I saw it. I'm amazed that this film wasn't more popular. It's beautifully written and is an incredible breath of fresh air for Hollywood that seems to be spending most of it's time pairing stars to do remakes of 80s TV shows or other movies. This movie is funny in a subtle way but also inspirational. I think I'd like to be buried with a copy.
0143038583|5.0|This book sheds light on our food system in a way that most books fail to, whatever the subject. It is not a diatribe against eating meat, as many wrongfully assume. Rather it is an honest glimpse into the life cycle of food. This sounds bland, but the book is flavorful! Pollan's writing is completely engaging, the science and journalism presented are fascinating, and the journey he goes on to bring us the story that he does is an adventure. You simply can't go wrong with this one.

1400032717|4.0|Christopher Boone hates the colors yellow and brown. He lives with his father, and tells us that his mother died of heart problems years ago. He can calculate the number two up to the forty-fifth power in his head. He loves Arthur Doyle's Sherlock Holmes books. And he is the highly intelligent, autistic narrator of Mark Haddon's novel The Curious Incident of the Dog In The Nighttime. Using deceptively simple prose, he tells us a story of love, betrayal, and family.   The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime opens sensibly with an incident involving a dog in the nighttime. Christopher, as he tells us in his book, finds a dead dog pierced through with a garden fork as he is walking through his small English town. The dog, Wellington, belongs to his neighbor Ms. Shears, and despite the fact that she knows Christopher and his father well, she is less than pleased to find him holding her dead pet. She calls the police, and because of his communication problems, Christopher is soon being held in jail. We are introduced to Christopher's father when he barrels into the police station to take Christopher home, obviously frustrated with having his son arrested. Although Christopher is determined to find the dog's killer, his father forbids him from pursuing it and meddling in other peoples' business.   Throughout the book, Christopher states unusual facts about himself, including his aversion to being touched, his photographic memory, and his inability to lie. Despite the fact that Christopher can't lie to his father, his passion for finding Wellington's killer drives him to find ways to break his father's rule. His search for this \\"murderer\\" leads him to changes and revelations that neither Christopher nor the reader expects.   I loved this novel because it was engaging, well-written, and narrated in an unusual way. The novel pulls you in and makes you just as curious as Christopher to know who killed Wellington; the answer is by no means the only surprise in the story. In fact, Mark Haddon's wildly successful first novel earned him both the Whitbread Book Of The Year Award and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize Overall Best First Book Award. By using an autistic teenage boy as the protagonist, Haddon lets us see things through a fascinating new perspective while also showing the difficulty of caring for an autistic child. Because Haddon worked with autistic individuals as a young man, he is able to realistically depict the condition.   I thoroughly enjoyed The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Nighttime. It grabs your interest from the first page and immerses you in a remarkable story while still managing to seem, for the most part, realistic. Despite the fact that his writing style can seem detached and even cold, it's surprisingly easy to identify with Christopher. I found myself alternating between sympathy, empathy, and exasperation at his thoughts and experiences. Although I felt like this book would appeal mostly to a teen or young adult audience, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the condition of autism or wants an interesting, quick read.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|Advantages:<br /><br />1) HD-DVD/DVD dual format so fans that don't have HD-DVD can watch and enjoy the show.<br />2) New visual effects.<br />3) Beautifully restored high definition transfers<br />4) Nice packaging (at least for the shell itself)<br />5) The new visual effects are often stunning(the second season episodes \\"Amok Time\\" and \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" were the most impressive--not included here but \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" and other first season episodes look terrific as well. It should be noted, however, that some fans have had issues with the new visual effects being inaccurate but these are mostly nitpicking).<br />6) If you decide to get an HD-DVD player you'll be set to roll with this DVD.<br />7) Newly recorded score, new prints struck from the original elements,some new extras including home movies shot by extra Billy Blackburn, the ability to navigate outside the ship, look at the development of the new visual efects and a couple of new featurettes highlight this set.<br /><br />Disadvantages:<br /><br />1)In a format that hasn't proven its staying power yet and you're paying for it.<br />2)Way too expensive<br />3)Sort of a double dip<br />4)Some have complained that the digital visual effects don't have the surface detail of a model or even of the original Enterprise visual effects.<br />5)Not available in Blu-Ray for those that don't have HD-DVD players.<br />6)The packaging could become easily damaged in shipping.<br />7) Dual sided discs which tend to be more easily damaged than single sided discs.<br />8)HD-DVD only Special Features that will play only on HD-DVD players (not on DVD machines).<br /><br />Previewed at Comic Con, the new set will please those fans that have HD-DVD although the price for this set won't. Those that enjoyed the recent syndicated run of the series with its new visuals will also enjoy this set.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a terrific series and the first season had some of the best episodes however this is way too expensive even considering that it is in a HD-DVD/DVD dual format. Why? Because some fans may not want to commit to the new HD-DVD format since we don't know which format is going to win the high definition format war. The bottom line is that Paramount/CBS has miscalculated pricing this at an insane price. Sure many fans will buy it but I doubt that it will sell in the droves that Paramount/CBS wants it to.<br /><br />Final Words:As always the series itself is terrific and this, along with the bulk of the second season, was the original series highmark. The new visual effects when they are effective only enhance the original film. Also, it hasn't been reformatted for widescreen so it keeps the original aspect ratio (black bars appear on the sides of the screen).<br /><br /> Ultimately your decision about whether you want to get this depends on how badly you want it given the price. Priced at nearly TWICE the original DVD box sets, my advice is to wait until Paramount lowers the average retail price or grab it at a deep discount while you can.<br /><br />More info on the set (added): The content has all the first season episodes. I suspect that \\"The Cage\\" will probably be held over (as with the original box sets) for the third season as an enticement for fans since that is the worst selling of the three seasons.

B000002LR3|5.0|If you've only listened to the more recent Primal Scream albums (which are all decent to really good), you owe it to yourself to find a copy of Screamadelica.  This is an early '90s gem that I only discovered towards the end of the 90's.  Every track is interesting and will weather multiple listening sessions.  Some standout tracks for me are \\"Higher than the Sun,\\" and \\"Come Together.\\"  The latter is just a fantastic track - a classic \\"shaggin\\" track, some might say.  Perhaps, perhaps not.  However, I strongly urge all fans of great rock, great rock ALBUMS, to get your hands on this album - certainly available for a reasonable price at any decent Used CD store - or online!

B000FG5Q1W|4.0|I am a fan of Give Out but Don't Give Up, so I enjoyed this album.  Primal Scream is one of the most interesting bands around today.  From their trippy earlier albums to their turn at Industrial/ Dance, they are constantly open to creating new sounds, instead of recreating their \\"hits\\" as so many other bands do nowadays.  While this album is nothing radically new, I did enjoy it much more than say, XTRMNTR or Evil Heat.  The first track \\"Country Girl\\" seems to have gotten the most airplay, but think that my favorite track is \\"Sometimes I Feel So Lonely,\\" a slower, more soulful track.  This album is very \\"country rock,\\" but it's also very accessible to both new Primal Scream listeners and long-term fans.  Enjoy!

Out of the Star Wars films, this is probably my 2nd favorite, but Revenge of the Sith is pretty close.  My favorite SW film is naturally Empire Strikes Back.

B00004VXF2|1.0|MMM  was a brave act for Lou Reed at the height of his 70s career.   However as a piece of music, MMM just doesn't hold  up.   If  I compare MMM to other challenging (unusual) pieces of  music  (John Coltrane's Ascension, Anything by Cecil Taylor, Lemonte Young's Well Tuned Piano, Capt. Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica....), MMM just doesn't have the depth that these other pieces have.    With that said, as a Velvet and Lou Reed fan I sought out a copy of MMM on vinyl in my youth, and do not regret shelling out the $$ for it.  It does clear out the room faster than shouting \\"Cops at the door!\\".   I even digitized the vinyl, and tagged it as  \\"Noise\\" genre (along with Yoko Ono).    If you really need to hear/experience MMM, I recommend purchasing the \\"Between Thought and Expression\\" CD which  has a small 3 minute or so excerpt from MMM along with a reasonable collection of Lou Reed tracks from 70s and 80s.
B000LYX84K|5.0|\\"Long Live Rock 'n' Roll\\" from 1978 was the third studio album from Blackmore & company and the first following the live \\"On Stage\\" release.<br /><br />Over the years critics have taken the greatest pleasure in their often biased descriptions of \\"Heavy Metal\\" music.  Unfortunately either from the critics  lack of knowledge or a mind too closed for thought the consumer is often left to sought out the good from the obnoxious.<br /><br />There are certain bands that produce metal sounding music if you like the term, but it is imperative that the word \\"Intelligent is placed before the word heavy.  The Black Sabbath records with Ozzy, the first 5 Blue Oyster Cult, the one and only Armageddon with Keith Relf, the Deep Purple records during Blackmore's tenure, and the Rainbow with Dio at the vocal helm.<br /><br />While the first two studio Rainbow went more for the mystical sound, \\"Long Live Rock `n' Roll has enough metal around the edges to produce carnage if anything enters its path.  The opening track (The title) is not only perfect for its placement as the first notes the listener experiences but is relentless in the pure energy and brilliance.  Many a Blackmore fan wouldn't let the turntable go to the second cut before they were inundated with the sonic explosions from the first song a myriad of times.  \\"Lady Of The Lake\\" mixes nicely the pure rock and roll with the Dio mystical vocal.

B000A158T2|5.0|I gotta write a five star review to eliminate that dumb review at the bottom, I meen even for the PSP this has got to be the best horror film of all time.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|One of the best season's of the best series on television! Top notch writing, acting, and dialogue. I can't say enough good things about Gilmore Girls!
B0001ZXM54|3.0|Meant to rate it 4 1/2 stars...not perfect, but very good. Unfortunately, I hit the three star button. This set is better than three stars.  Great collection of songs. Though some are missing from various albums. Like \\"Need You Tonight\\" and \\"Thug\\" from Eliminator aren't on this CD set, but it's a very good set.
B000IZJZLM|2.0|Considering the fact that I love Il Divo and their exceptional voices, this CD was a major disappointment.  The songs are blah and unoriginal, and the sound quality of the CD is the worst I've heard in a long time.  The producer of this waste of money needs to go back to the drawing board.  Il Divo's heavenly voice deserves better.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Director Alejandro González Iñárritu has pushed his multiple-narrative concept further than he did in his previous \\"21 grams\\" and in \\"Babel\\" he handles four interlocking stories. For all the unanimously strong acting, however, I just didn't find myself drawn into the world it depicts as \\"21 grams.\\" In \\"Babel\\" things look unnecessarily convoluted.    For me the most impressive part of \\"Babel\\" is the story about the family living in the Moroccan desert. There two kids accidentally shoot one of the American tourists with a rifle (though they don't know the consequences until much later). These two child actors are amazing with natural and compelling performances, better than Brad Pitt and Cate Banchett as the stranded travelers, and their actions, not wise but credible, well-represent the ripple of the butterfly effect. Actually with their stories alone \\"Babel\\" could be a great film with its message \\"Tower of Babel\\" intact.    So, why should these stories in Africa be connected to the other two parts about the American couple's nanny and Japanese high school girl? Though each story is well acted, American and Japanese sections are weaker than those about the Moroccan family. Yes, after some slack moments these two stories finally deliver; one in the desert and the other in Tokyo apartment and ruptured timelines are not hard to follow thanks to the skillful editing, but the abrupt wrap-ups (especially the first one) is very disappointing.    I know the director's flair for interlocked narrative, and he uses it quite tactfully here, but I think a simpler approach would be as effective as that. Or more effective perhaps.

B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard's Hysteria album is proof of rock 'n' roll's triumph over adversity.  When Rick Allen lost his arm in a car accident, that didn't stop them. They soldiered on.  Three years of hard work finally paid off although the record was slow in selling during the first year of release.  But when the hits finally came, they came in a big way.  Soon after the release of the album, the band launched its in-the-round arena tour.  The five men from Sheffield, England were finally beginning to enjoy the fruits of their labor. With hits like Pour Some Sugar On Me, Love Bites, Armageddon It, Hysteria, Animal, and Rocket, the band was on top of the rock world.  The only weak track would be Women, which begins the album.  But other than that, the production and engineering on the album is flawless.  Def Leppard however did mitigate their heavy metal sound after Pyromania and many true metal fans would complain that Hysteria was wimpy compared with their earlier work.  However, when all was said and done, they would emerge as successful as they now appealed to a wider audience.    Teenage girls, especially, couldn't get enough of them as they played to sold-out auditoriums.  However, Steve Clark began to really hit the skids as his alcoholism really took its toll.  He would not live to see the band's fifth record as he died comatose in a gutter from a fatal mixture of alcohol and other drugs.
1582701709|3.0|The power of positive thinking taken to the extreme that our thoughts bring all blessings and calamities into our lives.  I do believe in the power of positive thinking, but I am not prepared to leap to the conclusion that ALL catastrophes and accidents are caused by the negative thoughts of their victims.  Sometimes, disaster rains on the optimist as well as the pessimist.      Chapter 4, Powerful Processes, is probably where I got the most out of the book, though the concepts were not new to me.  Gratitude, otherwise known as \\"counting your blessings\\" has helped improve my attitude and outlook on life when I have used it.  Visualization is a tool I used very effectively as an amateur athlete, but not as well in other aspects of my life.  I had a bit of an epiphony when I read to visualize movement, not just a picture.  That's why it worked better when I used it as an athlete, because it always involved motion.    I suspect there are books promoting more reasonable expectations of the efficacy of positive thing, gratitude, and visualization.  I'm going to read Karen Kelley's Secret of the Secret to see if it covers these concepts in a more realistic manner.  If so, it may be a good starting point for those who are new to them.    I remember reading in Zig Ziglar's See You At the Top something like, \\"There are two ways to get to the top of an oak tree: sit on and acorn or climb a tree.\\"  The Secret seems to say, \\"Visualize yourself at the top of an oak tree, convince yourself you are already on top of an oak tree, and somehow circumstances will work out so that before you know it, you will find yourself on top of an oak tree.\\"  I'm with Zig, start climbing if you want to get to the top of the tree.  Visualizing the climb and believing you will make it help you do it sucessfully, but you still have to put forth some effort and climb to get it done.    In conclusion, true principles, but oversold.
B00005JPRZ|5.0|My partner and I loved this movie.  We laughed our butts off.  Very British Humor at its very best.  This is a movie I cannot wait to purchase on DVD when it becomes available.

0385333846|1.0|This is supposed to be a classic, and I finally got to around to reading it.  I did not find it to be good satire, good science fiction or good anything.  Not even a good read.  Not particularly profound.  It is graphic and profane at times.  It is too cynical and defeatist for my taste.  The point I got is: no sense in trying to change anything, things are going to happen the way they're going to happen and nothing is going to change them.  The \\"war is bad\\" message in chapter one is lost in the confusion of the remaining chapters.  I might have liked it better in college when being cynical and blase was cool.      WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD         The story is mostly narrated from the point of view of Billy Pilgrim.  The storyline goes something like this:  Billy is drafted into service during WWII.  His father dies while he is in training.  He loses his mind less than a month after being put in the warzone (during the Battle of the Bulge), is taken prisoner, and is sent to Dresden as a prisoner of war a month before it is firebombed.  He survives the firebombing, is put to work in the corpse mines in its aftermath, and is a prisoner there until the end of the war.           The narrative is disjointed because it jumps to other points in Billy's life before and (mostly) after the war.  A six page summary of his life at the beginning of chapter two helps the reader keep it straight.  The rest of the story, as near as I could put it together, follows.  Billy resumes his college education after his discharge from the army.  He is briefly committed to an insane asylum near the end of college (the doctors attribute the breakdown to a couple instances of childhood trauma, not the war), and a fellow patient introduces him to the work of an obscure science fiction writer whose works influence his future delusions.  He finishes school, gets married, becomes a successful and wealthy optometrist, and has two children.  In 1964 he meets the obscure science fiction writer workingin newspaper circulation (bullying paper boys and girl), and invites him to his 18th wedding anniversary.  In 1968 he survives a plane crash that kills his father-in-law, and his wife dies of carbon monoxide poisoning when she reaches the hospital.  That seems to be when the time traveling, alien abduction delusions begin and are interwoven into his memories; his daughter said he'd never mentioned alien abduction and time travelling before the crash.  After he is released from the hospital, he sneaks off to New York City determined to tell his alien abduction story on TV.  He picks up an article on a missing porn star whom he works into his delusion.  He also picks up a couple books by the science fiction writer, which he works into his delusion.  He gets on a radio program for a while but is kicked off during a commercial break when he starts talking about aliens.  His daughter goes to New York and takes him home.  Then he starts sending news article about aliens to New York.  His daughter starts taking over his practice and his life because she assumes, probably correctly, that brain damage from the plane crash is making him delusional.

It is also cool to see Al Garth is still at it on sex[sax] and violence[violins].

B00005JOHC|5.0|This is the funniest show on television today.  I can't believe that US audiences have had to wait so long to get this DVD set.  I can't wait to see it.  I didn't start watching until it moved into the time slot Raymond was in so I missed the early years.  Does anyone who already has the set know if the vanity cards that display (ever so briefly) at the end of every show are on the DVDs?  They are hysterical also.  If you don't know what I'm talking about go to Chuck Lorre's website and check them out.  You have to pause the show right at the end to see them.  It's easy with Tivo and so worth it!  I'm ordering my set today.  Bring on season 2 (and 3, etc!!).

B000M4RG42|5.0|Bought this for Father's Day, as my late father was a Navy Medic in Iwo Jima, just as the main character in the film.  It was moving in so many ways, primarily to see what he went through, but never spoke of.  The Marines had no medics, so they borrowed them from the Navy.  They carried no weapons, and saw the most horrific action.  The scam fostered by the government was an indictment and an embarrassment, but part of our history that must be told, and the Native American experience was also something I was not aware of.  A must see for all Americans.
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|So, some of my friends come up to me and tell me about this band \\"Wolfmother\\". I had read about them in Guitar World magazine, and they seemed alright. I heard \\"Joker and the Theif\\" and \\"Woman\\" and truely thought these guys could be the future of pure rock n roll. There was the Robert Plant-like vocals, hard hitting drums and bass and a nice little guitar riff remeniscient to \\"Baba O' Riley\\"(on \\"Joker and the Theif\\", anyway). My freind burns me the album, I listen to it and what do I think?       This band is a knockoff of the 70's rock styles that we all know and love. Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, The White Stripes and even prog like Yes are all here. \\"White Unicorn\\" for example. They didnt write that beggining riff. I swear I have heard it somewhere else from a 70's rock band. On \\"Apple Tree\\", it resembles The White Stripes to the fullest. \\"Woman\\" is obiously similar to Zep or Deep Purple.       One of the things that bothers me the most is how little soul they put in their music. No emotion. The scream at the beggining of \\"Demention\\" is absolutely godawful. When I started the album and heard that, I was furious that this Plant wannabe singer doesn't even try hard enough. if your going to imitate an amazing rock singer, do it well.       Oh and the lyrics? Dont even get me started. They suck. Alot of rockers diss punk bands for having terrible lyrics, but what the F*** is this?? The lyrics could have been written by my little 10 year old brother, or really any nerd in your science class. It's just sort of sad how they try so hard to pull off that fantasy style that Dio did so well, and crush it to the ground. \\"She's a Woman if you know what I mean. You better listen, yeah listen to me. She's gonna set you free!\\" Come on!        Some of the stuff they do is cool. The flute solo in \\"Witchcraft\\" blows me away everytime I listen to it. \\"Vegabond\\" is a pretty cool song too. This band isn't terrible, but their not great either. I like a little more thathalf the album, but it's not one of my records that get heavy rotation.        All in all, it's a decent album. The hype is to much though. Take a listen yourself to see what you think. There is absolutely NO comparison to the greats who they are often compared to. If i had actually bought this instead of had it burned, I would have put it on my iTunes and sold it the next day.       Well, thats all I have to say.          S.P.A.M
B000Q6GXW2|4.0|This highly stylized re-telling of the Battle of Thermoplyae, takes you into the darker side of that historical conflict. Frank Miller (the world's oldest 15-year old) uses his unique and rather bleak world-view as a focusing lens for his latest film. The Spartans are called upon to hold off the largest army the world has ever seen, and after an epic battle, they are killed to a man (no spoilers here, the story is over 2,000 years old). High production value, moderate over-acting, gut-wrenching action, too many lens filters and mutants. What else do you want?
0156027321|5.0|This book is worth spending the money and the time to own and read it. Even if it turns out not to be your favorite, it will probably rank pretty high.

I'm agnostic (not an atheist, but without religion), and I loved it, but so did my friend Claire (\\"That's one of the best books I've ever read!\\"), who is considerable more religious. Complex characters, the power of description, and honest fiction make this book unforgettable. You forget it's fiction it seems so real. This book breathes.
B000ROALCG|5.0|I thought this was a excellent cd to listen to . I was disappointed with my area not showing it in more movies. I felt this showed me they care about foul talking music instead of music to dance to.
B00005R2IS|2.0|I thought this movie was boring and it didn't let you get to know any of the characters.  The only good thing in this movie is a young, cute Mel Gibson.
B00005JPQL|5.0|In the summer of blockbusters and sequels, and sequels that are blockbusters, there's one movie you really need to see.  And to be honest, I really hate it when people tell me that.  So let me apologize for using that hackneyed line, but nothing else truly fits.<br /><br />I have to admit that I hadn't read STARDUST the novel by Neil Gaiman until I discovered the movie was coming out. Then I saw a trade paperback edition on the bookshelf of one of my favorite bookstores and picked it up. I'd intended to get around to reading it sooner, but ended up waiting until I was having a new stereo installed in my car. I read the book during the time I was waiting. Not to say that I waited a long time, but that the book read so easily and captivated me with the simple story line.<br /><br />The movie emulates the novel in so many ways. Gaiman's stripped-down prose does double-duty as a book and as a screenplay. It's easy to see why Hollywood took such an interest in developing the property.<br /><br />The story is all about love, but it's draped in the whimsical and fantastical that seems to spin so easily from Gaiman's imagination. There are actually two love stories involved in the movie. The action centers around young Tristan Thorn (played by Charlie Cox). However, the story actually begins eighteen years before that when his father, Dunstan, slipped through the gap in the Wall and entered the enchanted lands on the other side.<br /><br />The story of young Dunstan's seduction is quickly told and narrated by Ian McKellen. McKellen's voice lends authenticity to the tale in a pairing that's at least as good as Peter Falk's voiceovers in THE PRINCESS BRIDE.  (Expect that movie to come up often as reviews are posted about STARDUST!)<br /><br />In the book, Dunstan got married and had other children.  In the movie, he raises Tristan alone. Dunstan (eloquently played by Nathaniel Parker) has a deep love for his son and believes that he can do anything. Tristan is more of the opinion that he is a failure and doomed to eventual nothingness.<br /><br />Tristan's true undoing lies in his unreturned love of Victoria, a pretty girl in the village where he lives.  Upon learning she is going to be married to Humphrey in one week, Tristan tries to impress upon her how much he loves her and to what ends he would go to achieve her love.<br /><br />While Tristan is trying to win Victoria, the King of Stronghold (Peter O'Toole in a short but stellar role), one of the kingdoms within the enchanted lands, lies dying. He's surrounded by his seven sons. Three of them are already dead, but the other four are vying for the throne. Only one of them can become the king. Even as that particular plot point is being presented, one of the sons is killed in a way that is both horrifying and comical. The king sets his sons on a mythical quest and at each other's throats at the same time. A magical spell hurls his necklace onto a collision course with a star and causes the star to fall from the heavens where it assumes human frm.<br /><br />When Victoria sees the falling star, she tells Tristan to get it for her and she will marry him. Tristan tries to get past the old wall guard in a moment that was as unexpected as it was last-out loud hilarious. His father comes to his aid with a Babylon candle, a magical artifact with great power.<br /><br />Needless to say, things go wrong.  Badly. But this is, after all, a fantasy story and bad can become good.<br /><br />I don't want to talk about the plot anymore because it will give too many things away. Once you start to unravel the plot, there's no safe place to stop. The King of Stronghold's sons quest for the necklace that the star, Yvaine, unknowingly has in her possession. But even more threatening, a trio of wicked witches begins to pursue Yvaine with the intention of cutting her heart out and eating it because doing so will restore their lost youth and power.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer plays the evil witch Lamia tothe hilt.  This is an excellent role for her because she is seductively evil.<br /><br />Robert De Niro masterfully plays Captain Shakespeare, the leader of a band of pirates that steal lightning from the stormy skies and sell it to venders. Captain Shakespeare is an amazing character and De Niro's portrayal of him will take your breath away. And you'll never quite see De Niro in the same light again. Who knew he had this kind of range?<br /><br />All through the movie, though, you'll find that parts feel familiar, and even some scenes seem similar to other things you've seen. It's all true, but that's why the film works so brilliantly. Neil Gaiman has dipped into the universal mythology of stories and pulled out a winner.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film on several different levels. My nine year old readily agreed to go with me, but I had to cajole my wife into accompanying us. She wasn't certain she would like this kind of film. (She still hasn't seen THE PRINCESS BRIDE.) She generally prefers mysteries, and there's no hint of a mystery surrounding this film - though there are some definite clues about the surprises that take place at the end of the movie.<br /><br />The visual aspects of the film are wondrous. I loved how the villages looked and how the fairy market was set up. The scenes aboard the pirate ship as it flew through the air were amazing. I know it was all computer-generated, but it just looks so real.<br /><br />STARDUST gets my vote as the pick of the summer movie crop without hesitation. If you haven't seen it, do so.De Niro masterfully plays Captain Shakespeare, the leader of a band of pirates that steal lightning from the stormy skies and sell it to venders.

B000NVIGC0|3.0|One of the happiest mysteries of the past decade is how Jeff Tweedy - the less talented member of the seminal alt-country outfit Uncle Tupelo - has evolved into a peerless experimental rock bandleader whose increasingly innovative work remains grounded in an accessible, rootsy ethos. In part, this transformation has been driven by a revolving cast of muses - musical luminaries like Jay Bennett and Jim O'Rourke who have pushed Tweedy's Wilco to set the bar higher on each release. With Sky Blue Sky that mantle has shifted to avant garde jazz guitarist Nels Cline whose New Monastery - an audacious interpretation of Andrew Hill's music - was one of the most interesting records of 2006.    Against such a backdrop, anything less than a once-in-a-generation album would have suffered from high expectations. And while Sky Blue Sky is still a solid release, it falls far short of its promise, instead landing near the top of that largely risk-averse, roots-and-jam-band genre known as \\"dad rock.\\"     Musically, Sky Blue Sky is a mature follow-up to the band's 1996 release Being There, a remarkably incisive, guitar-driven, theme piece on bridging the gap from small town to big city and from youth to adulthood. The songs are impeccable; Tweedy sprinkles in a few well-timed George Harrison licks, and percussionist Glenn Kotche, a longstanding enemy of the standard backbeat, mixes up the rhythms enough to engage listeners, but never lets them forget it's a rock album.  Still, Wilco has traversed much ground since 1996. A throwback does not do them justice.     There are two exceptions, the back-to-back \\"Side With The Seeds\\" and \\"Shake It Off.\\" The two traverse miles of musical ground in a manner not attempted since the days of early Pink Floyd or Selling England-era Genesis. Cline earns his paycheck here, adding textures that turn what would otherwise be simply solid compositions into mind-blowing psychedelic affairs.     To be sure, many of the other songs on Sky Blue Sky will be welcome additions to the Wilco canon once they've been worked out in the live arena. But at their core, they're a step back both musically and lyrically.
1416523359|2.0|I have been waiting to read this book for a while and I was so excited when I got it in the mail.  I eagerly opened the book and read page one, then I read page one, then I read page one. I kid you not, I read page one 3 times.  I have made it to about page 50 and I can't get past the smucking, as someone else has mentioned.      I am a HUGE King fan and always have been but I put this one down in favor of Blaze.  I just started it tonight and have already read more of it in one evening than I did of Lisey in 3 days combined.    Please someone tell me it will get better and that there is a reason for me to pick it up again!    I love his books like Thinner, Desperation, Insomnia, Gerald's Game, but there are a few that are just slow and leave me terribly disappointed in my favorite author!

B00001OH7P|5.0|David Bowie was such a great pioneer of glam rock/progressive rock/fantasy rock.<br />The entire album continues the space theme centering around Ziggy Stardust.<br />Particularly outstandind is the wonderful disco funk of Suffragette City, the fantastic theme song Ziggy Stardust, the harder rock of Rock 'N' Roll Suicide and most memorable the charming Starman.<br />But this album, originally released in 1974,  is such a work of art in itself, and is a self-contained fantasy story in rock form much like Queen's [[ASIN:B000000OBJ Queen II]] released in 1974.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|If this one doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you're probably dead. I love this fairy tale. Very good casting.
B000QXDED6|4.0|More of an artistic interpretation of an historical event, told from the Spartan point of view. Xerxes was not an 8ft. tall transvestite, but the casting of him as one was entertaining. The most impressive part of the film was the visual stimulation via costumes, characters and cinematography. The Spartan men were quite beautiful to look at, and the creative interpretation of the various Persian warrior's attire, while being historically completely off the mark, were imaginative and  interesting. In summary, the whole movie was visually stimulating, albeit extremely liberal in its historical interpretation of the actual event. Mindless fun.

1582701709|3.0|If you read the introduction, back cover, or the inside flaps, and the subject matter does not sound familiar, this might be a great buy for you. I enjoyed this book. Its well organized and written, but I had two issues with it for those thinking about a purchase. 1) The ideas and tools the book discusses have NEVER been a secret. Further, they've been written about many, many times before, and in recent works, such as [[ASIN:0425150755 The Aladdin Factor]]; [[ASIN:1571743812 Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting: The Astonishing Power of Feelings]], [[ASIN:0743269519 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]](and others aptly listed by other reviewers) and also in other not-so-recent works such as [[ASIN:1585426016 The Science of Getting Rich]]. The editor of the Secret admits she discovered Wattles' writing, which is almost one hundred years old, before beginning to put The Secret together. Wattles' work was supposedly a catalyst for her, and 2) The book talks more about the theory and ideas behind this internal work than it does about putting it into practice in your life. And it does require something of a person, to put into practice in your daily life, the ideas given here. It isn't magic, it's hard, internal work. Although it's true that many people will find the ideas radical if they've had no previous exposure to them, and do need some grounding in the mindset of it, practical examples of how to execute the ideas are scant, and needed to be beefed up considerably in this book. Practical examples abound in other books, including the ones I mentioned above. We are living in a society, and a time, when we have ceased to learn by theory, memorization, or by simple telling. Sad but true. Experiential learning-by-doing, coupled with analysis, extrapolation, simulation, and performance testing etc., are the only *measurably* successful methods of adult learning in use today. Children learn differently than adults do. It is much more difficult for an adult to learn by theory, or by simply being \\"told\\" something. Science is just learning that it is indeed possible for adult brains to remap pathways and make new connections, and to basically unlearn/relearn information in ways we previoiusly thought only possible for the child brain to do during various stages of active growth and development. However, the fact still remains that it is more difficult for adults to implement major changes in their lives, and to stretch the boundaries of their comfort zones without practice or measurable exercises to use. The ideas set forth here do work!! It *is* absolutely possible to implement them in your every day life and see measurable, *physical* results. I simply would have liked to see more exercises and tools than what was provided. I think this is especially critical as we move into a time of social upheaval where being on the same page together, globally, will make or break our ultimate survival. We have created, collectively, what we see around us. Those individuals who are hearing that idea for the first time through this book, and are beginning to understand how they/we physically create our world on a daily basis need more than theory and ideas to become active creators. To help them participate in creatively adapting to the paradigm shift that's required of them to fulfill their full potential and power, practical tools are essential. If you purchase this book, please don't stop reading when you put this down... keep going, and put every suggestion you find into practice in every way you can. Happy Creating.

B000TZUSOY|5.0|Ike Quebec released a string of albums for blue note (for whom he was an A&R man as well as friend to owner Alfred Lion) during the early sixties, all of which are fantastic showcases for the deepest tenor sound this side of Ben Webster.  Keeping in mind the overall greatness of the entire series of these albums the question becomes, for the Quebec fan who is looking to pick through his discography or the uninitiated looking for a place to start, what setting would you prefer to hear him in? If you like the organ-combo backing go with [[ASIN:B0007DBJ78 Heavy Soul]] and it's companion [[ASIN:B000GPI1A0 It Might as Well Be Spring]].  If you prefer a more conventional setting, though done so well as to make it unconventional, than hear Ike shine on the awe-inspiring [[ASIN:B000025ADP Easy Living]] where Quebec shares the stage on some tracks with Stanley Turrentine and Bennie Green, and is backed up by Art Blakey and Sonny Clark.  If it's shortish tracks and goodtime blowing you're in the mood for go with the excellent [[ASIN:B000B66PS4 Complete Blue Note 45 Sessions]] .  But if it's space in which to hear Quebec roam you seek, and that relaxed but vital romanticism that snaked it's way from his tenor, full of reflective passion and hard-living wisdom embedded in the spite and grease, than you have two options.  One is his acknowledged masterpiece:  [[ASIN:B000005HCB Blue and Sentimental]] , and the other is his last album, an odd take on the bossa nova craze that Stan Getz helped to popularize: \\"Soul Samba\\".  Despite the virtues of the wildly popular albums that Stan Getz did ([[ASIN:B0000047CX Getz/Gilberto]], [[ASIN:B0000047CW Jazz Samba]])  \\"Soul Samba\\" is an entirely different bag.  So much so that I would warn bossa nova fans away from this album, this one is firmly grounded in Jazz with a capital \\"J\\".  Unlike Stan Getz, who sublimated himself to the overall ambiance of his bossa nova albums, Quebec and his tenor are front and center on \\"Soul Samba\\", so much so that I sometimes have to make a conscious effort to listen to what the other musicians are doing here (with the exception of Kenny Burrell who makes himself felt through out).  The other big difference between the two albums is whereas the first was noticibly lacking in anything resembling the blues, this album is drowning in it.  Every note Quebec plays is so thick with it that could you reach out into the air and cut one it would bleed a heavy blue.  This is a laid back album and it's greatest virtue is that it showcases The Sound that only Ike could coax from the tenor, that gravel-voiced wonderful sound. Think of it as vintage Quebec blue note in the tint of a relaxed Brazilian glow. It might have been an attempt to popularize Quebec on the back of the bossa nova craze of the time, but it wouldn't have mattered as Ike would die a short three months later from cancer.  If he was feeling the effects of his illness here it really doesn't show, or maybe it does in the voice of his tenor, but if that's the case then Mr. Quebec wanted to go out on top with a warm life-affirming romantic note.  Highly recommended.hat I sometimes have to make a conscious effort to listen to what the other musicians are doing here (with the exception of Kenny Burrell who makes himself felt through out).

B000BTJDGC|4.0|An agnostic lawyer defends a parish priest accused of negligent homicide during the exorcism of a college student. He warns her that the demonic forces who attacked him and Emily Rose will also attack her, which they eventually do.    But the lawyer is also bewitched by an excellent prosecutor, who calls forth one credible medical witness after another to demonstrate that the medicine that the priest dissuaded her from taking could have saved her life.    The movie is like watching a typical 21st century prime time legal show, except the story is told from the perspective of the defense. I should say that Jennifer Carpenter does a great job of playing the stricken Emily Rose. Her scenes of suffering are truly scary, and the film does a good job of portraying the supernatural from a Catholic perspective.    The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a good Friday night thriller to pop into the dvd deck while curled up on the couch with a bowl of popcorn. But if you are not into Law and Order or Crime scene shows, you probably won't like this one, either.
B000R4SMD6|4.0|This is a very smart movie.  I really enjoyed it (although some parts moved too slow).  Anthony Hopkins is as on top as ever and he really delivered a great performance.  Ryan Gosling also did a fantastic job and was very believable as a district attorney out to prove Hopkins guilty of shooting his wife.  I found this gripping and engrossing and there were enough surprises in it to keep me guessing.  While there was one or two predictable parts, the ending was great and I like the fact that we were left to do a little bit of wondering.  I don't know that it's the kind of movie to go out and buy to watch over and over, but as a first time viewing and maybe once more after you've pieced it all together, I really recommend you at least see this once.  Very entertaining.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|I had nearly worn my tape to nothing with this movie. I just love it but the DVD is a thousand times clearer. I see things that were completely missed with the tape. You can see what princess aura is barely wearing. And I do mean BARELY wearing. The detail is fabulous.   I like this movie. A bit corny but if you liked the old Flash Gordon comics you will love this movie.
B00005JM8V|5.0|I give Shoah an unhesitating five stars for all the reasons others have eloquently said.  It is a completely unique, immediate and human, tasteful and awful account of the singular episode of modern history that -- more than any other, I believe, for Jews and non-Jews alike -- informs the moral sensibilities of Western people.<br /><br />That being said, I must admit that the viewer could use a bit of extra help here and there, and I would be happy to buy a companion book with a few maps, photos and brief bios of the principles seen in the film, an outline of the film, and a brief, almanac-style guide to the Holocaust.  This thing is, after all, nine hours long.<br /><br />The languages, for one thing, were distracting to me.  Not DEtracting but DIStracting.  I enjoyed them, especially the French, which I could not stop myself from listening closely to.  That is a bit of a problem, because my French is not so good so I was rather busy trying to understand the French while I also read the English to keep up with events.  Meantime, the flow of the film is always jumping around.  And this is the kind of material that wants to be drunk in deeply rather than with a sense of scampering to take it all in.  Of course, one can watch it more than once -- and I have -- but this is not quite as practical a solution as it is for a film of 110 minutes.<br /><br />And to add to all of this, the DVD does not fully support the navigational features of my PC software, the very popular CyberLink PowerDVD.  So I can not hit a key to jump backwards or forwards a few seconds at each tap, nor can I move backwards and forwards through the DVD with the slider.  (One sees these limitations sometimes in \\"classic\\" films, but I would think it could be readily remediated in any future edition, and should be.)<br /><br />So I'd love to have a little help with this film.  Nonetheless, it is an amazing and invaluable resource even as it stands.

B0002OERI0|5.0|There was a step forward in artistic value between Nimrod and Warning. You might say the band was maturing in their music writing at that point. Now there has been another big step forward in expanding their horizons artistically.  American Idiot is to Green Day what Tommy is to the Who or better yet, what 2112 is to Rush.  I love every song on this album.  The lyrics and music writing is superb.  I love the melodies and the tempo changes.  I am looking forward to many more great albums from this band and hope they don't burnout like many other bands suffer from.  I see Green Day maturing as a band the same way Aerosmith did over the decades.  The best is yet to come.  As for all the idiots who say Green Day has sold out, well I say pound your head against a rock and listen to the tunes in your head.  At what point does a band sell out - when they leave their parents basement?  This band has a ton of talent when it comes to music writing and I am glad they share it with many.  American Idiot is and will be a classic.  In one reveiw I read, the critic said the lyrics in American Idiot was laughable and how he enjoyed their songs about masturbation better - well, I guess he doesn't like the real thing.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|The very first review I read of the band Paramore quotes that the lead singer is going to be  next Avril Lavgeine, If the magazine refers to the band becoming popular as Avril then I Concquer but in Terms of Lyrics and Music there is no doubt that Paramore surpasses Avril lavgine's Lyrics and Variety of Music available in the Album. Paramore's Album will keep on playing on your Record over and over and you'll love it even more the second time.   The debut Song Misery Business is by far the best song on the Album along with Crushcrushcrush. You will not regret purchasing the Album.

B000AL730O|4.0|I'm a huge Macca/Beatles fan to the death, even when Paul has strayed into territory that is ... well, not so good. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this album, considering he has had some hits and misses in his illustrious career. I was also intrigued when I heard \\"Fine Line\\" on the Cadillac commercial a while back, knowing how he feels about endorsing songs for commercials and ads, etc. Favorites include Jenny Wren and especially Promise to You Girl. Some tracks are very \\"Wings-esque,\\" which is a pleasant surprise. Overall, a good album that I think McCartney fans will enjoy.

The songs, arrangements and the performances of the five Wilburys are like good wine; getting better with the time.  But the DVD was a total surprise. Excellent surprise. It doccuments a unique moment of the history of rock, showing the friendship that allows the creation of fine art.  Traveling Wilburys is essencial to any music lover.
B000FIMG68|1.0|Season One had me hooked, but Season Two was agony.  I found the suspense simplistic and contrived by merely having the characters behave stupidly in the face of danger; a very frustrating thing to watch.  And by the end of the season, not a single character retained their heroic qualities as their flashbacks and/or sadistic behavior on the island revealed less than admirable qualities for each castaway.  \\"Cast away.\\"  Now that's a good idea of what to do with this boxed set...

B000005RFQ|3.0|i don't hae any emastered CDs or anything that came after the 1983 release of the album. i was a sophmore in a catholic high school when i bought the lbum. imagine the contraversy in my house when eveyone saw the cover.  even more contraversy when i played the music. after the MOB RULES, i thought my days of being a black sabbath fan were over. the departure of ronnie james dio broke my heart. but when ian gillan was brought in, i was impressed. though i had never heard of ian gillan until this album, i became a big fan of gillan and his other band DEEP PURPLE. of course, i remained--even to this day--a die hard black sabbath fan.    i enjoyed the album-i wish i still had it-but i do not think it is their best. great bass riffs and incredible shreiking from gillan make this a worthwhile listen. i do believe, to ths day, that gillan held back on his contribution to this album because he had gone back to Deep Purple and there is where i think he put his best creative talent. as a result, this album suffered a bit.
0385733577|4.0|\\"The Alchemyst\\" is the first book in a new series called The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel. It introduces us to the twins Sophie and Josh Newman who are destined to be the deciding factors in a possible war between \\"Humani\\" and the so called \\"Dark Elders\\". The elders are made up of well know figures from mythology such as Hecate, Bastet, and the Morrigan. The Dark Elders have broken away from their brethren because they have never forgiven the Humani for discovering cold iron which led to their forced retreat from the modern world. Aiding Sophie and Josh are Nicholas Flamel and his wife Perenelle. One of the things I loved about this book was the mix of mythology and factual historical figures and events. In his afterward, Michael Scott gives us the backgrounds of Nicholas and Perenelle, as well as John Dee, who were all real life figures. I have to echo one of the previous reviewers opinion that the character of Nicholas seemed much more ineffectual than you would think, given that he is a centuries old Alchemyst and magician. Other than that though, I thought the writing was excellent and I loved the other characters, especially the twins. Although Sophie and Josh are fraternal twins, they still share a special bond forged from the many absences of their archeologist parents. They react to their world being turned upside down with a heart tugging mix of courage and vulnerability. The book also gives gives us a tantalizing glimpse into the forthcoming sequel, \\"The Magician\\". I look forward to it's release.
0312983867|5.0|I love the Stephanie Plum series of novels. I really hate reading so I purchase them both in audio for me and paperback for houseguests and friends. I'm drawn in with the excitment and adventure of the story that Janet seems to capture in every novel. It has twists, turns, Lula, mystery, wonder, and of course two very \\"HOT\\" men! Who wouldn't want a mix of both men. :} I would recommend the \\"Plum\\" series, her \\"Full\\" series, as well as her earlier novels of mixed titles. They're all great fun and keep you as a reader at the edge of your seat waiting to see if a cars going to get blown up, who's died this week, who attends the pot roast dinner, who she sleeps with next, what will burn down next, and will she get her man (love or bounty). I hope you enjoy them as much as I have. I look forward to #14 in the \\"Plum\\" series, the next \\"Full\\" novel, and the new novel Janet recently wrote with a new author being released this October. Thank you!
B000055Y0X|5.0|I have been used to Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther movies but this 1964 movie is WONDERFUL! One movie..three different roles. Dr. Strangelove has stood the test of time since its release. If memory serves me correct this movie was originally to be released in late 1963 but was delayed due to the assassination of President Kennedy. George C.Scott did a superb job in his role. The scene in which the President (Peter Sellers) calling his Russian counterpart was hilarious. Worth watching again!!
B0002VKZL6|3.0|Not indicative of Mark Knopfler's capabilities, this album as a whole seems somewhat repetitive due to it's lack of variety. Nice music, but not as much fun to listen to as his work with Dire Straits.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|The Bourne Identity is one of my all-time favorite books.  I couldn't see how a movie could capture the depth and detail of Ludlum's best book.  Fortunately, they didn't try.  They took the basic premise of the book and delivered a solid action-packed thriller.  It's hard to make a good movie from a great book, but they probably did as well as could be expected taking on Ludlum in two hours.
B000RJO578|5.0|Fantastic, hilarious, unpredictable movie.  I loved it.  Wonderful cop/buddy pic.  They rocked the Zombie world with SOD.  Now they kicked some serious *ss as cops.  Buy it.  Watch it.  Laugh Out Loud Funny.
B00003CXD5|3.0|Having had good luck lately with Humphrey Bogart movies, and seeing this in looked like a good old fashioned adventure and bruised elbow movie, I thought I would check it out.    The movie starts out pretty interesting with Humphrey Bogart and his co-star playing down and out Gringos in post-revolutionary Mexico, mostly reduced to begging from other Americans and taking odd jobs (and getting taken advantage of in the process). Then they met an old prospector, and decide to go up in the mountains and look for gold.    It was at this point that I realized where this story was going, and realized I had heard this story a few times before. It's one of the oldest stories in the world: a few good men strike it rich, and then, in spite of themselves, their greed takes over and suddenly their at each other's throats. We've all heard variations of this story in many different movies, books, and fables. It is the kind of story that makes a good 15 minute Sunday School lesson for children, but stretched out over a 2 1/2 hour movie it gets old real fast.    And if it's not obvious enough to you what is going to happen, there's plenty of foreshadowing going on. The old prospector warns them ahead of time what gold does to men. Humphrey Bogart and his friend swear vehemently they will never let that happen to them which, to the viewer with any brains at all, is simply foreshadowing that they of course will become caught up in the gold craze.    From that point on the last two hours of the movie is a case of: \\"I know where this is going, now I just have to wait for it to get there\\" as the relationships among the three men slowly deteriorate after they strike it rich.    Fortunately there are a few complications thrown in along the way. For example a fourth man shows up and demands to take part in the gold digging expedition. And then all four men end up getting caught in the cross fire between the federales and the bandidos.    I didn't know it until I was watching it, but it turns out this movie is where the (slightly misquoted) famous line: \\"Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!\\" comes from. I always used to wonder what everyone was talking about when they referenced that line. Another one of life's mysteries solved.    But then the story returns to the same old children's fable about 3 men fighting among themselves because of the treasure they found.    The acting and directing in this movie is all top notch. But the story was slightly too predictable for my taste.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|This album has a lot of meaningful content, and the collaboration between these two artists is greater than the sum of the parts. While not demonstrative of Mark Knopfler's best capabilities, his playing & songwriting plays off Emmylou Harris' vocal strengths in a most agreeable fashion. Well worth adding to your shelf if you're a fan of either artist!

B00005JPFH|3.0|Based on when I saw it in theaters in May.<br /><br />\\"Spider-Man III\\" turned out to be a bigger disappointment than I thought it would be and I had somewhat high hopes for it, especially after \\"Spider-Man II\\" let me down a bit, wait make that a lot.<br /><br />I'll try not to break down a huge synopsis of the film, but it picks up where II left off, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is trying to balance life as Spidey, his job and his relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). Of course his friend Harry Osborne (James Franco) is still mad at him for killing his dad and a good action/fight sequence follows where Harry dons the new Goblin gear and attacks Peter when he's just in his regular clothes. Some good, no great special effects and sprinkled throughout the fight and Harry ends up bumping his head and loses his short term memory for a while, which is prolonged longer than it should've been in this overly long film.<br /><br />There's also an escaped convict (Thomas Hayden Church) who gets turned into a pile of sand that can take human form, sort of like Imhotep in \\"The Mummy\\", but this time the effects and the character, though somewhat cool seem unnecessary and no more than filler.<br /><br />There's also an alien symbiote that bonds with Peter and makes his suit a cool looking black, amplifies his power, brings out his aggressive side towards his enemies and others and makes him act like a fool around women.<br /><br />Obviously, like in the comics and cartoons, the symbiote will attach itself to Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) and become the ultra cool villain Venom and here in lies the biggest problem with the movie. By the time the symbiote dettachs itself from Peter and attachs to Brock to become Venom, the film has lost quite a bit of steam, though Venom looks cool, he's not in the film nearly enough, which was a big minus, but unfortunately I expected that to happen.<br /><br />There are some neat sequences in the movie, the aforementioned Goblin/Peter fight, a couple of the Sandman fights and the scenes with Venom, but too much of the movie is sappy and bogged down with trying to add sympathy, when it should be having a little more fun.<br /><br />One of the film's biggest problems, besides Venom's lack of screen time, is the fact that too many scenes throughout the movie feel like individual scenes and don't really have a lot of flow to them, which really detracts from what could've been a great, fun movie.<br /><br />It's still a fun movie for the most part, there's good humor (not the iced-dairy product) in some of the scenes, like almost any line or reaction by J.K. Simmons who plays Jameson, loved when he walked in on his secretary and Peter flirting and he says \\"Ms. Yates, that's not the position I hired you for\\". I also enjoyed Bruce Campbell's appearance as the Matre'd at a French Restaurant, very funny stuff, \\"I am French\\".<br /><br />Too bad there wasn't more to the movie besides the visual effects and humor, which should be more than you need for most summer movies, but this one felt like it needed more.<br /><br />The acting wasn't too bad, actually Church did a great job creating emotion for the Sandman character, but again it started to feel sappy after a while, same goes for Harry as the Goblin. A lot of the acting was not that good either and again the scenes seemed separate from each other, no real flow.<br /><br />After watching the movie twice, once with my two best friends and others at a midnight show, which was fun for the crowd reactions and again a week or so later with my girlfriend, I summed up the movie with the following assessment \\"It felt too long, but rushed at the same time\\", a lethal (and not the good kind of lethal) combination.<br /><br />Not a bad movie, but no where near as good as the first and it doesn't give me as much hope as I had before of another three or possible four sequels still to come, if the rumors are true.with Venom, but too much of the movie is sappy and bogged down with trying to add sympathy, when it should be having a little more fun.

1594489505|5.0|And I thought Kite Runner was about the best that could be. This topped even that! A truly remarkable story, moving beyond words, and beautifully written. And the worst part is that it very likely is true, though it's classed as a novel.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|actually I bought the CD for the song \\"home\\" which I am sure you have heard since it was a good hit. Well that is the only song in the CD that is very slow and romantic all the other songs are from a totally diferent style that is just not what I listen to.
6304779356|5.0|The DVD was in excellant condition and received in a timely matter, I love ordering with the 'one-click order button.' Very easy, very quick!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We got the first two discs in the series from Netflix and after that we just had to buy it, our pre-schoolers think it's really great too.  Stunning look at various natural realms of our planet.  Thank you BBC.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|I've noticed that everyone wants to review the film but nobody talks about its HD muscle. After buying many HD-DVDs I will say that Batman Begins is the overal best combination of amazing picture and fire setting audio! The Dolby TruHD audio track is stunning and somehow manages to make your house sound more like a movie theater than anything else out there. 100% recommended
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Before Live Show this album gets: 4 stars (maybe 3.5)  After Live Show this album gets: 5 stars (perhaps 5.5)    This band is so good live I can't stand it. You have to see them live. Then and only then can one begin to understand the genius in Wilco.  Wilco's music is like a fine wine and WRT to sky blue sky it just gets better and better with each listen.     It may take a bit of time but give sky blue sky enough spins because it's worth it... and don't forget to see them live!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I really enjoyed the story.  It was written very well, with extremely talented actors.  Who would think there would be humor in a story about serial killers. The actors fit the parts perfectly
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|The only reason to get this rather than, or in addition to, the original release is the new bonus features - but they are worth it.  I was thrilled to find out that the DVD includes the River Tam sessions, as watching them on YouTube hardly does them justice.
B000ETQPYM|1.0|I haven't read the novel... only the main plot summary. There was a Korean movie, released almost a decade before this book was ever published, with a VERY similar storyline: newlywed couple, husband asks the wife what she wants most from him, she asks for a letter, he's never written a love letter before but tries anyways, gets a BRAIN TUMOR, passes away, and then a few days later the wife starts receiving letters from her husband... letters telling her how much he loved her. It just seems way too similar to be coincidence... I mean, he dies the EXACT SAME WAY. I'm 25 now (turning 26 in October), and I remember watching the movie when I was a sophomore or junior in highschool. It's called \\"Byun-jih\\" (Letter), if you're interested. Way to go Ahern... you, like Paolini, don't have a single original thought in your head. Nice.
0061232084|5.0|Great book.  Great format.  I listened to it on the plane.  A must read business book - goes along with reading the art of war and the prince.
