B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a Green Day fan since I was 12 years old, and back then, every other song on the radio and MTV was either Longview, Basket Case, or When I Come Around. Along with Pearl Jam's \\"Vs.\\" and Local H's \\"As Good As Dead\\", \\"Dookie\\" became a lifelong standard in my CD player. Like a lot of fans, I was left unsatisfied by the next few records: Insomniac was too monotone, Nimrod too inconsistent, Warning too mellow.  <br /> <br />Finally, the band has put it all together on American Idiot. Surrounded on all sides by talentless hack bands like Good Charlotte and Slipknot, Green Day has returned to prove they just might be the greatest band of their generation. Don't be misled by anyone who tells you this is a political album: it's all about growing up. After the obligatory catchy single starts it off, we're introduced to The Jesus of Suburbia, aka St. Jimmy. The record follows his adventure through teen angst (\\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\"), girls (\\"She's a Rebel\\" and the stunning \\"Letterbomb\\"), drugs (Give me Novacaine\\"), and everything else. The saga comes to a close with his disgraceful homecoming and the denial-ridden musings about Whatsername, the girl Jimmy falls for, and who destroys him emotionally. Maybe it's my personal empathy for the American Idiot, but never before has a rock CD painted such a vivid picture of what it's like to be young, angry, and stupid.
B000065PUE|5.0|If you like Sonic Youth, Flaming Lips, Janes Addiction, Alice in Chains, Sex Pistols, The Cure, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Local H, The Vines/Hives/White Stripes, Weezer, FooFighters, QOTSA, and Many other bands like this, than you should already own this album. As defining to the late 80's as Led Zepplin to the 60's/70's. Not the same genre of Rock, but the same impact and landmark within the music that was being made. <br />The Pixies tore through bands like Foreigner, Chicago,the Pretenders, Scorpians, and VanHalen with their unorthodox sound that was anything but the norm for that time period. Their success ruling the underworld in the late 80's paved the way from then forth for later groups afformentioned in the beginning of my posting.  <br />Advice: Buy this album and claim you either lost it and rebought it or that you have owned since an acceptable date...like 1988. <br />Pixies shred in concert if you get the opps <br />CoolPeace
B00005Y7KX|5.0|This music hall is as strong as the Victor Hugo story. Lyrics and words, scenery and choregraphy are powerful. They wonderfully express the force and the emotion of the situation and characters. The choregraphy is modern but that does not hurt because the substance of the story is still of the present day. A great show!

B0001US8FI|5.0|Simply the best martial arts film ever made!  Bruce was on fire in this film..Watch the opening sequence in which he spars with Sammo Hung..yes Sammo..a very young Sammo...Bruce was in the finest shape of his life..a quintessential fighter who demonstrates an incredible skill!  I love and own this movie and never get tired of watching it..I can only imagine where Bruce's career would have gone if he had not died at such a young age..He would have made many more fine films I'm sure!
B00005JNJ7|4.0|The ideas in this movie were so intelligent.  I actually didn't laugh as much as I thought I would because it was really quite thought-provoking. The sets were incredible...every one of them had to be specially built in miniature for the marionettes, which in part caused Parker and Stone to lament that they would never again do a puppet movie.  We are lucky they made this one.  If they had made a movie which was more in their element (animation), it probably would have flowed a little more smoothly, which was a small flaw, I thought, with Team America. <br /> <br />The celebrities who were ridiculed in this movie a) are grown-ups and can handle it and b) frankly deserved it.  Thank you, Matt and Trey, for finally letting us laugh at the Hollywood elite.  Time and time again, we have to watch them spouting whatever ignorant and badly worded agenda they have in the most inappropriate places (the Academy Awards, a daytime talk show with unsuspecting guests, etc...).  It's not merely \\"having opinions\\", as another reviewer suggested, that makes these celebrities such juicy targets.  It's the annoying and frequently obnoxious way they choose to voice their said opinions. <br /> <br />I'm a sucker for music, and the songs are well-written and darkly funny.  Even the background music perfectly underscores the action and love scenes.  It just shows how important the music is to the overall punch of any movie. <br /> <br />Make sure you support these guys!  I doubt that the Hollywood crowd will be doing much for these two, being that Parker and Stone pummeled them so thoroughly.  I will be purchasing the soundtrack and DVD, when it comes out. <br />
B000002J09|1.0|Reading Stone Coldests desire for people to burn in hell etc. ,I've always been puzzled why Led Zeppelin fans are so touchy when it comes to criticism of their band. I asked my brother who studied psychology at university and he said that insecure peope like to ally themselves to \\"big\\" things, be it pop group, political causes etc. In essence by associating themselves with the \\"big\\" thing they're compensating for their own inadequacies. And criticism sparks off a \\"guilt\\" thing and they lash out.So the more rabid the fan the smaller the...well you get the hint.
B0006213H6|2.0|Well, first off, I'd like to compliment my predecessor in his ability to dig.  I agree that Von demonstrates highly Sigur Ros' growth as a band, but in quite the opposite way.  I'll explain.  Von is actually the band's debut album (not to be nitpicky); it just hasn't been released in the States until recently.  Every time I tried to get my hands on it via an Icelandic website of sorts, I found the overseas price a bit intimidating.  Though, in my attempt to keep up with the music scene I am constantly in check to see if Sigur Ros is planning on putting out any new albums, going on tours, etc.  In my search I found out that Von was being released right here in my own home country.  Fantastic.  I finally get to hear the original work of, in my opinion, one of today's best and most brilliant bands.  I put my order in a month early.  Finally my CD arrives.  I respectfully open the package, hold it high above my head, and a perfect beam of light shines down on it from the heavens.  I put it in my CD player.  The first song has an interesting, almost medieval, feel to it.  Dead Can Dance starts echoing through my head.  As the CD progresses I am less and less enthralled by the difference I hear on the album.  I find I'm hearing more sound effects than I am music.  As the tracks dawdle on amidst sounds of people walking, children playing, etc, I wait and wait for the music to slide into place, setting the scene for an aural journey similar to that of, hm, let's say...()?  or maybe Agaetis byrjun?  I will say, however, when the members of Sigur Ros do decide to pick up their instruments they don't disappoint.  Jonsi's vocals are a bit underused perhaps, but you pick your battles. My expectations are a bit lower for a debut album, perhaps that's why I can nod and smile afterward, just don't look for an Agaetis clone here.  Look more for...noise?  ooorrr everyday sounds?  maybe...the sound of your hard-earned cash flittering away into the abyss?  There are a few gems, but theratio is a bit too small for me.  That said, lose no respect for these guys.  Like I mentioned before, the album is quite a testament to where they've come.  Presently, this quartet is contributing to the world some of the most gorgeous, climactic, and, well, perfect music it has ever heard.  However, in the case of unseasoned Sigur Ros fans, I'd recommend taking my word for it when it comes to Von.  To the others, maybe it's worth a listen.  Maybe it's better to have heard and lost than never to have heard at all...for 20 bucks.
B0002OERI0|5.0|What a great album!<br /><br />First off, let me tell that I had no intentions of buying it. I used to like Green Day back in the \\"Kerplunk\\", \\"Dookie\\" days. Each album thereafter became progressively much of the same punk-pop stuff. I never thought that Green Day was a bad band, but I became disinterested.<br /><br />So bring us to last month. I borrow the disc from my buddy to check it out. I'm not impressed with the first track (though it's grown on me since), but I continue. As soon as track 2 (the 5 part \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\") hits full effect with \\"City of the Damned\\", I'm hooked. Granted, the cord progression reminds me of some cheesy 80's song (the name I can't recall) but it still rocks (because I think I LIKED the cheesy 80's song).<br /><br />Then I hit track five, \\"Are We the Waiting\\". It's such an awesome song! The chorus is like a musical march and is truly an anthem that makes you want to stand up and do...something. Other great songs include, \\"Extraordinary Girl\\", \\"When September Ends\\" and the last 5 part song, \\"The Death of St. Jimmy\\". \\"We're Coming Home\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" are the best sections on track 12.<br /><br />I think this is a great album that will definitely reignite interest for old Green Day fans that have longed for something new.
B00004R99F|5.0|all i can say is that this is the best movie ever and every time i watch it the movie gets better and better. u never lose interest and never get bored watching this film one of the best purchases i have ever made.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|....some character development that was originally trimmed to get a PG-13 rating and speed things up a bit for the theatrical release. I have heard that the final Kingpin fight is longer and much more brutal than the theatrical version. This film is very true to the recent Kevin Smith penned Daredevil comic series and it seems people either love it or hate it. The funny thing is, although it only made around 130 million in US theaters, this was one of the top selling dvd's in 2003. I prefer the darker tones in this film as well as the Blade series. The two Spider-Man movies were decent, but had no real edge at all. Daredevil has that edge and I hope the upcoming Electra movie has it also.
0679746048|4.0|<br />  In the novel eighteen-year-old Susanna Kaysen is sent away to a psychiatric hospital.  At the hospital she meets girls that are also going through psychiatric problems.  It is scary to read about the conditions the girls had to live in and how they were treated.  It is also interesting to read about the relationships and personalities of the girls with their illnesses. <br /> Susanna is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.  The book really portrays Susanna's diagnosis and explains her symptoms.  One of Susanna's symptoms is self-mutilation.  For example, she would bang her wrist on the metal part of a chair.  <br /> This book is even more fascinating because the book is based upon Susanna's own life experiences.  She explains the difference between mind and brain.  She also shows the hardships of getting a job when employers know you are from a psychiatric hospital.  I think the book questions what is to be considered \\"mentally insane\\" and \\"normal\\".  In the end Susanna describes her perception of life with a painting which she sees in a museum where a girl sits in an imperfect world. <br /> I think this book was hard to read but was interesting.  It gives you a real understanding of the life and thoughts of a person with a mental illness and the hardships that they have to endure.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I was looking forward to watching the series in DVD format with the improved picture and sound.  I was a dissapointed that instead of improving the old effects with computer generation he instead added extras that added no benefit to the story.  What really ruined it for me was the replacment of Sebastion Shaw (Anakin) with Hayden Christiansen in the final scene of Jedi.  What's next?  Will he digitize Ewen Mcgregor over Alec Guiness's scenes!  To be fair the sound is fantastic and for people who have never seen the film it is enjoyable, but it has ruined the magic of the original films!
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is the DVD collection you need not only if you are a Star Wars fan but just a movie fan. However there are changes: these are the special editions so for purists there most be some things that they wont like, but if you (like myself) enjoyed the Special Editions re-release on theaters, you will enjoy this one as well.<br /><br />Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi never looked and sound so great! With digital sound and restored film footage it looks like its all new.<br /><br />However there are small changes: on Empire the conversation between the Emperor and Vader (with Ian Mc Diarmid added when it was the holgram figure of Clive Revill speaking) is changed from the original (just the lines of the Emperor) that was a little lousy change, and also including Hayden Christensen as the spirit of Anakin at the end of 'Jedi' that was also very strange. But still those minor flaws you can enjoy a good and a classic popcorn movie. A few good changes? For example the lightsaber duel between Obi Wan and Vader on 'A New Hope' was given speed which makes thing a little Vader. The already added scene of Jabba and Han Solo was also a little bit tweaked so Jabba can match the color of the puppet on ROTJ.<br /><br />Anyway the 4th disc are the extras wich are AWESOME!! It's the best featurettes that a movie can have, specially those label as \\"Empire of Dreams\\" which is a great documentary. Also the trailers and TV Spots was a great addition.<br /><br />Get this movie, you won't regret it and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU... ON DVD!!! ALWAYS!!!
0553378384|4.0|Once again the author has done a great job of presenting her material in a way that anyone can use and get something from it.  The first part of the book guides you through the process of finding the position of your North Node V which is what this book goes into exploring. <br /> <br />If the North Node sounds a bit frightening or alien... dont worry.  Jan Spiller goes into explaining what this is, and what it means in a way that is easy to grasp. <br /> <br />There is a chapter titled How to Use This Book that explains what the North Node is as well as overviewing some definitions that are used in the book that will help you get more out of reading it.  This chapter also covers an explanation of the Nodal Axis, signs and houses, duplicate sign/house positions, and also opposing sign/house positions. <br /> <br />The rest of the book is divided into each of the twelve zodiac signs and the Nodal placement in them... e.g., North Node in Aries, North Node in Taurus, North Node in Gemini, etc.  Each of these chapters is divided further into the following subheadings: <br /> <br /> Overview <br /> Personality <br /> Needs <br /> Relationships <br /> Goals <br /> Healing Theme Song <br /> <br />The information given for each nodal position is clear and detailed.  You only need to know what sign your North Node is in to get a lot out of this book V and you have everything you need to figure that out in the first few pages of Astrology for the Soul.  Those of you with a deeper knowledge of your birth chart (i.e., house position of your North Node) will get even more out of this book. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book for the beginner. <br />
B00005QG9J|5.0|Prior to buying this album during the early summer of 2004, I didn't know jack about Incubus. I heard a few of their songs a while back and recall the song \\"Familiar\\" which they did with D.j Greyboy on the Spawn soundtrack. Brandon Boyd the lead singer has good vocals and it blends in nicely with the tunes Incubus dish out. When I first heard a few of their songs off this \\"Morning View\\" CD, I got instantly addicted and went out and bought it. The entire album is intentionally different from all their other ones, obviously that's the case with every one of their releases and that's what I like -- diversity. This album has the best summer vibe I can think of, it's one of those CDs that you can pop into your car CD player and cruise down the beach in. My favourite song is \\"Are you in?\\" because that brings such a hip, mellow \\"cool\\" vibe...I really don't know the words to describe that song. Other favourites are \\"Mexico,\\" \\"Echo,\\" \\"Wish you were here,\\" \\"Warning\\" and \\"Under my Umbrella.\\" The CD just doesn't lack the \\"rock\\" component while still managing to elevate in other experimental ranges. The only song I'd say that is mediocre is \\"Circles\\" because it comes right after the track \\"Nice to know you\\" which is an awesome opener. This is truly remarkable and has excellent replay value, pick it up!
079073804X|5.0|Keep in mind that \\"The Exorcist\\" (1973) was not only way ahead of its time but it also started the type of horror flicks we're all accustomed to today. And it was produced without the benefit of today's super-duper graphic and digital gimmicking. <br /> <br />The acting and the direction still hold up very well. As for the doubters and sarcastic disbelievers, this movie was based on a true event which took place in 20th century Baltimore. Furthermore, to doubt demonic possession without the slightest bit of research is to admit intellectual shallowness & closed-mindeness. <br /> <br />l would venture to say that the Freddie Kreuger/Michael Meyers slasher/brutality mentality has immuned so very many moviegoers to classic filmmaking. But if you're interested in a solidly produced and directed flick, enjoy this movie...and then, by all means, read the excellent book.
068987474X|5.0|One could say that this book is all common sense, but as we know, common sense is sometimes in short supply.  I loved the directness and humor in this book.  Yes, if someone is interested in you they will ACT interested.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for guys and gals alike.  It's a fun read with wisdom that you can't argue with.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Ghost in the Shell 2 is not only the best visually produced Anime ever, the questions asked are THE most relevent questions of our time.  SO MUCH SO THAT IT WILL TAKE SOMETIME FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW RLEVENT THIS MOVIE IS.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You'll like this show. Why is there slavery on Firefly? It's a cool way to show how very nasty the Alliance is. But there is the question, \\"Once slavery ends, why would it ever return again in the distant future?\\" In Russian history, serfdom ended only to return because of technological change. What kind of technological change brings back serfdom to Firefly's universe? First, a little history from economist Paul Krugman and then a quick comparison with Firefly: Serfdom in Russia wasn't an institution that dated back to the Dark Ages. Instead, it was mainly a 16th-century creation, contemporaneous with the beginning of the great Russian expansion into the Ukraine. There's no point in enslaving or enserfing a man unless the wage you would have to pay him if he was free is substantially above the cost of feeding, housing, and clothing him.    Imagine a pre-industrial society where population is pressing on limited land supplies, and the marginal product of labor - and hence the real wage rate under competitive conditions - is barely at subsistence. In that case, why bother with establishing property rights in human beings? It costs no more to hire a free worker than to feed a slave. Indeed, by 1300 - with Europe very much a Malthusian society - serfdom had withered away from lack of interest.    But now suppose that for some reason land becomes abundant [new planets terraformed], and labor scarce. Then competition among landowners will tend to push up wages of free workers, and the ruling class will try, IF ALLOWED, to pin peasants down and prevent them from bargaining for a higher standard of living. In Russia, it was all about gunpowder: suddenly steppe nomads were no longer so formidable, and the rich lands of the Ukraine were open for settlement. Serfdom was an effort to keep peasants from taking advantage of this situation. Those who were venturesome enough to run away and set up outside the system became Cossacks.    And now for the analogues between history andFirefly:   (1) Russia is the Core Worlds, industrial center of the Universe.   (2) Gunpowder is terraforming of planets and moons to make land in the Outer Worlds.   (3) Ukraine is the pre-industrial Outer Worlds; its peasants are being enslaved.   (4) Cossacks gone mad are Reavers, the scariest villains in the Universe.  In a universe ruled by money, not morals, slavery is a real possibility. And there is worse than slavery: the Alliance has a 'gray' market in human organs for transplantation. Serfs become spare parts for ailing Capitalists.     Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Fox TV network that cancelled Firefly, put two cheap \\"reality\\" video shows 'Totally Outrageous Behavior' and 'World's Craziest Videos' into Firefly's Friday night timeslot. Why does America not deport him for tastelessness? He'd own slaves if it were legal. And sell their hearts for profit. He's already sold his own.
0316666343|4.0|As I closed the cover, reciting the last line in my head, and the realization that I had finished this riveting book came over me, I had a sudden feeling of emptiness. I felt as though in the pit of my stomach there was a whole, and I realized the impact that this book had on me. Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold, was an remarkable, beautiful, and touching novel. Her style and creativity captures you as a reader. The plot and the pain of this book was so real and done in such detail that you, yourself feel as though you are a character in the book. The part of the book that is so interesting and mind blowing is in the beginning how Alice has portrayed heaven. Usually you are left with the clich idea of heaven being full of clouds, and people or angels flying around with white robes and wings. However, in this novel the author has altered heaven, and perceives it as a large playground. Where anything you want can come true, and you're surrounded by other children just like yourself.  <br />  <br />      The novel begins in horror, with the rape and murder of Susie Salmon, the protagonist of the story. As a 14-year-old Susie, is brutally murdered at the hands of a neighbor who, unknowingly to the residents of her Northeastern suburb, is a serial killer. Susie herself narrates the story, from her place in her own personalized version of heaven; it looks like exactly the high school she had always dreamed of attending, and all the textbooks are just fashion magazines. She also has a friendly roommate, an \\"intake counselor\\" or a former social worker whose reward is to finally be appreciated for it. They're lots of dogs to play with and a gazebo where she can watch her family, friends and murderer go on with their lives.   <br />  <br />      I, myself am not a reader but I honestly could not put this book down. I went through such an emotional roller coaster, from dealing with the pain the family must have been going through with heir teenage daughter brutally murdered. Then there were three things this book will do; it will make you feel sadness, suspense, and faith. Sadness because the raped is written very detailed, it is very graphic. Then suspense, because all through the book you're wondering is the neighbor going to get caught, will her murder be redeemed. Lastly, Faith, because it leaves you with the sense that life goes on, and that your love ones do go to a better place. In conclusion Lovely Bones was one of the best books I have every read, and the author did a superb job with writing this book and I recommend to anyone mature enough. <br />
B0002TSZK6|1.0|George W. Bush is not a great president; in fact, he is a major expansionist who will likely blow up the federal deficit into the tens of trillions, especially now that he has won a second term.  Part of the reason that Bush has not been effectively defeated is that his opponents have become too unhinged, just as many prominent Republicans seemed to lose their sanity during the Clinton years.  In politics, it is often not that one side clearly prevails, but that the other side, due to its own excesses, manages to completely alienate a majority of the American electorate.  What we have seen since the 2000 election is the rise of several rabid leftists -- George Soros, the wackos in Hollywood, etc. -- who foam at the mouth and generally make complete asses of themselves while attempting to discredit the president.  Michael Moore may be the best example of this collection of hotheads and malcontents.  Many observers have voiced their outrage at Moore's antics; people like me, however, realize the man for what he is: a pompous fool who does more harm to his causes than any Republican ever could.  Rather than rail against this filmmaker, Bush loyalists should offer to subsidize his next feature film.    Moore's latest offering, the amazingly dishonest FAHRENHEIT 9/11, may be his most ridiculous project to date.  The same idiot who told us that terrorism was not a problem has now made an entire film excoriating the Bush Administration for not going after Osama Bin Laden.  As usual, the filmmaker has presented a number of themes, many of which completely contradict each other (BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was even more notorious in its dreadful lack of consistency).  At one point in the movie, Moore implies that the American troops in Iraq are cold-hearted neandrathals who derive great pleasure from torturing and murdering innocent civilians.  Later he feigns sympathy for those serving in the armed services, portraying them as a bunch of poor kids who had few options in life butto join the military (and thus, Moore also plays the standard class warfare game).  Again, consistency has never been a staple of this man's work.              Much of the rest of this shoddy picture is nothing more than a tribute to manipulative film splicing.  Any hack with the proper equipment can edit footage in such a way as to make even the most intelligent person look like a buffoon.  Moore is a master at this.  Such sophomoric tactics are most fully on display near the beginning of the film.  There is a whole sequence that features muted footage of various members of the Bush Administration, including the commander in chief himself, primping themselves just before going on camera.  In one shot, Paul Wolfowitz, that hated Neocon and Zionist, licks his hand and then uses it to fix his hair.  If Moore expects his viewers to laugh at such silly cheap shots, he has even less respect for the audience than I originally assumed.  There are plenty of valid ways to oppose the current cadre that controls the White House; unfortunately, none of these ways are explored in this shameful attempt at discourse.    Most of FAHRENHEIT is either comically false or mildly irritating.  However, some of the film is beyond merely obnoxious.  In one of the most outrageous scenes in the movie, we are treated to images of pre-war Iraq, which is (surprise!  surprise!) a blissful utopia where carefree children fly kites and elderly women sit on their porches soaking up the joyous atmosphere.  Sympathy for tyrannical dictators -- in this case, Mr. Hussein -- has always been a characteristic of the left.  Moore has taken this bias to a whole new level of sophistry.  Wicked regimes that murder their own people in the millions are never as nefarious as capitalist America's vicious imperialism.  The filmmaker also spends much time exploiting the sorrow of a woman who has lost a son in Iraq.  The ironic thing is that the woman strongly encouraged each of her male family members to join the military.  One can easily sympathize with her pain, but shouldn't a person know that those who join the armed services are taking the risk of dying in battle, whether just or unjust?  Having witnessed Moore's attempt to milk this poor woman's grief for all its worth, the average viewer may be more enraged at the filmmaker's grotesque behavior than saddened by the tragedy of a young man's untimely death.     Like all Moore pictures, FAHRENHEIT is a manipulative piece of propaganda that a certain, feeble-minded percentage of the public will undoubtedly buy hook, line, and sinker.  What is actually in the movie is not nearly as ominous as its fairly impressive popularity: the debate in the nation is increasingly being hijacked by duplicitous self promoters and clownish bunko artists.  The snobbery and self-righteousness of the left have finally caught up with them.  While many of the right's most prominent figures have sacrificed their traditional principles of limited government in order to support a president who constantly seeks to expand federal power,  the narcissism of America's statist liberals have rendered conservative hypocrisy insignificant.  We have truly reached the point where the inmates are running the asylum.  That Moore is a mainstream figure in today's media world speaks volumes about our current state of affairs.
0440237688|4.0|This book is on my listmainia list of dystopias, because it does show a society gone in a different, and unpleasant, direction.  It stands out on that list because, unlike other dystopias, this one requires a few elements borrowed from fantasy literature to make possible the relationship between the Giver and the Receiver. <br /> <br />Perhaps if that had been worked differently, this would have gone from four to five stars. <br /> <br />As a dystopia, this is one of the rare \\"female\\" dystopias.  A male dystopia shows how each person plugs into the society and how it impacts the family.  A female dystopia concentrates more on the family relationships and how they support society.  The two are similar but not the same.  This makes a good read for the reason of a refreshing perspective. <br /> <br />Even though this is considered \\"adolescent literature\\", it was well written enough for an adult to enjoy.  That's also quite a good thing, so parents can share this with their children.

0142000663|5.0|\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" tells the story of the Joad family, small tenant-farmers from Oklahoma, who lose their home and livelihood to the twin disasters of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Like many others in a similar situation, they spend their meagre savings on the purchase of an old car to take them to California, which they believe to be a land of plenty and opportunity where they will be able to make a good living as agricultural workers. When they arrive there, however, they find that they have been misled. California, its population swelled by thousands of migrant workers from other parts of America, already has a surplus of labour. Unemployment is therefore high, work difficult to find, wages low even when any work is to be found, and decent accommodation unavailable.<br /><br />The novel tells the story of a journey, and there are echoes of two other well-known stories about journeys; the Biblical book of Exodus and the true historical story of the nineteenth century American pioneers who opened up the West. Like their ancestors, the Okies, as the migrant workers become known, travel westwards in search of a better life. Like the Children of Israel, they journey out of what they perceive as a land of bondage towards what they see as a Promised Land. There are other echoes of the Bible in the book. The very title \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is taken from a line in The Battle Hymn of the Republic, a poem which uses Biblical language and imagery to convey America's vision of itself as a land of freedom. Several of the Joad family have Christian names taken from the Old Testament (Noah, Ruth, Rose of Sharon). Their friend Jim Casy, a former preacher who has started to doubt his former religious beliefs, nevertheless takes on an increasingly prophetic role as the story progresses. (He significantly has the same initials as Jesus Christ).<br /><br />In the Bible, of course, the Children of Israel did indeed reach the Promised Land after years of wandering in the wilderness, and many of the pioneers, despite dangers and hardship, did succeed in making better lives for themselves. In the novel, there is no such happy ending for the Joads or for the others who travel the same route. Steinbeck alternates between longer chapters, narrating the story of the Joads themselves, and shorter ones commenting on the general situation of the Okies. These shorter chapters are often used as vehicles for the author's left-wing political opinions, as he attacks the various individuals and corporations who have contributed to the plight of the dispossessed. The banks and landlords, in their desire for profit, force the tenant farmers off their land. The big Californian landowners lure them with misleading advertising promising abundant well-paid work, hoping to create a labour surplus and thereby keep wages down. The motor dealers exploit their desperation to get to California by selling them overpriced, unroadworthy vehicles, which they can only afford by selling off their few remaining possessions. When they try to dispose of these, however, they find that the dealers in second-hand goods are not prepared to offer anything other than rock-bottom prices. In California itself, the agricultural employers try to keep wages as low as possible, and vigorously resist, aided by a brutal police force, any attempts on the part of their workers to form unions or to combine to raise wages. Neither the State authorities nor the ordinary people of California welcome the newcomers in their midst, seeing them as a threat to either public order or to their living standards. The result is that the Okies lead a life of great hardship, living in squalid accommodation, desperately seeking work, however low-paid, in order to keep themselves from starving.<br /><br />As I said, there is no happy ending for the Joads, or even a hopeful one. Indeed, there is not even an unhappy or tragic resolution to their situation. The final image of the novelis the striking one Rose of Sharon using her breast milk, after giving birth to stillborn child, to feed a dying man. There is, however, no definite conclusion to the story of the family as a whole. We do not hear what becomes of Noah, who leaves the family shortly after their arrival in California, or of his brother Tom, who has gone on the run after killing a man, or of Rose of Sharon's husband, who has abandoned her. This lack of a definite ending is not, in my view, a fault. In other works of fiction, such as \\"The Pearl\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men\\", Steinbeck showed that he was well able to write logical, satisfying endings to stories when need be. His failure to provide such an ending to the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" was quite deliberate. There is no conclusion to the story of the Joads because there is no conclusion to the story of the Okies. Their tomorrow will be the same as their today; a desperate struggle for the basic necessities of life.<br /><br />In some ways- his indignation, his social concerns and in the clarity of his prose- Steinbeck reminds me of his British contemporary George Orwell. Certain passages struck me as particularly fine pieces of descriptive or polemical writing- notably the opening chapter, which describes the harsh drought which led to the creation of the Dust Bowl, and Chapter 25, in which the author contrasts the beauty and fruitfulness of the California landscape with the inhumanity of the big landowners, wilfully destroying their produce to keep prices high while other men go hungry.<br /><br />Criticisms have been made that not all economic migrants to California during the thirties suffered the same hardships as the Joads and that many of them actually did manage to find well-paid work and to raise their standards of living. It has also been claimed that not all Californians were as unwelcoming or hostile to the newcomers as those shown in the book. There may be some truth in these claims, but to dismiss the book on these grounds is no more reasonable than to refuse to read Dickens on the grounds that not all Victorian boarding-schools were as bad as Dotheboys Hall and not all factory owners as stony-hearted as Mr Bounderby. There can be no denying that the Depression was a time of poverty and hardship for many, and Steinbeck's novel is possibly the most powerful and memorable fictional evocation of that era. Its place as one of the classics of twentieth-century American literature is a deserved one.of the novel is the striking one Rose of Sharon using her breast milk, after giving birth to stillborn child, to feed a dying man.

B00005JKTF|3.0|Cate Blanchett is too good of an actress for the title role in \\"Charlotte Gray.\\"  I liked her performance, but the film did not really click for me because too many of the characters do too many stupid things.  In the context of this story these stupid things matter because most of the film takes place in Vichy France where stupid things can get you killed.  Adapted from Sebastian Faulks' novel by screenwriter Jeremy Brock, \\"Charlotte Gray\\" is about a Scottish woman who is doing what she can for King and Country during World War II.  Because she can speak fluent French, this means working on radio communications with the French Resistance movement.  But we get the feeling that she wants to do more, and certainly we think that she is capable of doing more; after all, this is Cate Blanchett.<br /><br />Then one evening at a party Charlotte meets Peter (Rupert Penry-Jones), a young airman.  Apparently they fall in love.  This matter is in doubt somewhat because they spend one passionate night together and when he gets shot down over France, Charlotte she decides to join British Special Operations, be trained to be a special agent, and dropped into France in the general vicinity of where Peter is supposed to be hiding with the Resistance.  It is certainly fortunate that Charlotte is sent by her King and Country to where she wants to go, but it is the impulsive decision to go through all that training that bothers me.  The French Resistance would be trying to get Peter home, so that it is not like Charlotte should be expecting him stay in one place until she shows up to rescue him.  What Charlotte is doing would be like finding out that a loved one has a medical problem and then rushing off to medical school to become a doctor so that you can save their life.  There has to be an easier way.<br /><br />But that actually does not matter because once Charlotte makes contact with the Resistance group she has a whole new set of problems.  The leader of the group is Julien Levade (Billy Crudup), who happens to be a Communist.  Charlotte's cover as \\"Dominique\\" is that she has fled Paris and is working for Julien's father (Michael Gambon).  There is a mission to blow up a train that Dominique gets to go along for absolutely no reason that I can think of given that her single talent is that she speaks French (well, and English).<br /><br />Then we have the moment where the bubble bursts.  Nazis march into the provincial French town and Julien stands up and starts screaming curses and the names of citizens who had been killed by the Germans and/or their French collaborators.  Dominique finds another talent useful for shutting Julien up, but even over the noise of the tanks the Nazis (and/or their French collaborators), should have spotted the angry French guy and taken out a Luger to shut him up.  But this is a film where the hero is betrayed by one of those collaborators not because he is the Nazi hating communist who leads the French Resistance in that neck of the woods but because it is seen as a way of forcing Dominique to submit sexually.<br /><br />Charlotte might have come to France for Peter but for Dominique the big concern is a pair of young Jewish boys whose parents have already been sent away to a \\"work\\" camp.  The boys are hiding with Levade's father and since Dominique is a woman she is put in charge of them, which basically means trying to keep anybody from discovering them.  This, more than finding Peter or resisting the Nazis, becomes her mission and it appears to be the hardest one of all.  The most memorable moment in \\"Charlotte Gray\\" concerns the one small victory that she can manage in the overwhelming situation in which she finds herself.<br /><br />There are three parts to the ending of this film, and what they underscore is what we suspected all along.  That Charlotte Gray really was in way over her head when she redirected her life.  In fact, if this film had ended with Dominique still in France, I would have had a higher opinion of it.  Instead, the point is muddled by making a point of finding out what happened to the film's unstated love triangle.  I can see how both Blanchette and director Gillian Armstrong would see the character of Charlotte Gray as being a stronger one than we usually find in World War II movies, but they still should have seen her problematic elements as well and have had them rectified before making this movie.  The performances by the principles are quite good, but they do not make up for the flaws in the story.have had a higher opinion of it.

B0000506TD|5.0|After a couple of albums that were more noted for hit singles that smacked too much of pop music for their fans, namely 1968's \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" with \\"Hello, I Love You\\" and 1969's \\"The Soft Parade\\" with \\"Touch Me,\\" the Doors got back to their roots with \\"Morrison Hotel.\\" This is clear from the opening track on this 1970 album, the rock 'n' booze anthem \\"Roadhouse Blues,\\" which blasts this album into the stratosphere. Robbie Krieger's opening riff sets the tone and Ray Manzarek pounds away on the piano to establish the mood, with the whole thing capped off by Jim Morrison's vocalized howls. You can hear live versions of \\"Roadhouse Blues,\\" but unfortunately none of them were ever performed in the perfect locale, which would have been a bar. But you can imagine how great it would sound to hear this one blasting the top off of some juke joint.<br /><br />There are not any hit singles on the group's fifth studio album, which is undoubtedly why it went over better with the fans of the Doors, even if it only made it to #4 on the Billboard album charts. To help validate the blues the Doors brought in the great sessions jazz guitarist Ray Neopolitan, albeit as a bass player (the Doors never really bothered with one). The requisite touch of the exotic can be found in songs like \\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" \\"Queen of the Highway,\\" and \\"Indian Summer.\\" Morrison, who was noticeably disengaged in terms of both his lyrics and his singing on previous albums, is back to waxing poetic big time, as evidenced by \\"Ship of Fools,\\" which mixes nihilistic imagery with prospects for hope. Again, Morrison is found commenting on the counterculture, singing about how \\"Everyone was hanging out/Hanging up and hanging down/Hanging in and holding fast.\\" Musically the instrumental break is where the group gets to indulge in some showmanship where the emphasis is decidedly on jazz and no longer on pop.<br /><br />The other great track is \\"Peace Frog,\\" which comments on the \\"Blood in the streets,\\" but is more notable for Morrison's musings on an episode from his childhood in some of his most searing imagery (e.g., \\"Indians scattered on dawn's highway, bleeding to death\\") and poetic (e.g., \\"Blood is the rose of mysterious union\\"). Again, Krieger and Manzarek provide the appropriate musical accompaniment to the verbal images of cultural unrest as the end of the turbulent Sixties being thrown out by Morrison. The Doors often commented on what was happening in the streets without ever offering a solution, and this song is one of their best efforts in that regard. One final track of note remains, and that would be the slow blues tune \\"The Spy,\\" simply because its music, if not its lyrics (e.g., \\"I know the word that you long to hear/I know your deepest, secret fear\\"), anticipates the last great Doors song to come on their final album, \\"L.A. Woman.\\",\\" but is more notable for Morrison's musings on an episode from his childhood in some of his most searing imagery (e.g., \\"Indians scattered on dawn's highway, bleeding to death\\") and poetic (e.g., \\"Blood is the rose of mysterious union\\").

B000002A46|5.0|After the astounding success of her diamond-certified third studio album Music Box, Mariah Carey actually took the time to record a holiday album just for her fans. Ain't that sweet? I'm sure everyone enjoyed this album as much as I do. It contained christmas classics as well as new songs.  <br /> <br />Mariah always record classics and made it her own. She sounded totally breathtaking on songs like Silent Night, O Holy Night (this is the best track on this album! All other renditions by other singers are simply sub-par and mediocre), All I Want For Xmas Is You (Mariah's own classic!), Miss You Most and Christmas (Baby Please Come Home). This album even reached 4 times platinum stateside. <br /> <br />This is a must for all Mariah fans and for those who love Christmas tunes. Its one of the best holiday albums I've heard in a while.
B0000549B0|5.0|\\"Well, I've wrestled with reality for 35 years, doctor, and I'm happy to state I finally won out over it.\\" That cheerful comment sets the tone for \\"Harvey,\\" a movie about a lovable guy whose way of dealing with the harshness of reality is simple: Make his own.<br /><br />Veta Louise Simmons (Josephine Hull) hopes to arrange a wonderful marriage for daughter Myrtle May (Victoria Horne) in the upper echelons of society. There's one problem: her wealthy brother Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) has an imaginary pal, a six-foot-three rabbit called Harvey. After Elwood accidently wrecks a party by introducing Harvey to everyone, Veta decides to have him committed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when Veta takes Elwood to the sanatorium, the staff come to think that the fluttery socialite is crazy, and is trying to get her sunny brother out of the way. So they lock her up, and let him go. After that mistake is straightened out, the psychiatric staff and Elwood's long-suffering family try to find him.... and Harvey.<br /><br />If we ever saw Elwood P. Dowd (\\"Here, let me give you one of my cards\\") in a car, the bumper sticker would probably say, \\"Reality is highly overrated.\\" The big theme of the movie is that reality can be harsh, and that it's not necessarily a bad thing to lapse out of it into the fantasies of our own minds. If Elwood isn't dangerous and is otherwise normal, who cares if he has an imaginary friend?<br /><br />Is Harvey real? The film leaves that up to our imaginations. And in the end, it doesn't matter if Harvey is a figment of Elwood's imagination, or a friendly spirit. It's the effect he has on Elwood that is important. His presence makes Elwood happy and relaxed, and Elwood makes others happy and relaxed -- even the hard-boiled head of the psychiatric ward, who lies down on his own couch and tells his secrets to Elwood.<br /><br />This actually isn't too screwballish a comedy -- sure, there's the running joke where Elwood politely introduces Harvey to people he meets. And the scene where Veta is committed is hilarious. But it's more of a heartwarmer than a comedy, from Elwood softening the lead shrink to Myrtle May finding love with a lovable blue-collar worker from the sanatorium.<br /><br />James Stewart gives a wonderfully dreamy performance, slightly smelling of booze and flowers -- his Elwood P. Dowd is mild-mannered, sweet, gallant, courteous, and oh-so-pleasant. And he's learned the value of just enjoying the little things in life, like a flower, a beer or a talk with a friend. And Josephine Hull brings up a brilliant performance as his frazzled sister, with several other good actors rounding off the supporting cast.<br /><br />Who is crazier -- the happy man with the imaginary rabbit, or the people who want him to be 100% sane and less happy? You make the call. With a sweet, surreal story and a flawless cast \\"Harvey\\" is one of those rare movies that does an unspecifiable number on your heartstrings.to people he meets.

0684833395|5.0|I had a friend who didn't like this book because she took it way too seriously.  Don't follow her lead, follow mine and the rest of the free world's, we know what we're talking about.  If you lighten up and prepare yourself for a very funny satire, you're in for the literary treat of your life.  Heller makes so much sense when he pokes fun, and the situations he puts his characters in are ludicrously funny and outrageous.  If you find yourself asking questions like, \\"How could there be a person named Major Major Major?\\" or waking up at 2am in a sweaty rage, catatonically screaming, \\"It's inhumane for Colonel Scheisskopf to want to bolt his soldier's arms to their legs to make them march straighter!\\", and yes, Scheisskopf DOES mean what you think it means, then you may have this book mistaken with Heller's other famous piece, \\"Absolute True Facts About World War II and the Heroic Soldier's Related\\"*.  Catch 22 is a satire and is very funny if you let it be so go out and get a couple of copies (I recommend buying eight), go get comfortable in your laughing chair, and...jump! <br />*Only sold in Haiti.
B000001DTM|5.0|From the opening clangor of \\"Zoo Station\\" - an irresistable mix of echoed guitars, metallic crashes, layered effects and a driving, gotta-dance beat, U2 makes it clear that the eighties, and the band it had been then, are over. ACHTUNG BABY was the birth of a new U2, the result of three and a half years' work which the listener can hear in every perfectly-placed chord. There's really not much to say about this album, as it's just so damned good, but I'll try.     Relinquishing the Americana which had served U2 so well on THE JOSHUA TREE - and so unsuccessfully on RATTLE AND HUM - in favor of a pan-European style and sensibility, ACHTUNG BABY blends a sharp rock attack with dancefloor rhythms and experimental touches which reward both close and casual listening. \\"Zoo Station\\" sets the tone with its huge, fully realized soundstage and constantly disorienting filtration of vocals and guitars. \\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\\" is a driving love song that's impossible to get out of your head - as indeed is most of the album. \\"One,\\" perhaps ACHTUNG BABY's most popular track, is U2's supreme ballad, a tear-jerking performance particularly distinguished by its lyrics (\\"You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl\\" has to be the greatest love line I've ever heard). Bono's growth as a lyricist is phenomenal throughout ACHTUNG BABY, and is as crucial an element in the album's success as the band's tight new instrumental approach. Once rock's most elliptical lyricist, then its most bombastic, U2's frontman and philosophical lynchpin here emerges as a singularly precise observer of the frustrated relationships which serve as this album's primary theme. \\"Until the End of the World\\" is a mammoth rocker, dark yet danceable, with still more killer lines (\\"In a dream I was drowning my sorrows, but my sorrows, they learned to swim\\") and a simple but effective guitar solo - one of several on ACHTUNG BABY, which is another nice surprise - from the Edge. \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your WildHorses,\\" as the title suggests, is pure poetry, a lost love ballad torn between remorse and courage, and finding solace in neither. Slowing things down a bit, the haunting \\"So Cruel\\" keeps with the theme of doomed romance (No political rants from the new U2!), this time setting it to a hypnotic walking beat.     \\"The Fly\\" was, of course, Bono's adopted persona on this album and its subsequent tour; but it's also a very effective track in its own right, opening with a relentless attack of phased and delayed guitars before the hissing vocal sets in with a bitter catalogue of life's woes that, in the end, turns out to have been a call on a public telephone. It's worth noting here that the presence of all three of U2's major 1980s producers - Steve Lillywhite, Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois - is a big part of ACHTUNG BABY's appeal; not surprisingly, the album is a gold mine of sonic details, such as the dead-on percussion underpinning \\"Mysterious Ways,\\" a flawless pop-rocker by any standard and the closest thing to an upbeat story we get here. \\"Trying to Throw Your Arms Around the World\\" is one of the few numbers on ACHTUNG BABY which might have fit on an eighties U2 album: slow and dreamy, it recalls some of the lesser-known tracks of the JOSHUA TREE era, though with a bit more electronic overlay. \\"Ultra Violet\\" is another powerhouse, with biting guitars and top-notch singing. I should mention the vital contributions of Adam Clayton on bass and Larry Mullen on drums to every song listed here, as well, though that's probably not necessary as U2's rhythm section is, quite justly, one of the most celebrated in rock music. \\"Acrobat\\" takes things to a dark and sinister place before the closer, \\"Love Is Blindness,\\" drives ACHTUNG BABY's message home one final time in an almost cathartically dreamy, resigned rumination on the futility of love in a loveless world.     ACHTUNG BABY reinvented U2, and set a standard for powerful, rhythmically charged music which was equal parts rock, pop, world and electronica. I unhesitatingly call it the band's best album, the nineties' best album and one of the four or five greatest rock discs of all time. Grab it, and get grabbed in return.
068987474X|5.0|I agree with the reviewers who say that this is all common sense.  It is.  There seem to be two main points that can be distilled from the this book, neither or which strike me as rocket science.      1)  People (men and women) will move heaven and earth to make quality time for people they want to be with.  That doesn't only include romantic interests, but friends, family, etc.  If someone consistently isn't willing to do that (anyone can have a bad day), especially in the early stages of a relationship, move on.  They aren't interested.       2)  Most people do not want to hurt other people needlessly, so it makes sense that most of us (again, I would include both men and women here) would hope someone would conclude that the silence of a non-ringing phone indicates a deafening lack of interest, as opposed to having to spell it out to this person in plain English that you're just not feeling it.       Interestingly, in regards to the latter point, I disagree with the authors that not calling suggests cowardice on the part of the man.  I would say it reflects a desire to not hurt someone more than is necessary.  This assumes of course there was no real relationship between the individuals.  In that case, just disappearing is a crappy thing to do.    At any rate, I really enjoyed this book and have since purchased copies for some friends.  Even though most of us know all of this stuff on some level, when you start to fall for someone it's easy to put common sense on ice.  Because of that, this is not a bad little book to keep handy for when you need the occasional friendly little kick (...).
B000059T1G|4.0|Traffic's third album, \\"Last Exit,\\" was originally intended to be the group's final album (hence the title), as Traffic leaders Dave Mason & Steve Winwood were splitting up over creative differences at the time, and because of it, both men decided to put Traffic out to pasture. Thankfully, this did not happen, as Winwood, flautist/saxophonist Chris Wood and drummer Jim Capaldi unexpectedly revived Traffic with their 1970 classic, \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" (but that's another review). In the meantime, \\"Last Exit\\" is a great odds-and-sods Traffic album, containing several rare singles like the lighthearted \\"Shanghai Noodle Factory\\" and the groovy \\"Medicated Goo,\\" and a pair of barnburning, jamming live tracks (recorded at the Fillmore West) in the form of \\"Feelin' Good\\" and \\"Blind Man.\\" \\"Last Exit\\" is an excellent album that no Traffic fan should do without.
B0000C1733|5.0|This cd is awesome.  Under the Bridge is one of the best songs I've ever heard.  I've listened to it hundreds of times and still haven't gotten tired of it.  Other standout tracks are Otherside and By the Way.  Scar Tissue is a pretty good song that was played on the radio a lot a couple of years ago, but it's not my favorite.  Go out and buy this cd.  If you don't usually like Red Hot Chili Peppers, at least listen to Under the Bridge and that might help change your mind.
B00006L3S3|5.0|I love this album! Its fun and has such great songs on it that I'm so surprised it gets sort of gets overlooked amongst John's other albums. Ok, it doesn't punch you out like \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" or mesmerize you like \\"Imagine, \\" and it may not be quite as poignant as \\"Double Fantasy\\" but its still so lovely. All the songs on here are great. Ok, the Nutopian Anthem thing doesn't count because it isn't a song, and maybe Only People could be one of John's lesser efforts, but everything else is excellent. For all the other songs, this album is worth getting into.<br /><br /> Out the Blue is simply gorgeous, as is I Know, and Tigt A$ simply rocks, as does Meat City- which is an AWESOME rocker. Then there's One Day at a Time, which Elton John covered, the title track (just breathtaking), Intuition- so fun! I adore this album. I play it more than \\"Imagine\\" I'll tell you, though that is quite a gem to say the least. Buy this remastered version! Its like coming back to a whole new experience. You'll understand where all the John love comes from once again.
B00004XONN|5.0|My favorite cd, by my favorite band!  It's hard to describe Kid A in words....I remember when I first got this cd 4 years ago...I was so mesmerized.......spellbound almost.....This was the first Radiohead cd I ever owned, and it changed me, and my life.  Music is taken to different levels, and reaches different heights with this amazing release.   <br />This is music that makes you feel, makes you think, makes you calm & relaxed, makes you appreciate, makes you realize & feel things you've never thought about before..........a must have for anyone who is  truly, deeply connected, and entwined with the essence of Radiohead......or is ready to be!
B0000AFQS0|5.0|This DVD is part of the new breed of DVD remasters (the other, so far, is the Led Zeppelin DVD remaster).  Decayed and broken film reels are reprocessed and digitized to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars.  Reels were literally pulled from garbage cans!!  This is a masterwork of engineering and devotion to the music.<br /><br />And what music it is!!  The sound is crystal clear and LOUD.  The picture is as pristine (if not MORE pristine) as when it was first shot.<br /><br />The extras are nearly as good as the film!  Check out the multiple camera angles, or better yet, listen to two isolated tracks of The Ox's bass.  Only Entwhistle's bass can be heard in this \\"extra,\\" and it's fun to turn up your subwoofer to maximum and feel him shake your walls!  There is also a small documentary on the actual restoration of the film, a Who Quiz, and more.<br /><br />I really recommend this to any fan of Rock and Roll.  As for the film CONTENT, you watch a hungry young band that is having fun and at the pinnacle of their powers (1969's Rock and Roll Circus appearance) morph into a band that is old, tired, and simply running thru the motions (final Baba O'Reilly sequence).  And the music, when cranked up on your 5.1, will crack your walls!
B0002SROSQ|5.0|If you pinned me to the ground and tickled my feet with boa feathers, I'd probably confess to not being that impressed by NOCTURAMA, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' previous album. It felt weary, conventional (those two dead, bed and burning songs aside) and washed-out. If a man as tirelessly self-creative and mythologising as Nick Cave could ever be accused of treading water, then NOCTURAMA would be the only evidence to present in support of such an accusation. Remarkable in a career spanning over twenty years. <br /> <br />Thankfully, the time has not come to bury Nick Cave, but to praise him. Over and over. ABATTOIR BLUES/LYRE OF ORPHEUS is a triumphant re-statement of Nick Cave's epiphany-rich pursuit of his creative muse. His lyrical facility is intact (in truth, that never deserted him on NOCTURAMA). What strikes on listening to the new album(s) is the texture of the arrangements. They are both more spacious and dense, cavernous and intimate, poured over with the richness of gospel choir backing and harmonising. Individual components emerge less often than in the past, in favour of a density of sound that harkens back to LET LOVE IN and HENRY'S DREAM, and yet manages to sound new. The maudlin Hamlet-like pose of the not-so-young man contemplating his mortality which Nick Cave exercised to such effect on BOATMAN'S CALL, AND NO MORE ... and even NOCTURAMA has largely been replaced by a tidal wave of passion. Passion for his visions, his words, the power of his voice, the love of his songs. He reconnects to his past whilst pointing the way forward. His muse should rest content this year: she's been well-served. It only remains for me to say, 'thank you'.  <br /> <br />
0393035158|5.0|Mum always insisted; \\"Don't discuss politics or religion!\\"  These days the two are too thoroughly intertwined to avoid discussing one without the other.  Sam Harris thinks so, and is emphatic that we need to recognise that.  He doesn't like religion - there are too many illogical and inconsistent expressions of it.  He's particularly concerned about how religions manifest themselves in politics.  In this challenging and provocative book, he urges us all to be aware about what the \\"faithful\\" learn about their gods, and how they express that learning.  He finds the situation dangerous, threatening enough that immediate action is overdue to correct the peril we face.  This cry of alarm must be heeded, and Harris has done a thorough job of explaining why we must act.<br /><br />In the West, he notes how religious tolerance, after a long struggle to gain acceptance, poses a conundrum.  Tolerance means acceptance, but the faithful in the three extensive monotheistic religions, preclude tolerance.  \\"The Book\\", accepted if not admired universally, demands the diminution, if not the destruction of \\"heresy\\".  He's particularly scathing of Islam's own \\"Book\\", the Qur'an in its insistence on rooting out infidels.  Thus, there is no \\"border\\" to the Islamic world short of the planet itself.  This, he argues, is a tangible threat.  We've experienced one of its most diabolically conceived acts in the destruction of the Twin Towers.  This, he argues, is but the first of a series of acts that will grow increasingly severe with the passage of time.  Those in the West stressing that the suicide bombers are \\"fanatics\\" and \\"fundamentalists\\" are deluding themselves.  It is clear, Harris says, that Islam \\"must find a way to revise itself\\".<br /><br />Harris recapitulates the history of the Christian churches, with their extensive campaigns of expunging their own heretics and the Jews.  With both religions driven by divine commands, as expressed in the \\"Books\\", the gods insist on obedience by all people.  Those \\"chosen\\" to carry out that dictation are, of course, the faithful.  Those insisting on \\"tolerance\\" are reading the \\"Books\\" selectively.  To Harris, this is a shortsighted approach.  Others see The Books as divine ordinances that must be obeyed.  Christianity's long, bloody record is vividly presented, from the Inquisition through baptising Indian children before immediately executing them, the hunting of witches and other obscenities.  Nazism, often portrayed as the mindless expression of a few adherents, Harris argues, is simply another form of mainstream religion.  It certainly had the tacit approval of the Papacy.  The injunction to \\"purify\\" is still with us in many guises - even if only at the level of banning \\"Harry Potter\\" as endorsing witchcraft and wizardry, expressly condemned in Christianity's \\"Book\\".  Our enemy, Harris notes, is faith itself.<br /><br />As a neuroscientist, Harris arrives at an unexpected solution to the ills of a religious societies.  To Harris, the bizarre logic of Christianity - you can mutter a few words over your favourite Burgundy to render it into \\"Christ's blood\\" - must be shelved.  So, too, must be the religion that claims to be the \\"chosen\\" of a desert deity.  One that can condemn a man to death for writing fiction is morbidly irrational.  Since all these concepts are but symptoms of \\"normal people embracing madness as something holy\\" a fresh means must be found.  He's studied the various ideas of consciousness and discovered our notion of it can be abandoned.  Harris argues that the Eastern mystics provide the solution.  By abandoning the old faiths and learning the lessons mystics have acquired, the need for eliminating other humans for their derelictions of faith would evaporate.  Although a rational recommendation, it remains difficult to envision how such transformation would be effected.  The current technique of using \\"smart bombs\\" and imposed cultures is clearly inadequate, not to say unreasonable.<br /><br />Harris's book is a must read for everyone.  How else could the issues be confronted?  His history is sweeping, if necessarily brief.  His denunciation of religions is fully justified for their past and present practices, let alone the flawed foundations on which they rest.  What is needed is a campaign strategy - the only shortcoming this book exhibits.  Read it and make one of your own.

0743454529|5.0|I recently started reading this book for the 2nd time. I am about 100 pages into it and even though I know the outcome, it is no less intense. The characters are so beautifully drawn,I could not help but feel empathy for them. This book pulled all kinds of emotion out of me. I actually felt like a had a relationship with the characters.     The story is told from the various points of view of all the main characters. Without giving too much away... this story is about tough decisions, about how significantly a simple choice can affect others, about how a family can tear each other apart or bring each other together, it is about two young girls who have to make decisions that involve life and death...something that teenage girls should not have to think about.    I found the mother (Sara) detestable through the first parts of the book. She simply chooses to focus her entire life on the state of her daughter (Kate) who is dying from leukemia. Sara decides to genetically engineer and give birth to a second daughter (Anna) for the simple purpose of donating Anna's parts to Kate. Anna realizes and it is made clear to her by Sara that her only purpose in life, and for life, is to keep Kate alive.    I do not know how I would act as a parent or sibling in this situation, thus I can't really speak against or for the decisions that are made. I do think Sara could have at least made an effort to show that she loves all 3 of her children and not just the sick one.    The end of this book was truly heartbreaking, but in a good way. I cried more than I expected to.     If you enjoy books that bring you right into others' lives then this is a good one. I like that the author allows the reader to both witness events from the outside, as well as from the point of view of the characters themselves, 'hearing' the inner dialogue as well as outer.     This is an incredible, well-written novel. I highly recommend it to anyone.
B000002IWH|5.0|words cannot describe how this movie and music has touched my life. when i first heard about lees death i was shocked but coming to the realization that i might not see him in any more films came to this one. the soundtrack is purified to the brink of being probably the greatest soundtrack ever its has to intertwine with the movie and this does. raw voltage of energy and hard metal is the reason why this is a success. the cure , henry rollins rage and stp have made this album feel like your in the movie a great array of music combining with melody at the end. <br />everyone should own this album a great tribute to brandon lee and the movie thats spawn it a cult classic.
B0000541AM|5.0|The warriors, an epic tale of a group of boys with the souls of poets, but the lifes of soldiers, in shiny uniforms they battle their way back to warrior's turf after being blammed for the murder of the Riffs' boss; they are chased all over the city, by cops, other gangs, babes and sexy lips talking to a microphone, a must see for urban action movies.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Having gone to see this Fahrenheit 9.11 at the age of 14 when I legally cannot vote or in fact have an opinion on anything more then the latest stupid trends or TV shows, I was really ticked off at how the country and the war are being run... why do we elect the worst posible people to hold to most powerful job in the world??? Since I figured everyone must have seen this and seen what is going on, I was quite angry this morning when I woke to find that my elders have, once again, elected a moron. Time for another four years of this fool... oh, great.
0671027344|2.0|I chose to read The Perks of Being a Wallflower for a project for my english class.  The reason I chose this book was because I heard from many people that it was a great book and they couldn't put it down. I began to read this book with very high expectations, however the book failed to meet my expectations and interest me.  I then started to wonder what everyone found so intriguing about this book.   <br /> The book is written from the perspective of a teenage high school student by the name of Charlie.  Charlie is writing a series of journal entries to an anonymous friend whose identity is never revealed.  Being a high school student myself, I found that the elements in this book Charlie discussed were greatly exaggerated.  If this is what is going on within freshman boys minds and bodies now a days there is no hope for the future.  I found that in many instances in this book the author is a little too descriptive and very public at times. For instance, throughout the novel Charlie takes you through his experiences as a freshman in high school and tells you all about the issues teenagers deal with for example, teen pregnancy, homosexuality, the use of legal and illegal drugs, sexual experimentation, abusive relationships, a death in the family, rape, bullying, fights, crushes and dating, and both social and mental anxiety. Kit also seems as though every other page Charlie writes about how upset he is and he is constantly crying, in my opinion this makes the book depressing. To me no one is really interested in reading about this in detail.  Everyone already knows about these things so why beat them to death on T.V., in movies, and now in everyday reading! It  <br /> I don't want to discourage anyone from reading this book however I personally do not recommend it.  The book is good because it may make people who can relate to problems similar to Charlie's a little more comfortable knowing they are not the only ones dealing with the same type of pressure.  For people who cannot relate to this, it may make them realize that there are many people in the world with worse problems than a broken nail.  The book tries to teach a good lesson, however in my opinion it fails to do so.  I think that the book would have been a lot more powerful if the author took out some of the useless teenage issues and go into more detail and express more of the negative outcomes of rushing things in life such as sexual intercourse or using drugs that can kill you.  Overall I give this book 2 out of 5 stars.

B000062X90|5.0|Musically, this is the greatest album in rock history, no questions asked.  Wishbone Ash were true geniuses that never got the recognition they deserved.  This album is their pinnacle.  The songs all evoke a certain mood and feeling, and complement each other perfectly.  Also, let me just say that Andy Powell and Ted Turner are the greatest guitar duo that rock has ever produced.  Andy, in particular, is my favorite guitarist of all time.  I've never heard anyone that plays smoother or with a sense of melody like him.  Likewise, Ted is no less amazing, he plays with incredible feeling and intensity (especially on the live version of \\"Phoneix\\" - WOW).  Martin Turner was a friggin' astounding bass player and possessed a rapturously melodic voice.  Steve Upton was a jazz-oriented drummer who could keep up with basically any tempo or style.  In short, these guys were just AMAZING. <br /> <br />Now, onto the album itself. <br /> <br />TIME WAS: The album's opener begins as a beautiful acoustic ballad with Heavenly vocal harmonies (is there anything these guys couldn't do?).  The tone of the acoustic guitar is awesome here.  Then it turns into a fast-paced rocker with some jaw-dropping guitar work from Andy.  A masterpiece. <br /> <br />SOMETIME WORLD: Another masterpiece!  Like the previous song, it starts out slow and peaceful, again with very lulling vocals.  Then it gets fast.  Before I mention anything else, let me say that Martin's bass playing on this one is friggin' incredible.  Listen to those fat, grumbling notes that seem to race along at breakneck speed, keeping pace with the guitars.  One of the most overlooked bass players ever.  Ted's solo is great, but Andy's is almost beyond comprehension.  Quite possibly the most fluid, stinging guitar solo I've ever heard.  It should be against the law to play that good!! <br /> <br />BLOWIN' FREE: Their most famous song.  And for good reason.  More awesome vocal harmonies here.  Then there's the solo.  Here, Andy aimsfor the Heavens with one of the most kick-ass blues solos I've ever heard in my life.  I just can't say enough about this guy.  The tone, the phrasing and the feel, it's just mind-blowing.  I don't care if I ever hear Hendrix again. <br /> <br />THE KING WILL COME: The only song on the album that isn't 100% amazing.  Still a great tune, though, that talks about the second coming of Christ.  MORE excellent singing and a particularly great wah-wah solo from Ted. <br /> <br />LEAF AND STREAM: Beautiful.  There's no other way to describe it.  Absolutely gorgeous.  And what lyrics (which were actually written by Steve Upton)!  Martin's vocals here are simply glorious.  An amazing ballad. <br /> <br />WARRIOR: Great opening riff!  One of the most awesome choruses I've ever heard (\\"I HAVE TO BE A WARRIOR!, A SLAVE I COULDN'T BE!...\\").   <br /> <br />THROW DOWN THE SWORD: Here's where Andy and Ted really prove they're the greatest.  The duelling guitars at the end of the song are beyond words.  Quite possibly the most emotional guitar playing ever caught on record. <br /> <br />Bonus Songs: <br /> <br />JAIL BAIT: What a blues jam!  Great, stomping riff, and Ted and Andy play a lot like Stevie Ray Vaughan here.   <br /> <br />THE PILGRIM: This one contains the most amazing guitar solo that Andy has ever played (the one that starts around the 5:50 mark).  His tone and fluidity here will blow your mind.  Page, Hendrix, Van Halen - eat your hearts out!  Ted's solo is pretty killer too.  Also, the beginning features one of the most beautiful guitar melodies I've ever heard. <br /> <br />PHOENIX: The band's masterpiece.  This live version, I'm convinced, is the greatest extended live jam ever.  Allmans, Cream, even Deep Purple have nothing on this.  The changes in tempo and moods are incredible.  Ted steals the show here, not Andy.  His playing is so intense that it really does sound spiritual.  Simply breath-taking.  And when he and Andy are both jamming that riff at the end...well...nobody else stands a chance. <br /> <br />These guys are the greatest.  Buy this album NOW.
6305388458|5.0|It's a no-brainer to give a rave review to Monty Python's classic \\"The Life of Brian\\"... in fact if you're actually in need of reading a review about this film then I suggest you put away your DVD of the first season of Friends and go pick up some Monty Python before you disintigrate into mocha latte dust.<br /><br />You'll find great comedy in this movie; comedy that not only makes you laugh but also makes you think back the next day and realize how bloody genius these guys are. For those not familiar with the story, \\"Brian\\" is a parody of the story of Jesus Christ. Don't worry Ned Flanders, this film is all tongue and cheek and despite having some political commentary on religion it is, nonetheless, a harmless spoof.<br /><br />If you know anything about Python you know that it is comprised of five Brits (and a lesser known American, Terry Gilliam, whose more the director than anything - he also does all those wild animations). The six of them are above all extremely intelligent individuals who are literally experts on comedy. They play most of if not all of the characters so sometimes you have, say, John Cleese playing both a roman soldier and a Jewish rebel in the same scene.<br /><br />Their sense of humour is a perfect combination of both dry wit and outrageous slapstick. In one scene, for example, where Brian (played by Graham Chapman) is selling \\"wolf nipple chips and leopard foreskins\\" to spectators at the gladiator match, you have a dialogue between Brian and The People's Front of Judea that is sheer genius in commenting on the absurdity of the underground movements in Jerusalem. In the exact same scene, as if to contrast, you have a slapstick routine of a slave and gladiator going at it in the arena. Don't quite understand? You really need to see it for yourself.<br /><br />The DVD is great because the bonus material includes a documentary titled \\"The Pythons\\". It's basically an in-depth look at the psyche of both the collective and the individual members of the group. It's insightful, interesting and hilarious. You'll love it.<br /><br />\\"The Life of Brian\\" is a must-have for any self respecting fan of comedy. They influenced such greats as Kids In the Hall, The Simpsons and, my favorite, Christopher Gest of Spinal Tap fame. I don't like \\"cannonizing\\" things but if you really want to twist my arm then I truly believe that Monty Python are among the few truly genuinely funny people the world will ever know, and if all comedy were this good the world would be a better place.members of the group.

6305342776|4.0|Growing up in the later parts of the 1970's and all of the 1980's I was mesmerised by science fiction. Yes, I too was the little boy who had to have all the Star Wars collectibles, and watched Star trek re-runs with my father. The Black Hole offered another film to mimic characters while playing on the playground, or filled your mind with fantasy. The story line was not as drawn up, or there was not much thought into the story...but given advances in film making technology, I would not be surprised to see an eventual remake, and personally I would pay to see it.
B000002UDD|5.0|I'm not going to write a long review. Instead, i'm gonna make a track-by-track analysis.<br /><br />1. Into the Lungs of Hell [Instrumental]- Great intro, to a great album. 5/5<br /><br />2. Set the World Afire- Great song, but not the best. 4/5<br /><br />3. Anarchy in the U.K.- A cover of the Sex Pistol's hit song. This is a VERY catchy song. 4/5<br /><br />4. Mary Jane- Good song. 5/5<br /><br />5. 502- \\"Pull over s***head, this is the cops!\\" Sorry just had to say that! 5/5<br /><br />6. In My Darkest Hour- My favorite song on the album. One of Megadeth's best songs. 10/5<br /><br />7. Liar- I love it when Dave shouts \\"YOU F*****G LIAR!!!\\". 5/5<br /><br />8. Hook in Mouth- Great way to end a great album. 5/5<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />It certainly ain't Megadeth's best album, but still a good CD.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Being a loyal follower of Q magazine, stumbling upon Muse was unavoidable, since they have been lauding them from the release of their debut album Showbiz back in 1999. The Radiohead comparisons, unavoidable as they may be, are getting less relevant as Muse evolve as a band. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry, is by far their most accomplished record to date, and sadly the one that North America has yet to see a domestic release of. It's worth the import price, believe me.<br /><br />Simply put, Origin of Symmetry is part rock album, part rock opera. Matt Bellamy's vocals may have a Thom Yorke howl, but he really stretches himself thin here, hitting high falsetto on several occasions, most notably on \\"Micro Cuts\\", which is definitely the most intense song on the album. The two opening songs are a double-whammy of dreamy piano with a guitar riff that kicks in out of nowhere. \\"New Born\\" and \\"Bliss\\" are by far the two most accessible tracks on the album, and they set the tone perfectly for the rest of the album. \\"Plug in Baby\\" and \\"Citizen Erased\\" are more Rage Against the Machine, with screeching guitars and labored vocals, while \\"Screenager\\" and Megalomania\\" are more epic in scope. Aside from the vocal similarities, this album sounds almost nothing like Radiohead, in that it is not so much art school rock as more sonic rock with an apocalyptic feel to it.<br /><br />Having praised the album, all I have left to say is that Muse are best experienced live, as I had the pleasure of seeing within a day of writing this review. Their reputation as one of Britain's best live acts is well deserved, and their songs really come to life when played live. After seeing the concert, I appreciate the albums even more, and Origin of Symmetry is definitely their masterpiece.
B000002V0Q|5.0|I'm not gonna write a lengthy review, instead i'll write a track-by-track analysis.<br /><br />1. Skin O' My Teeth- My 2nd favorite song here. I LOVE the chorus: \\"No escaping fate/You belong to me/Clinging onto life by the skin o' my teeth\\".  5/5<br /><br />2. Symphony Of Destruction- Megadeth's biggest hit. Also, this is my favorite song here. 5/5<br /><br />3. Architecture Of Aggression- The heaviest song on the album. 5/5<br /><br />4. Foreclosure Of A Dream- Along with Symphony of Destruction, my favorite song here. 5/5<br /><br />5. Sweating Bullets- The worst song on the album, but it's still great! I like Dave's vocals here. 4.5/5<br /><br />6. This Was My Life- Good song. 5/5<br /><br />7. Countdown To Extinction- I LOVE this song! The 3rd best here! 5/5<br /><br />8. High Speed Dirt- A good song. 5/5<br /><br />9. Psychotron- Another good song. 5/5<br /><br />10. Captive Honour- See above^.  5/5<br /><br />11. Ashes In Your Mouth- Great way to end a great album. 5/5<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />If you want to start a Megadeth collection that's not a 'best of'<br /><br /> collection, pick this up.
0887307280|3.0|good basics in here to help get on your game for running a business, especially a very small one, but nothing too startling for the seasoned business reader.  if you're an absolute novice to business books and need desperately fast advice on how to rescue your small business and your attitude about running it, this is a good book.  but if you're a little more serious, before i read this i'd start with the jack welch stuff, or `in search of excellence,' or `built to last', or `leadership and self-deception,' or, or, or...  if only i had a nickel for every 266 page popular business book that should have been merely 60 pages!

B00006CXXU|5.0|I really enjoy this cd. I love the fact that it switches between the different genres of music. You get a little bit of everything in it. I also feel like she put her soul into this cd. The last cd was cute, but I am glad she is showing her real side instead of doing what others tell her! My favorites are Get mine, Dirty (I've heard it a million times and I am still not sick of it!), Impossible (you gotta love having Alicia Keyes help her!), ect ect ... I recommend this cd to everyone!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just realized I haven't reviewed Firefly yet! What was I thinking? <br /> <br />I used to like Babylon 5 and ST:TNG.  Now they seem... insubstantial.  The sense of wholeness to Firefly's world far exceeds that of any other SF TV series I've ever seen.  The words coming out of the characters' mouths seem utterly real.  Another reviewer mentioned that any episode of Firefly could easily be expanded into a feature-length movie, and with that I agree. And therefore I'm not as excited about the upcoming \\"Serenity\\" movie as many others are (though *of course* I will see it, probably multiple times), because it means we'll get, in essense, only one more episode.  Firefly belongs on TV, on a network that appreciates what it's got: the best SF TV show ever produced. Maybe the best TV show ever.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Listen up, Bush. It's time you bring our troops home, and its time that the American people kick you out of office. I am enraged as I listen right now to the news on CNN. Do you know what they say? Bush has won this 2004 election. You know what that means? It means that some southerners couldn't get their head on straight and now, we are stuck with this president for another miserable four years. The east coast gets the picture. New York gets the picture. Pennsylvania gets the picture. Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire gets the picture. Even our own capital of D.C. wants this terrible president and ignorant human being OUT OF OFFICE. But before this chaos ensued, Michael Moore made Fahrenheit 9/11, a thoughtful documentary showing the people that couldn't already figure it out who W really is. He wants to please his daddy. He wants presidential fame. All he's doing right now is making a mess of things, and Moore showed us all Bush's treachery. Some people just can't figure themself out, and those people make up half the union. Basically, America, you made the wrong choice in 2004. You screwed up real bad. And you WILL pay. This powerful documentary only further proves my point. Senator Kerry, I support you, and your motives. You were my unanimous choice for president, along with millions of others who wanted you. You knew what you were doing. You would have bent America's twisted spiral into a straight line to success. Maybe if Bush hadn't stole the 2000 election, we wouldn't be in this boat anyway.
B0002O0CM0|2.0|This is the first attempt at a Doors LP made after the death of singer Jim Morrison. The original group is en tact, with regular producer Bruce Botnick behind the boards, so it basically \\"sounds\\" like a Doors album. The songwriting quality is comparable to that of Robby Krieger's songs on The Soft Parade - medicore, but somewhat consistent. Bassist Jerry Scheff, who played on much of their 1970 LP L.A. Woman plays on nearly half of the album. If you find this one in a $1 bin at the record store, check it out. Other than that, it's a minor curiousity, and you'd be better off with Ray Manzarek's The Golden Scarab.
B000002TYX|5.0|Included on this CD are rare, never-before-released outtakes of the Beatles' best-known recordings...with extras thrown in.  It opens with a new song called \\"Free As a Bird.\\"  Though not as good as \\"Real Love\\" (released on the second Anthology), it is interesting to hear.  Then we transition into the mid 1950s when John, Paul and George made their first record, a cover of Buddy Holly's \\"That'll Be the Day.\\"  It and its B-side are presented here in great quality.  Then we hear three home recordings from Paul's garage in 1960, followed by Hamburg, Decca, and finally outtakes from the EMI studio.  There are also many live recordings on the CDs, from the London Palladium, Royal Variety Show, and Ed Sullivan.  Alternate takes from \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Beatles for Sale\\" round out disc 2.  This is a very good and historically a very interesting set.  Highly recommended.
B00000AOTZ|5.0|i think,this movie is the best..
6305212112|5.0|I have seen this movie probably 20 times in my life and I have to say it is definetly a personal favorite in my collection. This movie touches on so many emotions that it will have you angry, sad, touched, uplifted, empowered and roaring with laughter. This movie is told to a fed-up repressed housewife (kathy bates) by a sweet ,lonely ,vivacious old woman (ninny) during visits to a nursing home after a chance meeting. The intertwined story is about Idgy a Tom-boy who distances herself with the world due to a tragedy at a young age. As Idgy ages the only person she is close with is her &quot;hired hand&quot; Big George and his mother Sipsy. Idgy's mother becomes concerned with Idgy and decides to have Ruth ( a girl from idgy's past) come and stay with them to try to reach Idgy. At first Idgy is stand offish but soon they become best friends that is, until Ruth leaves because she marries. I dont' want to &quot;spoil&quot; the rest of the story so I'll leave that alone for the time being. As Ninny tells Mrs. Couch (kathy bates) they become close friends and Mrs. Couch begins to become empowered by the strong women in the stories and making some changes in her own life.  It touches on tough topics such as racism, spousal abuse, death, tragedy, loneliness, fear of death, and fear of life for some. This dvd is a must watch and own for your dvd collection.
B0002O0CM0|5.0|After hunting for the LPs a few years ago, they're out on CD. So what if Jim wasn't singing, he was there in spirit. The songs are fantastic!
B0001WTUH6|3.0|There must be something really wrong when the Extras in the DVD package is much more interesting than the main feature. Underworld is just that. The documentary on werewolves and vampires is enlightening enough, you can get the DVD just for that. If you're a budding filmmaker or comic book fan/artist, the sketches and making of features are very educational. That alone gives the film three stars.     The film itself, is simply trying-hard kewl. Having been a massive consumer of graphic novels, comic books and cheesy sci-fi/action/adventure/fantasy films from pre-pubescence to adulthood, I lowered my \\"standards\\" (if there's any) and expected some rip-roaring fanboy fun ala Riddick and Van Helsing (see my reviews). Boy, was I disappointed. The convoluted story aside (a staple in the comic-book genre), I was turned-off by the director's penchant for pretentious poses and making the camera linger so the audience can appreciate how cool his shots are (it is cool and has great lighting, in fairness, but does he have to be so obvious?). It seems he was trying very hard to out-Blade Blade and out-Matrix The Matrix. Too bad, the plot was kind of interesting yet his storytelling made it as hazy as a Transylvanian fog.  The revelation that reveals the true relationship of vampires and Lycans was also interesting but somehow became anti-climactic because of the numerous and heavy-handed foreshadowings, to make sure the viewer gets it. Oh, well, maybe my kids will find it cool when they turn 11.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|I have been a fan since her very first club single, and CD.  All throughout her career, she has constantly changed, and at times seemed to vanish from the charts, mainly due to the diagnosis of breast cancer in Jan 2003, I  Love this CD & It proves she can win over the gay main stream club atmosphere switch to rhythm and blues then around to a metal chick, on this latest masterpiece!  She has proven that nothing is going to stop her from doing her best and fight her way back doing what she was born to do, even if the CD is never released in the USA she is still a fighter, and she keeps my foot tapping, singing along, she is one beautiful woman (left Outside Alone, Video reminds me of Faith Hill in Breathe).  Sick and Tired, released so far over seas, has her teaming up again with remixer Jason Nevins, re-working this track into a groove beat that gets you singing, and awaiting the latest release.  If you really adore sexy female rockers, with a great voice this CD is for you, just proves that everyone changes there style over and over again, and being a gay male who loves \\"club remixes\\" etc... I can't help but play this CD.  It really is great, and the lyrics are superb/ Jason33305@aol.com
B00004TS0E|5.0|I'm skeptical on remakes, but I've been watching this one for years and feel it's better than the original.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Everybody knows Pink Floyd's 1973 \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" album. 35 million people own it. Many love it. It's made many a \\"favorite albums\\" list. Everybody has at least HEARD about how it synchs up to \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\". But how many people know the story? That's where this DVD comes in... <br /> <br />What this DVD is, is a documentary about the making of Dark Side Of The Moon, as told by all four band members, Alan Parsons, and a few others. It's a great DVD for Floyd fans. It's interesting to hear the stories from Dave Gilmour, Roger Waters, etc. themselves, and for them to provide old demos from '72, and to do acoustic performances of the familiar songs. Not to mention it includes interesting visuals to go with the songs themselves (like the end of \\"On The Run\\" is a plane flying just over a canyon, and \\"Eclipse\\" is a giant eyeball looking at an... eclipse). And we even get a picture of the Irish guy who says \\"There's no dark side of the moon, really... matter of fact, it's all dark\\". (His name was Gerry O'Driscoll). <br /> <br />A couple of questions go unanswered, though... such as, was the synching of Wizard Of Oz intentional or just a weird coincidence? And what was that faint, mysterious organ music playing at the very end of \\"Eclipse\\"? Oh well, if they go answered, it could take away some of the album's mystique. <br /> <br />Anyway, a great, recommended DVD for fans. <br /> <br />And even Dave Gilmour can't help but mention how he wishes he could've been someone listening to the album with headphones in the dark for the first time...
B0000TB01Y|5.0|As a big fan of Oz, I purchased this cd as soon as it was available.  I listened to it all the way through the first day I received it.  GREAT.  Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel shine throughout!!!  Their combined efforts on \\"For Good\\" is by far my favorite track on the cd.  \\"The Wizard and I\\", \\"Popular\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\" are way up on the top of my list.  The cd is fun and enjoyable from start to finish.  You won't go wrong by adding this to your collection.
B00006AW2M|3.0|This album is the Rolling Stones \\"answer\\" to [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]].  This was the first Stones album not produced their manager, Andrew Loog Oldham.  Given the freedom to produce the album themselves, they went overboard with \\"experimentation\\".  In addition to the gimmicky \\"psychedelic\\" sounds, the songs they wrote are weaker than usual.  But there are a couple of great songs here, that being \\"She's a Rainbow\\" and \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\".  My third favorite song here is, surprisingly, the Bill Wyman penned and sung \\"In Another Land\\".  The rest of the songs range from bad to mediocre.  The worst is the interminable instrumental version of \\"Sing This All Together\\", which goes on and on and on.  But the album does have it's moments, and some people seem to like it more than I do.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The daunting task of providing a comprehensive review of this outstanding series has been tackled by others. In its accuracy, attention to detail, respect for the truth, and in its touching humanity, \\"Band of Brothers,\\" is THE pre-eminent small unit account of the great Crusade in Europe.<br /><br />In addition to its excellent acting, narration and production, \\"Band of Brothers,\\" is an historical work rather than a work of fiction and entertainment like too many \\"war movies,\\" from the last ten years.<br /><br />This series is vitally important. It is, as far as any history can be, a considered, retrospective chronicle of past times, and we collectively, as a nation, need to remember those times.<br /><br />This is not fiction. As was written on a photo taken of another incident from that war, \\"This really happened!\\" We need to remember that.<br /><br />It is ironic, though not unexpected, that the sacrifices of the men like those of Easy Company are only now being appreciated as those men reach the end of life. But that appreciation, however belated, is vital to the affirmation of our national character and national resolve in these trying times.<br /><br />Americans do not go to war lightly. In every conflict, we need to understand, \\"Why We Fight.\\" I can only hope that current and future generations of our children will watch this important work.
0767830555|2.0|Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a porno-loving, taxi driving, pie eating, Vietnam veteran that is slowly revealed to be completely out of his mind. <br /> <br />I will try my best to review the movie without giving much plot away. <br />De Niro seems to be fairly sane at the beginning of this movie, but slowly (and I do mean slowly) his sanity gives way. Apparently he cannot stand the lack of morality and sleaze that he incounters every night, and eventually he snaps. <br /> <br />I personally did not care for this movie, but to each his own. <br /> <br />On a scale of 1 to 10 <br />Violence-2/10 <br />(There is some, but it falls short of the build up the movie creates) <br />Musical Score-0/10 <br />(Absolutly Dreadful ragtime/blues/jazz soundtrack!) <br />Acting-6/10 <br />(De Niro was good, but other acting was forced:ie. 13-year-old Jodie Foster acting like a prostitute was lacking) <br />Story-5/10 <br />Overall-3.5/10
B0001BKAEY|1.0|What the hell was it about, anyway?  Nothing in \\"Revolutions\\" made sense.  The war isn't over, the humans are still slaves, Neo is dead, and the Matrix still exists.  Nothing is resolved, nothing gained.  What a complete waste of film, time and money.  They should have stopped after the first one.
B00005JLWN|2.0|Equilibrium strives to be a hybrid of Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and The Matrix. Unfortunately, it lacks the powerful social commentary of Fahrenheit 451 and 1984 and fails to achieve the technical mastery and philosophical underpinnings of The Matrix. In reality, director Kurt Wimmer has merely remade Logan's Run with the stylistic sensibilty of The Matrix. He should have called the movie Neo's Run. <br /> <br />Sure, the gun fights are cool, Christian Bale is effective as a poor man's Neo and I actually enjoyed this movie. However, it is absolutely absurd to suggest that this movie even approaches the literary or cinematic greatness of the aforementioned titles. The sets are cheap, the CGI is poor, the costumes are cheesey and Taye Diggs is absolutely abysmal. <br /> <br />In short, Equilibrium draws inspiration from a broad spectrum of superior sources and ends up being nothing more than a bit of mindless fun.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|...the first \\"Matrix\\" was groundbreaking.  Equal parts William Gibson, Phil Dick and Franz Kafka all rolled into one tightly written, finely crafted whole.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the creators of this masterpiece have fallen into the old, tired Hollywood infection called \\"sequelitis\\" wherein the producers of a breathtakingly original film try to squeeze even more money out of it than they really have the skill for.   <br /> <br />\\"Reloaded\\" fails on so many levels it's hard to know where to begin, so I think I'll concentrate on the worst point.  That is, the Architect. <br /> <br />What was the point of dragging us through an hour and a half of fight scenes and occasionally interesting plot twists, only to have a couch potato in a white suit tell us that it's all irrelevant anyway?  Did anyone actually bother to read the script before cutting it to film?  Apparently not - if they had, they'd have noticed it.  This is a plot hole so big you could drive a truck through it, and the worst part is that there's a third irrelevant movie to follow!  Why bother? <br /> <br />The Wachowskis had a great thing with the first movie.  They should have left well enough alone, and not destroyed the myth.
0156027321|5.0|Author Yann Martel has come up with a fanciful tale that revolves around faith, and the story seems to challenge and deepen with every turn of his far-fetched plot. There are two distinct stories told sequentially and book-ended by the recollections of an older version of the main character, the son of a zookeeper in Pondicherry, India. What makes Martel's novel especially compelling is how the two stories tie together through his theme without pontificating about it either way. He first deals with faith directly as a question of identity for the teenaged Pi, who concurrently embraces three different religions in order to encompass how he views God in all the different forms presented to him. Martel uses subtle humor as well as personal insight to get his points across.<br /><br />Then in an interesting turn, Martel masterfully feeds the second story with the first one by arguing against \\"anthropomorphosis\\", a concept that ascribes human emotions and traits to animals. Pi instead believes animals are creatures of habit and content to repeat their daily routines once all their needs are met. Baby boomers will recall this to be the same tenet Joy Adamson was espousing in \\"Born Free\\", but the point this time around is not to humanize and sentimentalize the animals inhabiting his story. Rather, this concept proves to be an indispensable survival tool when his family decides to move from India to Canada aboard a Japanese cargo ship, which sinks and forces Pi to share a lifeboat for the better part of a year with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. But the story is not so much one of persisting against all odds, as one would expect, but rather it is much more focused on confronting unrelenting challenges to one's beliefs in the face of extraordinary circumstances. Martel then goes further by challenging us at the end to disbelieve it all, thus enveloping the reader into his overriding question of faith. Despite the use of some literary conceits, such as having the older Pi tell his story to the writer, this is a wonderfully creative book that deserves the praise heaped upon it.r Pi tell his story to the writer, this is a wonderfully creative book that deserves the praise heaped upon it.
B000000OE7|2.0|I'm as big a Queen fan as anyone, but honestly I think alot of these 4 and 5-star reviews are more \\"Freddie Lifetime Achievement Awards\\" than they are for the actual music on this album...if Freddie lived on & Queen continued, AND this album was still released \\"as is\\", there'd be a helluva lot more folks criticizing it IMO. Don't get me wrong, Freddie gives it 110% here, it's just that the cupboard was pretty bare in terms of what material he had to work with. In fact, many of these songs weren't \\"new\\" at all, and could be found on different bandmembers' solo albums...and there's even a song previously released as a B-side from the Miracle sessions. But Made In Heaven DOES require a listen or two, simply because although musically it has a mostly upbeat vibe, lyrically it's a haunting experience...this album was released a few years after Freddie died, yet you'd swear he was present & accounted for in the studio, more-or-less saying \\"don't worry dear, everything's alright!\\" All in all, there's a few gems on here, but newbies should probably check out some other Queen albums first...a great album from the same era worth looking into would be INNUENDO...
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|We saw the Bourne Supremacy and thought it deserved 5 stars. I would see it again, and I rarely like to see movies twice, especially in a close time frame. See it, buy it-- it is most entertaining. I can't imagine why it got less than three stars. I have restless leg syndrome and if a movie isn't good, I cannot sit there for the movie. I have to get up and walk around. No walking around on this super thriller. <br />
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Van Helsing is an action packed and historical character, make believe story that finishes with sequel-attached movie in mind. (Take a breath run on!)<br /><br />  Van Helsing, (Hugh Jackman) the notorious vampire/demon slayer is cast as the savor from the dreaded power-hungry Dracula. (Richard Roxburgh)  The Wolfman and Jekyll/Hyde characters make special appearances. Also, Frankenstein is cast as good character. (Yes he is good.)<br /><br />  This movie starts fast, slow towards middle but speeds up again for the ending. Rent this DVD to see the special effects. Dracula's three female vampires transformation from lovely women to evil vampires is flawless. They wreak havoc on Transylvania folk. Wolfman's screen transformation is a must see. Widescreen edition and digital/high definition television is a must for total theatre experience.<br /><br />  The Transylvania set scenes is filmed realistic. The era is detailed perfectly.  Character costumes are detailed to exact Transylvania specifications.<br /><br />  Transylvania or Dracula's country is run my vampires. Van Helsing must find Dracula's lair to kill him. As detailed in the movie, Dracula and Van Helsing go way back in history.

Van Helsing leaves you pining for more. And he will be back.
B000059XUI|1.0|This film is one of the most painful experiences I've ever had as a Superman fan. The character is just torn to shreds, and is by far the worst defiling a superhero has ever suffered in film. <br /> <br />Why, you may ask? <br /> <br />I flip out with geek rage every time I see Superman give up his powers to live with Lois Lane. First of all, it is the single most selfish, childish thing a person could ever do, and it is not the least bit befitting of the greatest hero of all time. And why would he do it, anyway?! Lois fell in love with SUPERMAN, not Clark Kent. <br /> <br />I could rant on for hundreds of words in regards to Clark Kent picking a fight and even BULLYING a man in a diner for virtually no reason or his inexplicable regaining of super-powers, but its not healthy being as angry as I am writing this. Suffice it to say, this film is just profoundly stupid, offensive, and detrimental to the Superman mythos. But that's just how I feel.
B0002KVUKW|2.0|the directing of this movie is really poor, the the camera always rotate insanely fast anytime you found something flying in sky, which when you realise that later it looked really boring because its like telling you straightly this part is done in CGI and its fake so it spin so fast so you dun find the glitches in details... so  poor, the directing is a big time sucker, the director is the worse i've seen for doing this kind of big bugget movie, the whole drop bored even they managed to give you CGI  thril every couple of minutes. Dracula - the Bram Stocker one from 10 years ago is absolutely better than this crap, such a pitty.. more of these the holywood will drop dead liek these vampires.. 2 stars are all given to CGI studio, zero for anything else involved.
0156907399|4.0|..... but perhaps not the greatest story teller?<br /><br />This book is one of the hardest I've tried to rate. The ending with its multiple perspectives - those on the boat, and those on the shore - is wonderful, and with just the right mix of the visionary. It's almost a ghost story, but nothing like any other ghost story I've read.<br /><br />No matter where I picked the book up, and took up reading again, I was fascinated. I could feel the holiday the characters were experiencing as if I was there at the seaside even though I have only had one short holiday in Britain. But, then, I suspect that family life and the desultory holiday experience was very similar here in Australia. I don't really mean desultory, but the routine holiday venue with its hours of no-work, no-school often had a strange feeling of tedium mixed with the 'excitement' of something different from routine. Unfortunately, reading this book also resurrected the feeling in me - the book too well records the feeling - and I quickly found myself drifting off into my own private world and not regarding the words as well as I should - only to be fascinated again as my attention snapped back.<br /><br />The book is wonderful for its multiple perspectives. Here is an example of a change of view mid-paragraph (this sort of thing often had me re-reading as my attenton drifted).<br /><br />\\"What damned rot they talk, thought Charles Tansley, laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate, which he had swept clean, as if Lily thought (he sat opposite her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to make sure of his meals. Everything about him had that meagre fixity, that bare unloveliness. But nevertheless, the fact remained, it was almost impossible to dislike any one if one looked at them. She liked his eyes: they were blue, deep set, frightening.\\"<br /><br />The stream-of-consciousness writing style used by Woolf as closely as anything I have experienced imitates the greatest attribute of fine music - counterpoint - the ability of the mind to track and appreciate many strands of experience at the one time, to flick back and forth between many voices. With music you can listen to the same work many times and explore the multiple voices in different ways each time without compromising your appreciation of the whole. I suspect you could do this with several readings of 'To the Lighthouse' too. Unfortunately it takes a greater commitment to re-read a book than it does to, say, listen again to a Mozart symphony.<br /><br />Woolf does have a great ending to this novel - a really memorable mood piece. Unfortunately, to extend the musical analogy, I found her melodies not strong enough, the development of ideas at times pedestrian (detail got in the way), the orchestration inadquate and the harmony not strong enough (although there is one very strong moment in the novel).experienced imitates the greatest attribute of fine music - counterpoint - the ability of the mind to track and appreciate many strands of experience at the one time, to flick back and forth between many voices.

B00005V9IL|5.0|First of all, for all those people who call this movie good CGI but weak story... here is the fact, the only so called CGI you really see in the movie is the glowry aliens and that \\"water worm\\" thing. Everything else were real things including those undersea robot, the big undersea base which was model. Speaking for realisim, those models visiually works better than a lotta CGI models thats in theater these days. That preservation of heaviness is something CGI yet can deliver, some new movies like Van Hellsing which big suckers, those vamps and wolfies still look pretty prastic, especially when they move, and that IS what the \\"standard look\\" of special effect we are looking at today.. , Matrix movies make people never bother to ask the question whether the realistic, that practical sense is important in a SciFi movie anymore, while seeing metalic pieces slashing flesh and blood is all people looking for in a SciFi movie. shame indeed. Something is really fishy about the special effect world today, its like going backward.. I remember back then watching new movies in every year's summer and winter is like seeing technology moving forward bit by bit... to see how real the world's visual can reach in a fictional world, but you dun see that now any more, people already been settled down with the scale a scrotch below what is perfectly practicle and nobody attempt to challenge anything anymore.
0345457684|5.0|Altered Carbon, the first effort by this writer is followed by a sequel, Broken Angels. Altered Carbon is one of those novels that keeps you up too late for work the next day. Morgan's imagery and character development is excellent. He manages to bring out a side of the characters that is at once endearing and totally frightening. Mixing introspection with sheer brutality and firepower, Morgan has created a technology that opens vistas and walks you right off the edge. Sweet dreams!!
B00005JMXX|4.0|its not that bad like what other said.. the movie is lacking materials make it a remarkable one disaster movies like ID4, twister or titanic, the disaster scenes felt rather short for some reason, and some scene's diagloues are quite foolish you might say. My positive thumb is given to the first 30 mins that still contain materials you wouldnt feel like you ve been wasted your time at the end of the movie, those r good enough reasons to watch it for the first time if not too much to ask for a second review.

0380807343|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a natural at writing a children's book.  The novel, Coraline, is creepy, fast-paced, and uses just the right amount of talking animals.  Coraline is also the novel's heroine and she triumphantly joins a long line extending from Alice to Philip Pullman's Lyra.  It is a short read but it is amazing what rich textures the author manages to manipulate in that brief span of pages.  There is not much time for character or plot development and it would have been fascinating to see the author develop the themes he has presented but this novel is perfect in and of itself and one should not want to stretch it out too far.  A dazzling work by a first rate fantasist.

B00005JMAH|5.0|Ah, for once... a Harry Potter movie that I didn't feel talked down to me. I loved it. A lot of people complain about the fact that the movie is VERY different from the book, but for the most part, they were just a lot of minor changes... there were only two changes I consider \\"major\\" (Harry being discovered at Hogsmeade by Draco was cut, and there's no mention of James Potter (Prongs), Sirius Black (Padfoot), Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail), and Remus Lupin (Moony, and by the way - the movie pronounces the name wrong. The name \\"Lupin\\" is pronounced \\"Loo-pawn\\", the movie pronounces it \\"Loo-pin\\") creating the Marauder's Map). The only minor changes I didn't like was the lack of Quidditch, but that didn't really affect the story anyway, and the beginning where Harry used the \\"Lumos\\" spell to see his book, which should be against the wizarding law for underaged wizardry. <br /> <br />Anyway... the acting has really improved. In the first movie, they sounded really... stiff. I also like how the actors don't seem to have much accent in their voices anymore (I'm not big on accents). The directing is also better - I like the movie's pace. The scriptwriting seemed much more mature than the older movies, where it was... childish. <br /> <br />Anyway. That's my miniscule review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Hope you enjoyed reading it.

B00004VWAF|2.0|Those of us who did not cut our teeth on Miles Davis' KIND OF BLUE \\"period\\" (say 1956-1968) as it was actually occurring may wonder what all the fuss was about; but ON THE CORNER released at the end of 1972 was as close to jazz heresy as was imaginable.  Here was the \\"legend in his own time\\" who recorded several classic jazz albums and for whom many an aspiring young jazz musician dreamed of joining his band, virtually turning his back on his beloved embattled art form and throwing his lot in with the barbarians.<br /><br />Jazz, \\"America's Truly Original Art Form\\", had been taking it on the chin for several years.  After several decades struggling, jazz had finally achieved the respect of millions around the world and at home.  It had literally gone from the whorehouse to Carnegie Hall and was being taken seriously as an art.  Then came rock and roll.  Within fifteen years, live jazz music could be found in few venues and record sales dropped precipitously.  The jazz community needed a champion to save it from diminishing sales and significance and Miles Davis had been an effective star for the cause.  Most adults at the time steeled themselves in the belief that once the \\"kids\\" then so captivated by rock grew up then they would naturally gravitate to more \\"mature\\" music.  All they had to do was wait out this temporary \\"drought\\" while conserving jazz's treasures and soon the hearts of baby boomers would harken to the long-suffering but forgiving jazz.<br /><br />But Miles Davis was a restless individual.  Musically curious, he had moved from bop, west-coast, cool, modal and hard-bop and back and forth.  BITCHES BREW was a singular fusion of rock and jazz and a true milestone in American music.  As much as most in the jazz community loved it, BITCHES BREW still made jazz lovers more than a little uncomfortable and concerned.<br /><br />When ON THE CORNER was released, the jazz community HATED it and they said so in no uncertain terms.  To this day, jazz handbooks refer to this as Miles' worst record.  Miles himself claimed indifference but he appeared stung and a little bitter at the reaction of his once-admirers.  The liner notes to this CD reissue betray this defensiveness by comparing Davis to Ellington and claiming that ON THE CORNER was an important and significant undertaking whether it was any good or not. (!!!)  Not exactly a warm endorsement.<br /><br />Looking back on it today, it is difficult to see what all the fuss was about.  Indeed, after crossing the \\"funk ocean\\" of the 1970's and 1980's, there seems to be little that is all that objectionable or surprising about it.  Jazz has long absorbed the twists and turns of funk into its vocabulary-so much so that many regard it as \\"old hat\\".  And that is where the trouble rests, while ON THE CORNER is not as horrible as everyone made it out to be, it isn't particularly any good either.<br /><br />With the first cut one is hit with a mesh of sounds and it seems that instead of a beginning someone just switched the tape machine on in the middle of the proceedings.  Washes of rhythms and beeps and groans come out of the two keyboardists, Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea.  John McLaughlin drops in some spacey chords while Jack DeJohnette rumbles on the drum kit.  Michael Henderson maintains the bass funk grove throughout while saxophones, electric sitars, and Indian tabla and tape loops and dropped in a various points.  The whole emphasis is on the \\"groove\\" and thus one isn't left with any sense of direction to music is going in.  With all the sounds one soon begins to wonder just where is Miles in all this.  But Miles at this point in time took to running his horn through electronics and utilizing a wah-wah pedal.  What sound like a guitar running through an effects pedal is in fact Miles blowing his horn in several instances.  This first cut, \\"On The Corner/New York Girl/Thinkin' Of One Thing And Doin' Another/Vote for Miles\\" ends up running almost twenty minutes. (I defy anyone to be able to tell when one part ends and another begins.)<br /><br />\\"Black Satin\\" and \\"One And One\\" are much shorter pieces that are a little leaner in instrumentation but the same emphasis is on the \\"groove\\".  At first it strikes you that the shorter cuts are more successful than either the longer first and last cuts; but they end up not holding interest.<br /><br />The last cut, \\"Helen Butte/Mr. Freedom X\\", runs at just over twenty-three minutes and too my taste is a little annoying.  While superficially similar to \\"On The Corner\\", it is not as varied and doesn't run through as many ideas.<br /><br />The Miles Davis of the 1970's has his defenders; but I am not one of them.  For all his overtures to the rock world, Davis drew very little actual popular interest.  \\"Funk\\" devotees may have been respectful of Davis; but few bothered to listen.<br /><br />All in all, ON THE CORNER may have been \\"first\\" and \\"influential\\"; but doing something first does not mean your particular effort was worthwhile.(I defy anyone to be able to tell when one part ends and another begins.) <br /> <br />\\"Black Satin\\" and \\"One And One\\" are much shorter pieces that are a little leaner in instrumentation but the same emphasis is on the \\"groove\\".

B00028HBKM|1.0|It was a bummer finding myself looking at subtitles.  I also did not experience in the fervent passion and zeal that the movie was supposedly causing.<br /><br />I think the hype is a bit much for the product.<br /><br />I'd advise you not to have \\"treats\\" or a meal as you watch this movie.  We need to remember that Caligula was mad for eating and watching gore at the same time.  This movie is pure ancient Roman gore.  This can't be too far of a cry from what Caligula enjoyed watching as he sat in his personal home eating and munching.<br /><br />A decent parent would never allow their child to see this movie.  It is the stuff Caligula had watched as a child and we know how he turned out.  It's unnerving to think of how many \\"Boots\\" sat out in those movie theaters, and how many are now sitting in the livingroom with  \\"mummsy and dahdah.\\" I mean we're talking graphic angles of torture devices on the skin as never before seen etc.

I never did see how a condenser of other peoples' reports suddenly winds up being on a covert op for the President, up to the Arctic. Then, thru a series of wild physical adventures (obviously written with the cinematic version in mind) solves the \\"alien life\\" issue and \\"saves the day\\".  I did get thru the whole thing.  Tho' it took several tries to finish it.  I did find myself talking back to the author on more than one occasion, saying \\"Oh, please, just give me a break here!\\"  All in all, I wish I hadn't wasted my money and my time on this one.
B00028HBKM|5.0|this is the type of movie I would definitly recommend it for first time viewer but on personal note I would also say I will never watch this again, the thing is despite its christ we are talking about, it is still very hard for me to looking at a man being tortured like a hanging lamb in the kitchen while is considering myself is being entained in a movie.. IT IS TOO GROSS! the fact is it goes beyond the line there are anything horible things you ve seen in movie theater, that's what credit this movie as one unforgettable one in history. By comparing this to Hannibal, Hann is barely just a little kid's nitemare. Every minute of this movie chanllenge your sense to tolerante the scale of brutality upon someone to a new level. I would say if your a believer it could work better since the man you looking at aint normal human to you after all, so its more relief since its a \\"super being\\" is tortured but not human like you and me...
B0000DIXDR|2.0|Not sure why none of the reviews are actually for the Ultimate version? They all seem to be for the basic Dirty Dancing no frills dvd versions. Anyhow, my review is for what's actually in the title here which is Dirty Dancing Ultimate Edition. Unfortunately this versin is frilless as the extra cd you get is filled w/ useless crap that is of total uninterest. You get footage of Jennifer Grey's screen test which while neat to see for a coupel min...It goes on forever and gets real boring very fast. I'd rather had seen Patricks, but that's not even an option. Then there are a few interviews one beign JG and the other are behidn the scenes people along w/ oen other actress in the film and they go on and on for so long that I lost interest after 15 min or so. Other then that the rest is simply the trailer for the film, a coupel music videos and that's it! I wanted out takes, interviews w/ Patrick as well as Jen and his screen tests etc... Not all this filler crap that's of zero entertainment value. Love this film as I have seen it well into the 100's at this point counting the numerous times I saw it when it came out in theaters. Don't pay extra for the Ultimate edition. Luckily I got mine for cheaper then if just buying the regular version off ebay so I wasted no money.
0452282152|5.0|The way that Tracy Chevalier writes of the relationship between Griet and Vermeer is challenging to me. It's difficult to get a grasp on it. He's married, she's too young, from entirely different social circumstances, there's virtually no verbal communication on who wants what (or whom). You begin to wonder if you're only imagining any significance between them. <br />Not only does she (the author) successfully and enjoyably take you to that time and place, but she reminds you of a relationship that could occur just as easily now as then. As in every good work of fiction, there are timeless truths in this novel. They're nestled in among the articulate descriptions and an achingly accurate conveyance of emotions that places this book on the shelf as a work of art.

B00005JMUA|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment, of Tarantino's quirky homage to ultra violence, spaghetti westerns, and martial arts movies, and was looking forward to this closing sequel. I gave 3.5 stars and that really is a stretch, the pace and absorbing direction of the first explosive film have seemingly evaporated. This is way way way tooooooo long, with overdone scenes, close ups and dramatic music, in an attempt I presume to give an artistic flair and fill in the drama. A fair amount of back story though essential is also overly protracted, and the end result leaves you feeling a little cheated. Were this a stand alone sequel, you could be more forgiving, but as an original single movie broken into two volumes, this is a let down. I think it was right to break the movie up, but whereas the first movies 111 minutes flew by, this marathon 137 minutes drags annoyingly. It seems as though the editing room went into overdrive in an attempt to \\"pad out\\" this movie which has a very large \\"filler scenes\\" feel to it. I did enjoy seeing the story close out, but would have enjoyed it much more with more action, less talk, and about 30 minutes less running time. Not bad, but not great.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Wow!  A movie that features Dracula, Wolfie, Frankie and Hyde.  The Problem here is maybe the approach should have been like the \\"Batman\\" films, you know only 2 villains at a time.  This film was a mess!  Noisy, overloaded with special effects, a horrible script, and confusing direction are this films strong points.  A good popcorn movie, maybe.  Too violent for children, who may enjoy the film the most, and not violent enough for adults.  This film was designed to be a blockbuster and nothing more.  It's a flash in the pan and like Dracula, has no shadows.  It's empty without any meaning or substance.  Even Kate Beckinsale looks bored.  Hugh Jackman looks happy, but he got paid very well.  He needs to stick to Wolverine.

0688163173|5.0|If you have never read any of his novels but have heard of Dennis Lehane, it is probably because he is the author of \\"Mystic River\\", which was made into an Oscar winning film by Clint Eastwood.  Knowing that he wrote that novel, which was made into such a fine movie made me want to read something else that he has written.  \\"Shutter Island\\" is his most recent novel, published in 2003.  I must confess that \\"Shutter Island\\" blew me away.  Lehane is immensely talented.<br /><br />In the summer of 1954 U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule come to Ashecliffe Hospital on Shutter Island to investigate the escape of an inmate/patient.  This hospital is for the criminally insane, and the two Marshals are searching for Rachel Solando, a convicted murderer guilty of killing her three children.  When Aule and Daniels begin investigating the escape it is readily apparent that nothing is as it seems.  Rachel Solando was barefoot when she escaped and yet made it out of a locked room, down a guarded hallway, and outside the compound on an island comprised of swampland and a rocky cliff.  How could this have happened?  Why is the hospital administration so secretive?  Are there secret government experiments being performed on the patients?<br /><br />\\"Shutter Island\\" is filled with questions and the story becomes more and more compelling as it moves along.  The story is told with sharp, realistic dialogue and it is not long before the reader questions exactly what is happening, except that the confusion is so beautiful and engrossing that you have to keep reading to see how this will all play out.  Lehane keeps throwing twists on the reader, but he does so in a realistic way that is very consistent with the story.  It wasn't until I had reached the end and the reality of \\"Shutter Island\\" was revealed that I realized just how important the beginning of this novel is and just how well crafted a story \\"Shutter Island\\" is.  Lehane connects all the pieces of the story together so that everything makes sense by the end.  The ending, while a surprise, doesn't come out of left field.  Lehane leads to it, builds up to it.<br /><br />\\"Shutter Island\\" was one of the best novels that I have read this year, and was so good that I want to read everything else that he has written.  Some novels are just that good, and this is one of them.  Give it a try.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrythe story together so that everything makes sense by the end.

B0000025YL|4.0|For an album that came out in 1983 this album was very heavy. Wolf Hoffman's guitars smoke throughout. Udo's singing is sometimes emotional and sometimes aggressive. Restless & Wild contains 4 songs that are on every Accept compilation that I have ever made: Fast As A Shark (fast! heavy! intense!), Neon Nights (brilliant, sick guitar intro), Princess of the Dawn (mystical), and the rocking title track. Other songs like Get Ready and Ahead Of The Pack rock too but I never really got into Shake Your Heads. This album kicked-off a string of four classic Accept albums.

B0002MB7QW|3.0|I thought it was pretty good even though it's unintentionally fictional, ..I didn't care. Some of the best movies have little to no truth to them. The special effects looked darn good to me, I don't understand why some have said otherwise. I won't be surprised if the Academy Awards take notice as well, the F/X are that good. The one thing that I didn't understand was how the father (Dennis Quaid) got from California to New York so quickly, I would have liked the journey to reach his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) to be more adventurous. I mean he drove in a car some of the way, then was forced to walk a portion of the way as well. It would have been more rewarding to the audience if we got to witness the pain and hardship of such a difficult rescue, for all the survival that took place there wasn't a real hero to give the credit to. Still in all the movie doesn't deserve it's bad reputation. 3 stars = pretty good.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Tim Burton has created the best mix of fantasy and drama that Hollywood has ever seen. Burton mostly known for his fantasy side directs with his usual brilliance. Although my loyalty lies with \\"Beetlejuice\\" as my favorite Burton film, \\"Big Fish\\" is an excellent addition to Burton's list of some of the most magical motion pictures ever to come out of Hollywood. The cast is superb, the set decor is out of this world, and the story is a piece of mind blowing fiction. Last but not least I always have to mention the soundtracks of Burton's films. Composer Danny Elfman is phenomenal, his music scores always add so much to Tim Burton's films. BIG FISH was recommended to me by one of my Amazon.com friends (thanks), ..of course being that I see all of Tim Burton's movies in theaters I had already seen it. It's a masterpiece in every way, after watching it again today I was reminded of just how great it truly is. 5 stars = excellent.

0887307280|4.0|This book is a guide to success for small business owners.  Gerber is the founder of a consulting company for small businesses.  In the beginning of the book, Gerber cites the well-known failure-rate statistics for small business: 40% fail in 1 year.  Of those who survive 1year, 80% fail in 5 years, and of those who survive 5 years, another 80% fail.  Over the years, Gerber has observed that the small business owners who fail often share a number of characteristics, while those who succeed do so not by luck, brains, or perseverance, but by taking a different approach.  This book explains the approach that is necessary for a business to survive and thrive.<br /><br />One of Gerber's most striking observations is that most small businesses are started by \\"technicians\\", that is people who are skilled at something and who enjoy doing that thing. (A technician can be anything from a computer programmer to plumber to a dog groomer to a musician or lawyer.) When these technicians strike out on their own, they tend to continue doing the work they are skilled at, and ignore the overarching aspects of business.  Without clear goals and quantification benchmarks, they soon find themselves overworked, understaffed, and eventually broke.  Worst of all, they may come to hate the work they do.  Rather than owning a business, they own a job, and they find themselves working for managers who are completely clueless about how to run a business- -themselves.<br /><br />The solution, Gerber argues, is for every business owner, especially the technician-owners, to balance their business personalities.  According to Gerber, every business owner needs to simultaneously be an entrepreneur and a manager as well as a technician.  The technician is the worker-bee, the one who produces the product.  The manager makes sure operations and finances run smoothly and consistently.  The entrepreneur formulates the goals, and steers the business in the direction needed to reach those goals.  Of these three personalities, the entrepreneur is key- -without it, the technician will work himself or herself to death or bankruptcy.  As the business grows, the business owner will need to draw away from the technician work and manager work and delegate this work, rather than abdicate this, to others.<br /><br />For turning businesses around, or getting them off the right foot, Gerber suggests looking at franchises as a model.  In comparison to the dismal rate of ordinary small-business start-ups, 75% of franchises succeed at 5 years.  The reason they succeed is that they are set up so that any unskilled person off the street could walk in, buy a franchise, run all operations in the franchise, and have a fairly good chance of success.  The product of franchise companies is a business model, not food, hotel rooms, etc.  In order to meet this level of success, franchise companies have clear operations manuals, procedures, consistent sales approaches- -every detail of running the business is specified down to dress codes and wall paper.<br /><br />By asking us to consider the franchise approach, Gerber is not saying to go out and buy a franchise license.  Instead, he says to imagine that you want to sell your business as a successful franchise within a finite period of time.  If so, what will you need to do regarding your business plan and management in order to meet this goal?  That is, if you were going to make your business fool-proof so that any unskilled person could take over as owner after a few years and succeed with it, what will you need to do?<br /><br />Overall, I found the ideas in this book extremely profound and incredibly useful for my own small-business venture.  The writing style can be a bit wordy and choppy at times, which is the only reason why I did not give this book full marks.  If you're a small business owner whose business is out of control, stagnant, or worse, or if you're thinking of going into business yourself, this book can be of immeasurablevalue.of immeasurable value.  <br />
B0000009TT|4.0|This album makes you wonder what it must have been like back in 1977 when FZ, after the frustration with the record labels decided not to release his megawork, to play the whole thing on the radio (ALL 8 SIDES!). Some call it a masterpiece, a freak out, or just what the (explitive). The fact is this is a perfect framework for displaying the mind of FZ. You could get this title and have what so many other FZ albums do, though Lather was split into other albums like Sleep Dirt and Studio Tan. So many examples of what FZ is capable of. In the liner notes, it says it's understandable that this album could have been composed by a multitude of writers. Lather ranges from his Varese inspired orchestral works, jazz fusion, experiments with tape speeds, live versions of \\"Broken Hearts Are...\\" and \\"Tryin To Grow A Chin\\" (found on \\"Shiek Yerbouti\\"), and other stuff from the kitchen sink. Yet somehow this eclectic collection is all held together with Frank's guitar work and humor. Yes, a few go overboard (I never really got \\"Gregory Peckory). But when you start disc 1 with the powerful instrumental \\"Regyptian Strut\\", you know you're in for something special. Think of it as going into a funhouse. You're never quite sure what you'll get, but it's one heck of a ride.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I grew up with these movies, having seen A New Hope in theaters when it was first released at age 16.  This is not the ORIGINAL Trilogy.  Lucas keeps altering the films.  Now he's digitally editing out actors and altering the plot.  Lucas doesn't understand that the fans love the movies the way they originally were...even with all the flaws.  He did a good job at cleaning these movies up, but there are lots of additional effects he's added that are subpar.  He's also done some color-correcting that, in some places, has made the picture worse (notice in the space battle that opens A New Hope that when the Imperial ship passes above the planet below it, not only do the engines glow blue...THE PLANET BELOW GLOWS BLUE, TOO!!).  It's apparent that some processes in the restoration of these movies received much more time and resources than others.  I wish Lucas would come to his senses and release the TRUE ORIGINAL TRILOGY...bugs, dirt, errors and all.  If they can release the Alien Quadrilogy with 2 versions of each movie, Lucas can do the same.  He's certainly not hurting for funds.  Mr. Lucas, give the fans what they want...unaltered and unadulterated.

6304698690|5.0|I have seen all of the movies made of The Secret Garden, and I have been in a stage production as well. This one is the best of any film adaptations. All the players are so much more real and likable than in the others, so it's easy to enjoy this presentation when you can get emotionally involved with the people in it.<br /><br />In the stage play, the chanting scene is full of music and mystery, and is an embodiment of Mary and Colin's wonderfully heartfelt wish to somehow magically call her uncle back home, so he can see how well Colin is doing and they can be a family, healing the years of anguish and loneliness that they all have suffered in different ways. This film is the only one that even came close to capturing the essence of that scene, which is meant to be whimsical, and to further establish the magical powers of the garden and of the lingering love Lily holds for them. It does so much for the story as a whole.<br /><br />I am going to purchase this DVD for the director of our stage play, who also happens to be my brother, and who did a great job with our production. It's the only one that does justice to a story that has meant so much to the whole cast and will always carry a special place in our hearts.
B00024BHTC|4.0|Ok, this is my first review on here and I decided to review something I greatly enjoyed.  This is also the first Nightwish album I have purchased myself and I am greatfull I did.  I must first start this review with a message to traditional Nightwish fans, THIS IS NOT THE NORMAL NIGHTWISH STUFF!!!  This album is much more heavy metal than the previous Nightwish albums, but that is okay because they are also backed up by an orchestra which makes it even more unique.  Think, Metallica's S&M fused with Evanesense.  This album is very different but it is still Nightwish good, now off to the songs.<br /><br />Dark Chest of Wonders-4/5  This song starts off with a very heavy metal riff, and then goes into orchestra backing about 45 seconds into it.  At the 1 minute section is when Tarja begins singing, but is \\"interupted\\" by a vocal chorus.  This continues for a minute, about the 2:30 mark it suddenly stops...and then kicks back up again.  Towards the end of the song it becomes a intermixing between Heavy guitars, a chorus, an orchestra, and Tarja's voice...the whole album can be represented by this song.<br /><br />Wish I had an Angel-2/5<br /><br />This song starts like a traditional nightwish song...but then later the male voice kicks in....and you just want to hit the skip button.  But if you bare with it, there is some very good harmony between the two, WHEN BOTH ARE SINGING AT THE SAME TIME...when it's just the guy, the song is horrid.<br /><br />Nemo-5/5<br /><br />This song was the big single for this cd, but I personally think there were other songs that would have been a better ticket.  I like this song because it has its quite parts with the piano and its heavy parts with the orchestra and guitars...it's good.<br /><br />Planet Hell-4/5<br /><br />This song starts off with a very catch with the chorus, and the orchestra.  This continues for about a minute until the drums and guitar kick in.  Again we have the male voice, which causes the song to go down a point....but it is still a very good song.<br /><br />Creek Mary's Blood-5/5<br /><br />This 8 minute song is very unique, which makes it very good.  With a complete Native American chant, the orchestra, and an acoustic guitar....very very eerie, and good.  You hardly notice the length of it, because it's so good.  The Native American singing in the middle of the song makes it epic.  The chant at the end does go on a little bit to long, but you don't notice the length of it unless your extensively listening to it.<br /><br />Siren-5/5<br /><br />We got from a great Native American song, to a great Middle Eastern song.  The female vocals in this song are incredible, and the male ones actually aren't that bad.  My favorite track on the whole album.<br /><br />Dead Gardens-4/5<br /><br />The usuall Nightwish filler.<br /><br />Romanticide-4/5<br /><br />Nothing special, but the song is a little scary at times.<br /><br />Ghost Love Score-5/5<br /><br />AH YES THE 10 MINUTE EPIC GHOST LOVE SCORE!  THIS SONG IS GENIUS, probably the best song written by Nightwish.<br /><br />Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan-5/5<br /><br />This is a very good ballad, with I believe some Cello in there.<br /><br />Higher Than Hope-3/5<br /><br />I didn't like this song as much as the others, mainly because it doesn't feel like a good song to close the album with.  I think they should have put Ghost Love Score at the end of the album instead.  But that's just me, still all in all 4/5 which is still GOOD!t it is still a very good song.   <br /> <br />Creek Mary's Blood-5/5 <br />This 8 minute song is very unique, which makes it very good.

0375703764|5.0|There aren't a lot of experimental horror novels out there.  If there were, this book probably wouldn't have been so highly acclaimed.  It is a brilliant work of art, yes, but it also loses most of its readers after two pages.  I think it's brave, intelligent, and fresh.  Horror is a genre that is progressing into the postmodern.  You see it in authors like Carlton Mellick III whose \\"Razor Wire Pubic Hair\\" novel is closer to Franz Kafka than Stephen King.  Well, if Mellick is the Kafka of horror, Danielewski is the James Joyce.  Some people might not be ready for \\"House of Leaves\\" but others will appreciate it's boldness and imagination.  It is probably THE ground-breaking book that will create a new era of horror literature.
076790592X|5.0|Mitch Album was a successful writer for the Detroit Free Press sports column yet he was still missing something.  When he was flipping through channels at a hotel he came across a clip of his old professor Morrie Schwartz whom was diagnosed with a terminal disease.  He had not talked to his old professor in years even after promising him that he would visit in the future.  After realizing he should go visit his dying professor he booked a plane for Boston and was soon sitting next to Morrie's side forgetting about deadlines and angry bosses. <br /> Morrie and Mitch had long talks about love, happiness, forgiveness and dying, things that are normally not talked about by people.  Morrie talks about these subjects with humor and sarcasm as if they were nothing but a rainy day.  Morrie talks of the day he is to die and seems to welcome it with his arms stretched open.  He seems to look at life as a memory.  Morrie feels that he has had his time to be young and now it is his time to be old, his dance is over.  He tells Mitch \\"when you learn to die, you learn to live\\". Mitch and Morrie called these talks their \\"final thesis\\". <br /> Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Album is a book that anyone can relate to.  Morrie teaches the readers the meaning of life and gives answers to some of the tough questions of life.  After reading this book the reader will have a whole new understanding on the meaning of life and have a better understanding on how to grow up and live life to its fullest.  Morrie's words will play continuously in the minds of those that have read the book and new views on life will be taken.   <br /> Tuesdays with Morrie is a very emotional book that focuses on life and the meaning of friendship, love, and death; three components that are needed to live.  It is a very good read and worth the time that it takes to read through.     <br />   <br />
B00003CXTG|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, as judging from the trailer, it was a fantastic looking movie about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  The movie turns out to be less about the attack and the war, and more about a love triangle between the three lead characters.  The scenes of the Japanese attack are truly fantastic, but apart from those visuals this movie is horrible.
6305511055|5.0|An insightful spy drama and you can't beat the last line, \\"But will they print it?\\"<br /><br />Overwhelmingly prescient given the increasing unreliability of the NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY, LOS ANGELES TIMES and CBS, not to mention CNN.
B000001EHS|5.0|My father loves Def Leppard, but I didn't (before).  I used to think that the rock that he listened to was definitely not for me.  Recently, however, I picked up this CD as a gift for him and ended up getting two copies, since I fell in love with the music. <br />The lyrics on all the songs are unique, and many of them are poetic, clever, or amusing/funny!  The songs and sounds on the CD themselves are wonderful, with a great variety, as my dad says, from the many different albums that they've released in the past, with such hits as \\"Love Bites\\" (OH GOD, how I love that song!), \\"Photograph\\" (AMAZING), and all the other ones that you see listed above.  I love them all!  There isn't a song on the CD that I don't like!  Please, I urge you all to buy this CD!  It may be the best thing you ever buy, as it has changed my music life, and I'm sure that it will impact you as positively as it has me!
0790729652|5.0|This is the one that Started it all; BATMAN, staring Jack Nicholson and Micheal Keaton.  There is nothing bad about the movie it is completely perfect in every way.  The Joker is the ultimate badguy (allthough my favorite is the Riddler)but very comicale.  This is my favorite out of the Batman series but we have to wait until \\"Batman Begins\\" to judge that.
0805062971|4.0|The book Fight Club, by Chuck Palahniuk, demonstrates strong views from a man's life. Tyler Durden, the main character lives a simple and average life as most men do in America. But for some reason Tyler strives to make his confining life better, and more exciting than it is before. Tyler decides to start an underground boxing club. In this club, friends just go all out and fight each other. Tyler has an ordinary life like others. But Tyler wants live his life to the fullest, do things that make him feel that he is actually alive. By going in all out battles, against other men, I guess it makes Tyler feel more enlivened in his life. I think the writer Chuck wanted to express the curiosity, and willingness of a man to make his life better. But the writer seems to do it in a way, which no one would ever think of doing. <br /> If Tyler was a woman, and was bored, would he have started a fight club with all women? I don't think he would have. Females, do not have the nature that makes them want to fight and hurt some one. Males, on the other hand, are more outgoing, and willing to do what it takes to have a little fun. I think the writer brings up a good point of the difference between men from women. Even though he does not say it write out in the text, you can predict that most women would no engage in this type of club. I think middle aged men; do not have any role models to look towards for help. Men, think differently then women, men do not care as much as how smart they are and what they do. Men care more about status, and how people look up to them, for example does a real man carry an umbrella, or does he get wet because rain can't hurt you. That does not dignify whether you are a real man or not, but most men seem to think that way. <br />My favorite scene in the book was when one of the characters put a gun to another  guys head, and asks him what he wants to do with his life or just make money just to buy things, and if he does not answer he will be shot. This is my favorite scene because this shows how they really wanted their lives to mean something, not just living and working because you're here. It showed how crazy they were, to actually put a gun to another human to find out a true answer about why you want to live. <br />I like the writer's style of writing in this novel. It seems confusing not being able to understand the life of Tyler, and his different personalities. But it makes you think and pay attention to the book. I think the book was serious, but on the same side funny for the unrealistic things that they did. <br />
B000001IQH|1.0|Ok, this record sucks harder than Dookie and Smash put together with a crappy Less Than Jake album. I've never cared much about what the music I listen to is about, I hear something somewhere, and I decide if it's good or bad. Even when my political or non-political opinion is the same as the \\"punk\\"-band I at that time listen to, I just can't seem to care. If I want to learn about politics, the music isn't the best way. Anyway, it seems like The Clash pretty much brought politics into the loud, fast rock called punk in the late 70's (don't care about the discussion if The Clash should be called punk or not), and now Rancid are copying them. Either that, or they are mixing some Green day with Operation Ivy. However, the ska isn't Rancids thing, they actually were pretty good when they came with Rancid [1993]. But with this album they established themselves as sell-outs, they pretty much disgraced OpIvy too. In my opinion you could listen too Reel Big Fish instead, at least they were sell-outs from the beginning..........
B00006BTCA|1.0|Man, I really must have missed the point on this one. This album is about as refreshing as swamp gas. Sounds like it was recorded in a wet paper bag. Does the guitarist know more than five chords? Wonderful what you can accomplish with a lot of distorted echo-y stuff. These guys sound like a catatonic U2.  Comparisons to the Furs and Echo are insulting (to them, that is). Kitchens Of Distinction was grinding out this bucket of sludge years ago (rigor mortis in 3/4). Let these guys break new ground and provide their own headstone.
B0001YRVN4|2.0|A genius may create love and nurture a masterpiece, but in the end his obsession with it may destroy the very essence of his creation ... <br /> <br />Having been a die hard Star Wars fan all my life and a great admirer of George Lucas, today I will be his harshest critic, as a child who watched in awe and as an adult who appreciated the deeper sentiments of the character driven epic ... I did the unthinkable today, having watched the DVD release of the trilogy ... I PUT IT BACK IN ITS BOX AND INTO THE STORE ROOM... I do not wish to acknowledge the fact that it was ever made or existed, for me the special edition release of the trilogy is the accepted pure unadulterated, uncontaminated \\"TRUE\\" version. <br /> <br />Today George Lucas has become the very corporate entity he once hated, meddling with his own films, cutting splicing adding and deleting unnecessarily in very much the same manner as the studio executives did with his earlier films. <br /> <br />For a product that has been in development this long, even a newcomer to the DVD edition of the trilogy will pick up on huge editing and post production faults, take for example episode 4 \\"A new hope\\", notice how the film skips frames at certain points, or the lack of color correction and the green bounding boxes around the Tie Fighters in the fight sequence when the Falcon is escaping the death star, The escape pod lying on the desert in the first scene where the chroma key blue color has not been removed, or the fact that there is a scene in which Vader finishes his sentence early and then continues to move his hands about mouthing something to governor Tarkin when the sound track is silent, or maybe the annoying yellow smudges of color whenever the light sabers clash. <br /> <br />Disastrously poor production quality control aside, classical elements which all star wars fans have always loved have been heavy handedly altered without any reason, remember that beautiful music score as the attack on the death starbegins, which is the high point holding the entire sequence together ... anchoring the emotions the rebels are going through .... ITS ALL GONE ... muted so low that you can barely hear it, instead all you get is all the sound effects of laser bangs and whirls ... perhaps it is to do with politics between the two departments or whatever. <br /> <br />George Lucas once said that the only thing exceeding his expectations on the original production was that of the musical score ... today he has succeeded in diluting even that. <br /> <br />If he ever reads this I would like to say to him, Star Wars belongs as much to you as it does to the millions of fans who loved it and made the phenomenon it is today, you have taken a pure undiluted work of art and corrupted it to the point where, it people like me walk away feeling that we have been cheated. Please for the films sake realize that people loved and accepted it the day you released each of the films, you have created your masterpiece now just let it go ... step back and let us enjoy it the way it is, not the way your creative department thinks it ought to be. <br /> <br />
0790731479|4.0|Really, this is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and you know what? I loved it with all my heart. Tim Burton knew what he was doing, aparently, because this film is unbelievably entertaining. The dialogue is clever, the story is wonderful and the characters make the film shine. Winona Rider is marvelous as the troubled gothic teenager who wears black and veils to the dinner table. Her mother is a power woman designer who turns the house into a Tim Burton Dream land where all sorts of goodies can happen, especially with a little tampering from a few ghosts. This film also has a great score from Danny Elfman who worked with him previously on Batman and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. After this the director/composer duo have never split up and togehter they create magic for everyone to see and love.
B00009ATIX|4.0|Visualy and auditorily stunning and artful, but a bit scarey. It's a psychological thriller as well as a love story, scarier than 2001, and it contains blood, corpses and psychosis. Worth watching though, and not gorey, but one fears to see gore at any moment in the tense bits. It also contains nudity. It leaves you thinking with a very interesting ending. Excellent performances, but not for everyone.
B0001XALTG|4.0|Trainspotting is one of the sickest movies I have ever seen. But it is also one of the best. You can't help but like this film. It knows how low class it is. ITS ABOUT LOW CLASS. Other things have been said about the film such as its pro drugs. Just because the characters in the film like drugs doesn't mean its a pro drug film. This only shows how addicting drugs can be. Excellant acting and an experience to be held. SEE THIS MOVIE. <br />                           A-
0451528018|5.0|Having read many other Sherlock Holmes short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I decided to read this book to see what the Sherlock Holmes novels were like. All in all I thought this book was excellent. The plot was smoothly paced, never slowing down too much and there were various climaxes that are typical to Doyle's stories. Told from Watson's point of view (as all the Sherlock Holmes stories are) the books story takes place in \\"real time\\" chapters as well as chapters that are letters which Watson has sent to Holmes. This is where the only real disappointment of the book lies, Sherlock Holmes is absent in most of the story. Overlooking this, however, all the other characters in the story are marvelously created and entirely believable. And as always, people are not always as they first appear. As usual, the story leaves you in suspense the whole time and finally reveals the solution to you until right at the end when you are on the edge of your seat. All in all, I found this book to be a fine example of Sherlock Holmes literature. It is a fine mystery novel that is very eloquently written. It is for this reason that I give this book a 4.8/5 or on amazon's rating scale, a 5.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Want to get scared? Then see this movie. Forget the bad performances (with the exception of Curtis and Plesance) just see this movie. The music makes the mood of the film even more scary.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie is so good!  Great plot and extremely funny.  The story is about two daughters.  One popular, and one...socially Challenged!  Their father makes a rule that the popular daughter can't go on a date unless her sister does.  One guy finds out and pays a juvenile delincuent to go out with her.  But what do you think will happen when he falls in love with her.  See love, breakups, and paint ball fights! happen in this movie.
B0002KVUKW|3.0|I was weened on the original Universal Monster movies, I remember dialing into the late night Ghost Host UHF shows back in the day to catch \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" or \\"House of Dracula\\" and really falling under their spell. So when I heard about Van Helsing I was pretty excited. I did enjoy the Mummy movies for what they were, that is I enjoyed the Indiana Jones aspect of the films, and when I found out Sommers was in charge of Van Helsing I expected more of the same. There were elements to Van Helsing that I really liked. The Van Helsing character resembled a turn of the century James Bond who instead of tackling SPECTRE, hunted down evil. The Wolfman scenes of Van Helsing packed the biggest punch of the movie, which may have been one of the bigger problems with the film overall, seeing as how the Wolfman was a secondary character. Mr. Hyde's cameo was fun, as were Dracula's brides. But I am not a big fan of CGI special effects. I don't see the difference between CGI and a guy in a rubber suit or make-up. Sure you might see the zipper on the rubber suit, but no matter how convincing the CGI is, you can't help but notice that the monster is basically a cartoon. The biggest downfall for Van Helsing to me was Dracula and Frankenstein though. After years of associating Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff with the roles, Dracula in the film came off as a pretty weak character, one without much menace. The Frankenstein monster seemed almost helpless in the film, and came off as whiny. This movie reminded me a good deal of Sean Connery's \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\". The idea looks good on paper, but for some reason just doesn't click. This movie is just some harmless fun, entertaining while on, but forgotten by the time the end credits finish rolling. Van Helsing isn't the worst movie I've seen involving Universal's monster collection, but it is far from the best.
B00008WG3U|5.0|okay everyone these days think thier cool because they can trash talk Bush (who i think is a great person and did an amazing job).  There actually some bands that i stopped listnening to because of this.  This CD i however like very much.  Even though they trash Bush the whole time i still like it.  I think this is definetly a CD to add to the collection even if your not anti-bush.
0156012197|5.0|This book gets 6 stars! Antoine de SaintExupery, though writing at a level at which children can comprehend the plot, delves deep into a social and psychological discussion regarding the human experience.  He has a profound understanding of the way 'adults' (modern society) incorrectly view the world, its citizens, and what they have to offer. Lessons taught by this book range from personal relationships to business, touching on the subjects of guilt, greed, power, and love.  While all of these topics are thoroughly discussed, you never feel as if you're being lectured or hit over the head with symbolism.  So much is buried between the lines that one reading of this book will not suffice to gain the infinite wisdom it possesses.  Read it as a coming-of-age story for society: once every few years for the rest of your life. This simple, 96 page story about a little boy speaks volumes louder than you could imagine.
B00006690G|5.0|Yeah, actually I'm not a rap fan at all, but I totally like Eminem's stuff. I a) like the fact that Eminem doesn't hold back his opinions and b) like his humor, which you won't find in most other rappers. Yeah, he's angry, but he's got wit and style, and his rhythms are complex as hell. Gotta hand it to him, he's got talent.
B000002H33|5.0|\\"Master of Puppets\\" is Metallica's finest hour, displaying a whole new edge to their sound, their first opus \\"Kill 'Em All\\" was a gritty, in - your - face introduction to the band, and was of an unusually high standard for a first album (although there was literally no melody to be found, the album consisted of speedy riff after speedy riff. Their second album \\"Ride the Lightning\\", displayed a sense of maturity, with the trademark Metallica high - end treble sound, with cleverly inserted acoustic intros and some unbelievable guitar solos. \\"Master of Puppets\\", however, is their masterpiece, with dark atmospherics and some clever lyrical hooks, several of which deal with some key issues like drug addiction (Master of Puppets), war (Disposable Heros), and Religion (Leper Messiah). The album marks a milestone in Metallica's history, with some genuinely dark atmospherics (Sanitarium) and some truly impressive melody (Orion), and, once again, the trademark Metallica speed metal (Battery, Damage. Inc). If you do not posess this album, you are missing out on a huge part in metal history, a classic.
014028009X|4.0|Once again, it is safe to say that the book was better than the film. Bridget Jones Diary is the story of a single British woman in her thirties, written in an easy laid back journal style. It's not the most difficult book to read, so it is a perfect book for when you just want to relax. Plus, it is written from her point of view, so you always know exactly what she is thinking. Anyone who thought that insecurities are at their peak in Junior High was proved wrong by this book making it relatable not just for the adults but also the younger readers. Jones is a business woman who is taking part in a relationship with a man in her office. However, he seems to be in control. Throughout their workday they send each other misleading instant messages, and hearing Bridget's reaction is quite amusing. Along with this office relationship, Bridget is also dealing with the pressure from her mother to get married, while at the same time she is witnessing her friends gettting divorced. If that is not enough, she is also obsessed with her weight; to the point where she weighs herself everyday. I cannot help but wonder if this is what life is actually going to be like. <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of the book is the relationship she has with a fellow co-worker. She is constantly unsure about whether or not he likes her. One night they would have a date and the next day she would be unsure about the status of their relationship, giving the book a light hearted soap opera like feel, just with less drama. <br />Although Bridget's daily calorie and weight counts begin to get annoying, they simply add to her obsession. Her character does get a bit annoying at times because of her obsession with meaningless things, but the reader grows so attached to her character that you still feel for her when she is in these painful situations. You cannot help but to relate to Jones' character in one aspect or another; her concern about her weight, her addiction to lottery tickets, orher paranoia of relationships. Every situation she encounters seems to end up in some type of comic ending. Her insecurities and obsessions tie together perfectly to make it a book worth reading. <br />
1559408758|5.0|is the closest bottomline I can draw for this film. Made in 1984, This is Spinal Tap is a great mockumentary that shows the rise and fall of a great but imaginary band. It represents bands of all times, and no band at all. Anyone who listens to, or has any vague idea of classic Rock 'n' Roll, would see their parody from The Beatles to Ozzy Osburne at some points in the movie. I particularly love the parody with their early song \\"Flower People\\".    The characters are well-developed and realistic (if you're a rocker you may agree with this more =)). They say funny things and do ridiculous actions. Some of the jokes are real close to hitting \\"dumb\\" but it gracefully misses. Laughs are inserted everywhere throughout the film, though again, it's better if you know some rock 'n' roll knowledge to get the laughs.    Criterion disc contains an extra of 60-minute cut scenes add alternative \\"footage\\" and further completes the story with more laughs. It is long out-of-print but it's the definitive edition of this great movie. Get it if you can. But hey, enough of my yakkin', what'd ya say? Let's boogie!
B00006GEXQ|5.0|After viewing the film, About a Boy, the song \\"Killing Me Softly\\" is bound to take on new meaning. Hugh Grant's character, Chase, is a low life heir who has nothing better to do with his time than shop and watch television. In the beginning of the film, Chase goes on a number of dates, which all end in a comical matter. However, all of his relationships are meaningless until he meets a single mother and her son. Being the self-centered man that he is, he is drawn to her motherly qualities.  When this woman breaks up with him, he decides to go to a meeting for single parents, while pretending he is a single father. While there, he meets a woman who has a single daughter and makes a date with her. When he arrives at her house there is another young boy there whom she is babysitting.  <br />The boy soon discovers that Chase has no children and threatens to tell the woman if Chase doesn't spend time with him. Not knowing what to do, Chase agrees. Meanwhile, Chase and the other woman break up, Chase tries to let the boy go, but the boy is persistent in arriving at his house everyday after school. As their relationship develops, Chase helps the boy get through all his teenage problems, from girls, to his suicidal mother.  The outcome of their relationship leads to a hilarious ending, which would make anyone laugh, whether having seen the movie before or not. At first I was thrown, although amused, by his character's ignorance but by the end of film you couldn't help but love his character. <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|I read Nicholas Sparks books almost as soon as they come out.  And when I found out this one was being made into a movie I was skeptical because I loved the book!  But I went to see it anyway and cried and cried.  Especially the scene with the birds on the lake, those of you who have seen it know what I'm talking about.  And those who haven't MUST watch it.  It is a beautiful movie and I would recommend it to anyone, especially the skeptical ones.
B000002MP2|5.0|There is no better feeling than driving down the street on a summer day with the windows open belting out the words to your favorite Greenday song. \\"Longview\\" is a song about being lazy, a perfect song for a laid back day of driving around. While some might prefer their newer releases, it is hard to beat Dookie, one of their older CDs. This CD is known as bringing Greenday back to their punk roots. Their sound is similar to many modern day punk/rock sounds. The intros to each new song works perfectly with one another, it's almost as if the last song had never ended. One of the best songs on the CD is \\"Coming Clean\\", about a teenager and all that they have realized, making it easy for anyone to relate to. Perhaps, the best lyrics in the entire CD are, \\"Seventeen and strung out on confusion/Trapped inside a roll of disillusion\\" This song is about the stage in life when you realize that things are not as perfect as you like and you realize that there are major problems and struggles in life that everyone has to go through. Another song with a lot of meaning is \\"Welcome to Paradise\\", its about a guy who has been looking forward to being on his own for a long time and then ends up living in a dump. He realizes that being on his own is not as great as he thought it would be. <br />Although some of their lyrics are somewhat rude and at times insulting, the CD's sound makes it still worth listening to. Hearing the music just makes you want to get up and active. Another great song is \\"Emenius Sleepus\\", an upbeat song about an abruptly ended friendship.  However, there is one extremely odd, extra track called \\"All by Myself\\". The entire song is filled with the lead singer moaning about how he was all alone and nobody cared about him. Fortunately, that was an extra track, so if you turn the CD off soon enough, you won't even hear it. Even though not every track is perfect, the CD overall, has a very upbeat sound that is fun to listen to. <br />
B00005JMK0|5.0|HELP!! My venerable Beta tape copy of E.D. is just about reduced to tissue-paper thinness, so come on and let's have it available in a modern-day media format. One of the most enjoyable, albeit fantasmagorical, cinematic offerings, \\"Electric Dreams\\" is one of the all-time \\"feel-good\\" movies - one that can be understood and enjoyed by all family members from \\"anklebiters\\" to \\"wrinklies\\"!
B00003CWNR|5.0|Some people may find this film too philosophical, and then it is so condensed that some say it is unfocused.  <br /> <br />Yes, it talks about rules and laws, about morals. What is the point of laws and alternatively rules, if they are not helping those whom they are trying to help? It talks about sex impulse, about incest and abortion( in a forgiving way ), whether we should legalise abortion or whether we prefer more and more abandoned orphans grown up to be torn apart between the forces of the wish to find and show their biological parents how well they are now doing on the one hand, and \\"killing them\\" for abandoning them on the other, that is to say if they are lucky enough to get that far. How are they supposed to find their place in this world? Take note how Dr Larch prepared and launched Homer (and others: i.e. \\"Kings of New England\\") into this world. <br /> <br />So, once upon a time in a forlorn small place called Maine, there were some orphans who strived to survive and one of then chanced to intermingle with the folks in the fishing industry and the cider industry not too far away. A perfect fragment of this broken tiny Universe, a perfect elegy for Dr Larch.   <br /> <br />Well, this is more like a vivid watercolour painting of this part of the Universe with characters so round and so real; not just Dr Larch or Homer, but also the Lieutenant and his girlfriend (Charlize Theron), and even the two Roses. The watercolour effects are well deployed. The sights of the operation theatre(s) full of apparatus with the pregnant women in bed would otherwise be too stupefying. Furthermore, there are so many scenes of premature deaths of the orphans and then the tragic ending of Mr Rose etc. Have they been depicted in the oil like \\"My Life as a Dog,\\" the impact would simply be too shocking. Moreover, the way how it is depicted now would suggest some sort of intransience, some kind of timelessness.   <br /> <br />All in all, the film is enchanting and thought provoking all at the same time.  I will soon come back to it for a second time comparing it in detail with \\"My Life as a Dog\\" by the same director.

B00003CXBK|5.0|One of the darkest and most intense Studio Ghibli masterpieces, \\"Princess Mononoke\\" is every bit as vast and grand as \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" and rivals fellow Ghibli fare like \\"Castle In the Sky\\" and \\"Spirited Away\\" in memorabilty and array of character (both human and nonhuman), creature and concept.  The film's character cast is headed by Mononoke, a wolf-raised girl involved in the resistance of animals and nature against the ever-encroaching and ever-dominating human civilization, and Ashitaka, afflicted with a life-draining malady and on a quest deep into the remaining forest to find the elusive cure.  Being a Miyazaki-directed feature, \\"Princess Mononoke\\" still manages to easily blend in large amounts of beauty, cuteness and charm into the darkly serious and often violent story of conflict.  The struggle between relentless human industrialization & expansion and the vanishing natural world is a common theme in many Ghibli movies, but seldom presented in such a warlike and apocalyptic fashion.  Interestingly, it does this without demonizing the encroaching human factions.  As in our world, in this admittedly less technologically advanced world, the enivirornmental decimation isn't always caused by a burning malicious desire to eradicate our planetmates, but out of - what?  Arrogance?  Honest ignorance?  Unconscious apathy?  A defeatist attitude that it's all going to be plowed over anyway so why bother trying to delay the inevitable?  Unfortunately, it's the other 99.999% of species that have to suffer the bulk of the consequences.  In \\"Princess Mononoke\\", the 99.999% are in the early stages of not taking things lying down anymore, and are being aided by some very powerful entities, and the result is one of cinema's greatest epics, aided by impeccable animation and great voice acting flawlessly synchronized into the movie.  Complete in itself but still feels unfinished - \\"Princess Mononoke\\" is one of the great originals of all time, and now allwe can do is treasure it while we wait and hope for a \\"Princess Mononoke II\\" to come and be one of the great sequels of all time.
B00005JMXX|2.0|The 2 stars are for the f/x which were, for the most part, great. However the rest of the film is just one big, sloppy mess.  Dumb story, horible dialogue, overwraught direction. This flick has some good folks in it too - it's a shame they are terribly wasted.  Maybe if you watch it drunk.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a fan of Green Day for years, since I was in about 5th or 6th grade (I'm a sophomore in high school now.)  To me they were probably the gateway band into all the music I listen to (which is actually mostly classic rock.)  American Idiot, their new album, is absolutely excellent on so many levels.  From the opening song on it is a non-stop rock masterpiece.  The real gems on the album are Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday (A punk rock anthem if I have ever heard one,) St. Jimmy (which really sounds like a song off of Nimrod or Dookie) Letterbomb, and Homecoming (Rock and Roll Girlfriend is one of the catchiest things they've done.)  Totally awesome.  What is also unique about this band is that unlike many bands modeled after them, they can put on a brilliant live show.  I saw them on Halloween at the Patriot Center in DC.  They put on one of the best concerts I've ever seen.  Anyhow, if you don't own this album or any of Green Day's other stuff go right out and buy this.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is my favourite Pink Floyd album. As many others have mentioned, it does not have the sound of earlier Floyd albums... in fact, it doesn't really sound like any other Floyd album. It's dark and foreboding with three lengthy, moody numbers bookended by two short (almost identical) acoustic songs. The Pigs on the Wing songs are indeed very short, and some may consider them unnecessary. However, I feel they are enjoyable and required to break up some of the darkness of the rest of the album. Plus, part one enters perfectly into Dogs, my personal favourite song of the album. David Gilmour offers up some truly inspiring and emotional moments on the guitar. These make up one of his best performances, although many forget about it because of Comfortably Numb, Time and the like (which I agree are absolutely incredible as well). Pigs comes next, and this one is great because of the spectacular bass of Roger Waters. The opening bass riffs are eerie (featuring some excellent interplay with Richard Wright's organ) and the basslines throughout the song are thumping. Next is Sheep, which many enjoy and which appeared on the greatest hits. It is a very good song, with a driving guitar part and interesting interpretation of the \\"Lord is my shepard\\" bible passage. The lyrics of the album are a criticism of the social classes seemingly based on George Orwell's Animal Farm, and are biting and accurate even today. All in all, a superb album. It may not be something you can listen to every day because of how dark and dreary the overall feeling of the album is, but it is, in my opinion, Floyd's masterpiece that stands the test of time. Listen and enjoy.
B00063F8B2|5.0|The Polar Express is a soundtrack that will definitely get you in the Christmas spirit.  Everyone in the family will enjoy something on this CD.  I loved listening to the old Christmas songs on these album like Bing Crosby's White Christmas and Santa Claus is coming to town by Frank Sinatra.  The song  Silver Bells is also on this soundtrack.  I think that Silver Bells is one of the best Christmas songs ever written.  There is a terrfic  new song entitled Believe by Josh Groban on here.  This is a very uplifting song.  Josh Groban's voice is so smooth and soothing.  Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler is even on this CD.  His song Rockin on the Top of the World is a bit loud and fast paced, but I liked it anyway.  This song will get you moving though.<br /><br />Actor Tom Hanks is accompanied by some talented children  on the track Polar Express.  This is a very fun song that kids will love.  I think kids would also enjoy the song When Christmas Comes To Town.  This is a cute song performed by 2 kids with angelic voices.  I enjoyed this song very much.  Alan Silvestri contributes on this soundtrack by composing several beautiful instrumental pieces.  I especially liked the last track Suite from the Polar Express I also enjoyed the track Spirit of the Season also credited to Alan Silvestri which is performed by an awesome choir of singers.<br /><br />The Polar Express soundtrack is the best Christmas album I've heard in a long time.  It has a good mix of old and new songs.  I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys listening to Christmas music.
0060764864|3.0|The story is tightly written and very insightful.  The characters are well developed.  If I were rating the book, I would give it five stars.  However, I chose the audio edition, which does not do justice to the book.  The reader makes all of the characters sound drunk.  Her Southern and Black accents are terrible.  Her voice is so shrill and jarring that I have to continually readjust the volume.  If you can't manage the book version, skip it altogether.
B00063F8B2|5.0|WOW..okay, first I have to admit I didn't buy this CD on Amazon, I bought it at the CD store; I don't usually buy CD's online.  The whole soundtrack was FANTASTIC.  Of course, Josh Groban's 'Believe' is the best on there, I'm a HUGE fan of his and he put his all into that song, was very soft and beautiful, perfect for a Christmas album like this one.  I never knew Tom Hanks could sing, first of all, he was great, he has SO much energy; Steven Tyler is always the best at whatever he does, Rockin' on Top of the World was great.  The whole soundtrack was unreal; I'm so glad they included the old Christmas songs that we all grew up with, whether you're old or young.  All in all, this is a MUST buy for the Christmas season!
B000068IEU|1.0|I'd heard about this movie so much and it was all raving. I read the write up and it sounded good. So I watched it. I don't care if this was good in it's time, that's nice but someone trying to pick out a movie now who does not prefer cheap terrible low budget 70's horror B-movies would not enjoy this. It was shocking all right! I sat agape in disbelief at how awful the acting was, that these ugly, silly bad guys were so inconsistent in personality. One scene shows a brutal violence by these unfeeling fiends followed by these odd pensive looks of..\\"Hmmm... maybe we made a mistake, gee I think I feel bad.\\" and it was not at all genuine or believable. The parents, whoever they were played by are some of the worst actors I have ever seen. Sometimes it appeared people were having a hard time remembering their lines because the timing, the flow was all choppy. Ever heard of reshooting a scene and editing??  The music was to say the least inappropriate. The only light in this drastic darkness were the girls, the main character, Mari Collingwood was played by the only genuinely talented actor in the whole movie. If this movie broke new ground and by that led the way for other MUCH better films later to come then for that I am grateful as I am a very big horror genre fan. But that doesn't mean that it wasn't absolutely dreadful. I suggest that if you want something along the same lines but that is SO much better yet still is kind of dated, then watch \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\".
B00000IQW3|4.0|I've seen some comic strips in the past where 6 figure jobs were advertised for people who had skills in playing video games.  Can you break Space Invaders?  Great!  You get a $200,000 bonus!  Here is a movie with the following premise:  what if there really WERE pragmatic uses of video games?<br /><br />As it turns out, an arcade game called STARFIGHTER was actually put on Earth as a simulator of a real spacecraft (gunstar).  It was placed here to test the proper skills necessary to fight a nasty armada of fighters.<br /><br />The big score on the game is achieved by a high school kid who lives in a trailer park out in the middle of nowhere.  So, the aliens come to pick him up and \\"recruit\\" him for the mission they have designed for him.  That is to say, to fly a REAL gunstar against a REAL armada in order to save the universe.  Great fun!<br /><br />I remember in the mid 1980s the special effects in this film looked awesome.  Watching it 20 years later, most of the FX look almost pitiful.  However, it is still a fun movie even though most kids will find the effects almost insultingly bad.<br /><br />One of the biggest reasons to pick up this DVD is the lovely Catherine Mary Stewart.  I've always had a crush on her, and this was one of her earliest flicks.  It's nostalgic to see her high school aged as she's about the same age as myself.<br /><br />So, if you want a happy-go-lucky sci fi film, this one might be worth checking out.  If you're really big on FX, this one may disappoint.  However, it's such a feel-good movie that it's bound to please most people.
B00005K9LN|5.0|Judas Priest has never released a bad cd. In fact, they are one of the greatest metal bands of all time, and one of the first. British Steel has to be one the best album ever done by these guys.  Dave Holland's drum playing is excellecnt, and K.K. Downings and Glen Tipton's guitar playing is legendary.  Ian Hill is a good bass player whose playing can actually be heard. Halford's vocal's are absolutely badass.  You really need to look into this.
0446530891|5.0|I found this book to be very readable and suspenseful. I like the relationship this writer deals with. He is very good. I must admit being a PI I did deduce what the distraction was at the first presidential shooting even before the character was introduced. <br /> <br />This was my first Baldacci book but it has me wanting to read his other works. Keep it up Baldacci.
0385510438|1.0|This was my first Grsham and I was extremely disappointed with the entire book. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it might get better. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and missing nothing in the process. The characters are all completely forgettable, and so is the story. The end was predictable, and it was plain to see why the jurors were being eliminated.  Maybe I should give his early books a try but so far I am not impressed.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time.  It is a little different than A Perfect Circle's first release \\"Mer De Noms\\", but don't let that dissuade you from checking out this Cd.  The music on this album is exceptional and Maynard's voice has definitely grown over the years.  The best songs on the Cd are \\"The Noose\\", \\"Vanishing\\" (great bass), \\"The Package\\", \\"Pet\\" (nice and heavy, with a good message), and \\"Gravity\\".  The songs \\"Blue\\", \\"The Outsider\\", \\"Weak and Powerless\\", and \\"A Stranger\\" are solid tracks, but not quite as good as the others mentioned afore.  \\"Crimes\\" and \\"Lullaby\\" are little more than filler, and the song \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\", while still good, just seems a little out of place.  Overall, though, this Cd is a keeper, and I recommend it to anyone who likes high-quality music that makes you think.
B000002UAU|5.0|Considered by many as the single greatest album of all time, 1967's pseudo-concept album \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is as iconic as an album gets. After seriously pushing the pop music envelope with 1966's \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" goes even more all out.     The first side alone has theatrical hard rock (the title track), pop perfection (\\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\"), melancholy orchestral ballads (\\"She's Leaving Home\\"), anthematic rockers (\\"Getting Better\\"), carnival psychedelia (\\"Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\") and trippy harpischord romps (\\"Fixing a Hole\\").    Best of all is \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\", whose dreamy, druggy verses lead into a soaring, bubblegum pop chorus. It's a classic.     The second side is nearly as eclectic. There's lighthearted, vaudeville/music hall inspired pop (\\"When I'm Sixty Four\\"), Indian/Orchestral epics (Harrison's \\"Within You Without You\\"),  dreamy rock (\\"Lovely Rita\\"), and bitter rock (\\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\").     Most notable is The Beatles' pinnacle achievement, \\"A Day in the Life\\". A brilliant, avant-garde (for the time) composition employing dramatic tempo shifts, and an incredible orchestral build-up that culminates in a harrowing crescendo.    \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" is the Beatles' more colorful album. Although \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" are probably better song-wise, nothing creates a vibrant, one of a kind, unpredictable atmosphere like this. Another timless masterpiece that everyone should own.    Best Songs: A Day in the Life, With a Little Help From My Friends, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Within You Without You, Getting Better, Lovely Rita.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When I first popped this one in, I was expecting another Iowa. Well, I couldn't be more wrong. It was more melodic, no swearing, not as much screaming and heavy guitars, and...guitar solos. I had no idea Slipknot could play such kick ass guitar solos. Why did they hide that? Anyway, it wasn't Iowa, but it was still great. Here's the lowdown:<br />Prelude 3.0...5/5...Eerie feeling to this one. But cool. This one's a little slower. <br />The Blister Exsists...5/5...Amazing song. The whole song makes up for that snare solo that drags on in the middle of the song.<br />Three Nil...5/5...Cool song that's constantly changing. Never gets boring.<br />Duality...4/5...A good song. Before getting the album, I'd've given it a 5/5, but it doesn't stand out with the rest of the album. So, I only give it a 4. Still good though.<br />Opium Of The People...5/5...Screaming, then singing. Cool guitars.<br />Circle...5/5...Acoustic. Singing throughout the whole song. This was the song that completely convinced me that Slipknot wasn't going to start swearing again on this album. Great song though.<br />Welcome...4/5...Good, but doesn't stand out.<br />Vermilion...5/5...I heard this on Much Music and saw that the aired version was crap. Don't judge it by what you hear on the radio, its different , and worse, than the real version on the album.<br />Pulse Of The Maggots...5/5...Awesome Guitar Solo. Probably hardest song on the album. <br />Before I Forget...5/5...Easily the best song on the album. Great verses, chorus, and bridge. It all flows perfectly.<br />Vermilion Pt. 2...5/5...Acoustic version of Vermilion. Different lyrics. Amazing.<br />The Nameless...5/5...Screaming, then a love song chorus, then more screaming, the love song chorus again, more screaming, and then the chorus with distprtion. Great song.<br />The Virus of Life...2/5...Tollerable, if your deaf. I found this one boring, and dull. Skip it. The only Flaw on the album. <br />Danger - Keep Away...5/5...A great song thats too short.<br />In conclusion, if you are too closed minded to accept a different side of Slipknot, don't try it. But if your ready for a more melodic Slipknot, then pick it up. (But lets hope for another Iowa coming soon, I miss that style.)<br />Keep Shredding<br />Jack Metal
B000002KDS|5.0|While the Alice Cooper band's major-label debut, Love It To Death, was a predominantly lightly-produced affair, Killer takes the next progressive step complete with a brass section for the rock classic, \\"Under My Wheels,\\" and the multi-part, heavily layered 8-minute epic \\"Halo Of Flies.\\" <br /> <br />Killer's strength comes from timeless melody, flawless, simplistic, lyric, and top-notch rock vocal which by the end of the 3:30, witty, affair of \\"Be My Lover,\\" proves to be a classic, faultless formula. This carries through the short Spanish-flavored \\"Desperado,\\" the aformentioned \\"Halo Of Flies,\\" along with the tredging, almost hypnotic gritty rockers of \\"You Drive Me Nervous,\\" and \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.\\" The humor-soaked, lyrical darkness of \\"Dead Babies,\\" hit a chord lyrically with middle-age conservatives, while the extended conclusion that is the title track does a fair job of wrapping up an otherwise classic album that yells timelessness as loud as all of its other stories of drunken encounters and bad-ass desert crooks. <br /> <br />--- Jon Blanton 2004(C) cddude24@yahoo.com
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Some people just dont know good quality music when they see it. Keep in mind that this is a greatest hits album, meaning it has all the songs we've all heard on one Cd alone.  <br /> <br />You dont need to go out and spend more money on all the albums if you just want one or two of their most well known hits. Now you have them all together, and even some songs are added in to give it even more of a great sense to it, if that is even possible. <br /> <br />The best songs would have to be: <br /> <br />Paradise City: Great, great song, one of the most recognizable songs ing history. 6 minutes of great music <br /> <br />Live and Let Die: Another great song, and I really loved the guitar music in this. <br /> <br />Welcome to the Jungle: Have you seen the commercials for GTA, San Andreas? If so then you have to agree that this song goes with it quite nicely. I reccommend this song as the must hear for any of GN'R songs. <br /> <br />As for that guy who gave it one star, who cares if you know so much about GN'R? So do millions of other people, just ease up a little there. I would definately reccommend this, not everyone can see great quality work, even if it is in front of their eyes, so go out and buy it now

B0000B1OGD|5.0|I was first introduced to this movie watching \\"Who's Line is it Anyway?\\" They put Colin in front of \\"the blue screen\\" so that he had no idea what was behind him, and showed the rest of us Colin \\"reporting\\" while playing the scene where the cowboys are lassoing and hog-tying the pteradactyl. (Pardon my spellings.) Being a fan of the old-style animations, I just had to have a copy of this. <br />Others have given the basic plot outline, so I won't bother. I WILL say that my nephew and I thoroughly enjoy this one, probably for all the wrong reasons.  <br />As a party game, it's a great film to do your own version of \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\".
0316096199|5.0|In my opinion, I would recommend this book to all women. It is  life-changing and emotional. It makes you look at people differently and makes you doubt if our justice system really works. The book is basically about a young freshman in college who is raped and the book discribes her struggles and truimphs throughout the rest of her life. For example, it quotes in the book, \\"I live in a world where the two truths coexist; where both hell and hope lie in the palm of my hand.\\" This basically just sums up all that she has been through and all that she will have to cope with later. EVERY WOMEN NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK!

B00006ZXSK|3.0|I've been after this DVD for quite some time now, and kept bidding on it on Ebay, but it always went for outrageous prices. And someone always outbidded me at the last minute. So when I saw this for a reasonable price, I pounced on it. And it's one of those movies that just yell out to you to watch it straight away rather than those that sit there gathering dust, cos you can't bear to watch them - the two sequels to Mad Max, cos the first one was so bad!<br /><br />Drew Barrymore is a great actress in this, going from a little scruff, to almost a member of royalty. You laugh when she first hits the Prince with an apple (good shot!). You ache for her as her world seems to fall apart when Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) learns the truth. You cheer when she renders justice to her oppressors. Despite what other reviewers have said, her accent was certainly not the dodgiest, try Dougray Scott's accent! If you listen very carefully, his true Scottish accent doesn't quite manage to stay hidden.<br /><br />I would have definitely have rated this movie 4 out of 5 if it hadn't been for Dougray Scott. He is just missing something that makes a normal leading man so terrific. I didn't like him at all. And he didn't look like how I imagine Prince Charming to look when I was young. I can't put my finger on why I don't like him, or why he doesn't make a good leading man, it's just something strange.<br /><br />Anjelica Huston was great in the movie. She didn't quite have the evilness I was after, at times she was actually quite nice, especially when she told Danielle how much she looked like her dad. She also reminded me of the character (the name escapes me) she played in Mists of Avalon.<br /><br />There are some things I miss from the original Disney version. The fact that Cinderella & Prince Charming never really meet until the end, and he's supposed to find the woman he loves, and uses her glass slipper to find her. In this, Danielle does leave her glass slipper behind, but he already knows that. And then the Fairy Godmother is missing. But the addition of Da Vinci, if historically incorrect, is a nice twist on the Fairy Godmother.<br /><br />This is definitely a must have for all romantics at heart, and if you're a fan of Dougray Scott, then that's a bonus I suppose. Not for me.ut he already knows that. And then the Fairy Godmother is missing. But the addition of Da Vinci, if historically incorrect, is a nice twist on the Fairy Godmother. <br /> <br />This is definitely a must have for all romantics at heart, and if you're a fan of Dougray Scott, then that's a bonus I suppose.

B000001Y16|5.0|2Pac delivers another classic shortly after his unfortunate death.  This album delivers some of his finest songs to date.  Features the Outlawz on 4 of the 12 tracks.  Has some classic tracks and a few deep touching ones like he always does and does so well, as well as some hardcore gangsta $h!+.  It has 3 classics and no tracks worth skipping over.  Production is good and mostly handled by 2 people (Daryl Harper & Hurt-m-Badd each do 5 songs), and QD3 and someone else each do a track.  A definite must have for rap fans.  I wish he was still with us so all these fake a*s rappers wouldn't get the airplay or sales they get cause since him and BIG passed these watered down fags sell millions and get way too much airplay - that's why the rap game is messed up now.    #1 - 9 (f/ Outlawz)  #2 - 9 (f/ Edi Amin & Young Noble of Outlawz)  #3 - 9 (f/ K-Ci & JoJo)  #4 - 10 (classic f/ Val Young on the hook)  #5 - 7.5  #6 - 10 (classic f/ Outlawz)  #7 - 10 (classic deep song f/ Outlawz)  #8 - 9.5 (laid back song f/ Bad Azz)  #9 - 7  #10 - 9  #11 - 8.5 (f/ Tyrone Wrice on the hook)  #12 - 9 (talks about a lot of rappers - mainly Mobb Deep, Nas & Jay-Z)    b.

0920668372|5.0|My mother-in-law gave me this book at my baby shower before my <br />daughter was born 6 years ago and it made me tear up then and still makes me tear up.  I LOVE LOVE this book and so to does my daugther.  We read it every night before bed.  So you can imagine my replusion when I read some of the negative reviews.  Obviously these people who gave the negative reviews probably view alot of things inappropriately.  Please it is a simple caring well put book about a mother child relationship, love, stages of life, traditions, death and how life goes on.  A beautifully put book.  Please people look at it for what it is.  They must have some deep seeded issues to even think the thoughts they think when reading this book.  Maybe had their mother loved them unconditionally they would not be thinking these morbid thoughts.  And as for one person saying it was tramatic for her child at 2 because now when the mother becomes sick the child thinks the mother is dying come on first I have a 21 month old and he does not even understand and when he does the mother is old and sick remember much older and it is a part of life you can constructively explain that to your child if you accept and understand that death is a part of life. As much as it sucks and it's hard to deal with if you teach them and don't hide it from them they may be able to deal with it better.  It helped my daughter deal with the recent death of our family dog who was old and sick and it was just time.  This book helped her understand even with a pet's passing.  So for all you people who review this book negatively you may want to seek some help!!! As for people who are considering buying it was a great purchase and gift to me and it continues to be a great purchase that I now carry on and give!!!  It will be a book I will read to my grandchildren!!!  It is GREAT!!!

B0002S947K|5.0|Ritchie Havens. Otis Redding. Ryan Adams. Bob Dylan. Malcolm Holcomb. Jeff Buckley. I could go on and on like this, listing the ghosts in Ray's voice. Then there's a whole other cultural repertoire present in his lyrics just as broad. This is the tendency of audiences trying to assimilate something powerful and original, to grasp onto the known. But with a poststructuralist wink to LaMontagne, I suggest this center will not hold. If you're into great music, you'll get this right away. If you're into oblique referentiality and the structurality of structure, might I suggest an ironic reading of the lyrics? I think you'll find there's even more there to get. Hint: The signifiers might be off a few ticks from the signifieds.
B00001IVOF|4.0|Still in their early 20's at the time, Hav & P return with a solid follow up to their classic \\"The Infamous\\" album, 18 months later.  Features fellow QB rappers Big Noyd, Nas & 2 of the 3 members of the Infamous Mobb as well as Wu-Tang Clan members Method Man & Raekwon.  It has 4 classics, 2 near classics, but 3 songs that are only ok to keep it from a 5 star rating.  Production is good and done by Havoc.  Straight up gangsta sh*t on here, not no watered down candy-ass fake rap like most of the sh*t that comes out now-a-days.

B00000IN5G|5.0|This was the first COB album I bought, and I now own all of them. That should say something right there. Hatebreeder is SICK. Alexi is by far one of my favorites. Amazing. You hear something new everytime you listen to it, and that's for at least the first 40 times. Insane. Towards Dead End is the best song in my opinion. Buy this CD!
0735619670|5.0|I experienced many emotions, if that is the right word, whilst reading this book; a knowing smile, a nod, and sometimes shout, of agreement, disagreement and the occasional initial outright rejection. <br /> <br />I read on to find that often, a concept was contradicted by a counter argument, both equally valid, and it was impossible not to learn from each topic, even when an initial thought was along the lines of 'I know about this'. It really is thought provoking and teaches/re-teaches what should be basic principles, the most important of which are to be open minded, willing to learn and to strive for quality. <br /> <br />On top of all that I enjoyed reading it.  <br /> <br />I read a fair number of books during the course of a year and have to say this is one of the more useful and I will encourage its reading on my team.
B00005JNDX|5.0|i saw this movie at a sneak preview.  there was a line out the door an hour before the movie started.  i really enjoyed it.  it seemed as if the entire audience did.  it was very funny (embarrassing if you are Bridget).  It has all the same elements and people from the first movie.  If you enjoyed the first movie you will certainly enjoy this one.  I hate to say anymore and give away the movie, but it is safe to say if you are a Colin Firth fan, as I am, you will absolutely love this.
B000683VI4|5.0|I saw this film as the in-flight movie on my way back from Las Vegas to Pittsburgh on American Airlines last week. I generally fall asleep instead of watching the usual drivel shown on long flights. This was a red-eye flight and sleep was foremost on my mind. WRONG!!!!! I watched the first 10 minutes of this film and I was hooked! Even though it is a \\"chick-flick,\\" I was drawn into its tale of everlasting love and devotion between a lovely couple expertly portrayed by James Garner and Gena Rowlands. (Cudos and Oscar nominations should be given them!) I glanced around the plane and saw dozens of people equally fixated to their monitors watching this story unfurl (even the flight attendants were engrossed in the film between the usual beverage/snack service! It was the first time the film had been shown.) The scenes were beautifully filmed. Even though you can predict what will happen next, you can't wait for it to materialize on the small screen. The ending is the denouement of the whole story about the notebook! I won't reveal it but there were many sniffles heard on the plane and some quiet sobbing as well (both men and women!) FANTASTIC! As soon as it is released on DVD, I will buy a copy. It felt good to cry and see other men cry unashamedly about a true love as well. After all, we all need a good cry sometime -- either from joy or sorrow. This film elicits both. Make sure you have a good sturdy hankie or a large box of tissues handy -- you'll need it!!!
B00063MBU8|4.0|I dunno, I tend to be both highly opinionated and accepting of most music. Simple Plan is one of those bands. They're a guilty pleasure. I like the music, they have an amazing live set, and while they are so very juvenile (I'm 23, mind you) they just have this appeal that refuses to be denied. No Pads... was a fine cd, the songs a little derivative, but still a fine effort. I will not deny I still sing along to I'd Do Anything, and feel like punching a wall or jumping around when I hear Perfect (my folks were like that a lot, and still are), but if I need something with more substance, I would go elsewhere. <br /> <br />This album repeats what they did on their last one, they just do it better. It still has no substance, it is still derivative, and extremely juvenile...but during a year where their peers in Good Charlotte and Sum 41 tried to be serious for a change (Sum 41 succeeded btw), Simple Plan just stuck to what they do best, and in turn released a decent album that builds on their simple formula of music while not differing enough to alienate the fan base that made them famous. (If you really do wish to hear what they sound like when they're serious, track down a copy of Reset's No Limits or No Worries, Pierre and Chuck were in that band back in the late 90's). <br /> <br />Don't expect any new lyrics. Most of the songs are about being a kid and how much life sucks when you are. Welcome to my Life is this album's version of I'm Just A Kid. Shut Up is strangely remniscent of You Don't Mean Anything with a dash of Perfect thrown in. Jump is a single minded song that seems to be a mosh pit anthem and nothing more. Thank You is a revenge song, plain and simple, and I know there will be at least one kid out there who can relate (and probably more than one). <br /> <br />The difference is in HOW they play it. In the case of all the songs above, they manage the same subject matter, with infinitely better musicmanship. I'd rather listen to this cd's versions of thesame old than the last one's. While they may not have grown up (which is ok in my humble opinion), they certainly have progressed where it counts. If you can, tone out the songs and just listen to the music. You may find yourselves pleasantly surprised.
B000002WPI|5.0|The Wu comes out hard as a muthau#ka on this. This album revolutionized hip hop. It changed the way lyrics were delivered, it was hardcore gangsta $h!+, and it was well received. They were also the first to give each other a bunch of aliases. It Features a lot of the clansmen (except U-God & Masta Killa only on 1 or 2 of the tracks respectively). This group revoultionized the industry in the record deal sense, as the group was signed but all member could get solo deals on different labels with no contractual obligations. Has plenty of classic tracks on it and some dope production and no weak spots. 2 members have solos's (GZA & Method Man).

B000001DTM|5.0|Many have bashed this cd by saying that U2 changed their style way to much during this album. To survive in the music industry sometimes you have to change with the times and U2 definately pulled it off. I for one think that bono wearing the \\"clown makeup\\" is a very theatrical and edgy thing live in concert. The \\"clown makeup\\" is him protraying Mr Macphisto and I find it to be a very dark and moody part of the show. Now onto the cd.. This cd produced one of my top 3 favorite U2 songs and that song is Until The End Of The World it lets edge truly do his thing and the lyrics shift from very dark to an almost romantic feel. If one song on the cd showed you where U2 was truly going it is the song ZOO STATION.Zoo Station kind of stood out on the cd mainly because it doesnt really fit in to the cd at all it definately sounds like something that should have been on the POP album. ONE is probably one of the most powerful and edgy love songs of the 90's, it is definately a song that came from the heart of a truly great musician. The only 2 songs that i could gripe about would be Mysterious ways and Whos gonna ride your wild horses. Mysterious ways def has a good beat but the song drags on for WAAYY to long and the appeal eventually wears off. Whos gonna ride your wild horses might be the only song in history that turned me off just after i heard the first 2 seconds, the opening to the song is obnoxious at the least and although the song has its moments it overall is to sappy for my taste. Overall this is definately one of the greatest U2 records of all time and it is a must have for any U2 fan.<br /><br />  TOP 3 U2 ALBUMS<br /><br />  1.Under a Blood Red Sky<br /><br />  2.Achtung Baby<br /><br />  3.Joshua Tree
0380002930|5.0|I remember reading this over a period of about a month when I was in 7th grade and as soon as I finished it I went out to buy a copy of my own.  This is one of the 3 best books I have ever read.  It is about as mall group of rabbits whose regular home gets burned and demolished because of a new settlement being built.  They escape and go on a long journey and come across many circumstances (good & bad) to try and start their own colony elsewhere.  They lose or almost lose a bunch of their friends, pick up new friends (not just rabbits) and go to war with another rabbit colony all in the process of trying to start a new life and colony of their own.  That's a brief review of the book but I don't want to give the story away too much,  Get the book and read it you won't be disappointed.
078401213X|4.0|Yeah, this is one of those movies that you need to watch twice (BEWARE: this movie combines both black  & white film w/ techno beats in the background!). But it's interesting, fast-paced and very clever.<br /><br />From Darren Aronofsky (who directed the REQUIEM FOR A DREAM masterpiece), this is another great indie film of his. I won't go into the plot -- you can read the editorial's review for that -- but this is a great film to watch. You may or may not like it, but watch it nonetheless.
068987474X|1.0|...a high-powered publicist + Oprah + The Today Show = instant bestseller.  The only thing more simple than that math is the book.  <br /> <br />
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Recently, I just watched this movie after getting my Unlimited Blockbuster Rental account (which allows me to rent movies that I wouldn't normally spend four dollars on), and I must say, this is a gem.<br /><br />It's so different from any other mainstream movie out there today, but in a good way. I'd definetly reccomend this to anyone out there who wants to watch a good movie. Plus, it includes talent from actors such as Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Jena Malone (one of my new favorite rising stars). So, go see it, you won't be dissapointed.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is the \\"London Calling\\" for this generation..  One of the most blistering political albums of all time.  Easily  the best album of the year.  It's so ironic that I didn't hear it until November 3rd..  I put it in & just about bauled my brain out..  YES!!!!!!!!! ..is all I could muster.  This most definatly ranks up there with The Who's-Tommy, The Clash's-London Calling & Bob Dylan's-Freewheelin'!!!!!! <br />Unbelievable substance & energy!!!!
1565123875|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about reading this book. After a few pages, I immediately identified with the character and fell in love with her innocence and ready to please behaviour.  I felt a little nostalgic with her description of the towns and the people, especially the women. Having visited Enugu and Nsukka lots of times. It is a great book, the words just jump out and hug you, ezioku.
0451169514|5.0|I have only read half of the book so far, and can already discuss its brilliantness.  <br />As opposed to some other reviews I've read here, I can easily read books like this one without lights on. I don't know; I even watched \\"The Ring\\" alone and it didn't get to me at all. I enjoy horror on some weird level that other people can't do. <br />That's why I thought this was one of the most amazing horrors ever written.  <br />However, IT is mostly scary by the actual images and scenes it displays. Some people are more scared when being described something that is so perverse it scares them, such as some parts of \\"The Shining\\" the movie, when the main character gets stuck in a picture from long ago. Now that's scary. <br />Over, the book is wroth every word of it, because that's SK's best power: to make every single word worth the book as a whole. Don't think too much of it: it'll be wroth your time. I guarantee it... heheheh.
0812550757|5.0|The news reached Ender instantly: the \\"piggies\\" were murderers. The new sentient species on the planet Lusitania were just as the formics \\"buggers\\" were three thousand years ago. They were unknown in practices. Why did they kill the scientists that had grown so close to them? Speaker for the Dead, by Orson Scott Card, is intense, with the murder mystery thing going on, but on another plane, very sentimental.  <br />The story revolves around the subplot of the Ribeira family and their hurt that Ender heals with his speaking. Ender is a speaker for the dead, but also the Speaker for the Dead: the one who wrote about the buggers and made people love and understand them after the initial fear had passed away with time. This was what he did with his speaking of people as well. Ender planned to write something similar about the piggies, but also to redeem himself. He had also been the one to almost commit Xenocide: He killed all of the buggers except one cocoon, which he kept to place on a world some day. Through it all, Ender also somewhat redeems his parents, in that he became the father he wanted. The Ribeira family became his own, as crazy as it seemed to the townsfolk. The Ribeiras were distant, cold, yet hurting, as mentioned before. Ender changed the lives of Novinha and her six children forever. <br /> This book was also great on another level: Card's writing style is plain, yet powerful as truth. Card knows truth (about humans at least) and as a result, this entire story seems very real. It is something one can get really immersed in. I believe that, above all, Card wanted a story that did just that: a book that is real, and fun to the reader. I think that Card wrote the story he wanted. It was what I wanted, anyway.  <br />
B00005JMXX|3.0|This isn't the worst movie ever made.  It is actually quite engrossing and entertaining.  The CGI effects (overall) are some of the best and most effective I have ever seen in a movie of this type.  The acting is solid especially by Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal.  Although the script dialogue wise isn't always up to snuff but this isn't Shakespeare we're talking about here. The set up sequence for the film in the beginning is kinda weak effects wise but not awful.  There is a Dick Cheney character that is interesting and most of the supporting cast is quite good.  The problem with the film and what made me keep it from a five star rating is that it introduced emotionally effective characters like Ian Holm (LOTR, Alien, From Hell) and Adrian Lester (Primary Colors) in the beginning and then dropped them like a hot potato about halfway through the film without any real closure to their subplots.  And this is really the weak link of the film.  But if you can get beyond that I think you will find this film rather enjoyable.  It has to be viewed in comparison to other films of its type in terms of being fairly critical of it like ID4, Emmerich's version of Godzilla, Earthquake, the Airport series and The Towering Inferno.  It isn't better than Towering Inferno in my opinion but it is much better than all those others.  ID4 does have that closure though with all of the supporting characters so it is certainly up for debate.  I give this 3 1/2 out of five.
B000002GQG|4.0|After \\"Days of Future Passed,\\" with its fusion of progressive rock and the London Festival Orchestra the Moody Blues provided more of the same, only different (i.e., a Mellotron instead of the full symphonic orchestra since Decca did not want to pay for another one despite the success of the aforementioned previous album).  On their 1968 release \\"In Search of the Lost Chord,\\" the songs are shorter and manage to involve both pop and Eastern influences.  \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" could be one of the best Hollies song never done by the Hollies.  However, the exception that proves the rule here would be \\"Legend of a Mind,\\" the song that causal listeners think is called \\"Timothy Leary\\" or \\"Timothy Leary's dead,\\" or something along those lines:<br /><br />Timothy Leary's dead.<br />No, no, no, no,<br />He's outside looking in<br /><br />Now that Timothy Leary is not only dead but really, most sincerely dead listening to \\"Legend of a Mind\\" from is a different experience.  Leary died in 1996 and his remains were cremated and lauched into the final frontier along with those of \\"Star Trek\\" creator Gene Roddenberry.  The song is associated with the psychadelic period of the Sixties, although it is hard to imagine why given that the lyrics are full of unqualified praise for Timothy Leary and his astral plane:<br /><br />He'll take you up, he'll bring you down,<br />He'll plant your feet back firmly on the ground.<br />He flies so high, he swoops so low,<br />He knows exactly which way he's gonna go.<br /><br />Ray Thomas wrote \\"Legend of a Mind\\" and also \\"Dr. Livingston I Presume,\\" the other song on the album that makes acid trips sound like a good idea, in that delightfully eccentric way that make the British so endearing.  You keep wanting to suspect that there is something tongue-in-cheek going on here, but, no the group seems to be earnest in its adoration as the CD's new notes by the band members.  No wonder the Moody Blues were so popular with the counter-culture.  Add to this the Eastern influences that pop up at the end of the album in \\"Visions of Paradise\\" and \\"Om.\\"  Things get a little self-indulgent on this album, but the experimentation pays off big time with their next effort, \\"On the Threshold of a Dream.\\"<br /><br />In 1968 the Moody Blues, which is a much better name than El Riot & the Rebels, consisted of Justin Hayward (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, 12-string guitar, sitar, harpsichord, piano, Mellotron, bass, percussion, tablas); Mike Pinder (acoustic guitar, cello, autoharp, harpsichord, Mellotron, piano, bass); John Lodge (acoustic guitar, cello, bass, tambourine, snare drum, background vocals); Ray Thomas (C flute, alto flute, soprano saxophone, background vocals); and Graeme Edge (piano, drums, timpani, tambourine, tablas).  The point of detailing all this instrumentation is to evidence that the level of experimentation here was at least the equal of what the Beatles were doing during their legendary \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" period (and Jethro Tull only had one flute).  The result was that \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\" made it to #23 on the Billboard chart.  There were two singles released, \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" made it to #61 and \\"Never Comes the Day\\" only got to #91 (A pair of Justin Hawyard songs, \\"Voices in the Sky\\" and \\"The Actor,\\" were both released in the U.K. as singles), and to make sure everything is dotted and crossed, the cover art was by Phil Travers.the album in \\"Visions of Paradise\\" and \\"Om.\\"   Things get a little self-indulgent on this album, but the experimentation pays off big time with their next effort, \\"On the Threshold of a Dream.\\"    In 1968 the Moody Blues, which is a much better name than El Riot & the Rebels, consisted of Justin Hayward (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, 12-string guitar, sitar, harpsichord, piano, Mellotron, bass, percussion, tablas); Mike Pinder (acoustic guitar, cello, autoharp, harpsichord, Mellotron, piano, bass); John Lodge (acoustic guitar, cello, bass, tambourine, snare drum, background vocals); Ray Thomas (C flute, alto flute, soprano saxophone, background vocals); and Graeme Edge (piano, drums, timpani, tambourine, tablas).

B00005HEF0|5.0|\\"L.A. Woman\\" is the final album put together by the Doors before the death of Jim Morrison and what is so striking about it for me is how the two best tracks, the title one and \\"Riders of the Storm,\\" are so different from the rest of what is on the album. Contrasting the start of those tracks with the opening song on the album, \\"The Changeling,\\" and they are like night and day. Most of the rest of this 1971 album is really blues oriented, with \\"Love Her Madly\\" clearly being the best of the bunch, and some of the rest being instantly forgettable. I think it is obvious that the band was trying to get back their credibility after veering too far in the direction of pop for a couple of albums, with \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and this one righting those wrongs. But since a few of these songs are pretty forgettable, \\"L.A. Woman\\" is an album that is caught between a 4 and a 5 but you have to round up given how good its two best songs end up being.<br /><br />My two favorite parts of Oliver Stone's movie \\"The Doors\\" is when we hear Ray Manzarek in the background fooling around on the organ until he gets the bit for \\"Light My Fire\\" right and the end credits with the tracking shot showing the record of \\"L.A. Woman,\\" with Val Kilmer's Morrison taking advantage of the great acoustics in the bathroom. For years when I was driving back from the Twin Cities and coming up the final hills before being able to see the lights of home, to wit the \\"city of lights,\\" \\"L.A. Woman\\" was the song I would play in the car because it perfectly suited the moment.<br /><br />Since the track opens with the sound of an accelerating car engine it is easy to see why the songs is associated with driving. Robbie Krieger simulates that sound on his guitar, but with a hint of eeriness that leads into first Manzarek's keyboards and then John Densmore's cymbal tapping and session player Jerry Scheff's throbbing bass. From that intriguing beginning the song generates its compelling rhythm and allows Morrison to wax lyrical. The bridge represents one of the most creative changes in rock history, using a tango tempo while Morrison sings about burning hair before getting to the final section where the anagrammatic \\"Mr. Mojo Risin'\\" makes his appearance. On a lot of these tracks Morrison's voice sounds about shot, but there are no complaints about \\"L.A. Woman,\\" which qualifies as his last great vocal performance.<br /><br />\\"Riders of the Storm\\" is one of the moodiest Doors' songs and the lyrics create a sense of foreboding (e.g., \\"Into this house were born/Into this world we're thrown\\") representing the questionable side of human existence. Musically Manzarek captures the sound of the storm, with actual thunderstorm sound effects dubbed on to the track, while Densmore again works the cymbals and Scheff provides a simple bass line, reflecting a minimalist approach that is quite effective. The song made it to #14 on the Billboard charts after Morrison's death in Paris (\\"Love Her Madly\\" had made it to #11 while the title track was just too long for AM radio). The \\"L.A. Woman\\" album only made it to #9, which, believe it or not, makes it the worst performance by a Doors album. Of course, a decade later Morrison and the Doors were bigger than ever and \\"L.A.

B000002H2H|5.0|This is the first of Metallica's three classic albums (Kill 'Em All was good but a little rough around the edges) and in my opinion it's their best. Why? Because it has the best songs, simple as that! <br />Every song on this album is fantastic from the blistering thrash metal of the opener \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" through to the progressiev instrumental closer \\"Call of Ktulu\\". Ride the Lightning has no weak points and in \\"Creeping Death\\" it has what is in my opinion Metallica's greatest track ever. Anyone who has heard this song's riff live will know what I'm talking about! Other highlights include the instrumental passage in the title track which is just awesome with some great soloing.  <br />When you listen to this you really wonder how Metallica could have gone so awry following the Black album. This feeling is emphasized when you see them live and they once again become the greatest band on the planet. Then you get back home and remember about Load and St. Anger. Oh well, maybe we should just be grateful that we have this and their other 80s albums to enjoy. <br />
B00003TL49|5.0|Fiona Apple returns in rare form in \\"When the Pawn...\\" (plus about ninety more words), her sophomore album -- and one of the rare ones that actually improves on the first. Her passionate bluesy-jazzy sound is blended with her strong, sensitive vocals and one soul-baring song after another.<br /><br />\\"Hell don't know my fury.\\" You said it, Fiona. Anger and melancholy permeate her songs, including the rage of \\"Limp\\" (\\"But no matter what I try/You'll beat me with your bitter lies\\") and the restrained quality of piano-bombast \\"The Way Things Are.\\" Even the musically gentle \\"I Know\\" has a deep sadness, starting to move past some of the bitterness and anger coming before it, and early on Apple seems to apologize for her romantic shortcomings. There are also two additional tracks: the powerful Beatles cover \\"Across the Universe,\\" from the movie \\"Pleasantville,\\" and the haunting ballad \\"Never is a Promise,\\" which doesn't immediately blend in, but works wonderfully and subtlely.<br /><br />Female singer-songwriters are a dime a dozen today, but few of them do much more than set basic pop songs to acoustic guitar and piano. But Fiona Apple forges ahead with a noncomformist attitude and strong songs. In a nutshell, she comes across as an excellent musician, with all the power you'd expect from such a singer. And every song is a winner, gut-wrenching and beautiful in its intensity.<br /><br />Musically, it has almost as much impact as her writing does. The music is often led by Apple's piano -- not tinkly piano, but dark, fast melodies that match her songs in rhythm and intensity. Percussion booms in songs like \\"Limp,\\" as if giving vent to Apple's feelings. And cropping up from time to time are odd gurgles and squiggles, as well as some well-blended horn arrangements in the background.<br /><br />Apple's voice is strong and assured, but it also has that rare quality of expressing vast amounts of emotion. Without, I might add, sounding overwrought. Which, since the mood is that of an Angry Young Woman, is a hard thing to pull off, but Apple's richly poetic lyrics (\\"And you can use my skin/to bury secrets in\\") make her songs seem intensely personal.<br /><br />\\"When the Pawn...\\" is an almost exhausting experience -- just try listening to the whole thing without getting your heart rate up. From rotten lovers to personal pain, Fiona Apple explores the bitter side of love... and despite its bitterness, it's a gem.since the mood is that of an Angry Young Woman, is a hard thing to pull off, but Apple's richly poetic lyrics (\\"And you can use my skin/to bury secrets in\\") make her songs seem intensely personal.   <br />   <br />\\"When the Pawn...\\" is an almost exhausting experience -- just try listening to the whole thing without getting your heart rate up.

B000062YAZ|5.0|...that hasn't been said before? Just amazing. Flawless from start to finish. Greatest Thrash Metal album of all time? It's a strong contender for THE greatest Metal album of all time. You cannot seriously call yourself a fan of Metal if you do not own this album. 'Nuff said. <br /> <br />Just one note to \\"I Fed MyButt\\": you cite Slipknot as an example of a band you like. Please note that without this album there would be no Slipknot. Or a large proportion of the metal around today for that matter. <br />
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Where was I when Nightwish put out their first album?  Someplace stupid apparently.  When a friend bought it on a whim and played it at work, he didn't like it andshut it off after the first track. <br /> <br />Very stupid man.  The next day, I went out and bought my own copy.  Brillant, Wow, Amazing...are VERY WEAK WORDS to discribe how incredable this album is.  I feel I'm listening to a rock opera a la THe Who's Tommy, but better (sorry!) <br /> <br />THis group REALLY needs to hit it big in the US.  If only to prove that good music, good quality music doesn't have to be classical.  And shove the Rap and Britney Spears off the charts. <br /> <br />Get it - Love it (you will!) - and Pass it on!
B000001Y5J|4.0|This album highlighted a major style change for Nine Inch Nails. Prior to this the band style was almost snyth pop. Trent Reznor basically wanted to create an album sound that was true to the band's blistering live performances. <br />One thing that is plainly obvious about this album is that Trent was not very happy when he wrote it. Anger is directed outwards at everyone and everything but even more so it is directed inward. Just check out these lyrics from \\"Last\\": \\"look through these blackened eyes, you'll see ten thousand lies, my lips may promise but my heart is a wh*re\\". Trent may be well known for his self deprecating lyrics but nowhere are they as vitriolic as they are on here. <br />As far as the music goes, it is brutal and heavy, basically combining metal, punk and industrial. Although guitars are recognizable, the sounds are all electronically enhanced and distorted. The album is probably as long as it needs to be and is certainyl not on the same level as Trent's masterworks \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"Fragile\\". But if you're ater a short and sharp dose of self loathing, look no further.
B00005UKE0|5.0|It is difficult for me to explain my feelings towards this awesome, shattering album of music. Mr. Harrison put his heart and feelings into his music, pure and simple, and I can appreciate and respect the thought and care that must have gone into these songs.  I also understand that this may not be for everyone.  You'll have come to a place in your life where you can recieve it.  That's it. Every song touches you, and that is brilliance.
B00006WKY9|5.0|I originally had this as an album, brought from Japan by my girlfriend in 1980. Now its avail on CD and is awesome. \\"We'll Burn the Sky\\" is one of the best Scorps songs in their storied history, and they have cranked it out on their last couple of tours....hopefully this year as well. It is Ulrich Roth's last studio album as Scorps guitarist...buy it.
B00000634J|5.0|John Lennon put himself into his music so well and effectively that you feel as if you know him very well (of course, you don't).  I feel that this is the reason why so many people were so upset when he died, he was kind of like family. Now, the music on this CD is his best work and is perfect for anyone who wants to begin to listen. However, I promise it will whet your appitite for more. All of his solo albums from Plastic Ono Band to Double Fantasy are quite excellent. Check these out, too.
B0002858YS|5.0|this is a fantastic cd. i bought it a while ago and never really listened but i threw it in today and just found it very pleasing to my ears. all the songs sound great but the exception is somebody told me becasue the radio is the ultimate death of good music. my favorites are smile like you mean it, mr. brightside, number five, and number eight. also, the bass like in \\"jenny was a friend of mine\\" is just sick. it makes the song great. this is a 10/10 cd for sure.
B00005JN7O|2.0|I guess the main appeal of this movie is the way it is filmed. It has that old 60s classic look and feel. Like those old TV series with the tin foil robots. I suppose that's meant for nostalgic effect but probably not a compelling reason to go see a movie. I mean, if you have color, USE color! In the end, it just made me feel kind of dizzy.  <br /> <br />The CGI graphics are 2nd rate and the story is not very interesting. Maybe it would've been better if we got to see a Totenkopf. This movie is pretty short so not great value for your money although I'm not sure it would've been a good thing to make it any longer. Escepecially when I'm not particularly a fan of Jude Law nor Gwyneth Paltrow.  <br /> <br />Having said that, the movie does have its moments and I do like Angelina Jolie, although I'm not sure why you would cover half her face with an eyepatch. Overall, still an okay movie to watch.
1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone is a 15 year old with Asperger's Syndrome.  He loves being alone, can hardly bear it when he's physically touched, and cannot relate to people - socially and emotionally - in normal ways.  He also possesses a sharp head for math and sciences, loves computers, and among all the different kinds of novels out there, enjoys mysteries the best - the best ones are like puzzles. <br /> <br />From page one of the book, Christopher stumbles upon a mystery of his own - on one of his nighttime walks he discovers his neighbor's dog impaled on a gardening fork.  This makes Christopher sad (for he likes dogs a great deal) and also sparks his curiosity; he thinks of himself as a detective and begins to write a book (the book you are reading) about his exploits.  In the search for the dog's murderer, he discovers things that will turn his world upside-down, and he will be forced to do things that are unimaginably difficult for a boy with his condition. <br /> <br />I loved this book.  First off, it's told entirely from Christopher's perspective, and the voice and the thoughts and feelings of the character are so in keeping with his condition.  What's more, even though you don't see things through the eyes of the other characters, you can still see the other characters (especially Christopher's dad) come to life; and though Christopher doesn't quite get why they behave the way they do, we understand.  Christopher's dad, his sole caretaker at the start of the novel, is a figure that will stir a great range of emotions in you. <br /> <br />The novel is ironic, funny, painful, and deep.  Bravo to Mark Haddon for never sinking to cheap sentimentality or cliches.  This is a superb book, not only for what it shows us about Asperger's Syndrome, but for what it reveals about humans in general, \\"normal people\\" and their problems, complexities, and craving for love. <br /> <br />
0783225199|4.0|It was ok for very comely Carrie Fisher's character to shoot at Jake and Elwood and blow up a store window but when she destroys the whole boarding house they live in that was just horribly gratutious on the writer's part and overblown (no pun intended). Another unnecessary bit comes when the Nazis car plummets in Chicago and (unnecessary bit) there's some fag talk between the nazis. Outside of these wrong bits it's a perfect film.
B00005K3NR|2.0|Carrie was NOT scary, once again stephen Kings novel was better than this movie. I only enjoyed the ending wen the pigs blood was poured on her, because it was the only good and funny part of the whole movie, my advise is to see the remake...its way better. *~SMG FAN~*
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|I remember waking up REALLY early back in the summer of 85 to catch this once in a lifetime event. Watching the concert on the local tv station as they switched from the English concerts to the American concerts, and then watching ABC's \\"version\\" of the concert in prime time will always be imprinted on my memory. Watching all of these diverse musical artists, warts and all, I understood what it must have been to be at Woodstock. After reading all of the reviews, I still think that there should be a COMPLETE version of the concerts, with every act represented, regardless of how good or bad they are. How about releasing three box sets: one version being the complete show from England, a second version the complete show from Philadelphia, and a third with both versions. Granted, the last would be a HUGE box set, but it would be worth it to this music fan to see all of these great and not so great artists playing for a great cause. <br /> <br />It's sad to read that some artists do not want their performances to be placed on these DVD's. I haven't heard any stories as to why they wouldn't want to be involved, but until then, i would rather watch my almost 20 year old video tapes of the performances (and listen to my cassettes taped from radio broadcast) than to have a \\"greatest hits\\" DVD of this monumentous event. Hopefully someday we will get the LONG version of Live Aid, but until then, i'm glad my VCR still works.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I knew I wouldn't be disappointed with Avril's new c.d. when it came out. I was actually quite moved with this c.d. because I think Avril opened up more on this album. With the songs such as 'How Does It Feel', 'Nobody's Home', and 'Happy Ending' reaches deep into many women's hearts, for we have all experienced what she sings out. She speaks out to all women about the problems all women face. The isolation of being different, the shock and pain we feel when we find out our Prince Charming is a true toad, and just the confliciting feelings of always seeing the image of a perfect woman and it not fitting your true personality. But then she blends her true, I- don't- care feelings through the songs 'Don't Tell Me' and 'Who Knows', with a personal moment of tenderness with her songs like 'Fall to Pieces' and 'Slipped Away'.  <br />I believe Avril is a good voice for women, unlike so many other new female singers out there that only speak of how cute their boyfriend is and how great they look in jeans you can't even breathe in. Most of all, Avril sings about the true things we young women go through, and tells us in this world we women need to be tough as well as sweet if we want any sort of respect. Avril is one of my most favorite singers, and I indeed recommend this c.d. to all, especially the young women of the world.

0380789019|2.0|I leapt into this book on the recommendation of a friend, having never read anything by Neil Gaiman. Being a pretty big fan of sci-fi/cyberpunk, the premise sounded right up my alley, and it started out rather well. Even 100 pages in I was ripping through the book, smiling and intrigued, but soon after that the disappointment began to settle around me like a legendary London fog... <br /> <br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br />With alternate reality books like these, world-building is key. For readers new to the genre, the vast kingdom of 'London below', (essentially a murky, underground, quasi-real parallel to the regular London)in which much of the events chronicled in 'Neverwhere' take place, might seem brilliant. The thing is, as an idea, it had real potential, but FAR too much was left unexplained. For example, at one point during his adventures, the protagonist, Richard, stops asking questions--questions on which I was also completely hung up--as he begins to accept the fact that no one's going to give him much in the way of a direct answer. For some reason, Gaiman decided to put the reader in the exact same boat, and the result was extreme dissatisfaction, at least for me. In this way, I can see why the book is being compared to the classic children's story 'Alice in Wonderland', as that was the problem with a lot of alternate world fairytales as well: the stories were great, but they were told with nary a modicum of concern for rhyme or reason. We accepted this as kids--face it, we weren't as smart back then--but adults with the same lust for the fantastical start to demand more solid explanations for things, more detailed descriptions, more questions answered, and thus spawned the world-building found in classics of science fiction and fantasy. (Dune, anyone?) <br /> <br />This is not to say that everything in science fiction and fantasy must make perfect sense according to our natural laws and facts about our own universe we believe to be true. Many great stories break all the rules, and that's the second task for the author--to build a given world, and then construct events in such a way that they make sense within the context of this world. The 'London below' of 'Neverwhere' did have rules, but they simply were not developed enough. The rules and events that took place within the world of 'London below' governed by these rules appeared to be completely arbitrary--for instance:  <br />1. Market truce <br />2. Half-lives of Iliaster & Lear (WHY? HOW?) <br />3. Specialized abilities (Rat-speakers, Door, Croup & Vandemar) <br />4. Darkness on the bridge???? <br />5. Mechanism that brought the marquis de Cabaras back to life <br />6. Richard AND Jessica's ability to see Door <br />7. Mechanism that brought Richard into London below (at least we were told how he got back!!) <br />8. Divisions of 'London below'--why was it organized into baronies & fiefdoms?  <br />9. Immortality of several characters, but not all? <br />10. RICHARD'S ORDEAL!!! To some it might have seemed self-explanatory, but it wasn't. It was a half-baked idea at best, waiting to be cultivated into a magnificent turning point in Richard's journey. Nothing about the ordeal or why on earth Richard got through it made any sense. That goes for the rest of his triumphs: why was HE so special?? <br /> <br />Etcetera! <br />  <br />Another reader equated this book with the phrase \\"rough draft.\\" I must say, I agree! As a first copy, this novel has thrilling potential. Yet, as it stands, it's forgettable, simplistic and lazy. <br /> <br />This brings me to the main characters--same thing. It's pure laziness on the part of the author, but as far as I'm concerned, I doubt any of them will leave a lasting impression on me. I hate to sound trite, but nice as Richard and Door were, they appeared one-dimensional, simple-minded, and jumbled. How on earth did Richard get over Jessica so easily? Any rational person in his situation would have plunged into an existentialpanic. Instead he sort of shuffles along, waiting to be told what to do next. <br /> <br />In conclusion: not a horrible way to spend a couple days, but I wouldn't recommend this book to fans of genre-fiction. Otherwise, I CAN see why it went over so well with the general population, but to those who liked it for the world: IT GETS WAY BETTER THAN THIS! (Just off the top of my head, try Dan Simmons, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Philip K Dick, Robert Heinlein, Orson Scott Card, Ursula le Guin)
0385504209|5.0|Once again our hero Robert Langdon is woke up by an urgent phone call. And we are off and running from another dead body. But this time our story has us delving into the secrets hidden in Da Vinci's art work. On a hidden trail left by the Templars. And perhaps a Quest for the Holy Grail. Dan Brown weaves his story mainly around Paris and London this time.<br /><br />You will not want to put this book down. If you pick up this book, read it without a critical eye, remember it is fiction. If you do this you will thourghly enjoy it. I am left wondering what Robert Langdon will be drawn into next...

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Not a movie for everyone.  But if you want to think a little and feel a lot, watch this movie.
B00005M91K|4.0|I saw this film when I was 17 years old.  The film can be taken two ways.  The first,  is that of a world moving from sacred harmony to a disconnected disaster(disconnected from what is left up to the viewer).  The second way this film can be taken,  is simply a portrait.  Buddha said life is suffering---Charles de Gaul said happiness is for idiots.  Simply said,  the film grasps the forces which move beyond our ideology---the rawness of existence-- which one feels in the clouds flowing over the mountains,  or the ancient chants,  or the 4000 year old tree dipected near the end of the film.  The film is not necessarly offering a dualistic choice between the de-spiritualized chicken factory and divine harmony,  but may simply be a snapshot of life----will you embrace it--the cost is great--maybe your sanitized TV,  computer games,  or ideologies seem a little safer.
B00005221M|5.0|I had absolutely panned this director's Cut in a previous review. I was wrong. I guess it was from the shock of seeing it for the first time and being confronted with changes to a movie I knew by heart. On a second viewing, however, I was really gratified to discover how good it is. I guess like most other things in life, it took getting used to. <br /> <br />This version definitely should not stand alone. But there is a certain rhythm, spacing and aesthetic which enhance the original VHS version. In many ways, it is a more three-dimensional representation. And aside from Cora's deleted dialogue in the cave scene, I really don't have much else to complain about. Also, missing from the VSH version (as well as the soundtrack) and, thankfully, added to this Director's Cut is some of the most haunting and gorgeous music from the score. In particular, the music that replaces Clannad is stunning in it's beauty and grace. It's a variation on the main theme. But that minor variation adds something magical to it.
B00005JL96|5.0|There have been some fine Disney animated features over the years, but this is the one that I watch over and over again. For my money, this stands head and shoulders above the rest of the animated movies I've seen (and I try to see them all).  <br /> <br />ANIMATION - A+: In the opening scene of the hula dancers, observe the reflections of the dancers on the wood floor. Wow! <br /> <br />PRODUCTION VALUES - A+: The movie is visually stunning. The backgrounds look like watercolor paintings and are extremely colorful. The backgrounds completely capture the look, colors, and flavor of living in a small town in Hawaii. <br /> <br />CHARACTER DESIGN - A+: The directors took great pains to design the look of the characters. Unlike most Disney women characters, the older sister has some meat on her bones and looks athletic, not anemic. Hallelujah! A more realistic approach to portraying women. <br /> <br />Lilo reminds me so much of my Hawaiian nieces in the way she moves and speaks! And the feistiness of her! Some people have said she does not present a good role model for children! I would say that she is a much more realistic child than usually shown in movies. I LOVE her spunk and strong personality! <br /> <br />My heart was completely captured by Stitch! What a roly poly, cute character he is. Chris Sanders, the director, provided the temporary voice of Stitch, but did such a great job that they kept his voice in the final movie. I can't imagine Stitch sounding any other way. <br /> <br />MUSIC = A+: Wow! The choral music sung by Hawaiian children is wonderfully moving! And of course, the King (Elvis)! Very appropriate as he was extremely popular in Hawaii. <br /> <br />TARGET AUDIENCE = B: The movie is SO entertaining for adults that I rather wonder if it isn't more enjoyable for adults than kids. I know that my three-year old niece wouldn't watch it because she thought the beginning was too \\"scary.\\" Whereas, I've watched it maybe 5 or 6 times and laughed each timeat the Elvis jokes and some of the other jokes that I think might go over the heads of children.  <br /> <br />And just between you and me (nobody else is reading this, right?), there are a few moments when Stitch reads the story of the Ugly Duckling, realizing that he too is separated from any family, and when he prepares to leave Lilo that always make me cry. How a little furry animated character can show dignity and nobility I don't know, but he does. <br /> <br />I find the movie a delight visually, musically, emotionally, and it makes me laugh! <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS = A+: I thought the extras on the DVD were quite nice. A great documentary on how the animators \\"got\\" the hula by attending a hula school, and a nice piece on the main animators and on the children's choir that sang the Hawaiian-style choral music in the film. Also lots of information on the Hawaiian islands. <br /> <br />
B0000025DR|4.0|\\"Face The Music\\" (1975) is a fine album from Jeff Lynne & Co. The critics really stopped and noticed ELO with this release. It was the beginning of a 5 year ride on the FM airwaves... starting with \\"Face The Music\\", \\"A New World Record\\" (1976), \\"Out Of The Blue\\" (1977) and \\"Discovery\\" (1979). Hands down, I feel that ELO's best bunch of songs are on \\"A New World Record\\". Their 2nd best effort is \\"Out Of The Blue\\" because of the many hits spawned, as well as the shear number of songs on this 2 album package (now on 1 cd). \\"Face The Music\\" is a close 3rd place though. One of my all-time favorite ELO songs as well as all-time favorite rock instrumentals is here - \\"Fire On High\\"; as well as the break-through hits \\"Evil Woman\\" and \\"Strange Magic\\". A few hidden gems in \\"One Summer Dream\\" and \\"Waterfall\\"; as well as a few duds in \\"Nightrider\\" and \\"Poker\\". I think the guitar is louder on this album than on any others that followed. The violins and cellos sound beautiful (as always). A classic and worthy of the purchase. ELO's guitars, synths, orchestration, and song writing really shine on \\"Face The Music\\".
0688163173|5.0|If you liked Mystic River, you'll love Shutter Island.  From page one, you will be, without a doubt, hooked.  Is there any better writer out there today in the mystery genre than Dennis Lehane? Nope.<br /><br />Welcome to Shutter Island, a small secluded island off of Boston Harbor accessible only via ferry -- and home to the macabre Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  The protagonist, Teddy Daniels, is a US Marshal in search of an escaped prisoner (or patient as the hospital staff refer to them as) who murdered her children and is under care at Ashecliffe.  Teddy, a veteran of The Korean War, is a hard-boiled no-nonsense gruff kind of gent who has become an alcoholic and depressed from the death of his late wife.<br /><br />The story, which takes place in the early 1950's, creates a dark and morose feeling from the start -- not unlike Mystic River.  As the story progresses, facts and names begin to blur for both Teddy and the reader.  I (along with Teddy) was never quite sure what to believe or who to trust.  This makes for quite an addictive page-turner and an incredibly fun read that keeps you hanging until the last page.  Not to be missed.<br /><br />\\"He knew the only way to conquer fear was to face it.\\"<br />- Dennis Lehane
B000286S8S|4.0|OVERVIEW: 2004 - A nice selection of Van Halen songs from Rhino. As with any compilation with a band that's been around for decades, it's tough to narrow down the best tunes and get it right for a 1 or 2 disc collection. Rhino has made some good choices here, but it's definitely lacking in several different areas. Let me also state that Van Halen rocks the old school way - and ANY Van Halen is good Van Halen... just some tunes are better than others.<br /><br />WHAT YOU GET: 2 discs. 36 songs. Digitally remastered sound. 3 new tracks with Sammy Hagar on vocals. 3 live tracks (from \\"Right Here, Right Now\\"). A nice tri-fold CD case with the red/black/white designed stripes from Eddie's early guitars on the cover. 4 black & white photo's of the band (Eddie, Alex, Michael & Sammy) on the inside flap... but, strangely omitted is David Lee Roth. In fact, Roth isn't pictured at all or listed in writing (or in the credits) anywhere on this CD case. I find this strange and I want to point the finger at somebody (Rhino, or the band themselves). This is playground finger pointing and name-calling at its worst. It's simply a damn shame that Rhino didn't step forward. It's equally disappointing that Sammy & Eddie probably dictated what they wanted and no one questioned it.<br /><br />THE GOOD: As stated before, ALL Van Halen is good Van Halen. VH's debut is best represented with 5 tracks here. \\"1984\\", \\"5150\\", \\"OU812\\", and \\"For Unlawful Carnel Knowledge\\" all contain 4 tracks on \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\". The new tracks (\\"It's About Time\\", \\"Learning To See\\" and \\"Up For Breakfast\\") are good Sammy songs, but by no means considered classic. The live tracks are good, but the studio versions are all ready present on the album - why not take a song that isn't here (like VH's great live rendition of The Who's \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\")? The digitally remastered sound is crisp and the bass guitars and drums sound deep (like Alex & Michael are in the same room with you).<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD: As I mentioned before, it's a shame David Lee Roth gets no credit here. He is part of the band's history. He's helped write some of their absolute best music. The band's feuding has taken center stage at times - and I feel like this is a huge slap in the face for one of the band's creators. There are no liner notes - no history, no song writing credits, no knowing what songs came from what albums or the year they were released. Regarding the song selection (or lack there of)... Van Halen \\"II\\" has only 2 songs on this release (where is \\"Bottom's Up\\" or \\"Light Up The Sky\\"?). \\"Fair Warning\\" has only 1 song here (where is \\"Mean Street\\", \\"So This Is Love?\\" or \\"Dirty Movies\\"?). \\"Diver Down\\" has 2 songs here (no \\"Secrets\\" or \\"Little Guitars\\"). For the most part, Rhino hit the mark with the Sammy songs, however I would have liked to have seen included here \\"Cabo Wabo\\", \\"Mine All Mine\\" and \\"The Seventh Seal\\". Missing is the song \\"Humans Being\\" (from the movie soundtrack \\"Twister\\"). Also omitted is anything from \\"Van Halen 3\\" featuring Gary Cherone... thank you Rhino! However putrid \\"3\\" was, maybe one song could have made it here for history's sake. The three 'live' songs are OK, but repetitive and other tracks could've been added in their place. Not to mention Sammy singing three Roth tunes live - Hagar written tunes would've been better choices here. The song \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" finishes abruptly... like someone just shut the machine off when burning it. I think a chronological view would have been benefitted this release - showcasing the band's early years, maturing (if you can really say that) and then changing singers. I think \\"Eruption\\" really needs to be next to \\"You Really Got Me\\". All \\"Best Of\\" compilations are hit & miss in my book. \\"The Best Of Both Worlds\\" is a good listen from Rhino, but too many minor discrepancies keep this from being a 5-star review.re, it's a shame David Lee Roth gets no credit here.

B000002JQ6|4.0|I went 15 years between concerts and the band doesn't miss a beat.  I recommend seeing the concert, going back and buying \\"If You Want Blood You Got It\\", and just turning this release up until the neighbors knock down your door with the police and/or your parents kicking you out of the house.  Brian Johnson mixes some classics from present to past honoring the late, great, but never straight Bon \\"may you always rest in peace\\" Scott.
B00000JPYD|5.0|I saw Robin Trower 33 years ago with Procol Harum.  He is just a wonderful guitarist who has had to live with the ghost of Jimi Hendrix.  Yes, he uses feedback, but unlike Hendrix, always with a purpose.  Trower had a genius for putting together a great ensemble of singers and musicians for his albums and he does this best in Bridge of Sighs.  This CD is worth the price, if only for the title track.  Trower truly bridges rock and blues.  Just listen to the opening track \\"Day of the Eagle.\\"  Since the so-called \\"Classic Rock\\" stations can't play enough Zeppelin,  Skynrd, or Who you will almost never hear Trower on the radio.  Bridge of Sighs belongs in every Rock CD collection.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|Independence Day (1996) is a great film. It is about how an (alpha) alien race seeks to destroy other living species throughout the universe, and the next living beings on their list to destroy are the humans on Earth!! After New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles are laid to waste by their city sized destroyer ships' destructive laser beams, it is up to the humans to fight back with their war technology and survive against the evil extraterrestrial empire. The movie was well done, good computer animation for special effects like the explosions and alien spaceships, great action, and an all star cast, like Bill Pullman, Will Smith, and other actors. Bond composer David Arnold also gave a great music score that went along with the film. Well done, a recommended movie!

B00005JMJG|5.0|This is my favorite movie of 2004.  This is a movie that will remind you why you still watch movies.  If you haven't seen it yet, go buy it and watch it over and over.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I must have seen this film 25 times and it just gets better and better each time!  This is definately a love/hate film though.  I have never met anyone that just thinks it's ok.  People either hate it or love it, similiar to the reaction to Fargo.  I recommend it highly if you want more than just brainless comedy.  You have to really study this movie, and like I said, it gets better each time.
B00008NRL8|4.0|I am a ballroom dancer and heard one of the tracks at the studio and wandered over to the CD player.  I caught the name of the group and began to get more info on their music.  Wow, how fun and interesting!  Some of the songs are great to dance to (tango and rumba) or just listen and enjoy.   <br /> <br />In an age where we hear so much \\"noise\\" that tries to pass as music, it is enjoyable to hear the simple sounds of the instruments blended together for a unique sound.
B0000214F0|1.0|This movie sits right up there with \\"Showgirls\\" as one of the most outrageously BAAAAAAAAD films ever made---the script, direction, acting, camera work, production values...are just unbelievably cheesy.<br /><br />About the only half-OK parts of the film are the sex and nudity, a few of which are really twisted and difficult to watch (e.g. Caligula's intrusion into a wedding party during which he violates both bride and groom).<br /><br />Many people have panned Guccione's sad attempt at high art as \\"pornography\\"---I certainly agree in that most porno films, you constantly find yourself fast forwarding to all the sex scenes.<br /><br />Sad, when considering what a true cinematic genius like Stanley Kubrick could've done with this material.
B000002KHH|5.0|Yes, I am well aware that many will disagree with the statement I made above. Some say it was Led Zeppelin. Well, nope. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Zep, but they are classic rock, or, for the time, hard rock. Sure, Black Sabbath is classic rock as well, but with it's dark tone, scary (for the time) lyrics, and evil-sounding riffs, it was Sabbath who first got the parents worried about this thing called \\"heavy metal\\". <br /> <br />This is Sabbath's second album, and was their major breakthrough. Yes, \\"N.I.B.\\" from the first album was a hit, but \\"Paranoid\\" was their defining moment in rock history. Everybody knows the great songs \\"Paranoid\\", and \\"Iron Man\\". Come on, \\"Iron Man\\" has the most familiar riff ever. \\"Dun, dun, dun dun dun, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, dun dun, dun dun\\" Every budding guitarist feel like they owe it to themselves to learn this riff. But we also have the trippy-but-creepy \\"Electric Funeral\\", the anti-war \\"War Pigs\\", and, of course, the closing rocker, \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\". <br /> <br />Oh yeah, and did I mention this is the album that made Ozzy Osbourne famous? <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a great piece of classic rock/heavy metal history that needs to be owned by everyone who likes the genre. And, of course, every metal band owes its career to Sabbath. \\"Black Sabbath\\" was great, but this is the one that helped to make Ozzy Osbourne a rock 'n' roll legend.
B000274THQ|5.0|\\"Goodbye Lenin\\" chronicles the life of an East Berlin family in the days just before and just after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Socialism had become a dead force in the lives of many, except for those who used it to salve the pain of lost loves and missed opportunities. Mother Katrin Sass suffers a heart attack during a demonstration and goes into a coma for 8 months. During that time, the Wall falls and East Germany begins its transformation from dull, gray socialism to loud, rainbow-hued capitalism. Fearing another and fatal attack, children Alex (Daniel Bruhl) and Ariane (Maria Simon) with the help of a video wiz friend concoct a plan to convince their mother that her beloved socialist republic still lives.<br /><br />The trailers for this movie focused on its comical aspects, but there was much more here a few laughs. \\"Goodbye Lenin\\" is about devotion to parents; about facing (or hiding from) the uprooting of one's system of meaning; of healing the wounds of separated families; of the pain of losing one's \\"permanent\\" social status. But mainly, the film ponders the cost of lies in society -- the political lies that keep populations placid and the lies that preserve a loved one's dignity. And it has many, many sweet, human and funny moments.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Two days post election and I am simply stunned by its outcome.  I can only think of that Saturday Night Live sketch where John Lovit, as Michael Dukakis, says \\"I can't believe I'm loosing to this guy\\", then referring to GBush Senior in the debates.  No need to rewrite it- just change the hair and make-up for Kerry/GWBush.  Farenheit 911 is a masterpiece.  Of course it is biased in what it presents but this is the nature of critique.  The democrats were hardly spared in the opening sequence in which no member of Congress would sponsor the reps call to have the Florida voters' rights upheld in our \\"democracy\\".  Watch it, internalize and develop your own sense of the state of our whole political system.  A true horror flick.
B00005JNJ7|3.0|Team America: World Police did not look like a movie that would be very good to see.  The trailers for the movie were obviously un-funny, due to the fact that most of the funny content is too obscene for preview material.  I was unsure about seeing this movie.  I liked the South Park movie, but could I stand sitting through an hour and a half of puppets.  I wasen't sure until I heard three words:  Puppet Sex Scene.    T.A.W.P. is basically making fun of America's foreign policy of trying to police the world.  Everytime the World Police try to stop a terrorist, they end up destroying more in the country that they are in, than the terrorists would have, i.e. destroying pyramids in Egypt when trying to stop terrorists.      The movie does a fair job of poking fun at both liberals and conservatives.  The people that got made fun of the most were Kim Jung Il, and a Hollywood actors group, Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.)  Alec Baldwin, George Clooney, Tim Robbins, and Liv Tyler get made fun of big time and also get killed.  Along with the pig Michael Moore, whom Trey Parker portrays as a incredible fat guy holding two hot dogs with ketchup and mustard stains all over his shirt. GREAT!!    The movie itself has a decent plot, but the funny parts are spread out too far and there is a lot of not funny talking in between.  The best part of the movie is, by far, the puppet sex scene.  I don't know if I have ever laughed so hard in any part of a movie as I did watching this sex scene.  And this scene had to be cut down so that the movie would not receive an NC-17 rating. I can't imagine what was cut out.  Another highlight of the film were the songs.  The \\"theme\\" song for Team America was entitled \\"America - F*** Yeah!\\" and was it a catchy song.  Also Kim Jung Il\\"s \\"Ronley\\" song and the song that tells how much freedom costs ($1.05) are also hilarious.    My overall opinion is that Team America: World Police is definately worth seeing one time.  The second time would probably get oldand tiresome, due to the fact that most of the jokes are heavy on shock value.  It is not the funniest film of the year, but if you are a fan of South Park or Stone and Parker's humor, you will definately like this movie.  And watch out for Stone and Parker.  They are making a heavy case to be this generations Mel Brooks, by becoming the new kings of the spoof.
0440180295|4.0|Slaughter House Five is one of the most unique novels I've ever read.  I am only 17 and my knowledge of books grows every year- and I think my mind expanded a little bit after reading the dark humor of Vonnegut.  His way of writing is so captivating I really couldn't put the book down.  The novel is extremely metatexual, in that, Vonnegut actually wrote himself into the novel, but he conveys his ideas through a really, almost robotic character Billy Pilgrim. <br />   Billy Pilgrim (play on the name pilgrim=pioneer maybe?) is a really an emotionless character, the reader never becomes aware of his likes and dislikes only that he becomes unstuck in time.  This concept of time and how relevant it is in every aspect of life is the driving force of the novel.  Many would say this book is an anti-war novel, and it is to an extent. <br />   I think Billy's mind split while in the war- this shows how war can destroy one's sense of reality.  The book also opens with an introduction about Vonnegut's own journey into writing the novel and how he decided to make it known that children fought wars not men.  I really enjoyed one quote about how stopping war is like stopping glaciers- it isn't gonna happen.  This book is an anti-war novel but it is so much more.   <br />    Slaughter House Five really takes the notion of time and plays with it.  What if time is just a man-made schedual to exist in our daily lives.  What if time is just moments- like every person is just one long string of moments.  I think one the books strongest messages is for one to focus on the good moments of life and not the bad...like war for instance.  Either way this novel is great read and an easy read- which I am all for considering my reading load at a private college prep school is not what I consider light work.  Just enjoy the thoughts the novel evokes and I promise a fun read! <br />
B000089RVX|3.0|Let me be clear -- the only difference between the goth scene and daytime soap operas is that the actors in soap operas know that they are playing deluded, sentimental, and overly dramatic characters; goths, however, don't seem to understand that they are narcissistic and delusional.  They actually seem to believe that the sense of exceptionality they feel is authentic.  Actually, let me revise what I just said.  We can also compare the melodrama of goth to the bad \\"hair\\" bands of the '80s, though if one were to ask me to choose between the two, I would be hard pressed to choose the lesser of the two banalities. <br /> <br />That said, this is a solid album precisely because it does a good job of doing what it sets out to do: make pretentious and melodramatic music seem to be \\"deep.\\" <br /> <br />Just a goth vocab primer if you need some brushing up: <br /> <br />haunting: melodramatic  <br />dark: repetitive chords <br />
B00005JNEU|3.0|This movie was ok... It was one of those films you walk out of unchanged...like it didn't matter if you had seen it or not.  The movie didn't quite hold my full attention...I found myself wondering when it was going to be over but there were some good aspects of the film.  I really enjoyed the documentary-like feel to the movie- it made the story really come to life as if the viewer were there.  It was also a good depiction of highschool football, in that, these guy's lives turned into a fight to win and nothing else.  They had one motive and no other aspects to their lives.  However, as good a depiction it was- I think the movie lacked character developement.  Some of the guys we get to know- but others not so much.  The film opens with the quarter back and this makes the viewer assume that he will be a driving character for the movie but we really don't get to know him all that well.  This is a flaw with numerous other characters as well- the movie really only shows you the surface level of some the guys.  So I couldn't really get that emotionally involved.  But the movie did stur up some tears, so i do reccomend seeing it if you are a football fan- but maybe as just a rental-
B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers is a superior monster movie and necessary viewing for Horror junkies.  A seemingly unstoppable beast that waits 23 years for 23 days of human munching gluttony. What really works with this film is the abundance of implications of greater evil, in particular the \\"larder\\" scene.  The onscreen body count is relatively low but the creep factor is high because as humans we like being at the top of the food chain.<br /><br />The Creeper is one heck of an interesting beast, a winged humanoid fond of dusters and wide brimmed hats that drives the scariest on screen vehicle since Duel.  He makes his own weapons and can track you down by the scent of your fear.  One more thing, he's got his own theme song.<br /><br />\\"I don't know if it's a demon or a devil, or just some hungry thing from some dark place in time.\\"<br /><br />There is some gore and carnage in this film but nothing over the top, playing more to our fears of helplessness and the unknown.<br /><br />\\"Whatever it eats becomes a part of it.\\"<br /><br />Any movie that messes with my primal fears of being something's lunch and pitted against an unstoppable foe is going to get high marks in my book.  Jeepers Creepers does that incredibly well and therefore I can't recommend it enough.  I just wish more studios made movies like this.<br /><br />\\"Tastes so darn good!\\"
B00029LNHS|1.0|In my opinion, I've never seen any hip-hop artist sell out like the Black Eyed Peas did in Elephunk. If you want to hear some great music, check out their previous cd's, they're through and through some of the best albums I've ever heard. I don't buy Cd's all that often and when I purchased this cd, I couldn't have been more let down. Unless you're 12 years old and like \\"Lets Get it Started/Retarded\\" then this should be entirely disappointing for you. Sorry to say it because I previously loved BEP when they used to diss sold out artists, until they became one of them.

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|What a blast of fresh musical goodness.  Heard \\"take me out\\" on satellite radio (pity it got overplayed to hell on mtv) and bought this album.  The upbeat, catchy riffs and rhythm  keep you moving from track 1 to 11.

0385474547|5.0|If you're not careful, you will think all Chinua Achebe is doing, in a very simplistic writing style, is giving a flat historical account of the Ibo (or Igbo) culture before and after its initial contact with the British empire.  How wrong.    What Achebe has done so masterfully is bridge a primitive culture with our modern one to say, in essence, we're no different.  I love how when the novel begins there seems to be an ageless, mythological aura to the story, with an earth goddess and with oracles and with the many naturalistic proverbs, and with how simplistic  Achebe keeps his language--just as limited as the Ibo language itself.    What we have to do as readers is piece the many flashbacks and plotlines together.  It's work, but it's wonderfully fun work, like fitting together a puzzle we don't yet know what it is a picture of, and when the picture is ultimately revealed, it's so surprising, how Nigeria slowly becomes the rest of the world, how paganism might as well be Christianity, how ultimately human nature is human nature.    There is criticism of colonialism, but there is more important criticism of \\"home,\\" of the Ibo culture itself, in terms of how it rots from within at its core, due to its declining respect and barbaric treatment of women (which points directly to the declining faith of what the earth goddess herself embodies).  So despite the simple language and seemingly simple plot, the novel is quite a complex metaphor for each and every one of us. Of both the best and worst within each one of us.    Which is a perfect reminder/warning to us on the outside:  \\"Be careful.  Don't judge.  You're guilty, too.  You're guilty of being strong, even too strong, and you're guilty of being weak, even too weak, and that's nothing to be afraid of.  You don't need to feel superior or inferior due to this.  You only need to be aware of this, to keep this about yourself in check.\\"

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this album and I think it is very Christmasyyyy!

B00028HBKM|2.0|Once again, I see signs of the new Dark Age. This film is nothing but some zealot's (Gibson is part of this ultra-orthodox Catholic sect) view of what true Christianity is all about. I'd rather watch Hellraiser VII than re-wating this bloody, boring, organized-religion propaganda. People don't see this film as a film, its more like going to a revival meeting than going to a movie. <br /> <br />    The dogmatic view of true spiritual enlightenment through pain, death and suffering is nothing more than a means of social control to keep the disenfranchised in line. Historical evidence proves that this whole crucifixion story is suspect. Sadly, people are so hooked on their own suffering as a means of proving their devotion to God that they cannot face a more hopeful and uplifting story of Jesus. <br /> <br />   But, unlike alot of critics, I don't want to ban this ode to bloodletting. That is the religious fanatic's method of handling something they don't like.  This film is not a Piety test, its simply a poor movie based on a suspect story. <br /> <br />  God knows what the real story is, I would really like to see a movie based on historical fact rather than a snuff-film designed to scare rubes into rushing back to the church.

B00008DDSC|4.0|Steven Shainberg's \\"Secretary\\" is not a movie for everyone, but it should be. It depicts with honesty and wit a S/M relationship, a kind of alternative lifestyle that is usually used as a punch line or a sick joke. Instead, \\"Secretary\\" treats it fairly, and ends up being a fascinating character study of two very damaged people finding love in their own way. It contains wonderful directing and a clever screenplay, and two brilliant performances by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal.<br /><br />\\"Secretary\\" is the story of Lee Holloway, played to absolute perfection by Maggie Gyllenhaal. When we first meet Lee, she is being released from a mental institution. Lee comes from an unhappy family life, and has been cutting herself since she was fourteen years old. It isn't long before her father's alcoholism and her mother's cluelessness drive her to self-mutilation once again. Realising that she is in a precarious situation, the chronically self-conscious Lee decides to get a job for the first time in her life.<br /><br />That's when she meets E. Edward Grey (James Spader), a lawyer who has an uncanny connection with Lee's pain. He hires Lee as his secretary, and it soon becomes obvious that Lee finds him attractive. Edward first plays humiliation games with Lee, such as forcing her to look for lost files in a dumpster, which she readily does. Then things get kinkier, as Edward begins to spank Lee when she makes a typo. Much to her surprise, Lee is incredibly turned on by this, and starts to make mistakes just to get punished.<br /><br />The plot twists much further from there, but I won't give it away. \\"Secretary\\" is a duet between two exceptionally gifted actors, and James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal deliver honest and brave portrayals of two people drowning. What you remember most about \\"Secretary\\" are the silences, when the camera focuses only on the expressive faces of Spader and Gyllenhaal. You can see the unfathomable depths of Lee's pain on her face, and the love that Edward feels for her and his shame for acting it out on Spader's.<br /><br />What makes \\"Secretary\\" a very important movie is summed up by Lee towards the end of the movie. She says, \\"In one way or another I've always suffered. But I know I'm not so scared of suffering now. And I've found a way that's right for me.\\" In an age where so many films pass judgement on alternative lifestyles, \\"Secretary\\" simply says that this relationship is right for Lee and Edward, is loving and healthy.

This album contains probably the best (and most catchy :S) lyrics of any of the last albums of the last 4 years (at least out of rap, rock, metal, garage and punk rock), and is definitely worth the 14 bucks. <br /> <br />Here's a song by song analysis: <br /> <br />1. American Idiot - Decent catchy song, but like every other single I can remember, radio has killed it. And some. 3/5 <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia - Terrible Song; worst on the album. 1/5 <br /> <br />3. Holiday - Very good song; decent lyrics go with very good singing and catchy beats. 5/5 <br /> <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams - Best song on the album. Just found out it's there 20 times in my \\"Last 100\\" previously played :O. 5/5 <br /> <br />5. Are We the Waiting - Again catchy beats and lyrics. Not as great as the last two though. 4/5 <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy - A bit fast for my liking. Beats are nice though. 3/5 <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novacaine - Great song. 4/5 <br /> <br />8. She's A Rebel - Catchy (gee I've used that a lot). 4/5 <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl - Don't really like this song, but the beats are, again, catchy. 3/5 <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb - Not a bad song, not great either though. 3/5 <br /> <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends - Very good, slow song. CATCHY (GAH IS THERE A SYNONYM FOR THIS?!) beats AND lyrics. 5/5 <br /> <br />12. Home-Coming - Not so great a song. Too long too. 2/5 <br /> <br />13. Whatsername - Alright song, gets old though. 4/5 <br /> <br />Final verdict? Get the damn album already.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril shines in her debut \\"Let Go\\", her angsty hardcore pop-rock album featuring the single \\"Complicated\\". Unlike most pop artists, Avril delivers unique songs, relatable messages and beautiful music.  <br /> <br />Despite hearing constantly that Avril is a poser, a wannabe-punk rocker and an all around idiot...I don't see how this album proves that in general. Avril has a purely decent and rough voice, and \\"Complicated\\" is a brilliant song about people when they lose themselves to the crowd and try to hard. <br /> <br />Other hits like \\"Things I'll Never Say\\", \\"Mobile\\" and \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" are any depressed or anxious teen's anthems...speaking out about changes in life, feelings about a guy and just plain ordinary concepts that hardly any other artist fails to cover. <br /> <br />Although it's technically popular music, \\"Let Go\\" is also an emotional emotive portrait of fear, love, angst and passion. Avril shines in songs with beautiful lyrics like \\"With You\\", and delivers catchy tunes from the infamous \\"Sk8r Boi\\" and the lesser-acknowledged \\"Naked\\". <br /> <br />Punk? Maybe. But this album is definatly worth a listen.
B00000DOYR|5.0|Back in Black has to be the best work AC/DC ever did. Almost fading out of the Rock 'N' Roll Picture after the unfourtuneate death of Bon Scott, AC/DC made a huge come in &quot;Back in Back&quot;. Wether its the Darker-Rock song &quot;Hells Bells&quot; or the &quot;Song that made AC/DC famous&quot;&quot;You Shook me All Night Long&quot; this album has the highest standards available. You can't fully experience the disk unless you listen to the cover song &quot;Back in Black&quot;. Angus Young does some of his best guitar work ever here. However, the CDs not just about the popular titles. &quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot; and &quot;Rock 'N' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution&quot; are some of the best out there. It may seem like AC/Dc forgot Bon Scott after his tragic death, but consider &quot;Back in Black&quot;'s cover and name. The tombstone like letters that say &quot;Back in Black&quot;, and just them name &quot;Back in Black&quot; is a silent tribute to the loving memory of Bon Scott.
B000002U82|5.0|Thanks a lot, floyd. You've changed my life. Is the best CD I've heard in my life. Thank you Mr. Waters
B00009P1O2|5.0|Previously, this concert was only visually available on a VHS which contained only highlights from this amazing show.  However, the complete concert was available on CD for the world to hear.  So of course, there was great demand for visual footage of the complete concert, particularly when the DVD format was introduced.  In the summer of 2003, Queen released the second installment of the Queen DVD Collection by giving the fans what they desired for so long, and the result is beyond phenomenal.  The DVD was given a new look and title (the old one being \\"Live At Wembley '86\\"), and the CD was rereleased with the new title and artwork with bonus tracks (also well worth picking up). <br /> <br />This DVD both looks and sounds phenomenal, as if it were recorded yesterday.  Both sound and picture are as crisp and clear as can be.  The music blares out of the speakers and gets the adrenaline pumping at a rapid rate.  Those who view this are in for an amazing visual and audio experience. <br /> <br />Though this was Queen's penultimate concert of their career, one would not think so, as they are truly in top form.  \\"One Vision\\" kicks things off with a real bang, as \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" follows and continues to rock you hard.  A real treat here is \\"In The Lap Of The Gods,\\" and obscure track from the Sheer Heart Attack album.  One major high point is the \\"Brighton Rock Solo,\\" where one gets to watch the master, Brian May, in action.  The acoustic set of oldies is also very enjoyable as the band really appears to be having a blast.  Every track is jaw-droppingly awesome. <br /> <br />In their stage show, Queen show that they are just as good showmen as they are musicians.  Freddie Mercury is arguably the greatest frontman in the history of rock music, and that is definitely evident here.  Moments such as the vocal interplay with the audience, the crowd taking over the singing of \\"Love Of My Life,\\" and the entire stadium clapping in unison during \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" shows Freddie'salbility to work an entire stadium.  One particularly touching moment is when Freddie reassures everyone that Queen have no plans to split up despite rumors (\\"They're talking from here\\" [points to his rear end]) and says that the band will stay together \\"until we f--king well die.\\"  He was right.  They never split up, and they stayed together until the end. <br /> <br />Continuing the high standard of Queen DVD releases starting with Greatest Video Hits 1, there is also a second disc loaded with bonus features, including all-new exclusive interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor, footage from the previous night at Wembley, a photo gallery, and some bootleg rehearsal footage.  Like GVH1, this release has a very strong drool factor. <br /> <br />Every Queen fan must own this DVD.  You all know this concert, you've all heard the original CD, you've all seen the original edited-to-bits VHS, this is what you've been craving.  And it is now available to us, and the result could not be better.  A Queen fan would be mad not to buy this.  You know you love Queen, don't bother to hesitate, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />5/5
B00005Q66T|3.0|I feel that madonna is a brilliant artist... she always keeps her fans on her toes of see what she does next...  <br /> <br />madonna is just OVERRATED.... everytime she comes out she is always hyped a little too much...  <br /> <br />this greatest hits 2 LP was decent but lacked all of her better songs...  <br /> <br />there is no doubt that the best song on the album and her career is \\"take a bow\\". the song showed that she could actually sing and the video is to die 4.  the video is shot beautifully by far her best video.... <br /> <br />'ray of light' 'human nature' (shows that she can rap not like the 2002 song \\"american life\\"), 'erotica' and 'beautiful stranger' are the best songs on this LP... she showed something different in each song... <br /> <br />overall this GH2 LP is not all that great and her first one was way better... <br /> <br />3 stars
0783225725|1.0|The out of print version of this DVD is 106 minutes, IMDB has a run time for High PLains Drifter as 105 minutes.  The only available version is much shorter.  Can someone comment on this, as there is no way I would ever buy a shorter version of a film, and no one else would either.
0380789035|5.0|Oh my!  I went into reading this book not knowing it would be placed in my top five favourite books of all time.  I absolutely love it!  The story takes the character known as Shadow.  He is released from Prison awaiting to return to his love who he learns died (along with someone else...).  He meets a man known at first as Mr. Wednesday.  This man knows too much about Shadow than can be safe.  He offers Shadow a job, to work for him.  Run errands and protect him, etc.  And with that, Shadow is swept off his feet and into the midst of a war between the gods of old and the new \\"american\\" gods (ie: Media, Internet, Sex, etc...)  Along the way he is imprisioned meets many gods and goddesses, makes new friends and goes through many plot twists (even dies a few times).<br /><br />This is an exceptional book.  And one you are guaranteed to learn quite a bit about humanity and what are beliefs can do to us and others.  One other thing I loved about this book:  Every few chapters were these \\"Coming to America\\" interludes, which consisted of little stories from the beginning of time to around the 1800s.  They showed people of different cultures and religions coming to America and bringing their gods (or incarnations of the gods) with them, to a land \\"that is not good for gods.\\"<br /><br />Excellent book.  Keep it up Mr. Gaiman!
B00004XMV6|5.0|Loved this movie.  A classic erotic film, its scenes of seduction and passion are the epitomy of scorching sex, that lustful and enticing relationship everyone fantasizes about.  See it...
B00005JNEI|4.0|Compared to Bowling for Columbine, this movie is strangly unfocused as it jumps around a bit too much.  That said, he brings up very interesting subjects and also some troubling questions.  This continues his crusade against the elite and corporate culture.  It isn't anti-American or encourages terrorists, it asks questions that need to be asked.  Regardless of politics, this country (and the world for that matter) need people like Michael Moore, people who make us think outside the box and for that I applaud him.
B000001ESN|5.0|It seemed that most people knew RUSH by the sheer radio play of 'Spirit of Radio', before any other RUSH song before those supplied by their next studio album \\"Moving Pictures\\".   <br /> <br />\\"Permanent Waves\\" is interesting for it's stand alone value, each song crafted with such creative and were well represented in thier live shows. <br /> <br />Lyrically one of the more poetic albums - <br /> <br />\\"The clouds prepare for battle, In the dark and brooding silence\\" in Jacob's Ladder <br /> <br />\\"Just between us, I think it's time for us to realize. <br />The spaces in between, leave room for you and I to grow.\\" in Entre Nous <br /> <br />\\"Different eyes see different things, Different hearts beat on different strings.\\" in Different Strings <br /> <br />\\"The most endangered species, The honest man, <br />Will still survive annihilation.\\" in Natural Science <br /> <br />\\"Emotional feedback on timeless wavelength, Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free...\\" in Spirit of Radio <br /> <br />And from Freewill  - \\"There are those who think that life has nothing left to chance, A host of holy horrors to direct our aimless dance.\\" <br /> <br />It you have to get one more RUSH album, make it this one. <br />
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This movie may just be the funniest movie I have ever seen. Even though the last twenty minutes were aa bit glib, the rest was absolutely hysterical. Clever humour, hillarious songs, great lines, and fabulous puppet acting make this movie one of the funniest movies ever. <br /> <br />The most intriguing part however, as some patriots might not notice, is that the main spoof in the movie is how we take such pride in our country and our strong beliefs, and lies, about terrorist organizations. I, however, am quite the total opposite of a patriot, so I quickly noticed this effect. The greater thing about this movie is that Matt and Trey took all the things we were told terrorists had (i.e. Weapons of mass destruction) and showed how it would have been if all of this was true. <br /> <br />And the puppet sex scene: 6 stars.
B000007VCM|5.0|I borrowed this cd from my brother back in 1987 and quickly became hooked. I can remember seeing the video for She Sells Sanctuary and thinking \\"This is the way dance music should be\\". Billy's guitar playing carries the album and Ian's lyrics add a mystical quality. I love every song from start to finish. My favorites are Big Neon Glitter, Brother Wolf Sister Moon, Rain, She Sells Sanctuary, Black Angel. The solo to Brother Wolf is very moving and the riffs to Rain and Sanctuary are addictive. This album is not as raw and rockin as Electric but it is still my favorite Cult album.
0425152251|4.0|*Spoilers Ahead*<br /><br />I thought is was a great introduction to philosophy; it gave me a strong basis to learn more specific information later. You will probably find that your comprehension lowers as you read, due to the sheer amount of information in the book. The first reading, I skimmed much of the philosophy course in the middle, caught up as I was in the story. The second time through I went more slowly and tried to absorb all the details. In order to really read this book, you need to be seriously interested in philosphy. It really sparked my interest, and now I study philosophy whenever I can.<br /><br />The plot is fairly good, though slow-moving at first. The idea of the book-inside-a-book I found intriguing, but slightly odd. Would an author really write his characters into a revolt against him? The characters were somewhat likeable, though Sophie seemed rather passive for a main character, with her two words per thirty pages. She is taught by Alberto Knox, a sort of Albus-Dumbledore-with-a-beret sort of character whose actual personality is hard to pin down.<br /><br />The ending was very strange, and not just for the fact that somehow Alberto and Sophie escaped the book. The philisophical garden party degraded into something rather like a dream, where nothing made real sense. The final resolution was almost too openended--I would have appreciated a little epilogue.<br /><br />One small thing that annoyed me to no end was the type parts of the book were written in. The lessons, and the sections from Hilde's perspective, were set in a different typeface. For some inexplicable reason, this drove me absolutely crazy.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent read for young or beginning philosophers. Approach the book with an open mind and you'll enjoy it.
B00005JLK1|1.0|I mean, the absolute worst.  It stands alone in a steaming wad of egregiously awful films.  After viewing the movie, I laughed for a little over 15 minutes to the bewilderment of my friends: \\"How can a movie -hahaha- *snork, cough* -ahahahahaha-be this freaking -hehehehehehehehehe-  *hack* BAD???, I howled in a fit of ridculous, snorking giggles.  I have seen better film on ponds.  Please, please, see this movie.  It is sort of hysterical in a way.  I mean, how did it even come to fruition?
B000001ESF|5.0|2112 reflects on a musical journey of a future and yet holds all of us to Earthly concerns that can never be addressed solely by belief or faith. <br /> <br />All the songs give the listener something to enjoy and to hear such masterful song writing and song demostration is surely reflective of the best of humanity. <br /> <br />The first track was inspired by the classic Ayn Rand novels and is more true to seeking god then pretending that there is only one view to all things. <br /> <br />Listen to the wordsmithing and musical aspects of \\"Lessons\\" or \\"Tears\\" or \\"Something for Nothing\\" and then tell me these musicians are not very talented.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I have seen it written in other reviews that Marillion, or at least this particular work, takes a few listens to fully appreciate its depth and quality. I would have to agree. But what awaits thereafter and for unlimited listening sessions of Marbles, as has been my case, is the discovery of work of sheer substance, steeped in refined musicianship, and powerful writing and voice. I became familiar with Marillion only recently through this piece, having searched for years for an artist even closely comparable to early and mid-era Genesis. That is not to say I am old-schooler or have a limited scope of music. If you are anywhere below the age of 30, I cannot recommend a better piece than Marbles to introduce you to music that will move you without being contrived. And if you are familiar with Genesis in its heyday, you will no doubt herald the coming of Marbles, not for sounding or looking like Genesis, but for the essence of musicianship, passion and awe few bands have ever achieved since Genesis (or Pink Floyd or King Crimson). <br /> <br />Marillion has no doubt been through a number of morphications. I have not met any other Marillion fans yet, but somehow I feel they are wowed by Marbles, despite its departure from previous expressions. Frankly, I've listened to a little of their older stuff and (please excuse me Loyal Fans) I don't believe they hold a candle to the degree of sophistication and maturity of this work. <br /> <br />I won't name which songs are best and which songs aren't. That's up to you. It's the whole of Marbles that works as do the individual tracks. Treasure Marbles. They don't come along like this very often. If Marillion is even slightly considered an aging group, think again. It appears they have just come into their prime.
B00005OW5V|5.0|Fans of early Heep probably will not care for this album much. It is slicker and more commercial than their 70s albums. But I think it rocks all the way through. With Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake coming over from Ozzy, Pete Goalby (great vocals) coming from Trapeze, and keyboardist John Sinclair coming from the Heavy Metal Kids, guitarist Mick Box had put together a great lineup. Who cares if some of the songs were covers (namely On The Rebound by Russ Ballard), this album sounds fresh and full of energy. It's hard for me to choose my favs because I like them all. Get it and give it at least a few listens all the way through.
0812550706|5.0|I thought that this was a great book. One of my favorites, and mabey my favorite. The plot is like no other, and thats a good thing. It is very detailed and gives lots of details on the story. You should pay close attention to the beginnig of the book, as it gives lots of info for the whole story. If you dont understand, I suggest that you read over, because if you get the whole story, it is very exciting. The plot is that alien \\"buggers\\" are trying to take over the Earth, and the military is \\"breeding\\" military geniusses to lead men into battle when the buggers attack again. Ender Wiggin is very talented, as he wins all games, and seems to have a war-like talent. The government chooses Ender to go to battle school with them to train, and Ender is only 6 years old! I think that this is a very good book, and if you havent read it, I STRONGLY suggest you read it.
0553212540|5.0|to fully understand the relationship of art in the picture of dorian gray you must by this version.<br /><br />my review of this book is a little out of the ordinary becuase of the fac that it is an analytical essay for my 10th grade english class but after reading this it might give you a good perspective on reading this book.<br /><br />partically why i am posting it here is because iwant someone to read it because it was deemed \\"not follwing the prompt\\" by my teacher although i love her that was the worst mistake she ever made because i truly believe that this is a great essay:<br /><br />View from an Artists World<br /><br /> Oscar Wilde's way of writing is vivid, expressive and detailed.  It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art.  His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting.  It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray.  It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.<br /><br /> Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self.  He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting.  Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim.  For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art.  This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide  something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.<br /><br />Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies.  An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3).  Dorian seems to be without human emotions.  He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them.  It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties.  The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103).  In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose.  Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it.  I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul.  It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\".  Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.<br /><br />  Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him.  Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface;  \\"All art is at once surface and symbol.  Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril.  It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3).  The spectator in this story is Basil Howard.  Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence.  Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting.  Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way.  This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you.  I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him.  He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray  is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.<br /><br />A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals  about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.<br /><br />please anyone don't steal  thi sessay as your own,  because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance  of this essay in  google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.<br /><br />thank you for readingrelates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray.

It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence. <br />A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals  about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay. <br />please anyone don't steal  thi sessay as your own,  because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance  of this essay in  google and this will come right up and you will be expelled. <br />thank you for reading
B0002PZVHK|4.0|This was made to be played on a 3 speaker system...so if you have a \\"wide stereo\\" or \\"music expansion\\" button on your player push it and you will not believe all the hidden sound that appears throughout this dark and beautiful CD! <br /> <br />One of the best(ie;most interesting)ambient releases by Eno.A lot of variation here between songs,and the tracks don't go on \\"forever\\".  As one other review says here,it is not always a pleasant ,\\"new age\\" ambience...but some dark visions are nice for a change too. <br /> <br />A great place to start for those interested in Eno's version of \\"ambient\\"...if you like this,then get Eno's \\"Music For Films\\" too(or try and find the \\"Eno and Cluster\\" CDs).More cool stuff!
B000002KMY|5.0|I don't want to knock Ozzy (Diary rules!) but the music Dio made with Sabbath is clearly their best. Dio's vocal ability, in the studio and live, is outstanding and he seemed to bring Sabbath to a higher level. I never really cared for Tony's leading playing until Heaven &amp; Hell. His solos became much more melodic and emotional. His riffs were still as good as ever (Voodoo!). Bringing in Vinny Appice to replace an ailing Bill Ward was also a great choice. My favs are Turn Up The Night, Voodoo, Sign Of The Southern Cross, Mob Rules, and Falling Off The Edge Of The World. I give this album 4.5 stars. I highly recommend the Rockdetector book on Sabbath that starts with the Dio years!

(...), I'm Rick James BXXXH!    Michael Moore should come-out with a special edition called \\"FAILUREheit 9/11\\". If he though his movie would have ANYTHING to do with the 2004 election, he was sadly proven wrong yesterday. Moore's fans however have to live with the reality that the little voice in the back of thier heads telling them that Moore was full of crap was right, and worse yet, they chose to not only follow him but to award him millions and millions for the privelege of lying to them and letting them down. I *ALMOST* feel sorry for them.    \\"Dude...you just got PUNK'D!\\" - Ashton Kutcher
6305633177|5.0|...but you've still got the records when your heroes are gone. All of Metallica's 80s output is 5 star stuff; Metallica's cover versions alone wipe the floor with most bands' music(including Limp Bizkit, buddy) and this collection of (mostly) rough bootleg footage is no exception. I remember many teenage basement and rec room viewing parties when this came out, but I have one complaint: these guys have(deservedly) attained a private jet and personal chef level of success in the ensuing years, and they couldn't throw any bonus stuff on here?

B000683VI4|5.0|First and formost I must say: WOW!!!!!!!!! I used to work in a movie theater, and we all know, working at a movie theater means free movies. I had found out that The Notebook was going to be released, and I was excited. I had read the book a few times over the years, and couldn't wait to see the big screen adaptation. I went opening night, with my manager at the time, because she is as big of a fan of Nicholas Sparks as I am. All I can really say is I am glad I wasn't ushering that night, otherwise, I would literally be standing in a lake of tears. Of course I went right back and payed for my second ticket and watched it again.  Still the same reaction.  <br />  To make a long story short, I ended up seeing The Notebook 4 different times, with 4 different people, and each time, I ended blochy eyed, and wearing a tear stained shirt, (and not to many guys will admit to crying during a movie). This movie was incredibly well done, the acting was more then amazing, the cinematography was gorgeous, and the music was extremly well done. All in all, all I can say about this movie, is Best Picture worthy. I urge all to go out on the release date of Feb. 8th (subject to change), and buy it, and watch it with someone you love. <br />  For the women (and gay guys), James Marsten is what we would call, eye candy. His acting, unfortunatly, wasn't as good as all expected, but what can you expect from someone who played cyclops.  For the men (and lesbians, can't forget them), Rachel McAdams is more then eye candy. Her preformance was more then best actress worthy. She made the audience believe that love comes as natural as sending roses on Valentine's day. <br />  For the older folks (and believe me, there were a LOT in the theater), James Garner and Genna Rowland were the perfect on screen couple. They made my heart melt, with every comment they made. <br />   In all this movie was just wonderful, and I don't think that anything bad can be said about it at all (except that it had to end).  It deserves beyond the five stars that I rated it (hint hint amazon mediators). I insist, no I demand, that you all go out and buy this movie.  Enjoy a good cry, and don't forget to have lots of tissues on hand, believe me you're gonna need them.
B000002U9L|5.0|LABYRINTH remains as one of best examples of a fairy tale movie made right that has ever been made.  Jim Henson successfully combined muppets, live actors, and bizarre sets to create one of the best fantasy movies of all time. Adding to those elements is the unique soundtrack of the film. All of the musical numbers by David Bowie and most of the original music composed by Trevor Jones is contained on this album. I bought the album because I loved the movie. Out of all the music and songs it contains, \\"Magic Dance\\" is the one that stands out above the rest. It's the only song on the album that I find myself playing over and over and over and over again. There are several other interesting tunes, but the album is worth buying alone just to have \\"Magic Dance.\\"
0312995423|3.0|It's a fast read with a lot of plot twists that leave you hanging at the end of each chapter. But most of the comments posted by other people here are accurate. The end chapter is a little cheesy, you'll probably figure out what the code says several pages before the characters do, and there are some big technical holes. <br /> <br />The two biggest technicalities are: the firewall filters they have on the main computer at the end makes no sense, and 64 bits and 64 characters are NOT the same thing. The last one was probably the single most annoying fault, and I'm surprised by it considering Dan Brown has one of his favorite books listed as a book on cryptography! If you're doing crypto, you had certainly better know that in ASCII, 8 bits = 1 byte and 1 byte = 1 character, or 4 bytes = 1 integer value. Using these basics, 64-bits = 8 bytes (or 8 characters) and 64 bytes = 64 characters (or 512 bits). There's a big difference there. <br /> <br />But in the end, it all comes down to a single integer value that could be represented by 2 bits. So it was all a bunch of unnecessary page padding. <br /> <br />You don't really need to know a lot about computers to read this. In typical Dan Brown fashion, he explains the basics and then re-iterates the same points over and over.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Anybody who actually wastes their time seeing this film should realize after watching it just how stupid and petty it really is.  I am sorry that Michael Moore calls himself an American.  He is a bon-bon eating bleeding heart liberal who needs to wake up and shut up.  It is interesting how much Moore wants to get the \\"facts\\" to the American people right before Election Day.  The documentary is just as the filmmaker is, garbage.
B000294SFW|5.0|Motorhead came back with their best release in years. The songs are fast and catchy at the same time. I honestly didn't expect much but was blown away by songs such as In the Name of Tragedy and In the Black.  <br /> <br />I would just like to suggest to Motorhead and other bands, while I am at it, to do away with putting multimedia presentations and other stuff on their cd's. I buy cd's to listen to their music and that's it. The multimedia presentation on this cd somehow conflicts with some of my computer software when I try to play this cd at work and it takes forever to try to close the application, get my computer up to speed (and it's a good computer) and just play the music.
0930289234|5.0|Let me start this review off by saying that this work isn't your typical superhero/supervillian comic, in fact it's just the opposite. Alan Moore, whom wrote this and wrote several other sucessful comics like Swamp Thing, is a brilliant writer. He's really created a world that is unlike anything you've ever read. What makes Alan Moore a very different comic writer is the fact that he does not like the idea of superheroes or supervillians. He created this story, in my opinion, with hopes of destroying and demoralizing the idea of superheroes.<br /><br />This story is very complex. There are alot of backstories and flashbacks.<br /><br />It doesn't really do me any good to try to explain the story to you, because it's very complicated. I will say that if you haven't read this comic than you're missing out on the greatest comic ever written. This comic tackles issues of morality, friendships, politics, sex, religion, and everything in between.<br /><br />Like I said, if you do not have this graphic novel, then you need to get it.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Wow!what can I say?Since I'm a christian(a follower of THE Living Christ)it was my duty to go see this movie.Jesus's death wasn't pretty and there is alot that this film doesn't have in it,but I don't care.I know that everybody is entiteled to their own opinion,but this movie IS NOT anti-semetic.Another thing is that yes it it graphic,but I've seen worse(The Thing,Saving Private Ryan,Jason X,etc.)It is a very,very good movie.
6305609705|5.0|There are few movies that I believe exhibit sheer brilliance.  To me, I thought 12 O'Clock High and The Sixth Sense fit this category.  Apocalypse Now is an absolutely brilliant movie about the travels of Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) who is given a classified assignment to track down a rogue Colonel, Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) in Cambodia.<br /><br />When preparing to write a review for this movie, I was looking for a word to describe it.  I thought maybe oxymoron or dichotomous, but neither word was right.  A previous reviewer (James Kunz) used the perfect word for this movie, incongruous.<br /><br />The movie revolves around Capt. Willard's journey via boat to Cambodia.  The journey shows the illogical life the young soldiers led in Vietnam.  The soldiers were boys who liked to play, but were required to do the job of men and kill the enemy.  This was illustrated in many scenes, such as Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore's (Robert Duvall) orchestrating an intense offensive attack against the enemy during which he was worried about surfing.  Kilgore orders in air strikes to make the beach safe from snipers.  A short time later, Kilgore calmly talks about (with the now famous line) how \\"I love the smell of Napalm in the morning\\" in a scene were seemingly heaven and hell collide behind him.  Throughout the journey to Cambodia, there are scenes that show the incongruous nature of the war.  At one point, the boat's gunners mate, Lance Johnson is water skiing behind the boat.  During the journey, seemingly out of nowhere, a brightly lit state for the USO show suddenly appears.  The scene as the boat approaches the Do Lung bridge shows a serene, festively lit bridge amidst a fierce artillery battle.  Finally, when Capt. Willard finds the \\"wicked\\" Col. Kurtz, the Col. appears to be constructing a utopian society with Montagnards and ex-Gis in the middle of the war.<br /><br />My meager words could never do the movie justice.  While I never been in a war, I feel that this movie does a good job of portraying the confusion and irrationality people experience in war.  If you are looking for a classic shoot'em up, blood and guts war movie, this is not it.  I would recommend the movie to someone looking for an intellectually stimulating thriller.that this movie does a good job of portraying the confusion and irrationality people experience in war.

B00063MBU8|5.0|Ok, I love Simple Plan, and I have actually heard the album, many times actually. Well, I love this CD some people may not but I do. By the way people don't go around saying they are a discrace to rock or whatever, because they aren't rock so dont get all pissy.
B0000640VN|3.0|Okay.  We've heard it before.  There are no gentlemen left in the world and chivalry is dead.  Leave it to director James Mangold to create a film that solves the modern female conundrum: rather than proving that chivalry does exist in a modified form, simply yank a proper gentleman from the 19th century and plop him down in the streets of New York.  I have to admit, I went into this film with the lowest expectations.  I wanted to hate it.  I wanted to laugh at its stupidity and cast it aside as a poorly written, female rant about the carelessness of men that failed to take into consideration the negative sides of traditional chivalry and societal roles.<br /><br />And I did laugh.  But I also found myself entertained.  _Kate and Leopold_ does not descend into a rant, but rather chooses to focus on the humorous clash between the modern world and that of Duke Leopold of Albany (played by Hugh Jackman).  So while it still falls into all of the well-worn ruts of the romantic comedy, finding once again that fated true love is a reality, it escapes these constraints by offering up the hilarious dynamic of Leopold's adjustment to the modern world.  In fact, while many write about Meg Ryan's performance in the film, I feel that she is completely secondary to Leopold's own quest and that she merely provides the background for Jackman's performance.  Jackman steals the movie and one has to wonder how long Meg Ryan can continue to fill these roles.<br /><br />While the movie does throw some dirt in the face of the feminist movement, I don't think that one should analyze the film that carefully-it is a romantic comedy, let us remember.  Try the film if you'd like to see Hugh Jackman or if you'd like to see the culture clash between the last two centuries.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|Jennifer Lopez can sing...NO SHE CAN'T. This album is a joke. She is one of the worst singers I have ever heard (right next to Briteny Spears). Her album wasn't even all that. She had 3 decent songs. She sounds like a cat being drowned.  <br /> <br />Miss Lopez needs to brush up on her acting and keep the singing to the professionals.
B00003CXS4|4.0|_Snatch_ is a hard-hitting, fast-paced, fun film.  From the opening of the film, where we are introduced to the gigantic cast of misfits (each with hilarious nicknames and wonderful rich personas), _Snatch_ takes the audience on an incredibly entertaining and hilarious adventure that is a delight to watch.  While many have criticized the film for being a copy of _Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_, or a sequel to that film, I would argue that it is exactly what we wanted.  While I would love to see Guy Ritchie extend himself beyond his current scope, I think that he does what he does really well.  I loved his first film and I loved _Snatch_.  At the end of the day, a good cockney gangster film is still a good film.  Period.<br /><br />_Snatch_ is a success because of its characters, many of whom I would love to see explored further in other films-Brad Pitt's performance as an Irish Gypsy Boxer is an obvious frontrunner of the pack.  These characters are allowed to develop and display their quirky selves, largely due to the wonderfully written script.  The dialogue in this film is stunning-both engaging and hilarious at the same time.<br /><br />Once again, I simply do not know what people are talking about when they describe the film as a difficult one.  The accents are not hard to decipher at all, with the exception of Brad Pitt's character.  In those instances where the dialogue does fall off, it seems utterly intentional on Ritchie's part and adds to the character development in the film.  Secondly, the movie's multiple storylines are spliced rather well and I do not think that the average film viewer will have trouble piecing together the plot.  As has been stated, the plot is not complicated in the least-it is simply how Ritchie spices up an old, well-traveled story.<br /><br />If you want to have a good time watching a British gangster film, give _Snatch_ a look.  You will not be disappointed.

Wow. What a beautiful, enraged, adoring, curious, imaginative, pensive, wonderous, transcendent, sweet, observant, sensitive collection of poems this is.     Howl is a brilliant imagining of a generation of souls careening through existence, full of action and movement. The famous opening line, \\"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked...\\" sets off a force of vivid description and incredible depth. Howl continues through the devious Moloch, to rest in Rockland where his love laid. A Supermarket in California is sweet understanding, peaceful and simple in public. In the other poems live the Sun's power, life exposed in the presense of dead flowers and the baggage of life. In Song, the most gorgeous of the collection, love's force is bowed down to. And in America Ginsberg asks questions that almost 50 years later I wonder on, and wish for answers to.    This is a classic little book. Full of infinite beauty and life. Something I can return to over and over.
B00005JMYI|4.0|Will Ferrell comes alive in _Anchorman_, once again proving that he is one of the few talented acts to come out of the SNL machine in quite some time.  Whenever you're watching a comedy whose talent is a bit low on the sophisticated meter, you have to be enthralled by the characters and the actors who play them.  Ferrell delivers in spades and, while the plot spins around and goes nowhere, he manages to continually delight the audience with his own brand of humor.  Bottom line, if you love Will Ferrell and his style of comedy, you will love _Anchorman_.  If you don't, shop elsewhere.<br /><br />The premise of the film is a hilarious look at the power of reporters during the \\"golden age\\" of local television.  The character of Ron Burgandy is absolutely hilarious and it is a delight to see a chauvinistic icon struggle with what he views as an invasion by women in the workforce.  My only complaint with the film is the same complaint that I have with many of the comedies that are being released these days.  These comedies seem to be based off quick sketch ideas, many of which are spawned from Saturday Night Live and the like.  The problem with this formula is that many of these sketches are hard to sustain over a couple of minutes, let alone a feature length film.  One gets the impression that these films, including _Anchorman_, would be truly dynamite if they could just restrict themselves to an hour.  The \\"90 minute\\" comedy rule is just too long for these films to sustain their interest, forcing them to sag at many points.<br /><br />That being said, _Anchorman_ still receives my approval.  Each time I have seen it, I have been laughing out loud and forced to tears at a few spots.  Will Ferrell's performance is stunning and I think he is truly one of the most gifted comedic actors working these days.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I have to say that Scarface is the best movie ever! I loved Al Pacino, Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Al Pacino performance as Tony Montana is flawless! No matter how many times I watch this movie it doesn't loose it's edge one bit! They just don't make movies like this anymore. Al Pacino plays the gangster roll to a tee. One of my favorite scenes is when he is drunk in the restaurant and he delivers the 'bad guy' speech. This tells you what kind of guy Tony Montana is...fearless and ruthless. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as well as her character doesn't take any nonsense from Tony...She wasn't afraid to express herself around him at all...His right hand guy, Manolo, was outstanding in the supporting roll. Superb performances by all, especially Pacino. One of the greatest endings of all time. A must see and must own film.  I watch this movie all the time and I am always saying lines from the movie... and to me that makes it a damn great movie!  <br />  <br />  <br />
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|I was knocked out by _Mystic River_.  It truly lived up to the hype that had surrounded it for the months that I failed to see it in the theaters.  Flawlessly directed by Clint Eastwood, _Mystic River_ has all of its bases covered-great filmmaking, directing, script, actors, etc.  In the end, however, this movie comes down to the quality of the acting.  Everyone is in this film.  And I mean everyone.  While Sean Penn steals the show in my book, his character has to compete with Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney.  Everyone does a superb job and together they create a film that will quickly become a classic.<br /><br />Many have knocked the film for its \\"unsatisfying\\" ending.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  One has to wonder what these audience members expected-a happy, Hollywood ending where everyone joins hands and dances around the Maypole?  Had _Mystic River_ fallen to these stale devices, the film would have blown up and taken hits for wasting all of its potential.<br /><br />In my opinion, faulting this film for not having a \\"satisfying\\" ending is just to fundamentally disagree about what \\"satisfying\\" entails.  If you want a \\"popcorn\\" flick that satisfies your desire to turn off your heart for ninety minutes, do not rent this film-it will not \\"satisfy\\" you.  But if you want an original film with a compelling storyline and complex morality, this film definitely \\"satisfies.\\"  The emotions in this film are real.  The actors are real.  The performances are real.  Robbins haunting performance at the end of the film is real.  Are there loose ends?  Yeah.  Does the film leave you wondering?  Sure.  Is it a happy ending?  No way.  But all of these facts point to the very reason that the film succeeds.
0385474547|5.0|This incredible novel is a great read that celebrates the hero and failure in us all.

B00003CXPJ|1.0|_Zoolander_ is, quite possibly, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I say this, as I look in utter shock at the amount of positive praise this movie has received.  Normally, I would simply say \\"to each his own,\\" but this film does not permit that sort of allowance.  I love comedies-it is one of my favorite genres of film.  But this film is just plain stupid.  Not only that, everyone seems to admit it, yet tries to defend its stupidity by remarking about its addictive quality.  While there are a few funny moments throughout the film, _Zoolander_ left me bored and tired with its childishness and stupidity.  Stiller based this film off of a sketch, a sketch that, in my opinion, should have been left on the floor.  There is simply not enough comedy here to prop up a feature-length film, even at 90 minutes.  Despite my review, I will send out praise for Will Ferrell who does a great job with his character and supplies the film with its (albeit little) quote ability.<br /><br />How can my peers describe this film as the one of the greatest comedies of the modern generation and one of the funniest films of all time?  It is not a work of genius.  It is not a clever satire about our culture's obsession with fashion.  Many have compared the film to _Austin Powers_ and, though the comparison hurts my teeth, even _Dr. Strangelove_.  Comparing _Zoolander_ to these two films is like comparing an evening of fine dining at a respected restaurant to popping a bowl of Uncle Ben's rice into a microwave.  My advice to all those reading these comparisons is to check out those two films instead of picking up this one.  _Zoolander_ comes off as a film that probably took two seconds to conceptualize and another two minutes to write the script.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|i am a pretty big Nightwish fan. about 2 years ago when i first heard of them, i immediately went out to buy Angels Fall First, Oceanborn, and Wishmaster. then i got Century Child, and then nothing. finally after a long time of waiting, Nightwish returns with the latest album, Once, and it just made my heart melt and my mind implode. this album is beautifully written. it has more of a hard-rock/metal element to it, a la, it is harder than their previous album. there is certainly a growth to be seen on this album. Tuomas has really outdone himself with the transformation of the band. they have a somewhat evolved sound that might seem different, but it's still the same Nightwish sound we've all come to love. Tarja's voice just grows more beautiful with every track. i really dig \\"Nemo,\\" that song is amazing. i'm not too fond of the lead single, \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" but it's still the surreal beauty that Nightwish has brought me for years. in conclusion, buy it. this is a great album.  <br /> <br />*on a personal note, why isn't Nightwish's Once released on their normal, Century Media records. why is Roadrunner buying up all the good bands? I hope RR doesn't screw up these good bands and make them sound like ass. Nigthwish is the second band i know aside from 69 Eyes that got switched to Roadrunner.

0156027321|3.0|This book is well written with a good plot. But I would dismiss any statement claiming more than that. It does not deliver profound philosophy or ethical discussion. It just seems to attend the average story-telling of our times, some shallow moral discussion combined with the much needed violent twists. I won't be surprised if someone makes a film of it real soon, It will apply perfectly.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Unlike like quite a bit of the general populace (although I hardly think of myself as general), I have seen the subtitled original release of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.  I am also a huge fan of what Disney is doing for America's exposure to anime (if not a huge fan of Disney itself).  I've seen the original subtitled, as well as the dubbed, versions of all of Miyazaki's films brought to America by Disney and I have no complaints.  Most of the voice actors that Disney chooses are fairly accurate for what was originally portrayed in the Japanese releases and Disney didn't butcher the translations (well, not in too many cases). <br /> <br />Anyway, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is one of my favorite Miyazaki films (if not THE favorite), and I am ecstatic that Disney is bringing it to us.  I love this movie and I have illiterate adult friends that couldn't watch the subtitled version and I was afraid they might never be able to.  I'm surprised Disney hasn't done this sooner, as they brought Spirited Away very quickly to the U.S. despite containing some of the more abstract Taoist beliefs that most children wouldn't understand.  Nausicaa seems to be right up Disney's alley, sporting some of the more environmentalist ideals prevelent in some of their other films. As you may have noticed, I have no intentions of giving you a synopsis of the movie as that's what online film databases are for.  Just rest assured that this is a fun film that is easily enjoyed by people of any age.
B000085RTZ|5.0|Yes, this is melodic metal.But this is far more beautifully arranged than Rhapsody, not overdone and not over the top.The singer can hit the high notes, but only when is necessary.The riffs are very well thought out and they do not sound tired.The music and vocal lines: highly melodical but with finesse and restrain and a darker, melancholic feeling unlike Sonata Arctica.Besides, they don't copy themselves like Stratovarius does.In other words: they have a niche of their own within the melodic metal realm. <br />With The Fourth Legacy, they made and excellent title track and the rest of the material was very good, but failed to achieve the grandeur of that particular song.In Karma, they made an album of more consistent material but they didn't have an athem  song like The Fourth Legacy.Epica, achieves the rare goal of having mostly excellent songs.And for my money, they surpased even the Conception: In Your Multitude album (Khan ex-band). <br />Don't miss this jewel! <br />
B0002JJBZE|4.0|In case anyone is wondering, the musical cue that was missing from the original DVD release of the Doomsday Machine episode (heard right after Kirk says \\"I'm gonna ram her right down that thing's throat\\") has been restored in this box set.  So, props to Paramount for that.<br /><br />As for the rest of the set, well, it is what it is.  If you're reading this, you probably don't require synopses of each episode on it.  If you like the show already, and if you can handle the hefty price tag, get it.
1401301010|4.0|I got this book because I wanted to see how someone like Anthony lived. He has had a very unconventional life--getting into drugs and sex with 20 year olds when he was 13 and 14, getting into hardcore addiction in his 20s, being homeless, becoming famous, touring all the time, etc.<br /><br />I alwas thought the Chili Peppers sucked until they matured and began writing more thoughtful songs, but as a story of a totally crazy-acting (but not really that crazy, when he explians it to you) guy, this is entertaining to a total square like me.<br /><br />The only thing that cold have improved this was more about the early alternative scene in the '80s, but Anthony was such a druggie, he maybe didn't really know.<br /><br />Also, there are many laugh out loud scens here, like when he has to look outside at traffic to see if it's dusk or dawn whenever he wakes up from a drug stupor. And when he holds a hunger strike to get a leather jacket on discount.
B00005ATQF|5.0|To keep it brief, this is quite possibly the best war film ever. I have watched it over and over and never get tired of it. It's based on Gustav Hasford's \\"The Short-Timers\\".
0679805273|5.0|Although I had this book given to me when I graduated from college, I really didn't read it until recently.  I loved the cover so kept it.  Unlike most folks, I didn't have Dr. Suess books when I was little, so I really didn't know what laid in store for me.  Wow!  Like a bomb, I was absorbed in the simple yet meaningful book.  It was like God had given this book to me for my \\"waiting room\\" phase.  I just got out of the hospital and am running behind on everything.  After reading this book, I am still climbing the mountain but a little faster!
B0006AZMFM|5.0|Delta goodrem - a million words to describe her, yet only one way to really describe her music: Wonderful tunes, voice and great heartfelt words!<BR>Mistaken Identity is her Second album, and is sure to be a huge hit, alike her first album, Innocent Eyes, which has sold amazingly in Australia. On average, one in 20 Australians own Innocent Eyes, and the same is expected for Mistaken Identity. It has a great feeling to it... a story to Delta's ups and downs in the past year. Samples from Mistaken Identity have stunned listeners with Her great voice.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|i am not gonna concentrate on other reviews from ignorant listeners but, who never heard of guns n roses and how great they were?? <br />i was born around 1985, so i started listening to them when i grew old, and they r a phenomenon. <br />lets see, <br />Paradise city, Sweet child of mine, November rain , Bob Delan's great one : Knocking on heavin's door, and ofcoure welcome to the jungle, are some of the best songs that the 80's generated for us. If u like atleast one of thier songs, u gotta get the album. I had to get it shipped to me here to iraq only a few days after i hit ground <br />then again, be diverse and universal and dont give bad ratings to kinds of music u dont even listen to; thats not part of the listener's ethics <br /> <br />and his tight pants is his business; its the music that matters <br />
0679411585|5.0|An important resource for those who watched the movie and were horrified at the loss of life and lack of direction within the battle.  In addition to telling a gripping story (the movie ends halfway through the actual events), General Moore and his collaborator provide excellent insights into the goals, tactics, successes and limitations of airmobile assault in the Vietnam conflict.  Although the importance of the clashes in the Ia Drang valley in shaping the future course of the war are a continuing source of debate, the detail and immediacy of this account will inform and entertain readers interested in the first combat test of the airmobile concept and the first battle between U.S. forces and the North Vietnamese Army.
B0001NIUWG|5.0|I agree with the other two reviews here but I have to upgrade the stars because although it contains no Queen music, this documentary goes into wonderful depth of the often glossed over pre-Queen years of Smile, Ibex and other bands. There are in-depth interviews with people who were there and they have a unique perspective on the personalities of this amazing band. This is not a typical unauthorized quickie, but a well produced documentary giving a unique angle on the history of the band. There are also lots of great archival interviews with the band members. I was touched by this film as it reminded me of the incredible legacy of Freddie Mercury.
076790592X|4.0|I thought this book was easy to read, yet it taught life's great lessons. I believe that this book is especially important for teenagers, like me, because Mitch Albom stresses the idea that materialism shouldn't control your life. In today's world, materialism is what keeps most people living and in this book, the reader learns what really is important in life, and how you should really live your life. A relationship between a professor and his student it created, which allows the reader to become even more addicted to reading this novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who isn't narrow minded, and someone who enjoys simple yet inspiring books.
B000021YQV|3.0|This album is pretty good because of 3 songs: Toxicity (of course), Bounce and Chop Suey. These three songs stand out in all the album making me even not to renember all the other songs names. That's why only 3 stars: 1 for Toxicity, 1 for Bounce and 3-rd for Chop suey. Sorry but thats a fact nothing more to hear in this album, really.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Sergio Leone was literally born into the tradition and world of Cinema. He grew up using the Cinecitta Studio as his playhouse. He worked his way up through the ranks, and was directing films by 1961. It was in 1964 that he directed FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, and made movie history. After completing the DOLLAR trilogy, he really did not want to make another western. He went to Hollywood with his script for ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, the Jewish crime opus. Paramount said they were interested in it, but with the priviso that he direct a couple of westerns first. And so ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST was launched as a project.<br /><br />It was the first Spaghetti western to be shot outside of Europe, and the only one to have scenes shot in the Monument Valley. He had studied all nine John Ford films that had utilized the Monument Valley, and he had memorized all the locales. He took a couple hundred pounds of red dust from it back to Italy, and for the scene in Lionel Stander's bar, he blew it into the air, and sprinkled it on the shoulders and hats of his actors.<br /><br />The cinematography for this film was remarkable, done by the veteran lenser Tonino Deli Colli. He and Leone pioneered the use of the Techniscope process, whereby spherical lenses were used that would not distort on extreme close ups. Of course, Leone also used his close friend Ennio Morricone to write the film score. Oddly, Morricone finished the score in advance, and Leone had to film the movie like it was an opera, composing the shots around the music. Morricone is a musical genius. To date he has scored music on over 500 films.<br /><br />Leone, while writing the script for this movie, enlisted the aid of two of his buddies, Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento. They screened dozens of classic westerns while writing. It is said that it was Bertolucci's idea to use a woman as the central character. There is a story that Leone contacted his trio of DOLLLAR actors, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach to be in OUTITW. They were interested until they found out he wanted them for the opening scene, and that he would have killed them off immediately.<br /><br />Leone was a huge fan of those sprawling Japanese Samurai epics, and he loved the way the sword fight scenes were set up and shot. He put this premise into action with both the prologue and denouement for this film; the long opening sequence and the final gunflight between Frank and Harmonica. In the opening sequence, dazzling in its execution, Leone could not match any of Morricone's pre-canned music to the action, so he came up with the idea of using amlified and exaggerated natural sounds. It was very effective. The three principles in the opening scene were lovingly introduced and then dispatched quickly. I loved the fact that Woody Strode had no dialogue, and still created a memorable character. I was upset when Jack Elam spoke, and what we heard was a dubbed voice. Leone always looped his films post-production. Maybe Elam was not available for that.<br /><br />It was interesting that most of Leone's casting was against type. To use Henry Fonda as the heavy, sensing his darker nature and his cold side, was a masterstroke. To use Jason Robards as a Mexican outlaw was a bit of a stretch, but Robards was a good enough actor to make the role his own. Claudia Cardinale was a terrific choice for the female lead. She had the beauty of a Sophia Loren, and the strength of an Anna Magnini. Charles Bronson was perfect as the silent brooding stranger--the man with almost no name--Harmonica; a man with a burning secret, bent on revenge. James Coburn was first considered for the part, but he was unavailable.<br /><br />American critics did not rave about this film. For me, most of the critics of the 60's just did not know what to make of this opus. Leone's love for American westerns shined through. Somehow he managed to bridge the vast chasm between classic Ford country within the Monument Valley and the tinnycynical world of the Euro Western. I felt that despite the implausible plot, Sergio Leone created a very complex epic Western, steeped in tradition, that continues to haunt us today, as it stands shoulder to shoulder with many of the classic westerns of John Ford, Howard Hawks, and George Stevens.ley and the tinny cynical world of the Euro Western.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I must admitt that before this album I only heard just the song \\"Wait and bleed\\" but now I must say I'm a fan of Slipknot. The albums lyrics are full of hate and passion and I must admit it pumps me up with energy. After hearing this i definetly want to get Slipknot's earlier albums.
B00006690G|5.0|I think people need to realize that this man is a poet.  I've been listening to hip hop my whole life and never heard anybody rhyme like him.  People listen for a beat and think it's great but don't hear the words.  Eminem could rap without music and still be Platinum but people just don't see it.  Instead they judge him for things he does yet 80% of hip hop artists do the same thing?  Give respect where it's due.  This man can entertain, give you chills and puts you there when he speaks.
B00005QENZ|4.0|I bought this disk for one song, \\"Line Up\\", playing when Ace is chasing down the Miami Dolphins to check their Super Bowl rings. Of course I'd heard this album's hit songs, \\"Crazy\\", \\"Cryin'\\", \\"Amazin'\\", which are all decent songs, and fun to play along with on the guitar. Overall, good listening, though a little generic, rock n roll.
B0000X81ZI|4.0|Kill Bill is a movie that takes place in the strange and dark world of hidden but powerful mafias. It is these mafias that although we don't see everyday but it is about us all the time that is fast shaping the world, a world in which is moving from a statist approach unlike ever before. If you think of past events like Waco, the Oklahoma bombing or even the 9-11 attacks, then Kill Bill is just a small chapter that would  have tied, if it were true, all these tragic events together.      If anything, the  violence associated with the growth and development of these mafias especially  in the movie represents the characteristics of the mafia world itself, with their assassins, the quest for power and their ability to go in and out of the underworld to the 'real' world in which we live and go about and do with our every day daily life. Remember it was a wedding that serves as a motif in which the character plays by Uma Thurma lies in a coma for four years that once she wakes up seeks revenge on Bill and his Divas. In fact betrayal and revenge are the major themes that makes this movie come alive and not seem comatose in the violence that borrows its traits from old spaghetti western, 70s style Kung fu movies and so on.    Yet who is to say that the director and producer aim was to hit at male teenagers and adults with its dependence of kung fu scenes filled with lots of limbs being cut off and people being hacked to death. It is naive and even foolish to assert such precisely the anime scenes in the movie of the character who represents probably in Japan itself an onging pop culture trend that has suddenly emerged onto the international scene. It is also untrue given the fact that other horror movies like Exorcist: The Beginning had a wide appeal among female movie goers. Then again it would also be wierd to assert otherwise that 'why not' cater to people like myself who likes to see martial art stunts and bodies being thrown about left and right.    Kill Bill is no doubt  a must see movie. It could however worked on parts such as the fighting scene with Thurma and Black Mamba in which case the daughter would have known something wasn't right when she comes home from school and see glass knocked on the floor and broken furniture. I would supppose a child like that would have felt that something was wrong right there and so too the audience.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over.  It touches me in different ways each time.
0465043550|5.0|\\"This book will not make you rich..\\" was one of the author's statements; and nothing could be further from the truth.  Through everyday prose Mandelbrot shares vignettes of his remarkable family life, his thoughts on life, averages, the composition of the world, and of course, markets.  Rarely have I been prodded to stop, think and ultimately agree with the author on many of his concepts.  Make no mistake about it; this is a simple book (on complex market issues) that rewards the reader with wealth far greater than trading strategies or \\"hot stocks\\".
B0006213WG|4.0|I basiclly got what I expected with this Cd which was a Great Release from Sum41. I have every cd by them and they have definitley changed, which id say is a good thing. Im so sick of people calling Sum41 pop punk. They are far from pop punk,They are much better than many pop punk bands, Not the most talented Band but still very good. Many quality songs are on this album, although a tiny bit repetive, still a great Cd. I think they have matured alot and their music reflects it. I can't wait for there next album which I think will be even better.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|After regretting my purchase of Celine's Live album, I thought she was in a rut with some of the music she was putting out, but I'm relieved that I bought this cd now because its a nice return to excellence for her. Celine's rendition of Lennon's \\"Beautiful Boy\\" is worth buying this cd. Very soothing melodies with her angel voice. Welcome back, Celine!
078322804X|5.0|It's been rumored that a re-release for the 25th anniversary will be coming out, so nobody fret about the DVD no longer existing. As far as I know, it will be the orginal theatrical cut and much shorter, just for the musical numbers. So everybody just hold out for the anniverary edition and everything will be okay.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I don't even know who Mike is, but reading other reviews of these videos makes me wonder if the wine and cheese bunch is invading sci-fi.<br /><br />In short, these movies are far better than the originals and, if you haven't seen the originals for a few years, you probably won't even notice other than the exceptional video quality.<br /><br />Look, Lucas is forming a story here, one he's only now in the midst of completing. As the story develops he realizes the importance of maintaining a continuum. Some people don't even realize yet that Sen. Palpatine is the emporer.<br /><br />My advice is to buy this title in widescreen, watch it and just enjoy. This isn't da Vinci, you know. It's just movies. Get a life, and if you want an original, muddy transfer with dust and debris, go sign a petition online somewhere.<br /><br />These are great.
B000059PPN|2.0|This movie is alright, but I wouldn't pay $17.98 for it. It's confusing and the acting is bad, which is somewhat on par for a Fulci film. Unforunately, there isn't enough gore to offset these factors. <br /> <br />I got it in the Horror Rises from the Grave set w/ 3 other movies for $7.  <br /> <br />It's worth seeing, but the only really memorable scene is the ver first one.
B000002G87|4.0|This album is a real snapshot in time.  I think Eric was so tired of being \\"God\\" that he decided all he wanted to do was to be in a working band.  Thus Derek and the Dominos were created.  There's really no music like it, either.  There are so many influences that it all becomes a melting pot of raw emotion and energy that defies description.  Mr. Clapton dissolves himself in a sea of desperate vocals and cascading, battling guitar licks that are ever-present and unrelenting in their ferocity.  It's many flaws give it timeless character and a uniqueness that will never be matched.  The sound has a brittle edge that only helps to reinforce the urgency of the music.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Sure, this record isn't flawless - there's a lot of good stuff missing (\\"Polly\\" and the In Utero version of \\"All Apologies\\" come to mind). But based on what actually *did* make the cut, how could I give it anything less than a perfect grade? Songs like \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"Dumb\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\" sound every bit as beautiful and as URGENT as they did ten years ago, and the \\"new\\" song, while not a revelation, certainly holds it's own as well. I love Nirvana, and this little collection reminded me why. New fans - pick this up!
B0006213WG|5.0|This is problably in contention with \\"Does This Look Infected?\\" for the best album by Sum 41. It has many great songs, some of them being my favorite songs by Sum 41. My favorite songs on this album are: <br /> <br />No Reason( best song on the album) <br />We're All To Blame <br />Open Your Eyes <br />Track 16(untitled) <br /> <br />Although these are my favorites, all of the songs are extremely good and well written. If you are a fan of their previous work, espescially Does This Look Infected?, you should buy this album.
0385513755|5.0|I am so glad that I bought the special edition of this book.  I had just begun reading the original, when I learned of the  special edition.  I put down the first and began the illustrated version.  I imagine that people will want to re-read this novel and gain the wonderful insight that the special edition offers.<br /><br />I highly recommend the newer version!
B00004LN16|4.0|There may be nothing on this album as instantly recognizable as \\"Highway To Hell\\" or \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", but the riffs are catchy and George Young completely out-produces Rick Rubin (who did \\"Ballbreaker\\"). <br /> <br />The songs flow smoothly with no great high points and no need to program out any bad songs either, and that's actually quite an achievement. The music is a bit bluesier than usual, and if most of the choruses are less memorable than some of AC/DC's best work, \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" seems a more mature record (or less immature, anyway), without being introvert or lacking in energy. <br /> <br />All in all, I'd say that among the Brian Johnson-era albums, only \\"Back In Black\\" and \\"The Razor's Edge\\" are significantly better records than this one. And that's actually pretty great praise!
6304981635|4.0|I think that all Bruce Lee films are the greatest. I like Hong Kong films and think that despite the cheesy technique and storylines, they are so bad that they're good. <br />   Now that I've told you that much, you'll trust my judgement when I say that this movie screwed itself out of a five star rating. It's because all Bruce Lee and most Hong Kong movies, have nudity. It's usually sexual too! I don't see why they have to be so perverted and add some nude woman! <br />  In this movie in preticular, the nudity is that when the fighters go to the tournament, they get these hookers to go to the rooms. Each of the men get one, but Bruce of course is too cool for any play, and he declines. But it shows the other fighters with their women, and it shows a couple women's breasts, and some bare butts. <br />   Other than that, this movie is great! But it just sort of ruins the story when they do that.
068987474X|5.0|I got this book because I have heard so much about it.  I am not a person who likes to read self help books, but I do like reading books funny books about the single life.  My dating life is very humorous so why not read a book that is based on that? <br /> <br />When I first read this book I thought it was silly because I thought it was all common sense.  It was very funny and did have some good points, but I just didn't think it applied to me.  Since I have read this, I have based this book on so many situations, mine and others.  I met a guy this weekend and we had a wonderful connection, I left thinking he was going to call.  He hasn't called.  I have to admit, I am upset and when talking to my friends we always try to evaluate the situation, all I can think is...truely he just wasn't that into me.   <br /> <br />Point is, any single girl or a girl in a questionable relationship should read this book.  It stays in your mind and you will find yourself reading it over again.
B000268QB2|3.0|If you like Keane, you should own Travis.  In fact, I'm not sure Keane isn't really Travis in disguise. <br /> <br />Go buy Travis & Star Sailor.   <br /> <br />If you like that stuff, but find it a little dull, go buy Muse. <br /> <br />If you find Muse too simplistic you're ready for Radiohead. <br /> <br />If you're like me, you respect this music in that it's not hip hop, but are ultimately disappointed in the fact that it's totally derivative of stuff that's less than 3 years old.
0385659806|4.0|This book is a story told from the perspective of an autistic fourteen year-old boy, who sets out to write a murder mystery about the neighbour's dog who he finds dead and speared by a pitchfork. Determined to be a good detective, like Sherlock Holmes, this boy sets out to solve the mystery. In the course of his investigation, he uncovers much more than he bargained for and undergoes a life-changing experience (if I tell you more, it'll ruin it).<br />What is truly singular about this book is the way Haddon has captured the essence of this (supposedly) mentally-disabled boy-genius. His writing brings to life the thought processes of such a child. This boy simply sees the world from a completely different perspective. What is mundane to us is over-stimulating to him. He sees beauty in things we overlook, has joy in the patterns of the world and thinks of things very specifically.<br />Read this book to change your perceptions of the &quot;mentally-challenged.&quot; It was a humbling experience for me. My appreciation grew as I realized this boy was far beyond me in his ability to perceive and appreciate the world. Unfortunately, his troubles stem from the fact that he is simply not in the majority. The world is designed for &quot;ordinary people,&quot; not the extra-ordinary. Perhaps, as more people read this book, their awareness will make it a little softer for the extra-ordinary.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Every so often a movie comes along that really gets to you. It's emotional, informative, and entertaining at the same time. \\"Schindler's List\\" is the story of Oskar Schindler. A nazi businessman who ends up saving the lives of thousands of Jews during WWII. If you are a movie fan at all, you have probably seen this movie before, if not multiple times. So, I won't re-tell the movie, but if you haven't seen it.....go purchase this DVD right now. <br /> <br />This movie is amazing. It's so brutely honest and engaging that I can't even explain it. I am not Jewish, but I can only imagine how moving this movie would be if I were. It made me laugh, cry, and almost sick during the 3hr. time frame. To see what the Nazi's would do to the Jews during the holocaust was just insane. I couldn't imagine human beings doing that to other human beings, but Spielberg puts it on film for us to see. Like I said, this film is not only entertaining....it's educational. It teaches you how evil the human race can be and I obviously hope nothing like the holocaust ever happens again. <br /> <br />I think this maybe Spielberg's best work. The film looks great, sounds great, and I have already raved about the movie itself. It's shot in black and white, which I think was an excellent choice. I would definately rank this up there with \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" as Spielberg's best two movies. Go get this flick. <br /> <br />Special Features: Not a ton of stuff here, but what is here is really good. There is a documentary (called \\"Voices From The List) about the survivors of the holocaust. It is almost exclusively made-up of interviews with the survivors. Very good and moving stuff. Then there is the \\"Behind The Shoah Foundation with Steven Spielberg\\" featurette. The last feature is featurette about Oskar Schindler. Like I said, not a ton of supplements, but what's here is very good.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I originally purchased this album before the massive success of Thank You and even before Stan hit the airwaves.  It looked like an interesting album, so I snatched it off the shelf.  After the first listen, I fell in love with Dido's music.  Something about her was haunting, mysterious; she doesn't have a spectacular voice like Celine Dion or Whitney Houston.  There's a special quality to her singing; it's very soft and mellow, but full of honesty and a passive strength.  Dido also writes her own material; a talent diminishing quickly these days.  She also plays the recorder extraordinarily well.    The first track and one of my all time favorite Dido tunes is Here With Me.  This song was the theme song for the series Roswell, and with it's haunting muted choral tracks and powerful drum beats, it was the perfect compliment for the show.  The song includes many echoing trance sounds and emotional string arrangements.  I would say that this track is one of the best opening tracks on any album I've ever heard.  It sets the mood very well. (6/5)    Switching gears, the second track Hunter has a totally different style than the previous track.  Somehow, the flow of the album is still smooth, and you fall right into Dido's new jazzy rock number.  Hunter is a perennial favorite among people I know; it's got some great guitar riffs and catchy lyrics.  The chorus is a declaration of independence, in which Dido expresses her want and need to see the world alone again.  The syncopated rock organ toward the end of the track is a nice touch. (5/5)    Continuing on with her rock pop style, the third track Don't Think of Me opens quite suddenly with Dido's vocals.  This is a great post-breakup song, as it has an aggressive nature.  Again, Dido sings with nothing but pure honesty and raw emotion; a trait that is obvious by the time you reach this tune.  The beat is simple but harsh, the guitars and strings are splendid, and she sings with plenty of conviction. (4/5)    Dido takesyet another stylistic turn on the fourth track, titled My Lover's Gone.  She has a real knack for writing lyrics that fit beautifully with the music, and that is one of this song's best qualities.  It's a very sad tune, as evidenced by the title.  Through the first portion of the song, Dido sings with no percussion and very hushed chords.  As the song continues, acoustic guitars and light cymbals join.  Finally, during the conclusion of the tune, reflected drums take over, giving the song a lonely quality. (5/5)    The fifth track and a true gem of this album, is titled All You Want.  At first listen it's nothing more than a simple love song.  However, with a style similar to Thank You and sweet lyrics, it's a memorable song that will have you humming for hours.  Melodic acoustic guitars and lush vocal harmonies make this a tune worth playing a second time.  Dido's vocals really shine in the bridge portion of the song.  The end is rather sad, but there's a great amount of hope to be heard. (5/5)    The most recognizable song of the album, Thank You, is the sixth track.  If you haven't heard this song, you're missing out on an honest side of love portrayed in the sweetest way.  This is the one tune where Dido truly shows off her recorder playing skills, and she captures the emotion beautifully.  A merry piano, easy-going hand drums and acoustic guitars are the most noteworthy instruments.  This is the happiest song of the album, and quickly became Dido's trademark song. (5/5)    A little strange and very much an electornica tune, Honestly OK is the seventh track.  It's much darker than the previous two tracks, and will remind you of My Lover's Gone.  This is a predominantly instrumental song, with warped harmonica sounds and sliding guitars.  As the tune plays, you may find yourself waiting for a surprise turn in the melody, but unfortunately it doesn't happen.  That however, may be what makes this song so delicate and perfect in it's own haunted way. (4/5)      Slide, the eighth track, starts out very much like Honestly OK; then the hand drums join in, giving it a Thank You touch.  The lyrics in this song are fantastic, as Dido sings about encouragement and having strength.  The verses are soft and touching while the chorus is powerful and dramatic.  After the first minute or so, this tune sounds very much like Don't Think of Me. (5/5)    Normally, slower songs without much going on instrumentally don't appeal to me, but somehow track nine, titled Isobel, is flat out gorgeous.  The lyrics compliment the music perfectly, and the constant guitar arpeggios add a mysterious sound to the already melancholy song.  The entire song is sad and full of remorse.  The piano and harmonica toward the end are brilliant. (5/5)    The tenth track I'm No Angel is one of my least favorites, but the concept of the song is strong and the lyrics are well written.  This is the most straightforward easy-going song on the album, with the now familiar format of acoustic guitars, hand drums and light harmonica.  There's nothing in particular about this track that makes it spectacular, but Dido has a way with simplicity; she can make simple beautiful, and that's what she does here. (4/5)    The eleventh and last (official) track of the album is My Life.  This song reminds me of Hunter, only much slower and more subdued.  As the title suggests, it's a song about independence and liberation.  Relatively short, My Life leaves the listener on an unsure note.  Dido has always been laid back and somewhat private about things, and this ending reflects her lifestyle. (4/5)      Fortunately, the last track is a bonus song titled Take My Hand.  Sounding very much like Here With Me, this song has sweeping strings and a beautiful bridge arrangement with building staccato notes.  The strong reverb makes you feel as though you're hearing this in a large church hall.  Had this tune been shorter, it would have been a great radio hit.  It's still (even after her sophomore release) one of her most heartfelt songs, and includes one of the most romantic and artistic ways to say `kiss me' ever: `catch the snow on your tongue, and show me how it tastes'. (6/5)    Although she had a slow start (this album was out for quite some time before it became popular), Dido made her mark with haste once her songs began constantly circulating on the airwaves.  This is one of the finest debut albums out there, even in recent times.  There's something here for everybody, whether you're into jazzy rock, electronica pop or easy listening.  Her voice is enjoyable whether you're driving in the car or relaxing at home.  I highly recommend this album, in addition to her sophomore release, Life For Rent!
0553275976|5.0|Hands down one of the most enteratining novels that I have ever read, and definitely the best rendering of modern New York City in fiction! This paperback was so ubiquitous I waited 10 years to reluctantly read it, and only because it was one of the only books on the shelf where I was staying. Boy, was I rewarded with this compulsively readable, suspenseful, razor-sharp story. For social satire to be so fiendishly plotted is a real treat and this story will have you racing to its inexorable conclusion. Along the way Wolfe manages to poke his pen into virtually every corner of the city, nailing every character-type in this rollicking comedy. WARNING--Never watch the insulting Brian DePalma movie, surely the worst transfer of a novel to film EVER. Read this peerless novel instead. <br />
B0002WYS6S|5.0|<br />I love this DVD concert! Everything about it is so perfect. Well not everything, 3/4 into the dvd the sound quality goes down, but still, the sound at that point does not distract you that much. I will be watching this 3 hour concert over and over and over and over and over...... <br /> <br />I've just bought a half stack marshall amp and about to get a new stratocaster with a floyd rose in a couple of days, and I will be playing along with these guys until my finger bleeds, or when I have to study for my midterms (day before the exam of course! :) ) <br /> <br />For those of you that are not into dream theater, once you watch this dvd you will be hooked to this band.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, they are known for 3 things: <br /> <br />1)Metal <br />2)progressive (continue to innovate their music) <br />3)play as a unit. (where else do you see a full band doing solos at the same time, for everysong???? for 3 hours!!!) <br /> <br />That to me is Dream Theater. And this dvd has what it has to have to represent this band!  <br /> <br />you know how in the mtv hip hop world (bling bling, hoes, etc) they seem to all have alpachino's picture up on their wall or always praising him? well in the rock n roll world, dream theater is it! <br /> <br />as soon as i submit this to amazon, i'll go pop in my DT! :) i'm not playing when i say that DT is addicting! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1400032717|4.0|Excellent, masterful, and assured. The narrator's voice as an autistic teenager is unlike anything you've ever read, funny in his awkwardness one moment and then sobering in his clearheaded  deconstruction of situations. He sets out to discover who killed the neighbor's dog and in the process we begin to learn secrets that will irrevocably affect his life. The simple situation becomes unsettling and disturbing as the facts of this broken family come together at the conclusion. A very rewarding read!

B00005V9IK|4.0|It's too bad the creators/producers did not use the same type of grand scale destruction when they made GODZILLA two years later.  INDEPENDENCE DAY was a culmination of sci-fi movies up to that point taking parts of 1950's classic sci-fi, most notably WAR OF THE WORLDS. Then taking some inspiration from the 1980's television mini-series \\"V\\". Finally, using the modern special effects of STAR WARS. Also, the film used bits of modern conspiracy theories about alien abductions, close encounters, and government UFO cover-ups  (i.e. AREA 51 and ROSWELL) and aspects of modern technology (i.e. computer viruses and cable/satellite television).  The film is therefore, a little derivative in the overall plot of an alien threat from outer space bent on destroying the human race and taking over the Earth. However, what makes the movie work and memorable was the human element of the film with engaging and well-defined characters to care about.  From Will Smith's \\"Capt Steve Hiller\\", Jeff Goldbloom's \\"David Levinson\\", Bill Pullman's believable  \\"U.S. President Whitmore\\", Judd Hirsch's curmudgeon father to Goldboom's David \\"Julius Levinson\\" and finally Randy Quaid's crop dusting pilot \\"Russell Casse\\".  The list goes on as even the small support roles were handled great on the human level.  Lastly, the military and political characters were handled intelligently.  This is a crowd pleaser film and had the film been released after 9/11, it probably would have been more successful because of its sense of pride and patriotism themes.  There are some lapses in terms of resolving the alien threat in a mere few days.  When in terms of real human conflict, it takes months and years to resolve anything.  But, hey! This is Hollywood and it's only a movie...but what a movie!  Great production values, great casting and decent script makes I.D.4 one of the few modern sci-fi movies that would be considered a modern classic on an epic scale. The creators took on something old and made it new again. A film which demands repeat viewings for its overall feel-good aura.n. A film which demands repeat viewings for its overall feel-good aura.
6304259093|1.0|The Crow: City Of Angels is set years after Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) came back to life and avenged his death. Ashe, Vincent Perez (Queen Of The Damned, Swept From The Sea), and his son are brutally murdered by a gang of thugs, Iggy Pop (Coffee and Cigarettes, Dead Man), Thomas Jane (Under Suspicion, The Punisher 04'),the late Thuy Trang (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers), Vincent Castallanos (Anaconda, Mulholland Dr.). After he rises back from his watery grave to avenge his and his son's death. Perez paints his face and puts on a long coat and struts around killing them all off till he gets to the end boss, Richard Brooks (tv's Law and Order, Shocker).  Vincent Perez fails miserably in an annoying, grating and a headache of a performance. Iggy Pop is also wasted in a role not fit for him. Film has the worst dialouge you can imagine, the characters are so unlikable and the action scences never seem to stop. The chase scene with Pop and Perez on motorcycles is neverending. The final battle goes along the lines as well. Doesn't even surpass the first, doesnt even come close at all. Mia Kirshner (Exotica, Not Another Teen Movie) stars as the grown up version of the little skateboarding girl named Sarah from the first one, though she cant even survive this monstrosaty.

B000006O7C|5.0|Sure it's not the Grace cd and we will never know if it could have been but this is still an amazing cd.   <br /> <br />It's absolutely beautiful.  However, this cd didn't blow me away from the start but sometimes the best music needs to be mined a few times to find the treasure.  His voice is still there and sometimes that's all I need.  But there are two or three songs here that match the quality of Grace.  Nothing will be Grace but I will take this over half of the crap churned out weekly now.
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game is easily one of the best books I have ever read. Even for a person like me who dislikes reading, can love this novel from the start. Enders Game has so many unique characters with different personalities. Valentine being kind, Peter being evil, etc. Also, one of the main reasons this book is so fun to read is that it keeps putting readers into the action. Ender plays many \\"games\\" that are full of combat with his other trainees. Ender is almost immediatly put at the top because he is able to win by not using formation, a common flaw of the other teams. These battles are incredibly entertaining to read, as are the actual fights good. Many fights occur like when character hothead Bonzo strikes Ender. My only gripe of this book is the ending. I felt as it was boring and did not finish off this book like it could have. But this is not enough to lower this from a 5 to a 4. In conclusion, Enders Game is what a good science fiction is supposed to be like.
B0000027F3|5.0|HE IS THE PAINKILLER......THIS IS THE PAINKILLER!!!!!!!!  This cd is the heaviest of all of them.  Definately one of my personal favorites.  This cd is filled with adrenaline-fueled beats and Rob Halford's screechingly-brutal vocals.  \\"Painkiller\\" is one hell of a song to start of with.  In matter of fact when I think of Judas Priest, that is the very first song that comes to mind.  I wouldn't go as far to say this is the best cd they have cause think of who we are talking about, the priest has many good discs and tons of great songs.  I would say thought this was their last excellent cd.  Ripper Owens had some big boots to fill and failed miserably.  Rob is a heavy metal icon that no one can replace.  The only one that I thought actually did a pretty good job at Rob's vocals was Ralf Scheepers of Primal Fear.  I would suggest if you never heard of Primal Fear definately check those guys out too.  If you love true heavy metal, then this cd is a no brainer. BUY IT AND CRANK IT LOUD!!!!!!!!!  <br />My fav. tracks= Definately Painkiller and Night Crawler
B0002KQNJU|4.0|Roman Polanski has directed several brilliant films such as Rosmary's Baby (1968), Chinatown (1974), and the Pianist (2002).  When analyzing Polanski's films they are mostly serious, dark, and realistic.  Fearless Vampire Killers on the other hand is a film that balances between the serious and absurd, which gives the film a very dry humor.  This could affect the audience's perception of the film as the humor never brings belly-aching laughter, or even a chuckle. Nevertheless, Polanski flirts with the audience through the atmosphere in which the story takes place as there are serious social restrictions on what to express and what not to express in a timely fashion.<br /><br />The story takes place in the Transylvanian Mountains where Professor Abronsius (Jack MacGowran) has set out with his assistant Alfred (Roman Polanski) to prove that vampires do exist.  Professor Abronsius arrives frozen to a small town and as he thaws in a small local inn he discovers clues that supports his theory of vampires' existence.  However, the locals are noticeably uncooperative to the Professor's questions of vampire activities.<br /><br />The locals almost seem to be ashamed of having a deadly monster crawling in their midst.  It could be that this shame is what keeps them silent in regards to the presence of a bloodsucking monster that wants to feed on their children and family members, along with their inability to deal with the monster themselves.  It appears that the locals want to deal with these issues but seem to be incapable of doing it themselves as two newcomers, Professor Abronsius and Alfred have to do the dirty work of the small town.<br /><br />Polanski playfully directs the film as he teases the audience with a sexy, yet a comically created horror theme.  For example, Alfred falls in love with Sarah (Sharon Tate), the innkeeper's daughter, to whom he displays his inner desires. The sexual tension in the film is exceedingly obvious, yet the people are overtly awkward in the way they handle the sexual issues.  The sexual issues bring a muffled silence to the towns folks much like the silence they keep in the presence of vampire issues.  This supports the notion that the vampires function as a social contraceptive, i.e., vampires existence are socially symbiotic to the family unit as it protects the family through fear and feed on the family blood.  This of course has a symbolic meaning as it reflects the society's different views of sexual issues.<br /><br />The film offers not so much laughter, or horror, but it offers some interesting notions to ponder as the film deals with fear and sexual issues.  The issues are hidden underneath the surface, yet they are thrown at the audience with deliberate intention by Polanski.  In the end the film offers a decent cinematic experience, which will offer some room for amusement and contemplation.<br /><br />A tragic side note that should also be mentioned is that Polanski fell in love with Tate during the production of the film. They got married soon after the film was released. However, their marriage came to a dreadful end when the Manson family murdered Sharon Tate two years after the films release.e sexual issues.

B00005JNEI|1.0|One of the things that really irks me about this country is that people will believe anything if they see it on television or hear it on the radio.  Michael Moore has this country right where he wants it....in his back pocket!!!  Don't give this fool money because all you're doing is helping him to lie to us more than he already is.<br /><br />Thankfully, President Bush won another term, and proved that there might be hope for this country yet!  I was very glad that John Kerry lost his bid for the Presidency because it means that people are starting NOT to believe the CRAP that the Democrats are shoveling!<br /><br />America....PLEASE wake up and smell the B.S.!!!  Don't let somebody tell you what you should be thinking.  THINK FOR YOURSELVES!!!  God bless America, and President Bush!
B00000JXVK|5.0|Please, please, please buy this movie as a gift to yourself.  Once you've seen it you'll probably buy it for many others.  It makes an extremely inexpensive and extremely enjoyable gift for anyone. <br /> <br />My wife is the person least interested in motorcycles in the world.  She absolutely loves this movie, along with my 17-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter.  My 5-year-old twin daughters love it most of all.  They call it the \\"voom-voom-movie\\" because that's the first sound you hear. <br /> <br />Everyone from grandma to motorcyle freaks to babies will love this film. <br /> <br />It is so much more than just a motorcycle movie.  It's about the love of leisurely and competitive motorcycling all around the world.  It's about the only superstar actor ever who was a bona-fide competitive motorcycle racer, Steve McQueen.  It's about $2.00 parts costing tens of thousands of dollars in prizes.  It's about paying for the love of a sport with your life.  It's about the poetry of a group of cyclists going incredible speeds within inches of each other.  It's about taking a ride on the beach or on a horse trail with your buddies. <br /> <br />It has an original and very catchy 70's sound track which you'll never forget. <br /> <br />I give this movie ten stars.  It's the all-time top under-rated film in my opinion.
B0000640S2|5.0|This in my opinion is the best one out of the series, and is one of the best action films ever made. It is most definitely better than the competeing film of 1985 \\"Commando\\", and I think ranks up with \\"Die Hard\\", \\"Total Recall\\", and \\"Lethal Weapon\\" <br /> <br />The movie starts with Rambo serving out his prison sentence he recieved from the pure chaos he caused in \\"First Blood.\\" Trautman arrives and offers him a chance to be pardoned if he agrees to do a mission. Which is recon for POW's still in Vietnam. Keep in mind this is at least 13 years after the US pulled out of Vietnam. Rambo is reluctant at first but agrees.  <br /> <br />Rambo then goes over to Thailand and meets his commanding officer for the mission, Marshall Murdock. Murdock tells him that his mission is to investigate a POW camp to see if there are indeed any POW's there, and he's to confirm their presence by taking pictures. He is not permitted to extract anybody or engage the enemy. Rambo has a hard time accepting this and immediately suspects that Murdock is not all that he seems. All in all he dosen't trust him. <br /> <br />When Rambo is parachuting in he gets caught on the plane, and is barely able to free himself. Murdock and Trautmen believe that it's possibly that Rambo was killed. Murdock suggests that they abort the mission immediately however Trautman insists they go through with it. This adds to the fact that it is possible Murdock has something up his sleave. <br /> <br />Rambo on the other hand did survive the jump. He finds his ground contact, and Vietnamese female freedom fighter, Co Boa. She takes him to the camp, however Rambo decides not to take pictures. Instead he brings back much more hard evidence: one of the POW's.  <br /> <br />After a long chase through the jungle, and being double crossed by the people Co Bao hired to take them down the river Rambo finally arrives at the extraction point. At this point Rambo and the POW are still being chased by Vietamnese soliders. Trautman reports back to Murdock that Rambo does have a POW, and Murdock orders the chopper to pull out before Trautman can pick him up, and Rambo and the POW are captured. <br /> <br />Murdock never wanted to find any POW's. He wanted Rambo to go in and find nobody so that congress would get off his back about finding the men. After being interogated, Rambo manages to escape with the help of Co. Later Co is killed and Rambo goes on a rampage, killing the entire Russian and Vietamnese army, and leaves Murdock for last.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Just one point: why is there no Anya - Mrs on the album? That's one of the best OMWF songs (though admittedly it appeared on Selfless) <br />This is truly an amazing achievement, not just \\"cos they're actors, not singers\\", but because I truly think the lyrics and music are cleverer and just plain better than those in some *real* musicals. Buy it!
B00005V9HH|5.0|How does a disabled, small time con artist Verbal Kent (Kevin Spacey) fit in with a burning ship containing the charred remains of 27 Argentine and Hungarian mobsters ? What chain of events led Mr. Kent and his criminal associates Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fenster (Benicio del Toro) and Hockney (Kevin Pollack) from a police lineup in New York City to that fateful night aboard the ship in San Pedro harbor ? How are the legendary evil mob boss Kaiser Sose and his associate Kobayashi involved ?    These are the questions Customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) tries to unravel as he interviews Verbal, one of only two survivors from the burning ship. But how much of Verbal's story is even true ? Is he really just a slow stupid small time con, or is there more going on with his storytelling than meets the eye ?    The Usual Suspects is one of the great crime dramas of all time, and there's enough action to make it a wild ride. So fasten your seat belt and settle in for Spacey's most epic performance !
B00004U8P9|5.0|Ah, the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an all time classic and saved from obscurity by a huge following of fans who have paid money to see it in thraters dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of times.<br /><br />The songs are ridiculous and the plot borderline retarded, but the characters are so over the top and the sexual energy makes this an unforgetable viewing experience. One word of caution... At least once in your life you need to go to a midnight screening of this movie with a rowdy bunch of veterans. Only then will you truly appreciate Rocky Horror.<br /><br />My favorite character is Magenta. The sexy red-headed maid who is the alien sister of Riff Raff. They work for Dr. Frank-n-Furter, a transexual also from the planet Transexual. Magenta is a megababe and she could take me on a flight to her home planet. But I'd have to get her away from her love interest (her brother) before I could stare at the Transexual moon with her on the beach.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon is very sexy in this movie running around in her bra and panties (Chicken Legs! Chicken Legs! Chicken Legs!). Her sexual energy starts off slow and sims at a low boil until she explodes at the end. She looks awesome in the stageshow finale.<br /><br />And finally who could forget Meatloaf as Eddie. As Frank would say, he's delicious (anyone for another slice?)
B0001NIUWG|3.0|I picked up this DVD as I am a longtime Queen fan. While the overall product was \\"good\\", the first thing I realized is that there was ZERO Queen or Smile music on the disc. Instead, there was a quasi-soundtrack with someone playing riffs (loosely) in the style of Brian May's sound. I'm sure it's because it's an unauthorized bio, and the producers probably would have been sued if they used the official recordings. For anyone who was looking for classic or previously unreleased live concert clips, this is not the disc for you. It is however, an excellent documentary on the pre-Queen days with Tim Staffel and the members of Freddie's band Ibex, and it shows the determination of the members of Queen to become the stars they eventually became.
B0000648WZ|5.0|Ok this movie has it all, the beautiful Denise Richards, alien cockroaches, explosions, guns, gore, nudity, and of course lots of good old fashion fun. I never read the book this movie was based off of, so I enjoyed it immensly without having to make the comparison.<br /><br />Alien bugs from another world attack Earth. It seems they can hurl asteroids at our planet from zillions of light years away. The senior class of a high school joins the Federation (an armed service of sorts which is made up of mostly infantry and pilots) to combat these sinister bugs.<br /><br />When they land on a bug planet all hell breaks loose so sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />I will say though that Dizzy is extremly sexy and hot. It's too bad yoohoo boy didn't get that through his thick skull until it was almost too late. \\"Never pass up a good thing boy\\". Yeah right like my commanding officer needs to tell me I got a hottie hot for me.<br /><br />Good flick.

B000002UAX|5.0|\\"The White Album\\" is easily the most intriguing Beatles album in their catalogue. It's an incredibly diverse set of songs. Basically, a John Lennon solo album + a Paul McCartney solo album with a few Harrisons tossed in for good measure, all mixed up into one double LP.    There's Beach Boys flavored rock (\\"Back in the USSR\\"), bubblegum pop (\\"Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da\\"), spaghetti western/campfire tales (\\"Rocky Racoon\\"), faux hippie blues (\\"Why Don't We Do It In the Road\\"), bouncy orchestral pop (\\"Martha My Dear\\"), folk (\\"Blackbird\\"), simplicity (\\"I Will\\"), drab psychedelia (\\"I'm So Tired\\"), hoe-downs (\\"Don't Pass Me By\\"), brooding guitar epics (\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\") and harpsichord-led social commentary (\\"Piggies\\").    And that's just Disc One. I also didn't mention the dreamy, hypnotic \\"Dear Prudence\\", the part creepy guitar rock/part doo-wop \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\", and the shimmering, haunting, gorgeous \\"Julia\\". All three are among John Lennon's best.     Disc Two is just as diverse. You've got lighthearted rockers (\\"Birthday\\"), acerbic brit-blues (\\"Yer Blues\\"), sublime folk (\\"Mother Nature's Son\\"), eerily beautiful ballads (\\"Long, Long, Long\\"), jazz (\\"Sexy Sadie\\"), deliciously catchy hard rock (\\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide\\"), old timey music hall romps (\\"Honey Pie\\"), proto-metal (\\"Helter Skelter\\"), dark lullabies (\\"Cry Baby Cry\\"), soul-infused rock (\\"Savoy Truffle\\"), and avant-gardge sound collages (the much maligined \\"Revolution #9).     Not all of these songs are masterpieces, but the collective effort certainly is. \\"The White Album\\" is an adventure to listen to, and that's what makes it so fantastic.     Best Songs: While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Happiness is a Warm Gun, Dear Prudence, Mother Nature's Son, Blackbird, Julia, Sexy Sadie, Cry Baby Cry.
B0000VD04M|5.0| ~Movies were his passion. Women were his inspiration. Angora sweaters were his weakness~  <br /> <br />The worlds greatest Director makes a film about the world worst director.

B000002UAR|5.0|\\"Revolver\\" continues the Beatles' progression from pop stars to artists. It's their most consistent album from top to finish, with no filler in sight.     George Harrison's wry \\"Taxman\\" kicks things off, a killer rock song with one of the most memorable (and oft ripped off) bass lines ever.    \\"Elenor Rigby\\" is a major transitional piece. Gone are the carefree guitars and upbeat melodies of past Beatles songs. In their place is a string quartet and somber, heartbreaking lyrics.     \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is a fantastic John Lennon tune. Part pop, part dreary, druggy dirge. And \\"Love You To\\" is George Harrison's first major dive into Eastern music, with guitars and drums being replaced by sitars and tablas.     There's also great ballads (\\"For No One\\", and the elegant \\"Here There and Everywhere\\"), Motown inspired soul (\\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\"), happy pop songs (\\"Good Day Sunshine\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\"), sublime psychedelic pop (\\"She Said, She Said\\"), and lively rockers (\\"Dr. Robert\\", \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\").     The album closes with the amazing \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", easily the most experimental thing The Beatles had done up to this point; an acid-soaked, spiritual soundscape of droning guitars, hypnotic drums, backwards tape loops, and various sound effects. It's groovy, man.     If you're new to The Beatles, \\"Revolver\\" is a great place to start. It's a great balance between the upbeat pop/rock of early Beatles and the artsy, psychedelic pop/rock of their later years. It's also among the greatest albums of all time.    Best of the Best: Tomorrow Never Knows, She Said She Said, Taxman, Love You To, I'm Only Sleeping, Here There and Everywhere.
0790730960|5.0|With the release of Batman, Tim Burton introduced a whole new brand of superhero. His 'Batman' is not only an action and special effects advent, but delves straight into our psyches and appeals to the senses. 'Returns' is a gorgeous adaptation of a shallow plot and masterfully scored by your fave, Danny Elfman. It's simply a trajedy that Keaton, Elfman, and Burton resigned by 'Forever.'  <br /> <br />'Returns' is a gothic epic in which \\"The Penguin,\\" an unloved and disowned child, becomes a sewer-dwelling, villainous politician. And Selina Kyle, an abused and underestimated secretary to the sleeze Max Schreck, seeks revenge and becomes the feline femme fatale we've all all come to adore so much: \\"Catwoman.\\" Not only now, is the audience sympathizing with Bruce Wayne's troubled past, but we now look through the eyes of the so-called villains as well. Good move. <br /> <br />Burton could not have crafted a more energetic, special-effects-laden, and GOTHIC thriller as 'Returns,' although proving only his second, yet final Batman outing--but WHAT a beautiful swan song it is!  <br /> <br />Those that appreciate a more grim approach to the sleek adventure will love 'Returns.' Others (quite a few critics) have heralded it \\"the weakest Batman film yet.\\" No, I think that's Halle Berry's \\"Catwoman\\"'s place. <br /> <br />If you like the haunting melodies of Danny Elfman (with a little help from Siouxie and the Banshees), a star-studded cast, and untouched direction by the legendary Tim Burton, then 'Returns' is just your cup of black coffee--figuratively speaking. <br /> <br />Saw it, loved it, bought it, <br />--GIGI
B00031TXBI|5.0|John Frusciante. What can i say? He is the most talented musician and songwriter on the face of the earth. This man, as many will agree, needs to be recognised as the most powerful songwriting force on the earth today. His music is trully astonishing, pushing the boundaries of mediocre musical thinking, with complex philosophical lyrics which can be applied to very different moods. This album is fantastic and meets or perhaps exceeds the other previous works. I am from the UK and i know that his albums get very little coverage, and i am not certain of what coverage they get in the USA but i know that these albums have to go down as some of the most talented works ever written.   <br /> I know that Josh Klinghoffer works with John on the albums but i am pretty sure that all songs are really the brainchild of John. The albums are raw and other people i have spoken to about the albums and not heard them do not like the description. You need to take yourself out of pop culture thinking - this takes you to another place. I could talk about the effect of John Frusciantes music forever. It has a deep rooted effect on me personally and i want John to continue his huge love for music and writing in the chilis and his solo work. I would love him to tour and do really small and intimate venues where people can marvel at the effect of his music. Although the 6 CD's may burn a hole in your pocket, i would for sure pay this for the genius that is on there. John's music grows and grows when you listen to it. He has a fantastic habit of adding the perfect vocals at the perfect time, with superb emotion that really gets to you. I cannot stop singing Johns lyrics as the songs are so superbly written. I will stop this review now but buy the albums! Keep up the good work John! <br /> James Poultney, Solihull, UK (near Birmingham)
0743243315|1.0|Reading the rave reviews , i bought this book. Writers from Indian subcontinent(India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) has done some brillant writing , about migrant community in Britan.Example of  this writing is  Hanif Khureishi (Black Album, Buddha of Subarbia). While khureishi's Buddha of Suburbia represents the best of this crop,Brick Lane is among the forgettable ones. The pace is slow and characters live unbelivably boring lives. The narratives itself unexciting in most places. I worked my way thorough work and never enjoyed it. The author is no story teller, though she seems to know her characters and their ways well. But who wants to read abt some Bangaldeshi housewife ( or for that matter any housewife) holed up in their boring existence ? (maybe some Westerner who want more of Eastern exotica , but up dated to modern day political correctness.) <br /> <br />At one stage the book peeks into world of South Asian millitant Islam in U.K. Other authors have explored similar terrain ( Khureishi in Black Album,) and they done a zillion times better.  <br />But there are dim flashes of brillance in the books. Sometimes the insights seems authentic and then the characters comes alive, transporting us to their world. <br /> <br />All in all ,rather avoidable book. <br />
B0002TKFGI|4.0|Unlike the case with some of the Mercury Living Presence SACDs (e.g., Firebird/Dorati), where the improvements over their corresponding CDs is VAST, I'm a bit disappointed by the SACD remastering here. The RCA Living Stereo SACDs are not a great improvement over the corresponding \\"Living Stereo\\" CD incarnations, neither in stereo nor in 3 channels. Thus, you needn't bother purchasing the newer versions if you have the former ones. If you have neither version, you can just as well buy the new Hybrid SACDs.  (SACDs compared to CDs using the following equipment: Bel Canto PLayer PL-1 universal player + PRe 6; for front/stereo channels: Bel Canto eVo4G2 amp bridged for stereo + B&W Nautilus 802; for the center channel: Adcom GFA 5503 + B&W HTM2).

B0001XAPX8|3.0|\\"The Human Stain\\" is about two individuals, battered and bruised by life, who try to find meaning and purpose in a May/December romance.  Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Coleman Silk, a college professor who \\"resigns\\" just prior to his retirement after a student unjustly accuses him of making a racist comment in his classroom.  Compounding the tragedy, Coleman also loses his wife to a brain aneurysm, the direct result, Coleman believes, of stress caused by both the accusation and the lack of support he receives from friends, colleagues and university officials concerning the charge.  The irony is that Coleman, unbeknownst to anyone else, is actually a light-skinned black man who has spent his adult life hiding his true identity from the world.  Coleman's life takes a seeming turn for the better when he enters into an affair with Faunia Farley, a 34-year old cleaning woman (Nicole Kidman) who has lost her two children in a fire and who is being stalked by her violent, mentally unstable husband, played by Ed Harris.  The fourth major character is Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise), a reclusive author who becomes a friend and confidante of the ex-professor, and who ends up writing a story about this odd but compelling relationship.<br /><br />\\"The Human Stain\\" is an uneven, often muddled film that still has a great deal to offer the discriminating viewer.  On the negative side, Hopkins is woefully miscast in the lead role, not because he delivers a bad performance (he doesn`t), but because we find it virtually impossible to accept him as an African American passing himself off as white.  This may, indeed, be a case of a bridge too far when it comes to the extent to which we are willing to suspend our disbelief for any story, no matter how worthy its aspirations.  The film also suffers at times from a lack of clear definition, particularly with the Kidman character who remains pretty much an enigma throughout.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing since ambiguity is often more intriguing than clarity, but the filmmakers in this case needed to work a bit harder in developing her character.  Coleman's story is considerably more compelling, particularly in the scenes flashing back to the 1940's, as Coleman as a young man (well played by Wentworth Miller), has to cope with the difficulties of being a racially ambiguous person in a clear-cut, black-and-white world.  Frankly, the movie might have been more interesting had it focused on this aspect of the story and dropped the main plot line altogether.<br /><br />Still, \\"The Human Stain\\" is worth watching, albeit more for what it promises than for what it delivers.  The plotting may not always hold up under scrutiny, but the tone of quiet sadness that permeates the film pulls us into the tale anyway.  Here are two people who have been so mistreated by circumstances that even they don't know what it is they're searching for.  They just know that they can't continue going through life alone with no one to rely on for support.  As a result, we find ourselves drawn to these two people even though we can't always figure out why.  Hopkins (despite the serious credibility problem) and Kidman underplay their roles nicely, highlighting the sadness and vulnerability of their emotionally wounded characters.<br /><br />\\"The Human Stain\\" is a mixed bag of a movie, an admirably original and complex film that never quite brings all its various elements together.  Sinise and Harris` characters seem particularly contrived and tacked on, little more than awkward devices inserted to keep the plot moving along.  Still, in this day and age when most films provide little or no food for thought, even an unsatisfying work like \\"The Human Stain\\" can serve as nutrition for the starved soul.ntriguing than clarity, but the filmmakers in this case needed to work a bit harder in developing her character.

B000089RV6|5.0|Words can't begin to describe the awesome power that is Back in Black, but I'll try anyway.  This Cd is AC/DC's first album to feature current vocalist Brian Johnson, and what better way to welcome and establish a new singer than by releasing one of, if not the best Cd of all time.  Seriously, every song on this album is a classic, and will have you humming along with every listen.  It features the famous rock staples \\"Back in Black\\", \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Hells Bells\\", and \\"Shoot to Thrill\\", as well as the lesser-known but equally powerful songs \\"Let Me Put My Love into You\\", \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\", and the classic rock anthem \\"Rock'N'Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\".  All of the other songs are spectacular as well, and this Cd is the epitome of good, hard rockin' music that everyone can enjoy.  If you don't have this Cd, buy it.  If you do have this Cd, TURN IT UP!!!

John Travolta who <br />still hadn't quite giving a us a great performance up to  <br />\\"Saturday Night Fever\\" is great. <br /> <br />The Special Edition DVD, actually covers the difference between <br />the movie and the book. It also has intriguing retrospective <br />interviews with the cast, and is an absolute treat for fans <br />of the movie. <br /> <br />

Its a book where alot of us girls want to believe the stories guys give us, even tho back in our heads somewhere we already know the answer but don't want to admit it. <br />This book will make you get out of denial from the excuses we hear and to feel good that your not wasting time anymore on someone who really is just not into you! Hope he writes another one...very entertaining as well as truthful..
0671027344|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, and it works to its greatest effect if read in one sitting. The characters are complex, and though some may think this is just another teen melodrama it is so much more. Others believe that it is farfetched, but if it were just a regular story it would be bland and uninteresting. It is an author's choice what to put in a story, and stories are interesting because they are not things that would normally happen, if an author wants to have magic in his story he can, but he puts drugs, sex, and teen issues in and its thought to be clich. The simplicity of the main character is what makes the book good, his innocence and his honesty make it worthwhile and that is what makes this book more than a formulaic story. Books are not supposed to be what normally happens, they are supposed to be captivating, they exploit coincidence to their advantage, and while there may be a level of predictability in this story, it is beautifully strewn together and creates an honest point of view for these situations. This book says in plain English what others do not, or only subtly. It is a wonderful book, I give it a 5 out of 5, and I would recommend it to anyone.

B000022TSW|5.0|This magnificent musical revolves around the fortunes of Terrance and Phillip, the great Canadian TV and movie stars. One Sunday, the little South Park urchins see their movie Asses Of Fire and are completely bowled over. The animation is perfect as it captures the boys' rapt attention in the movie house. The boys are accompanied by a little baby, who mouths all the swear words in the cutest way.<br /><br />The highlight of Asses Of Fire is the great song Uncle F that has everybody singing along to the grand finale of Asses Of Fire, a feast of flatulence. When the urchins start swearing, the mothers and teachers of course pick it up. Soon, the cause of the bad influence is established: Terrance and Philip, and Canada in general. Concern spreads across the USA and soon it's on network news, where they even show a clip of a hip hop version of Terrance And Philip's aforementioned hit song.<br /><br />The school does its best to persuade the children to use decent alternatives instead of swear words, in a lovely singalong number. After that, the kids go see Asses Of Fire again. Emerging from the theatre, the luckless Kenny, inspired by Terrance and Philip, lights a wind and catches fire. He's taken to hospital but after an unsuccessful operation, Kenny succumbs. In the meantime, the mothers are organising, forming the organisation Mothers Against Canada to combat the toilet humour running rampant.<br /><br />Next thing, Terrance and Phillip are arrested during a TV interview. This leads to an angry exchange between the Canadian and US ambassadors at the UN. This is very funny, especially where all the delegates laugh at the Canadian ambassador. The Canadian Airforce responds by bombing the Baldwin residence in Hollywood. In South Park, the people burn Canadian products, including an Alanis CD.<br /><br />While this is going on, Kenny goes to hell where he encounters a sad Satan and an amorous Saddam. The urchins form La Resistance, a resistance movement, and they get the help of the debonair Christo, the Mole. The plan is to rescue Terrance and Philip during the USO Show for the troops. The show itself is hilarious, with appearances by Yippy the Dog, Winona Ryder and Big Gay Al singing Everything Is Super.<br /><br />As T & P are about to be executed, the Canadians attack and mayhem ensue. In this chaos, Saddam and Satan appear, but a wiser and sadder Satan soon returns to hell. All's well that ends well, everybody comes to life again and the movie ends with a spectacular song.<br /><br />There are many subplots too, like the love affair between one of the urchins and Wendy. For a while, it looks like she's falling for the preppie-like Gregory but in the end she returns to her boy, causing him to vomit violently from an attack of the nerves.<br /><br />But the stars of the movie are definitely Terrance and Philip as we see them in their blockbuster movie Asses Of Fire, on their TV show, being interviewed on TV and in the video for their hit song, Uncle F. South Park is one of the funniest, most irreverent movies I've ever seen. It stunned and delighted me.they get the help of the debonair Christo, the Mole.

1400043662|4.0|Kafka on the Shore is at once familiar and unfamiliar to readers of past Murakami stories: in story and in plotting it is reminiscent of past works of Murakami; the Tamura Kafka storyline is in many ways a re-telling of Hard-Boiled Wonderland, and the split narrative style also reminds one of that book.  Indeed, many times throughout the book I found myself thinking that Kafka on the Shore felt like a kind of summation of Murakami's works, all the way from Hear the Wind Sing through After the Quake in terms of style and plot elements.<br /><br />Despite the many familiar elements, there are several significant deviations from the usual formula, starting with the protagonist Tamura Kafka.  Unlike the typical 30-something \\"everyman\\" familiar to readers of Murakami, Kafka on the Shore features the young and proactive Tamura Kafka and to the best of my knowledge is the first of Murakami's novels to be written half in the third person, giving Murakami a bit more freedom in telling this tale from different characters' perspectives.  More important than narrative technique was Murakami's approach to the story: whereas many of Murakami's novels are full of a sense of loneliness and a feeling that the characters are chasing after something which is already beyond their reach, Tamura Kafka is very much in charge of his own destiny as his choice at the climax of the novel indicates.<br /><br />Although Kafka on the Shore started off wonderfully, by the second half of the book, the plot became unusually linear and predictable for a Murakami novel.  The Nakata/Hoshino plotline in particular was cryptic without the scope or wonder of Wind-Up Bird, for example.  Oshima, one of the most interesting characters Murakami has created (and that's saying a lot) is sadly underused in the second half.  Murakami's use of corporate icons and feminist figures is awkward and a bit forced.  In general, what starts off with the potential to be Murakami's masterpiece falls a bit short in the end.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that Kafka on the Shore feels like Murakami is undergoing a shift in style and in substance but it is a little unclear where he is trying to go to.  Unfortunately, his latest novel, After Dark, does not clear up the issue either.  As Murakami has aged, his protagonists have gotten younger (a 15-year old boy in Kafka and a 19-year old woman in After Dark) ... but they often seem like a middle-aged \\"everyman\\" trapped in a young person's body.  It will be enjoyable to see what direction Murakami takes in the future, but compared to his works of the '80s and early '90s, Murakami's recent works have retained his energy ... but lost a bit of the soul that make a Murakami novel an experience greater than the sum of its parts.end. <br /> <br />Part of the problem is that Kafka on the Shore feels like Murakami is undergoing a shift in style and in substance but it is a little unclear where he is trying to go to.

0393035158|5.0|<br />99% of Americans have not thought deeply and honestly about the inherent dangers of faith-based views, particularly monotheism. <br /> <br />Democrats and many on the left refuse to acknowledge the reality that the hate and intolerance of Bush's Christian right base, is a direct product of their faith and the inherent authoritarianism of their world view.  <br /> <br />Harris understands that the values of faith are fundamentally opposed to the Enlightenment values of liberty and free, reasoned thought upon which America was founded and which have motivated the progress of Western society for the last 500 years.  <br /> <br />Many on the left reject this thesis by pointing to liberal Christian sects that do not display the intolerance of the hard right. Harris responds by pointing out that what makes such sects more liberal and tolerant is the fact that they are less religious and less faith based. These sects rely much less on Biblical interpretations and modify their views with secular, evidence-based knowledge. <br /> <br />Harris' thesis about the political dangers of uncritical accomodation of faith-based views have been fully validated by re-election of president Bush. He was elected by the most deeply religious Americans, motivated by fear and hatred of others masked as \\"moral values\\". <br />The authoritarian religious right is winning the culture war. <br />They will continue to win this war until moderates and Democrats learn the lessons in Harris' book, that the war is ultimately a battle between unreasoned faith-based politics and the free, unfettered excercise of human reason and liberty. <br />
B00030590I|4.0|This movie far exceeded my expectations.  It is possibly the most visually stunning movie I have ever seen and, unlike many martial arts films, it has an engaging story.  The character interactions were touching and the film's message was powerful.  I loved that the entire film was in Chinese with English subtitles - it gave a much more authentic ambiance to the film.   <br /> <br />It only lost 1 star for me because of the 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' style wire acrobatics - I just find that style distracting because it is so obviously not real it breaks the spell of the movie.
B000000OPW|4.0|Originally released in 1986, this album would mark the end of the Banshees' days as a traditional four-piece rock band.  Not that there was ever anything traditional about their music; the group continued to mine curious phenomena and weird historical events for its dark themes.  Dressed in a spectacular vintage photo of a tornado, much of the album's content deals with the cruelty (or indifference) of nature, either directly or as an environment.  \\"Cities in Dust,\\" the popular single, was inspired by a trip to Pompeii.  \\"Cannons\\" depicts a town beset by unrelenting heat; in desperate hopes of bringing a respite, cannons are fired into the clouds.  \\"92\\" refers to the fact that more murders are committed at that temperature than at any other.  Alas, it's one of the weaker tracks; while some of the lyrics are inventive, others feel strained.  Also not quite up to par is the album's other single and opening track \\"Candyman.\\"  Somehow a drug song just seems too mundane, or at least too obvious.  \\"This Unrest\\" and \\"Lands End,\\" the closing track of the album proper, are longer songs with tons of atmosphere.    The CD reissue of this album includes the tracks from the singles.  The b-sides are all gems.  \\"An Execution\\" is a horrific account of just that, delivered in chilling spoken word after a tense musical introduction, and followed by an unlikely, gentle piano epilogue.  \\"The Quarterdrawing of the Dog\\" is - perhaps thankfully! - an instrumental.  \\"Lullaby\\" is a dreamlike piece of melancholy and \\"Umbrella\\" a strange poetic fragment backed by typically excellent musical composition.  The disc finishes with the extended version of \\"Cities in Dust\\" (also known as the \\"Extended Eruption Mix\\"), though being simply extended and not much remixed it isn't particularly interesting.  It outstays its welcome, but is nice to have for completeness' sake.    The booklet contains full lyrics, including the bonus tracks, and band photos, though they lack the color tinting that the LPsleeve had.    If you're new to the Banshees' music, this isn't a bad place to start.  It's a wholly accessible collection that still gives a good taste of the kind of subject matter they usually concern themselves with.
B000002UA0|5.0|I have listened to all of Pink Floyd's albums so many times now that I would say it's safe to call myself a floydian.  There are some who would call Roger Waters the great songwriter of Pink Floyd, and with that I agree.  However, to call Syd Barrett any less of a writer is absolute rubbish.  The very first time I heard this album it brought a smile to my face because of the recognizable Floyd sound blended in with an older generation of music influenced by the rock sounds of the early 60s, maybe even to the late 50s.  This album was beautifully composed with artful complexity that can be appreciated by any person of artful taste.  I consider this album to be well worth my money and I would recommend it to anyone interested in expanding their tastes in music, not just to Pink Floyd fans.
B000003TAL|5.0|This is sonic youth's materpiece, But as with all sonic youth albums it will take time to reveal its true genius. The first thing that got me about this album was how it sounded as a whole, it shifts from one mood to another at ease and never really loses the flow. I think that it has to be listened to in one sitting, i think if you pick and mix songs it takes away from the album. Because when you first listen to it you don't get the whole picture, even thought classics such as Teenage riot and Candle stand out form the start but as you begin to listen to it over and over other songs like Hyperstation begin to reveal themselves. For any one thinking of buying this album i'd say buy it today but when you take it home give it time to grow on you, you'll love it.
B00005JN7O|4.0|i went with the highest excitment about this movie...it surely didnt disappoint me...it was more than i bargained for. Jude Law as the quincetenial 30s indiana jones, and Gynneth Paltrow as the ultimate \\"blondie\\" katherine hepburn wanna-be. bickering, judgemental about each other, love-hate relationship...and chemestry to spare. however, just a few scenes and ur just ultimate boyhood dream girl, ANGELINA JOLIE, takes away the sweepstake on this jackpot. amazing, sensual, sexxy as hell...i want more of the relationship with sky captain, i want more of the backstory of her...how she became sky's friend...if only angie was gynneth and cast someone else as franky...the one that really impress me with the nice touch of 30s actioneers was Giovanni Rabisi... over all, was a great movie, and lots of future promise with this director....cant wait to see what he does with \\"princess of mars\\", with this original story base in the 30s, i dont think he will have problems takling real 30s story (princess is made by the guy who did tarzan) and bringing it to the masses with a 21st century FXs touch. <br />this is what real originality means...not crappy movies sorely relying in FX alone.
B0000019PA|5.0|What else can be said about this album that the seemingly endless glowing reviews have not yet said? Not much, really. So I'll work with my opinions and experiences.<br /><br />This album is filled with beautiful folk songs which vary in approach. Everyone who knows this album should be familiar with \\"Holland, 1945\\". It's the lead single from the album. And from what I collected skimming over reviews here, it's practically the universal favorite. It's a great song; the loudest of the album; filled with amplified distorted guitars, and trumpets trying not to be drowned out by the loud guitars and Jeff Magnum's practically screaming vocals, all of which are upbeat. But there are others I personally prefer over it. The title track \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\" is in my opinion a better song. It's about the same length, but instead of the loud amplified sound of \\"Holland, 1945\\" this sound substitutes that approach for a heavy acoustic sound. It has heavy acoustic guitar strumming, soft trumpets, a slight bass and drum beat, and more subtle vocals from Magnum; it even has someone playing the saw. Next I'll come to \\"Oh Comely\\", clocking in at 8:18, and not a marginal second of it regrettable. It's a classic. Every time I listen to it I am crazed from the moment Jeff Magnum begins strumming his guitar to his climatic wailing vocals and trumpets at the end.<br /><br />All of these great, which I lead up to what I perceive as the true brilliance of the album: \\"Two-Headed Boy, Pt. 2\\". I have sat down before doing nothing but listening to this song and have actually been brought to tears (question my masculinity if you dare, I do not care). This song is melancholy at it's spiritually, and holy best. Never before, nor since, in my life has a song tapped into and manipulated my emotions like this song has. To me, that makes this album the ultimate visceral music. It is absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Growing up, my musical tastes have constantly changed. At this very moment I am 21 years old, and I can guarantee to anyone that this album will still be with me when I reach 81 years old (if I'm here that long).ment I am 21 years old, and I can guarantee to anyone that this album will still be with me when I reach 81 years old (if I'm here that long).
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I'm not much of a rock'n'roll fan, so all the quick \\"catchy\\" songs make my head hurt. However, the slow ballads - as sappy as they are - are really quite beautiful. Jet's lead singer has a smooth, throaty voice and it carries very nicely.
0316168815|5.0|Lovely bones was an excellent book. It was a quick read because it gets the reader hooked on the main character. It is easy to relate to for girls in their young teens because it is about a 14 year old girl. When she is murdered, it inrtigues the reader to want to know what happens after her death. The reader then gets engaged by the younger sisters character as she grows up. It is a good story to teach people how to relate to a tradgedy in their home. It helps people to move on, and not stay stuck in the past.
B000002H97|3.0|This album was my introduction to Metallica and for a while I thought it was amazing. Then I bought the four albums that preceeded it and was completely blown away. <br />I'm not going to criticize Metallica for selling out...EVEN THOUGH this commercially strong album followed the incredibly ambitious \\"And Justice For All\\". Disappointing that the band couldn't raise their ambitions even further but what they did produce was a lean, mean, no nonsense version of their past four albums. The sound IS essentially the same, the only difference is that each song is about 4 minutes long and has only one riff. Great if you're after something more immediate but for the Metal purist this offers nothing that previous albums do not.  <br />Still, a very good starting place if you've never heard Metallica before. Just make sure your second purchase is an earlier album (I'd suggest Ride The Lightning) and not the garbage they released after this. <br />
B00005JMAH|5.0|A really beautiful film.  The film scenery was gorgeous and took my breath away; the acting was great and the film did a fairly good job following the plot of the book.<br /><br />It's definitely a more emotional, darker, and deeper film than the first two. It's clear that the actors are now teens; Dan and Rupert's voices are deeper and all of them are taller now.<br /><br />I loved that the Quidditch scene weather was realistic; it was November and this time, the weather is shown as a cold, rainy November day. Dan does a fantastic job capturing Harry's fear of the awful, ugly dementors and Harry's tears at finding out about his godfather and how his parents really died.<br /><br />I liked the way the film showed the seasons changing realistically and the mountain scenery was beautiful in addition to Hogsmeade, esp. during the snowy December when they visited.<br /><br />I liked also the deep scenes where Harry forms a bond with Remus Lupin and Lupin reassures Harry that it's not a sign of \\"weakness\\" that Harry is most affected by the dementors and that Harry faints at the dementors.<br /><br />There's also several foretellings, esp. with the dementors and Harry; in this film, it takes all of Harry's mental and psychological courage to fight the dementors and deal with his fear of them.<br /><br />Of all the acting jobs, Tom Felton did the best job of the young actors in depicting Draco Malfoy's immature bullying and mean-spirited taunting, esp. when Malfoy taunts Harry about his fear of the dementors.  Emma Thompson did the best job of the adult actors; she really portrayed the mysterious, eccentric, and sometimes scary Professor Trelawney to a tee.  It was hard to pick one best, but I'd say those two...Emma and Tom.  All of the actors did a swell job and the film was so true to life.  I saw the film several times and intend to see it many times on DVD because it's so enjoyable.
B00004XONN|3.0|After the incredible OK Computer, Radiohead was elevated so such a status that their next album could have been an hour of them farting into a microphone and some people would still have declared it genius. Maybe they've earned that right, but maybe this album is just a little bit pretentious in places. <br />Some of the music on here is excellent. \\"Everything in it's right Place\\" is a spectacular opening track. Unfortunately the rest of the album is erratic. Most of the electronica-esque tracks are quite boring and bland and WTF is that song with the monkey noises all about? I'm sorry, it's an utter turd! <br />The CD isn't all bad, I'd say about half and half. Even some of the weaker songs show some promise but merely end up being too repetitive.
B00000F2VB|2.0|Way, way too many racist and sexist stereotypes here.  Black males are portrayed as overly aggressive, violent street thugs or controlling, suspicious dads trying to \\"save\\" their sons by taking them away from their mums.  The depiction of black females is no better; they are portrayed as irresponsible, loud, and always having sex and getting pregnant.<br /><br />The depiction of blacks in general is very insulting; it portrays most of them as ignorant, aggressive, hostile to non-blacks, trouble-making, idle, poor, lazy, and loud.<br /><br />The plot of the film is Tre's mum basically giving up and sending him to live with his dad.  It discredits single moms and black females; the message given is that females are too \\"weak\\" to raise sons without the rescue of a man.  Tre's dad then takes over Tre's life and shoves his mom out of the picture as if she were an unimportant footnote in her own son's life.  The sexist message given here is that allegedly, only adult men can solve problems of child raising in a poor area of the city, which of course is an incorrect stereotype.<br /><br />It would have been so much better if Tre had remained with his mom; his mom had been portrayed as strong enough to keep Tre from getting into drugs and crime and if kids of different races could band together and fight crime and drugs.  It also would have been better if maybe there had been school scenes that made it clear that kids of ANY race, white, black, or mixed can get into drugs, crime, and can get pregnant, not just black kids. No kid, whether they are male or female and no matter what race or ethnic background they belong to, is immune to this dead end trap and both male AND female parents, whether they are single or married, are equally capable of guiding their children to steer clear of these common pitfalls.
B000069HKH|5.0|This album was the first Springsteen record i've ever heard  <br />and it's frankly there finest to come. Not only that but a tribute <br />to the victims of September 11th and America. <br /> <br />Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Rock!
B0002ZXCY4|5.0|Sooner or later I had to get to Ayreon<br /><br />Should any of my readers not know who Ayreon is, let me edify you. Ayreon is not a band, not really. Neither is Ambeon. Let me explain. Ayreon and Ambeon are projects, you might say alter egos of brilliant Dutch composer and musician, Arjen Anthony Luccassen.<br /><br />You see, Arjen has borrowed one from the book of the ever successful recording broker, Alan Parsons. He composes a Rock Opera and then like the mice followed the Pied Piper into the river, several well known, at least to me, guest singers and musicians follow our piperish leader, Arjen, into the studio to record, this wonderful music.<br /><br />Now Arjen hasn't used this successful formula once or twice. No he's made eight exciting albums this way, two of which are double albums. Mind you now, I understand there's a waiting list to be in Arjen's next production.<br /><br />I can see why, it must be fun, mingling with other very talented people and making this remarkably interesting and different music. It's probably like, if I may regress to seventies terms, a \\"happening\\". And how different it is!<br /><br />Into the Electric Castle, as do all of Arjen's projects, tells a story and in this case it is a science fiction story centered around eight strangers brought together into a dimension of no space and no time. It seems, if Luccassen ever decides to hang up his guitar he could make a living writing sci-fi.<br /><br />Here is a summary of the story from Ayreon's Website:<br /><br />\\"'Into the Electric Castle' tells the story of 8 stereotypical characters from different periods of time who suddenly find themselves in another dimension. A Highlander, Knight, Egyptian, Indian, Barbarian, Roman, Hippie and Futureman each try to understand where they are and what they are supposed to do. It is then that a voice rings out from the sky to tell them that the dimension they have arrived in is built on dreams and fears. In order to find their way back to their own dimension and time, they must go in search of The Electric Castle. During the search every character is forced to confront his or her innermost fears, and not everyone survives the treacherous journey to the Castle.\\"<br /><br />\\"At the end of the journey those that successfully dealt with their personal demons find out that the voice belongs to an alien named 'Forever of the Stars', a member of an alien race living in a distant galaxy. These aliens created planet Earth and its people as an experiment so they could study, and hopefully one day experience emotions, as they themselves lost feelings eons ago.\\"<br /><br />\\"'Into the Electric Castle' is a double CD. On disc 1 we experience the journey to The Electric Castle and on disc 2 we find out what happens when they arrive there.\\"<br /><br />Haven't I read something by Stephen King like that. Yeah, I know, the plot is pretty ch-e-e-ze ball but honestly the music is fabulous, here are some highlights:<br /><br />\\"Isis and Osiris\\" is an eleven minute multi-part song.<br /><br />\\"Let the Journey Begin\\" is the first part with Highlander and Indian singing in what is an ethereal, almost Moody Blues part. \\"The halls of Isis and Osiris\\" is sung by Roman and Egyptian as the pace picks up nicely with a choppy orchestral beat plus a sitar and guitar solo. \\"Strange Constellations / Reprise\\" the third and forth parts narrated by Highlander (Fish) with an atmospheric background and some remarkable guitar and keyboard work. This is an amazing piece of work that I could use a thousand words describing.<br /><br />\\"The Decision Tree (we're alive)\\" sung by Barbarian and Highland, with all joining in on the chorus's. It is a medium slow very catchy song with lots of organs and synths.<br /><br />\\"Across the Rainbow Bridge\\" sung by Knight, Roman and Hippie. Opens with acoustic then switches back and forth to electric while keyboards in background to a varied pace. At three+ minutes it changes with a chugging beat at a medium fast pace. really great song.<br /><br />\\"the Garden of Emotions\\" is a ten minute multi-part song that opens Disc 2. \\"In the Garden of Emotions\\" sung by Hippie (actually spoken through a distorter of some sort) and Egyptian slowly and atmospheric. \\"Voices in the Sky\\" picks up with a heavy crunchy beat and some very nifty organ / synth work. sung by Barbarian, Roman and Indian. \\"The Agression Factor\\" is sung by Futureman , Knight and Indian and is a mix of the first two parts<br /><br />\\"The Castle Hall\\" sung by Knight and Barbarian, starts out with some very deep heavy guitar work and ominous singing before mellowing out at a medium tempo. Great melody and hooks.<br /><br />\\"The Two Gates\\" sung by Barbarian and Knight, played in a medium heavy beat and pace with some more great hooks and all singers join in and pace changes again. Excellent!(Trying to describe these songs is impossible, every couple minutes everything changes)<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />I have a soft spot in my heart for Ayreon. They, are the catalyst that has propelled me in the musical direction I have chosen. I accidentaly came across them while downloading and was so overwhelmed and intrigued that I wondered what else I could be missing. It turns out, it was quite a bit, so for the last two years I have been relentless in that nothing worthy gets by me.<br /><br />The whole time I was writing this review I had this eerie<br /><br />feeling that our characters, Highlander, Indian , knight etc. were members of that inane TV show, Survivor. Of course in our story the characters die instead of getting voted off. Oh, I didn't tell you? Sorry.<br /><br />Ok, the conclusion. Ayreon is remarkable, and Into the Electric Castle is his most remarkable project. This is Progressive music like no others make. It is bombastic, highly varied (even within each song)and even at 100 minutes it captivates you. I just finished a review on another rock opera, a rather good rock opera I might add but it pales in comparison to this, this is chicken salad while it is chicken sh-i-t.<br /><br />So, if you don't buy this album I'm going to report you to the consumer office of bad judgement for obviously following a path of mundane, mediocrity.ith a chugging beat at a medium fast pace. really great song.  <br /> <br />\\"the Garden of Emotions\\" is a ten minute multi-part song that opens Disc 2. \\"In the Garden of Emotions\\" sung by Hippie (actually spoken through a distorter of some sort) and Egyptian slowly and atmospheric. \\"Voices in the Sky\\" picks up with a heavy crunchy beat and some very nifty organ / synth work. sung by Barbarian, Roman and Indian. \\"The Agression Factor\\" is sung by Futureman , Knight and Indian and is a mix of the first two parts  <br /> <br />\\"The Castle Hall\\" sung by Knight and Barbarian, starts out with some very deep heavy guitar work and ominous singing before mellowing out at a medium tempo.

B00005JN7O|1.0|Some friends and I saw this movie in the theater.  A couple of us had been intrigued by the trailers for the movie but by the end of the movie we were all throughly disgusted with it.  Yes, the film does have some wonderful special effects; most noteably giving the movie the feel of an old 40's pulp sc-fi flick.  However those effects were not able to salvage the movie from the the wretchedly bad acting and total like of chemistry between Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law.  Save your time and money; don't buy this film!

0767903862|5.0|Australia is commonly overlooked. This is a point made exceptionally clear in Bill Bryson's In A Sunburned Country, the definitive underground guide to understanding Australia's history (white and aboriginal), slang (norks = breasts), toxicity (ten of the top ten deadliest snakes are Australian), and everything else. Bryson seems to have an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the land Down Under. Off-hand quips about the Harold Holt (the 1967 Prime Minister who went for a swim in the ocean and never came back) make the book a very enjoyable and very quick read. Accurately conveying the thoughts and feelings of traveling through the vast, vast expanses of Australia is a tough job, but Bryson does a remarkable job. In short, there isn't much to say about In A Sunburned Country, except that it's a fantastically agreeable read. Fit for anyone who's thought twice about any aspect of Australiana and especially for those who may be going there sometime soon.

0790729725|5.0|This is one of the greatest mafia stories of all time (up there with \\"Casino\\", \\"Gotti\\", \\"Donnie Brasco\\", & the \\"Godfather Saga\\" and it's a true story.  From beginning to end you are one the edge of your seat.  Robert DeNiro is Jimmy the Gent Conway, a slightly older character who knows how to make money.  Joe Pesci is Tommy a short fused nutcase who is the pure Italian out of the 3 friends.  Ray Liotta is Henry Hill a half Irish half Italian kid who gets recruited and makes some big money and heists for the mob.  There are a few other main characters as well.  They pull of many jobs, kill many people (some of them were not good moves and lead to big trouble with the mob), and in the end almost everyone they're attached to, and eventually get into cocaine distribution and get busted when one of them Rats on the others and take down the whole organization.  It has tons of action, a great plot and it's fdirected beuatifully, and the screen chemistry of them all is great.  It's full of violence, heists, anfd comedy and a must see gangster tale for all.

B00005JNEI|5.0|To those of you Bush supporters here, it would be most fair and decent of you to log off of your computers and go join the military and die for your facist, war-mongering president. Afterall, you voted for him and you support his policies, so I say show him just how much you support him. When will our fore-fathers' intentions of a seperation between church and state be realized and respected? Read the Bible - Christ was not a war-monger, He was not self-righteous, he was not judgemental. So keep your prayers out of our public schools and your moral values out of our government. And watch this movie, that is, if you do not fear truth, or at the very least subject matter that really makes you think.
B00004STUL|5.0|Will & Martin (Mike & Marcus) get together for one of the finest action adventures up until its time (not to mention very funny).  I remember I was almost 13 when I snuck in the movies to see this and it's been one of my favorites since.  The two are working in the TNT unit in Miami PD when tons (literally) of heroin is stolen form their station one night.  Having only 4 days to recover it and one witness on the loose they must find her and find out who the people are who stole it and how they got the info.  When Mike's (Will Smith's) girlfriend get's killed trying to help it goes personal.  On the verge of solving it they get shut down by IA but they continue the investigation to a very high explosive and good ending.  That's all I'll say you have to watch it to get the full story and satisfaction.  A funny, action packed and Great movie I'd recommend for everyone. <br /> <br />check all my reviews
B000001E18|4.0|Written, recorded and released in the midst of U2's \\"Zoo TV\\"(ACHTUNG BABY) world tour, ZOOROPA manages to enjoy the kind of relationship with its epic predecessor that RATTLE AND HUM tried, but failed, to have with THE JOSHUA TREE. While very much the son of ACHTUNG BABY in many respects, from its title to its liberal incorporation of dance elements and electronica, ZOOROPA shows U2 capable of expanding even upon what is, in my own opinion at least, its most perfect creation.     In general, on ZOOROPA the tracks are longer, the beats denser, the effects more ubiquitous and the passions more filtered than on ACHTUNG BABY. Having examined the world of the nineties from the standpoint of its (mostly destructive) effect on intimate relationships on the previous album, U2 here takes a more abstract approach, mimicking the sound and sensibility of a media-drenched, character-crushing reality in a poker-faced social critique at once hypnotic and chilling.     The title track sets the tone perfectly. A six-and-a-half-minute rumination on the European Union, it opens to a moaning backdrop of sound effects and advertising snippets, struts through a slow and sexy groove for a while and finally erupts into a classic U2 anthem beautifully enhanced by a battery of synthesizers. \\"Numb\\" offers zombie vocals from guitarist the Edge, whose endless list of \\"Don't\\"s works wonders against a soundscape of arcade noises and Bono's squealing counterpoints. \\"Lemon\\" is a delicious dance theme - mostly thanks to Adam Clayton's hip-shaking bass line - which disguises some fairly bleak comments on the material fixations of the contemporary romantic dilettante. \\"Stay(Faraway, So Close!)\\" is a lovely ballad which would almost sound out of place here but for its forlorn, tortured lyrics. \\"The First Time\\" is likewise effecting, a slow and almost whispered ray of hope in the darkness, reminding us that those closest to us shall be our only solace in the end. \\"Dirty Day\\" nicely pastes lines frompoet Charles Bukowski alongside a loping rhythm. Closing things out, the apocalyptic screenplay \\"The Wanderer\\" literally injects America into the proceedings by handing vocal duties to Johnny Cash, a brilliantly bizarre twist with which to end a bizarrely brilliant album.     To be sure, ZOOROPA lacks the end-to-end glow of ACHTUNG BABY - \\"Babyface\\" is fairly forgettable, ditto \\"Some Days Are Better than Others,\\" and \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car\\" does less with its wonderful title than it should - but it more than makes up for its missteps with an admirable experimental verve and the sheer force of its sound. This time out, U2 was definitely more about the music than the message, and the music is dandy indeed.

1878574590|5.0|Frank Miller is the beatles! Being a teenager in the eighties was fairly devoid of revoultionary inspiration, especially in the artistic realms. Then i read the dark knight returns, i can only imagine it was a similar experience for those teenagers in the sixties hearing revolver for the first time. A quantum leap in expectation and experience happened, suddenly a whole new world of possibilites became tangable. Miller's genius is palpable. Someone said \\"talent is making what others find hard to do easy and genius is making what talent finds hard to do easy.\\" Millers writing is effortless in it's dance with the forms, i.e. they are inseperable.  <br />But it is the art work! To put it as best i can it brings tears to my eyes every time and makes my heart open. His love of what he's doing is plainly obvious, he loves these characters and they're beauty is shining through. He is accomplishing what all artists strive for: To capture the soul.  <br />Sin City is a rough place, the collective content of the darker aspects of our humanity boiled up in a steaming stew. And for people who don't want to see they find only violence and the expressions of their own fears. But the human spirit shines brightest in the worst depths, the creative spirit is unstopable, just look at rap music. The politics of the situation doesn't detract from the heroism, Marv is a gritty, Johnny Cash hero.  <br />As Bill Hicks says all it takes is the right bar and the wrong woman, and who knows where we'll land. This book touches spots.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|Let It Be Naked is an awesome remix of The Beatles classic Let It Be album. The goal was to remove Phil Specter's smarmy, overbearing orchestral flourishes and strip the sound down to the basics so you could hear the band's performances in clear detail. It succeeds wonderfully. The LP now sounds crystal clear to the point where you feel you're sitting in the room actually listening to the band live. It's almost like you could reach out & touch them. This is definitely an instance where modern technology has served to drastically improve a classic recording. With Specter's obnoxious sring section removed, the vocals especially jump out. Such clarity! Kudos to the folks behind this project.
B00064ADR0|5.0|Here is my review for the single CD written for Amazon:<br />This work is some of the most progressive sounds ever released by \\"The Winter Brothers\\". When it was first released on Vinyl LP it was a three sided album (side four was blank. The producer had too much music for a single album, but not enough to fill four sides. While trying to decide which songs to drop (to fit on to one LP), they just said, \\"there is nothing that NEEDS to be dropped as each song was outstanding\\". The band was gone from the studio so they couldn't get any more tracks. Ultimately it was decided to release every tune recorded and leave side four blank. I owned the original LP set and I'm glad that they used all of the material. The result was (in my opinion), the very best collaboration ever released by Johnny and Edgar together. You will not be disappointed!!<br /><br />Now about this Legacy addition:<br /><br />You'll get all of the above on disc one here (see above). On this editions disc two...Break out Johnny, Edgar and Johnny's fabled band with Tommy Shannon and Uncle John Turner. This is the tape from Royal Albert Hall recorded LIVE in April 1970. The brother's kick A$$ together on vocals and there is the first EVER recording of Edgars' hit Frankenstein. Not surprising to anyone who knows me, but this (IMHO) is the best version. It includes a long drum solo, Johnny's hot guitar licks and Edgar plays the STANDARD keyboards. For me this is closer to what Edgar's Entrance CD and White Trash sounds...all and all BETTER! Edgar also reprises a great version of his hit, Tobacco Road.<br /><br />This offering is now my favorite Johnny & Edgar's best together. Though this is a bit pricey, I wouldn't sell my copy for anything! It was one of my first added to my I-Pod.<br /><br />Buy it, play it...and I promise if you are a Winter fan....you'll love it too!!!!!

I don't think the movie had very good advertising so maybe that's why it didn't do as well as it should have (much better than the re-make of Dawn of The Dead). I saw the preview of it when I watched Van Helsing on DVD. What really got me was the \\"Mall\\" song from the original Dawn of The Dead. It had humor and gore just like George Romero intended his Dawn of The Dead to have. Of course there's no relation except ofcourse for the people running away from zombies and some of them getting brutally murdered and eaten. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!! The British got it right!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I know I do. This album was recorded a decade after GD hit it big with 'Dookie.' 4 years without an album (and 2 years w/o a single), GD comes back with a Bushwhacking rock opera w/ two 9-minute songs. Sweet, eh? <br /> <br />1. American Idiot - Great single. It sux that Bush got another 4 years. This song will be w/ me until Bush gets out of office. [A+] <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia - Let's just say all 5 parts of this song (Jesus of Suburbia, City of the Damned, I Don't Care, Dearly Beloved, and Tales of Another Broken Home) are great. We'll leave at that. [A+] <br /> <br />3. Holiday - One of the finest songs by GD. [A+++++] <br /> <br />4. Blvd. of Broken Dreams - Good slow-song-w/-powerful-chorus type song. [A+] <br /> <br />5. Are We The Waiting - This song, sorry to say, really sux. [D] <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy - And a great comeback! [A-] <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novacaine - See \\"Blvd. of Broken Dreams.\\" [A+] <br /> <br />8. She's A Rebel - The pop-punk anthem of 2004. [A+] <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl - Not bad, but GD can do better. [B-] <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb - Swwweeet song. [A+] <br /> <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends - Not bad, but the awesome acoustic stuff and then the stuff that sticks out in a sad song, come on. Throw me a bone. [C+] <br /> <br />12. Homecoming - Not as good as JOS, but the other 9-minute 5-piece (Death of St. Jimmy, East 12th St; Nobody Likes You, Rock & Roll Girlfriend, We're Coming Home Again) is great. [A-] <br /> <br />13. Whatsername - A nice finale. [A-] <br /> <br />So there you have it. Green Day has been rockin' since about 1987, and are still going strong. ROCK ON!!
B00003CX5P|1.0|Do you remember when Phantom was nearing its theatrical release date? Do you recall the HYSTERIA in the media with people going berzerk buying up the novelizations, the toys, the soundtracks, just about anything associated with it PRE-RELEASE? It makes you wonder. Did people in Lucas' marketing department have a look at the film, and collectively realize they needed to rush out the merchandise BEFORE the film came out - for if the public saw the complete horror and disaster that Phantom was, THEY WOULD STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ANYTHING RELATED TO THIS CINEMATIC ABORTION! This has to be one of the worst films ever made. Think about it. If this were a first-time film by an unknown, it would be derided for the pap that it is. It would NOT EVEN merit a sequel. It would be a flop. Fans have been HAD with this AWFUL film. Let me say this though: I wept tears when I saw the 2 minute teaser trailer for the first time. Judging from the look and feel of that trailer - which IS included on this dvd - one would say the wait was worth it. It was a glorious preview. UNFORTUNATELY, that trailer is the ONLY thing worth viewing with the re-visiting to Star Wars Land. The acting is horrible. You can only hope that two fine actors, MacGregor and Neeson, will live this down. I believe they can. Everything else in this film feels so hollow, so WRONG. What would have made this an interesting dvd would have been the option to mute out all the dialogue and just have music and sound cues (remember when dvds used to have isolated audio tracks like that?). The visuals of the pod race are impressive, but the stretching of disbelief, even in a sci-fi fantasy, of a tyke flying like an ace, IS asking too much. I won't rehash the multitude of story problems. Other reviews posted here cover them well enough. Suffice to say, the ship - the legacy - of Star Wars began to sink here. Pretend it was never made.
0380789035|4.0|This is a definite bathtub read.  I like Gaiman's style; I get the feeling he doesn't take himself overly seriously, like many of the modern goth-fantasy-sci-fi authors do.  He takes himself seriously enough to write well, but not so seriously that his book lacks entertainment.  The references in American Gods are at times tongue in cheek.  The Old Gods and their various petty rivalries and alliances, and the New Gods, who act as a commentary on our current social state--good fun if you ask me, good dark fun.  It's an involving plot though, admittedly, lots going on.
0395389496|3.0|I remember when my teacher read us this book when I was in second grade. The whole \\"big deal\\" about this book was the artwork. If I remember correctly there were only a couple of sentences on every other page. I have no idea what the story is about, the only thing I remember about this book was the great artwork.
B00029LNHS|4.0|Black Eyed Peas came out strong on this album. I did not know they had any previous albums, but when I heard \\"Elephunk\\" I was a little bit blown away. It was something different than what was out on the market at the time. During the release of this record a lot of \\"hardcore\\" rap was out. Thick bass lines, and heavy beats; ie. Lil John, Ludicris, 50 Cent, etc. It was time for some funky music to drop. And there is still such a thing as the KKK around, however you can't say that someone else political views are completely wrong. There is really no exact \\"right or wrong\\" in politics. It is what the general public agrees on as to those issue. You don't have to agree with them, but your views could be thought of as wrong. Think before you type anything here. (this is to the person a few quotes below). Overall, \\"Elephunk\\" does have some strong language that really is not needed on certain parts of the song, only because cussing makes one look ignorant to a point, but the songs still rock, and give you something to move to.
0316666343|5.0|Like other reviewers, I found that I literally could not put this book down. I read nearly all night to finish it, even though it was at a time when I could ill afford the exhaustion.<br /><br />Sebold very cleverly combines a coming of age story with a ghost story and a murder-mystery and throws in some really smart insight about families for good measure. The result sounds like it could be too much, but is in fact just right. The Lovely Bones is moving and sweet and somehow quite inspiring.<br /><br />There were some little awkward moments towards the end-- a few details that rang untrue, but these are minor points. Overall, the premise is convincing. Sebold creates a vision of the afterlife which works well in the context of the book and is compelling in its own right.<br /><br />The rape and murder at the center of the book could be upsetting for young readers. However, with that small caveat, I would recommend the book to virtually everybody.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Smallville, is a well shown show. <br />with charectars that almost look real and really good. <br />the smallville is the start of super-man, and Launna is who? <br />i know louis, but Launna? <br />how is Lex Luthour, clark's friend? <br />he should be a enemy! <br />this show is exciting, but very...confusing.
B0000029J5|5.0|I'd been meaning to pick this CD up for quite a few years but never really got the chance so I was happy to receive it as a recent birthday gift. I gotta tell you, I'm sorry I waited so long. Keb' Mo' has such a wonderful voice and has a fluidity about his playing that makes me feel like I'm sitting next to him on the stage in some old roadside bar round 2 am with just the true die-hards left to enjoy this stark and soulful music.<br /><br />When the last four cuts of the album come on I find myself singing along with Keb' and I don't care who sees me in my truck. Damn good album.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|No one can sing Ray Charles songs like Ray Charles.  But, Ray Charles can sing their songs and add new dimension so very well. Ray picked the artists and songs and the collaboration is just wonderful...so wish that there would be another volume!
068987474X|4.0|I really liked this book, I read it for entertainment purposes since it's based off of an episode of SATC, but didn't seem to feel any better about what the book was saying.  So, I guess Greg will come yell at me if he finds me...or perhaps, since I'm only 21, the whole prince charming-love-marriage thing isn't that serious to me.  Or maybe I'm a guy...because I feel like I do a lot of the things the guys are supposed to do (like not calling my boyfriend when I am supposed to), but it's not a big deal.  I mean, do you really care if someone calls you on Monday instead of Sunday?  I don't, but Greg sees everything as a sign of his not being into you.  So maybe, I'm not into anyone, and no one is into me, and we all are into not being into each other.  Perhaps I will become wiser with age...fun book though!
B0000508U6|5.0|I did'nt hear most of this until after I had A Rush Of Blood To The Head for a couple of months, and was surprised at the equal quality of Parachutes.  Although I feel that Parachutes is a little slower, that emotional pull was already there in their first album, and I was pleasantly surprised by this.  Coldplay is one of the best bands out there now, and there is really no comparing them to any others, they just have a warmer sound and feel to their music that speaks to me in a more intimate way than some others. Looking forward to more...
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Stephen Sommer's makes another Horror movie. Creatures like the wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstien are in this movie. Before \\"The Mummy\\" films, he had other movies out, but now he wants horror. This movie is a scary movie once in a while. The special effects are okay. But otherwise, it's just a good movie. <br /> <br />Rated: PG-13 For Violence and Scary Stuff. <br /> <br />Running Time: 130 Minutes
B00004XQ83|3.0|I'm a long-time listener of bluegrass, old-country and gospel music since early childhood. I found this soundtrack to be somewhat disappointing and certainly not as \\"outstanding\\" as some of the previous reviewers and critics have said. How it was voted \\"Album of the Year\\", I'll never know. Maybe because I haven't seen the movie. It does contain a few of the great, old-timers singing some of their best music, however the rest of the songs are by bands I've never heard of and they don't quite do justice to the songs as the original artists. Most of the music tends to be geared towards prison, death, dying, and heaven. Because of this, it may certainly fit well with the movie. I'm not sure why \\"I am a Man of Constant Sorry\\" is recorded at 2 separte intervals on the CD, but then, this song is well worth listening to twice. If you're into the movie, you may be into this CD. However, if you haven't seen the movie, I certainly wouldn't rush out to buy this soundtrack. <br />
0425152251|4.0|If you come at this book from the perspective of the a child about the age of Sophie, it is spectacular.  If you instead are expecting a tretise for adults you will be mystified and wholly annoyed.  The point of the book is to present the many thoughts and theories on the existance (or non-existance) of the universe in a creative and inspiring manner in order to spawn imagination on the subject of what is \\"real?\\" Or if you'll pardon the Clintonism: what \\"is\\" means.   <br /> <br />This author manages to make the history of thought interesting.  As someone who merely dabbles in philosophy, I really enjoyed this book.
068987474X|5.0|The only complaint I have about this book is that it didn't exist five years ago.  If it had, my children and I would have been spared three miserable years of living with the biggest jerk in my city, and six months of painful &quot;dating&quot; (if you can call it that) with a seemingly nice guy I met online, who just jerked me around by constantly claiming to be busy at work.  <br />Never again will I allow myself to be insulted by bad treatment from a man!  It may seem bleak to be single at 40 and unwilling to settle for less than I deserve, but being single is far better than the pain my children and I have been through in the last five years.<br />It is a quick read and I went through it in two days.  Now I'm recommending that my 21-year-old daughter read it so hopefully, she won't go through what I have.  I laughed a lot, but admittedly there were times that I got pretty angry remembering how I'd fallen for the same nonsense in my last two relationships.  Never again!  It's just not worth it and I'm worth far more!<br />What I like most of all is that no matter how depressing it sounds at times, what Greg makes absolutely clear is that we are all amazing women who deserve better from men than we've been putting up with, and like Liz says, if every woman read this book and held men to a higher standard, expecting them to &quot;keep true to their word, treat us with respect and shower us with the appropriate amount of love and affection....&quot; there would be an awful lot of better-behaved men in the world.  I think there would also be an awful lot of much happier and emotionally healthier women who feel great about themselves because they weren't allowing any man's behaviour to run down their self-esteem, cause them to doubt themselves, or cause them grief or despair.<br />I'm a beautiful woman, and I'm not wasting the pretty anymore!
B000002I6X|5.0|I had forgotten just how incredible Stephen's guitar work was. This album shows his versatility switching from acoustic to electric with perhaps too much ease for some listeners' to appreciate.
0316666343|5.0|When I read this book, I absolutely fell in love with it. The book starts with a rape and murder when it was very rare to hear such a thing. The rest of the book is about the young girl's heaven and her watching her family grow without her. It was amazing. I literally could not put the book down and finished it in a few hours. It was amazing. Yes, the book is very upseting, but it is so amazing to think about the views of our loved ones once they are gone from this world. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in a book that just can not be put down. It should be read by adults and teens alike. ITS A MUST READ!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am blown away by this series. This is among the best science fiction stories that I have seen committed to film, with some of the best characters creating it. It's one of the rare stories that blends science fiction with realistic characters, and doesn't weight itself down with heavy handed technical jargon or scenarios only the hardcore sci-fi geek in us goes for; I heartily recommend it even to people who are not generally fans of science fiction. <br /> <br />The acting is good enough for a wide-release movie, as are the special effects. The writing is brilliant; the dialog between characters can be everything from hilarious to grave and heavy in the same episodes. There is a noticeable growth of character with each show. <br /> <br />The only problem with this set is that it isn't long enough at 14 shows.... it wouldn't be long enough at 100. There's an empty feeling at the end knowing there aren't more on the way.  <br /> <br />As a life-long Star Wars fan, I think it's worth noting that I am more excited about seeing Serenity next year than Episode 3, and I'd trade that entirely for another year of Firefly. Someone really blew it cancelling this show and failing to get the word out and marketing it.
B00005JM20|5.0|I had been laughing at the movie since the beginning to the very end.It entertained me so much. You dont need to think of anything, just watch and enjoy it! It's very entertaining and enjoyable at the same time.Johnny looks so genuine and stupid.. <br />no poor and dirty humor such as in hollywood movies.
0385504209|4.0|When I went about reading this book, I knew it was FICTION.  However, I knew that some of the things discussed in it were based on true things, or things some people believe.  With those things in mind- I enjoyed the book very much!<br /><br />The basic plot was about Sophie and Robert, two people that fate threw together who were now on the run from the police and on a search for the Holy Grail.  Secrets abound!!  People are not who they seem!  Interesting theory after theory is discussed as these two race across Europe to avoid being not only losing the secret of the Grail and find out it's true meaning- but to avoid being murdered.<br /><br />The book was quite fast paced, with short chapters- which I liked.  I also began to like the characters in the book and began to wonder how it would end- would they find out the secret of the Grail?  With many twists and turns up until the very end, this book kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was worth the read, and it certainly made me think about my religion in a different light.  Again- if you go into reading this book with the mind-set that this is fiction, I think you'll enjoy it as you would any fiction mystery or suspense novel.
B000002NHN|5.0|I discovered her magical voice on a Celtic Christmas album last year and her song \\"Snow\\" is just so beautiful. I had the pleasure of seeing her at Radio City 2 weeks ago and she sounds even better live. This is a wonderful album just as rich as the others. Don't miss out on this special lady. <br /> <br />
B0002YLC24|5.0|...is what this film makes most visits to the cinema seem like. <br /> <br />Maybe it's my age, or the history of my own relationships, but I found this film deeply affecting.  <br /> <br />I'm only a couple of years younger than the characters are supposed to be, and having really felt a connection with them in Sunrise, which I saw only a couple of years after it's cinematic release, I find I feel even closer to them now- this film resonates for me.  <br /> <br />Other reviewers have identified that the central themes in this film are ones we can all relate to, and they are portrayed in such a passionate, real, way, you cannot help but be moved. <br /> <br />When I 1st saw this film at the cinema earlier this year, I emailed all my friends, and told everyone I knew, to see it. I'm passionate about good films, but I've never done that before. <br /> <br />The films appear to be designed to blend from one to the other, the last scenes of Sunrise matching exactly the style of the first scenes of Sunset; so although this film would probably be good without having seen Sunrise, I'd strongly recommend that you catch the first movie before seeing this one.  <br /> <br />And you really must see this one.  <br />
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|C. F. Burton is right. I'm giving it a higher rating than he does because of the quality of performance. The Kronos Quarter indeed does a brilliant job, and the music is full and stirring. However, just as the listener starts really getting into a track, it quits and the next one begins. It's like a series of 33 frustrations.
B0002WYS6S|3.0|I love DT and i think they are some of the greatest musicians on the planet.But this is a bit overkill for me personally,i can tell DT are trying to put out all they can before they start getting older,which kinda frightens me.Do we really need ALL these live releases and DVDs.Hopefully this doesnt burn them out and hopefully they are not doing this because they are planning on throwing in the towel sometime soon.Lets hope not.Great DVD though,just slow down and take a break for a bit guys.
B0000009RX|3.0|Someone once wrote that this album was a parody on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (by the Beatles, for the younger readers who wouldn't really understand -- get it! wink wink), and Zappa  acknowledged that point of fact in later interviews. Officially and with validity (Zappa interview) this qualifies as a Zappa parody, one of many, his bread and butter.  Personnally I like the \\"Shut up and play your guitar\\" collection better than anything else, and I like some of the mid-70's releases.  But We're Only in It for the Money, doesn't really float my boat.  Art wise, it was part of the canon of Zappa, and shouldn't be ignored by the ardent collectors or musicologists out there in search of the meaning of Zappa's life. So have at it.
B00005ATQF|5.0|This film is a real landmark in the story of the American Cinema .<br /><br />The first part is the most powerful of the two . Kubrick focuses his concerns in the arrangement process and brutal training far beyond the duty and the final consequences in the psiquis of a disturbed and weak mind soldier who definitively is put down under an unexhaustive psychological and physical presure.<br /><br />The Second Part is sensitively much weaker and despite it is an original and powerful story , never matchs with the previous chapter .<br /><br />In sum an extraordinary work though Kubrick never reached the anthological level who got in Paths of Glory .
B00007ELEL|4.0|Some might claim the penultimate Noir for our time is David Fincher's Se7en: dark, twisted, a chilling glimpse of the evil in all of us.  Although, to be honest, I'm kind of sick of evil.  And Se7en only drove this home for me.  Evil is gross.  I'd rather not dwell on it for any length of time.  I'm a child of the 80's and 90's, with no attention span and cynical as hell.  I love dark films, but I don't want to sit through two hours of an intense study of the seven deadly sins.  Not really my idea of entertainment. <br /> <br />And then it hit me.  The unlikely Noir for our times.  It has all the requirements: a detective story, conflict of evil and the dubious hero, the femme fatale.  But it's new, fresh, and ultimately enlightening about the way we as citizens of the 21st century confront sin.  It's The Big Lebowski. <br /> <br />What the Coen Brothers have done in their quirky comedy is to turn Noir on its head.  Jeff Bridges as \\"The Dude\\", a lazy, out of work bowling guru, is the stand-in for all of us.  He embodies our Saturday morning selves, the kind of people we wish we could be when we sit at our monotonous desk jobs staring out the window in a daydream. <br /> <br />The evil confronting him is sinister, yet simple.  Identity confusion results in the soiling of The Dude's rug.  His quest is straightforward-after being mixed up in the confusing personal affairs of the Big Lebowski (a self-made success and paraplegic), his daughter Maude (an artist resentful of her father's fortune and the unexpected romance), the trophy wife Bunny (a former porn star who owes money all over town), and Jackie Treehorn (the playboy to whom Bunny is indebted), The Dude simply states, \\"All The Dude ever wanted was his rug back.\\" <br /> <br />Corruption, lies, and sexual scandal confront The Dude and his two sidekicks.  Walter (masterfully played by John Goodman) is a Vietnam veteran living in the past, resentful of all who he sees as opposed to truth, justice, and the American way, and Donnie (played by the odd-ball Steve Buscemi) is the tag-along token friend the other two love and ignore.  And through the eyes of the camera, we suddenly realize that the intensely serious and befuddling dilemmas and situations facing The Dude and his friends are actually an enormous joke.  We laugh at their problems, the difficulties with which they face them, and even the solutions to the disasters they are up against. <br /> <br />And by the end, what is the conclusion we draw?  Our narrator (Sam Elliot), who himself is comically aware of both his presence in the movie and his distinctive position over it, offers us the moral of the story: \\"I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that-The Dude, taking `er easy for all us sinners.\\" <br /> <br />And so, the movie swings full circle.  The Dude, the embodiment of our lazy, cynical, casually indifferent wistful selves, has become our savior.  He is the stand in for our sins, he has the solution, the ultimate answer for our daily confrontation with the evil in our lives.  Every time our rug is miterated on, every time we are mixed up in deception and lies, every time we are abused by those with power and authority over us, we turn to The Big Lebowski for our salvation.  And The Dude is there for all us sinners, because he knows how to handle evil in the world and in ourselves: not with the solutions preached at us for years, not with cunning, sleuthing, or anything classical Noir has to offer, but with a simple and effective answer. <br /> <br />Forget it Dude.  Let's go bowling.
B000001F5F|4.0|U2 became part of the classic rock family and launched into all out stardom after this tour.  Still holds up as one of the best all around live releases.  This song isn't a rebel song, it's Sunday Bloody Sunday !....highly recommended for any fan.
B0000AQS6R|4.0|The poor Griswold family just can't seem to get anything quite right.  Full of family problems and egg nog, I must agree with some of my fellow reviewers that this is the best of the Griswold series.  There are some real laugh out loud moments here.  It's a zany romp through one family's Christmas holiday. <br /> <br />All Clark Griswold wants is to have a good old fashioned Christmas holiday with the family.  What he gets is a tree that's too big for the house, an over crowded house full of both sets of grandparents, an unwelcome cousin and his family, a big dog, a crazy squirrel, a mean old uncle and his forgetful wife, a dead cat, a trashed house, a kidnapped boss, an invasion by a  <br />swat team, and an explosion, just to name a few items.    <br /> <br />Parents beware, there is a small amount of profanity.  There is no nudity or sexual content.  There is some mild violence.  While I didn't rate this one with 5 stars, I still believe that it is worthy of having a place in your Christmas dvd collection. <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br /> <br />
B000001FTQ|5.0|I very rarely give anyone 5 stars, but this gets 5 stars for the live release of \\"Bad\\" from Live Aid.  The live version blows away the studio version and is a must have for any fan.  If you were around in 1985 and witnessed Live Aid, this will bring you right back to the overall excitement of that amazing event which was highlighted by many including a Zep reunion, Clapton, Sabbath reuion, and on top of all that, a version of \\"Bad\\" that measured up to all the classics.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Well, the easiest way to describe this cd is to say that it's like a breath of fresh air. This isn't something I saw coming, I mean I know Incubus evolves and changes with each album, but this is a pretty big step in a new direction few have traveled. Where not many can succeed, Incubus does, and that's why they're definitely not your typical radio or MTV band. Some bands try to recreate the success of a big single, but Incubus builds on what they create, which isn't very usual these days. Brandon Boyd is truely a genius in my humble opinion, he has a flawless voice which he puts on display magnificently, his lyrics are heart felt and simply amazing. Mike, Chris, Dirk, and Jose are at the top of their game once again. They know when to be heavier, and when to be lighter, and they just fit Brandon's voice immaculately. Chris' sound effects aren't as prominent as they are on say S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or Make Yourself, but it's extremely tasteful, one track where he gets to flex his musical talent is on Are You In, which is a great track. Mike's guitar work seems to only get better with each album, he seems to experiment more on this than others, and it works great. Jose's drumming is just as powerful as it was on past releases, and Dirk plays his bass like never before. There's really not a thing about this cd that could be better.<br /><br />A few of the best tracks are Nice To Know You, Just A Phase, Warning, and Under My Umbrella. Incubus stepped it up a notch on this cd, and it couldn't be better. For that reason I reccommend this cd to everybody.
0783232039|5.0|Okay--this is one of my favorite, absolute favorite, movie of all time!  I love it so much that I'm officially 'outing' myself here publicly as someone who totally loves this horror/comedy, a movie that is hilarious, and incredibly gory..but in a good way!  Folks, anything with the Chucky doll in it is probably going to have a huge amount of blood, and add the second doll, and a large amount of dry, sarcastic humor, not to mention a lot of wonderful small references to other horror movies, and you have a winner..  The opening scene that takes place in the police office's evidence room is on of my favorites!  And finally, when you watch the movie, and start to note inconsistencies, please remember, it's a horror movie with 'living' dolls in it who kill people and fall in love.  That requires a HUGE amount of being able to suspend your disbelief, okay?  Just keep saying 'it's only a movie, it's only a movie'..
B000003TAW|5.0|if you own only 1 weezer album this would be the one. personally i like \\"pinkerton\\" slightly better, but \\"blue\\" appeals to a wider audience i think. every song on this record is great, although \\"surf wax america\\" isnt one of my favorites. but i know many fans like it. my personal favorite song is \\"say it ain't so\\". i just cant get enough of it. everytime i hear the intro to this song i smile because i love it so much. and something about Rivers voice just gets to me. its so unique and amazing and i cant get enough. everyone should own a little weez.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|After a month of the original release, It's interesting to give new comentaries about this DVD. First of all, I think Dream Theater did an incredible job. The stage, the lights, the sound, everything is there to give us an unforgettable show. For that reason, for an incredible rate perfection, the wish to have a different setlist came in my mind. Yes, the setlist is very very good. It's almost perfect from the last albums, since Falling into Infinity to Train of Thought. But, it's true something is missing from the old songs. I'm agree to put more news songs we never have seen played on a home video. But it will be so nice, to have the best songs from the three first albums. It wasn't hard, just one song for each album. If you can have &quot;Killing Hand&quot;, &quot;Learning to Live&quot; and &quot;Scarred&quot;, it can be the best Dream Theater song list in one package ever. Honestly, &quot;Pull me under&quot; doesn't have his place on this concert and &quot;Only a matter a time&quot; isn't the most wanted song from &quot;When dream and day unite&quot;. And it will be great to have the &quot;6 degrees&quot; song entirely from start to finish, instead to do it by parts. Anyway, it depends  the preferences of each fans. The concert is so great, it will be difficult to do better.
B00007BK2N|4.0|The film chronicles the rise and fall of Factory Records, an influential record label in the 80s, through the eyes of its prime mover, Tony Wilson. A legendary imprint among new wave fans across the world, Factory Records brought us icons such as Joy Division and subsequently, New Order, and the Happy Mondays.  <br /> <br />The narrative style and kinetic, handheld camerawork captures the anarchic vibe of the era, and director Michael Winterbottom uses a novel device of having Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson address the audience while being part of the story.  Coogan delivers a deadpan, very natural performance, you wouldn't think he is acting.  Andy Serkis was memorable as Martin Hartnett and the actors that played Ian Curtis and Bernard Sumner are exact replicas of the musicians their playing.  I had shivers when I saw Sean Harris (?) as Ian Curtis doing the epileptic like dance Curtis was known for. I thought I was watching the late Joy Division singer live. Truly marvelous.  And if you're familiar with the figures of that era, you can spot them playing other roles in the film (The real Tony Wilson is there as a TV director). <br /> <br />The DVD Extras are also great. The Manchester The Movie feature shows how a decaying industrial city contribute to a vibrant musical culture. About Tony Wilson Feature contributes more insights and things you might miss in the admittedly heady and trippy narrative. Of course, there's also the requisite deleted scenes and commentaries. <br /> <br />The only beef I have against 24 Hour Party People is it is quite inaccessible if you were not into new wave back in the 80s. There are a lot of events that are glossed over and if you're not aware of the timeline, it will just pass you by. Still, 24 Hour Party People is an important work for those who love music, past and present.
B000002J5K|5.0|The soundtrack album to the 1980 movie \\"The Blues Brothers\\" is one of THE greatest soundtrack albums ever made. Like the original musical comedy film that inspired it, the music from beginning to end is a whole ton of fun. The Blues Brothers themselves---Dan Aykroyd & John Belushi as Jake & Elwood Blues---and their ace, eight-man backup band sound positively *smokin'* on such numbers as the cruisin' \\"She Caught The Katy,\\" the rockin' version of \\"Gimme Some Lovin',\\" the infectious \\"Everybody Needs Somebody To Love,\\" the jammin' \\"Sweet Home Chicago,\\" and the old Elvis Presley classic \\"Jailhouse Rock.\\" They also do a hilarious take on \\"The Theme From Rawhide\\" (keep them doggies rollin', Rawhide!), and the band serve up a terrific version of the \\"Peter Gunn Theme\\" that rivals the TV original. And who can say no to the album's all-star guest list: Ray Charles' soulful rave-up \\"Shake A Tail Feather,\\" James Brown masterfully leading the congregation through the gospel classic, \\"The Old Landmark,\\" Aretha Franklin's excellent re-recording of her old hit, \\"Think,\\" and Cab Calloway leading the live audience with his signature big band song, \\"Minnie The Moocher.\\" I've had this CD in my collection for years, and it never fails to get my toes tappin'. \\"The Blues Brothers\\" movie soundtrack is a classic. Put it on, and shake your tail feather!
B000286RNY|5.0|Combining kung fu mysticism with soccer, sprinkled with sight gags and spoofs from popular Hollywood and Hong Kong movies, Shaolin Soccer is a very enjoyable movie. Stephen Chow leads a very funny ensemble cast which includes a deglamorized Zhao Wei.  <br /> <br />Sure, the plot is well within the Bad News Bears/Replacements genre but what makes it unpredictable are the off-the-wall humor and overall tongue-in-cheek treatment of the director.   <br /> <br />If you see this on DVD, buy it. Because one viewing isn't enough to capture all the hilarious scenes like the Face/Off like entry of the team members on the rooftop, the musical number where pedestrians join the action and acts as if nothing happened when it's over, and of course, the game antics of the two rivals. <br /> <br />A big hit here in Asia, this is probably the most underexposed comedy in the US. Whether you're a soccer, kung-fu or comedy fan or not, you'll have a kickin' good time with Shaolin Soccer.
B000005JA8|5.0|To appreciate this album, one perhaps need a bit of guidance. This is NOT easy listening, and if upon hearing it, you don't \\"get\\" it, that's not a reflection of anything lacking in you. It's more a reflection of the limitations in the lack of variety of music that has made it to the commercial sphere via radio and consumables (cd's, tapes, vinyl, etc...) And unfortunately, sitting around with this album, hoping it will suddenly \\"sink in\\" and you will \\"get it\\" is probably like hoping that a closed door will turn into the key that's needed to open it. It's probably more helpful to suggest a host of \\"support\\" listening, OTHER than T.M.R. (Trout Mask Replica) that can help to gently open one's listening ability to be able to digest the subtleties of this album. I recommend listening to some classical Indian instrumental music. The rhythms in that kind of music are sometimes carried by the lead melodic instrument, sometimes carried by the percussion instrument, and sometimes left to the listener to carry it on \\"in their own head (!)\\" Anyone who has heard more than a snippet of T.M.R. knows that there are rarely any hard and fast 1-2-3-4 rhythms flowing through the music. Also, as soon as you identify a rhythmic pattern in one of the songs, it's likely that it's already transitioned into another time signature. Thought you had it? Sorry. Also recommended: Miles Davis' \\"Bitches Brew.\\" This collection of tunes is perhaps a Rosetta stone to decoding many electronically produced albums that were released during that time period and beyond. How will this help you figure out T.M.R.? Again, sitting around with T.M.R. as a key to itself, is probably a lost cause. Get outside of your normal mode of listening and stretch your ears beyond the easily digestible, pre-packaged and pretty tunes that most of us were spoon fed for our entire lives. I can assure you it's worth it, not just for listening to this album, but as a process of learning to appreciate music, as a whole, on different levels. Good luck.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|This is one of the very good thrillers I have seen. I saw it in the cinema 2 times and then decided to buy the DVD. Kutcher's performance is remarkable and the story is original. It is time travelling but not physical like back to the future and Time machine, it is mental time travel.  The movie starts with Kutcher as a kid who blacks out in certain times and his mom takes him to a doctor who advises her that her son should start writing everything he does in a journal.  That would help him control/minimize black outs. The boy starts doing that and the only things he does not record in his journal is his blackouts coz he simply can not remember what happens.  He grows up and stops having blackouts.  When one day he opens one of the journals on a certain page that he blacked out in the middle of as a kid, something wierd happens. He goes back in time with his mind and suddenly he remembers.  Throughout the film he does things in his past, little little things that make huge impacts on his present. So everytime he goes back in time to fix something, the present changes drastically. So throughout the movie he is trying to fix what he has done.  There is only one problem.  Let us assume that the blackout times for him were as follows: when he was 8 then when he was 10 then when he was 12.  If the movie starts by him going back to the most recent blackout there wouldnt have been any problem.  But the movie jumps from one blackout to the other irrespective of their time of occurance. Now, if Kutcher goes back in time for the first time when he was 8, my question is: How come do the hournals stay the SAME everytime his present changes? When you watch the movie you will see it better.  In any case, that does not make the movie bad or anything, it is one of my most favourite movies!
6300273199|5.0|I've seen and heard almost everything AC/DC have ever released! This is raw, alive and hard Rock N Roll at it's very best. An energy on stage that MUST be seen to be believed. If you love AC/DC or simply just love genuine hard rock then this is a must see. Bon & the Boys at their best in a time when the world first stood up & took notice of a band that would go on to rule the world in Rock! Also, this deserves to be released on DVD!!

B000002O51|5.0|Most Boston fans would agree that Scholz takes much too long to put out an album - 8 years on average. However, if it were not for this fact, Boston's Third Stage (released in 1986) would probably not have been the great album that it is. Here's my reasoning: <br /> <br />Tom Scholz's song writing ability was probably depleted by the beginning of the 1980's. Most of the songs on the Third Stage album were conceived of during Tom's \\"period of creativity\\", which spanned the entire decade of the 70's. For example, Amanda was really an old song, first conceived of in late 1978. Likewise, most of the songs from the debut album were written years before their release date as well. <br /> <br />Therefore, although the album was a \\"modern\\" 1986 work of art, it still sounded a lot like the \\"old\\" Boston of the 70's. The only thing that changed at all was the electronic tone of Tom's guitar (still the best sound in electric guitar history). Of course, we'll ignore the fact that the only other original member of the band that was left was Brad Delp. <br /> <br />So, what we have are old songs that took eight years to record. This is a good thing, because once Scholz starting writing material in the mid 1980's, it is clear that he had tapped out his well of musical creativity. <br /> <br />Just look at the Walk On CD (his last gasp) and the latest Corporate America CD (mostly written by other people). <br /> <br />I look at Third Stage as the final sequel to a great Trilogy. Good things seem to come in threes. <br /> <br />It's a shame it had to end there, even though Scholz's \\"Boston\\" is still alive and kicking. <br /> <br />I guess original members like guitarist Barry Goudreau were pretty important after all, eh Tom? <br /> <br />For those who would like to hear an example of the importance of the original members, check out Barry Goudreau's solo album from 1980 \\"Barry Goudreau\\", which features the entire Boston line up, minus Tom Scholz and see if you think Tom was the \\"sole\\" creative force behind Boston. <br /> <br />
B000002J1M|5.0|OK - this album got me at \\"hello\\", which in this case is the first major 7th chord on the Mellotron in \\"Watcher of the Skies\\".  That passage with Phil's high hat figure (heard more clearly on Genesis Live) is just indelible.  \\"Get Em out By Friday\\" is a 21 year old Gabriel at his playful and cheeky best as a lyricist.  But the album really comes down to \\"Supper's Ready\\", the immense multi movement 22 minute magnum opus about Gabriel's then wife Jill being possessed by something (hmm. . .) and the ensing battle for her soul.  I actually found out only the other day that the \\"guards of magog\\" are really mentioned in the book of Revelations as guardians of an evil place, and the gabble ratchets are mythical howling dogs believed to conduits for, would you believe, the angel Gabriel.  It is wonderful stuff and he, Tony Banks and Collins, especially have really fired on all musical cylinders here.  The Apocalypse in 9/8 (if you haven't figured it out, its 1,2,3! 4,5! 6,7,8 9! - brilliant) is still so fresh after 32 years.  Buy it, and listen again, and again.  I did.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Global warming is to this generation what nuclear armageddon was to Generation X. Looming ice ages or swamp worlds or runaway greenhouse effect boiling away oceans are all concerns that touch deep within the hearts and instincts of many young people. Movies such as this have the potential to reach inside and really strike fear. It's too bad that this movie went about it in such a ham-fisted manner. If the producers and screenwriters had injected a bit more scientific reality and a bit less familial heroism and youthful romance then it might have been a genre-shaping production. The best comparison is to the asteroid movies Deep Impact and Armageddon. Where Deep Impact had healthy doses of scientific accuracy coupled with very real political scenarios Armageddon was all action and stunts with production values. It's too bad that the inferior Armageddon made more money because it negatively affects the genre by encouraging studios to produce movies in that vein; c.f., The Day After Tomorrow. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />This movie ended up catering to a very peculiar audience. If you're a huge eco-monger who loves to talk about how modern civilization is destroying the earth then you'll watch this and probably cheer the bad weather on. There are certainly plenty of greedy, capitalist pigs for you to hate. Similarly, if you love watching those kinds of movies where nature is the big enemy in the stripe of Earthquake, Dante's Peak, and--in particular--The Perfect Storm--then you'll find a lot of appeal. It has all the necessary production values, moderately good acting, and people who engage your sympathy such that you really care whether they live or die. In these limited ways, it's a decent enough movie... we just don't believe it is the kind of movie that will end up being watched over and over again in people's DVD libraries.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />If you loved Deep Impact then don't watch this movie. There is no real scientific accuracy here--none whatsoever. Everything is accelerated and Hollywoodized. This is a movie made to scare young, impressionable people just coming out of elementary school and just going in to middle-school--not for adults. If you're looking to inform yourself in dramatic fashion regarding the potential troubles with global warming then you must seek elsewhere no matter what side of the argument you fall upon. For a much more believable treatise on this subject (though just as heavily politicized) check out the novel by Kim Stanley Robinson: Forty Signs of Rain.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
1401201911|2.0|I waited a long time for this book.  I was thrilled to get it via Amazon.  I was *very* disappointed by it, and for many reasons.<br /><br />The first reason is that the premise is too narrow for such a long story to hold one's interest.  A great comic is read breathlessly, and only upon a second or third reading does one clearly identify the boring bits.  Here they are evident from the beginning and only become more so upon re-reading.  A long Elseworld book like \\"Golden Age\\" will warrant a fourth or fifth re-reading.  Not the case with Red Son.<br /><br />The second reason is that it is inconsistent.  Lex and Lois Luthor appear to be in their 20s in 1953 (the year of Stalin's death, at the beginning of the book).  That would make them about 65 when Lex is elected President.  At the time there is no indication that they have any children, and yet a complete lineage of Luthors is created in the final chapter, and a son is shown when there is no intimation that he should exist, or when he came to be.  Also, there is no reason why Richard Nixon should have been elected in 1960, and murdered in 1963, or why John F. Kennedy would be elected President in 1968 and hang around for about 20 years.  His marrying a fat, slutty Marilyn Monroe is fun but farcical.  That is clearly a take on Nixon in \\"The Watchmen\\", where he is still President in 1985.  There is no reason either why a pseudo-Batman should exist in the USSR, as the child of murdered dissidents, since Kal El's arrival in The Ukhraine in the 1930s should have no impact on NKVD activities prior to his adulthood.<br /><br />Finally, the book shows a profound ignorance about Communism.  Stalin is presented as a fairly malevolent old goat, but showing Stalin's son as the head of KGB is ridiculous, given that Stalin never gave a hoot about his own children and actually drove one of them to suicide in a German KZ.  And the drawings aren't so hot, except for the simulated \\"Socialist\\" posters.  A sort of \\"Social Realism\\",a la \\"Batman Year 1\\" would probably have been more suitable.  As it is, it looks cartoony in a cheap sort of way.<br /><br />One doesn't expect deep social criticism from a comic book (although they can provide it on occasion), but \\"Red Son\\", so long in the making, was subject to high expectations, which it hasn't discharged.<br /><br />All in all, an opportunity lost.  A pity.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think that this album was definitely awesome!!!!!!!!  Even people who don't like Britney told me that they like the singles she has put out.  One thing I have to say is that just because you may not like an artist for whatever reason doesn't mean their music isn't great.  You can't judge a persons music on their lifestyle.  And whoever thinks Britney is a tramp or a bad singer is just jealous of her.  This album was just so tight.  It's like the Beyonce cd Dangerously in Love, where you can listen to every single track on the cd.  Britney you go girl!!!!!!!!!!  Keep making great cds!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|I am VERY VERY VERY disapointed with ths version. Added sceans and dialog,and new faces in familier parts. All in all this version is a DRAG!!!! Oh yea Leave Obi-one alone, First he see's his Mentor bite the dust,,Then he becomes teacher to a snoty sqeeley brat who grows up into a pretentious,self serving punk that turn on him, then the poor dude's got to see all his Jedi homeies get slautererd, then the poor dude saccrfices himself for his former patawan's secret love children (Luke by the way lets admit did not even know how to shoot a blaster right on the first Death Star), then this punk (ie; Luke) does not even let him rest in the great here after because he and Yoda kepp conjuring him up in the last 2 films. And now to top that all off we have a case of invasion of the body switchers?  Can't the dude just get a CASKET and RIP??? All in all I would have to say this is Lucas' worst release since oh I don't know...EPISODE 1 maybe!!!  All I can say is that THE FORCE WAS NOT WITH LUCAS WITH THIS RELEASE :( By the way in case you are wondering YES I AM A MAJOR STAR WARS FAN AS I GREW UP WITH THE REAL ORIGINALS. Not this JUNK! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!
B0002SROSQ|5.0|a masterpiece that covers the gamut and leaves you profoundly transformed. I was certainly expecting greatness, but this thing blows me away. To offer so much wonderful music for a reasonable price is brilliant. The beautiful art work and packaging add to the overall value of this buy. Primarily, it's the music that counts; and this magnificent one just took the title (in my list) for best work of 2004 by anyone!

0679879269|3.0|At the end of \\"The Subtle Knife\\", things were dire. Lyra had been kidnapped by her mother Mrs Coulter, whilst Will was left in the company of two angels with the subtle knife (which can create windows between worlds) and the altheiometer (that communicates with the mystery substance known as `Dust'). Refusing to accompany them to Lord Asriel, who is on the verge of war with Heaven itself, Will enlists the angels help in tracking down Lyra, and is soon joined by Iorek Byrnison, the king of the polar bears. Meanwhile, Lyra herself is forced into an enchanted sleep by her mother, whilst the powers of the Church and the Authority close in to end her life and thus the terrible threat she poses against them. When the two children are reunited, they hatch a plan to go right to the end of where the subtle knife can take them; right into death itself.<br /><br />Mary Malone, who has been told that she must \\"play the serpent\\", has reached a world where elephantine creatures wheel along on giant seedpods, and may just have the final key to unravelling the mystery of Dust. Pullman brings out all of his previous creations: witches, Spectres, angels, gyptains, daemons and cliff-ghasts are all here in full force, each with a part to play in one of the most exciting, controversial, imaginative and thought-provoking books in recent history. Yet unlike the previous books, \\"The Golden Compass\\" and \\"The Subtle Knife\\", \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" has a few faults that does not make it quite the awe-inspiring finale I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />Out of all three books, this one is the most blatantly anti-religious; in particular anti-Christian. Now, I have my own religious convictions (though what they are irrelevant to this review), and a critique of faith is hardly going to endanger them. It was easy enough for me to thoroughly enjoy a book without agreeing to its message. After all, religion is a human construct, and I'm sure I'm not the only religious person to recognise atrocities that have occurred by self-righteous fanatics in the name of `religion'. But Pullman takes this one step further and is anti-God. In his literary creation, God was not the creator, but simply the first intelligent being to come into existence. Again, I wasn't that disgruntled: I had to admire the sheer nerve Pullman displays in taking on the concept of God, and anyone who has read \\"Paradise Lost\\" (on which these books are based) know that Satan comes across as an epic hero, whilst God is somewhat of a bore.<br /><br />No, what bothered me about this book was the general attitude held toward all religious people: at all times there is no good that can come from having faith in a deity of any kind, and no chance of a coexistence between those that have faith and those that don't. In my opinion, the key to peace on earth is not religion, nor atheism, but *tolerance*. Pullman displays none of this, and seems to be saying that only way to deal with religious people is with scorn and mockery. Any impressionable young reader will most likely be inspired and enlightened by Pullman's books, but on taking his standpoint, they may also adopt a negative attitude toward anyone that does not conform to atheist beliefs. Just as the stereotype of a Christian is an uptight, Bible-bashing bigot, atheists are steadily coming across as smug, arrogant dictators. Neither is particularly becoming, and the differences between the two extremes aren't really that different. I say again, tolerance is what the world needs, and Pullman shows none of this.<br /><br />As well as this, there are some very basic mistakes, which come across as sloppy writing - something I thought I'd never, ever accuse Pullman of doing. Serafina is practically forgotten, and the plot thread concerning the arrow she prepares for Mrs Coulter comes to an empty conclusion. Huge amounts of time are given to preparing Asriel's army and the forces he controls, and yet we never hear the outcome of this physical battle. Lord Asriel's statement in book 1 about how he plans to destroy Dust now makes no sense, and Pullman is forced to pull a 360 and claim that Asriel was lying. Lyra claims that she overheard the witch-consul Lanselius comments on her role in the witch-prophesy. But in book 1 Pullman specifically states: \\"She must fulfil this destiny in ignorance of what she is doing.\\" If she'd overheard this, then she wouldn't be in ignorance, and the prophecy negates itself. As well as this, Pullman tells us that the prophecy concerning Lyra's betrayal occurs when she leaves Pan behind when she crosses into the land of the dead. Not only do I fail to see how this was a betrayal (she had no choice!), but I thought the betrayal had occurred in book 1 when Lyra led Roger to his death. Because I thought it had already happened, my anticipation hadn't been building up for this `real' betrayal.<br /><br />Then there's the matter of the Gallivespians. Although they are wonderful creations (miniature people with poisonous spurs on their heels) the two that accompany Will and Lyra have no real purpose. The altheiometer insists that they are needed, but on close inspection all they do is convince the harpies of a deal, and get Lyra angry enough to see her Death. In other words, they do squat, at least not enough that justifies their presence, and do nothing that Will and Lyra couldn't do themselves.<br /><br />At the end of the day, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is essential reading, and I don't think any book has stimulated my mind as much as these. Despite some faults in this final book, and an infuriating sense of superiority in the narrator's voice, I have read the trilogy numerous times and enjoy it more each time. Thanks Philip Pullman for an unforgettable, intoxicating, extraordinary read - but I'm still not an atheist..

B0001I561E|4.0|I was pleased with this DVD, as I generally am with any Disney DVD, but I didn't get as excited by the bonus features as some other reviewers.    I thought the bonus features on last year's \\"Lion King\\" DVD were much better, but there were some interesting things on the bonus DVD; there was one particulary good part where they go through the progression of the story, it was intersting to see where they had intended to take the movie originally.     I will say that for anyone who enjoyed this movie or has kids it is easily worth twenty bucks to have it in DVD.      And for those of you who for some reason in this world have enough time to go looking for the newest Clay Aiken or Simpson/Lachey video then this is for you too.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Before Sunset isn't only the underrated and hidden gem of Richard Linklater but also that of 2004. The simple reason is that this has to be one of the best movies of this year.<br /><br />The movie depended very much on Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy and their compelling chemistry is unmistakable. From the time they left the book store till the time they ended in Celine's apartment, it's 90 minutes of witty conversation that covered a wide range of topics from books to environmental issues to politics to love and life. There was never a dull moment because there's so much realism and bittersweetness in the recounting of that fateful night 9 years ago. And it's this night that had caused two long-lost people separated by time and distance to rediscover the love they had always had for each other despite the changes to their lives in those 9 years.<br /><br />Julie Delpy puts up a good job as Celine whose love life had never been smooth but still held deep love for her one night companion 9 years ago from which her memory could never erase. Her display of emotions are spectacular, culminating in the scene where she emulates the late Nina Simone's moves while Ethan Hawke was watching her. Her heartfelt rendition of the original song Waltz for a Night must have been the highlight of the entire movie.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke has displayed much maturity since Sunrise and playes a guy trapped in a loveless marriage whose yearning for Celine is so strong. When he cast his eyes on Celine, it's almost as if he had said so much to her when no words were even spoken. It's that look that transcends time and space.<br /><br />In the end, the movie isn't your typical romantic story but achieves its aim to touch one deep inside and ask oneself if one had ever known love like that. It doesn't matter how long one might have known someone but it's really the power of the being connected to someone wherever the person is that makes the difference.<br /><br />It's about re-living and -capturing that moment that will potentially fulfill an unended desire, knowing that without this person, your life will never be whole. That's what love should really be, perhaps. And yes, all these achieved without any sex.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Not just once. Each viewing yields a different interpretation.lly fulfill an unended desire, knowing that without this person, your life will never be whole. That's what love should really be, perhaps.

0671027387|2.0|This author never met a machine he didn't like. The seemingly endless descriptions of every gadget in this book, and there are many, really get in the way of the action.
1582432678|5.0|One of the most provocative and insightful books I've ever read.  Perhaps you have to be an independent woman to appreciate the introspective nature of this book but I found it gripping, compelling and even profound.  Shriver really captures the nature of the ambivalence of family vs. career, life in suffocating suburbia vs. free-spirited city, the cloying nature of people who believe that spouse + children = pure joy.  The style was jarring at first (a series of letters written but no response received) but it worked well and let me live in Eva's head.  I did not find her \\"whiny\\" or otherwise repulsive; rather, I thought the character was incredibly realistic and compelling.  Highly recommended to anyone who is interested in exploring human nature.
B00005QFHG|4.0|This is an American movie directed by Swedish born director Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules, 1999; Something to Talk About, 1995), set in France with a distinct French flavor.  The cast, headed by the very talented Juliette Binoche as Vianne Rocher, a wandering proprietress of chocolate, is highly accomplished and very much worth watching.  Judi Dench has a substantial role as the cranky Armande, and Johnny Depp makes a belated appearance as Binoche's love interest, Roux, the River Rat.  Alfred Molina plays the small town's semi-fascist Catholic mayor, Comte Paul de Reynaud.  With his slicked-back, straight black hair and the precise black mustache and his imposing countenance, one is somehow reminded of Count Dracula.  Leslie Caron (An American in Paris, 1951; The L-Shaped Room, 1963), now in her seventies, has a small part as the widow Madame Audel.  Carrie Anne-Moss of Matrix fame (but I recall her most memorably in Memento, 2000) plays Armande's strait-laced and estranged daughter.  Noteworthy is the captivating Victoire Thivisol as Anouk Rocher, Vianne's nine-year-old daughter.  Thivisol won the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival in 1996 for her work as a four-year-old (!) in Ponette (1996).  She is surely the youngest actor ever to win such an award.<br /><br />Chocolat is also a kind of modern Dionysian morality tale in reverse with the Catholic church and small town narrow-mindedness as the bad guys.  It gets more than a bit sappy at times, and the unrelenting celebration of outsiders and non-conformists is wearisome and sorely tried my patience throughout.  However, just as is the case with chocolate with its uplifting qualities amidst the lure to overindulgence, the good surely outweighs the bad.  Hallstrom is an ambitious director who is comfortable playing to an adult feminist audience.  He attempts the complex and the unlikely.  Here, there is more than the usual Hollywood seduction of the intended audience.  There is underneath the surface a strong symbolic presence, giving the story a kind of resonating, fairy tale existence.<br /><br />Chocolate of course serves as the Dionysian wine, but it is also a semi-addictive substance from a tropical American plant, the cacao, rich in sumptuous oils and theobromine, a heart and general nervous system stimulant similar to caffeine.  Cocoa was the first stimulant drink to break the unrelenting hold of beer and wine on the European palate.  It was quickly followed by coffee and tea.  Prior to the rise of these cerebral drinks, it was commonplace for Europeans to drink beer for breakfast, and indeed to drink beer and wine throughout the day.  Many believe that caffeine was a handmaiden of the Renaissance, which of course led to the eventual weakening of the hold of the Roman Catholic church.  Vianne, who is the daughter of a central American mother and a European father, represents the shamanism of the New World, leading the populace away from the narrow confines of the medieval mentality with her irresistible confections made with the seed of Theoboma cacao.<br /><br />The problem with the movie, and the reason it did not achieve a more wide-spread acclaim, lay not only with its cloyingly unbalanced feminist viewpoint and its anti-Catholicism, but with the difficulty Binoche (and Hallstrom) had with her complex role.  Her character is a woman who wants desperately to find a place in society and to be accepted by the petite bourgeoisie while maintaining her personal sense of value (and her red shoes!).  She is, in a sense, a gypsy fortune teller (recall the spinning plates) who longs to be a pillar of the community.  She is worldly wise, kind and forgiving, but partly a shopkeeper with a shopkeeper's need to set down roots.  She is also a Mayan princess born to wander with the sly wind that ushers her about.  So, underneath all else, this is a story about finding a home.  Because Vianne is frequently attacked for her lifestyle while being the sort of person who does not return insult with insult, Binoche is reduced in many scenes to a kind of tolerant, slightly superior, patient smile that becomes wearying.  It is only when Johnny Depp appears that we see the real Juliette Binoche and a true indication of her ability.  Incidentally Depp is excellent as a gypsy musician who understands himself and his place as a counter balance to a conservative society.  He is an inspiration to Vianne because he alone is not transparent to her; she only discovers his \\"favorite\\" chocolate by happenstance after two wrong guesses.  Depp also serves to save this film from the near monotony of inadequate males and dissatisfied females.  When he appears I can almost hear the audience sigh.<br /><br />Incidentally, you might want to compare this to Babette's Feast (1987) in which the narrow-minded and in need of liberation are northern Protestants, while the woman with the tempting goodies is an exiled Catholic chef from France.  If Hallstrom had taken a clue from Gabriel Axel, who directed Babette's Feast, and followed a more objective and balanced treatment, Chocolat might have been a great movie.  As it is, it is a very interesting one, and one you're not likely to forget or to feel neutral about.f person who does not return insult with insult, Binoche is reduced in many scenes to a kind of tolerant, slightly superior, patient smile that becomes wearying.

B0000542D2|4.0|Ahhhh...such memories. I first saw this film as a 10-year-old at a northern California drive-in theater. I sat in the front seat, while my older sister giggled in the back seat with her boyfriend. I don't think she caught much of the actual flick.    Anyway, it remains a great movie, but that's not news, as all the reviews here pretty much agree with that viewpoint. Actually though, I didn't like this version much the first time i watched it. I couldn't get past the horrible 5.1 sound. The songs sound  muddy, and the only sound coming out of the rear speakers is a faint but annoying reverby mush. It sounds very sterile and fake. When the songs end the sound reverts to ONLY the center-channel speaker, making it sound like you're watching the movie on a 1964 television with a 6-inch speaker. This might not be bad if you have a great center-channel speaker, but my Yamahas are rather small. Luckily, there is a very easy fix, or at least a semi-fix. Simply switch your sound mode from surround to stereo. For me, this made all the difference in the world. The whole movie sounds much more natural and the big jolt when it goes from dialogue to music is lessened. I wouldn't say it's perfect, just a whole lot better. I'm not sure why the sound is like this, especially when I compared it to the sound coming from the DVD version of The Day The Earth Stood Still. That sounds great, and it was filmed more than a decade before A Hard Day's Night. Go figure...    Once I managed to get over the sound issue I was able to enjoy this movie a lot more. I love the widescreen look and, by the way, this is how the film was meant to be seen. The black and white is gorgeous and very clear, with excellent contrast and just a hint of film grain. Sweet. I have yet to get into the second disc with all the interviews, but I did watch the documentary on the first disc and enjoyed that tremendously. Apparently, it's kind of a preview of what's on the 2nd disc.
B0002ZMITY|4.0|Alot of people were sort of let down with this film. I almost didn't watch this film due to some bad reviews I had read. If there's one thing I've learned over the years it's that most film reviewers don't know what they're talking about. If movie reviewers know so much why don't they make their own films? Be your own judge when it comes to movies. I've seen alot of great films get thrown in the crapper because of bad reviews. <br />Not watching this film would have been a big mistake on my part. Ali G Indahouse was full of laughs from the opening scene. Sure it's not the most intelligent film but it sure as hell ranks up there with the best comedy flicks of the past 10 years. I don't think I've seen a film that made me laugh this hard in a long time. I'm sure the people who hated this film loved the lame American Pie trilogy or the completley unfunny and unorigional Old School.<br />Even the deleted scenes in this film are hilarious. There's one deleted scene that made me cry laughing. It was a parody of west side story involving a booger fight.<br />Take it from me (a comedy writer), Ali G Indahouse is a funny movie worth watching. If you don't get at least one or two good laughs out of this film e-mail me and tell me what a moron I am.
B00003CXRP|3.0|Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt are very good. If this movie had eliminated some of the commercialism and either stranded both of them or just Hanks without a previous relationship with Hunt it would have been better I think. As it is FedEx was overly thrown in our face and it leaves a bad taste in our mouth when Hunt and Hanks don't get back together at the end of the movie. So along with being stranded on an island for years, poor Hanks has no assurances about his life or a relationship in the end. If you like depressing endings this may appeal to you. There is only a faint hint of a possible chance at a relationship with the sculptor that drew the wings on a package he found on the island. I regret I don't feel like viewing it again like I do towards other castaway movies. This would have been a great movie for Hanks if they had just shown a little part of him working for FedEx, then stranded him on the island after the plane crash. Then use some interesting things on the island perhaps even a native like in Robinson Crusoe, and definitely skip the bit with the volleyball. Look how well the series \\"Lost\\" is doing because of the great acting and the suspense of what is on the island. I have all of Tom Hanks movies except this one. I recommend this one as a rental before you buy it.
B00005OWEG|4.0|This movie complements Michael Cimino's Deer Hunter.  Both of them were made around the same time, using the war theme to question the futility of war and analysing what warfare has done to anyone of us -both physically & mentally.  Whilst Deer Hunter tackles the anti-war theme on a more personal level, Francis Ford Coppola uses a more metaphorical & more abstract way in conveying his vision.  This redux version is a whopping three hours and eight minutes long.  It started with a bang and ended with a whisper.  Kurtz (the person that was ordered to be terminted with extreme prejudice) invited death as Nick did so in the Deer Hunter (played tragically by Christopher Walken).  The insanities and the illogical of any wars were portrayed brilliantly by Duvall (as Duke who would order his entourage to play Wagner's \\"Flight of the Valkyries\\" prior to them completely blowing the Vietnamese village into smithereen whilst having the jest to discuss in-depth & sourcing for a beach to do a perfect surfing literally, the fling with the Playboy bunnies literally, the boat-crew's dinner with the French family right in the middle of nowhere to protect what's left of their rubber plantation, & the final appointment with their destiny with Kurtz in an \\"Utopia\\" that is neither heaven nor hell.  The movie was rather surreal to sit through & some of the dream-like stance was rather mesmering & hypnotical.  Again, this is something of what I consider a modern classic & it definitely withstands the test of time well.  Whilst the Vietnam war is over, the theme of fighting a war without a cause and thus, an emergence of a lost soldiers is contemporary as what's happening now in Iraq.  Perhaps, the soldiers might be going home but that doesn't mean that their hearts would be doing the same.  Rather, they have leapt into darkness that would never again see the light of day.  A performance of an epic proportion by Marlon Brando (an hour or less in total), Martin Sheen (looked rather like Emilio Estevez), Dennis Hopper, and the list continues.  An experience not to be missed.  This DVD comes with extras such as talking us through the re-editing, the rehearsal that the patrol boat crew went through prior to actual shooting in the Philippines, Francis Ford Coppola's account of the much talked about alternate ending(?).  Highly recommended
B00000JLWW|1.0|This movie is so sick.  They rate it PG13 and theres so much dirty content in it.  This director should have stayed with aliens.  Oh well.
B000002JR8|5.0|the is the greatest metal album of all time. pantera is the greatest band of all time. i dont care what you say you cannot deny that dimebag is one of the best guitar players of our time. his riffs and so hard core and his solos blaze but they have soul unlike most metal players. vinnie has got to be the best drummer of our time as well his drum kit sounds like a mac truck hitting you in the face. find me someone out there you could play half of his beats and ill bow down to you.phil is pissed off and allways hard core. i have never seen a band play so hard everytime they rock the house. the songs on this album and great from start to stop. goin from head banging mosh pitting to mellow plant caravan. you must have this album if you like metal.
B0000931OG|4.0|The first time I heard this album I absolutely hated it because of the lack of guitar, the absence of Graham Coxon. He had always been my favourite member of the band and since he left, I'd been pissed at every song that blur has produced since then. <br /> <br />But the more I listened to this album, the more I enjoyed it. I suppose you could label this the oddball album because blur almost sounds like a different band. Albarn seems to fall back a lot on exotic rhythms, perhaps something he's become obsessed with as a result of all his traveling and Mali music. The tunes are generally slower than the average blur song, especially with tracks like Out of Time and Good Song, but it's some of the most touching music I've heard in a while.  <br /> <br />Albeit some of the faster hits like Crazy Beat and the  thrashy, Coxon-esque We've Got A File On You, the band sounds unique, relaxed, at ease, and very experimental. Albarn's voice is good as ever though at some points he sounds like he's worn out and completely tired of living. One cannot blame him for this. Blur's been around for ten years and they've learned a lot from experience. Graham Coxon does appear on one song, the fittingly named autobiographic closing track: Battery In Your Leg. If ever Albarn sounded like he was going to collapse from exhaustion, this would be it. I shan't spoil the surprise for you, but the song is so beautiful I nearly cried the first time I heard it. <br /> <br />All in all, it's a very good album considering they'd already released a Best Of (which often in music is like selling your soul - and music making ability - to the devil in exchange for fame and immortality). Blur's still truckin, though perhaps now at a different pace and mindset than they were before.
0793518326|4.0|This book is undoubtably the best Beatles songbook ever written. The transcriptions are usually dead-on and the voicing is replicated exactly. However, for the Beatles purist (such as myself) there are a few instances of miscalculation. For example, in \\"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\\" the second verse (the one in which the wood blocks are used), George Harrison (yes -- Harrison) laid down an exceptionally brillant bass line, different from that heard in the first verse, but the repeat does not show that, and the new bass line is not transcribed. It is because of nuiances like these scattered throughout the book that could fustrate the avid Beatles fan/musician, but this book still stands as the most faithful reproduction of their music on paper to date. The music is all HAND-WRITTEN, and was transcribed by only 4 people. Plus, the sheer volume of Beatles music (the entire catalouge) should be reason enough for any Beatles fan/musician to purcase this book first thing in the morning. It is the only Beatles music book you should need (guitar lines are even laid out in Tablature form), except if you are looking to perform more solo-acoustic renditions of certain songs, in which case I recomend the Bealtes Acoustic Songbook.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Hollywood did it again.  This movie could have been so much better.  \\"Based on The Illiad\\" simply means that they used the same names as some of the characters and locations. When is Hollywood going to realize that saying \\"based on\\" does not grant a blanket license to rewrite the entire story?  The Illiad stands on it's own merits as a masterpiece.  Why obliterate it?  I'm not talking \\"time constraint\\" editing here folks.  The story was mutilated.<br /><br />As much as I like Brad Pitt in other movies, this definitely was a poor choice for Achilles.  His dialog is not convincing at all.  As a matter of fact, this very element ruined the movie for me. In contrast, Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana and Sean Bean were wonderful.<br /><br />The effects, cinematography and choreography were adequately done in my opinion.  More \\"fluff\\" in nature but not distracting.  I didn't notice the length of the movie as a problem.  As negative as my review sounds, I honestly believe that there will be a few people that like it for atleast one viewing.  \\"Renting\\" is a fair recommendation.

Quincy Jones did that!!!!!  now when i get mad at people i play this clip and they know im mad as hell... <br /> <br />overall this sdtk, the movie, and everything is just estounding and by far this is the best movie i have ever seen....EVER!!!! i have never seen a movie and heard a soundtrack that changed my life... <br /> <br />5+++++++++ stars
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore did an excellent job of researching and digging to find all of Bush's, along with many other politician's and corporate scum's, lies and secrets. I knew bits and pieces but this movie cleared all gaps for me. I think that it should be mandatory for every American, young and old, to watch this movie and learn what their president truly is. Even if all American's did watch this movie, it takes an open minded individual to truly grasp what Moore is saying. My husband, much of his family, and our friends were Bush supporters until they watched this movie. Moore presents his info in a clear and precise manner, giving interviews and documents as proof of his research results. IT IS A MUST SEE!!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|When I first heard of this movie, I originally dismissed it as trash. However, reliable sources later on told me it was good, so I gave it more thought. Now, months later, I just recently finished Scarface and I must say WOW! I have made a lot of mistakes in my life concerning good movies. I delayed watching Batman, Evil Dead, Fight Club, American History X, and etc. Sure, I've seen my share of good and great movies, but rarely do I come across one where the script and character fits so perfectly. <br /> <br />I can honestly say I have never seen a movie where the gangster image fits so well. Al Pacino come in as Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant with a thick accent, unbelievable courage, and a ruthless personality. However, while it was his personality that helped him become powerful, it was also ironically the cause of his downfall. <br /> <br />His ruthlessness allowed him kill someone who betrays him. An act which eventually led to his massive success since there was no one else willing to impede him. However, he is ruthless to everyone, EXCEPT certain kinds of people. This will eventually be his downfall. <br /> <br />Personally, I thought the flow of the movie was excellent. Seeing Montana go from a quick witted, straight thinking sly criminal with everything going his way to the cocaine addicted, paranoid crime lord with everything falling apart around him was exhilarating. Personally, I thought there was certain plot holes that were never addressed, but they were rather small. <br /> <br />The music was great, in my opinion. I am a fan of this kind of music, though, and playing those GTA games may have allow me to embraced this music much easier. When the first club scene came on and the music blared out, I was blown away. I loved it! Every music piece after that was still excellent. The only bad part about the music was the first time Tony saw his sister, whom he is overprotective of, with another guy who was getting comfy with her. The music became omnious,which didn't really seem to fit it. It should have kept the regular flow and let Montana's eyes do all the work. His eyes were perfect! It didn't reveal any animosity, yet it did reveal that something was wrong. <br /> <br />The final part of this movie I would like to comment on is the script! WOW! Incredible! I have never seen a movie with so many great quotes! Of course, I haven't seen the Godfather series nor even the acclaimed Casablanca, but still, wow! The best one was probably the \\"bad guy\\" speech. Hell, it was so good, that the rapper Fabolous even made a song including it! Al Pacino truly mastered the art of speech! <br /> <br />This movie is truly excellent. My only regret is that I have took so long to see it. I implore all of you out there who haven't seen it yet to do so as quickly as possible. Buy it, rent it, borrow it, whatever! Just see it!
0385510438|5.0|Prior to this book I had not been thrilled with anything by Grisham in a while.  Not only do I love this book compared to his others but it is on my favorite books of all time list.  I think it's fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed every page.  Like several others have said it's not really a mystery per se although a murder does take place.   I highly recommend anyone who hasn't gotten around to reading it do so asap.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I first like to say that this movie is NOT a comedy.  Who ever decided to market this movie as a comedy undoubtedly never actually watched the movie.  Yes there are amusing parts, but this movie is far from Ace Ventura.  I did not like Jim Carey's Ace Ventura...I really liked this movie.     If you were ever in a relationship that just couldn't work out, no matter how much love was there, you need to see this movie.  Remarkably written from a man's point of view about relationships, this film still manages to touch the heart of the fairer sex.  Any bad reviews under this movie were undoubtedly written by individuals who have never been in both love and turmoil at the same time and happily or sadly (depends how you look at it)just do not identify.      Kate Winslet's performance is awe inspiring...and this is  unmistakably one of Jim Carey's best dramatic performance to date.  WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!
068987474X|2.0|I read this book cover to cover, and have read some of the reviews on amazon.com.  After reading it, I had mixed feelings.  My primary motivation  for reading it had to do with the subtitle, \\"No Excuses-Truth....\\"  My subsequent ambition was to see what kinds of men the women were dating (who wrote in to Greg) that led them to feel this way.  Fascinatingly, at the end of each chapter, highlighted in black, are \\"unscientific polls\\" of men who were questioned about the material mentioned in that chapter.  Nifty, but again, unscientific.  I do not recall reading any footnoted economic demographic per survey illustrating any income bracket of the polled men.  Based on extensive conversations I have had with female friends, I have surmised that money and a man's capability of establishing and maintaining financial support for both he and his significant other plays a prominent role in any relationship.  As a close female friend of mine maintained, \\"Women are attracted to income.\\" (Without the money, you ain't got no honey!) <br /> <br />This book did offer some valid observations (i.e.: if a man wants to take things slowly in a relationship, he will let you know immediately--myself, case in point.)  I also agreed that a \\"bad boy\\" meant a man with low-self esteem.  The more I read the book, my reaction oscillated between 1)surprise at the content of the women's letters and wondering what had happened to these women in their past to make them believe that the relationships they were communicating about were sincere, let alone salvagable, and 2)shock at the embryonic level of Greg's advice and comments, making me wonder whether his own relationship skills had never matured past and infancy stage and had to be breast-fed by his current wife, or if he was much \\"the player\\" as he had claimed to be in the book, and his new found wisdom harbored with it the equivalent revelatory punch of someone who is\\"born-again,\\" in which case this book is proselytizing and Greg is simply preaching to the choir.   <br /> <br />The reactions of the women I know who were at the very least aware of the book ran the gamut.  They ranged from annoyance at the book's existence and finding it totally unnecessary, to proclaiming it \\"common sense.\\"  Labeling the material \\"common sense\\" is valid, but why spend money on common sense?  I suppose in the long run it is cheaper than therapy, so more power to that school-of-thought. <br /> <br />A few customers I came across at the bookstore were wondering if this book is comparable to \\"The Rules\\" books.  Not really, I've told them.  This book tends to offer \\"handy advice\\" while \\"The Rules\\" seemed almost militant about its plan for dating and marriage.  \\"The Rules\\" was also co-written by a woman who eventually divorced and this was co-authored by a \\"former 'player' \\" who worked as a consultant for a comedy on HBO.  Both are equally telling. <br /> <br />This book also mentions that there are more good women out there than good men, which is arrogant presumption.  A person's heart cannot be measured by an MMPI, let alone a poll.  Then again, a person's heart has unfortunately become used as a ruse to get to what \\"dating\\" has just become a euphemism for: nookie.  And all too many women's magazines are inundated with articles and questionnaires whose guage of a relationship is about as deep as the foundation a woman spackles on to her face before the real coverup (read, mascara) begins.  Same with \\"He's Just Not That Into You.\\"   <br /> <br />What I am hoping is that there are enough mature women around to see right through this book and realize with enough of their own sense that if he acts as if you're not for him, that you'll realize it for yourself and not need this mediocre book to realize it for you.
0385486804|5.0|The story of Christopher is interesting enough, and blah blah blah . . .<br /><br />I read this novel months ago:  when reading it, I remember thinking how the author's digressions about his ailing father and about how he climbed the Devil's Thumb (etc.) were irritating, unwelcome intrusions.<br /><br />Now that time has shed some light on the matter, however, I would have to say that those are the passages I remember the most:  so haunting, well-written, and painful were they, that they are, to my surprise, chiefly all I remember, or at least remember fondly, about the book.<br /><br />Glad I didn't write this review after just having finished the thing.

B000035P5E|4.0|<br />A great many people have already pointed out why Eye of the Needle is such a fantantic thriller. I wholeheartedly agree and will therefore not repeat what has alreadly been stated before. I only would like to add that there exist two versions of this film - or more precisley to different endings of the same film. I don't know about USA, but the version shown on television in Europe has Ian Bannion tranported to the remote island by helicopter. The current DVD-version does not feature the aforementioned helicopter sequence. My question for Amazon and MGM is, would it be possible to include the alternate ending in a future DVD-edition of this first class nail biter?  <br /> <br /> <br />Kind, Chris

Oh yeah and Watty when you gonna learn that all rock these days is repeated loops lyrics about skateboardin or gothic crap with suckey beats. Im done peace out white people\\" <br /> <br />I agree with all the points above. Em is whack, Em fans are whack and don't know anything about hip-hop, and Em is not hard nor from the hood, he's just as horrible as his competition ICP (which are abysmal, that should tell you something). I don't want to waste any more space writing what people wrote already, trust me, if you love rap/hip-hop, avoid this and all his releases. Peace.

0385335482|3.0|I bought the book because I consider myself a bit of a shopaholic.  However, I am a conservative shopaholic, meaning, though I must buy cashmere sweaters calling my name, I will not go into debt doing it.  I love to shop but I'm also always on top of my finances.  <br /> <br />That said, the book itself is a fun read.  But I did catch myself getting upset a few times in the beginning because I simply didn't approve of her actions.  Yes, its only a book and its suppose to be entertaining.  I had to keep reminding myself of this for me to go on (shopping excursions are fun!  the store, the merchandise... very fun).   <br /> <br />If you're not a finance freak, this is a fun book.  Just be aware, if you are a finance freak, it might get you upset time to time!  :-) <br /> <br />
B0000025DT|5.0|In 1976 Jeff Lynne and ELO rose to the lofty heights of rock superstars experiencing lifestyle few musicians ever dare to dream of. The future had been most definitely prepared with the previous two albums the majestic Eldorado and the more commercial Face The Music. and therefore it was with little surprise that A New World Record was a massive worldwide success. What did come as a surprise was just how big a success it proved. Upon it's release, it went straight up the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and everywhere else and quickly became one of the biggest selling albums of the year and of all time. What further added to the surprise was the complexity and depth of the songs on the album, each and every one a mini masterpiece in some way or other. Whether it was the feverish beat of Tightrope the majestic Shangr-la the energy of Do Ya or the depth of emotion within Telephone Line the album explored concepts and musical height only a few other popular albums or bands had done before them.  <br />There was something almost frightening about the competency and mastery of Lynne's songs and production, something which left his peers within the music world looking woefully inexperienced. <br />The whole musical experience had well and truly gelled and Jeff Lynne and ELO entered their most popular and financially rewarding phase of their existence. <br />A truly magical album.

B0002OXVDW|4.0|Magnificent excerpts that made up the three MGM films, from 1974, 1976 and 1994, show how great the MGM stable of stars was.  The three skimpy program booklets, however, identify only the titles of the musical numbers and not the films from which they came.  For that you have to go to an on-screen display. <br /> <br />As an author of a book on Jimmy Durante and enthusiastic fan of his, I was hoping to find on the 4th DVD disc the two musical numbers Durante made for THE ZIEGFELD FOLLIES (1946)and then dropped before release.  But no such luck.  Do these clips still exist somewhere in the vaults?  In any case there is an outtake from THIS TIME FOR KEEPS (1947) with Durante singing a bedtime song, \\"Little Big Shot,\\" to cute little Sharon McManus. <br /> <br />The bonus disc of outtakes contains 16 clips, the most interesting possibly being Lena Horne singing \\"You Got Looks\\" and \\"You Won't Forget Me,\\" outtakes from MEET ME IN LAS VEGAS (1956) and DUCHESS OF IDAHO (1950) respectively.  There are no printed program notes but there is a complete on-screen list of credits. <br /> <br />The color on all 4 discs is very good and the use of widescreen where appropriate is much appreciated.
B000002IGP|5.0|I got this album several weeks before the video for Round And Round was being played regularily on MTV. I think I was looking for Born In America by Riot (classic!) and got this instead. I was quite pleased that I got it though! This is an album that I enjoy listening to from start to finish. Maybe that was the good thing about cassettes. You had to listen to every song or wait for your player to fast forward. Nowadays it's too easy to say \\"I don't like this song\\" and fast forward without giving the songs a chance to grow on you. Anyhow, the riffs of Crosby and Demartini rock and Stephen Pearcy, even though not a virtuoso, has a cool rock voice. Highlights are Wanted Man, You're In Trouble, Round And Round, In Your Direction, and Back For More. The albums that followed each had some good tunes but they could never recapture the raw energy of this album!
B0000025DV|5.0|Oh Jeff, what an album, what a masterpiece, not only did he write an album to rival A New World Record but he bettered it with what is regarded within some musical circles as one of the most powerful and greatest double albums of all time. Not only were the songs individually brilliantly constructed and produced, but they played of one and other, further enhancing the overall feel given off by the album. <br />The album oozed witht talent from every aspect, won Jeff and ELO multiple awards and went down as one of the best selling albums of all time. Tracks such as Turn To Stone,Sweet Talkin Woman and Mr Blue Sky became anthems which represented an entire era of the 70's and which still receive massive airplay and appreciation. All of side 3 was dedicated to a Lynne inspired mini-concerto, which could easily be regarded as one of the best sides of an album ever produced. Along with the immensity of Night In The City, Birmingham Blues, Steppin Out and the timeless Wild West Hero, Out Of The Blue was an inspiration, it would seem that Jeff could do no wrong, going from strength to strength with every album, playing to packed out 100,000 seat arenas and making an absolute packet! <br />Who could say the great Jeff Lynne didn't deserve it? <br />
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made (just behind \\"Grind\\")! No joke, it's frickin' hilarious. I saw it twice at the movie theaters and can't wait to see it again. If you haven't seen it - well, you should.
B0000025DR|5.0|This was another very successful album for Jeff Lynne and the boys but how successful this album was took Jeff Lynne a little by surprise. He opted for a more electric sound, reinforced by strings of his newly constructed and most enduring band.<br /><br />Face The Music had all the offerings of a brilliant album and took Jeff and his band to new heights and Lynne's respect from musical colleagues both as a producer and songwriter began to really kick in. The famous Jeff Lynne sound had begun to appear, namely on the beautiful Strange Magic the amazing rocker Poker the lush Waterfall and the sensual One Summer Dream. As for the instrumnetal opening track Fire On High, words fail me. It's astounding and the perfect track to open the album. In addition ELO found great worldwide success in Evil Woman, massively successful and it further invited the listener to see what the bands next step would be.<br /><br />The seeds of evolution had been sown but no-one not even Jeff Lynne could have dreamed of the success that awaited him.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|This music presented tidings of comfort and joy.  A great Broque picture of life at the holiday times.  In the center of the music information insert of the CD was a \\"Motley Crew\\" just like \\"Jetho Tull\\" of the old days. How could this group of people find Christmas so wonderful.  They do it so well bringing Christmas back to the times of faith and good will within our own loss of large family with fun.  This is the best Christmas music of the Holiday season last year.  Get it this year.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|With the recent events in Iraq and the current state of leadership in the White House, Stanley Kubrick's savage black comedy about nuclear war, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb, is more relevant than ever. It makes perfect sense then, that the folks at Sony-Columbia have re-released this movie on DVD (this is its third incarnation). However, for folks who bought the excellent special edition released three years ago, is it really worth the upgrade?<br /><br />One of the new extras on this 2-DVD set is \\"No Fighting in the War Room or: Dr. Strangelove and the Nuclear Threat,\\" an impressive 30-minute documentary that examines the social and political conditions that inspired and helped shape the film.<br /><br />\\"Inside Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" is an excellent, in-depth 46-minute documentary on the making of Kubrick's masterpiece. This is a fascinating look at how Strangelove came to be with lots of information and eye-witness accounts from the cast and crew that are still alive.<br /><br />\\"Best Sellers or: Peter Sellers and Dr. Strangelove\\" is another new addition and examines the comedic genius of this talented actor. Shirley MacLaine, Roger Ebert and Michael Palin gush about Sellers but the real treat here is rare, vintage home movie footage of the young comedian honing his craft.<br /><br />\\"The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove\\" is a solid profile of Kubrick from his humble beginnings as photographer in New York City to his work on Strangelove. This is a very well done overview of Kubrick's early career but those hungry for more should really check out the superb feature-length documentary on the Kubrick box set.<br /><br />Another new extra is \\"An Interview with Robert McNamara\\" that runs 24 minutes. He talks at length about the real people and events that informed Kubrick's film. McNamara comes off as a little dry at this length and was more palatable in the digestible soundbites on the other extras.<br /><br />There is also \\"Split Screen Interviews with Peter Sellers and George C. Scott\\" that were done on the set of Strangelove for promotional purposes.<br /><br />Finally, there is a \\"Theatrical Advertising Gallery,\\" which showcases the provocative ad campaign for the movie at the time.<br /><br />Dr. Strangelove is a nightmare comedy about annihilation. For the satire of the film to work, we must be distanced from the seriousness of the subject. In effect, by the film's end, we have learned to \\"love the bomb\\" as the film's title suggests, by giving into the comic, satirical nature of the movie. Kubrick's film is eerily relevant now because much of what he was mocking still exists. President George W. Bush is a mixture of the gung-ho, might-make-right of General Ripper and the cowboy antics of Major Kong, with the bumbling incompetence of President Muffley. The new extra material is quite good but not really worth double-dipping unless you are a dedicated fan of this movie. However, for newcomers, this is the version to get.able in the digestible soundbites on the other extras. <br /> <br />There is also \\"Split Screen Interviews with Peter Sellers and George C.

B0002OERI0|5.0|This is one of their best albums yet. Yes it is different and I like the change. Best songs are \\"American Idiot\\", \\"Jesus of suburbia\\" and \\"homecoming\\" but all the others are great too. Yes they aren't that punkish but I would still classify them as punk. And I'm obsessed with punk (misfits, black flag, nofx, casualties, subhuman, virus, unseen, and Ramones)    <br />Even if you never heard any songs from this album I promise it is worth it!!!  SO GO GET IT!!!
6305181772|4.0|Brian De Palma and Tome Cruise is a pretty good formula for a successful film. If you throw in the fact that it's a clasic TV show with Oscar caliber writers then you have a sure fire hit. Mission Impossible is that and is one of the better spy movies to have come out in recent years. <br /> <br />Ethan Hunt(Cruise) is an IMF agent. He's good at what he does and likes it. He's on a mission in Prague led by his mentor and friend Jim Phelps(Voight). The mission goes all wrong and the whole team is murdered except for Ethan. He escapes death and goes to the CIA for help in Kittridge(Czerny). <br /> <br />Kittridge quickly informs Ethan on how the misson was a whole set up to see who the mole in IMF was. Ethan takes the blame and is disenbowed. He is now on the run trying to find out who framed him and to see if he can stop them in time. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise is a perfect fit for Ethan Hunt. I've seen a little bit of the classic spy show and Cruise is the man. I can't picture anybody else playing the character. This is a fun character for Cruise in what I feel is one of his more fun movies. He gets caught up in dramas and people really forget what kind of action star this guy is. You have to love a leading man that does his own stunts and Cruise work is incredible. The bullet trains sequence is awesome. The instant classic though is what he does in the vault supended from the rope on the pulley system. He had a lot of faith in this movie and the character and even helped produce the movie. Very few people in Hollywood get involved with a movie like Cruise and he is all over this one. <br /> <br />This is a fun movie. This is what I wish \\"License to Kill\\" would have been like. It's fun and pretty unpredictable, though they do give you some none obvious clues to who the killer might really be. I knew all along but still enjoyed it. If you love Cruise you have to pick this one up. If you like spy movies you'll also get a kick out of it.  This is a fun movie the whole family can enjoy, and you really won't want to miss this one.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie is a MUST see for everyone.  And than after the movie, please form your own opinion of the FACTS that are presented in the film.  Each person has their own views on if the President is the man to be in office.  Just like each person should form their own opinion of this film without name calling and degrading people or their stances.  If you would like to see a well down flick that presents facts, yes facts, they can and are proven in this film, and if you have the intellect to process the information presented and make your own decision and argue that reasonably than this film is a good watch.  Humans are rational people that are capable of making sound decisions, lets start acting like that and this country and world would be a much better place!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|You can call Jet whatever you want. You can say they steal chords or any other accusations you want to make. I don't care because these guys are Rock N Roll. They have catchy tribute tunes that are fun to sing along with and rock out to. Get Born is one of if not the best CD's released in 2003. These guys just keep getting more and more popular and it's easy to see why. <br /> <br />The album opens with \\"Last Chance.\\" I like this song. It's some nice cathcy guitar rifts in it. I love the parts in the song were they all break out into a wooooh. It was great seeing them do this song live. <br /> <br />One of the catchiest songs ever done is next with \\"Are You Gonna be My Girl.\\" Jet really should thank Itunes for what they did in helping popularize this song. It's catchy in every aspect of the song. From the lyrics to all the instruments. I like this song even though it did get kind of old on the radio. <br /> <br />Rollover DJ is the third song. Once again Jet delivers a great catchy song. The chorus is fun to sing along to and this song has some good lyrics. To often now adays do clubs have sorry DJ's when they should be getting some great live acts. Way to represent rock n roll. <br /> <br />The Oasis like \\"Look What You've Done\\" is next. This is a beautiful ballad. Some critcs have said it's full of silly over the top love cliches but who cares. It's a pretty song where Nic Cester gets to display his vocals. All the sappy romantics should fall for this song. They really sound like Oasis on this song and that's always a good thing. <br /> <br />\\"Get What you Need\\" follows up Look What with another catchy rock song that really sounds like an old Rolling Stones song. When I saw these guys in concert they really did remind me a lot of the Stones. The song has a great chorus with the guys shadowing each other. <br /> <br />\\"Move On\\" is another good ballad. It's got a cathcy chorus with some good lyrics. Sometimes you have to move on and this song wont be one that you'llwant to skip. I love the acoustic guitar work in it, and it reminded me of Noel in Oasis. Especially when they did it in concert. <br /> <br />Radio Song is another ballad but this one will make you think the Beatles. It's kind of ironic that they are singing a great catchy ballad called Radio Song that hasn't been played on the radio. Thats what they talk about in the song, and once again Jet has another song that you'll enjoy singing along with. <br /> <br />\\"Get Me outta Here\\" is one of my favorite songs off the album. It's hard, fast, and just great. It's what Rock N Roll is all about. I love the guitar in this song. <br /> <br />\\"Cold Hard Bi*** is next up. This song got a ton of radio play. It's pretty accurate to the song writing. There were a lot of angry women when they played this song, which was funny because a lot of the women were accurately described in the song. Once again this is song with catchy guitar rifts and lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"Come Around Again\\" is another ballad by Jet. It reminds  me of Radio Song. I still like the 70's like theme to it. I love how these guys put  four ballads on an album and none sound alike. They are all similar, but not the same. Some more good song writing here. <br /> <br />\\"Take It or Leave It\\" is another like Oasis song. Jet has been very vocal on how the Gallagher brothers band was an influence to them and the album is full of it. The beginning sounds like an Oasis song, but it breaks out a little faster and harder than something Noel would write. It's still cathcy though and I enjoy the song. <br /> <br />\\"Lazy Gun\\" is another Oasis like song. It sounds a lot like \\"Force of Nature\\" but isn't as good. It's some catchy drum lines in it and the lyrics aren't that bad to the song either. <br /> <br />\\"Timothy\\" finishes the song up in Beatle like fashion. I've heard they stole this guitar rift from somebody, but frankly I don't care. It's some good lyrics and another catchy ballad from Jet. <br /> <br />This album is what Rock N Roll is all about and thats having a good time. In this Pop Rock MTV age these guys are a breath of fresh air. They have that Euro rock sound to them, but they don't sound the same in every song they do like some of the other garage rock stuff that busted out the last couple of years. These guys have said this album pays homage to their idols, and they do an outstanding job in tribute to their idols. If you want a great Rock N Roll album this pick this one up. It's a fun album you'll want to listen to every song to and no serious rock collection is compete without it. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|The re-election of Bush proves that there's an ignorant side to America. But, I suppose if I voice my opinion and state something negative about my country that makes me a bad guy. Sounds more like Communism than Democracy. Michael Moore is voicing his opinion, backed with facts, on his country. A country that he's proud of and wants to make better. I congratulate him on his work and release of Fahrenheit 9/11.<br /><br />Now for the 1 star reviews from republican conservatives who most likely haven't seen the movie........ It's a shame how most republicans follow and support other republicans when you should be supporting and following principles. Think about that.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album should be called ass kicking in a can. I'm not going to say something like \\"Don't take this album seriously to enjoy it\\", rather you should just understand that it's a celebration of living. I think they are very serious about getting that message across and they do a damn good job. Just turn it up and go freak'n crazy. Bash your god damn head against the freak'n wall!!!!! Or keep that pole up your ass and keep thinking you are too \\"hardcore\\" or \\"punk\\" or even \\"smart\\" for this album. Your choice.
B00008H2LB|4.0|If you enjoyed Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory, you will most likely enjoy Meteora also as long as you go in with the right frame of mind.  If you're expecting something different from Linkin Park or some experimentation on their part you will be disappointed. But if you know that, just like their first album, you're getting quality music even though it may be formulaic and don't expect something different then I think you'll find another great album from Linkin Park. <br /> <br />The songs on this album sound very similar to their previous album, but hey \\"if it ain't broke then why fix it\\".  Linkin Park knows what they're good at and they stick to it, which in my mind is better than trying to be something they're not and producing garbage. <br /> <br />Meteora sports 13 tracks (including an intro) of muscular and energetic hard rock that will get your head shaking to the beat.  Again Linkin Park proves that they are one of the best bands in the rap/rock genre.  From start to finish, the songs are fast paced and soundly done.  If anything, Linkin Park have improved their raw musical skills over Hybrid Theory.  The guitars are heavy and the drums are loud and the vocals are still amazing.   <br /> <br />My favourite tracks on the album are:  <br />- Don't Stay - fast pace, heavy beat, driving vocals, sets the tempo for the rest of the album <br />- Faint - different beat to it, hard vocals, one of the best songs <br />- From the Inside - great lyrics and beat, contains the most rap  <br />- Numb - one of the softer songs (king of like \\"In the End\\"), amazing vocals on this one, good way to conclude the album <br /> <br />So, if you liked Linkin Park's first album and want more of the same then I definately recommend Meteora.  However, if you didn't enjoy their first album or you're looking for something different then don't get the album.
B00008US8R|5.0|Well, the review title tells it all. Bravo!
B000002UAX|5.0|Saying the Beatles were not a good band is like saying George Washington was not a good President, or Beethoven was not a good Composer.   <br />    Claude Monet, Edgar Allen Poe, etc.  These people were born with a gift, an undeniable gift from God that is manifested in their work.  This is why you still recognize these names today.  John Lennon and Paul McCartney were born with the gift to create songs. <br />   The quality of anything is represented by its longevity.  Shakespeare lived four hundred years ago, and we still read his works today.  The Pyramids of Giza still stand as a tourist attraction, and Beethoven is still played on TY commercials.  PEOPLE RECOGNIZE QUALITY.  I guarentee Beatle music will still be played hundreds of years from now, what with the all-Beatle radio stations and tribute bands.  <br />  If you can't hear it, its your loss, you are damned to a life of not being able to enjoy real music when you hear it.
B000007SPT|5.0|This is the first of 3 Mortal coils and is the brainchild of the founding fathers of the 4AD label.This is a combination of artists that were on the label at the time and include coctaua twins, dead can dance and others.Performing mostly covers albeit obscure ones with great instrumental interludes is a trip through the looking glass and beyond.If you like to listen to a meld of music that flows in and out of time then this is for you.The \\"Coils\\" have often been  pushed into the \\"Goth\\" catogory but are beyond actual defenition.This was released in the early 80`s and untill a reprinting in 98 was hard to find.The songs are uncoventional and beautiful. They fit together like hand and glove.If you are looking for something to just take you away then this is it.If you pick this up you will not be dissapointed because it is a great CD and worth adding to your collection
B00001ZT0K|3.0|With the complete implosion of Uriah Heep's lineup during 1980-81, leaving guitarist Mick Box as the sole remaining member, it looked like the end of the line for the band. Mr. Box, however, showed the stuff that he's made of, and determined to soldier on. Drummer Lee Kerslake was persuaded to rejoin the band in the absence of his long-time nemesis (organist Ken Hensley), bringing along bassist Bob Daisley, whom he had worked with in the Blizzard of Ozz. Keyboardist John Sinclair, who had toured with Heep as part of opening act Heavy Metal Kids would take Hensley's place, and as original Heep vocalist David Byron had previously turned down Mick's offer to rejoin the band, the call went out to Trapeze vocalist Pete Goalby (probably much to Ken Hensley's chagrin, as he has long maintained that he had preferred Goalby over John Sloman as a replacement for John Lawton, and eventually quit the band over his dissatisfaction with Sloman's vocals).  <br /> <br />With the lineup now in place, Heep recorded Abominog, which, while it has some good material (\\"That's The Way That It Is\\", \\"Sell Your Soul\\", \\"Too Scared To Run\\", \\"On The Rebound\\"), doesn't generally live up to the quality of songs that Heepsters had gotten used to expecting since 1970, and the production hasn't dated well at all: Heep albums like Demons and Wizards, Sweet Freedom, Firefly, Sea Of Light, or Sonic Origami sound timeless; Abominog screams \\"this was recorded in 1982\\". It's certainly a decent effort, and worth a listen, and as a commercially successful \\"comeback\\" album, it's one of their most important, but it's certainly not in the realm of \\"Classic Heep\\".
B00005BL2A|4.0|\\"Exciter\\" is, frankly, anything but. Composed of mostly low key ambiance, the first Depeche Mode album of the new century chose to speak softly rather than carry a big stick. While that means there are no instant classics ala \\"Strange Love\\" or \\"Personal Jesus,\\" it also allows the album to grow on you and stick more than, for instance, the paint-by-numbers \\"Ultra.\\" With Alan Wilder now out of the band, the remaining trio of Modesters have sobered up and redefined the sound.<br /><br />It makes \\"Exciter\\" a spotty effort, but hard to ignore. The two main hits, \\"Dream On\\" and \\"I Feel Loved\\" are prime Depeche Mode. \\"I Feel Loved\\" even comes across as near Kraftwerk. The remaining songs are almost like a distant cousin to \\"Black Celebration,\\" DM's darkest album. Where \\"Celebration\\" was centered on manipulation, doom and other obliquely depressing themes, \\"Exciter\\" is still a downer of a record with the downers more aimed at personal problems. \\"Breathe\\" diagrams the rumor mill that tears a relationship apart, and \\"When The Body Speaks\\" profiles an obsession. It also happens to be a beautiful, cathartic song, exactly what I always want from my Depeche Mode CDs. It's nice to hear them entering the next phase of their career clean and sober and making mature music for Goth folks.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|This is a wonderful album of deftly drawn portraits. Hearing it a few times, it gets better and better. \\"5:15 AM\\" is a treat, tough, tender and revisits many of Mark's favorite themes. \\"Postcard from Paraguay\\" is terrific, fresh and innovative -- hooks you! \\"Boom Like That\\", \\"Don't Crash The Ambulance\\" -- classic, sardonic MK - delicious. Do yourself a favor -- buy this album and enjoy.
B000002JKA|5.0|I picked this album up for $5.99 while on vacation, having heard good things about DT (im mainly into stuff like MegaDeth, metallica, anthrax, ect) and was pleasantly surprised. the album is quite long, but very good. john pertucci is a talented guitarist, but his solos often just seem like speed runs through scales. other than that, great album <br />track-by track guide: <br />1: 6:00 - totally cool song, dont know why some people dont like it. best track on the album, good guitar work and great vocals from james 10/10 <br />2: Caught in a Web - this was the first DT song i had heard prior to purchasing this album, it was good then, but pales in comparison to other tracks 8/10 <br />3: Innocence Faded - Great guitar intro, somewhat quiet track, his vocals go too high at some parts, though 8/10 <br />4a: Voices - first part of a three part 'song', i like the intense part at one part of the song 8/10 <br />5b: Erotomania - a lot of people liked this instrumental, but i dont see much special in it(part 2 of 'a mind beside itself) 7/10 <br />6c: The silent man - the last part of the 3 part track, a really cool acoustic tune 9/10  <br />7: The Mirror - Second heaviest song on the album, which is a good change of pace, heavy, downtuned riffs (sounds like johns guitar is in Drop B or something) 8/10 <br />8: Lie - the mirror transists into the heaviest song, Lie. one of my favorites from 'Awake' it doesnt end as good as it starts 9/10 <br />9: Lifting shadows off a dream - dont really remember much from this track.. 6/10 <br />10: Scarred - really long track.. starts off with a cool jazzy guitar solo/intro 8/10 <br />11: Space-Dye Vest - really weird song.. somewhat of a ballad.. its really deep, somewhat sad. hard to get into but good closer to the album 8/10 <br /> <br />in short, i recommend this album, especially if you can get it for the price i did
B000002UEB|5.0|The title speaks for itself. Leaving alone that this a concept album ,it's practically impossible to sort out the best songs because the whole work is a masterpiece: so I don't mean to talk about the songs. <br /> <br />OM is one of the rare example of records that don't belong to any musical genre. It represents an absolute milestone, whatever your musical preferences are; it's something new and innovative;a starting point that has influenced so many other bands. <br /> <br />The impact of this album is so heavy and captivating that the other Q's albums seem to be on a lower step, although they don't really are : as a faithful and since-the-very-beginning fan of Q -do you remember the very first EP, Queen of the Reich - I find \\"Rage for order\\" and \\"Promised Land\\" two olther masterpieces of the band , even if from another point view (but this is another story). <br /> <br />The experience of enjoying live the whole OM is something unforgettable.It happened to me at least twice and the first one, in Milan in 1990, was something I 'll always remember:a triumph of music and committment; a lesson of what a live show must be. <br /> <br />Q are planning a new chapter, OM II: I'm looking forward to hearing it, hoping they could regain the favours of all fans all over the world (not mine, I never left 'em alone).
0749858524|3.0|I bought about 20 of these titles while in Australia and my son (almost 3) absloutely loves them.  Of all his book choices in the house and he has lots these are the books he likes to read.  My only gripe is that when the books were brought to the american audience they were altered a bit(americanized) and because of this they lost something about them that made them unique.  I wont buy any more of them that were pinted in the united states and now beg friends to bring them back from England and Australia for me.  If you never saw the overseas version you probably wouldnt notice the difference but if you started on the originals from overseas the american ones are disappointing.  that is the only reason for the 3 stars otherwise i would give them an enthusiastic 5 stars
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have never seen a movie displaying such a strong reality through a commmon and well-known story. In previous films, we see Jesus portrayed on the cross without the cruel reality of actual physical elements. As a Christian, I live by the belief that Christ died for us. It is the basis of Christianity - Jesus, the Son of Man, the Son of God in the flesh, the One and Only begotten Son of God who came to this earth with one thing on His mind - to do the will of the Father. This movie is not only a movie, but it is a story in itself of what Christ went through for us. It realistically displays through slow motion and inch-by-inch the very last hours of Christ's sufferings, as the story told in the Chapter of Luke. It ministered to me and brought me back to the basics of why I believe and why I am a Christian. It is an awakening. This movie was filmed with careful thought. You can tell that Mel Gibson had carefully planned out every scene and worked on this film with such a passion to tell the story of Jesus. It is not just a movie, it's a ministry.
0684803356|5.0|Mark Twain once said that \\"a classic is a book that everyone wants to have read but nobody wants to read.\\" It is a shame that \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is considered a classic, because unlike some of Hemingway's works, this is such an exciting, vivid, impossible-to-put-down novel. It should never be required reading in high school, although intelligent young readers would certainly love it. (Now that I think about it, some of the violent scenes are probably too gory for today's politically correct curriculum anyway.) It is the sort of book that someone's older brother at college lends to them, and then they pass it on to their best friend, and so on. There's a lot to this book beyond the plot, but unlike many other books that strive to explore deep human themes of life, sex and death, this one is approachable and very readable.  <br /> <br />The only reason I can think of not to drop everything and read this book right away (look how cheap the used copies are, for crying out loud!), is if you are planning a long voyage and want to make sure you have something really great to read along the way, in which case I would wait. While I am sorry that I didn't the book myself until I was 34, I had the great gift of reading it on a camping trip amidst hills, streams, pine tress and a rocky coastline that made it easy to imagine myself in the mountains of Spain along with the characters, and that made it worth the wait.
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is the kind of movie I wished they made today - it's got a great plot, it's funny, but intelligently so, and is rather pointed political satire. A truly wonderous film. The DVD has some great special features - such as a fairly lengthy making-of segment. It was filled with interesting tidbits of information and was very much worth watching.<br /><br />Anyone with a DVD player should own this movie.
B00003CXCT|5.0|With the exception of the extended musical sequence in \\"Return of The Jedi\\" and the addition of Greedo's blaster shot, all of the Special Edition added effects (I think) add a great deal to what is the greatest trilogy of movies of all time (yes, even better than LOTR!). \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" is just a staggeringly great movie, and the digital transfer is AMAZING!!! If you are a fan of these movies, DO NOT let the changes prevent you from buying this set. They look gorgeous, and the bonus features are informative, fun and copious!
1400049628|5.0|When I first read through this book, I was deceived into thinking it was a REAL survial guide, it was so realistic. Even after I found out it was all fictitious, I still love this book. I don't have my own copy - yet - but it's very much worth buying.<br /><br />The book is very much like any other survival guide, except this one is about zombies. It starts off by explaining that zombies aren't the product of black magic, but are, in fact, the product of a letal virus. Once someone is infected (via a bite, etc), they will die within a day or so, then revive, with a hunger for flesh. The book describes all manners of combating the undead - swords, guns, explosives - in an effective, safe manner. It also discusses how to fortify your dwelling, how to escape from \\"infested\\" areas, how to clear an area, and much more. The book even includes \\"accounts\\" of the undead, which seem eerily realistic.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a very engrossing and enjoyable read. Fans of zombie movies/books will adore this.
B00005JN0T|2.0|The film is not actually that bad , but instead of been call I Robot it should be call hardwire (scrpt's original name). <br /> <br />For anyone that wants to see an Hollywod action movie its  <br />ok but if you want to see a film based on Asimov book ,don't see it because it's totally based on other story not even closed on   <br />what asimov wanted to tell about it in his books.
0375823360|5.0|These three books are amoung the best pieces of literature on the face of this planet.<br /><br />The first book, The Golden Compass, takes place in a uninverse that is somewhat like ours was in the late 1800s, with a few deliberate changes. The Chuch has absolute power over everyone, dealing with anyone who dares to oppose their views violently. People's souls take the form of shapeshifting creatures known as \\"daemons\\". In this world, a girl named Lyra and her daemon, Pantiliamon, get involved in a strange series of events involving torturous experiments on children, gypsies, witches, talking bears, and gateways to other dimensions. At the end of the book, she sets off for another dimension...<br /><br />The second book, The Subtle Knife, starts off by introducing a new character, Will. This teenage boy comes from a world that is apparently the literary equivalent of OUR world. He finds a portal to the world Lyra left for at the end of the first book. They meet, and explore the haunted city Cittagazze, a strange place plagued by soul-sucking demons. In order to help them in their quest, they seek the Subtle Knife, a device of awesome power.<br /><br />The third book, The Amber Spyglass, the longest of the three, and perhaps the richest, begins right where the second left off. Will , having just learned the truth of his father, teams up with a pair of angels to get Lyra back from her mother. The Church wants Lyra dead, so this complicates things. Meanwhile, Lord Asriel is planning the ultimate war...and Mary Malone, in a strange world inhabited by the mulefa, constructs a device that allows one to see Dust. Lyra and Will's destiny is key to the fate of all universes.<br /><br />These summaries don't BEGIN to do the book justice.These are amoung the most supremely excellent novels. Read them, and you'll find yourself immersed in the gorgeous story Pullman has created.
B00003CXSM|3.0|I actually like Jennifer Lopez, she was great in Maid In Manhattan, and funny in Gigli - yes, I have seen that, and yes I own it! I haven't seen Enough yet, but it's on my wishlist, and I've seen the trailer, it actually looks really good. And of course, on this, she just has to get one of her songs on the soundtrack - this time it was \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\\".<br /><br />What's good about this movie, is how obsessive, neat, and organised J-Lo is. She's always ready for any eventuality in her job as a wedding planner, and even at home, she's the exact same. Everything appears to be at perfect right angles etc. It's like Monica Geller all over again.<br /><br />I'm not that big a fan of Matthew McConaughey (FYI, I'm copying & pasting that!) There is no chemistry/sparks between him & J-Lo, and he also can't act his way out of a paper bag. He's not the worst thing about this movie actually, every joke is forced and completely unoriginal. The classic romcom types are all present and correct: the ethnic, overprotective father; the vapid fianc&eacute;e; the matchmaker best friend etc. And J-Lo is playing an Italian, when it's perfectly obvious she's so NOT. Very miscast in this movie, the actor playing her father looks more Italian than she does.<br /><br />Apart from J-Lo, there are two fantastic actresses in this. Judy Greer, who always seems to play the supporting actress in any movie I've seen her in, and never gets the lead (13 Going On 30 and What Women Want, for example). Joanna Gleason is the other fantastic actress, she's so funny, especially when she's singing, and J-Lo's horse takes off due to the singing! It took a while for me to place her, but of course, she was in Friends! She played Kim, one of Rachel's bosses at Ralph Lauren. She's also done quite a few voices in King Of The Hill.<br /><br />Possibly don't see for J-Lo, but for the supporting actors around her, especially Judy Greer, and Joanna Gleason. Oh, and one of the bigger nuns with the HUGE voice from Sister Act appears in two scenes, with a dreadful short blonde hairstyle. She was also in Rat Race, what's her name?! Mary Wickes? I think? Nope, she's dead. Wrong nun. Kathy Najimy! I'll get there eventually. There's not much more than 'fluff' for extras on this something about cowboys and wedding dresses or some such nonsense.from Sister Act appears in two scenes, with a dreadful short blonde hairstyle.

0345347951|5.0|The people that gave this book a bad rating could not grasp its concepts.  What I got out of it was this.  In life we have religion and science, God and atoms, unexplainable and predictable.   These are tow different things.  Here there is the extreme of both.  One civilization has conquered science and knows everything about the physical world.  And the other is like this physic supernatural being that all humans are connected to through consciences.    What way will humanity go?  To become so entrapped in our physical world, or go back to the old days of religion and meditation.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Her Under My Skin album is the greatest in a long time.  She has a sensational mix of heart-felt and strong messages for an uplifting experience!  Every teen girl should get this album.  It will inspire her to be strong in herself and her environment.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The best night of my life was attending this event at the Royal Albert Hall. The musicianship was unparalleled and the spirit of the evening was transcendant.  <br /> <br />I will not give a synopsis of the concert; it is best to put it in your player, turn the volume up and let it unfold. I highly recommend watching the Complete Concert disc first. <br /> <br />This DVD set is absolutely miraculous in that it almost completely captures the concert AS IT WAS. I really feel as if I am there when I watch it, and I was there. Jeff Lynne's audio production is perfect, and the separation is superlative, especially on the final numbers when there are about a zillion musicians on stage. <br /> <br />Keep an eye out for Steve Winwood in the audience. Tougher to spot is Bill Wyman. Oh, and look for me.
B0000959N0|2.0|Another flick brought out to ride the current wave of comic book hero adaptations - parallels with the Spiderman series are too obvious to point out, but Daredevil has a darker edge to it. Young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra -the best actor in the film for my money) is blinded by radioactive waste and witnesses his father being murdered for refusing to throw a fight. So he grows up (elder Matt played by Ben Affleck) to become a blind pro bono lawyer by day and violent avenger of justice by night, following up gruesome revenge killings by visits to the confessional box. He meets Electra (Jennifer Garner), a beautiful martial arts expert and they fall in love. They combine to fight the forces of evil - Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, excellent and under used) and Bullseye (Collin Farrell - ludicrously over acted).<br /><br />Potentially a good comic book adaptation, but disappointing for the following reasons. Affleck in the lead doesn't act out the role with nearly as much charisma as the comic book hero Daredevil requires. And the film treats his blindness in a slightly too surreal manner- Matt can see people by hearing raindrops fall on them- to be realistic. At other points, he seems to be able to manouever just as well as a sighted person with only the occasional concession to his blindness, as if the director is conscious of the need to highlight Daredevil's handicap but unsure exactly how to go about it.<br /><br />The dialogue is often cliched 'They say when you die your whole life flashes before you' type thing and, at other times, curiously baseless. Such as the priest telling Daredevil during one of his confessions that 'Those who live without fear live without hope'. What does this mean exactly?<br /><br />The fight scenes are often unispiring and at times yawn inducing and the score is too intrusive - often introducing characters to bad rock soundtracks.<br /><br />Is the film enjoyable? At times, yes, there are good scenes. But these are outweighed by the weak ones. As comic book adaptations go, I prefer Spiderman.ed by the weak ones. As comic book adaptations go, I prefer Spiderman.
B000002HPV|5.0|_Homogenic_ is a more dramatic departure from the previous album, relative to the stylistic change from _Debut_ to _Post_. The arrangements here are primarily strings (Icelandic String Octet)and beats + synths. Even though much of the album is more subdued in tone, Bjork's voice is even more varied and expressive, if that were possible, and vocals are often laid atop each other in complex harmony, stacked with effects. The opener, \\"Hunter\\", moves along a quick pulse, electro-snare roll, wave-like strings, and processed accordion sounds (during the chorus), supporting a complex vocal arrangement. \\"Pluto\\" is hard, atonal dance-pop -- broken-casio-like synths bounce on staccato pounds, and Bjork's threatening battle cries are layered and altered so it sounds a mini-Bjork singing at you while flying around your head in a little plane. \\"Bachelorette\\" is a string ballad of epic proportions, slowly crescendoing until the final, highly affecting chorus. Balancing sad and/or angry songs like \\"5 Years\\" and \\"Immature\\" are balanced by uplifting tracks like \\"All is Full of Love\\", \\"State of Emergency\\", and \\"Alarm Call\\". _Homogenic_ is one of Bjork's most emotionally affecting releases, and also one of the most accomplished from a musical/songcraft perspective. Quite possibly the crown jewel for this queen of Icelandic electro-pop.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Jim Carrey plays a heartbroken man so desperate to numb himself from the pain of his lost love that he's willing to subject himself to a treatment that erases his memory of the relationship that lacerated his soul. The treatment requires an invasiveness that can be analgous to advertising and all the other consumer addictions we have at our fingertips in order that we may numb ourselves from life's despair. But the treatment--involving electrodes, computers, and diabolical albeit comic, bumbling mad scientists, must be confronted by Carrey's need to re-awaken his love with his girlfriend played wonderfully by Kate Winslet. In turns funny, tender, and postmodern, Eternal Sunshine is journey into a man's scared, sensitive soul who must resist all the temptations of numbness that our technlogical society has to offer us and, heroically find a love that defines and preserves his humanity.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|i'm getting tired of people equating \\"good\\" with the degree to which a band emulates other fashionable bands.  it is so crystal clear that the singer has been listening to bright eyes, velvet teen, and radiohead.  this album is uncreative, has weak hooks, and will be forgotten in two years.
1591840562|5.0|I have had the pleasure of reading Art of the Start and seeing Guy Kawasaki speak. I was impressed with his ability to provide direct, amusing and effective advice.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Four weeks ago I had not heard of Guy Kawasaki. I first learned about him and his book through a book review and also picked up buzz here and there in articles,  blogs and on Amazon. People seemed to think this guy Guy was fascinating so I bought the book. LOVED IT! I am not interested in venture capital or building boards so I breezed over these parts. I am very interested in how to start and build my business and helping others build theirs. Art of the Start delivers. Guy's tips and techniques are clear and stripped down to the essential must do's. There's no waste and no dull parts to get through to get the good stuff. To use Guy's word for great products - it's Gold. He's funny too, which helped my brain stay engaged.<br /><br />Throughout the book, two dominant themes emerge:<br /><br /> <br /><br />1. Get on with it!<br /><br /> Get your product out there.<br /><br />Don't over-think things, just try something.<br /><br />Avoid second guessing yourself or others, if you want to start something, start it.<br /><br />Be wary of paralysis by analysis.<br /><br />Try many avenues.<br /><br />Be open to uncommon and unknown possibilities for your business and product.<br /><br />Obliterate the barriers that are keeping you from moving forward.<br /><br /> <br /><br />2. Do what you love and make meaning!<br /><br /> Don't worry about what is hot or trendy (by the time you know of trends it is too late anyway!). Create products and services that you love and that solve your problems.<br /><br />Solve new problems, seize new opportunities, or approach a business solution in new way. Don't just build on what's already out there, build something new.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Worry about making meaning first, then making money. If you are producing what you love and it will make life better for others, the money will follow.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The best product and services are loved by their customers. To evangelize your business, you need to be passionate about and believe in what you are doing. The importance of this is paramount.<br /><br />You may need to reenergize and remind yourself that the focus is on making meaning.<br /><br /> I've learned a lot from Guy's book and by hearing him talk. Art of the Start can help us kick-start our endeavors and improve our chances of success and satisfaction. Guy Kawasaki is one of those folks who changes the lives of the people he touches. He has changed mine and I would invite you to let him change yours.and services are loved by their customers.

B000002JNJ|5.0|The first Pantera song I ever heard was \\"Hollow\\", after a friend recommended me to the band I went and downloaded that song, I liked it. But it was'nt until hearing Cowboys From Hell (the song) until I was really hooked. A little while ago I went out and bought Cowboys From Hell, and since then I have to say that Pantera is the best damn metal band ever. And the production of this album blows me away! It's pure perfection. And with tracks like \\"Domination\\" and \\"The Art of Shredding\\" the guitar tone just slices through your ears! I love it! And of course the song \\"Cemetery Gates\\" is perfect, it has everything in a song I could ever want. I recommend this album for anyone who likes fast, agressive metal. My only problem with it is that it does'nt feel long enough, and after track 12 it leaves me wanting more. But I guess that's what the other albums are for. (Vulger Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven are just as good as this one)
B0000931QR|5.0|I don't understand a word they are saying but I love the music.  I was using my seek button on the radio when I hit on the song \\"Rosas\\".  It took me two weeks and many phone calls to finally find the radio station that had played the song.  They in turn played songs for me until I identified the one I heard.  Hearing this music and listening to the girl's voice brought tears to my eyes because the melody is so beautiful and the girl's voice is like an angel's voice might sound.  I wish above all else that I understood the language but it speaks to me in ways I guess only someone that doesn't understand the language can appreciate the talent.

The fusion of the semi-driver flashing mph finger signals to our hero as he pushes himself to the limit with heart pumping classical music in the background is the best visual definition of \\"personal best \\" ever seen in the movies.
B00000I8BX|5.0|Who the hell decided to give a fake title to such a great album? This album rules! \\"Resurrection\\" is a grand 6 minute epic, and \\"Descent\\" wants your CD to stick in the CD player. The masters of crushing industrial metal have definitely come up with an album that went gold. (I am telling the truth, the album went gold.) A must-have for all headbangers out there!
0380973464|5.0|A wonderful book.  This is one of those works of art that within a few pages gives so much pleasure to read that it's almost criminal.  This is intelligent, funny, moving writing.  Stephenson expects the reader to have sufficient education in science and technology that he can appeal to that knowledge to make many of his telling points tell.  I've never seen a novel with graphs in until now, or one whose author is sufficiently confident that he can spend several pages explaining some pretty obscure - but extremely interesting - features of the Enigma machine.  But it isn't all heavy technological stuff; there's an element of Terry Pratchett as well.  Before you're a couple of pages in, you come across the following: <br /> <br />\\"Let's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo - which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.\\" <br /> <br />The story flashes back and forth between events taking place in the Second World War and in the present day.  In the first, Allied cryptographers, both historical (Alan Turing) and fictional (Lawrence Waterhouse, the son of Godfrey), do battle with their Axis counterparts.  In the second, their descendants develop a data haven using modern computer-based cryptography.  In both threads Stephenson treats us to layer on layer of deception, bluff, and double bluff, now hilarious, now tragic, now  threatening, and always unflinching, even dead-pan. <br /> <br />The plot of this book is simple, perhaps almost disappointingly so, but the short segments of the story are each individually delightful, and the characters are endearing and lively.  One such is Bobby Shaftoe, a drug-soaked U.S. marine killing-machine who makes up haiku.  Another, perhaps the main character, is Randy Waterhouse, the grandson of Lawrence, an overweight computer nerd who lives for cryptography and networks.  And so it goes, with villains, good guys, beautiful Pussy Galore-like women, nasty men in suits, a full, rich and wonderful cast of characters. <br /> <br />Books like this make you glad you learned to read.  And that you paid attention in physics class. <br />
B0002JJBZE|4.0|Actually, I rate the shows 5 stars, but give the extras where they interviewed Bill Shatner, good, but why did they interview the man with the golden voice when he had a cold?  Also, I would have liked to see a DeForest Kelley interview put in there, even though he passed away.  Last but not least, why doesn't Sulu have his picture on one of the DVDs?  Much better than the alien pictures.  I can't compare it with season one because I haven't purchased it yet, but I plan to get all 3 eventually.  By the way, those complaining about the price, it is expensive, but isn't it better than taping it from the Sci Fi Channel?  At least it's not as bad as what Paramount did to Norhern Exposure.  All in all, I will enjoy these episodes to the hilt.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Perhaps the average person will most likely miss the surreal nature of this film.  It is so nice to see something so unconventional make the major cinema though.  Like many of Gondry's music videos, there is a dream-like quality to this story.  While Jim Carry loses his memories, Gondry paints a picture of at first, a spiteful couple with nothing but bitterness towards each-other to then, a pair of misunderstood individuals with a relationship that is both sad, and yet wonderful.  The story of Joel and Clementine is presented from end to beginning, which seemed to confuse people.  But honestly, if you can not get past that, you are not going to understand this movie at all.  If you follow the flow of this film and let it take you away, it will do just that, take you away.  I was so sucked in, that, near the end I found myself trying to hold on to Joel's memories with him.  If you are new to Michel Gondry's style or any film that has not been done in a traditional sense, then again, this one is not for you.  But if you enjoyed Being John Malkovich or maybe even Lost in Translation, then I suggest you have a go at this film.  It is full of eye candy and you will see something new every time you watch it. <br /> <br />
B00005JN0T|4.0|This movie had a great conception of the future, and I thought that a good design was chosen for the robots. Endless action is included in this film; especially in compelling scenes involving sideways driving, evasion of sinister robots, and a gigantic robot that demolishes an inhabited home. The plot was fairly adequate also; with many various unexpected occurrences that contributed to the overall storyline. I, Robot was a respectable film for its intense scenes, the good selection of characters, and clever factors early in the movie that play in later on. I would recommend it to all who enjoy action films or who relish the futuristic factors of a movie.
B000020617|5.0|And I thought \\"One By One\\" was good.  This album is a lot better than One By One.  Definately a must-have for Foo Fighter fans.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Unless you really liked the Green Day sound when they first hit the charts, you won't find any significant stretch here. There is no comparison of this album to the classic ones done by Pink Floyd, The Who, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Time will show that. <br /> <br />Green Day needs to drop the punk persona and really start exploring. There is talent in Green Day but they are trapped in the sophmoric, punk sound which has been limiting them. If they want to be timeless/classic artists, they need to obtain a broader appeal.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I am a huge fan of tight technical music (PROG rock like King Crimson, YES, TOOL, Pink Floyd, The Dillinger Escape Plan, etc..) These guys sound like Dillinger meets Radiohead meets Bjork. Sure, you could draw paralels between Mars Volta and Rush, because all technically great music tends to sound a bit like Rush. De-loused sounds a lot like the YES albums \\"Fragile\\" or \\"Close to the Edge\\". Obviously, its a little heavier than YES, but thats only because of new production techniques. Its great to see new PROG talent. This album is worth the listen.
0688163173|3.0|This book wasn't entirely bad, and is good airplane reading material, but overall it didn't live up to the hype from other reviewers, and it certainly isn't five-star worthy. That being said, it's an easy read and initially very intriguing.<br /><br />The main problem with this book is that any avid reader with an imagination will easily figure out the \\"twist\\" because it's one that is repeatedly used in various thrillers. And once that is figured out, well, it's not as interesting anymore and there's just not much left to the story. I basically ended up finishing it in anticipation that somehow my hunch would be wrong and I would be dumbfounded with an incredible revelation - didn't happen! And some explanations for events I couldn't completely put together seemed shallow and left me feeling a little robbed.<br /><br />It's not terrible, I give it 3 stars, but leave potential readers with a warning not to expect grand things from this book.
6305090564|5.0|Deep Rising is a fun movie. Great bad guys and lots of humor. Is does remind me of Tremors but the cruise ship location provides an extra claustrophobic tension. I'd recommend it.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Ah yes, I remember Moore's statements on how no one who saw his movie could vote for Bush. The bloated liar was so convinced that Bush would lose, and his film would have a hand in it. It appears that the American people are not as gullible as Moore thinks. In the movie Moore makes fun of and villifies Bush... a lot. But on this day after the election I have just one question for michael moore. Who is laughing now?
B0002I831S|3.0|Priced at about double what it should be, and lacking the pilot. Nice extras, but not worth the extra bucks. Good to see all the shows in one package, but lets get the price down!
B0002EXH40|5.0|i played the original first, sounded good. i then played the remaster immediately afterward and just about brought the roof down. i'm not sure why some are reporting that there isn't much of a sound difference between the two.     clean, crisp and powerful best describes this CD. well done, Dave!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|body and great moves, but her CD is full of danceable hits.<br /><br />\\"Toxic\\" is my favorite song as well as \\"Outrageous.\\"  Other songs I like include \\"Breathe On Me,\\"Boom Boom,\\" \\"Early Mornin',\\" and \\"Me Against the Music(feat. Madonna).<br /><br />I may not like her personal lifestyle, but her latest CD is the best she produced.
B000050XEI|4.0|At 34-and-a-half minutes long, this wonderful album is like sitting down for a sumptious meal, but the portions are small! Evidently Enya has striven for quality instead of quantity on this work and in that she has once again succeeded; indeed, just the selections \\"Fallen Embers\\" or \\"A Day Without Rain\\" make the album definitely \\"worth it\\" for me. Roma Ryan's soul-opening lyrics are again a perfect complement to Enya's angelic singing and flowing orchestral arrangements. If you enjoy purity, grace, sensitivity and wisdom, this album is for you. <br />
B00002ND77|5.0|As a black man, I do not agree with most of Malcom's militant  views...its was reverse racism in many ways....but you cannot help but appreciate his place in american history...and this movie is undeniably a superb example of a film biopic...Weather you love or hate Macolm you cannot deny this movie as being a masterpiece.....and to the person who said muslims hate white people...Malcom was first a part of the Nation of Islam....which is not exactly the same Islam as it is practived in  its home the middle east....Islamic followers or Muslims are not terrorists and the religion it self is not one of vilence and murderes that hate white people...did you even see the film???....when Macolm went to Mecca to see how Islam was meant to be practiced he converted and began to change his views of white people....This in turn leaded to his assasination... he also discoverd that their are plenty of white followers of the Muslim faith... <br /> <br />SO before you bathe in the pool of ignorance...pick up a book and read about the religion and its teachings...its not a religion that discrimiinates nor does it tell people to go blow up buildings...they follow the 10 commandments just as Jews and chrsitians do...it teaches peace and love. <br /> <br />So please dont take the views of a handful of idiots who \\"murder in the name of Allah\\"...which is a complete twisting of the words of the Q'ran as a representation of what the Islamic faith is about...Those people are just crazy and use religion as an excuse, and belive me they are wrong in the eyes of true muslims....  <br /> <br />and by the way Iam a christian...but i also have sense enough to respect others beliefs and not blame 9/11 on an entire faith rather than a few crazy idividuals with no cause....I mean look at the KU KLUXX KLAN...they hate ALL non-whites all in the name of christianity and murder in the name of Christ...does that mean all christians are terrorist who hate all non-white...NO..the KKK is a group not similar to the fools who blew up the towers..so single them out not all followers of the religion.. <br /> <br />so i say to you...please read, educate yourself before you speak on the matter at hand... <br /> <br />
B0001AP12G|5.0|Its very rare for me to be able to listen to a hip hop album from start to finish but this one is an exception.  The College Dropout has to be one of the best albums to come out this year.   <br />The production is on point and I can definitely relate to the lyrics on songs such as \\"Spaceship\\", \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"All Falls Down\\".  I'm definitely looking forward to hearing more albums from Kanye.
B00030590I|5.0|not only was the storyline interesting and engaging (its much harder to pay attention to a movie that you have to read) it was beautifully filmed with a classical, silent, emotional feel using not only the emotion of the actors but the scenery... action doesnt have to be explosions and gross violence and this flick shows it. There are so many underlying statements and issues hidden within this movie, there is no point to go into them. <br /> <br />this is the level of entertainment that hollywood should aspire to.
068987474X|5.0|I saw so much of myself in this book. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me kick a guy to the curb and I'm very happy that I made this purchase. I think every woman who is in or out of a relationship that is not 100% satisfying and finds herself constantly making excuses for why he won't call or email or go out or whatever, should pick up this book, read it from cover to cover and get a copy for all of her single friends too. This book really opened me eyes to mistakes I've made over the years and I realize that I did \\"waste the pretty\\" for too long on guys who didn't deserve it and while I was with those jerks, perfectly good men who did want me were ignored. This book will make you realize that there are other options but if you're stuck with a complete jerk you won't be free to explore them.
B00063F8B2|5.0|I loved this CD. I didn't really want to see the movie but now will have to. This CD will be a perfect Christmas gift for my girls (all in their 20s). Although our musical tastes are completely different, they love Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and Perry Como at Christmas time. This sampling will be perfect. Alan Silvestri's music is wonderful, and of course, the Josh Groban song is worth the price of the whole CD.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek dominated the animated full length feature category in 2001 (and some would say it still does) and the reasons why are clear: The movie moves at a good pace, with excellent painstaking animation and perfectly chosen voices for the characters. There is much humor for both adults and children; I know even some comparatively conservative adults who brought this children to see this movie and they certainly didn't regret it! GRIN<br /><br />In many ways the film (as you probably already know) sets the traditional fairy tale type of story on its head--the guy who saves the princess is an irascible ogre named Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers. Shrek has a somewhat manic Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) for a pal. Donkey, as the donkey is called--will do anything for Shrek's friendship--except keep quiet. hahaha I thought that the donkey helped balance Shrek's irritable nature well into the film but perhaps the donkey could have been given a few more clever lines in the second half of the film. Then there's the princess. The princess herself is someone with whom we all can relate to because she's not really a beautiful image of perfection--in actuality she's not what she seems! (Don't want to spoil the plot here so I'm being vague; please understand!) Some other interesting relationships develop along the way involving a dragon, Lord Farquaad, who wants to marry Fiona, the princess, just so he could be king, and the fairy-tale people of other classic fairy tales! However, too much of the plot I am certainly not about to give away! GRIN<br /><br />I was most amused by how the film pokes fun at classic fairy tales such as Snow White and Pinocchio. The most amusing lampoon was of Disney's Magic Kingdom which in the movie is actually the not too friendly home of Lord Farquaad. Watch it and see which famous Disney attraction is made fun of first! Hehehe<br /><br />The animation and quality of the picture are excellent. The sound is excellent, too. But the good news is this: DreamWorks went much further! The two DVDs offer much more than just the film in both full screen and wide screen. Indeed, the list of extras on both DVDs seems to simply go on and on! There are many children's games along with numerous interviews and story plots that were deleted. There are some technical goofs which are good for another laugh and even a short featurette about the dubbing of the film for international audiences. You get to see how the drawing of each main character developed and there's even playing hints for Xbox Shrek games!<br /><br />In short, please get this movie and enjoy it! It's a pleasure for whole family! Yes, as some reviewers pointed out, there is a handful of minor sexual jokes that could offend some adults but I think from the many parents with whom I've spoken these will go completely over the children's heads without their losing any interest in the film. Thank goodness for Shrek 2! I know what I'm watching next! GRIN: DreamWorks went much further! The two DVDs offer much more than just the film in both full screen and wide screen.

B00000IMTH|5.0|All of the \\"Rainbow Remasters\\" CDs that I've purchased have been outstanding, from the sound quality to the inner sleeves to the artwork (both on the covers and the discs themselves).  This remaster of my favorite of all the Rainbow albums is no exception, turning a \\"must have\\" rock album into a \\"must keep\\"  and \\"must brag about\\" album!  This masterpiece ranks up there with classics like \\"Are You Experienced,\\" \\"Physical Graffiti,\\" \\"Let it Bleed,\\" and \\"Toys in the Attic\\" in terms of historical significance, consistency from track to track, and sheer rock 'n' roll energy. I'm listening to my copy right now!!!
B00003CWRX|2.0|'The Insider' could have been a much better movie than it actually turned out to be.  One of the main problems with the film is we don't know anything about the Russel Crow's character or his family.  They were poorly developed and that really hurts the movie.  We don't know why Jeff has the emotional problems he has or why his wife seems like she is going to vomit in every other scene.<br /><br />What is also really annoying is how the 'The Insider' was filmed.<br /><br />Do we really need to see extreme close-ups of the characters' faces from five different angles?  What purpose does this type of directing serve?  Al Pacino did a fine job as always, but even he couldn't save this mess.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Identity is a rare type of horror movie. All of the characters relatively avoid stupid actions that would otherwise have them killed off. Also, the film manages to pull off a feeling of suspense fairly well. Our story begins with 10 strangers being holed up in a ratty motel together during a harsh thunderstorm. Among the people there, a limo driver, a washed up actress, a cop escorting a convict convicted of murder, a prostitute, two newlyweds, and a troubled family. The motel is run by a suspicious guy named Larry who is getting a little too involved in everyones businness. All are guests are doing well, save the wife of a troubled stepfather who was hit by a car during the storm. Every ones enjoying their stay, until the movie star shows up in a dryer decapitated. After that incident, some of the guests begin freaking out, particularly the newlyweds who get into a savage fight. Also, the convict has broken loose from his shackles and is wondering around the motel, his location unknown. Now the fun begins, the husband to Ginny is found stabbed, the convict has had a baseball bat shoved down his throat, and all the while noone knows who is going to die next. That's part of the fun though, trying to unravel the mystery, and discover the killer. However, my major gripe with this movie is that the character of Ginny is extremely annoying, and to tell you the truth, I couldn't be happier when I witnessed her death. The ending was actually pretty good. When you first find out the twist, you'll probably think it's pretty weak, but believe me, it gets way better. <br /> <br />Rated R: strong violence, gore, language <br />Body Count: 11 <br />Best Death: Baseball bat shoved down throat, or decapitation
B00005JL96|5.0|In my opinion, Lilo & Stitch is one of Disney's better recent releases.  My three-year-old son absolutely loves it.  So much so that we managed to wear out our first DVD and had to buy a second one.  The story is fresh and funny and the characters are quite loveable, despite the fact that many of them are aliens!  I think I've seen (or heard) this movie so many times that I have most of the dialogue memorized.  That said, it still remains to be funny each time it's played so it has to be good, right?  I would recommend this DVD for children of any age.
0375408282|5.0|THE READER BY BERNARD SCHLINK <br /> <br /> In THE READER, German author, Bernard Schlink, offers us an intriguing situation.  Told in the first person, it is about a fifteen-year-old German boy, sick with hepatitus, who, to his great shame, vomits on the street one day and is helped home by a stranger, a woman.  He would have forgotten about her except that his mother insists he thank the stranger and buy her flowers with his allowance.  I smile to think that a young boy today would, in all probability, protest and tell his mother: No way, Jose!  But, being German, he obeys her and this seemingly insignificant incident changes his life.  <br /> After he has delivered his flowers, he has no intention of seeing her again.  And yet, a week later he finds himself standing in front of her door.  Schlink writes: \\"Often in my life I have done things I had not decided to do.\\"  He explains that his behavior is often the opposite of what he had intended as though his behavior is quite independent of his thoughts.  I too am German-born and although Germans are sometimes known for being excessively rational (and efficient), I too, have found myself doing the very opposite of what I originally intended do. <br /> The love story begins with a sensitive rendering of the young boy's sexuality being awakened.  Our young narrator is fifteen when he meets Frau Schmitz (whom he will soon call Hanna), a woman more than twice his age with whom he begins an almost obsessive relationship.  Hanna is a streetcar conductor, a taciturn woman who possesses a mysterious beauty that captivates her young admirer.  She is often surly and coldly monosyllabic,  given to sudden bursts of temper but her young friend continues to spend his afternoons with her.  In spite of their difference in ages, a bond springs up between them that I find entirely believable.  I can feel how much she loves her young visitor even as she pushes him away with her coldness.  He arrives at her apartment straight from school and tells her what he is reading in his English class.  She asks him to read to her and this becomes a ritual she loves and they engage in every afternoon.   <br /> This unique story, beautifully translated from the German, illustrates the universal need for love and how, in our fear of rejection, we tend to sabotage our chances of finding it.  Schlink is saying: we want to be loved for ourselves but are afraid to be ourselves.  Hanna harbors a secret out of a deep shame and embarrassment over what she feels are her inadequacies.   As our young man's feelings for Hanna eventually diminish, he also is less than honest with her and will also pay a price for this in the years to come.  This story feels absolutely true to me and, especially because of its first person narrative, may well be a personal story taken from the author's own life.   <br />  Many years later, our young protagonist, now an adult, is preparing to become an attorney.  In a courtroom where he is studying the outcome of a trial dealing with perpetrators of the concentration camps in World War II, to his great surprise, he sees Hanna again.  The story now becomes an ever-deepening drama that poses a compelling moral and psychological dilemma.  More than this I can not say without giving too much away.  Suffice it to say that I became deeply involved in the fate of the two main characters, Hanna and her once-boyish lover.   <br /> I work in the field of mental health and it is my belief that the human conflicts that drive this story pertain to all  of us whether healthy (if there is such a thing) or mentally ill: We all live with varying degrees of shame and low self-esteem, with feelings of inadequacy which prevent us from speaking honestly to those we love, and thus find outselves in relationships that break apart.  Like the characters in this story, we all have a deep-seated need for love, a need to find a place for ourselves in the lives of those we love, to feel that we belong; and yet our inability to reveal our true natures all too often destroys the very connections we most cherish, leading to heartbreaking loneliness.   <br /> Our narrator, turned lawyer, writes that his memories of Hanna never leave him.  He did marry, he tells us, but the marriage led to divorce.  Furthermore, he confesses that all his relationships with women are hampered by his constantly recurring and poignant memories of Hanna.   <br /> THE READER is a book I read again and again and and each time am drawn into the heartrending destinies of this ill-fated couple.  I enthusiastically recommend it to all who are intrigued, as I am, with the ever complex and emotional affairs of the heart. #
B000000I3O|3.0|Going out on a limb, I'd say every song on this compilation is amazing. But its still a compilation. If you've just discovered the Misfits, this (along with Collection II) is a good pickup, otherwise, buy \\"Walk Among Us,\\" \\"Earth A.D.,\\" \\"Static Age,\\" and \\"Legacy of Brutality.\\"
B000244EMO|5.0|I remember watching this movie in 1987 (when I was 12) and just saying, \\"Wow\\". Arnold was \\"the man\\" back in the 80's and it had a terrific cast of characters. And of course, it had the Predator. <br /> <br />Watching this movie just makes me kind of miss the 80's. Back then you had movies where testosterone was running so high on screen that it just made you feel invincible. While I have had a few female friends that enjoy Predator, it's a typical guy movie. The plot is about as simple as it gets. An elite U.S. marine force goes into the jungle to find and rescue a lost group of soldiers. Upon finding the skinned bodies of the missing, they start getting picked off one-by-one by a mysterious enemy who is hunting them. After awhile they figure out that what is taking them out isn't human and it's up to Arnold to do his thing. <br /> <br />The thing I love about this movie is that it doesn't pull any punches as far as what it's trying to do. You send in big, strong tough guys to use big guns to find other soldiers & fight an alien (The Predator). Every character in the film is interesting and has their own little style. One character has big glasses and tells sick jokes. One is a big-ass indian who is the trail guide, of sorts. One is a very dark-skinned black guy who is just a bit off. Then you get to Jesse Ventura's \\"Painless\\". The gatling gun he used in this movie has now become legend and still impressive to this day. Just seeing Ventura in the movie at all is quite amusing, but he plays the role very well. Arnold is actually better here than I have seen him in most of his action films. He doesn't have to carry the movie on his back and he seems to enjoy that. His fellow cast of characters spout off so many good, tough guy lines that he doesn't have to do it all himself. <br /> <br />And I haven't even mentioned the namesake of the movie yet really. The Predator is a fierce and incredible hunter. By now most of you know about the alien and it's weapons and what itcan do. I must give a huge nod to Stan Winston for maybe saving this movie by creating an incredible Predator. If you watch the special features, you will be shocked at what the first Predator actually looked like. On top of that, Jean-Claude Van Damme was supposed to be inside the suit. Ugh. Guess they dodged a bullet there, eh? <br /> <br />Predator wasn't meant to win any acadamy awards or tug at your heart-strings, etc. It's a fun, big guns, blow crap up, fight bad-ass alien, testosterone filled flick. This is Arnold at his best and this spawned the directorial career of John McTiernan (Die Hard). This movie is so enjoyable to watch that I have seen it more times than I can count. Go get this nice special edition as soon as you can. <br /> <br />Special Features: Well, at least we finally get a special edition of this great movie. The supplements that are here, however, are pretty good but not great. There is a documentary on the making of the film, which is pretty decent. Most of the interviews and footage is from 1987 when the movie was made. I would've liked to see some newer stuff, but I won't complain. There are seven behind-the-scenes featurettes that delve into different aspects of the film. They are each kinda short, but are informative. There are outtakes, a deleted scene (which wasn't very good) and other various little features. Not a bad edition, but I was expecting a little bit more.
B000000H42|5.0|Before hearing Mercyful Fate, I had heard stories of King Diamond's voice. I expected King's voice to be an acquired taste, but to my surprise, from the first time I heard \\"A Dangerous Meeting\\" to the last time I heard \\"Death Kiss\\" (which was like an hour ago) I have loved this album. Every song is an instant metal classic. In my opinion, it overshadows its counterpart \\"Melissa.\\" Not only a must-have for every metal fan, but a must have for every open-minded music listener.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Making a remake of an older film is not an easy task. You don't want to just rehash everything from the original, but you don't want to spit in the face of it either. I think this is a very good remake and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Like other reviews have said, it is very predictable and at some points you have to leave your brain at the door. But when I go to a movie, I am mostly concerned about one thing.....is the movie entertaining enough to justify the money I am paying to see it? In that way, this flick definately delivers. <br /> <br />The story is about a group of thieves who steal a bunch of gold and one of the guys in the group double crosses the rest and leaves them for dead. Years later, they find the traitor and aim at stealing the gold back from him.  <br /> <br />Obviously this is not a complicated plot. The story itself isn't deep and overly engaging, but it just keeps you interested enough to like all the characters in the film. The movie is cast very well. Mark Wahlberg plays the lead actor and he is pretty good. It is impressive to see how far he has come since his early days of acting. Not that he is the next DeNiro, but I am at least happy he got rid of that \\"hip-hop\\" accent of his. Charlize Theron is also quite good. Sure she is mostly here for the eye candy and this role doesn't make her flex her acting muscles much, but I enjoyed her in the role. <br /> <br />Edward Norton (who is one of my two favorite actors of this generation. Johnny Depp being the other) plays the baguy here. Don't worry I am not ruining any plotlines for you by telling you that. Just watch the trailer and you would figure it out. I do like him as the villain here and I wish I could see him in more of these roles. He doesn't play it over the top, and he definately gets you to dislike his character. Donald Sutherland is underused here, but good as usual. The rest of the characters are here for humor and some other great moments. Mos Def, Seth Green, and one of my favorites, Jason Statham play their roles perfectly and provide most of the levity in the film. Overall the acting was quite good. <br /> <br />Basically this movie isn't going to win any awards, but it's a great \\"sit on the couch and entertain me\\" movie. I like how it was shot. The music was good. The acting was great. F. Gary Gray did a good job directing it. The writing was slick. It's just a good, but not great movie. Just don't go into it expecting to see a rehash of the original film. You will not get what you expected, for better or worse. <br /> <br />Special Features: There is plenty to like in the special features as well. There is a making of documentary. It's not as bad as most \\"everyone kisses everyone else's butt\\" type of featurette and is watchable. A little featurette showing the actors learning to drive the Mini's was entertaining. There is also a featurette just on the Mini's themselves. 6 deleted scenes, the trailer, and a featurette about the stunts in the film round out the package.
B000000JO3|5.0|Noted influences of artists ranging from Bad Religion to Pennywise to Silverchair to Rage Against the Machine, Minor Threat revolutionized an ideology and lifestyle through their music. Straight-edge, a term meaning sober lifestyle, was coined on this album. But really, who cares about cigarettes and beer? The fact is this band wrote some of the greatest punk rock music in history.
B00064MW6A|5.0|Racists and purist geeks managed to badmouth the movie before production had even started. Critics jumped on the badwagon naturally(isn't it cute that most of them payed more attention to the costume and the lack of comicbook continuity than the actual movie? LOL!). The truth however is that CATWOMAN is a solid superhero movie, much better than any HULK, X-MEN1 or even SPIDERMAN2(which dissapointed many fans)!
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|ok after listening to this cd and reading the lyrics, i dont see ANY thing about Billie Joe saying he wants to cut up his wife or anything about an antigraveyard.  I dont even think an anti graveyard is something which proves that fiftybucks is an idiot and he doesnt know good music.  If you dont like the music, fiftybucks, dont listen to it and get a life and find something to but moan about good music that you think is bad. so shut your mouth and get out of your parents house and get a job.
B00030590I|4.0|Director Zhang Yimou again demonstrates his extravagant cinematic vision with an entertaining and upmarket kung fu film. A nameless man arrives at the mighty Emperor Qin's palace with three weapons, each belonging to a fallen  assassin. He begins to tell the story of how he met and dispatched  the three assassins, sky, snow and broken sword. The story is really only a pretext for some of the most visually arresting scenes and some elegant sword and martial arts.<br /><br />But Yimou takes the whole genre to a new level with a Rashomon retelling of the story until the truth is revealed. Be prepared for some of the most visually stylistic sequences you will ever see. The fight on the lake alone takes this film to another level.<br /><br />On the political level, there are some interesting ideas about means and ends, and the use or abuse of power. Not sure I agree with it at the end, but I enjoyed the film.
0141439661|4.0|Sense and Sensibility is a book that describes the adventures of falling in love in the 19th century. Love back then wasn't as simple a thing as falling in love today is. Women and men had to abide by the rules their society presented- marrying based on money and status- as the main characters of this book had to do.<br /><br />The book follows sisters Elinor Dashwood, a sensible young woman who does not let her emotions rule her behavior, and Marianne Dashwood, a person who exaggerates and acts on her many emotions constantly. Their journey starts off when their father dies and they are forced to move out to the country to live on a very small allowance. At their new home, they meet a numerous amount of people who turn their life into a whirlwind. Willoughby, a suave and prominent young man, steals the attention of Marianne and an old love of Elinor's returns. Both of these relationships turn out differently than anyone can expect, through many twists and turns.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book that holds your attention through the end. The beginning pages that describe different relations, deaths, and monetary concerns were difficult to follow, as well as some of the different situations throughout the book. But Jane Austins ability to portray the hardships, and results, that both of these sisters had to endure, through different situations of love in the unruly 19th century, was without compare.
B00004Z459|1.0|To say that this \\"band\\" doesn't even deserve one star is an understatement. It is quite sad what this country has come to. It is quite obvious that receiving a record contract does not require musicians anymore. I am appalled by the fact that anyone would call these incompetent fools musical geniuses. That is simply a crime to the world of music. I only reviewed this cd because I have a good laugh reading its other reviews. And to those of you who credit this \\"band\\" for thier mockery of a musical compostiton; you have a lot to learn.
0340822775|3.0|Mitchell's contrivance in Cloud Atlas has occasional moments of inspiration, generated by an undoubted talent, but the heavy construction and novella-device serves only to cover up the inadequacies in the storytelling.  The breadth and range of the storytelling is in itself too broad, too ambitious; in presenting a broad vision, the detail is lost, the reader's ownership of the penned emotion is lost.  The story of Cloud Atlas is the mathematical, musical constructs, which are impressive and meticulous.  The book has a marvellous rhythm, its movement in time and place and the ultimate coalescence of the interwoven storylines, gives the book both a finality and a certain immortality, in that one senses in part the circular motion of Joyce's Finnegan's Wake.  Let me be clear, however, the the comparison with Joyce terminates there.   <br /> <br />Mitchell is a fine technician, a wonderful practicioner, and a truly talented writer.  If he had thought a little more about the stories he was telling, and less about the 'grand message' of global catastrophe, if he gave a little more effort to character development and less to the sytlistic vagaries of the book, it could have been a great book.  Not quite the Booker, but could have been.
B000001EC1|5.0|I bought Cross Road because I'd heard some of the songs when my brothers played them and knew \\"Bed of Roses\\" from school dances.  I never expected to love the CD as much as I did--this was the first CD case I ever wore the hinge down on so that it didn't stop opening at 180 degrees.<br /><br />Granted, the album didn't have every single pre-1994 Bon Jovi hit on it, but I don't think that means that the casual listener or even the hardcore Bon Jovi fan can't enjoy listening.  There's a great selection of songs here.
B00000AOUD|5.0|After the transitional and daring \\"Aqualung\\" album turned Jethro Tull into hard rock heroes and stadium giants, the group made one of the gutsiest moves they could; their next album, 1972's \\"Thick As a Brick\\" consisted of a single, LP-length song, full of winding structures and movements, at just around 44 minutes long. Of course in those days one would have to get up and flip the vinyl record over to hear the whole thing, but CD technology allows us to hear the entire song uninterrupted. \\"Thick As a Brick\\" stands as one of progressive rock's defining milestones, a brave gamble that took as much guts as The Who's rock opera \\"Tommy,\\" or Pink Floyd's \\"Wall\\" concerts where an actual giant wall was constructed around them, or Yes member Rick Wakeman making a solo career highlight when he performed his \\"King Arthur\\" show on ice at Wembley's Empire Pool (though it cost him a pretty penny to set up the stunt).<br /><br />Everything about the album is innovative, or at the least a wild idea, from the music right down to the album cover; it featured a batch of made-up news stories, the front page story depicting a young boy's epic poem (titled of course \\"Thick As a Brick\\") being disqualified from a literary contest because of its author's unfair advantage over the other entries due to his high intellect, and for other nonsensical reasons. And certainly it would be a marvel of music and science if any young child-or any 30 year old modern musician for that matter-could manage to come up with the lyrics Ian Anderson penned for this epic. At first listen they seem to tell one story, but the next listen will have the listener toying with another idea, until they're starving to know what they mean. The music would confound even the most rebellious of 19th century classical composers, going through a color-bending and challenging obstacle course of structures and bridges, many of which so strong that Tull could have sculpted entire songs out of them.<br /><br />The album is a masterpiece, from the opening gentle acoustic lines, through the boisterous, animated 40-minute marathon, and concluding with Anderson's quivery emotional reading of, \\"Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick...as a brick.\\"rom the opening gentle acoustic lines, through the boisterous, animated 40-minute marathon, and concluding with Anderson's quivery emotional reading of, \\"Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick...as a brick.\\" <br />
B000002G26|5.0|I discovered So Far So Good when I went looking for a CD single of \\"Please Forgive Me\\" so I could play it at a party.  The only copy of \\"Please Forgive Me\\" in the store, though, was to be found on So Far So Good--which was only available on cassette.<br /><br />I bought the tape and came to really like it.  Somehow it feels like there are 20 tracks here instead of 14--you get your money's worth out of this album, even if diehard Bryan Adams fans can't find ALL the tracks they want.  Eventually, I upgraded to the CD and gave my mom the tape.  I've listened to the music with quite a few people, and everyone seems to enjoy singing along.
B000002P2W|5.0|Listeners have long touted \\"The Who By Numbers\\" as the hard rock group's most personal set of songs, exposing in stark fashion personal fears, insecurities, and loves. While this may be true, such personal and desperate themes had been appearing in Who songs long before this set, only they were disguised by complex concept albums and rock operas (like \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\") If one looks back at the Who's catalog, they will find that Pete Townshend was often as honest and gritty as he would later be on his solo works; for example `Behind Blue Eyes' (from \\"Who's Next\\") began as a prayer that the guitarist was putting to music, and others like `Bargain' had equally stark spiritual messages. Or take the complicated concept album \\"Quadrophenia\\"-songs like `The Real Me' and `I'm One' poignantly express Townshend's trademark angst, and the angst of the entire Who for that matter. But again, tied up inside the storyline of \\"Quadrophenia,\\" it was easy to forget that the band's music was more autobiographical than it seemed.<br /><br />1975's \\"The Who By Numbers\\" was an eruption of personal demons, bold confessions, and realistic portrayals. John Swenson's liner notes do the best job at describing it; \\"The album does not attempt to approximate the band's live sound, invent a new way to approach rock and roll or advance a world view.\\" Instead, the album has no concept, no storyline, no cast of characters and plot twists. It is a journal that is difficult to read but once you've read it you'll leave with the experience of looking into someone else's soul. Townshend's songs are un-apologetic, and The Who are uncompromising in neither the spontaneous bursts (`Slip Kid,' `Success Story,' `In a Hand or a Face') nor the minimalistic refrains (`Imagine a Man,' `They Are All in Love') that the album consists of. Some of the song arrangements caught fans off guard, like the elegant `They Are All in Love,' but they all worked. Perhaps the musician that comes off most impressive here is Roger Daltrey; his voice tackles both the trademark throaty roar but at the same time is able to sing higher more elegant parts as if it's nothing more than shooting the breeze. On `How Many Friends' he sings the verses with graceful sincerity and on the choruses he breaks into a roar, desperately snarling \\"How many friends have I really got? You can count `em on one hand...\\" The gut-wrenching but somehow attractive `Imagine a Man' also features one of Daltrey's biggest challenges vocal-wise, but he pulls it off. Townshend sings on the album as well, such as on the poignant and lyrically gritty `However Much I Booze' and the album's most unexpectedly beautiful tune `Blue, Red, and Grey,' a childlike confession of the world's beauty featuring only Townshend, a ukulele and a small backing brass arrangement. But completely opposite of course are the rockers, most notably the opener `Slip Kid,' featuring some far out percussion from Keith Moon who had it rough on the album, having to restrain his wild playing at many points. `Success Story' is the best rocker though, bassist John Entwistle's cynical biography of the group.<br /><br />Perhaps the satisfaction of personal expression displayed on this album was more influential on what was to come from The Who than anyone expected; their remaining three albums, \\"Who Are You,\\" \\"Face Dances,\\" \\"It's Hard,\\" were all full of inner expression, from getting over the frustrations of the past to insecurities in growing older. \\"The Who By Numbers\\" remains one of the most carefully studied of the group's mighty catalog, both for its arching power and honest confession.e is Roger Daltrey; his voice tackles both the trademark throaty roar but at the same time is able to sing higher more elegant parts as if it's nothing more than shooting the breeze.

B0002JJBZE|5.0|the DVD boxes have, in my estimation, been pretty good so far. the only thing that has been bugging me (besides the lack of a deforest kelley close-up in the <rather slapped-together> bonus features) is the screwing around that has been done with the sound effects. the \\"rocket\\" noises dubbed in to the enterprise fly-bys were NOT on the original episodes past the mid-first season (i think 'arena' or 'the alternative factor' was the last episode to feature them in the 'real' version), and the bridge sound effects have clearly been redubbed from the star trek sound effects CD...you can just sort of tell b/c there are \\"what i can only call \\"first-season\\" sound effects in much later episodes....i mean, this is VERY minor stuff, and nothing that anyone who hadn't these episodes hundreds of times wouldn't notice, but still...i HAVE seen these episodes hundreds of times, and i DID notice ;)    otherwise, this is a fantastic set. as far as the quality of the episodes themselves, you just can't get any better than this. \\"classic\\" is an overused term these days, but if stuff like \\"mirror mirror,\\" \\"amok time,\\" \\"journey to babel,\\" \\"a piece of the action,\\" and \\"the trouble with tribbles\\" doesn't qualify as classic, nothing does.    one great thing about the second season is the breadth of style displayed not only by the cast, but by the writers. there's straight-up action/adventure this season (\\"the doomsday machine\\"), more subtle, gentle character pieces (\\"metamorphosis\\"), topical drama (\\"a private little war\\"), some really fun b-grade SF material (\\"the deadly years,\\" \\"the gamesters of triskelion\\") and flat-out comedy (\\"the trouble with tribbles,\\" \\"a piece of the action,\\" \\"i mudd\\"). i really think that it was the second season of the original series that best displayed the broad range of possibilities inherent in roddenberry's original series premise. every time i read some clueless critic complaining about star trek being \\"stiff\\" or \\"humorless\\" or how it takes itself too seriously, i think of this season and the incredibly broad spectrum of adventure and fun.     and the chemistry between the cast - particularly shatner, nimoy, and kelley - is something that no subsequent trek series has ever come close to matching.    as far as trek goes, the is the real thing.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Perhaps Wong Kar-wai's international attention has diminished viewers' perception of this sumptuous film. Like a star that outshines other nearby stars, people soon forget its intricacies and the wonder and nature of its possible existence.  <br /> <br />\\"In the Mood for Love\\" is like that intricately woven web of vapours, energies and intensities which shape and form that delicate but volatile atmostphere of a star, or \\"mood\\" in the film. It is what rises up to the surface, although our perception of which nonetheless mutates with each subsequent viewing. To say that Wong's films do not have a plot is not entirely true and sounds to me as a repeat of the often heard soundbytes from other viewers/reviewers. The thing is, Wong makes visible what other directors would rather not show, Wong's vision is that of an alternative version of the same story. And one that is told through images, colour, light, music, movement. <br /> <br />So, one may say that this is a story about Mrs Chow and Mr Chan's affair - the respective spouses of Tony Leung's and Maggie Cheung's characters - it is an affair which we (as audiences) do not and cannot identify with, as these characters are virtually nameless and faceless in the entire film.  <br /> <br />So too, the characters that we do see in the film - Mr Chow and Mrs Chan - refuses to identify with this affair. But for them, try as they might to keep reality at bay, they are, nonetheless,  entangling and ensnaring themselves into a labrythine web that they themselves have spun -- by play-acting and role-swapping -- they have discovered their own yearning and desire/love for each other. <br /> <br />Like the four chambers of the heart - love, deceit, self-deception and desire circulate. But like a heart that has closed-in on itself, it is claustrophobic, suffocating and barely alive. <br /> <br />The movement and rhythm of the film is like that slow-waltz (the main theme of the film - Yumei's theme) and the ravishing cinematography -so close is that camera movement to that of Hou Hsiao-hsien's film \\"Flowers of Shanghai\\" (shot by the same DOP, Mark Lee Bing) that one is hypnotically absorbed into the fabric of the film, its colours, the texture and density of the images. Wong is building layer upon layer of memories, fictional and real, combining his own childhood memories of the 60's in Hong Kong to imagined memories that could only have come from a distant future - year 2000 of contemporary HK.  <br /> <br />When you watch this film, please allow yourself the luxury of time, after all, Wong did take 18 months to make it. And Maggie said in a Chinese interview that without this time, she would not have been able to play Mrs Chan as she did, \\"when my nails are painted a certain shade of pink, and my hair and makeup is done, my hands automatically place themselves in a certain way...\\" I think this says much about the truth Wong translates on screen -- that it exists because of his patience with time. So, I guess it'll be nice to do him the same courtesy and make time to see this film - and let its mood absorb you for a while. <br />
B0000DJZA5|5.0|\\"Let it Be...Naked\\" is the 2003 re-release of the Beatles 1970 original. It's not a whole lot different..a couple songs are dumped (\\"Dig It\\", \\"Maggie Mae\\"), one is added (\\"Don't Let Me Down\\"), new track order. The main difference is that the Phil Spector over-production on tracks like \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" is gone.    The former works much better with the more stripped down song. Spector's syrupy strings and cheesy choral effects are gone; as a result, the song feels like it can breathe a lot easier without being buried in all that.     The latter is also better, although not as dramatic of a change.     Most of the other songs like \\"Get Back\\", \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", \\"Two Of Us\\", etc. haven't changed much, if at all. Which is fine, because they didn't need to be changed.    Due to the immense improvement of \\"..Road\\" and to a lesser extent, \\"Across the Universe\\", I would consider \\"Naked\\" an improvement over the original album. However, if you liked Phil Spector's production, don't bother.
0553278398|2.0|There is absolutely no development of the Trilogy concept here, and as such it is only character filler and not that coherent as a novel.  Asimov knew what would sell, and he wrote some great stuff, but to be honest I thing he wrote WAY too much.  THis is too much.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I've always been a big Green Day fan and I was very excited to hear American Idiot. I wasn't really sure what expect of it concitering Warning wasn't there best. The day American Idiot came out I went out to buy it. I have listened to the CD everyday since the day I got it. I have never heard anything as deep and meaning as American Idiot. It is really pointed to a certan crowd though. The under-rated, unloved, fighting through life, trying to find themselfs teen group (punk). I think everyone can love this album but not everyone will fully understand it.
B00000IFP6|5.0|This rendition of Beethoven has so much energy, you'd swear it was speed metal. Rock on!
B00004XPPE|5.0|I was initially annoyed that this film is in b&w. Judging by the slip-jacket art, one would believe this film to be in color. I was initially annoyed that this film seemed like it would be just another computer gone berserk tale. Judging by the description on the back of the box, one would believe this film would be more sophisticated than that. Saints be. In b&w it should, and sophisticated it is.  The two world leaders have a problem: an American accident, and a Soviet accident, have put into motion a series of events that can only end in Armagedon unless they think of something fast. A Soviet radio jamming device, leads an American Bomber Squad to believe they are to Nuke Moscow. Nobody can make them stop. When Moscow is destroyed, how should thier leadership respond? 'Accidents will happen'. If we kill 5 million Soviets, and contaminate hundreds of thier square miles for thousands of years, how should we apologize? How can we level the playing field? Moscow is thier greatest city. We've accidently destroyed it. Why should they believe it was an accident? What about our greatest city......?
B00005QIPH|5.0|I bought this on the strength of one song (Last Nite) and at first I was disappointed - I only liked about 5 out of the 11 tracks. But I stuck with it and now it's my favourite album of all time! I love... EVERYTHING about it and every time I listen to it it gets better and I love it more.  <br /> <br />I don't know if it rewrites the music scene or whatever and I really don't care. I'd recommend this to anyone who actually likes music. Honestly, I don't normally write such gushy reviews but I'm making an exception for this!
B00006GA48|2.0|Tinny and hard to digest, the lone worthy track , ( I'm Getting ) Closer to my Home, is cool enough for me to give it 2 stars. It's a dreamy song with special sounds like water splashing. If it wasn't so hollow, and the production values better, it would probably be a song still heard on radio and TV. Otherwise, not much else here.
B0000683DH|4.0|If ever you've doubted that revenge is a good thing, then you should study this film carefully. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. You'll note the TLC that goes into forming this cluster of hatred and vengeance. The diabolical plans that man can conceive of. The timing, deceit, and trickery that define humanity; and the (nearly) flawless execution of evil.  I'm so proud of us all.Khan, a super-human genetic mutant, and his ragtag crew, are apparently abandoned on a desolate planet by Captain James T. Kirk. At the time a thriving planet, full of life, this \\"abandonment\\" actually offered Khan a chance at redemption; and finally realize that slipped opportunity to cultivate the society Khan had envisioned. A cataclysmic event renders the planet nearly unihabitable. Khan's wife dies. Kirk fails to check on Khan's progress as he had promised he would. Eventually Starfleet returns to the system in search of a dead planet onwhere to test \\"The Genisis Project\\"; a project believed to form instant life where there is none.Seizing upon this chance opportunity to escape desolate conditions, and, square things with Captain Kirk (now an Admiral), Khan lures the Admiral to his wasteland where Khan's plans for revenge seems to be in perfect form. \\"Revenge is a dish best served cold\\". An oversight by Khan and his crew gives Kirk the opening he needs, to turn the tide and destroy Khan. Does Kirk's plan fail too? You decide. A tragic event gives Kirk pause. What he won, was it worth what he lost? Exciting, nicely ponderous, and visually stunning.
B000009HF2|2.0|I just can't imagine listening to it again. I could swear I hear some yodeling in the background. He sure does know his ukelele though. OK, OK, the xylophone stuff is pretty good. The spoons and bells are alright too. I just think it's prententious and arrogant. The banjo doesn't even work! Oh, and that harpsicord! Just awful! It sounds like he has one of those vibrating things for his throat. I geuss it has it's moments - but not vary many of them.
B000066F6H|1.0|Caution: The Hives Are Not As Advertised! We all heard this was Talking Heads meets Elvis Costello and The Sex Pistols. Nyet. It's noisy, uneven, and offers nothing of substance, lyrically, or musically. There's no redeeming value. The only cut half-way worth hearing is \\"Find Another Girl\\". They should be so lucky! Save your money, save yourself; do not approach The Hives.
B0000X61UU|5.0|An excellent athletic workout. A complete and challenging workout.  I have used this workout during the winter months when I am not able to run and it prepares me for my first 5-K when the warm weather returns. I love the energy and the variety of this workout.  I am not a very coordinated person and I hate aerobic workouts with all sort of dance steps therefore I am in love with this athletic workout.  My VHS tape is in bad shape and I am so glad the DVD version is out. <br /> <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's \\"Still Not Getting Any\\" deserves 5 stars and then some. Their new cd ROCKS, plan and simple, it just ROCKS!!! You need to get a copy of it because it is just freakin' amazing. Not to mention the fact that you get a free dvd with it. How much more awesome can it get? The songs are brilliant. You would have to be insane not to go out and get SNGA!!!!!!! I can't really say much more then SNGA ROCKS BIG TIME!!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br />~April Pfister
B00063MBU8|5.0|OMG!! Simple Plan is back and better than ever!! This is cd truly rocks!! Its totally different from topics Simple Plan has done before but it brings out a different part of them that wasnt seen previously. Their first release off this album entitled \\"Welcome to my life\\" talks about people's problems in life and how they truly feel and look at the world; it also talks about how others can never know your pain but your never alone. This cd is indeed very deep and thoughtful and i think that there is atleast one song that someone can relate to. Songs such as \\"Untitled\\" & \\"Everytime\\" are in my opinion the best songs on this cd because the words are just so powerful and meaningful and after listening to youll have a sense of feeling that everything will truly be ok. Another good aspect of this cd is that one side is a dvd with  coverage of stuff about the band, lyrics to all songs and also pictures!! I think that by far this is the BEST CD EVER!! And any one who hasnt gotten it yet, should stop reading this and go get it!!SIMPLE PLAN KICKS ASS AND THIS CD ROCKS!! GO GET IT NOW!! TRUST ME, YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!=)
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore is a great American and a good Democrat. He really opened my eyes to how disturbing the war on Iraq is. I like the way it starts out cause it brings back memories of the 2000 election. I really think the threat to America was overlooked before it happened and the first several months George W. Bush was kind of a slacker president. He read My Pet Goat for 7 mintues before telling the class what happened on September 11. The war in Afghanistan ended up not being as big as the war in Iraq which to me is pretty strange because for me the reason the trade center was attacked was because of Osama Bin Laden and his cronies sending their warped believers off on a plane.Footage of the war and certain people's sick attitude about it were very disturbing. Its emotionally moving and will make you cry at times. Bush may have been reelected but I do not believe he is one of our better presidents that we have had.Next election vote Democratic.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|So said Leonard Maltin of THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS and he's absolutely right.<br /><br />Despite the slapstick, despite the drunken, lecherous vampire still trying to seduce his young maid, despite the flamboyantly gay vampire chasing Polanski in a powder-blue night shirt, FEARLESS is still a horror movie in story and atmosphere.  The photography, the sets, the pacing, the creepy music--it would play as one of the better Hammer films if played straight!<br /><br />I remember loving this movie as a horror movie fan growing up in the 70's, but the sad realization that Sharon Tate--who's so hot, it's almost supernatural--meeting the real-life Manson monsters a couple years after this film cast a very dark shadow over the production.<br /><br />For trivia nuts, look for these actors:<br />Jack McGowan, who plays the Professor, went on to appear in START THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME and then, finally, THE EXORCIST.<br />Fiona Lewis, the blonde maid, went on to become another total knock-out (as a redhead) in a Dr. Phibes film and other appearances in the 70's.<br />And look fast for Ronald Lacey: he plays the Village Idiot here but went on, years later, to play the Nazi with the medallion burned into his palm in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.<br /><br />The only other movie I can think of that successfully blended both humor and horror was 1981's AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.<br />(Skip the \\"Vintage\\" extra, \\"Vampires 101\\": it's beyond lame).
B0000931QR|5.0|I personally don't like bands because most bands sing noisy songs. But La oreja de Van Gogh is different, I heard their song &quot;Rosa&quot; from a Latin TV show and I become to notice them. Later on I bought this CD from Amazon.ca. You know what, I was sooo nervous that there's only one good song in this album. Thanks god... this album didn't dissapoint me!!! This album is really wonderful and they are a little bit rock songs but they don't sound noisy. I found the lady who sings in La oreja de Van Gogh got an excellent voice~
B000060P79|4.0|I'll admit, I was hesitant when my friend loaned me her copy of \\"No Helmet, No Pads... Just Balls.\\" Being a fan of The Ramones, Sex Pistols, Pink Floyd and other more time-tested bands, Simple Plan just really didn't fit in anywhere.  <br />     <br />When I heard the first strings of \\"I'd Do Anything,\\" though, I was ready to just get up and dance. The music was upbeat and, no matter how depressing the lyrics were, it just made me want to dance. <br /> <br />\\"No Hemet, No Pads... Just Balls\\" is now one of my favourite cds. It's a cd I can listen to all the way through without having to skip one single track. I'd recommend this cd to all of my friends in a heartbeat.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I don't buy a lot of CD's but this one was speicial, It's a Cd i can always turn to when im having a bad day, it's awesome, Best Punk/Pop Album of the year!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD is great, and the DVD is awesome too!  Unlike alot of other CD's on the market, EVERY song on this CD is awesome. It's full of upbeat, make you wanna jump tunes, and then topped off by the incredible ballad \\"Untitled\\".  Yet another FANTASTIC release by the boys of Simple Plan. If you don't already have it, either go get it or put it on your Christmas list. It's a definate MUST have!!!!
B0000024IE|5.0|Okay, it's 14 years old and in some ways dated (it depends on the song, but others are just as relevant), but it still has infinitely more merit than any spoon-fed rubbish Britney Spears or any of the other modern manufactured images would ever begin to provide. <br /> <br />The music itself is not just rap.  Not just rock.  Not just R&B.  Not just trance/dance.  It's all of them melded together with something original thrown in.  And not just melded, there is a deep structure present that many artists have been unable to duplicate.  This not only evolutionized the music world at the time, it utterly revolutionized it.  And today it remains just as fresh and powerful.  Even if you're not fond of the messages, the music itself is revolutionary - and considering the glam rock heavy metal trash of the late 80s and the capitalized so-called 'alternative' rock of the early 90s, PE's (then) new style was the most refreshing and truly energetic style of the time and still holds its own today.   <br /> <br />The lyrics in music are supposed to tell a message.  The typical music genres that have people singing for old lovers, dead dogs, or dead dogs that were their lovers or still are (see Country) generally have me reaching the Power button faster than you can say \\"crap\\".  PE is different, and one of the few voices in latter-day history to have the guts to speak their minds in our spoon-fed mentally-comatose society.  PE holds nothing back and sing in just with powerful lyrics with one the most inventive musical styles ever made.  \\"Fear\\" is one of their best albums, with '911 is a Joke', 'Brothers Gonna Work it Out', 'Welcome to the Terrordome', 'Burn Hollywood Burn', 'Fear of a Black Planet', and 'Fight the Power' being the highlights. <br /> <br />Agree or disagree with what they say in their songs, they have a right to say it and they say it well.  And at least they're saying something, which cannot be said for countless scores of other 'groups', too dependent on fleeting fame and greed to take a stand? <br /> <br />I also disagree with the adult content label.  While profanity is used, it's used in a way to convey the intended emotion - there is purpose in the use of the word, it is not there just to mindlessly shock mommy and daddy into a coma.  To me, it is justified and relevant.  If certain religious texts speak of animal sacrifice and human torture and it's not censored one bit, why is the S-word?!
1591840562|4.0|I'm almost finished reading this book, but have found myself using information from it already at work. The chapter on business plans adds a perspective that is valuable and useful. The advice on recruiting employees seems right on and I have used some of Kawasaki's insights in a search that we have in progress at this moment. The writing is fun and functional and Kawasaki makes great use of formatting to make the book easy to digest. <br /> <br />A really cool idea is the cover contest that Kawasaki ran. The runner-up cover designs are included on the inside of the book cover.

0802130208|5.0|Funny, moving, bizarre, fresh, original, with a unique voice of truth. In the tradition of Tristram Shandy, Catch-22 and other great comic novels. So many deep books aren't funny, and so many funny books aren't deep. But when you find both characteristics together in one book, you know you've found something you will never forget. And isn't it telling how the most idiosyncratic character and situations you can imagine are also the most universal? If you want to be deeply refreshed -- not just amused -- read this book.
B0001JXQEM|4.0|When Weezer released the Blue Album back in 1994, Geffen only shipped 13 000 copies because they thought the album wouldn't be a big seller since almost no publicity was made for it. Rivers Cuomo and Matt Sharp even wrote a list of persons who would surely buy the album, and the list came up to more or less a hundred persons. They sold 90 copies in the first week... But after Undone was released as a single, the album sold all the copies that were in shops, and in the end they ended up selling 3 million copies of the album. The Blue Album became a classic, and then years later, here comes this deluxe re-release.<br />A lot of people are not sure wether they should buy it or not. I have to admit that it's really expensive, especially in Canada. At first I decided that I wouldn't buy it, since almost every Deluxe Edition is dissapointing (see the Velvet Underground and Nico...). But a friend gave it to me for my birthday (thanks to him) and I was really surprised by what I saw (and heard). First, the packaging. It's absolutely beautiful. It contains rare and beautiful pictures of the band, which are spread through the packaging itself and inside the 30 pages booklet. The booklet contains pictures of the band, hand-written lyrics to the songs of cd 1 and 2, a story written by Todd Sullivan about how he discovered the band and got them signed and finally detailed notes about all the b-sides featured in the second cd. The only thing that was a bit dissapointing about the booklet is that the pictures are sometimes too small and the lyrics to &quot;I swear it's true&quot; and &quot;Paperface&quot; are missing, for some reason.<br />There is not much to say about the Blue Album. Everyone knows it's a masterpiece. So let's talk about the second cd. It contains b-sides, live tracks, demos and unreleased songs from the Blue Album era. Some of the songs can be found on compilations, soundtracks or from the Internet, but it's nice to have them all on one cd with a slightly better sound quality. Listening to this cd from the beginning to the end seems to give the impression that you understand the Blue Album even better now. It's really, really interesting, and some of the songs are actually really good (see &quot;No one else&quot; acoustic version, &quot;Paperface&quot; and &quot;Mykel and Carli&quot;). The only &quot;bad&quot; thing about the second cd is the original album mix of &quot;Say it ain't so&quot;, which is almost identical to the version we all know. But it's interesting to see the band &quot;stripped down&quot; on the Kitchen Tapes recordings.<br />You should buy this cd. It's really a trip through the musical world of Weezer and it brings you back in 1994 in a very strange way. I know it's expensive, but it totally worths the money. Once again, Weezer as delivered quality material.
B00005OWEG|5.0|First I have to say that this film is not overrated in any way. I write this as a response to those that have said that it is a long drag, and who have fallen asleep. They obviously don't understand landmark film-making.  <br /> <br />This film is a masterpiece. I myself liked the first one also, and think that maybe the extra scenes should've been in a disc as extra features. However if anyone could work them into the story, then that is Coppola.  <br /> <br />The world reknown Godfather trilogy director, here brings us into a psychological battle of the vietnam war. Make no mistake,this film is dark, and it is graphic. However it leaves you with the experience that, illfated individuals, have lived in, and amazingly through.  <br /> <br />I suspect you already have an idea about what the film is about so I will not go into great detail like I did to rescue Godfather III. However the performances from all the actors,and especially Brando, are unforgettable. You should if you enjoy films feel the pain this movie offers, be it for the characters or in a wider sense. <br />  <br />You should watch this however with patience and an open mind. The Redux version is very long but just as good if not better,  <br />since the feeling of the craming of all the scenes can only make you uncomfortable to a small extent.  <br /> <br />I recomend it fully, if you like war films which have meaning and not just mass slaughter, or just films with acting at its best.  <br /> <br />Finally, you should watch both in my opinion and decide for yourself. Both versions are excellent films, and it really is up to the viewer which is best, not which is good.  <br /> <br />(Although i have seen both I own only the Redux version, because when it came down to buying Apocalypse Now on DVD, Redux had just come out, and the curiousity overpowered me, so i took the chance. I have no regrets whatsoever; this is a ladnmark film, and there will not be another that goes into this topic in this manner again.) <br /> <br />Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I apologize for not going into greater detail.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Its a newer sound for a new Simple Plan album. . . and it still ROCKS! The just-have-to-get-up-and-jump-along beats are perfect for their catchy lyrics. The cd has a song for any emotion you can identify with. Not only does the cd have personal meaning, tracks like \\"Crazy\\" deal with society, and problems thereof. The whole cd is pure genius.  <br />Also, the cd has some pretty funky eye candy of the guys (you'll know what I mean). So, If you dont have the new cd, what are you waiting for? Go get it NOW! Its definently worth it.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Everyone this is the best cd I have!!You must get it now let someone borrow it then pass it on so the whole world knows!! It rocks!!! SP rocks!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|On their new CD, \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\", Simple Plan proves that they too can grow up along side their fans. In this new album the lyrics have improved and become less focused on the general teen angst, and the guys have managed to craft songs that their fan base can relate to.  <br /> <br />So it could be said, that Simple Plan's music is growing with their fans. The sound is still essentially the same. Pop-punk. The guys know who they are and what works for them. So repectively, they stay with in that genre and show their new found growth.  <br /> <br />One noticable improvement is Pierre's singing. It's no longer the squeaky pitch, that debuted on \\"No pads, No helmets, just balls.\\" It's grown more richer and smoother. This new found strenght allows him to put more emotion in songs such as \\"Untitled\\" which is an acoustic track. So clearly, the boy has got some singing chops. <br /> <br />Another thing that I enjoyed on this album was the improvement in the instrumental work on all the tracks. Chuck has stepped up his drumming and the hard work pays off. Jeff Stinco's guitar work has set the bar higher now. His guitar playing is simply divine. He wails like a maniac on tracks like, \\"Me Against The World\\" and \\"Promise\\". Clearly, the boy has honed his guitar skills. <br /> <br />Over all this album is great. A wonderful sophmore album from Simple Plan. The songs are great, and continue to bring the honesty and energy that has captivated their fans. So if you are curious to whether or not to buy this album. I say buy it. It's great and the bonus DVD will bring hours of enjoyment as well.  <br /> <br />So. Stop reading this album and buy the album, and see what I'm talking about!
B00005JNEI|3.0|Okay, perhaps I am not exactly qualified to write  a review on such a tender topic as American politics, coming from the land down under, But I have to make a comment. After watching F/911 I got the impression there was fun times had by all in the editing dept. I have seen some of the original interviews with Bush, and there is a lot of missing dialogue! Besides that, Does anyone really think that the masses would vote to keep a man in power for another 4 years who has supposedly lied and misled the people of America? Here in Australia we recently re-elected our leader- Prime Minister John Howard. Again, amid claims of lies and following old G B into war. In my opinion... keep up the good work boys!
B00063MBU8|5.0|omg... i loved the first cd so i was so ready for the second one to come out and to hear what theyve been working on... expectations were high.. and I THINK THEY WERE MET.... the single was good... but SHUT UP... was a great song... i love the cd and the extra bonus dvd was awesome...

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Here are the best things about this movie: <br /> <br />1) Brad Pitt all Buffed up <br /> <br />2) Eric Bana all Buffed up <br /> <br />3) Brad Pitt in a Tunic <br /> <br />4) Eric Bana in a tunic <br /> <br />5) Brad Pitt getting Naked <br /> <br />Everything else is just a special effect.
B0000020C4|5.0|What more can one ask for?  The best cast (esp. Michael Ball and the amazing Lea Salonga), the best performances, the most exciting atmosphere.  As many people have said, get this and the Complete Symphonic Recording and you have ALL the Les Miz you'll ever need!
B000022TSW|5.0|This movie was great. Including Cartman, he's the funniest character i've ever seen on South Park. And he's absolutely right, Kyle's mom is a b****h. She's a bigfat B****H. And, we finally get to see how Kenny talks and looks like. I give this a perfect 5 out of 5.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's New cd Still Not Getting Any is a really good cd. It is Kinda like there older cd no pads no helmets...just balls. the new cd has really awesome songs and on the untilted one it has the lead singer pierre bouvier singing a solo it is sooo good. if you get the one with the dual disc on the other side you will see features on the dvd part which you can stick in a dvd player or you can stick it in your computer if you have a devise in it were you can watch it on. the cd is about like people don't understand you and getting pushed around when you didn't do anything. it is a step higher which means it is better than there other cd but it sounds lil differnt but you no thats simple plan. if you like good charlotte you will like simple plan most likely. Simple Plan is Pierre Bouvier(lead singer) David Desrosiers(bass guitarist and back up vocals) sebastian lefbrve (back up vocals and guitar) chuck comeau (drums) and jeff stinco(guitar) these guys no how to play music really well and the cool part is there from montreal canda!!!&#60;3  <br />and also on the dvd it has lyrics,them talking,mulimedia and more its sweet!!!!!
0465043550|5.0|The fundamental fractal concept applied to the behavior of markets offers most promising insights. This book takes you on the right track because as you may see from Savov's theory of interaction the texture of reality is made of multiscale fractal like 3D-spiral swirls of basic matter that contract and expand, i.e. show ups and downs like everything around us, including prices. Therefore Mandelbrot's fractal eye on the dynamics of the markets has its much deeper justification in the book Theory of Interaction the Simplest Explanation of Everything by Eugene Savov.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|The proper final album for the great Ray would have been one that recognized the sadness of his fading light. <br /> <br />This album did his talent enormous injustice by undermining what his music was all about. <br /> <br />As the other reviewers noted, this album was overproduced in the extreme--to the point of distraction and disservice to Ray's music. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most egregious misundersanding of Ray's talent and music was the Willie Nelson duet, It Was A Very Good Year.  A soft, quiet, low key duet with Willie and Ray would have been perfect.  But the producer, John Burk, went over the top, ruining all the potential with a Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr. type of production.  This was a disgrace, evidencing a fundamental misunderstanding by the producer of the song, the artists and the music. <br /> <br />I could go on and on.  The album is an abomination, spoiled not by the artists but by the idiots who conceptualized it.  Shameful.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plans new CD, Still Not Getting Any..., is one of the best CDs this year. If you liked the old record, you will love this. I think that the band has really grown up in their new record. This music is great to listen to because their songs are about things you can relate to. I think Simple Plan Rocks, so go get their new CD.
B0002DB50E|5.0|David Cronenberg's hallucinatory trip has finally gotten the DVD release it deserves, thanks to the good folks at Criterion.  James Woods, perfectly cast and dripping with sleeze, plays cable TV station operator Max Renn, who accidently intercepts a mysterious satellite feed featuring women apparently being tortured to death.  The source of the feed is connected to a phanatical religious figure and his daughter who are seemingly behind a plot to broadcast subliminal signals into the homes of millions.  Like Cronenberg's other films, there is a method to the madness, with links and themes to the media and a scathing social commentary on the media run world we live in.  The landmark makeup effects by Rick Baker showed the FX artist at the top of his game; creating disgustingly bizarre imagry and effects that top even most of the CGI gore you see in horror films now a days.  The Criterion DVD presents Videodrome in all it's uncut and unrated glory, and there are special features galore; including a featurette entitled Fear on Film, a vintage roundtable discussion between horror visionaries John Carpenter and John Landis, future film maker Mick Garris, and Cronenberg himself.  Videodrome is one of those movies you'll either love or hate, and for those who love it, this release is a must own.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I am probably the biggest simple plan fan there is and i was so excited to hear their new album. I preordered it and got it and was so surprised when i heard it. The sound is so awesome and is completly different from their first album. My favorite song is perfect world because it has a sound that everyone can relate to. The lyrics of the songs are so powerful and definetly teens my age can relate to. I suggest going out and buying this album its worth it cuz it also comes with an aweosme dvd!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Well, all I can say for this album is WOW!!! I fell totally in love with it when the first time I listened to it! It's totally different from the first album and soo much better! I can't wait for the next album! If you haven't got the album, I suggest you go to the nearest music store buy it right away! You won't regret it!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is like one of THE BEST albums of this year. Stop what you are doing right now and go buy it if you haven't already! It's very addicting and you will want to hear it 24/7. I can't get enough of hearing it and if you are a SP fan or want to hear GREAT music, buy this album!
630157401X|5.0|Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade brings together Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) with his father Mr. Jones Senior (Sean Connery)<br />The movie begins in Utah in 1912, with a young Indiana Jones (River Phoenix) being pursued by a gang of rogues, who want the antiquity he has just nabbed from them, as Indy believes that the treasure should be in a museum, and not as their personal possession.<br />Shooting forward to 1938, Indiana Jones is pressed into an adventure to find the fabled Holy Grail, which was sought by King Arthur's Knights of Camelot, among others.<br />Lots of exciting action takes Indy and his father from Venice to Nazi occupied Austria to Turkey, pitting him against<br />evil  Nazis, and including a beautiful lady archaeologist Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), whose greed tragically causes her to fall in with the bad guys.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade is far superior to the disappointing Temple of Doom, and as good as the first Indiana Jones, Raiders of the Lost Ark
B00063MBU8|1.0|Simple Plan's new CD is an awesome cd. It blends their personalities, writing ablilites, and musical talent to come up with an amazing secound album that tops their first!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I have bought this year! It switches from high tempo punk/rock drum beats in songs like \\"Shut Up\\", \\"Thank You\\" and \\"Jump\\". To stronger and slightly matured stringed songs such as \\"Perfect World\\", \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Promise\\". And then there's always a song or two that sends a shiver down your spine, I'm talking about \\"Untitled\\" and \\"Everytime\\", which fit into the album with surprising ease, which is quite refreshing! <br />The mixture of traditional Candadian Punk-Rock music that Simple Plan are known for has grown up a bit since their debut album \\"No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls\\". Many people may think this a bad thing, but if the truth be told it's had anything but a bad effect on the band, the music or they're fan-base! This is a MUST BUY... so what are you waiting for??!! <br /> <br />BUY IT!!
B00005O438|3.0|In 1983, director Lewis Teague unleashed a force more horrifying than anything that ever came from the mind of Stephen King.  Its name was: Danny Pintauro.  This sissified young actor would go on to almost completely nullify the obvious appeal of Alyssa Milano through all those years of Who's the Boss? before finally disappearing from the scene (hopefully for good).  It need never have happened.  Had Cujo never \\"introduced\\" Pintauro to the acting scene, I might never have been forced to come to terms with the fact that Will Wheaton was only the second most annoying child actor in the world.<br /><br />In terms of this film, let me say that, while there have been a number of less successful and ill-conceived adaptations of Stephen King's work, Cujo is my least favorite of all the Stephen King films.  Let's start with the fact that the novel is not conducive to a film adaptation in the first place - the idea of Cujo is a good one, but the characters and atmosphere of the story are as unappealing as meatloaf left out in the hot sun for about three months.  Vic Trenton (Daniel Hugh Kelly) is the only half-way sympathetic character to be found here, but he, unfortunately, looks like a reject from The Brady Bunch.  Then you have his wife Donna (Dee Wallace); not only is she unattractive, she is having an affair with one of her husband's friends.  And young Tad (Danny Pintauro) - I know he's a little kid, and we were all scared of the dark at that age, and all of us would have squawked incessantly if we were trapped in a car by a giant rabid hellhound, but he is just so incredibly annoying.  Less important characters, such as Donna's illicit boy toy and the dysfunctional Camber family, suck what little air is left over out of the room.  The town itself looks like it should have been abandoned ten years ago.  And the lighting - a sunny day has never been as depressing as what you see here.  I don't like the music, either, but I guess I've complained enough already.<br /><br />And what of Cujo himself?  Normally, as an animal lover, I would fall in love with any animal in a film.  Not Cujo.  Sure, he didn't go out and get rabies on purpose, but he had no business chasing that cute little bunny rabbit in to the bat-occupied hole in the ground in the first place.  On top of that, he proved unable to finish the job when he had the film's two least likable characters trapped.  I've got to give the canine actor his props, though, as he gave everything he had to this film.  He had to endure all kinds of miseries to take on the look of a rabid gigantic killer, and he held nothing back when told to attack people, cars, doors, windows - whatever.  He also, I am quite sure, did all of his own stunts.  Sadly, in yet another slap in the mug to canine actors everywhere, he was left entirely out of the credits.  He was the only actor in this production who deserved to have his name in lights, yet he didn't even rate the same dignity as the film's best boy and assistant cooks.<br /><br />Finally, I must say I was disheartened to find that the director lacked the courage to end the film the way Stephen King ended the novel.  A lot of people complained about King's ending, but it was the right one and should have carried over to the film adaptation.  Obviously, I pretty much hated watching Cujo, but I must admit that, by and large, it was a pretty good adaptation of King's novel (except for the ending, of course).  Effective it may be, but enjoyable it is not./> <br />And what of Cujo himself?  Normally, as an animal lover, I would fall in love with any animal in a film.  Not Cujo.

B00005JMYI|5.0|By far the funniest movie i ever saw.  First time i saw it i had had a few drinks and laughed my butt off and cried through half the movie.  Me and my buddy thought that maybe it was just the alcohol, so we went back and saw it again and still couldn't stop laughing and crying. <br />Will ferrell really shines in this movie, so much unexpected stuff like the fight scene.  I now use this movie to judge people i meet.  If they didn't like the movie or didn't get it, i don't even bother with them cause they won't get me. <br />Why do we have to wait so long for the DVD?
B00063MBU8|5.0|I've always been a Simple Plan fan, I actually got their 1st CD, No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls, the day it came out and I loved it. When I got this CD I totally fell in love all over again! These guys are absolutly amazing!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This cd rocks insanely much!  There are some great tunes, and although simple plan's old stuff was amazing too, their new stuff explores more and showcases their amazing musical talent.  I just love the whole thing, and I'd give it more than 5 stars if it were possible.  They have amazing guitars, drums, lyrics, vox, everything you want in a great pop-punk album.   Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br />1. Shut Up!- 5/5 - This song rox very much.  It has a great intro, and i love how its put together.  Very simple, yet awesome. <br />2. Welcome To My Life- 5/5 - The first single off the album.  What can i say? Another awesome song! <br />3. Perfect World- 3.5/5 - Not one of the better songs on the album.  I dunno, its a little darker than the typical upbeat pop-punk-y Simple Plan sound, but its still good. <br />4. Thank You- 5/5 - One of my favorite songs on the album.  Very upbeat and happy, very sarcastically good! <br />5. Me Against the World- 4/5 - Another darker tune, but it still rox.  Again, a little different, but more expressive, and still good. <br />6. Crazy- 5/5 - A very good song.  Easy to listen to, and a nice song overall. <br />7. Jump- 5/5 - Holy moly!  This song is amazing!  I love it so much!  The intro guitar rox so much!  One word: Wow! <br />8. Everytime- 4/5 - Not too upbeat, but still ok. <br />9. Promise- 5/5 - Very very resembling of old Simple Plan.  I love this song, i've probably listened to it 50 times.  Another one of my favorites. <br />10. One- 5/5 - I like this one a lot.  Its a very good track. <br />11. Untitled- 4/5 - Also a little dark, kinda weird, but i still like it. <br /> <br />There ya go, guys.  Proving that good stuff really does come out of Canada!  Lol very good album, nice job on the part of Simple Plan.  Great sophomore album, keep it up!  Peace
B00063MBU8|5.0|I love this album! I am 18 and A HUGE Simple Plan Fan...I love the song \\"Welcome to my life\\" I really relate to it...this whole album is really great! but like I always say opinions are like noses everybodys got one!!! lol but seriously BUY THIS ALBUM it totally ROCKS!!!!
B000667FN8|5.0|I must say when I bought No Pads, No Helmets.. Just Balls, I fell in love with the band right away.  Although a little punk-poppish with their melody's of being dumped, and teen angst all-in-all it was a great CD.  Now, with Still Not Getting Any, you can tell Simple Plan truly matured.  With their songs of death and questioning what the world has come to and if everyone is truly 'crazy' they have come to truly earn the title of men.  A must buy, and a definate best seller.  We can only anticipate what other songs can come out of the five French-Canadian guys from Quebec.
B0006213WG|5.0|This album does sound a lot different from \\"Does This Look Infected\\" and \\"All Killer No Filler\\", but it rocks!  No Reason, We're All To Blame, everything, just kicks butt.  I would HIGHLY reccommend buying this CD, Its definitely worth the price listed.  If I were you I would buy it from like Barnes and Noble or a local store so you don't have to deal with shipping fees and waiting forever for it to arrive...
B00063MBU8|5.0|We have all come to know and love Simple Plan with hit singles including \\"I'm Just a Kid\\",\\"I'd Do Anything\\", \\"Addicted\\", and of course, \\"Perfect\\" from thier 2002 release 'No Pads,No Helmets...Just Balls'.  Well the guys are at it again! They released thier new album, 'Still Not Getting Any...' on October,26th.  There is definately a sign of a little more maturity music wise in this record.  Some of the songs like 'Untitled' and 'Everytime' are alot lighter sounding than the past record. But, \\"Me Against The World\\" shows a whole other side of them. It's is by far the heaviest song they have ever written.  Of course, Simple Plan puts on an amazing live show and what better song to play live than \\"Jump\\"...which is a great pop/rock song about not having a care in the world and just wanting to have fun and jump around at a concert.  The music on this record is not the only awesome thing.  It is also a DualDisc, which means that on one side you get 11 amazing songs and on the other you get the making of the record,lyrics,photos, and more!  Well in interviews explaining the album title Simple Plan has said \\"Reviews!  We're still not getting any good reviews!\\" Well here ya go guys! I give you 5 stars, great work!!
1400031001|5.0|\\"Any Human Heart\\" is a gloriously crafted masterpiece of modern fiction and undoubtedly William Boyd's best novel to date.  <br /> <br />The life of fictional character Logan Mounstuart is told in real time through a process of revelation as we trawl through the pages of his pristinely kept personal diary, where trivialities of a deeply personal nature, sometimes revealed in deeply embarrassing voyeuristic detail, are juxtaposed against experiences that mark his accidental collision with 20th Century social history in the making. Without the benefit of hindsight and a false 20/20 vision that an omniscient narrator would have provided, Logan's words are vibrant with currency and charged with a spontaneity and immediacy that guarantees honesty and integrity. As we follow him through his school years, his brush with the Bloomsbury set in England, his experiences during the Great Depression, the Spanish Civil War, his mix up in wartime espionage, leading to his sad personal decline and descent into abject poverty as the century draws to a close, we are left with the distinct impression that Logan's lifetime highs and lows are seldom of his own choosing and the insight that it isn't what life delivers but how we deal with its challenges that finally matter.  <br /> <br />The novel is also brimful with thrilling episodes - far too many to enumerate - as Logan's career  undergoes a series of dramatic transformation - though his scary encounter with the sinister Duke and Duchess of Windsor is easily the most memorable.  <br /> <br />Boyd's ultimate coup de grace may lie in his storytelling technique, which reveals an uncommon deftness in keeping Logan always deeply human and ordinary, thus enabling him to tell a story of an extraordinary life and making it utterly believable.  <br /> <br />Boyd's prose is sharp, poised, humorous and intelligent. \\"Any Human Heart\\" is hence a wondrously literate yet emotionally generous piece of work that glows with resonance recalling greatliterary giants like Evelyn Waugh. Few fictional writers today manage to find and convey that delicate balance. Boyd has done it. \\"Any Human Heart\\" is enduring contemporary literature of the finest quality that deserves to be read and enjoyed by all. Highly recommended.
B00063MBU8|5.0|if you are a big fan of this great band you have to buy this .. but if your not you will become a fan with this cd.. every song is powerful with lyrics full of feelings that you can relate to.. buy this you will no regret it..!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I am a huge Simple Plan fan, and this made me an even bigger fan! <br /> It's just that awsome.  I love every song.  It's alot different from No Pads, No Helmets....Just Balls.  They took a different aprouch on this one, and it paid off!  They just wanted to write and record good songs and thats what they did.  My Fav songs were, Shut Up!, Welcome To My Life, Perfect World, Thank You, Me Against The World, Crazy, Jump, Everytime, Promise, One, and Untitled.  Just an awsome CD!!
0156027321|5.0|This was refreshing, it is a reilief to find this book amidst all the other spy, government, \\"my life\\", books which are basically copying each other. If you want someting wonderful, different, flavourful and most of all enjoyable, get this book. <br /> <br />I love the physical feel of it too, not heavy, the dimensions are good, easy to carry around. Best of all it is affordable. <br /> <br />Yann Martel, well done, I am from one of Piscene's religions and you have captured the way the things of my religion appeal to me. <br /> <br />Well done, I wait with bated breath for your next book. <br /> <br />Ahbaid
B00003IPFK|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever. Duvall is one of my favorite actors and he has given many great performances in his career, but his portrayal of McCrae is nearly unbelievable. And as for Tommy Lee Jones, other than Coal Miner's Daughter, he has not done anything else that even comes close to his portrayal of Woodrow Call, NOT EVEN CLOSE! The interaction and contrast of these 2 actors and characters is outstanding. Although these 2 are the stars and lead characters of the movie, all the actors and characters are magnificent, and I don't say that lightly.     It is hard to express how good this movie is. Adventurous, funny, sad, dramatic, melancholy, moving, beautiful, and yes.....long. The funny thing with me was that as long as the movie was, I hated to see it end.    The gushing reviews written here are real and sincere, not phony, hyped up reviews. If you are wondering why the reviews consist of much acclaim and admiration, but of little detail as to the content of the movie, it is because the movie is far too big for that. That may sound a little convenient, but this movie is truly an epic and cannot be compared to the Westerns of the past. As good as many Westerns have been, Lonesome Dove is simply superior in practically every category...again, I do not say that lightly.     If you are a movie buff, whether you like \\"westerns\\" or not, or if you like Duvall or Jones, you are cheating yourself if you do not watch this one. There is a reason why there is so much acclaim here among those who have actually seen the movie.    Edit: Jones has been excellent in some more recent movies I have seen - No Country for Old Men , In the Electric Mist, In the Valley of Elah,  The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada. Some I liked more than others, but Jones was terrific. Duvall is always terrific.
B00005JMH2|5.0|I loved this movie!!!  I just couldn't help smiling through the whole thing.  Beautiful, funny and charming.  Definately worth seeing!
B00006879E|3.0|Amidst hordes of boy bands and teeny boppers, this album stands out in that it is actually a work of ART; granted, many of the musical and lyrical elements are trite and overused, but the songs all have a distinctive style that pervades the album--evidence that the band has put work into their music rather than paying off a lyricist and a composer. There is definitely potential here. <br /> <br />However, many aspects of this album are somewhat, if not highly overrated. I find it saddening that Maroon 5 has been so often commended for their original lyrics and music--what happened to the days of bands such as Led Zeppelin, who composed, wrote, and performed nearly ALL of their music? And for those who have all raved about Levine's unique voice--have you ever heard of NSYNC? A mildly persuasive speaker could easily have persuaded me that this entire album was sung by Justin Timberlake.  <br /> <br />Style: distinctive, but a few of the songs are a bit too obviously influenced by earlier artists; definitely has the potential to be developed into something unique and interesting. 8/10. <br /> <br />Lyrics: a little trite, but hats off to Adam Levine for actually writing them himself; it's better than it could be. 6/10. <br /> <br />Vocals: Mr. Levine, meet Mr. Timberlake; but the range is decent, though the falsetto gets a bit annoying. 6/10. <br /> <br />Music: at least they're playing their own guitar; decent, but not anything particularly remarkable. 7/10. <br /> <br />Overall verdict: 7/10.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is a load of crap.  All he does is distort the truth, and edits the movie to make it seem bad when it really isn't.  For example when President Bush is playing golf and he says \\"We're going to get these terroists, now watch me hit this ball\\"  Their is 19 minutes of him talking about other stuff between \\"We're going to get these terroists\\" and \\"Now watch me hit this ball\\".  Oh the magic of editing.  Don't give this lying fat piece of lard your money.
B000667FN8|5.0|this cd is the best. you can tell how much work was put into this and how the guys have grown. from track one to eleven all the songs you can relate to. they have catchy lyrics and awesome beats. it's definetly worth buying. plus it's the first dualdisc. what could be cooler?!
0061007137|5.0|It's 1966, and Adam Scott received 500 pounds and an envelope in his father's will.  The envelope contained the key to his family's lost honor, and leads to an item in the vault of a Swiss bank - a Russian icon thought lost, that also contains a secret. <br /> <br />The secret is so powerful, the KGB will do anything to get it's hands on it.  A top agent is assigned unlimited resources.  When Adam retrieves the icon moments ahead of him, he suddenly finds his girlfriend dead, and himself on the run from the KGB, the CIA, British Intelligence, and the Swiss police.  Armed with only a small amount of money and his own wits, can he survive the hunt - and restore his family's lost honor? <br /> <br />There is no doubt his novel heavily influenced Dan Brown (Da Vinci Code), as the elements of a hunted man, an enemy with only a code name, and a hero who seizes opportunities all come into play.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's new record has definitely stepped up both lyrically and instrumentally. Although I don't want to say it..it did \\"mature\\". However, it still has the same up-beat tune Simple Plan is known for. \\"Untitled\\" is a new sound for the guys and I love it! This track is among one of my favorites. Everyone can relate to at least one song on this album. <br /> <br />I love Simple Plan so much. This is truly amazing and I'm really proud of what the guys have produced.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I think I'm a highly objective person when it comes to music. I'm not going to be like \\"OMG THAY R 2 HAWT THE BEST EVAR!!111one\\", because they are not my favorite band of all time. However, they are up there on my list. They have a nice, unusual sound. Mike Shinoda, who more than raised my eyebrow when I heard he was Japanese and a rapper for Linkin Park, has one of the most soothing rap voices I've ever heard--he sounds gruff but he takes his words smoothly; his words don't really blur together like so many other rappers'. Chester also has a very calming voice--that is, when he isn't screaming at the top of his lungs. And the melody of the band--a fusion of sounds produced by Rob, Pheonix, Brad, and Joe--is also very unique sounding and overall nice. Some songs convey a great amount of anger while others are softer. <br /> <br />I don't think it's fair to impose that Linkin Park's success is just because they're \\"main stream\\" rock. They're main stream for a reason--people like them. That isn't to say they're hard core and intense, but they do have tons of talent. Nothing is greater than breaking up with someone and blasting \\"In the End.\\" Or feeling stressed and screaming out the lyrics to \\"Faint.\\"  <br /> <br />They always sound angry. And that's awesome. <br /> <br />The following are basically what I got out of the songs. I won't bother rating them because each of them has grown on me. <br /> <br />Foreword--an opening that sounds like a glass crashing. It leads directly into the next song. <br /> <br />Don't Stay--the first real track on the CD, and it's a perfect example of what we expect from Linkin Park--angry, screaming, and basically just a good song. It's pretty much about being suffocated. I have to admit I was none too fond of it at first, but after giving it a fair listen, it really did become one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Somewhere I Belong--anyone's who's ever felt awkward or out of place will like this one. Good rapping on Mike's part, a very interesting melody, and Chester adds a nice twist to it in the chorus with a little bit of yelling. Because that's what we like. <br /> <br />Lying From You--about the lies people tell. Not my favorite on the CD but it has its merits: The chorus is pretty groovy. <br /> <br />Hit the Floor--more anger and screaming, and this time really about love/hate relationships. Again, not my favorite, but I find myself listening to it anyway. <br /> <br />Easier to Run--I really like this one. The pre-chorus little chant thing that Mike does is pretty awesome; nice rhyming and beat. <br /> <br />Faint--the jewel on the album in my opinion. Mike does a great job rapping, Chester is really, er, loud, and the others put together a very fast-paced heart-speeding beat. About angry love. <br /> <br />Figure.09--the chorus I'm not a fan of, but the verses seem to be written well. I think that enough time just wasn't spent on it. <br /> <br />Breaking the Habit--the most overrated song on the whole CD. It got like, so much coverage and stuff. It just doesn't appeal to me I guess--the lyrics are good but the melody to me just sounds awkward. <br /> <br />From the Inside--probably the softest song on the album. This is the one you let your loud-sound-fearing parents listen to. <br /> <br />Nobody's Listening--underrated. It's got a lot of rapping in it and seems to err more on that side, Mike does a good job as does Chester in the chorus. Listen for: \\"But it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt/And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt\\". <br /> <br />Session--I usually skip over it. Just a mix of different sounds. <br /> <br />Numb--there are stark similarities in this one to \\"In The End\\"; I prefer \\"In The End,\\" but this is another must-listen on the album. Probably my third favorite song because Chester sounds very fragile and angry. <br /> <br />That's really all I have to see about the whole thing. Linkin Park is a great band that takes a lot of guff from the people whodon't like their music. Basically, if the whole rap/rock/angst fusion isn't your thing, don't listen. If it sounds like something you might be into, give them a listen. It won't your taste in music anyway.
6305696071|5.0|I CANNOT believe that anyone would give this movie a BAD review...THAT sickens ME. I apologize, but to sound a little more sophmoric: How can anyone NOT like Pretty Woman?! It's a classic for the 90's, one of the movies of our generation! Not to mention the fact of it's financial success...it is a GOOD movie, and yes even for families. We all know prostitution is not a glamorous, respected or celebrated \\"career\\", but COME ON folks that's why it's a M-O-V-I-E. We all know that it's not nice to go chopping people's heads' off with light sabers either, but that doesn't hinder the critical acclaim of Star Wars now does it? And puh leeze don't start attacking with the \\"comparing-lowly-pretty-woman-to-the-exaulted-holy-star-wars-phenomena\\" comments...my point still stands. Don't listen to all the cynics here, if you love romantic comedies, this is a movie worth your time.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Not much to say, especially this long after the debut was released; besides RATM, their hasn't been a band this good since 1991. I know that's not saying much since rock kind of fell apart after the grunge movement, but that doesn't take away from the fact that these guys are breathtaking. God Bless real Rock 'n Roll.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|The Matrix is one of the my favorite movies. When I first saw it, it blew me away and it still does every time I watch it now. I was just mildy entertained by the sequels however. They don't live up to their full potential. The Matrix itself is what is fascinating and the sequels focus too much on Zion. When you heard Tank talk about Zion in the first one, is it something you actually wanted to see in the sequels ?<br /><br />  The 2nd movie is better than the 3rd but still it doesn't have enough action in the Matrix and the beginning and middle spends too much time in Zion. The only time Reloaded realy lives up to some of it's potential is in the Highway fight scene that I never get tired of watching. Two fun new villains called the twins make that scene even more entertaining. They can go through any object they choose to which makes it hard for Morphious and Trinity to get away from them. They are one of the better parts of Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions could've used them.<br /><br />  Revolutions itself is what totally spends too much time in the real world with Zion. Sure is some good human versues machines action but die hard fans of the Matrix like myself loved the original for the Kun-fu and fascinating science fiction. We don't get much of either in Matrix Revolutions. It doesn't even end that satisfying and makes fans wonder what the hell just happened and ask \\"is this really how the trilogy ends ?\\". Watching the first one again on HBO a few nights back I realized more just how much potential was wasted. The Matrix blows my mind and the sequels just make me say....that was ok but that's it ? They're entertaining but not exactly what we waited patiently for when we first heard there would be sequels.
B000002UJQ|5.0|i dont like radiohead or their music, i think it is boring. but i do think it is very creative and a good break from the popular music scence today. i only wrote this review and only gave them five stars in response to j.fridays review calling them ugly. what does what they look like have anything to do with the music? and who are you to judge them? they have way more artistic skills than 99% of the population of the world. they write music that inspires bands and people everywhere. and you are giving them one star because they are UGLY??? it is just more proof of the state of music today. looks over musical talent. that makes me sick.
B00005JNEI|5.0|People who reviewed this movie without actually watching the it are exactly the people who should see it. Unfortunately they want to remain in their illusionary bubble that supports the notion that the \\"President of THE USA\\" could never have selfish motives for his actions while in office. Well this film proves that there was one: George Bush. I regret more people didn't watch it before the election. He would have never been re elected. Even if only a few of the items that Micheal Moore found and related in the film were true, George Bush shouldn't have been re elected; he should have been impeached! It is a must see for every American.
B000002LUB|5.0|All I can say is this is one of the heaviest metal records ever recorded period. I bought this on cassette in 1992 and I practically wore it out during my month at Keesler AFB MS. This is just raw, unadulterated metal at it's best. Dio is in the best form of his career, he sings with anger and passion. His lyrics are more dark, less mythical. It works well, though. Iommi is just as impressive, his playing is just so damned heavy. Geezer Butler's playing is inspired, he jams. And My boy, Vinny Appice's drumming is brutal, simpler than Mob but equal to most Dio records. This should be a part of every metal fans catalog. Computer God, After All(the dead), the haunting Too Late, I, Time Machine, TV Crimes and my fave Sins Of The Father, one of the best Sabbath songs ever written and Vinny's finest hour. Too bad this lineup didn't last, again. Hey, Iommi what's up dude. Tony Martin sucks man!!Your loss dude. Oh well, it's a masterpiece to me. It combines the heaviness of Early Ozzy Sabbath with DIO and Vinny. Simply Crushing and brutal. Hail to Dio's last stand with Sabbath. Buy it knuckleheads!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Their album may say they are \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" but in the case of album sales its quite the oppisite! I was one of the first to get their new album \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" I waited outside the store at the mall for it to open at 10 a.m. like many other big Simple Plan fan. The album has everything and more. I'm pleased to say they did not disapoint me at all. My favourite tracks on the album are \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"Jump\\". I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did! 5 stars *. Good work guys and see ya at the shows! <br /> <br />Still Not Getting Any, <br />Brendan
B00063MBU8|5.0|I love this Cd and I just saw them in concert.  I have been listening to Simple Plan for years and I was not disappointed when I bought this cd.  I recommend everyone to go out and buy it.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Whether you were a fan before the single \\"Welcome To My Life\\" came out, or whether you just heard the song and decided you had to find out more about the CD it is on, you should order it right this very moment because it is one of the best CD's I've heard all year. In fact, the only thing that is a reasonable excuse for not ordering it at this very second is that you are still reading this review..and that is still not good enough.  <br /> <br />The CD is made up of 11 songs... <br /> <br />1. Shut Up- I'd give this song a 4 out of 5 stars. The song has a great beat and awesome lyrics and the only reason it didn't get a five is because it didn't give me the chill factor... <br /> <br />2. Welcome To My Life- 5 of 5 stars This song is one of the best on the CD. It was a great pick for the first single, and even though it isn't my absolute favorite it is right up there. The song is very easy to relate to, and the lyrics and the music are both excellent. This song gave me the chills when I first heard it.  <br /> <br />3. Perfect World- 5 out of 5 stars. This song is also easily one of my favorites on the CD. Like all of the other songs it has both great music and great lyrics. This song may sound like a sappy break up song at first, but after listening to it a couple of times it will gradually work itself into your brain.  <br /> <br />4. Thank You- 4 of 5 stars. This song has a very upbeat peppy beat and sounds very energized. The lyrics tell about betrayal, something that anyone over the age of 7 can probably relate to and the song is magnificent.  <br /> <br />5. Me Against the World- 4 of 5 stars. This song also plays with a person's emotions. Most teenagers will be able to relate to the lyrics, because once in a while everyone feels like the world is completely against them. The music is great as well as the lyrics.  <br /> <br />6. Crazy- 5 of 5 stars. This song really is great. Even my mother, a woman in her early fourties liked it. It deals with some of the issues in our world right now...it talks about plastic surgery, the stress on children when their parents are fighting, the way the world is obsessed with money etc. Once again this song has great music as well <br /> <br />7. Jump- 4 of 5 This song is definetly one of the most energized on the album. If you can stop dancing for a moment you'll see that the lyrics are as good as the music.  <br /> <br />8. Everytime- 4 of 5. Another song that makes you want to play it to your ex-love. The lyrics are great on this song.  <br /> <br />9. Promise- 4 of 5. This song, like everytime, has great lyrics. If you've ever wanted to keep a relationship with a lover in tact this song is for you.  <br /> <br />10. One- 5 of 5. This is probably my favorite song on the album. It seriously made chills go up my spine. There are no words to describe this song except--mind-blowing <br /> <br />11. Untitled- 5 of 5. This song made me want to cry. The music is very beautiful and the lyrics are very painful. I love songs that make you sad, or songs that make you feel any strong emotions at all.  <br /> <br />So all in all this album is one of the best of the year and you should probably go and buy it before stores are sold out!!!
B000002R6A|4.0|The Repertoire label has just released a remastered version of this album, currently available on Amazon UK, and the sound quality is truly amazing - makes the One Way and Japanese Polydor CD's sound thin and weak in comparison.    A cursory glance through other reviews will show the potential buyer that this was an album you either loved or hated.  No question that there are some filler tracks here - my advice is to program out \\"I'm Dying, Or Am I?\\", \\"Gemini\\" & \\"The Madman\\".  What you're left with is one of the great unsung and underappreciated albums of the psychedelic era.  Andy Summers' solo on Traffic's \\"Coloured Rain\\" is a revelation - this alone is worth the price of admission.  Add in a fantastic take on the Bee Gees' \\"To Love Somebody\\" and a unique interpretation of Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\", among others, and you've got an indispensible relic of the late 60's.    4 out of 5 stars for the aforementioned filler.    By the way, Repertoire also issued Eric & the Animals' penultimate album, \\"Every One of Us\\", at the same time.
B00005CDNJ|5.0|Ever since I bought a turntable, a whole new realm of cheap music that I would never have dared paid a rediculous CD price for (or thought of buying in the first place) opened up to me.   <br /> <br />Looking through some used album bins, I found some ABBA stuff, and hey, for a dollar a piece there's no reason not to buy them!  So I picked them up, laughed at myself, and brought them home and listened.   <br /> <br />I bought The Album and Arrival, besides one or two good album cuts they were just all about the hits.  \\"Eh, just what I expected, a singles band with mediocre albums\\" I thought to myself.  Then for some unexplained reason, I bought Super Trouper.  There was just something about the oh-so-glamourous cover I guess.   <br /> <br />So I drop the needle, and \\"Super Trouper\\" starts, which I already knew but never cared much for.  For some weird reason, it sounded really good!  Then \\"Winner Takes It All,\\" which I've never heard before, completely nailed me with that incredible, emotive vocal performance.  By the time I got around to the chorus of \\"On And On And On\\" and found myself dancing furiously as only a white guy can furiously dance I knew I was in the presence of one incredibly stupid-fun album.   <br /> <br />By the time I got through the joyously pompous synth-brass blasts of \\"Me And I,\\" the reflective ballad \\"Happy New Year,\\" the quasi-Gentle Giant recorder breaks of the absurd track \\"The Piper\\" up through the over-the-top closing piece \\"The Way Old Friends Do\\" I came to the conclusion that I had just experienced one of the most rediculously entertaining albums I've heard for a while.    <br /> <br />There isn't a single song on this album that I don't enjoy immensely, with the exception of \\"Our Last Summer\\" which I think kind of kills the otherwise perfect flow of the album.  The other ABBA albums I have (Arrival, The Album, and Voulez Vous) are nowhere close as far as having the tremendous hooks, variety, and entertainment value that Super Trouperoffers.   <br /> <br />I never thought I'd see the day, but my Yes, Genesis, Led Zeppelin and King Crimson albums sit comfortably and proudly next to ABBA albums, Super Trouper in particular.  Get it today!
B000244FDW|5.0|Would it be blasphemous to say that I love this 1985 version almost as much as I love the famous 1995 Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth version? <br /> <br />Yes, I saw this version well before the A&E version and watched it regularly since it came out on VHS. Thank goodness for this dvd because my videotape is about to wear out!  I just think this version feels closer to the book somehow. There are no tight bodices or a wet shirt Mr. Darcy, but it is enjoyable and engaging all the same. I love Elizabeth Garvie as Lizzy Bennet. She just completely captures the spirit of Elizabeth Bennet for me: playful, pretty, charming, witty and engaging, and with those lovely big brown eyes. David Rintoul is a handsome, aristocratic Darcy and all the actors are perfectly cast. I must say I always had a problem with the casting of Jane Bennet (not pretty enough), the Bingley sisters (no resemblance) and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner (not elegant at all) in the 1995 version, but not so here. Jane is perfectly amiable and lovely in the guise of Sabina Franklin and the Gardiners are elegant and well-bred as they should be. The actresses who play Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley also do look like sisters.  There is also no over-the-top acting which sometimes overshadowed other actors/characters. <br /> <br />The only downside of this version is, of course, that the budget was less than its 1995 counterpart and so most of the filming took place on sets instead of on the real thing. The costumes and locations are simpler.  However, the actors and story treatment more than make up for its shortcomings and this version is a must have for any Jane Austen fan's movie library.  If you've only seen the 1995 version and a true Jane Austen fan, be sure to check this one out.  It is a gem that deserves to be seen!
0634060384|4.0|Take note, this book contains no lyrics, thankfully.    Like many musicians I have owned a copy of the, \\"Real Book 5th Edition\\" for a long time.  I use it at rehearsals, I take it to gigs, and over years of use it has received a lot a wear and tear.  As you may know the, \\"Real Book 5th Edition\\" is a home made publication, it is not available to the general public it is sold by musicians to musicians.  Consequently finding a copy is very difficult, and replacing a worn out copy is just as difficult.  Despite its limited availability it is used by musicians all over the world and has become a standard piece of equipment any jazz gig.    Hal-Leonard's \\"Real Book 6th Edition\\", at first glance, appears to a fully licensed duplicate of the, \\"Real Book 5th Edition\\" however, it is NOT.    The cover is the same, the type set is the same, many of the songs are the same, and most of the keys match the, \\"Real Book 5th Edition.\\"  Unfortunately, many important songs are missing including: \\"Gentle Rain\\", \\"Pennsativa\\", \\"Green Dolphin St.\\", \\"Days of Wine & Roses\\", \\"Spain\\", \\"A Foggy Day\\", and all frank Zappa songs.  Some great songs have been added including: \\"Whispering\\", \\"Nuage\\", \\"Topsy\\", \\"That's Amore\\", \\"Easter Parade\\", \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\", and many more.  A few songs appear in a different key than the, \\"5th Edition\\" including: \\"Windows\\" and \\"Here's That Rainy Day.\\"  There are also some corrections including: \\"Blue Train\\" changed from Cm blues to Eb blues; \\"Equinox\\" changed from Cm to C#m; the chords to \\"Four\\" have been 'corrected'; the bass lines of \\"So What\\" and \\"Maiden\\" have also been corrected.    The result of Hal-Leonard's efforts gives us a great fake book which is easy to read and easy to buy.  The song selection is great, but it is different form the, \\"5th Edition\\" this will present a problem when someone on a gig calls, \\"Conference of the Birds\\" or any other song not in this book.    What made the, \\"Real Book 5th Edition\\" a standard for so many years was the factthat it was one of a kind.  Each song had it's own page, the type set was large and clear, the chords were simple and to the point, the songs listed were ones that musicians played, and the arrangements were streamlined (but accurate), for years this was the only book that used this style.     Today, however, many fake books published by Warner Brother, Sher Music, and Hal-Leonard use this style.  Consequently great music and quality arrangements are easily accessible to all musicians.  There is no longer a need for the, \\"Real Book 5th Edition\\" it has been replaced by fully legal and more accurate publications.  Hal-Leonard's, \\"Real Book 6th Edition\\" is another one of the new generation fake books.    I hope all the songs missing from the, \\"Sixth Edition\\" appear in books 2 or 3 which are due out soon.
B00006S2PG|5.0|In 1970 keyboard player Keith Emerson of Nice and Greg Lake of King Crimson bolted from their groups and joined with drummer Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster to form the most successful power trio in the history of progressive rock. Only Renaissance could be said to have more explicitly incorporated classical music into its sound that Emerson, Lake & Palmer. The trio were regarded as technical virtuosos on their instruments, to such a point that their performances surely could not match their reputations. Lake might not be as great a guitarist as the other two were on their instruments, but when I was a lad if you had given me my choice of any one's voice in rock and roll, I would have wanted to sing like Greg Lake (Emerson, Lake & Palmer also have some of the more interesting \\"what ifs\\" around in terms of their origin, since there were rumors of Jimi Hendrix joining the group and Steve Howe of Yes actually auditioned).<br /><br />The self-tilted 1971 debut album (mostly recorded the previous year), made it to #18 on the Billboard album chart and is a mix of the bombastic synthesizer overkill that could dominate some of their early work (such as the first side of their next album, \\"Tarkus\\") and the subtle balance between Lake's vocals and Emerson's piano playing. The former is represented by the instrumental opening track, \\"The Barbarian,\\" which sets up a radical shift to the former with \\"Take a Pebble.\\"  This song was ELP's first released single, and would become one of the improvisational standards of the group in concert. The \\"first side\\" ends with \\"Knife-Edge,\\" based on a theme by Janacek I believe, and is one of the rare examples of balance between Emerson's synthesizer and Lake's vocals. You have to remember that the synthesizer was a new toy at that time and perhaps Emerson should be forgiven for taking it out so relentlessly at times on a test drive.<br /><br />\\"The Three Fates,\\" like \\"Take a Pebble,\\" owes much to classical forms and provides ample evidence of my contention that Emerson was much more proficient on a piano than on an organ. \\"Tank\\" represents the third synthesized work while \\"Lucky Man,\\" the group's first hit single, showcases Lake's haunting vocals against an acoustic guitar, with a synthesizer solo at the end (but the song only made it to #48 in 1971 and #51 in 1973; go figure).  You cannot help but wonder what else Greg lake might have written if he did not have to contend with Emerson's propensity towards longer and longer keyboard works. On Emerson, Lake & Palmer's debut album we end up with three synthesizer songs and three piano/guitar songs and whichever type you prefer, it is going to dictate which of their other albums you are going to enjoy.ce of my contention that Emerson was much more proficient on a piano than on an organ. \\"Tank\\" represents the third synthesized work while \\"Lucky Man,\\" the group's first hit single, showcases Lake's haunting vocals against an acoustic guitar, with a synthesizer solo at the end (but the song only made it to #48 in 1971 and #51 in 1973; go figure).

B00063MBU8|5.0|OMG, this CD totally rocks. I went out to buy it the first day it came out because I've been supporting these guys since the first debuted CD and they're just gettting better. I agree that they have grown up alot from No Pads, No Helmets,...Just Balls and every song has a message. I love how a lot kids can probbly relate with almost every song. I personally relate with Welcome to my Life and almost cried about Crazy. I would recommend this CD to anybody. This CD is so good, that almost anybody would love it. Go out and buy it, I promise you won't regret it.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I've been a Nightwish fan for years and if I wasn't this album would of made me one. They're the type of band that sounds exactly the same live as they do on album without the lip syncing of many many famous singers...Ashlee Simpson, Christina Aguilera, Brittney, etc etc etc. They write all their music and tweek it before they record instead of writing an album with all studio machines and attempt to play it live like certain bands....linkin park. This album it's beyond amazing. It's powerful, melodic, the lyrics are meaningful, the guitars on a dime can go from aggressive and fast to very light and slow. Nightwish is one of the greatest bands of all time just how they so flawlessly mix metal, opera, and classical together without spending all their time in the studio trying to make a lump of crap turn to gold. What they did was patiently make gold and turn it to diamonds.
0763611883|5.0|Lola is a very fussy eater, with a long list of food items that she doesn't eat. Topping that list are tomatoes, which she \\"absolutely will never not ever eat.\\" But big brother Charlie hits on an ingenious plan to get Lola to eat the things on her \\"veto\\" list. The carrots, he says, are not carrots but \\"orange twiglets from Jupiter.\\" Intrigued, Lola tries them and likes them. Charlie turns peas, mashed potato, and fish sticks into similarly imaginative things, with the same result. Child uses mixed media to illustrate the humorous interaction between the siblings-a successful combination of photographs and hand drawings. Different fonts indicate emphasis and highlight the despised food items. Wavy and colored lines of text provide variety and added interest. The language is suitable for reading aloud to preschoolers. Child presents an amusing take on picky eaters, and the ending shows that Lola might not have been completely ignorant of Charlie's ploy.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I got this cd for my birthday which was also October 26, and since I got it I have not quit listening to it. It is my most favorite one in all of my collection. Pierre's voice is just the best that I have ever heard, and I would so recommend this to anyone that likes Good Charlotte and Blink-182.
B00008PW2D|4.0|True, this season is shorter than the rest (only 8 episodes here), it still managed to provide the normal laughs and heartbreaks like any other season. Miranda has her baby, Brody with Steve even though she chooses to raise him alone, and Carrie spends the season single, eventually meeting Berger, whom she develops a crush on. Samantha finally dumps Richard after she spies on him, proving that he'd been cheating on her. Her disguise, with the Raquel Welsh wig is priceless. Carrie still hasn't gotten over her love for shoes (that won't ever go away) and still seems to have trouble with them. In this case, Miranda's water breaks on them... The girls really grow up this season, as most face life, still single, but are okay with that.
B000003S09|1.0|King Crimson symbolises all that is bad about 70s 'rock.'  It amounts to little more than pretentious little boys who have no understanding of rock and roll at all.  The result is tedious, self indugent, crap posing as meaningful rock music.  For your own sake buy The Velvet underground and Nico, White Light/White Heat, The Velvet Underground and Loaded and you will have four perfect examples of rock and roll.  Once you have done this you will no doubt want to distroy all your King Crimson albums and deny ever having owned then or even having bothered to listen to them.  Sad!
B00004RFCM|4.0|'Sex and the City' started its first season introducing us to the four gals, Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha. This season, Carrie meets Mr. Big, who will be her on-again, off-again love interest for seasons to come. Miranda dates Skipper for a while and Samantha dates everybody. Charlotte, the more traditional of the group, will not sleep with anyone on the first date, unless it's a certain Jewish art collecter. Hmm... It's amazing how frank the subject matter is. There isn't a sexual topic that this show has looked over. My friends and I started renting the series and having 'Sex and the City'-a-thons. This is a great series and started off really well in its first season. It only gets better...
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore is a lying idiot.  He creates lies and puts them into a highly advertised movie.  Once the television previews lure young people into the theatres, his lies manipulate the minds of these poor young children.  His so called \\"documentaries\\" are used to brainwash people my age.  I am only 17 and I know that a few of my friends went to watch this film and came back just believing that the U.S.A was a terrible place to live because of President Bush.  President Bush is a great man with great morals and beliefs.  I cannot believe some one would have the nerve to publicly try to humiliate our President.  Michael Moore is an idiot.  He just needs to tell the truth before making a film and making a fool of himself.  I love the U.S.A and hate Michael Moore.  If you are a patriot to this great country, I advise you not to support this fool buy watching and listening to his lies.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I loved \\"No pads, no helmets, just balls...\\" but this cd is even better! it's different than their first one, but not too different. It's still the simple plan we all love! And the last song \\"untitled\\" is very different with the piano and all, but i absolutely love it! The dvd is hilarious...as always! these guys are great! Get your copy today!
B00063MBU8|5.0|When I found out SP was coming out with a new album I was psyched! I counted down the days, and let me tell you, this album did not disappoint. The music rocks and the lyrics are much deeper, Simple Plan is by far the greatest band to come along in a while. I listent to the CD everyday... it's like a ritual, it's that addicting. I love it.
0930289528|5.0|V for Vendetta originally appeared serialized in black and white in a British comic anthology.  Moore concludes V for Vendetta here in color with consistency.  Having written the end years later.  V for Vendetta portrays Britian as a totalitarian society with no hope for the common man. \\"V\\" is a classic anti-hero with none of the cliches which normally are associated with this genre.  I recommend this book for anyone who enjoyed Frank Miller's The Dark Night Returns.
B00063MBU8|5.0|they did it again. made a wonderful cd. they rock so much! they deserve everything and more. rock on!!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This album is amazing. Everyone can relate to the lyrics and it isn't an album where every song sounds the same. If you loved the first album, you have to go out and buy this one. I guarantee you'll love it just as much if not more. The dvd side is an added bonus full of fun footage so you can get your fix of the guys if you can't make it to a concert anytime soon.Even if you weren't a simple plan fan after the last album, go out and buy this one. I have a feeling you'll be changing your mind.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|I'll say it straight out- I'm not a jazz lover- but I heard this guy on jay leno and some other TV shows, and had to go out and this CD. What I love about him is that he doesn't only do covers, his writes his own music and lyrics, which are GREAT.  And if he does do covers he recreates them and personalizes them until they sound like he's written them. On his songwriting I hear a lot of influence by Billy Joel and Elton John. I'm 23 years old, still in college and now have all of my friends listening to this guy who seems to be breaking through all genres of music. Anyone reading this should check him out. He's gonna be around.
0312995423|3.0|I had high expectations for this book after having read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  Those expectations almost immediately faded when I recognized the same plot twists and the same type of characters as in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  The only difference is this time they are working on more modern technology.  Foreshadowing is used quite a bit as you can tell what is coming a couple of chapters ahead (with chapters of 1-2 pages it's hard not to).  As some have written previously, this book is layed out like a screenplay.  Yet again, one of the traits that I didn't like is that Dan Brown's books have somewhat lackluster endings.  You know what is going to happen due to foreshadowing and by the end when the characters are running around trying to figure out the last clue you are already thinking about what to have for dinner.  All-in-all this book was a decent read.  I would recommend it to someone who doesn't have much knowledge about computers.
B00003CX9Q|3.0|Talk about corporate greed, Hollywood is no exception. I don't want the \\"new and improved\\" version. I don't want boxed sets of movies. Speilberg and company need to learn it is better to get $15 for one great movie then not get $22.49 for two films. This goes for many other \\"versions\\" of classic films. Blade Runner, where's the original? I don't want Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom but want the other two, Ark and Crusade. These films do belong to their creators and they can do what they will with them, but give the people what they want, original versions also separately.     PLEASE
B00003CXCT|5.0|The audio & video are simply superb. The remasterization shows us very much different movies than the ones we saw decades ago. This is a must for every star wars fan. The extra DVD has a lot of info, I liked the return of Darth Vader, looks like the fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan will really kick ass!.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I saw Renee Olstead on Oprah After the Show one day when I was flicking through the channels and I couldn't believe what I heard!  She has such an amazing voice!  I've never really been too much into jazz, but this is wonderful!  I listen to this album constantly, none of the tracks are bad.  This is one of the only albums I can actually say that about!  Definately buy this one!
055350259X|5.0|I have listened to this book twice. I have just started to read it, but I think listening to it is so much better. While I struggle with words like Nothomyrmecia macrops and other tounge twisting Australian words, Bryson makes it sound like poetry. I laughed so hard listening to this book.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD has the greatest lyrics, vocals, music, everything!  If you've heard their first single 'Welcome To My Life' and you loved it, well you're going to love this cd in its entirity too.  It's amazing!  There's even a song at the end, which is Untitled, that makes you appreciate them so much more once you've heard it.  Support the band and buy the cd, it's cheap and it's also a DualDisc..cd on one side, dvd on the other.  It's a great package!
0571202284|5.0|One of those must have books for any animator! <br />You've seen all the other reviews. <br />Just go buy it.
B00005JMJG|5.0|A rich, moving tapestry that reflects how we remember our own lives, this film is as powerful as it is delicate, and as wistful as it is romantic and strong.  Carrey gives the performance of his life, and Winslet is utterly believable, beautiful, and paradoxically earthy and flighty.  But curiously it is Dunst in her supporting role who makes the point we all will remember, and Ruffalo who allows her to do it in one brief moment of lowering his head and walking away. <br /> <br />I simply couldn't recommend this film more highly for anyone who loves or dreams of love--i.e., everyone.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD is by far the best CD I've bought all year and I've shared it with my friends and they liked it so much that they went out and bought it. Simple Plan is so awesome. I love them so much. I really recommend that if you don't own this CD that you go out and buy it. You won't regret it.
1402555989|5.0|I listened to the Book on Tape. It is very well-read, and the presentation well done.<br /><br />This has to be in the top ten of my all time favorite fiction books. My heart just went out to the boy who was trying to find out who murdered his neighbor's dog - and along the way he finds out about his family.<br /><br />There are so many surprises in this book, a few times I gasped.<br /><br />The reading of the novel is done so well that you feel like you are listening to a young boy tell his story. I highly recommend the book on tape version.
B00063MBU8|5.0|well wot can i say?? The album rocks. This album is a must have this year so get it on your xmas lists now! The album is more mature and a bit more chilled out than No Pads but just like the last you cant help but keep this album on repeat. There are some great songs on this album with catchy songs like shut up and jump to the more slow songs like everytime and untitled. It rocks so GO GET IT NOW!
B00063MBU8|5.0|i think the new simple plan cd still not getting any... is a lot darker and more rock then the last cd i love it and there music seems like it has grown more  then there last ablum no pads, no helmet....just balls which is also a very good cd too i advise any one who is into pop/rock music to go out and get the simple plan cd because it is a very good cd.
B000068CNX|5.0|hi, as you know i am Lisa, i loved friends since i was 5 and didn't understand meny shows. <br />than i started to understand somethings about tv, and then friends landed in our tv. <br />i am a very very big fan of friends. <br />I love it, in all conditions. <br />in sad ways, in romantic ways and ecpecially in funny ways. <br />if anyone wants to check out the quotes and the excitement of friends line and comedic fitch? <br />plz check out my website, of [...] <br />plz visit this site. <br />
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I can't express myself as well as Gavin DeGraw, but let me say that this cd is what I refer to as  \\"a religious experience\\".  Each song just got better and better.  \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" brought tears to my eyes.  What a voice, what music, such writing skills-raw emotion!  Where has this guy been all my life?
0393057658|5.0|Hidden in baseball's past statistics is the answer to the future of baseball.  The Oakland A's have shown the way it can be done.  Now one of the guys using this same approach has gone to Boston and erased the long time curse of the Red Sox.  In a few years when the real stats that matter are used by baseball management it may not seem so important.  But right now it is. <br /> <br />Fascinating reading, and hard to believe.  Hard to believe how stuck in their ways, and how deep in the sand have been the heads of baseball management until now.  And for the most part nearly all are still stuck.  That will change as those who don't learn the new ways will not be able to compete.   <br /> <br />In a way, it strips away some of the human fallible quality that pervades baseball.  Even more so how it has been managed.  But once the genie is out of the bottle you aren't going to put it back in.  The world of baseball has changed.  Learn why and how in this book.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This Cd is so amazing, and if you don't have it yet... what are you waiting for?? its such an amazing Cd and i suggest you buy it. The lyrics are really meaningful and the instrument playing is amazing. The guys know how to keep it real, and you'll agree with me if you hear any of their songs. Catchy songs, by a talent band, what more could you ask for?
0471463396|4.0|I think some expect this to be \\"the Intelligent Investor\\" which is decidedly is not.  But for a lighter modern intro to what kind of thinking is behind value investing this book succeeds quite well.  Enough examples to get the idea across.  And written so it reads easily.  If you find yourself wanting more, then just order \\"the Intelligent Investor\\" for your next read.  <br /> <br />But this book succeeds quite well in the areas it aims to make clear.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plans' CD Still Not Getting Any... is one of the best CDs i've heard in a while.. compared to their first CD No Pads No Helmets Just Balls... their sophmore album sounds more 'grown up' and less 'poppy'.. they still have very catchy songs and their songs still rock... i can listen to this CD over and over and it will NOT get played out.. i love it.. SP definitly knows how to write good songs that actually make sense in real life..
B00008973Q|3.0|This is a good rendition of Shakespear's epic \\"King Lear\\". But the visual quality of the movie on DVD is fair or mediocre at best. First of all, the movie is not in it's original widescreen format. You can obviously tell part of the image is cut out. Also the movie looks dated, for instance it was made back in 1985 but it looks like it was made in 1970.<br /><br />The plot is a little hard to follow because the brothers look very similar and you will mistake one for the other and lady Sue & lady Kaede also look very similar. The acting also was not believable at times. The battle scenes are well done though!<br /><br />The price is a little more than what you would pay normally for a DVD movie.<br /><br />Why are foreign films always more expensive?
0060523794|4.0|One should start reading this book from chapter 27 \\"IBM- a farewell\\".<br />Here the author muses how he wished he had more time to make the connections from the old to the new.<br />I worked at IBM from 1992 through 2000 and I felt that this above failing of CEO had repercussions throughout the whole organization. IBM indeed became very successful company under his leadership but I often felt that while going after quarterly numbers we were missing the long term, big picture. We also were getting little soulless.<br /><br />Was Lou's tenure good for IBM? In the short term: yes, but in the long run, we have to resort to famous words of Zhou Enlai which he used assessing French Revolution..\\"It is too soon to say.\\"
B00006879E|1.0|How can a band have the originality of Jamiroquai? Surely copying originality would make you unoriginal and awful. Well that's what it did to Maroon 5. Possibly the worst album of all time.
B00063MBU8|5.0|OMG, STill Not Getting Any Is AWSOME. THE BEST CD IN THE WORLD, It gets me SO Excited when i hear it. I LOVE SIMPLE PLAN.
B00005JNEI|4.0|The manipulation of the time with the woman whose son went to Iraq is unfair - it was all filmed after her son died. That's  why I docked it a star. <br /> <br />Other than that... <br /> <br />The movie is fabulous. The amount of research it took to find so many clips and quotes.  <br /> <br />The movie can be summed up in one scene: Michael Moore takes his crusade to DC, where he asks Congress members and other officials who voted for the war on Iraq if they would sign their children up for the army. Most walked away in disgust. They were more than willing to vote for a war where casualties wouldn't touch them. OTHER people's children would fight, some would die. <br /> <br />The movie is powerful. Watch it with an open mind.
B00063MBU8|5.0|\\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" by Simple Plan is a must have. It's a huge step up from their first album, \\"No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls\\". The songs are catchy and fun and easy for anyone to relate to. If you're a fan of Simple Plan you have to get this album, even if you're not a fan or have never heard any of their songs. Buy it and try it out, worse comes to worse you can always give it to someone for Christmas if you don't like it!
B000002U82|4.0|This is a Pink Floyd classic album.  I would have rated it a 4 and a half, but they don't have that option.  This one was from their smoother days... lots of synthesizers and instrumentals.  With greats like Time and Money, this album definitely deserves its fame.  My one problem with it is the instrumentals every other song.  To me, this breaks up the excellence.  They had enough instrumental-ish parts in the rest of the songs that I don't think they needed all the extra full-length ones.  Other than that, this album rocks.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple plan has done it yet again! Another amazing album from these kick a$$ boyz! IF you havent heard it yet then your a loser and need to go buy it NOW! Incredible guyz! No dissapointment what so ever!
B000002J09|5.0|This album is a concentration of Zeppelin's greatest songs: <br />    -Black Dog is awesome in its a capella breaks and its sweet guitar licks (Jimmy Page is a master).  One of my personal favorites. <br />    -Rock and Roll is more fast-paced with loads of background percussion.  A good hit for cruisin down the highway. <br />    -The Battle of Evermore, sadly not on their long list of highly famous hits, is a very cool piece with a very unique sound.  Though I had never heard of it before I bought this album, it is now one of my favorites.  <br />    -Stairway to Heaven speaks for itself.   <br />    -Misty Mountain Hop is a laid-back, smooth hit.  Very cool. <br />    -Four Sticks has a funky, slightly off-kilter beat combined with softer-seeming parts mixed in.  Another classic. <br />    -Going to California is a great accoustic piece.  Gives a break from the intensity of the rest of the songs. <br />    -When the Levee Breaks has a great heavy beat.  It's a rocked-out blues hit. <br />The only other supremely essential song not on this album is Kashmir, though Zepelin also has a long list of almost-as-essential songs, all of which are covered in the 4-CD boxed set.  This would have to be the best single album they made.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Troy.  It had all the elements of a great movie:  suspense, romance, conflict, love, war, you name it. <br />The costumes were outstanding and the acting superb.  All the actors were absolutely beautiful and the quality of the acting as well.  Peter O'toole's performance was one of the bests I've ever seen and the overall message of all life emotions were so ever present. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie.  It was incredibly well made and Brad Pitt was absolutely gorgeous!
6305127697|3.0|I was disappointed because I'd read so many 5* reviews here on Amazon before seeing the movie, but come on, the best ending ever?!?!? <br /> <br />God help you people, I suppose you couldn't work out what would happen in Gothika either? & I bet you struggle to imagine what happens at the end of 'Sleeping Beauty' as well! <br /> <br />Anyway, that said, the acting is great, there's no finer actor around than Edward Norton & if I hadn't taken so much notice of all the hype about how amazing this film is then I probably would've given it 4* because of the acting performances. <br /> <br />But that ending? I saw it coming most of the movie. Not as quicly as Gothika mind you, I worked out the ending of that movie about 10 minutes in!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Hey fans! This cd is totally awesome, if you don't already own it, you should definately grab a copy! It's an awesome cd with awesome lyrics. If you're into pop punk, this is a must have to add to your music collection! GRAB A COPY A.S.A.P!!!!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This Tim Burton film is not just a movie but a piece of art. Big Fish was directed with such creativity and imagination. Tim Burton inquires an outstanding cast includisng Ewan McGregor(Star Wars I,II,Pillowbook); Albert Finney(Scrooge,Saturday Night and Sunday morning); Billy Crudup (Grind,Almost Famous)and Jessica Lange (Frances,Sweet Dreams). Most Drectors if lucky wait their entire career to hit it big with their masterpiece, and Big Fish was Tim Burton's masterpiece. The only movie that could compare with such inginuity and vision would be \\"The Wizard of OZ\\" directed by Richard Thorpe and King Vidor. <br /> <br />Why should you see this movie? <br />After watching this movie you might find yourself overloaded with information, like you just got done reading a 200 page book. why im i telling you this,because it is what i experienced. this does not mean that it is a boring movie, it is not, in fact it is a roller coaster. it may take a day or two for your brain to process the movie into understanding it better, when that happens you will realize the magnitude and joy this movie brings. My recommendation for this movie is to go out and buy it, because a movie like this comes around only once in a childhood
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's new CD Still Not Getting Any... is the best CD out there for teens. The lyrics in the songs really relate to what some teens feel. Most of the songs remind me of myself and my friends (one even about my ex-friend). I really think you should buy this CD and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Oh my, I love this CD.  It is aweosme!  It's a lot like their first CD in a way... but it's also so different.  I love DVD part that is on the back of the CD, it's so funny!  I think that 'Untitled', 'Crazy', and 'One' are my three favorites!  Everyone should for sure go out and by this CD!  I've seen Simple Plan three times in concert, and the last time was at Warped Tour 2004, and they sang 'Shut Up'(from this new CD)... but I can't wait till I get to see them again when they sing more songs from the new album!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I LOVED IT!!! AND WELL...I STILL LOVE IT!!! :D :D :D it totally deserves 5 stars WOOO HOOOO no 10 stars lol i dont know but i suggest you go and buy it if you dont have it yet!!!! GO ON What are you doing still reading this you should be going to buy it lol  yea its that good! :D well thats it for now
B0002KVUKM|4.0|When one watches \\"Van Helsing,\\" one experiences an adrenaline rush as if riding a roller coaster or bungee jumping off a high bridge! The action sequences are breathtaking, and those are the best things about the movie. The story, sad to say, borrows everything from old horror stories like \\"Dracula,\\" \\"Frankenstein,\\" \\"The Wolf Man,\\" and \\"Jekyll and Hyde.\\" But the plotline is more similar to the many James Bond adventures, especially the fact that Van Helsing (a \\"Bond-ish\\" performance by Hugh Jackman) works for a secret agency run by the Vatican assigned to take out monsters, complete with a Q-like Monk named Carl (David Wenham of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fame) and an M-like Cardinal. The cast do what they can in the film, with Kate Beckinsale (be she ever so fine) giving the film's best performance. The story is unoriginal, but when the action sequences occur, \\"Van Helsing\\" is one wild ride!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+
B000002GYI|5.0|While Autobahn and Tour de France (1983) are probably 2 of their best singles they were never released as a \\"full-length album\\".  Computer World is by far their best \\"full-length album\\" of all time.  When listening to it just remember it's 1981 and you'll see what I mean.  It's an electronic masterpiece and a must have for anyone seeking to experience Kraftwerk at their best. Numbers is the best single here.  I'm still \\"wowed\\" when I listen to it.  Buy this CD and I can guarantee you will be \\"wowed\\" as well.
B00063MBU8|5.0|For all the people who loved simple plan's first cd,this is the cd to get!It is like 5 times beter then there first cd.The songs are great and i like the cd graphics.I hope all you fans get this cd,i allredy have it.bye!
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card has quite a way with characters. This statement is best proven by Ender's Game, a novel about growth and internal conflict.  <br /> <br />The world has suffered two invasions by aliens and barely survived. To prevent further attack, the nations of the world have allied together and created a base in outer space where they train super children to be the master soldiers. <br /> <br />Ender Wiggin is one such child who is selected to work on this base and immediately separates himself as one of the best among the best. The commanders see the boy's immense potential and separate him from the rest of the group to see how he fares.  <br /> <br />The novel carries several sub plots including the events occuring on earth, the mind game played by the children, and Ender's conflict with Bonzo. Each sub plot is captivating and adds depth to the story as a whole. <br /> <br />While the story is an exciting one, the novel's strongest point is the character of Ender. Even though he is the best of the best, Ender is rarely happy. He feels he has no friends, and hates the monster he is becoming. The way Ender constantly clashes with his personality offers an interesting approach to the typical protagonist as he hates himself.  <br /> <br />One flaw that I found with the novel was the fact that Bonzo was such a static character. Many of the characters evolved throughout the story (Peter, Valentine, Ender) and yet Bonzo was constantly just a raging heathen who was full of pride.  <br /> <br />Plus, I would have loved to have more battle details. The battle room was an exciting part of the book (the children would form armies and wage wars with one another) and I would have loved for more battles to have been covered. <br /> <br />Overall, the novel is excellent and I'd recommend it to anyone. I've read it 6 times and I don't think I've read it enough.
B00005NB8K|4.0|In 1991 director Oliver Stone made two epics concerning the 1960s, \\"JFK\\" and \\"The Doors\\".  In my humble opinion, Stone was most successful with \\"The Doors\\" in evoking the spirit of that tumultuous time in American history.  You can feel and taste the ambiance of the Sunset Strip and the smoky clubs that the Doors used as their stomping grounds.  But who's kidding who; the Doors were a vehicle for the musings of their charasmatic leader, Jim Morrison, and the rest of the band were able sidemen.  Val Kilmer so eerily channels the spirit of Morrison in his performance here that you feel that you are actually witnessing the rise and downward spiral of the Lizard King himself.  The cast here includes many talented individuals(Meg Ryan, Kyle Maclachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon) but essentially they are but straight men to the Morrison show.  The reason I rate this film four stars instead of five is indicative of the fact that this is ultimately not an easy film to watch.  It's something of a chore to witness the self-destruction of a talented individual through his own narcissistic indulgences.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film is extremely interesting . Filmed in kinetic documental style , the picture denounces delicate , unknown and powerful facts involved in the Circles of the Power .<br />To my mind the film has peaks an lows ; the recruiting process left me with a very bitter taste because I expected Moore was far beyond in this premise .<br />In the other hand , the crucial events such the secret connections between the Petroleum affairs and the implications which carried to the all most known of 1973 event ; the impact and relation between the necessity of creating war stages and its hidden implications in the Financial World are issues which concerns not only to USA but the rest of the globe . The memory is too fragile and sometimes you need explain certain issues you consider totally fixed .<br />There are many touching moments a bit overlong in the film and in the other hand there are extremely smart moments too short as that one close to end in which Moore requires to one of the Members of Senate for requesting one of his sons to join the Iraq conflict.<br />The environment question was out . The burning Oil fields  after the Gulf War has been one of the most unforgiven and criminal acts in the recent story , the Alaska project and the final destiny of the wasted nuclear material could have been another winner points.<br />May be the documental style has its own rules but I would like to know the position of some other high personalities such Tony Blair,  Jacques Chirac, Aznar , Clinton, Kissinger among others or Peace Nobel winners about this intriguing and delicate web of hidden issues which we will never reach to know in the time of our lives due the simple fact are classified information.<br />Anyway a brave and well received film in the rest of the world -Winner in Cannes 2004- which leaves you as must be with more questions than answers due its unexhausted and arresting lines .
0792843584|4.0|I viewed \\"Heaven's Gate\\" with a sense of morbid curiousity.  I was well aware of the film's notoriety as the film that brought down a studio, United Artists, and I wanted to see how bad or self-indulgent a mess it had to be.  To my pleasant surprise, this is not a bad picture.  The film is not without faults, such as it's overlength and an occassionally muddled script.  Aside from that, it was an engaging picture and I definitely would not call it boring.  It brought to mind, at least to me, Sergio Leone's \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" but without that film's flair or larger than life characters.  The acting here was generally good, though John Hurt's character's presence here puzzled me(what's a besotted Brit doing in the middle of the wild west?).  The technical attributes of this film were outstanding particular mention going to David Mansfield's terrific score and Vilmos Zsigmond's breathtaking cinematography.  One should definitely view this film divorced from it's reputation and see it for what it is; a very good film.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is one of the best albums that I have ever bought! The guitar riffs are beautiful and the songs are the greatest!
B00003CX97|5.0|The makers of today's action films should take a page from the makers of \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\".  You don't have to pander to your audiences basest instincts to make a great action film.  This film contains great action set-pieces, great acting (Alec Guiness, William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Essaye Hayakawa) and great conflicts between the characters.  Director David Lean was at the top of his game when he made this film.  Though the cast is uniformly excellent special note should be made about the characters played by Alec Guiness and Essaye Hayakawa.  These are extremely complex individuals.  Assumptions about the likability and nobility of their characters are turned on their head through the course of this film.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Alright, so being the huge Simple PLan fan that I am I am not surprised at all that I absolutely love the C.D. They music is awesome and the lyrics are something else...in a good way. The guys write about their experiences and how they feel about things, and just sharing that with us takes balls. On this C.D. there were a few songs that really \\"spoke\\" to me. #3 on the album, Perfect World is just awesome. The words make so much sense, \\"In a perfect world, this could never happen, in a perfect world you'd still be here, and it makes no sense, I could just pick up the pieces, but to you, this means nothing, nothing at all\\". Whether you broke up with a boyfriend or girlfriend, whether someone close to you passed away or if something unfortunate happened this is the song to listen to. Next is #10 \\"One\\" This song is about todays youth, the impact they have on todays society--more specifically today's adults and how they appear to be, but are NOT forgotten. It also shows how todays' youth are and why they can become so powerful, they are one. \\"We are...we are the ones, the ones forgotten, and this time, the future is ours, it's in our hands, we are one.\\" Finally, is #11, the albums last song \\"Untitled.\\" This song is in a league of its own. It is something a bit different from the guys, but is without a doubt incredible. I'm not going to say anything about this song, because of how powerful it is, but I will leave you with its chorus, oh and one more thing, if you have not yet purchased the C.D., I suggest you do so, it is an extreemly good investment, one I can assure you you will not regret making. Now the chorus: \\"How could this happen to me; I made my mistakes; I've got no where to run; The night goes on; As I'm fading away; I'm sick of this life; I'm ready to scream; How could this happen to me...\\"
B00005K3LU|5.0|This is a popcorn movie with smarts.  It's got everything you want in a good action flick; an average guy hero, charismatic(yet sadistic) villains, dumb beaureaucrats, and things blow up real good.  Bruce Willis established himself as a film star after his stint on \\"Moonlighting\\" and Alan Rickman introduced himself to audiences as an actor to be reckoned with.  The beauty of this movie is it's total lack of pretense outside of entertaining the audience.  Today's action film-makers can take a cue from this film.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This soundtrack is incredible. From the first song on the CD your toes are tapping and your head is into the plot. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zelweger are fantastic and so full of life and command so much attention. You feel the songs all the way deep into your soul. This soundtrack blows the actual play out of the water. Moving, exuberant and sexy! Loved it, listen to it every day. If you like musicals and jazz, this soundtrack is for you!

B00009V7RF|4.0|Elephunk...I picked this CD up from a friend as \\"driving music\\" when I was driving across the country. To my surprise there was something very heartfelt and very honest about their music. There was a truth and blatant goofyness to their songs that hit home to me. The beats are enormous. Every song had me moving and shaking, I liked EVERY song on it, which is unusual. The musicianship is outstanding, such a talented and diverse group. Mixtures of Latin, hip hop, reggae and pop make for a fun and funky sound. Love it, I think everyone can enjoy this CD
B000003TB6|5.0|As a man who loves good music i love the Roots. In my opinion their best release to date, Do You Want More?!!!??! displays the neccessary components of a fresh hip hop album. Versatile beats, funky drops, all of which compliment the ever poetic Black Thought show this groups versatility. Number of samples used in this album=0.Number of times this cd will make you say- Wow,this is ahead of its time=130,323,234
B000002KAT|5.0|This is an especially rare type of album, that not only fits in perfectly with the autumn season (it virtually embodies it) but it also has all of the timeless autumnal themes: recollection, regret, remembrance.  This album conjures a timeless nostalgia within me (inspiring my own vague childhood memories) with its remarkable musical complexity (an achingly beautiful melding of folk, jazz, classical, and Van the Man's bluesy vocals which were at a supernatural height here and never reached this level again).  The greatest singer/songwriter album, eclipsing even Dylan...Van Morrison's trip down memory lane is filled with deeply emotional improvisational lyrics, impressionistic and mystical imagery, and pure soul.  Accompanying the greatest vocals to grace any album in the history of popular music are one of the greatest jazz rhythm sections and a string quartet.  The most personal album ever made.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This album is some what different from their first one, it seems to be more mature and that just shows that they are able to do so much more than most bands could ever do!!  It's totally worth it!! Simple plan kicks major a**!! Its not worth five stars it's worth 100 stars!!!!       Kat
B00063MBU8|5.0|a totally matured simple plan with the same catchy tunes but more serious lyrics .... still not getting any rocks!!! it is on of the best albums i have ever bought (along with thier first album no pads no helmets just balls). this is money WELL spent trust me . u need to get this album ... plus it includes a cool dvd with it!!! so go get it , it is the best!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|simpleplan's new album Still Not Getting Any is awesome cd <br />i love it , it rocks and all the songs are good my faveourite song is shut up.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This album is amazing from start to finish. they have progressed as artists and the result is astonishing. i can relate to every song on so many levels. there are very few cd's like that, for me. it gives you a little bit of everything. you have to punk rock sounds of the old simple plan, then you have very deep and heart felt lyrics mixed in with amazing instrumentals. and they finish it off with a beautiful piano and string song that literally makes me cry everytime i hear it. i would definitely recommend this album to anyone and everyone. it is truly one of those great ones.
B00006RU5B|1.0|no good, nothing special exept a normal rock band. nothing else. this cannot replace rage and will never. Rage Against The Machine needs to reform now!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I LOVE this CD I am in the invasion crew and when i listened to it, I was totally excited! I am obsessed with simple plan, and this CD can really relate to my life and my problems, like i deticated \\"perfect world\\" to one of my best friends Nate who died on aug. 21 2004, RIP i love you nate!! It meant so much to me!!! You should really go out and buy the CD!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I got the dualdisc version of Simple Plan.  Let me tell you, that it is awesome.  I've listened to this cd continously.  Every single person can relate to each and every song on the album.  I can't say which song is my favorite because they all are.  I usually don't say that about most cd's I get, but I can honestly tell you that everything about this cd is awesome.  The DVD is also awesome too.  You get extra features and many other awesome things. SO GO OUT AND GET THE SIMPLE PLAN ALBUM TODAY!!!  You won't regret it.  :)
B0000029DD|5.0|I too would like to have Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" with me if I was stranded on a desert island! \\"Grace\\", along with the Beatles White Album and \\"Eric Clapton Unplugged\\", would be all the music I would ever need. Really folks, it's *that* good. BELIEVE the hype! The cover of \\"Hallelujah\\" and the title track are probably the best known tracks from this album but there's some other gems as well. See \\"Eternal Life\\" (which got a lot of radio airplay in the mid-90's) and the haunting \\"Last Goodbye.\\" <br />Like the late Elliot Smith, Buckley felt too much pain for one human being to endure. And it comes across on this record. You can hear his voice crack with emotion on \\"Hallelujah\\". It's quite simply one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded by anybody. Like Elliot Smith, Jeff left us too soon. As the music business becomes more and more commercialized and popular music seems more bland and contrived every week (what's next? is Jessica Simpsons' manicurist's neighbors gardner going to record an album?) I will forever be grateful to Jeff for recording such a poignant and meaningful album. The people who trash it really have a lot of time on their hands and/or a really large chip on their shoulders. Wherever you are now Jeff, thank you.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Omg, I love this movie soooo much! It's my fav movie of all time, I am totally obsessed with this movie. I think my favorite thing about this movie is the romance between Peter Pan and Wendy (I wish they ended up together) and the fact that they can go to Neverland and don't want to grow up. This movie really made me not want to grow up. I'm 15, and I sooo don't want to grow up because it just gets worse (like school) from this age. Gotta watch this movie!!
B000641Z90|5.0|I just purchased the First Farewell Tour DVD. It is the best one so far! I was at his concert in Paris when this was filmed so it's a special treat. For all \\"Phil fans\\" this is a must. You get the complete concert plus all sorts of extras- total viewing time: almost 6 hours. Definitely a great buy!  <br />I sure hope he comes back some day...but in the mean time  <br />Phil Collins is at his best- in my living room. <br />\\"WE\\" can't stop loving you...
B00063MBU8|5.0|The 2nd album, by a band is normanlly the worst. But Simple Plan, has made their 2nd better then the first. Each song different from the previous. Tbis CD has been in my car since it first came out, and i still can't stop listening to it. This CD is one of the best CD's i have in my collection, and i have 100's. IF your only going to get one CD, this should be it. It will not be a waste of your money. I have 3 words for you: BUY THIS CD.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I thought these guys had the cat by the tail with the first CD. but this one is totally incredible. I can't believe how their music has 'grown'...showing so much insight and, mostly, EMOTION! They have a little bit of something for everyone here. Congratulations to Simple Plan for a job very well done!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I think that, hold on let me rephrase that, I KNOW THAT this album is GREAT!!!!!!! all of the music great and very touching, especially Welcome to My Life, track #2, and Perfect World, track #3! With the combination of Pierre's voice, Chuck's drum skills, and Seb, David and Jeff's guitar skills, makes an UNDEFEATABLEY AWESOME ROCK BAND!!!!!! this album is definitely 5 stars but i in my heart, its a 10.....times 10.....times 10 star rated album! Still Not Getting Any is by far the best of Simple Plan's albums and is definitely worth owning, and will not be a waste of your money unlike some other albums that people by, like britney spears or weird pop music. SPEAKING AS A TRUE S.P. AT HEART, THE ALBUM IS GR8 AND IT WORTHWHILE HAVING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />if you do not yet have it......WUT R U WAITIN 4?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!........................GOOOOO GETT ITTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|wow i didn't know it was possible to make an album better than their first CD, but this entire cd ROCKS!!!! I think my favorite song on it is \\"Perfect World.\\" They are an amazing band and really really nice guys!! Make sure and check them out LIVE cuz they put on one heck of a show!!!!
B00063MBU8|4.0|I highly recommand this CD/DVD package for any music lover. Simple Plan has done it again with \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\", over doing themselves with songs like \\"Crazy\\", \\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Shut Up\\". The lyrics are sincerce and meaningful. The guitar/bass textures and tones show that they have evoulved from \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\". The song \\"Untitled\\", is a combination between the old Simple Plan and the new Simple Plan, and in my opinion the perfect way to end the CD off.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|i wouldn't had bet on this new nightwish release but put aside Tuomas childish epic universe -&gt; you have a solid album here. I use to think emppu's guitar work sucked (in this one he kind of suprised me).Jukka's drumming is not present (this guy got infinite talent!USE IT!).Tarja your pretty:(I want you bad ;0).<BR>Overall,Nightwish's sweatest oeuvre.They can be recognized as musicians.
0064440346|5.0|We have a lot of children's books at home.  This is undoubtedly one of the finest.  The praise heaped upon it by the other reviewers is merited.  What is, indeed, a shame is that Lobel did not write more in this vein.
B000002I6T|5.0|\\"A music fan\\" (May 29, 2003) wondered about the first voice heard on this wonderful album ... admittedly I wasn't there when it was recorded, but my ears tell me definitively that it's Crosby singing in his gorgeous falsetto. Young comes in the second time around at 00:57. <br /> <br />Anyway, I've loved this album since its release, one of my all-time favorites. Just so damn beautiful.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This has got to be one of Disney's best.  My kids watch it in batches, and I am astounded at the experimentation and the layers of the experience.  Music has, in part through this film, entered their souls.  I am never bored by this film and neither are they.  It is the ultimate edutainment and it is pioneering as well.<br /><br />Get it!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Dear Abby, <br /> <br />Is Britney Really In The Zone? I doubt it. She might be near the zone or even above the zone. But in the zone is streching the trueth. You have to admit she's not the best singer but she takes you can see her emulating J.Lo. (also no in the zone). Both off them have married several times in the last few years. Britney married Jason Alexander, who was great in Seinfled and those fried food commercials, but he to is not in the zone. I dont believe a singer/actor/dancer could be in the zone but i believe they could be pretty darn close to in the zone. Or is the Zone a state of mind more then a place. Can Anyone be in the zone. <br /> <br />                                          <br /> <br /> <br />                                              From, <br />                                           ZONEing out in USA <br /> <br />
B00005JKC3|2.0|Following the path created by Spiderman, X-Men, and even Daredevil (as bad as that was), Hulk jumps into the theaters at a time when Comic Book movies have become extremely popular. One of the reasons that Spiderman and the two X-Men films were so popular is that they didn't take themselves too seriously. They were a lot of fun with their over the top villains, incredible effects, and characters that we could all relate to in some way. Well, with the Hulk, Ang Lee decided to ditch that formula altogether. He has created a dull, drab, BORING comic book movie with mediocre effects and actors that are trying way too hard to create characters that we just don't care about. <br /> <br />Speaking of characters we just don't care about... Eric Bana's Bruce Banner just happens to be one of the most stale characters I've seen in modern cinema. The only thing I can relate to is that neither he nor I can successfully carry a movie... well I've never really tried. I think it's time for introductions: \\"Made for TV\\", this is Eric Bana.... Eric Bana, this is your future.... As bad as the CG Hulk was (and he was bad), the CG Hulk was much more personable than Bruce Banner. It's bad when your computer generated non speaking mediocre effect driven alter ego is better in the film than you are. Sorry, Bana... <br /> <br />Now for the rest of the cast. As much as I dislike Nick Nolte, he did have a few good moments. Too bad the rest of his over the top antics seem forced. As for his appearance.... I'm pretty sure he went straight from his DUI arrest to the set. <br /> <br />Then there is the lovely Jennifer Connelly. Why was she in this movie? I'm guessing to give the film some sort of credibility. She did make the movie less excruciating to watch, but she was really wasted in this role, and she really had nothing to work with. <br /> <br />A couple positive notes: I enjoyed Sam Elliot in this film, even though he is playing the same character he plays in other movies. He was entertaining to watch. I also enjoyed watching Josh Lucas from Sweet Home Alabama. Sure he's a poor man's Matthew McConaughey, but he still brought flare to his small part that was very much needed in this bore. <br /> <br />Now for the CG hulk. At times, the Hulk looks ok, but most of the time he looks like he was ripped out of the video game and superimposed over the appropriate frames. The film makers had to realize that the success of their film relied on the success of the computer generated Hulk. I wholeheartedly believe that once they saw how unsuccessful their Shrek-like creation was ( DONKEY !! ), they decided to showcase the Hulk to a lesser degree which is why we are forced to endure the excruciatingly slow first act. The entire first hour is full of back story and 'plot' that really makes the film drag. We didn't pay 8 bucks to catch up on some overly complex plot that would have been better served as a voice over narration during the opening credits. We paid the money to simply see the hulk cause havoc. And eventually he does just that. There were enjoyable moments where the Hulk gets to cause mass destruction and these are the moments that I remember most fondly (besides the closing credits when I got to leave ). These moments are few and far between, but they are fun though unoriginal. <br /> <br />There a few scenes which really bothered me. Firstly, there are moments when the hulk is jumping across the desert with each leap seemingly covering miles. It was as if he were flying across the land. Yes, Ang Lee. I saw crouching tiger... get over it. The other scene that bothered me worse than anything is truly inexplicable. It happens about 20 minutes after they should have ended the movie and it involves Nick Nolte's huge electrical beast (don't ask ) trying to suck the green out of the Hulk (I'm serious). Somehow they become some huge amoeba type mass of energy and I really have no idea why or how. It was at that moment that I realized the movie just kept getting dumber and dumber. Each minute was worse than the previous, so at any given moment I was watching the worst part of the movie. <br /> <br />One thing I feel Ang Lee did well was to use some comic book stylized transitions between scenes. There were some really nice transition effects using different frames ( ala 24 ), that really gave the movie some much need personality and style. Well done. I would like to see some of the other comic book films implement similar transitions in the onslaught of comic sequels headed our way. <br /> <br />In conclusion... yawn. <br /> <br />mastercritic.com
B00063MBU8|5.0|This cd totally rocks and I would recommend it to everyone. The DVD side is full of cool extras and the songs are so true. If you dont have it already, you should get it.
0930289528|5.0|The next time someone tells you that Watchmen is the greatest Alan Moore comic (if not greatest comic, period) of all time...walk away and purchase a copy of V instead.  You'll be glad you did.  Remember: \\"without rulers\\", not \\"without order.\\"
B000089CJI|3.0|My feelings about this album approach the very definition of paradox.  I find the music itself dull and rather arrogant in its simplicity.  The lyrics are dry and loveable.  The songs on this album feel like back up songs for recent Death Cab album.  The songs just didn't have enough concrete imagery...\\"well since their already outlined we'll just make a side project.\\" It's really odd..I don't undestand this \\"resurgance\\" of Indie Pop, I'd rather the Cure put out an album in line with Killing and Arab, but that won't ever happen. The Postal Service.. I must admit it's great for soothing my 8 week old son, but it just makes me want to scoop out my heart with cracking fingernails..it's just that loveable and poppy. It's particularly odd really, I don't like this band but for some reason I just can't stop playing it.  Damn the Pop gods!!  I think i'm going to mix this CD with a Godspeed's newest album.. maybe that will satisfy my \\"whatever\\" mood..
B00063MBU8|5.0|Just when you think simple plan's music coulnd't get any better.... there's still not getting any. <br />The last album still brings huge smiles to my face , double that with the smiles i get from \\"still not getting any\\" and you have some weird smiling freak. The music has definitly evolved since the last album , tho when you see the album pictures you can see they're still the same old simple plan *dorks* but hey, all in a good way ofcourse. To pick a favorite song is something that's nearly impossible to do, i can honestly say each and every one of the songs touched my heart and stayed in my mind, to make me cry, to make me lauch, to make me think back to the past... It's very touching music to, and that's something only possible if you're listening to music's best out there... <br />So if you were thinking about buying the album, you'd do best to do so, it's probably the best album to buy this year <br />and while you're at it, check out [...] <br />peace
B00063MBU8|5.0|simple plan's album still not getting any is their best album yet. It has dvd featurs on it and I thought that that was a wonderful idea to have a dvd on the back of the cd. I love simple plan and I loved this album ecspecialy the song crazy. If you like simple plan you should buy this album.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Check your brain and enjoy the effects.  <br /> I love how the nerd in the library fixing the radio tells off the cop who asks him if he should find some help with it, \\"I'm the president of the math club, the science club, and the chess club, so please, if you can find a bigger nerd than me, let me know.\\"  ha!  <br />Anyway, the movie's not realistic and it makes fun of itself by creating these ironic situations-like everyone evacuating to Mexico.   <br />As far as the message goes, I'm glad it's there... cause you have to admit, we really don't take good care of our environment.  Although it's probably not going to happen overnight, the ice-caps have melted a heck of a lot, and will continue to melt because of the things we do.  Long term effects... who knows?  It'll probably be gradual, but one day it'll come back to bite humanity- probably long after all the people who put us in the predicament have passed away.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I have been a Simple Plan fan for a long time now, I absolutly love No Pads, No Helmets, just Balls. I was very excited for there new cd to come out. It seems like I waited forever. I got Still Not Getting Any the day it came out and it was well worth the wait. The lyrics are touching, and you can tell they have matured more as a band. This is just an awesome cd that I highly reccomend everyone buy.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I've waited for Simple Plan's sophomore album for months, and when I bought it, it really blew my mind.  It shown me the guys matured since their previous album, No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls. The lyrics are darker and more stronger, and it has great guiter riffs.  Crazy and Untitled would have to be the most strongest on the album.  Crazy reflects a society gone completed wrong, while Untitled brings up suicide.  However, Untitled is one of the most beautifully written songs I ever heard.  The video for Welcome To My Life is remarkable, and the song talks about alienation.  Pierre's voice isn't annoying, and it's a whole better than Enimem.  I'm not a teenager anymore, I'm twenty years old, but I like music with iron perspectives, and Still Not Getting Any has that.  I'm completely thrilled with the album.  It deeply shows how talented Simple Plan is.
B000002I6T|5.0|If you're into CSN, Neil Young and/or the Dead, don't miss this one.  What I've heard of Crosby's other post CSN and CSN&Y work has been pretty uneven, but this has a nice consistent feel from beginning to end.  An amazing lineup of musicians from all the big psychedelic hippie bands of the 60s.  Recorded at the tail end of the biggest cultural revolution in U.S. history, it captures the lingering discontent with an ongoing political climate of war mongering.  The album continues to be relevant more than 30 years later for bands like Wilco, who are carrying on the torch musically, while also trying to fight the current, amazingly similar political climate.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I loved this album. It can actually become addictive! The DVD and special features are awesome. You see a side of the band you may not have seen before. The songs are are great and this is an album you will listen to over and over again!
B00005NRO3|5.0|This is probably the best film from the Scream trilogy.  And yes, I've read the reviews claiming that it doesn't even partially measure up to the first.  However, this movie has a lot to offer - including a great cast - going through and watching this movie now - you see a ton of actors that have small bit roles - but are now big name stars - ex: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Portia de Rossi, Heather Graham, and Omar Epps.  Anyways, I love how this film plays on mapping out the faults of the horror genre - and pokes fun while at the same time scaring the crap out of you.  Plus, with this film, I felt a lot more character development - and I think this film served to genuinely 'scare' me more than the original Scream - the first one really just made me whince at how gory it became.
080018789X|5.0|I have to say that Jerry Maguire is one of the best performances by Tom Cruise.  He is so emotionally vulnerable as Jerry Maguire that everyone is completely relating to him.   <br /> <br />Everyone sort of has this idea of sending out a memo to your colleagues to indicate what an ideal work life should be, however, when the reality hits about the memo and the people at the office are thinking what has he been smoking, then Jerry realizes that he is losing it.  When he gets fired by one of his underlings played wonderfully by Jay Mohr, then you know that you are on a wonderful emotional roller coaster called life with Jerry. <br /> <br />Cameron Crowe does a wonderful job of directing Cruise through the evolving process of his character.  Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., Regina King, Bonnie Hunt, Kelly Preston and Jonathan Lipnicki definitely make the movie even better as they guide Jerry through the difficult process of life. <br /> <br />Zellweger is great when she packs up her stuff and decides to follow Jerry into the unknown.  Gooding Jr. is great when he tells Jerry that he is the ambassador of \\"kwan\\".  Lipnicki is adorable as Jerry's new close little friend as Zellweger's son. <br /> <br />I could go on about how this movie is the evolving character of a man who has a problem with an intimate relationship, but with a little help from his friend(Gooding Jr.), he realizes that the best thing in life is a truly committed intimate relationship.  One of the better realizations about this movie. <br /> <br />If you like Crowe, Cruise, Zellweger, Gooding Jr., then you will have a great time seeing Jerry Maguire.  I have forgotten how many times that I have seen it, and it will always be one of the better movies that I have seen.
B00003CX9E|5.0|So very much has been written on this movie over the years that it might be superfluous to add any more words to the reams of articles and reviews.  But this is a wonderful movie.  It is not perfect, by any means.  But Welles, and the very tender age of 25, managed to turn out an extraordinary gem, radical for its time with its use of deep focus, flashback editing, and unique camera angles.  Pauline Kael, who wrote a wonderful book on this film, once called \\"Citizen Kane\\" a shallow masterpiece.  This may be a weakness, in that it may not offer all the intellectual fodder of Fellini's \\"8 1/2,\\" but it is also a strength.  For few films in the history of cinema have managed to offer substantive creativity and thoroughly enjoyable content, both at the same time.  It is the one masterpiece I actually have fun watching.  I hope you find it to be the same.
0345350499|2.0|Maybe I'm just not a King Arthur fan, but I thought this book was horrible! I didn't enjoy reading this book one bit, but I did finnish it. I have to admit that the end was excelent and I couldn't have written a better ending myself, but the rest of the book was rambling and boring! I couldn't find which way was what, half the time I didn't know what I was reading!!! Not to say this book was all bad, because there where parts in this book that really touched me. Other than that I found this book a real bore! <br />Out of 873 pages, 3 quarters of this book made any sense!!!! Excpet for the end, I found this book a real waste of time to read.
B00005LQ04|5.0|It's always interesting to me to hear people explain why they don't like Argento's movies.  I've seen most of them at this point, and although a few of them aren't that special, the majority are at the very least excellent additions to the horror canon. <br /> <br />The defense of Argento you're most likely to hear is that the movies don't NEED to make perfect sense.  What Argento has done is to create an atmosphere that is more dreamlike than grounded in reality.  In that sense, they definitely have a more nightmarish feel than most horror movies, which tend to be bland, formulaic, or beholden to useless exposition. <br /> <br />Argento appeals to raw sensuality, primal fear, and the unsettling feeling of un-reality.  And Suspiria is probably his most effective movie in this sense.  The American prints of his movies have always been re-edited, cut, and underbaked.  Anchor Bay has fixed this with their stunning series of Argento movies.  Seeing this version of Suspiria was like seeing it for the first time.  The color schemes are gorgeous, saturared, and haunting.  The print is crisp.  And perhaps most importantly, we can finally see the movie the way it was meant to be seen. <br /> <br />If you just can't turn off that analytic instinct when you watch his movies, maybe they just aren't for you.  But if you want to take in an incredibly atmospheric horror film that plays with basic horror elements to produce something imaginative, strange and terrifying, then this is a must see.  The movies DO make sense-- perfect sense, in fact.  It just might not become clear on the first viewing.  Like a bad dream, it can be loosely structured.  But still plenty scary. <br /> <br />Fans are likely to rank Argento's movies in very different order, but Deep Red and Opera would probably rank pretty high on most people's lists, and I really enjoyed Phenomena and Tenebre as well.  All of these are available from Anchor Bay.  A lot of folks tend to write off Trauma, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Even the new Sleepless is worth seeing, but I went with the European version-- the American release does the usual job of re-editing, cutting and re-formatting Argento's original film.  When will it end?
B00005B36H|5.0|Just as a note, all the people that say that this sucks are the same people that think that anarchy is a good thing that could actually work and that Benji from Good Charlotte should lead the revolution. What I am basically saying is that they are stupid. Tool is a very mature and different sounding genre of rock that seems to escape alot of people. Don't listen to these fools, Tool's sound can be very refreshing and invigorating, if you let it in and don't expect it to follow the mainstream style of \\"rock\\", like LinkinPark, the worst excuse for a band in history. So give it a chance and bask in the ambience that is Tool... God I hate Good Charlotte... and LinkinPark for that matter... no dice.
B00005YXZH|5.0|<br /> <br /> <br />     In one of my music classes at Loyola University, New Orleans, my professor simply defined art as \\"That which deserves a second look.\\" Your first perception of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot maybe that it's a cluttered mess; but if you give the album time to grow on you, it should become an instant favorite. <br /> <br />     Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is an album heavily caked in symbolism. The title of the album itself is a common trio of radio call words. The album's warm folk cuts through layers of cacophony like an S.O.S., the work of a man lost in the 21rst century. <br /> <br /> The noise isn't just random though; it is used as a dynamic device, waxing and waning like through song structures. I can honestly say I'd never heard a crescendo of feedback, cello, radio static, synthesize and xylophone until I'd heard Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. This is an inventive original album.  <br /> <br />     Song by Song analysis: <br /> <br />1. I Am Trying To Break You're Heart: (10/10) <br />   <br />   This is possibly Wilco's master work; opening with a swelling of cacophony over a stead light drum beat, Jeff Tweedy sounds like a man just roused from a dream, and realizing he's surrounded by unfamiliar people and things.  <br /> <br />   The song teases a typical Wilco build up to a bombastic chorus that never comes; Towards the 5 minute mark it corrodes into spasms of feedback as an alarm clock jangles and xylophone lines fall like rain drops a Chicago street. This song alone is worth the asking price. <br /> <br /> <br />2.Kamera (9/10) <br /> <br />   Kamera comes a long like a some what robotic take on the country-folk rock that made Wilco (semi)-famous. It sounds like Kraftwerk doing a Graham Parsons cover. It manages to be catchy enough to stick in your head, but detached enough to continue the ambience of the album. <br />   <br />3. \\"Radio Cure\\" (9/10) <br /> <br />   A folky ballad reminiscent of something off The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, \\"Radio Cure\\" a synthesizer gently pulses, like a wave hitting the side of a beach.  Although not nearly as effecting as some of the heavyweight pieces on this album, \\"Radio Cure\\" still holds it's own.  <br /> <br />4. \\"War on War\\" (10/10) <br /> <br /> One of the few songs that recalls the \\"easy rockers\\" of Wilco's previous albums, \\"War on War\\" is structured around a driving, undeniably catchy hook.  The big country rock twang is eventually joined by a synthesizer and some dissonant piano notes, which bring the track careening too an end, a tail of feedback wiggling at the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />5. \\"Jesus Etc.\\" (10/10) <br /> <br /> Words don't describe how beautiful this song is; the strings move along with the elegance of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", over a loungey ballad . The melody is a pure gold too as Tweedy rasps \\"Last cigarettes are all you can get turning your orbit around.\\"  <br /> <br /> \\"Jesus Etc\\" also reveals the first bit of the albums much discussed  9-11 symbolism. Completed a full 3 months before 9-11, the chorus \\"Tall buildings shake and voices escape singing sad sad songs.\\" Is eerily prophetic, add in a finger snapping cool chorus, and you have one of Wilco's most bittersweet offerings to date. <br /> <br /> <br />6. \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" (10/10) <br /> <br /> The Harrowing \\"Ashes of American Flags\\", structured around a broken record, two chord figure, is the most eerie song to hear after 9-11. You can hear the scraps of paper tossed around by a breeze in the aftermath in Ground Zero. The song ends with a piano, trying to force itself up through a wave of radio static. <br /> <br /> <br />7. \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" (10/10) <br /> <br />      After a two really heavy emotional tracks, \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" gives us a much needed breather. A pop song write out of the Lennon/ McCartney song book, a head bopping beat, and a feel good lyric, \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" is the best pure pop song on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. <br /> <br /> <br />8. \\"I'm The Man Who Loves You\\" (10/10) <br /> <br />       The country fried cousin of \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\", \\"I'm The Man Who Loves You\\" is propelled by a ratty blues riff, and a twangy acoustic guitar line. The most notable part of this song is the climactic horn fanfare at the beginning of the third verse; it's moments like this that make rock history. <br /> <br /> <br />9.  \\"Pot Kettle Black\\" (9/10) <br /> <br />       The main riff of this song reminds me of a Mid-western take on \\"Inbetween Days\\" by The Cure. An enjoyable pop number, much in the vein of \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" and \\"I'm The Man Who Loves You\\". <br /> <br /> <br />10. \\"Poor Places\\" (10/10)  <br /> <br />   This song bridges the gap between the three poppy tracks that proceeded it, and brings the album full circle with it's death squeal of feedback, and robotic monotone voice intoning \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\"   <br />   <br /> <br /> <br />11. \\"Reservations\\" (10/10) <br /> <br />\\"Reservations\\", the closer to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,  sounds like a more sentimental take on the first track; A cello weeps through out the song as cymbals twinkle, synthesizers bubble, and white noise swirls around you. The elements all swell up to a feverish crescendo during the chorus, reminding you of the first time you fell in love. After the main body of the song finishes, the noise wanes, and 5 minutes of brilliant ambient silence follows, allowing you to bask in it's sublimity.  <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a reason this album is so critically lauded; it's the single most representative portrait of 21st century America that has been painted thus far; a people, hopeful in the face of a mechanical world. If you heard it and didn't like it, sit down, try it again, and prepare to be moved. <br />
B0000024SI|5.0|Simply the single best album ever made, by anyone. That's my opinion.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth is a great band, and I knew I was getting a great CD when buying this.  All the tracks are great.  \\"Harvest\\" is the mostly acoustic quiet song for this CD (Opeth usually has one).  \\"Harvest\\", \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\", and \\"Dirge for November\\" have some of the best acoustic guitar work I've ever heard.  The aforementioned \\"Dirge\\" is probably my favorite song on the CD just because of the 2 minutes of acoustics at the end of the song.  Not to say it's the best, though, all the songs could really be called favorites, depending on what your taste is.  \\"Drapery Falls\\" is wonderfully balanced and drawn out in such a way that you won't even notice.  Every 2 minutes or so of this album has it's own unique mood to it, even within each song the atmosphere changes significantly.  This is Opeth's greatest strength.  \\"The Funeral Portrait\\" is the only song on here that I would say can't match the rest, because it seems less thought out and its more typical headbanger style doesn't fit them well.  This brings me to my only complaint about this album or Opeth in general- The heavy sections.  I, for one, am not bothered by the death vocals, but the thing is... even when Opeth bursts into a heavy riff and extreme double bass drumming, etc., the music flows so well that it still doesn't create as much manic intensity as a band like Emperor.  This makes the death growl kind of monotonous, because in the louder portions the music is still just as melodic, while Mikael's voice loses its melody.  This is evident in the title track and most of \\"Leper Affinity\\".  This isn't much of a complaint though, since I have a long attention span, the intruments during these sections are awesome, and many reviewers here love the heavyiness of the music.
B000002JR8|5.0|Pantera rule and this is definitley their best album. Phil is just an awesome vocalist and Dimebag and Rex just rip it up riff after riff. Viniie is a really good drummer. Pantera are truly one of the kings of metal. This is definitley their masterpeice Pantera are truly masters. Vulgar is also a really good album. Down and Superjoint Ritual are ok and so is Damageplan. Best songs are: Strength Beyond Strength, 5 Minutes Alone, I'm Broken, 25 Years and Shedding Skin. Planet Caravan is the only song on this cd i dont really like, i mean its ok but kinda boring and too mellow, dont get me wrong i like soft songs but like in the vein of otep's soft songs. Other GREAT bands you should check out if you like Pantera  are Otep, Lamb of God, Norma Jean, Shadows Fall, TBDM and Morbid Angel. Pantera rule!
B0001FGBL6|5.0|I'm a very fan of After Forever, Tristania, Theatre Of Tragedy and Therion among other \\"similar\\" bands. I don't want to say they look or play like each other; actually they all have their own sound, their own style of playing, writing lyrics and so on. When I say similar, I mean they all make amazingly beautiful music! <br /> <br />I took notice of Epica when knew that Mark Jansen left After Forever. So I listened to some samples from their official site ([...]) - after that I was sure I had to buy their album. The lyrics are meaningful and deep; the instruments are very well played; the choirs create a haunting atmosphere and the vocals from Simone Simons and Mark Jansen make an excellent contrast. They deserve more than five stars. <br /> <br />So, I recommend \\"The Phantom Agony\\" for everyone that appreciates one or more of the aforementioned bands. You'll not be disappointed.
B000023VR6|4.0|What more can be said about the D.R.E.? Master producer, groundbreaking artist, and hip-hop's most trusted talent scout (Snoop Dogg, Eminem), Dre's seen and done it all. So it's no wonder why, in terms of rapping, he's decided to keep a bit in the background on his second album, 2001. Like The Chronic, the good doctor delivers more cameos than a Tupac album (and trust me, that's saying something). Even Eddie Griffin weighs in on his views of the world, especially on the hilarious skit \\"Ed-ucation\\". Yet it's quite clear that Dre's running the show. From the beginning of the intro (TO BE CONTINUED
B00063MBU8|5.0|this cd is their best one yet. they still have the poppy-punk sound with pierres amazing voice, but this time they put in some heavier guitar sounds. i think this time they really explore their musical opitions. in one song they added strings, that sound awesome. if you liked their first cd, then you'll love their second. i recomend this cd to anyone who is into the pop-punk sound, with some really cute guys!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This cd rocks my face off.  It has the old style SP whith a whole lot of new.  Both are awesome.  And the best part, I can realate so easy to almost every song.  Thats my favorite part about SP and either of their cd's.  If you don't have you should go get one right now, and if you do, go get another one.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan stepped it up a knotch. they once again hit the nerve of teen angst and helped teenagers feel as though theyre not alone. <br /> <br />deeper lyrics than NO Pads.... and definetly better instrumentals <br /> <br />this cd catches you and you just want more. at times you want to cry and times you want to \\"Jump\\" and its all in 38 minutes <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|I am soo very happy this movie Backfired BIG TIME on o'l-Mikey Moore. Just goes to show you what influence a translucent movie like this has on influencing an election. IT HAS NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER!  <br /> <br />What Mikey and his idiotic Liberal buddies don't get is that they think that the average American does not know the difference between basic right and wrong. They think they are better and smarter than the rest of us and they have the answer. So you get is a laughable public display like this \\"Documentary\\" telling people what is right and what is wrong for them. Unfortunately there are many out there who can't think for themselves or filter out the BULL that believe this jackass and others like him.  <br /> <br />But what they fail to understand is that people see and understand what is going on, They can see through all the Bull **** and they are very capable of filtering it and making a decision.  THAT IS WHY BUSH WON AND GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS- The American People are not \\"Dumb\\" they just have much more common sense. <br /> <br />Unfortunately I'm sad to say I actually spent money to see this film, because I wanted to give him a chance to get his point across, and I really took a lot of what he says in this movie into consideration, Afterwards I went and researched the facts he puts fourth in this movie I soon found out that it was ALL FABRICATION SLICKLY EDITED to distort his viewer's minds to his point of view. It Didn't work O'l Mikey boy and guess what, NO ONE WILL EVER TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. <br /> <br />OH BTW- Michael Moore suggests in this movie and has also has said publicly that  \\"There is no Terrorist Threat\\" Well, just so you all know I Watched 3,000 of my fellow Americans die right in front of my very eyes in one day on September 11th 2001. I think that's enough to convince me that there ABSOLUTELY IS a Terrorist Threat. AND WHAT BUSH DID WAS RIGHT THING. <br /> <br />THANK GOODNESS Kerry gets to go back to the Senate andponder his thoughts - NICE JOB MIKEY!!!!! <br />
B00008OWZC|5.0|Let me say that this is the ultimate, the most extraordinary and simply put, the BEST live album in popular music the world has seen. 3 discs packed with music that will make you cry, and wish you had been there to see it. Because I doubt whether history will bring us in the future another band like Led Zeppelin. \\"How The West Was Won\\" is something every rock fan from around the world should listen to. Believe me, you won't regret it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is by far the BEST Britney album to date. The title fits so perfectly too, because once you pop it in, you will be IN THE ZONE! FOR SERIOUS! She is NOT a little girl anymore, she is ALL grown up, and TAKING OVER HER LIFE! Let the girl live, and buy in the zone!
B00063MBU8|5.0|i have to say \\"still not getting any\\" is a wicked album. a bit different and deeper than their last. this one expresses so much emotion..they are the coolest band, and most grateful! theyve come so far since they started and they deserve it all...anyone who says Simple Plan sucks is just envyous of their success...SP rock on!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Ok so I went and got Simple Plan's new CD \\"Still not getting any\\" the day it came out. It is by far the best CD ever. You can relate to every song they have. They have grown from their last CD \\"No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls\\". I deff. recomend going to the store and picking up a copy or 2 or 3 for yourself and your friends. The DVD that came with the CD as the duel disc is too funny. It shows them making the CD wich is actually quite interesting. Support SP and pick up their new CD \\"still not getting any\\" now!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan rocks! They will always be the best! This cd is so cool! It has a cd on one side and a dvd on the other! Its the best cd ever!!
B000002UAX|5.0|Any word ever used in any language created by human civilization cannot even begin to describe (much less rate!) how good the music on this album is. Wait a minute, did I just use a word? Oops...so much for the dramatic intro to my rating...in a word: UNBELIEVABLE!!! The Beatles work alone as solo artists on this one, yet combine it all together to create a sound greater than the sum of any music they ever wrote together.
B00063MBU8|4.0|Sound: Oh how they have changed, Simple Plan now definately differs from their old pop punk influnce as seen on No Pads No Helmets Just Balls. These guys have gone through a big change and it shows completely on Their new album titled 'Still Not Getting Any...' Songs Like \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Me Against The World\\" will totally change your mind about this bands 'sappy' sound and 'weak' musicianship. The instrumental/slower tempoed tracks on this album like 'Everytime' will have you on the edge of your seat.  <br /> <br />Lyrics: Like I've stated before, these guys have changed tons. The lyrics on this album are just jaw dropping, a completely different Simple Plan. Pierre Bouvier's voice is just amazing on this record, the backing vocals are also SO nice to hear. Songs like \\"Untitled\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" stir the emotions and songs like \\"Jump\\" and \\"Shut Up\\" will have your adrenaline up so quickly you wouldnt know what hit you. Bob Rock did a great job producing this album, the way that the lyrics and music are put to gether is just a perfect blend of reliable tunes.  <br /> <br />Overall Impression: This CD can seriously change your perception on what you've thought of these guys. The $9.98 you spend on this album is worth it (especially since there is DVD footage of the making of the album!) and the overall album is just impressive. This definately surpasses their old album and gives you a new outlook on Their band. If this CD was stolen or lost, I would totally spend cash to buy 10 new ones, it's great, go get it.
B00003CXV4|4.0|I enjoyed the sharp contrast between the characters of Nelson (played by Keanu Reeves) and Sarah (played by Charlize Theron). I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves and watched this movie after seeing him in \\"Something's Gotta Give\\". I just had to see him in a romantic role.<br /><br />Some of my favorite scenes in the movie occur when Sarah and Nelson first meet. She spends the first half of the movie pursuing him and he spends the last half pursing her. At first, Reeves' character seems very unlikeable -- almost wooden. As the movie progresses, Sarah's magic seems to wake up the workaholic from a deep sleep.<br /><br />There is a scene where Sarah and Nelson stand in the rain. It reminded me of the fight scenes from the Matrix Revolutions.<br /><br />In the DVD version when he is interviewed, Keanu states something to the affect that he is Nelson, and that he has met plenty of Sarah's in his life but they never called him back. Something else to watch -- Keanu loves motorcyles, and Nelson's office at the ad agency is decorated with photos of motorcycles. I wonder if he had any say in the decor...<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie but it is not my favorite. There could have been more chemistry between the characters. I was a little shocked to see one of the characters in a dress but it works. I won't spoil the plot but this movie will make you cry...and also wonder why we can't enjoy life as much as Sarah.
B00063MBU8|5.0|The cd is great.I got it the first day it came out.I've listened to it everyday.I suggest that everyone get it.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD rocks so much.... all the songs are so well written.  The DVD is awesome... it shows alll of the process of going through the makings of a CD.  If you love Simple Plan or are just hearing of them.... you have my word.... you will LOVE it!!!!
B000000H57|4.0|Its quite well-known that Type O Negative are not meant to be taken 100% seriously. There's a certain amount of tongue-in-cheekness about their music, be it funny song titles such as My Girlfriend's Girlfriend, or odd cheesy lyrics such as \\"I'll do anything... to make you come\\" (sung with Barry White-esque deepness to it). Nonetheless however, they are still a band who's music can be enjoyed on the surface.<br /><br />Vocalist Pete Steel has a great voice with a lot of range and passion behind it, be it the delicate higher notes or the laughable yet strangly wondorful deep crooning. His vocals certainly aren't the best technically, but then they don't need to be. He says what he wants to say and says it well. His bass guitar is deep, booming and usually distorted, driving the music forward seeing as the guitars and keyboards are usually much more melodic and atmospheric.<br /><br />The album itself is very goth-like. Slow in tempo and full of piano and clean guitar, it has sweeping, almost epic sound to it. Some of the tracks are more blatent in their piss-taking (Be My Druidess and My Girlfriend's Girlfriend in particular), while others are genuinely haunting, dark, emotional tracks (Love You To Death, Red Water). Some are even quite uplifting (Green Man). But through it all, there is a mixture of emotions - some tracks make Pete Steel sound fragile and depressed while others make him sound like an arrogant womaniser who cares about nothing, least of all what you think of him. Many bands can try to give massive variations in sound by being fast one minute and slow the next, heavy one minute and slow the next, melodic one minute and atonal the next etc, but none give variations in mood and feeling, which is what Type O Negative have, intentionally or otherwise, achieved here.<br /><br />October Rust is not the most mind-blowing album out there. Its not the fastest, heaviest, most accessible, most technical or anything else. But its not trying to be, and that in itself makes it worth listening to far more than those metal bands who attempt to carry such labels.n itself makes it worth listening to far more than those metal bands who attempt to carry such labels.
B000001FA4|5.0|For any fan of rock-era music, this is an absolute must-have. U2 equalled, but never bettered, this effort.<br /><br />Pardon me for putting this in deeply subjective terms, but this is all I have: this album changed the way I look at the world. Amnesty International owes a lot to this recording, starting with every penny and every hour I have ever donated. How many rock albums can make such a claim?<br /><br />Plus it's beautiful, well-crafted, and you can dance to it! Every song is great. You'll be glad you bought it.
B00063MBU8|5.0|<br />I was actually expecting the new album to not be so great. I am a livid Simple Plan fan and I couldn't have imagined an album being able to top their debut, \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls.\\"  <br />To my surprise, it was great! Its really hard to pick a favorites from the record, but I have to say I really like\\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Jump.\\" I can't explain how big of an impact that Simple Plan's music has on my life, but I can say that I'm only a bigger fan since hearing \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" Therefore, I can't give this record any less than 5 stars!   <br />
1594200106|4.0|I agree with the reviewer who said this book was long-winded and lurid...and I just loved the book. Reading it was like being dunked in a pot of fudge -- so rich that it is really just too much. The story opens in 1945, but is set in a Barcelona that is just recovering from the loss of moral bearings during the Spanish Civil War.  I loved this story about a boy who goes to the cemetery of forgotten books and becomes obsessed with finding out the history of the book he has chosen there, and why someone with the name of a character from the book is trying to burn all existing copies.  I loved the sad love story, I loved the desperate friendship that the characters showed for one another.  I especially loved the character, Fermin, the rehabilitated old communist, street bum, torture victim; everything he had to say was a joy to read.  The one thing I didn't care for, or understand, was the murderous obsession of one of the characters.  We are asked to believe that so much is set in motion because of one man's unexplained evil. Unfortunately,that is what is really asked of us.  I don't want to give away any of the book's end (and it certainly demanded a suspension of disbelief -- and a belief that fate and coincidence have a place in good books), but if you enjoy spooky, lurid, full-blown tales about lost books and doomed love, etc, then you will enjoy this.  It somehow misses being a \\"great book,\\" but is certainly a very, very enjoyable one.
B000007T2Z|4.0|Gospeed You Black Emperor are, in my mind, one of the best rock bands around today. To call them a rock band would be somewhat misleading however, because just as prog bands did in the 70s, Godspeed throw out typical conventions of rock and create something infintly more epic, timeless and adventurous than the typical cliches of rock could possibly imagine. Long songs made up of ambient soundscapes and intense, emotional instrumental music performed by three guitarists, two bassists and a drummer accompanied by violinists and cello players is what Godspeed is all about. Not cheesy keyboard effects, but a real string section - something missing in a lot of bands who attempt to make epic sweeping music.<br /><br />\\"F#A#(infinity symbol)\\" is the band's debut album. Well, before I go further, this isn't on the same level of brilliance as \\"Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven\\" or \\"Slow Riot For Zero Kanada\\", so if you're yet to hear this amazing band, then start with those two albums first. Now that that's out the way, \\"F#A#(infinity symbol)\\" is still a great album.<br /><br />As some of you may know, Godspeed You Black Emperor were used in the film 28 Days Later. The scene where Jim walks through an empty desolate London is one of the most chilling in the film, and it is East Hastings from this album that was used. I think the music was perfect, because the feeling of isolation and desolation that the film was trying to portray is exactly what this album feels like.<br /><br />The only negative point about this album is that the structures are very random. Godspeed have always been about long meandering songs that you can get lost in, but here there are wierd sound effects and separate pieces of music thrown together to make a song. They perfected this on later albums, getting the right balance, but here you end up wishing there was some more continuity. I've noticed this to be a common complaint, so if that bothers you and you've only heard this album then try their other stuff before you write them off.<br /><br />Godspeed are wondorful band and I urge you to try them, but while \\"F#A#(infinity symbol)\\" is a good album, it isn't their best. But once you've got \\"Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven\\" and \\"Slow Riot For Zero Kanada\\", definately come back to it.then try their other stuff before you write them off. <br /> <br />Godspeed are wondorful band and I urge you to try them, but while \\"F#A#(infinity symbol)\\" is a good album, it isn't their best.

B0000TG9E2|4.0|Disney's 1951 film \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one that held a strange appeal for me throughout my childhood. The Queen of Hearts literally gave me nightmares - I had dreams that I was Alice, trying to escape without losing my head - and the story of the Walrus and the Carpenter depressed me, yet I kept going back and watching it again and again. The movie fascinated me. Children love any opportunity to dream and make believe, and \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" has so many creative and fantastical elements that it provides an unlimited source of stimulation. Now, as an adult having recently read for the first time the books upon which the film was based, I was inspired to purchase the Masterpiece Edition of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" on DVD and revisit this Disney classic.<br /><br />The movie is actually based on two books by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was published in 1865, and \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There\\" appeared in 1871. Nowadays the two are commonly printed together in a single volume. Unfortunately, for fans of the books, the movie adaptation does not quite live up. The biggest problem with the movie is that it just doesn't make much sense. We don't understand why the things that happen to Alice happen, like why the Mad Hatter insists on changing seats all the time at the tea party, or why the bird that Alice disrupts calls her a serpent. These things are all explained in the books, but the meaning is lost in the translation to film. Still, a child is less likely to question the logic behind events in the movie, and will be more interested in the magical feeling of the story.<br /><br />The other big failing of the film is that all of the witty wordplay and riddles with which Carroll's books abound are nowhere to be found. Again, this will probably be less of an issue for a child viewer, but someone who has read the books can't help but notice the gaping hole left by this omission. Carroll's books where all ABOUT wordplay and witticism. Granted, it can be difficult to transfer such literary tricks to the screen, and most children probably would not pick up on the more complicated or obscure ones anyway, but certainly some of the simpler puns could have been carried across. Alice herself is also a less impressive heroine in the movie, as the loss of wordplay detracts from our sense of her as being exceptionally bright for a seven-year-old.<br /><br />My other observations about the adaptation from book to movie are fairly neutral. Disney made significant changes to the story, but this is to be expected considering the length and complexity of Carroll's books. Some episodes from the books are left out entirely, like the scenes with the Duchess, her peppery cook, and the pig baby, and also the exchanges Alice has with the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon. The order of events that were included in the movie is also switched about, particularly because of the fact that the movie combines the plots of both books. Interestingly, the Queen of Hearts in the movie is actually an amalgamation of two different characters - the Queen of Hearts from \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and the Red Queen from \\"Through the Looking-Glass.\\"<br /><br />However, criticisms of the book-to-movie adaptation aside, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is still a good, solid children's animated film. It won't hold the same appeal for older audiences, but I remember how much I enjoyed watching it as a child and am sure it will continue to inspire the imaginations of today's young viewers. The movie is also a visually impressive artistic accomplishment. The animation is superb. In fact, I'd say it's one of the most vivid and lush of all of Disney's earlier films. The brightly-colored characters really stand out against the predominantly black background.<br /><br />The 2-disc Masterpiece Edition DVD has a wealth of special features. Most are geared toward the child viewer, which is to be expected, but there are some pieces that even an adult will find interesting. Disc 1 offers a \\"Virtual Wonderland Party\\" for the kids, which is rather like an interactive television show; sing-along songs of \\"The Unbirthday Song\\" and \\"All In A Golden Afternoon\\" (the song that the talking flowers perform); an \\"Adventures in Wonderland\\" game which is fairly simple, being intended for children, but which I found particularly delightful because it is actually based on riddles (I thought this was a nice way to give the movie a tie-in with the wordplay of Carroll's original story); a featurette including the song \\"I'm Odd,\\" sung by the Cheshire Cat, which was one of at least 30 songs written for the film but never included; and the original Mickey Mouse short \\"Thru the Mirror.\\"<br /><br />Disc 2 rounds out the collection of special features with \\"One Hour in Wonderland,\\" Walt Disney's first TV show, hosted by Kathryn Beaumont (the voice of Alice); \\"An Alice Comedy: 'Alice's Wonderland'\\" which was the 1923 pilot film for a TV comedy series; an \\"Operation Wonderland\\" behind-the-scenes featurette from 1951; a half-hour excerpt from the Fred Waring show, which aired in 1951; numerous deleted materials, including an interesting featurette about a song originally written for \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" but which was left out and adapted for use in \\"Peter Pan\\" in 1953; an art gallery; theatrical trailers from 1951 and from the 1974 re-release; and TV introductions from 1951 and 1964.r, which is to be expected, but there are some pieces that even an adult will find interesting.

B0001XAPX8|5.0|Just when you think the critics are starting to get it right, they get it wrong again.  That's what happened to this film.  People stayed away in droves from this well done and thoughtful film by a director with a subtle touch that escapes most of our video age movie going public.  Anthony Hopkins, Gary Sinise, and Nicole Kidman give real performances that will challenge and hopefully enrage some of you into seeing the dangers of social convention and why we let bad things happen.  This is a movie for people who ask questions, not just for those who feel they have all the answers.
B000000ZKD|3.0|It's a little like HAIR comes to Woodstock. I was surprised I liked it. Definitely Beatle influenced. But it WAS a good album!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I'm a huge Simple Plan fan, and I loved their first CD ('No Pads, No Helments.. Just Balls'). I didn't think their music could get any better, but this record proved otherwise. All the songs are amazing, and the DVD is hilarious. This is DEFINENTLY a must have, so go buy it if you don't already have it!
B00005JMJG|3.0|This film is not as great as everyone thinks it is. It revolves around a relatively simple idea: erase the memory of a specific relationship. The premise sounds appealing but I believe Jim Carrey was miscast as was Kate Winslet. I didn't find them believable nor did I understand why it was they were so attracted to each other. Granted, I understand that Carrey's character is dying on the inside and wants to explore the crazy side of his nature which he keeps repressed. And Winslet represents that urge to act with total abandon and impulse. But the case is never made for why Winslet is attracted to Carrey's character. I never saw it. It never developed for me. And I found myself getting bored at various times during the story. This isn't a film I would want to see again and while I think Kaufman came up with the potential for a clever story, it fails to materialize and wasn't that entertaining to me. I don't understand why so many people came to enjoy this film so much. I'm glad I'm not one of them.
B00063MBU8|5.0|After their debut album \\"No pads,No helmets...Just Balls\\" went double platinum, these canadians didn't stop there , and didn't let it go to their head, they are still just as loyal to their fans. \\"Still not getting any\\" offers a variety of fast and slow songs with great lyrics, and meaning. \\"Welcome To my life\\" is a song many people can relate to, its about being lonely. But no matter what Simple Plan will always be loyal to their fans, they have stayed after almost every single show, not even getting a glass bottle thrown at their heads will stop these guys from getting to know their fans. And \\"Still not getting any\\" is just another present from theses amazing guys, and a very great one at that.
B00005JN7O|2.0|When I first watch its preview in San Diego ComicCon that they have interview with Jude Law and all, I thought its gonna be something really special that capture something from the 70s, and I'm wrong! its freaking boring..   The idea is very unique indeed, but it get raped by the very very poor production. The problem is through the whole movie all you see is the actors running and walking around some still CG background, the camera never actually move a bit so you see more detail of where they are, I take one scene for example, the cave they walk into at teh end, one second they spot it at teh outside 20 yard from the entrance, hold still for a while , the next second the shot taken they already inside walking deep in, there arent even a single frame describe how they get there from where they landed, such kindda details skipping problems are all over the movie. What happen is in this movie everything else other than the actors are done in CGI, none of parts in the movie are taken shot outside. While everything is computerized they dun spend enough effort to design everything, many of those background are only 1 beautiful still picture and they have never been rendered into motion, which makes the way the movie goes in such an odd way(except for the first 20 mins maybe), 1/2 of the times the audience only gotta see actors are walking or sitting inside somewhere without letting us see whats around them. By loosing so much details the movie dun even feel like completed. Such a bad end for a project that started so innovatively, a pity.
B000066I6N|5.0|I'll have to admit up front that I've been a big Zepplin fan since I was a teenager. So now that I have grey hair and teenagers of my own I have had many years to let their music get into my soul. Now I have to admit that pretty much all of Plant's solo work has left me cold. I think it's just an utter lack of memorable music. Now I have to tell you how happy I was when I heard this CD. In my mind, this is easily the very best thing Robert Plant has done since In Through the Out Door. His voice, though clearly not as strong,is still plenty strong here, and more than that, it has that something extra that's been missing all these years, that edge, that feel that made him one of the greats. This CD is fantastic; the songs are great, and the band and the arrangements are again, better than anything Plant has done since Zep; superior! In many subtle ways the arrangements here sound like the best of Zep. This album could have come between LZIII and Houses of the Holy.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead had been one of, if not, the strongest and most consistently-high-quality bands for the last ten years, since \\"The Bends\\" was released. I'm not going to hide it, they have become in this time my favorite band. \\"OK Computer\\" quickly became my favorite album in my collection and I was pumped about the release of \\"Kid A\\". So I bought it, popped it in, and... <br /> <br />Was disappointed. Where were the happy, melodic rock melodies I had  come to love. Where was the GUITAR? For months I tried to jam in in the CD player and hope it magically changed into \\"OK Computer Part II\\", but alas it didn't. But one day I stuck it in and everything clicked... <br /> <br />\\"Kid A\\" is such a great rock statement, brilliant written by Thom Yorke. Coming off the greatest success of their careers, Radiohead decided to completely change their formula of writing music from rock to electronic, while keeping the catchy melodies.  After months of listening, this album finally hit me as Radiohead when I started listening to the songs for what they really were. <br /> <br />\\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" is a stunning opener, with its minimalist organ line and voice effects galore. \\"Kid A\\" has a cute little piano lines, with an aggressive electric snare keeping a flowing beat. \\"The National Anthem\\" shows the first sign of guitar with a nice Radiohead riff and a great sax solo.   \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" was a song I always liked, a true Radiohead ballad. \\"Treefingers\\" is a lush instrumental. <br /> <br />The second half kicks off with \\"Optimistic\\", the song that really screams old Radiohead on this CD, I'm sure everyone's heard it on the radio or on MTV or something. \\"In Limbo\\" is probably the weakest song on this CD, but it's one of the few to have distinct guitar riffs. \\"Idioteque\\" is a very agressive, emotional electronic song with a hard electro-snare beat; possibly the album's best song. \\"Morning Bell\\" is a beautiful, uplifting-morning like tune. And Radiohead yet again closes beautifully with \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\", with organ and harps galore. <br /> <br />Thom's lyrics never falter (which shouldn't surprise anyone) and it's nearly impossible to say whether this or \\"OK Computer\\" is the true Radiohead masterepiece. But that really doesn't matter I'll take any Radiohead album...OK maybe not \\"Pablo Honey\\"...
B000002AH1|4.0|I am not a fan of Miles Davis' 1970's fusion period; but even I have to admit LIVE-EVIL is an excellent jazz record.  Normally listed as a \\"live\\" album, LIVE-EVIL actually splits its time between The Cellar Door in Washington D.C. and Columbia Studio B in New York City.  Sonically, I can detect little difference between the two locations with the exception of The Cellar Door patron's applause and a slightly louder \\"hum\\" of the electronic instruments (more on than later).<br /><br />With the exception of Miles himself and drummer Jack Dejohnette, the band line up is fairly fluid.  Michael Henderson, Dave Holland and Ron Carter alternate on bass duties.  Gary Bartz, Steve Grossman, and Wayne Shorter trade off on sax duties.  John McLaughlin plays guitar five of the eight selections.  Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul, and Herbie Hancock supply keyboard work in various combinations.  And Airto Moreira, Hermeto Pascoal, and Billy Cobham throw in additional percussion throughout.  (Gary Bartz comments in the liner notes that Davis never \\"fired\\" a member of the band. Instead musicians simply knew when it was time for them to move on.)  This ever changing rotation of personnel may account for why cut to cut this album does not settle on a particular \\"sound\\".<br /><br />\\"Sivad\\" opens with a blast of almost atonal rock pandemonium and then comes to rest on a blues groove to ride to the conclusion fifteen minutes later.  \\"Little Church\\" is a short \\"wistful\\" mediation before the bluesy two instrument grumpy exchange in \\"Gemini Double Image\\".  \\"What I Say\\" boasts the leanest lineup of the album but displays an almost traditional \\"conversation\\" among the musicians with snappy drums, amused rambling keyboards, McLaughlin's chatty guitar, Miles delivering his signature trumpet dialogue, all ending on a drum solo. V \\"Nem Um Talvez\\" is a more somber piece resembles the pensive, quiet prayers of a monk in his cell.<br /><br />The second disc opens with a plaintive trumpet meditation in \\"Selim\\" as a \\"quiet before the storm\\".  This is followed by the over twenty three minutes wild Mardi Gra ride of \\"Funky Tonk\\"-the show piece of LIVE-EVIL in many ways.  We end the album with \\"Inamorata And Narration by Conrad Roberts\\" (itself clocking in at almost twenty-seven minutes)-something of a let down after \\"Funky Tonk\\" but it does have its moments.<br /><br />LIVE-EVIL is a wonderful and adventurous album that still stands up over thirty years later.  Complaints are what you would expect.  With all the able and outstanding young musicians on hand, Miles himself goes missing for several minutes at a time.  John McLaughlin's guitar style remains a detriment for many even now-although it does not sound nearly as abrasive and edgy now as it did in 1970-I myself hated it then but often times find it very enjoyable now.  The truly objectionable elements rest with the technological limitations of the early 1970's.  A discernable tape \\"hiss' can be heard in the quieter moments and the \\"hum\\" and \\"buzzes\\" the electronic instruments made just by virtue of being \\"on\\" is annoying.  (I honestly had forgotten how much noise those early electronics made.)<br /><br />\\"Fusion\\"-era Miles Davis is still not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  Long, meandering pieces of music will try your patience and won't work if you are not in the mood.  But at least LIVE-EVIL gives us some indication of what Miles was aiming at.

B0002OERI0|5.0|This CD takes it beyond anything Green Day has done to date and pushes it to the next level. We see the Green Day guys following in suit with Blink 182 (although they'd never admit it) and pushing their boundaries beyond the pop-punk limits I honestly never though they'd exceed. This album is a well put-together piece of work, the whole album has a real sense of flow to it, all the songs have some hook that will keep you interested. But it's not just the hooks. American Idiot goes in depth with their message and their music, something that not every band can get away with, this album really pulls it off. This is definitely the best album I've boughten in a while, I'd suggest you do the same, you honestly won't be disappointed if you're looking to hear some good punk-rock.
B00004TDRD|5.0|Steven Spielberg's second feature film (and one of his most challenging projects), Jaws was THE blockbuster event of 1975. Based on Peter Benchley's novel, this very effective thriller set box office records higher than any previous film....and made beachgoers ask themselves if that dip in the ocean was really necessary.<br />Screenwriters Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb (who also have roles in the movie) wisely jettison the melodramatic aspects of the source novel and focus on the core of the story. <br />It's summer in Amity, a sleepy Long Island town that depends on &quot;summer dollars&quot; from thousands of tourists who come to stay in seaside cottages (the summer dinks, they are called). When a young girl goes skinny dipping in the nearby sea and is fatally attacked by a shark, Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is coerced by the mayor and town council to keep the incident under wraps. He reluctantly does so, though he will regret it, for a few days later, the shark claims another victim, a young boy named Alex Kintner.<br />Finally convinced that there is a shark out there, Amity's politicians and citizens take action...but not wisely. When shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) bids for a contract to catch and kill the shark, the town elders &quot;take it under advisement&quot; and the shark hunt becomes a wild free-for-all seagoing circus.<br />When shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), called in by Chief Brody to help in the investigation and shark hunt, arrives and sees the shark (which he identifies as a tiger shark) caught by local fishermen, he examines the remains of the first victim. What he deduces is chilling: the deadly creature prowling out to sea is a great white shark.<br />Jaws is one of those rare movie adaptations that is better than its source novel. The screenplay is crisp and taut, yet with enough light moments and scenes of sometimes wry humor that ease the ever increasing tension, particular when Brody, Hooper and Quint set out to hunt the great white shark....becoming the hunted in the process. Spielberg, only 27 at the time, overcame the difficulties of shooting a movie on the water and dealing with a balky mechanical shark (nicknamed &quot;Bruce&quot;). Jaws also put composer John Williams on the map with movie audiences with his now-famous &quot;shark motif&quot; and would earn him his second Oscar for Best Score. <br />The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD is excellent. The movie is presented in letterbox format, and the sound and image are above average. The documentary on the making of the film is also first-rate. All in all, a must-get for Spielberg (and action film) fans. --.
B000005JA8|4.0|For the past two or so years my taste in music has run down the more \\"weird\\" lane... and \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" was one of the early starters of that change. <br /> <br />I love the calcuated chaos of everything in this cd. You feel like somehow the cd will derail completely, like a mad train on it's last gasp. One reviewer privously compared it to the writings of Faulkner... which is one of the best descriptions I've heard yet of the album. Unlike him, however, I find that to tbe one of the endearing qualities of the album instead of a hindrance. <br /> <br />Captain Beefheart's mix of blues and spazztic avant-grade is mind expanding and will either divert your musical tastes to a whole new level, or will make you whimper back to your pop standards.
B00063MBU8|4.0|The sophomore album from Simple Plan totally tops their debut \\"No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls\\". Sorry to use a cliche, but their sound has matured a lot. But not to worry, the guys have managed to keep their old \\"punk-pop\\" sound.     Awesome guitar riffs, catchy melodies, and lyrics that will still make every teenager who is listening say \\"I can relate to that\\" can be expected. This album is great, and I can't wait to hear what they have for us next.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I LOVE this cd. i especially like the song \\"crazy\\". If you ever had a doubt about buying it stop now. it is a lot better than the first one. It sounds less poppy and doesn't sound like it's so processed.yeah dude this rocks!!!!

B0000024W3|5.0|Although Bob has certainly released albums that in popular and critical perception were worse than Self-Portrait (Knocked Out Loaded, Down In The Groove, even 1973's Dylan album) none have receive the amount of derision and scorn.  Why exactly?  Of all of Bob's musical U-turns that could've turned into career suicides (going from covers to originals, going from protest to personal, going from acoustic to electric, going from rock star to recluse hermit and then returning as a country gentleman) this was the only one that didn't bring him for fans that he alienated in the process.  It was the first move he made that didn't seem wise in retrospect.  Plus the title, Self-Portrait, certainly promised a far more in-depth and personal view of the artist than it delivered.  But I think the thing that still bugs Dylan fans about Self-Portrait is the big question that hovers over the entire album:  Why'd he do it?  Was recording an album almost entirely of covers a big F.U. to Albert Grossman who he was suing for control of his songwriting royalties?  (Much like Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music).  Or even a big F.U. to all of those rabid fans who were dissecting even the trite clich&eacute;s of Nashville Skyline hoping for a deeper meaning?  Much like the motorcycle accident, a way/excuse to slow down the star-making treadmill he was trapped on.  Or had the \\"amnesia\\" set in and this was the best that Bob could do?  He has claimed that Self-Portrait was in his own way his \\"bootleg\\" record.  What did he mean by that?  It's not like this was previously unreleased (legally) material that he put out, like The Bootleg Series or even The Basement Tapes, he deliberately recorded this to sound like a bootleg that didn't exist.  Considering that the big Bob bootleg at the time was The Great White Wonder, which mixed 1961 Dinkytown recordings with 1967 Woodstock demos, he might have meant that Self-Portrait was just as jumbled, schizophrenic and incompatible with itself.  For those looking for something Bob's lyrics, this double album was certainly a disappointment.  He didn't even write 2/3rd of the songs.  And those he did write were either really sloppy live versions from the Isle of Wight Festival of previously released songs, or songs with no words (\\"Woogie Boogie\\", Wigwam\\") or only two lines repeated ad infinitum (\\"All The Tired Horses\\").  Really the only new lyrics on here belonged to \\"Living The Blues\\" and \\"Minstrel Boy\\".  But I like it.  It's one of my all-time favorite Dylan albums.  Of course, that may just be my tendency to root for the underdog. Plus the fact that I was not around to be disappointed during its initial release.  But really it's not that bad.  If you look at it right.  Don't think of it as an accurate, in-depth look into Dylan's whole life.  Rather see it as a blurry snapshot from a day in the life.  Singing along to a couple of pop tunes on the radio that he kind of likes (\\"The Boxer\\", \\"Early Morning Rain\\").  Remembering some old tunes from his past growing up in the 50s (\\"Blue Moon\\", \\"Let It Be Me\\").  But mostly some older folk tunes that he discovered later and inspired him in the early days playing (\\"Copper Kettle\\", \\"Belle Isle\\", \\"Little Sadie\\", \\"Alberta #1\\" & \\"#2\\").  Even trying to figure out the chords to one of them (\\"In Search Of Little Sadie\\").  Goofing around outside the studio making music, ala _The Basement Tapes_ (\\"Woogie Boogie\\", \\"Minstrel Boy\\").  Trying to figure out some words (\\"Wigwam\\") or at least the next line (\\"All The Tired Horses\\") of some new songs he's just started writing.  Going to his day job singing songs he doesn't really feel connect to anymore (the live versions of \\"She Belongs To Me\\" and \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" with the forgotten lyrics).  It's almost Dylan's most recorded record (at least until _Empire Burlesque_).  Unlike all Dylan albums up to this point (and most after) which sound like they were recorded in under a week with a new group of under-rehearsed musicians learning the songs for the first time.  This album features what is Dylan's first vocal overdub, when he harmonizes with himself (almost) on \\"The Boxer\\".  And while there are some definite recording tricks and time taken on this album there is still a certain amount of the usual sloppiness on the album (like the unmistakable error that ruins the otherwise perfect \\"Days Of 49\\").  But it's like he's taken these little doodles on crumpled up napkins and put them into these ornate gilded frames.  Much the same way Phil Spector's production transformed the Beatles' Get Back project into the perplexing Let It Be.  Definitely not what anyone wanted or expected at the time.  In some respects, it was so weird, that every album that got decent critical or popular acclaim after it (New Morning, Blood On The Tracks, Infidels, Oh Mercy!, Time Out Of Mind) were considered comebacks.first time.

B000002A46|5.0|Anyone that says a women with such tremendous vocal talent cannot make an awesome christmas must have broken eardrums. I must say Miss Carey has a divine gift from god. These songs are classicaly arranged and is something you would listen to with anyone ranging from your children to your friends at a christmas party. Christmas productions from other artists like Christina Aguilera, Destinys Child are sooo over produced and oversang...simply these artists have tried to produce an album with same calibur as Miss Mariah Carey...but fail in doing so...just remember there is only ONE MARIAH CAREY...and this cd will prove to any doubting listener just how powerful her set of 7 octave pipes are...simply amazing...I cant say enough!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Omg. I'm absolutly in LOVE with the new album!! There is no choosing what song is my favorite because they are all good. Simple plan is like my favorite band and i love them more and more everyday. They were made for me!! I still can't say how much i love the new CD.
B000068TPN|1.0|I just watched this movie and I had to force myself to see all of it.  Lt. Col. Hal Moore's (Mel Gibson) speaches were syrupy sweet melodramatic drivel.  In fact, much of the dialogue is the same way. This film had none of the reality Platoon had, which is the most comprehensive Vietnam War movie.  We Were Soldiers is a very sanitized and fictionalized version of the Vietnam War. In addition to Platoon, I would recommend, Tigerland, Hamburger Hill, and Full Metal Jacket. <br /> <br />
B0000024SI|5.0|Highway 61 Revisited is not nearly as good as Bringing It All Back Home but still an amazing album.  More fun up-tempo blues numbers: \\"Tombstone Blues\\", the title track, \\"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry\\", and \\"From A Buick 6\\" (two more great titles!).  \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" deserves its reputation as an all-time rock'n'roll classic.  Bob is stretching with \\"Ballad Of A Thin Man\\" and it works.  Creepy and funny, it's my favorite song on the album.  Side two is a problem though.  Other than the title track, it's filled with somewhat tedious, mid-tempo, too long excuses for clever lyrics: \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\", \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" and \\"Desolation Row\\".  \\"Desolation Row\\" even features the return of that incessantly jamming slightly off-key guitar from \\"It's All Over Now\\".  Sure, nothing could be as good as it, but highway 61 Revisited is still a worthy follow-up to Bringing It All Back Home.
B00063MBU8|5.0|this is by far the best cd i have listened to in a very long time.  this album is so good and all the songs have a strong message.  i think simple plan did an awesome job of writing these songs and coming up with the different songs.  i love every single song on this cd.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Wow.  That was my first reaction when i read the lyrics to their first single, Welcome to my life.  Seriously, it was like they took a page from my journal and wrote a song about it.  I couldn't wait to get the album.  The day it came out, my mom picked me up from school early and took me to two different stores so i could get all 3 copies and i'll admit, it was worth it.  You can tell how much they've grown up over the past couple of years but they still know how to write music that their fans can really relate too.  From the up-beat \\"Jump\\" to the slow and sad \\"Untitled\\" this album was better than i ever could have expected.  I am so proud of the guys for putting out another awesome album and even more proud to call myself a Simple Plan fan.
B0000025OP|3.0|I've got to admit, I really don't like Planet Waves.  For one thing I'm not a big fan of The Band.  I've not particularly liked any of the stuff they've done as a group.  Robbie Robertson always seemed like a smug, condescending, pretentious rock-star (like Sting, Bono or Phil Collins).  Back when they were just a band and not The Band, they were good for what Dylan was doing on tour in 1966 (namely loud), but there's a reason why he always ended up using the Nashville session players on his album.  (The fact that drummer Levon helm was too chicken to endure the boos of Tour '66 is another stroke against them).  Their playing has always been as subtle as a sledgehammer.  But it's not entirely The Band's fault that I don't like this album.  On Planet Waves, Bob finally achieves what he was aiming for on Nashville Skyline and New Morning; he becomes a completely detached, uninvolved songwriter.  But where those two discs were charming in the sincere ineptitude, this one actually pulls it off slickly - much to its detriment.  And as a result songs like \\"Tough Mama\\", \\"Hazel\\", \\"Something There Is About You\\", \\"You Angel You\\", and \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" are almost impossible to tell apart.  It'll become a bad habit that'll pop up again and again in Bob's career.  The opening number holds some promise.  The Cajun Zydeco of \\"On A Night Like This\\" promises more of the weird genre experimentation of New Morning's \\"Winterlude\\" and \\"If Dogs Run Free\\", but never follows up on it.  \\"Going Going Gone\\" is in fact a really good song, but you can hardly tell over The Band's showboating.  (Although I like most of At Budokan, the version of \\"Going, Going Gone\\" on there proves it could be much much worse).  \\"Forever Young\\" ends Bob's tradition of adding more than one version of the same song to the same album (\\"Alberta\\" and \\"Billy\\").  While the slower second version is pretty darn good (and proof that Rod Stewart is a thief), the fast version makes the song seem almost as forgettable as the rest of the album.  Compare \\"Dirge\\" with the similarly arranged (just piano and acoustic guitar) \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" from The Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3, and see how distracting Robbie Robertson is in comparison to Mark Knopfler.  His little scratching the string thing is all over here and really annoying.  Even without The Band, \\"The Wedding Song\\" sounds about as tacked on as it really was.  Not that the album is painfully unlistenable or anything.  With a musician as talented as Bob Dylan, even when he's coasting there's bound to be a certain amount of quality to endeavor.  It's just that there's a real lack of anything interesting or risky going on here.rest of the album.

B00063MBU8|5.0|The fantastic follow up to their debut album. The extra DVD footage of the band is funny, as it follows them around singapore or japan...(not quite sure which)and though the photo shoot for the album cover itself (any confusion on which old dude is pierre, seb, jeff, david or chuck is cleared out!!)  <br />The tracks are all equally as good as each other, but the 2 that stand out as the best, to me, are; Welcome To My Life and Crazy. <br />So if you don't already own this album, I suggest you buy it!!! :D
B00063MBU8|5.0|Well, I just wanna say that you guys, kick asses! I really love the song \\"crazy\\"...the lyric is just what we all need to hear. Of curse I love all SP songs. But I think we all should listen carefully to \\"Crazy\\". It makes you think about what you are doing, how are ya livin. If we love punk & SP, we have to act like it!!
B0000025GW|4.0|This album bugged out a lot of people, particularly when it first came out, almost solely because of its unremitting message.  But really if you ignore the lyrics, there's a good record in here.  Not great but good.  And as the fear that Bob has totally lost his mind and will be doing nothing but singing Jesus songs for the rest of his life, this album's stature has grown.  Clearly, whether you agree or even care about what he's singing about, he really means it.  Personally I don't care if the lyrics are about sins, salvation and Satan or if they're about hoboes, immigrants and landlords.  I'm only interested in the music.  And musically, it's a lot more consistent than Street Legal.  Although there aren't any songs as good as the three good ones on that record, overall it's much better.  Clearly \\"New Pony\\" has re-inspired Bob to write more songs around a single riff.  \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\", \\"Slow Train\\", \\"Gonna Change My Way Of Thinking\\" and \\"When You Gonna Wake Up?\\" all follow this formula.  They're best songs on this album.  The slower numbers, \\"Precious Angel\\", \\"I Believe In You\\" and \\"When He Returns\\" are powerful, but not nearly as impressive.  Also included is a whole new category for Dylan, Kid's songs.  Since the first songs most of us ever learn are Bible songs, it does make since.  \\"Man Gave Names To All The Animals\\" is silly and fun (which is nice on such an otherwise heavy record).  And \\"Do Right To Me Baby (Do Unto Others)\\", with it's extra beat added every fourth measure (going from 4/4 to 5/4) is one of the most musically complicated things Bob's written since the jazz chords of \\"If Dogs Run Free\\" or the constantly shifting keys of \\"In Search Of Little Sadie\\".  Overall Slow Train Coming is a pretty good album, and despite being a fairly staunch atheist, I enjoy listening to it.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Ha! Yeah right! Simple Plan is back and there is no disappointment in tow!! For those of you who are scared to buy Simple Plan's sophmore album for fear of change, don't be! Yes, the songs are different, but it's all the same Simple Plan. You gotta love it! It's a wonderful album to relate to. If you are feeling down, just pop that baby in and Simple Plan will be there for therapy. it's just a wonderful, fun album to rock out to. The DVD is also great. It helps you to get to know the \\"essence\\" of Simple Plan. They are great guys! Enjoy!
B00063MBU8|4.0|Simple Plan's sophmore album, Still Not Getting Any is phenominal. This album shows a much deeper side of Simple Plan compared to their first album.  Their first album was fun and crazy and just...them. I was hoping for the second album to be somewhat like the first. When I listened to SNGA I was leary if I liked it or not. Then I realized that it is still the great Simple Plan we know and love. On the new album the songs are much deeper. This album is great in so many ways, and the dvd is awesome too! Two for the price of one, who can beat that? I would definately reccomend Still Not Getting Any to everyone because even though it is different from the first album, it is still 100% Simple Plan and 100% great music!
B0000C8AW7|5.0|Love & Theft is to Time Out Of Mind what Under The Red Sky is to Oh Mercy!: a fun, goofy follow-up to a dark, murky, serious Daniel Lanois produced comeback.  Although the perception of it has waned a little since, I don't know why Love & Theft was so hailed at first while Under The Red Sky was so reviled.  Perhaps the four years (instead of one) that separated Love & Theft from its predecessor gave rise to fears that Time Out Of Mind was going to be Bob's last big hurrah.  Maybe producing it himself with his touring band instead of using flavor-of-the-month Don Was and his stable of rock stars, helped lower expectations a bit.  Who knows?  I liked it when it first came out - and I still like it.  Lyrically it's his funniest since Another Side Of Bob Dylan.  Knock-knock jokes?  Booty call?  Hunting bare?  \\"Throw your panties over board\\"?  \\"I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time\\"?  \\"Call down to room service/ Said send up a room\\"?  I know Bob's words don't usually affect me that much, but this is great stuff.  And musically - it's all over the map (crooners, blues, `50s rockers), but thanks to the touring band backing him, it's still cohesive.  Most of the songs are more versions of the 3 (or less) chord blues (\\"Tweedle Dum & Tweedle Dee\\", \\"Summer Days\\", \\"Lonesome Day Blues\\", and \\"Honest With Me\\").  Yet, \\"Moonlight\\" and \\"Bye And Bye\\" use some the most complicated jazzy chords since \\"If Dogs Run Free\\" from New Morning.  And to keep the album from getting too monotonous, the occasional accordion, banjo or violin just shows up.  As hard as it may be to believe, Bob's latest really is one of his best.
B00063MBU8|5.0|<br /> <br />Simple Plan has grown so much over the last 4 years. They used to tour in an ambulance, and even if people didnt want to hear them,they just kept doing what they loved,and now thats what I call dedication...and look where it's got them.Personally I prefer Simple Plan over alot of other music because they sing about real life problems..not about girls and cars...their music helps you alot through tough times and helps you to realize that as a teenager alot of people do go through the same things as yourself. <br /> In their debut album \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\" they practically(since they were just starting out) had to do what their record label wanted them to do as well as the producer. Now the guys of Simple Plan feel that they have more space to do what they want, and their producer(Bob Rock) has allowed them that. From their debut album to \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" the guys have matured alot through their music. <br />You would  think that because someone is famous that that person doesn't go through tough times, but as Simple Plan has said..that no matter how famous you get your life isnt perfect and you do go through alot of things. If you just listen to songs like \\"Welcome To My Life\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" you'll realize that nothing is ever perfect. I never would think that guys(specifically Simple Plan) would think about the things that they do in the song \\"Crazy\\", a line from that song goes \\" Young girls dying to be on t.v , they won't stop till they've reached their dreams, diet pills, surgery...........is everybody going crazy?, is anybody gonna save me?\\". I love that song so much because it is true the world makes you think that girls have to be like models when really everyone is good just they way they are. <br />Don't judge the any of their albums by the  titles, because just like the old saying \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" then you would never know how good this band is. This album has been #2 in Canada, #3 in the United States, and #3 in Japan. Now that's amazing how Simple Plan, just a little group from Montreal Canada, could be #3 all the way in Japan! and I think that no other band deserves this as much as Simple Plan.  <br />This music is great, especially if your a teenager, but it  doesn't matter what age you are because my mom even likes Simple Plan and she is 38! <br />So if you haven't already, go and pick up the new album \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" and why not throw in \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\"
B0000026UL|5.0|Once again Bob switches tracks on us.  And much like I hated to agree with the popular consensus about Blood On The Tracks, I've got to admit I really like Oh Mercy!.  Of course the fact that this was the first Dylan album I ever bought (okay... permanently borrowed from my father) may have something to do with it.  Sure \\"Man In The Long Black Coat\\" threatens to bring up comparisons to his earlier work in much the same way \\"Dark Eyes\\" or \\"Brownsville Girl\\" did, but luckily the song is strong enough to stand on its own - and the atmospheric touches Daniel Lanois added, help it seem like less of a throwback.  Aside from that song, my other two favorite numbers on here are \\"Political World\\" and \\"Everything Is Broken\\".  Two up-tempo rockers based on simple blues riffs that help keep this album from being a complete refutation of the two albums that came before it.  Personally my least favorite tunes are the ones that everyone else liked: the slower material like \\"Where Teardrops Fall\\", \\"Ring Them Bells\\", \\"Disease Of Conceit\\", and \\"Shooting Star\\", but they're not bad.  Every Dylan album has its ups and downs, but it's really the quality of the songs in the middle (\\"What Was It You Wanted\\", \\"What Good Am I?\\", \\"Most Of The Time\\") that really make the album work as a whole.
B00008EY65|5.0|Hellboy...what a great title for a film, anyway this is one of the best (if not the best) comic book translations to film yet. Ron Perlman does a bang-up job as Hellboy who fell to Earth through a portal that was opened by the Nazi's in 1941. What separates Perlman's Hellboy from the rest is his ascerbic wit and undeniably likeable human qualities (i.e. compassion and love). But, don't get me wrong this is no lovefest. Hellboy is a killer plain and simple. He was raised by a loving scientist to rid the world of evil, so when things go wrong he's the one they call in. The movie has plenty of action and outstanding special effects that rival the X-Men series. Guillermo Del Toro does a masterful job of directing and uses the FX effectively. Overall, Hellboy is definitly worth a watch and for hardcore sci-fi or comic buffs it's a must own. Highly Recommended.
B000002552|3.0|Much like Blonde On Blonde, I don't get the appeal of this double-album either.  First of all I don't understand why they have to sell this on two CDs.  At 76:41 it could easily fit onto one.  ­Blonde On Blonde and Self-Portrait are both sold as single discs.  And The Band's songs (\\"Orange Juice Blues (Blues For Breakfast)\\", \\"Yazoo Street Scandal\\", \\"Katie's Been Gone\\", \\"Bessie Smith\\", \\"Ain't No More Cane\\", \\"Rubin Remus\\") do not belong here.  Neither historically nor thematically.  They're part of some other album.  And they're not nearly as good.  Even the two Band songs that Dylan wrote (\\"Long Distance Operator\\" and \\"Don't You Tell Henry\\") are misplaced.  For me a song Dylan sings but did not write has a lot more business being on a Bob Dylan album than a song Bob Dylan wrote but someone else sang (except maybe \\"All The Tired Horses\\").  If you took off these songs, you'd have plenty of room on the disc for such legitimately released Basement material as Biograph's \\"The Mighty Quinn (Quinn The Eskimo)\\" and The Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3's \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and \\"Santa-Fe\\", as well as such illicit songs as \\"I'm You Teenage Prayer\\", \\"Sign On The Cross\\", \\"Get Your Rocks Off\\", \\"All You Have To Do Is Dream\\" and the superb \\"I'm Not There (1956)\\".  While the entire 5-disc bootleg The Genuine Basement Tapes (which I have not actually listened to) seems a bit much, it's probably a better representation than the officially released 1975 version.  But song selection is hardly the worst problem with The Basement Tapes.  While Bob's motorcycle accident did afford him the excuse to stop touring and slow down his lifestyle, it was not responsible for the \\"amnesia\\" that gripped Bob around this time, causing him to lose the ability to unconsciously write the kind of songs that fueled his electric heyday.  In fact, if anything, the songs on The Basement Tapes certainly do sound like a piece of and further continuation of the \\"wild mercury sound\\" of its predecessors.  Both in terms of the free-associated imagery in the lyrics and in the Blues-y Americana of the music, it certainly has a lot more in common with Blonde On Blonde than John Wesley Harding.  The main difference between the two albums is that Blonde On Blonde was recorded in a real studio, with real quality recording equipment, and sympathetic professional Nashville session musicians.  The Basement Tapes was recorded on some crappy tape recorder, in the basement of some farm, with the sloppy spotlight-stealing showboating of the Band.  There are some great (written) songs on this album, but you can hardly hear them under the murk of the tapes and the omnipresent backing vocals.  Really, compare The Basement Tapes versions of \\"Crash On The Levee (Down In The Flood)\\", \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere\\", or \\"I Shall Be Released\\" with the versions Bob recorded in 1971 with Happy Traum for the Greatest Hits, Vol. II compilation.  They're so much better, cleaner, and more audible.  A record isn't just a performance; you have to be able to hear it.  And while Bob may not have consciously went into The Basement Tapes project with the idea of ever releasing this material, and with the legends surrounding these sessions, it was probably inevitable that it would've leaked, he should've thought twice about the actual record that he did put out eight years later.the free-associated imagery in the lyrics and in the Blues-y Americana of the music, it certainly has a lot more in common with Blonde On Blonde than John Wesley Harding.

B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's latest cd is even better than the first! It has a harder edge, and some of the songs feeler darker, more punk rock like. Especially like the new song \\"Crazy\\" as it just seems to personify what beauty means in this country, and to what exteme it has become. <br />The dual disc feature is neat too. If you haven't heard of this technology, basically, the cd audio (The regular music) is on one side, and on the other are the same tracks, but in DVD-Audio quality, along with more behind the scenes stuff. Even includes lyrics to all songs! <br />If you loved the first album, or just want some new music to try, check out Still Not Getting Any...
B0000025VU|3.0|While no work of art should be judged on the basis of what it isn't, no album is more defined by what isn't on it as much as Infidels.  At first this was a good thing, because what isn't on it are any songs with an overtly Christian message.  Except for \\"Man Of Peace\\" which everybody chose to ignore (maybe the blatantly pro-Israel \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" canceled it out).  But as reports surfaced of even greater songs being recorded and not released on this record, its reputation sank.  While there are rumors of superior versions of almost every album Bob recorded languishing in the vaults, from the most beloved (the original pressing of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, the New York version of Blood On The Tracks) to the most despised (the Argentinean misprint of Down In The Groove with \\"Important Words\\" on it) none have suffered so much in comparison to what it could have been as Infidels.  And it's not hard to see why.  Not only is \\"Foot Of Pride\\" easily the equal of anything on that album, but \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" is as superior to the rest of Infidels as \\"Knocking On Heaven's Door\\" is to the remainder of ­Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid.  Although, I suppose it could always be worse, the few good songs on Infidels could've been replaced with \\"Julius And Ethel\\" or \\"Death Is Not The End\\" or \\"Lord, Save My Child\\".  In fact \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" and \\"Foot Of Pride\\" manage to be some of the best things on The Bootleg Series 1-3 on which they finally do appear.  \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" is now played live far more often than anything that did end up on the album (which didn't even get the same sort of historical revisionism that added \\"The Groom's Still Waiting At The Altar\\" do Shot Of Love).  But, what of the actual album that was released?  \\"Sweetheart Like You\\", \\"Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight\\", \\"Neighborhood Bully\\", and \\"Man Of Peace\\" are all about as unremarkable and pedestrian as anything on Planet Waves.  \\"License To Kill\\" actually is a good song, but I had no idea until I heard Tom Petty singing it at the 30th Anniversary Celebration.  This version does it no justice.  Regardless if you agree with the politics behind the rather trite and simplistic lyrics of \\"Union Sundown\\" it is actually fairly good rocking tune from a musical point of view. The only track on here that can go toe-to-toe with \\"Foot Of Pride\\" (if not \\"Blind Willie McTell\\") is \\"I And I\\".  I have no idea what it's about, but I like it.  I don't know why \\"Jokerman\\" was picked to be the single, and is still used in all the subsequent compilations (Greatest Hits Vol. III, The Essential Bob Dylan).  The whoa-oh-oh-ohs that Bob sings before the title are not only completely off, which isn't a horrible or surprising sin for Bob, but it doesn't even sound like he's missing the same notes each time.  Maybe he's going for that kind of vocal extemporizing I don't even like in the R&B singers who can really do it.  Whatever it is, it ruins the song for me.  And like the rest of Infidels, it's a disappointment.eard Tom Petty singing it at the 30th Anniversary Celebration.  This version does it no justice.

The whoa-oh-oh-ohs that Bob sings before the title are not only completely off, which isn't a horrible or surprising sin for Bob, but it doesn't even sound like he's missing the same notes each time.  Maybe he's going for that kind of vocal extemporizing I don't even like in the R&B singers who can really do it.  Whatever it is, it ruins the song for me.  And like the rest of Infidels, it's a disappointment.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|I usually don't agree with box sets that are released with extra features, or just released to squeeze money out of the consumer (Does anyone remember Star Wars Episode 1 and 2 Set... ???) But this one I'm looking forward to. Reason being? The only way any \\"hard core\\" or even fan could get mad at this box set are to the improvements to the first Matrix. Why? Well when it was released, there was no talk about a box set, but for all the rest... <br /> <br />When Reloaded was in theatres they spoke of a box set. They basically warned the general public. If you couldn't wait the year because you had to have it first, then don't buy the box set. And to put in another context... Remember when the Fellowship of the Ring came out, and then a few months later the expensive extended edition was released? Well, you could be mad then that you bought the original edition, but if you bought the first \\"Two Towers\\" and the complained when the the extended edition (same holds true for the The Return of the King), you have NO ONE to blame but yourself.  <br /> <br />My only quam with this box set is that at one point they said they were going to merge the Matrix Reloaded game movie footage into Reloaded, but opted out. Either than that... can't wait.
B0000024SD|5.0|It's kind of disappointing that Bob hedged his bets and didn't make this album all-electric.  Although the fact that he chose to put the acoustic songs on side 2 rather than first side or mixing them together sort of undercuts whatever kind of compromise he was trying to make with the die-hard folkies he was leaving.  Who knows?  This is one of my all-time favorite Dylan albums.  Bob's idea of rock'n'roll is certainly just loud, slightly sped up 12-bar blues with some strange words on top.  There's \\"Maggie's Farm\\", \\"Outlaw Blues\\", \\"On The Road Again\\".  \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" takes the 12-bars and stretches it into 24 or so to fit in all of his fun (if not terribly meaningful) words.  Clearly the rest of band - who play enthusiastically and with great talent, don't have any idea when the next chord is coming.  Listening to all of the attempt to keep up (or at least catch up) with Bob makes this some great rough-hewed risky rock that demands as many repeated listenings as something as exquisite and intricately constructed as say ­Pet Sounds.  And not that side 2 is just a bone thrown to his old audience.  \\"Gates Of Eden\\" and \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" are two of Bob's best songs ever.  And both featuring single solitary one-note blasts from the harmonica at the end of each verse to remind of you of what Bob used to do - and to let you know how much different this is.  Not that Bringing It All Back Home is perfect.  (No Dylan album is perfect.  Each has a couple of stinkers and at least one or two moments of genius.  The only question is how much of each - and how good are the rest.)  Neither \\"She Belongs To Me\\" nor \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" (which is a great title) do much for me.  Maybe I've just heard it too many times from the Byrds - and William Shatner - to really appreciate it, but I always thought that \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\".  And is it just me, or is the second guitar that is noodling around in the background of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" completely unrelated to what's going on in the rest of the song and slightly out of tune?  Whatever it is, it ruined \\"It's All Over Now\\" for me forever.  Still, a great album.All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" completely unrelated to what's going on in the rest of the song and slightly out of tune?

B00063MBU8|5.0|First of all, Simple Plan ROCKS!!! and in this album, their messages are more on the outside world, you know... like what's really going on in the world today....about people suffering on the street ..etc like in one of their songs, 'Crazy' and it's really cool to listen to these songs. Every single song are GReat!! If I have to choose which one is my favorite, I think it's the 'Untitled' song...the Video Footage, photo gallery inside the cd, it's like a bonus to all of Simple Plan fans. So, everyone out there, you should buy this album 'cause it's a GREAT STUFF!!! thanks..
B000002C2E|4.0|Bob's had a lot of comebacks.  He's comeback from periods of waiting (the motorcycle crash that preceded John Wesley Harding, the break from touring or even releasing anything other than soundtracks and compilations before Planet Waves) periods of supposed weakness (the early `70s albums that came before Blood On The Tracks, the mid-`80s albums that pre-dated Oh Mercy!) and even periods of weirdness (New Morning breaking from the shadow of Self-Portrait, Infidels breaking from the dogma of the born-again albums).  But certainly no Dylan album has had to make a return to the public consciousness of all three:  the wait (the four years since Bob's last album, seven since the he last penned an original song), the weirdness (the two acoustic folk albums) and the weak (the critically reviled Under The Red Sky).  All of that coupled with the fact that Bob nearly died during the release of Time Out Of Mind made this album a slam-dunk with the critics and fans when it came out.  And as much as I hate to be seen as a follower - they're right: Time Out Of Mind is a great album.  Plus its title taken from \\"Accidentally Like A Martyr\\" by Warren Zevon.  \\"Dirt Road Blues\\", \\"Can't Wait\\" and \\"Million Miles\\" once again find Bob subverting the 12 bar blues paradigm.  \\"Love Sick\\" and \\"Cold Irons Bound\\" are both scary cool tunes of which Daniel Lanois can really sink his teeth into.  \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" is the kind of song you'd expect Billy Joel or Garth Brooks to think would make a big hit if only someone with a decent voice were singing it, completely ignoring the fact that it's the grit in Bob's voice that gives this otherwise syrupy song its power.  Even the slower songs (\\"Standing In The Doorway\\", \\"Trying To Get To Heaven\\", and \\"'Till I Fell In Love With You\\") are as good as their counterparts on Oh Mercy!.  Really the first hour of the album is one of my favorites, but then Bob has go into the 16 minute \\"Highlands\\", making Time Out Of Mind as long as the double-record Blonde On Blonde.  And of all the Dylan epics, it's my least favorite.  There are some good lines in here talking to the waitress, but we've got ten verses or so before we even get to the diner.  The music in background is as uninteresting and repetitious as anything Bob's done.  Just skip that song, and you've got Oh Mercy! part II.On Blonde.

B00000253N|5.0|I know it seems like I'm just disagreeing with the commonly held Dylan perceptions on just about everything.  But I'm not doing it just to be contrary.  Case in point: I, like most everybody else, actually like Blood On The Tracks.  I've never heard the original New York pressing, but for my money the Minneapolis tracks fit in and work perfectly.  In fact, I can't even tell which ones were re-recorded.  I know most people like to look at this album as an emotionally raw and painful, if cathartic, album of heartbreak (much like John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band.)  But if you don't pay to much attention to the lyrics, it's a fairly upbeat, up-tempo collection of songs.  Particularly bouncy are the two songs with some of the most maudlin words: \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" and \\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\".  \\"Meet Me In The Morning\\" is yet another one of Bob's re-interpretations of the 12-bar Blues format.  In fact, even the lyrics to \\"Lily Rosemary And The Jack Of Hearts\\" are light-hearted.  Really, only \\"Idiot Wind\\" and \\"You're A Big Girl Now\\" are particularly slow, sad, or are in a minor key musically.  While \\"You're Big Girl Now\\" is one of my favorite songs on the album, I never quite understood what the big deal about \\"Idiot Wind\\" was.  It's a good song, but really the weakest one on this collection.  And it does just go on and on.  \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\", \\"Shelter From The Storm\\", and \\"Simple Twist Of Fate\\" are all bona-fide classics.  \\"Buckets Of Rain\\" not so much.  And while overall this is an unarguably great collection of songs, I don't find myself listening to it that often.  Clearly it's not because the subject matter strikes a nerve.  I don't know - maybe it's just too perfect and there are not enough weird fun little flaws to get caught up in.  Still I always do enjoy it on those rare occasions when I do play it.
0679879269|1.0|My Review may differ from others, but this is not innocent entertainment. Philip is feeding kids lies about satan and God. He is teaching Kids to rebel against their parents and authority. He is lecturing them in principles of satanicism.<br /><br />Phillip is blinding them to conform to the way of the world. This is horrific! These novels may start as simple story, but they then he sows into them witchcraft and wickedness. Please do not read these books!
B000002518|4.0|Most people see Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid as nothing more than a really long super-maxi-single for \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" with several unnecessary re-mixes of the B-Side, \\"Billy\\".  While it's hard to argue that there are any other songs on this album (or any other album by Dylan or not) as good as \\"Knockin'\\", if you're only interested in Bob for his words you're going to miss a whole lot here.  It is easily Bob's most instrumental heavy album (and since it's really a soundtrack, that's too be expected).  Most people can't even really tell these songlets apart.  Which means they miss all the fun goofy humor in the banjo-laden \\"Turkey Chase\\" (my second favorite song on the album).  And of the songs that do have words, you get three different vocal versions of \\"Billy\\" (numbered 1, 4 and 7 for some reason) as well as another instrumental.  Sure, all three offer up pretty close to identical lyrics - all which are little more than dumbed-down Cliff's Notes versions of the plot of the movie.  Musically they do each convey a subtly different mood.  Okay, \\"Billy\\" is not a particularly great song, but despite its reputation as an all-time classic, \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" actually is. And regardless of Eric Clapton or Axl Rose's attempts to steal this song, the Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid version remains the definitive one. Sure, this album is a lost great classic, but it's certainly worth more than just that one song.
B00005QK3D|3.0|Coming out from a law-suit after their label change and a huge line-up change which leaves legendary guitarist-songwriter Kai Hansen out of the band, Helloween come back with \\"Pink Bubbles Go Ape\\". A record which was bashed by music critics due to the fact that the band changed their music to a small effect when compared to their highly praised Keeper Of The Seven Keys records.     \\"Pink Bubbles...\\" admitably has a really strange, even silly title but this is not the case with the song writing. The music departs a bit from the continuous double-bass drumming stile and is enriched with more progressive and at parts mainstream ideas. Some songs are softer than the usual tracks found on the Keeper records reminding more of heavy metal than power metal, but that's not a drawback for sure.     Without diving into each and every song, I'm going to name only the outstanding ones! \\"Mankind\\" is a great-epic and progressive song with wonderful vocal and musical variations. \\"The Chance\\" is a mid-paced heavy metal anthem, which contains some of the albums best vocals and is the most known track from this relish. \\"Someone's Crying\\" is the only song that could be categorized as pure power metal (fast double-base drumming), a truly great song, which could be placed in one of their previous albums. \\"Your Turn\\" is a wonderful rock-blues ballad with great vocals and finally \\"Kids of the Century\\" is another fast song with smart lyrics and great solos.     The new guitarists R.Grapow proves to be a worthy replacement, as his guitar playing is outstanding and he also contributes some great tracks to the album. Vocalist Michael Kiske has improved even more (if that could be possible) in both technicality and emotion delivering his best vocal performance up to that point. While the other 3 band members, especially drummer Ingo and bassist Markus, continue to show how talented musicians they are.     The only drawbacks of this album are the production, which is kind of weak, making the vocals and the drums stand out above the rest (there is an EXPANDED-remastered edition available!). The other drawback tracks 1,5,9.    You should definitely give this album a chance, if you enjoyed Helloweens previous relishes, as you can see how the band progresses and doesn't continue repeating itself for the sake of record sales.     (The Expanded edition includes 4 bonus tracks and offers a great improvement of sound quality)
B0000025DI|4.0|While most of Bob's big band sound is in tact from Desire, trading the violin for the saxophone and Emmy Lou's lone back-up vocals for a trio of female gospel singers suddenly turns the ragged gypsy caravan into a slick Vegas production.  I've always been really conflicted about Street Legal.  On one hand you've got this brave new experimental band giving the songs a wide variety of possible sounds.  On the other, the LP was recorded almost as muddily and murkily as The Basement Tapes leaving most of the subtle nuances buried in the mix (subsequent attempts to re-mix the album have produced no effect audible to my ears).  On the plus side you've got three of my all-time favorite Dylan tunes: \\"Senor (Tales Of Yankee Power)\\", \\"New Pony\\", and \\"Changing Of The Guards\\".  \\"New Pony\\" even shows a return of Bob writing an entire song around one simple magnetic riff, something we haven't heard since \\"The Wicked Messenger\\" on John Wesley Harding.  However, the other two-thirds of the songs on there are as unremarkable and forgettable as Planet Waves.  The band on this album is great.  I don't know why it gets knocked as too show-biz-y.  I even liked their live At Budokan album.  I generally don't pay much attention to live albums (If the songs are too close to the original arrangements, then why not just listen to the original.  If the songs are too far off of the arrangements, then they just seem sacrilegious).  But the constant way that Bob and his quote-unquote Vegas band deconstruct and rearrange the most notable songs from Bob's catalog is both fascinated and brave, if not always successful (\\"Going, Going, Gone\\").  I find myself listening to Street Legal a lot - if just out of curiosity, though not usually enjoying it as much as I think I should.
B00063MBU8|5.0|this is a great album.  Every song is good. If you liked their first album you will love this one. The songs are better but have their same sound.  one of the better albums that have come out recently.
B0000024RQ|4.0|Bob rarely does the same thing twice (well - he rarely does the same thing three times in a row), and here on his second album he's already changing things around.  Gone are most of the covers (only \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" remains).  Instead we get a lot of Bob Dylan in his own words.  In fact two of the songs include his name in the title (\\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\").  And furthermore The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is a good album.  He manages to create a fairly wide diversity of styles with his limited instrumental palette of voice, guitar, and harmonica.  Although there is one song one here, \\"Corrina, Corrina\\", which features outside musicians - upright bass and brushed drums - for the first time (unless you count the deleted single \\"Mixed-Up Confusion\\") already showing Bob's frustration with that limitation.  While the album is best known for its finger-pointing protest songs (\\"Blowin' In The Wind\\", \\"Masters Of War\\", \\"Oxford Blues\\", and \\"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall\\"), there's a lot more to it than that.  There are a couple of great touching sad songs (the classic \\"Girl From North Country\\" and \\"Don't Think Twice\\").  And there's also a lot of fun goofy songs that are as well remembered - \\"Talkin' World War II Blues\\", \\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\\", and \\"I Shall Be Free\\".  There's also a couple examples of a common Bob Dylan M.O.: a standard 12-bar blues progression that he plays like he invented it, as a vehicle for some of his wild and wooly words: \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" and \\"Down The Highway\\".
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan has outdone themselves with there latest album, \\"Still Not Getting Any\\".  It is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time.  Every track is great and it is one of the few cd's that I can just pop in and listen to the whole thing straight through.  SP is going to get some major respect from the rock industry for this one.  Congrats Pierre, David, Jeff, Chuck, and Seb.  And you too Pat for the rockin' DVD.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Love & Theft is to Time Out Of Mind what Under The Red Sky is to Oh Mercy!: a fun, goofy follow-up to a dark, murky, serious Daniel Lanois produced comeback.  Although the perception of it has waned a little since, I don't know why Love & Theft was so hailed at first while Under The Red Sky was so reviled.  Perhaps the four years (instead of one) that separated Love & Theft from its predecessor gave rise to fears that Time Out Of Mind was going to be Bob's last big hurrah.  Maybe producing it himself with his touring band instead of using flavor-of-the-month Don Was and his stable of rock stars, helped lower expectations a bit.  Who knows?  I liked it when it first came out - and I still like it.  Lyrically it's his funniest since Another Side Of Bob Dylan.  Knock-knock jokes?  Booty call?  Hunting bare?  \\"Throw your panties over board\\"?  \\"I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time\\"?  \\"Call down to room service/ Said send up a room\\"?  I know Bob's words don't usually affect me that much, but this is great stuff.  And musically - it's all over the map (crooners, blues, `50s rockers), but thanks to the touring band backing him, it's still cohesive.  Most of the songs are more versions of the 3 (or less) chord blues (\\"Tweedle Dum & Tweedle Dee\\", \\"Summer Days\\", \\"Lonesome Day Blues\\", and \\"Honest With Me\\").  Yet, \\"Moonlight\\" and \\"Bye And Bye\\" use some the most complicated jazzy chords since \\"If Dogs Run Free\\" from New Morning.  And to keep the album from getting too monotonous, the occasional accordion, banjo or violin just shows up.  As hard as it may be to believe, Bob's latest really is one of his best.
B00063MBU8|5.0|When I first got this album on October 26 it was almost 9:00 p.m. and I knew I wouldn't have much time to listen to it once I got back home.  However in that time I listened to the whole album and was blown away.  Their sound was so mature compared to the last album and the lyrics were even better.  All around my favorite song is \\"Me Against the World\\".  Pierre's sound was amazing and the harmonies and the guitars!  I was just so blown away as I said before!  The Untitled song was definately a newer sound for the guys but I loved it.  It definately had great lyrics and showcased their many talents.  Compared to the last album this is even better :)!  The dvd side of the DualDisc was very cool.  They have little dvd moments that are absolutely hilarious!  Overall I think anyone could get something out of the album cuz I sure did!
B00000255X|4.0|Most of Bob's albums up to this point (except for Self-Portrait) sound like the rehearsal tapes of Bob's new backing band warming up for a tour.  It's just one group of musicians trying to learn a new batch of songs quickly.  And whatever you think of that particular group of musicians (Nashville's finest session men, Mike Bloomfield and Company, The Band formerly known as the Hawks), that's all your going to get on that album.  But rarely has a group of musicians so strongly imprinted a Dylan album as the ones on Desire.  If you don't like Emmy Lou Harris's vocals and Scarlet Rivera's violin, you might as well turn this album off now, there's nothing on it you'll like.  Even the best songs (\\"O Sister\\", \\"One More Cup Of Coffee\\") are sometimes hard to distinguish from the rest of the album.  Lyrically, the songs have a very cosmopolitan, international flavor to them (thanks in most part to Bob's only long term collaborator, Jacques Levy).  Musically there are some moments in here where Bob shows off a bit of sophistication (the double-time in \\"Romance In Durango\\" for example), but it's mostly just typical high-quality Bob.  While the Rolling Thunder sound does get a bit grating at times, both \\"Sara\\" and \\"Isis\\" are particularly strong - perhaps just because they manage to stick out.  \\"Hurricane\\" actually is a good song regardless of whatever factual errors the lyrics may or may not contain.  \\"Joey\\" on the other hand... while I'm often in disagreement with the rest of Dylan aficionados over Bob's over ten minute epics, at least here everyone sees my point: it's boring.  It goes on too long.  It'd be a fine song if he just cut like seven verses out of it.  Why they can only see it in \\"Joey\\" and not \\"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\\" or \\"Highlands\\" is beyond me.
0439101336|1.0|I had to read this for Language Arts last year and I absolutely hated it. No matter how many times I reread the Staves, I still couldn't understand it. It is just a bunch of details, not a tied-together broad image. If you like to get confused and are in High School or older, be my guest and read this monstrosity.
B0000024R8|4.0|Popular perception holds that Bob Dylan is first and foremost as a brilliant songwriter, an adequate guitar player, and a horrible singer.  So it's kind of a surprising to most people to hear that his first album as a complete unknown was composed almost completely made of covers.  Only two originals (\\"Song To Woody\\" and \\"Talkin' New York\\") are included.  Clearly, Columbia thought that had something in this twenty year-old's voice and guitar picking.  Not to mention his taste in traditional material.  In fact the two originals are some of the weakest tracks on here.  Both \\"House Of The Rising Sun\\" and \\"Man Of Constant Sorrow\\" are on here years before they became hits for The Animals and O Brother, Where Art Thou, respectively.  Even though Bob himself didn't actually write them his ear is impeccable.  Another great song (that still could be re-discovered and turned into a hit is) \\"In My Time Of Dyin'\\" which is also notable for being the first and only time we get to hear Bob's amazing/primitive slide guitar playing.  Why?!?  Bob Dylan is really more of a Blues album than Folk (witness songs like \\"Highway 51\\", \\"Fixin' To Die\\", and \\"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\\").  Bt was a good thing that, at that time, most people classified the album as Folk.  Which during its big early 60s boom was mired in Ivory league intellectual-ism, bright harmonies and the squeaky-clean image of say the Chad Mitchell and Kingston Trios.  None of them injected such humor as Bob into these old songs that were then considered somewhat untouchable (see \\"Pretty Peggy-O\\", \\"Freight Train Blues\\" or \\"Talkin' New York\\").  Which makes the two originals, as unimpressive as I think they are, that much more important.  He was putting himself back into the process, returning it to the rough-hewn self-made form of Woody Guthrie.  And in the process making the term folksinger to mean something closer to solo-singer-songwriter with an acoustic guitar rather than someone who actually just sings and plays the kind of songs passed on down by the oral tradition.e kind of songs passed on down by the oral tradition.
B00063MBU8|5.0|this cd is totally awesome and everyone who ever thinks about not buying it is crazy...everyone should buy it and if u dont u have no idea what ur missing...the varity of songs is really good and its just as good as there first cd!
B00063MBU8|5.0|when No Pads... came out, i had to buy it. i listened to the album day and night. when i heard that they were putting out a new album, i was so excited, i couldn't wait for the release. when it came out, i went out as fast as i could to get it. it was such an awesome cd, i couldn't listen to anything else. the lyrics are better, the music is better, there's nothing not to like about it. if you liked the first album, i suggest getting SNGA..NOW.
B000002JSN|5.0|There are two camps when it comes to Physical Graffiti.  One half will tell you the album is amongst the best in rock history, the other will tell you this was a bloated entry into empty superstardom for Zeppelin, from which they never recovered.  And there's evidence for both here - \\"In My Time of Dying\\" is rambling and, at 11 minutes, far too uninteresting for its length.  And in truth \\"The Rover\\" and \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" aren't Zeppelin's best songs.  But the reason I remain firmly entrenched in the belief that this is amongst the best records recorded is this: stack disc 2 against any album in rock history, including LZ II or LZ IV, and you'll find one of the most flawless recordings in history.  Songs like \\"Black Country Woman\\" is amongst the band's sexiest songs, \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" amongst their most tender, and \\"Ten Years Gone\\" simply amongst their best and most hauntingly sung.  So take Physical Graffiti for the perfection of disc 2, and the great bonus of owning \\"Kashmir\\" and \\"Houses of the Holy\\" - for songs of this caliber, I'll put up with a couple weak tracks.
B00063MBU8|5.0|If you liked Simple Plan's first album \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\", they you will defaninatly like this record even more!! the lyrics are alot deeper, but its got that same punk-pop feel that the band is famous for.  the band also likes this record better than the first one, and if you still think you're not sure, just buy it and i gaurentee you will NOT be disappointed!!
B000268QB2|5.0|I bought Hopes and Fears last week and since I found it incredible I bought another copy for my sister. I can't stop listening to this fantastic album, what a debut for Keane! Words are too few to express how this CD is unique, while listening to it I experienced millions of emotions and I felt like the words of the songs had been written for me alone. Chaplin' voice is the kind of voice angels have and I admitt that some tracks almost got me emotional. I recommend everyone who loves good music to buy this CD and you will never regret it, it is worth the money. Well done Keane keep up the good work!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I think Still Not Getting Any is an excellent disc. It shows a real evolution in the style of music of Simple Plan. The themes of the lyrics are a bit more mature also, dealing with loss, life and society (Crazy). I think No Pads, No Helmets,...Just Balls was also a wonderful CD and Simple Plan achieved doing even better this time. Simple Plan always ruled and will always rule. These guys rock and their two CD are really worth listening to.
B00063MBU8|5.0|ITS AWSOME!!!! AT FIRST, I DIDNT KNOW IT WOULD BE THIS COOL, BUT ONCE I BOUGHT IT, I LISTENED TO IT NON STOP TIL MY BATTERIES RAN OUT ON MY CD PLAYER... IT RELATES SO MUCH TO ME AND HOW MY LIFE REALLY IS.. AND I BET IT WILL TO OTHER TEENS TOO... SIMPLE PLAN IS MY FAVORITE BAND AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS ALBUM IS GOOD JUST CAUSE I LOVE THEM SO MUCH, BUT IT REALLY IS GREAT!! IF YOU EVEN LISTENED TO ONE OF THEIR CLIPS ON ANY SONG, YOU'LL BECOME ADDICTED ..
B000008HZB|5.0|Jeff Lynne's first solo album comes hot on the heels of producing classics like George Harrison's Cloud Nine, Roy Orbison's Mystery Girl, Tom Petty's Full Moon Fever and the Traveling Wilbury's Vol 1. This album is a pleasure from beginning to end, take Every Little Thing a perfect opener to the classic Lift Me Up which Tom Jones covered in 1994, to What Would It Take and the indian flavoured Now You're Gone. Let me say this Now You're Gone is a bloody marvel and it still gives me goosebumps after 14 years of listening to it. <br />A magical album unfortunately out of print, hopefully looking to be re-released soon. If you can pick up a copy second hand, do so, it's truly a great album from a legendary musician.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Still Not Getting Any... is an excellent second album for Simple Plan. I think the idea of having a DVD on one side is awesome, although I'm still a bit dumbfounded by it. Each song has great lyrics and awesome music with it. \\"Untitled\\" is my favorite, but that decision was a hard one to make. <br /> <br />Excellent job Simple Plan! If you don't own this album yet, I suggest you purchase it.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I love this CD. Not a day goes by that I don't listen to it! I love the songs \\"Promise\\" and \\"Me Against the World\\". All the songs are great though! The DualDisc feature is so cool too! You can play the entire CD on your DVD player if you want! How cool is that?
B00063MBU8|5.0|WOW! this cd is the best thing ever!!!! i hadnt really listened to sp before but i got this cd and havnt stopped listening to it yet i havnt stopped Watching the dvd either they are sooo awesome!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I lov this CD, it's really awesome an way better than their other cd! my Fav song is Welcome to my life. If ya like rock then your going to love Simple plan, I would get more than one cd just to give out to people. <br /> <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|oooh myyyy gosh.. if you dont have this cd... your really missing out. i swear to you you'll at least like one song on that cd. they have a great mix. different from what theyve done before. the lyrics are written just right of how anyone from the ages of their teenage years to adults could feel. i dont possible see how anyone cannot like Simple Plan. theyre greaaat.
B00063MBU8|5.0|OMG this CD is so totally rad! I haven't been able to stop listening to it since I first got it. The DVD side is so awesome. Its got backfround and lyrics and pictures and MAking Of the Record footage. IT is the best! Personally its a lot better then their first CD NO PADS....NO HELMETS....JUST BALLS.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan is one of the best bands and now \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" is one of the best albums.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Still not getting any is a step up for Simple Plan. They Have Gotten better musicly as well as grown up abit from thier last CD. Some odf the song do sound like repeats but songs like 'untitled', 'crazy' and'Perfect World' give you a surge of emotion and THAT is what im sure Simple Plan Was Aiming for. im sure thier not 'aiming' for any specific Genre but just doing what they love....making music and writing lyrics that people ca relate to as well as rock out to. I bought the Cd/DVD  album and i intend on getting 'a big package for you' thier new dvd that is came out afew monthes back. so do pay any attention to the people who bash this album. its all purely on preferance and i'll bet you that 99% of those people bashing this album either havent listened to it or dont even like thier type of music. so how can they try and judge some thing they automaticly hate? They cant. so  listen to the previews or go to [...] where you can listen to the songs i thier etirety (full album). Enjoy...
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's Still Not Getting Any is by far the best album I have purchased in a long time.  I fell in love with Simple Plan with their first single, I'd do Anything from their first album, No Pad, No Helmets, Just Balls!  I bought Still Not Getting Any the day it came out (10-26-04) and have not taken it out of the CD player.  Their songs have matured as well as their melodies.  Tracks 5, 8, and 11 are my favorites.  Everyone should check out this album, you'll be a fan forever. <br />- Lisa
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple plan's sophomore album is amazing.  Their music has grown so much since their last album.  This CD alone has such an array of music that will appeal to all audiences, from their fun dance around the room song \\"Jump\\" to the emotional heart felt song \\"Untitled\\".  You're sure to enjoy it!  So, buy it now, it will so be worth it!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Still not getting any is awesome. AS one of the songs is titled a perfect world, everything is perfect when simple plan is on the radio. I love the new cd and i hope everyone buys one. <br />
B00028HBKM|3.0|Alot of misques in historic reference as to actual events! Nevertheless not a bad story, but i consider it myth no factual evidence to support such a movie!!!!!
B0002S64OG|5.0|my older son used to watch BE videos all the time when he was younger.  but i'm now a convert to these new Baby and Parent Nursery dvds which I recently bought for our 5 month old daughter.  she absolutely LOVES them and watches even more attentively than my son used to watch his older videos...it's like magic.  and although these dvds are aimed at kids younger than 2 years, even my son at 4 years loves them.  and very important to me, the music is actually pleasant for me to hear in the background - even after listening to it for the 1000th time!  there's also a 'for parents' chapter which was surprisingly informative, even for a second time parent.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have purchased in a while.  Highly recommend everyone goes out and buys it!!
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is no review of the movie - others have done that well. I've avoided this movie for years because everyone saw it and told me all about it. Then I saw it used as an illustration of finding meaning in life. Ultimately, seeking pleasure means we never find it and it leads to death. Then we use being nice to get what we want, but our cover is blown and people feel used. Finally, we become a different person and serve and care for others, who are truly attracted to us. This movie carries these ideas through very well and does so with a winsome spirit.  <br /> <br />Interestingly, Andie McDowel, Rita in the movie, is the litmus test for Bill Murray's character. She is his vision guide and their relationship marks his progress. In the final scene, they both get what they want. Now, the question remains, does the moral strength of a good woman really have the power to change a man for the good?
B00063MBU8|5.0|this record is wicked awesome...i personally bought all three covers (n 2 dvds) as well...so i have one in the car one in my cd player n one in my stereo...it's always playing ...every single song is really good...n since i'm asked the popular question of what are my 3 fav songs of the record are...i decided i should pick three....n those would definatly be crazy, jump, and promise...if u listen to them you'd understand....this record is definatly worth the money you pay for it... <br /> <br />this record gives you a sorta at the concert feel ....you hear everything...pierre breathing in welcome to my life, the mic dropping in me against the world, just the raw like normal sounding of the words frustrated n yeah in jump, its really kewl, and really great.....9 gillizon thumbs up!
068987474X|5.0|This book is great!  It states the obvious that we just simply don't remember when we are in the situation.  Although it is difficult to hear, you realize how the obvious is so true... <br />The best thing that we can take from all of the dating situations is the lessons we learn in order to become a stronger person.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Still Not Getting Any was even better than their debut album No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls. The lyrics are the work of genious and the music is great. I highly recomend this album.
B000002UB3|5.0|Greatest album of all time.  The Beatles prove that God exists; how else can you explain them?  I look forward to one day wearing a WWTBD necklace--What Would The Beatles Do.  This album, as with all of their albums, should be sold for $500 and locked up in a cabinet separate from all other music.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plans CD blows every new CD that is out right now away. It has so muc feeling and most people can probably relate to alot of it. Its a little different then there last CD, but its just as good, if not better. Buy their CD and you will not be dissapointed!!
B00063MBU8|1.0|Wow. As a former fan of simple plan it surprises me to hear myself say that this is the worst album of all time. Why didn't I see it before? They keep writing about the same message over and over again... Kids are misunderstood, We all hate our parents. Blah di Blah hey. &quot;No one ever lies straight to your face And no one ever stabbed you in the back You might think I'm happy But I'm not gonna be ok&quot;... They've even given up on making things rhyme. Seriously Pierre, you've got to be twenty something... will you stop writing about high school kids who just hate life? They're not even his life experiences. So I'd say save your money and don't get this stupid album. I finally get the whole simple plan is a poser band thing now. I've pretty much given up fighting it, cause it's true damnit.
B0000CDL93|5.0|Stop the tape a minute, tell Mr. Zapruder to put down his camera, get comfy beside me here on this nice grassy knoll, and ignore that guy with the umbrella---he's probably one of ours---and let's ask one of the great, burning questions of our age:<br /><br />Is Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" worth a watch?<br /><br />Absolutely!---but you don't need to convene the Warren Commission to tell you that. Oliver Stone serves up a typically kinetic, visually arresting, deliciously conspiratorial and roaringly over-the-top film in \\"JFK\\", in which you're best served to worry less about historical authenticity, and just sit back and enjoy the movie for the feat of cinematic virtuosity that it is.<br /><br />Right from the start, Stone leaps in with style, wit, a well-equipped army of solid ensemble actors, and a crack team of skilled editors helmed up by his faithful Director of Photography Robert Richardson (who has worked on all of Stone's projects, from \\"Wall Street\\" to \\"Natural Born Killers\\"); Stone digs in from the beginning and goes to work with the aplomb of a natural---and gifted---storyteller.<br /><br />Stone has a little help from his friends, to be sure: Jim Marrs, (who wrote \\"Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy\\") and the still-crusading Jim Garrison (the New Orleans DA who wrote \\"On the Trail of the Assassins\\" and even appears in the film as his old nemesis, former Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren!) worked with Stone on the screenplay.<br /><br />That \\"JFK\\" is a work of passion is quite evident, and redounds to the credit of its screenwriters. That it is a work of somewhat dubious historical authenticity is, alas, not so evident---and again, that is due to the cinematic wizardry Stone works in putting you on Dealey Plaza on that sultry Dallas afternoon 40 years ago. But like the best New Orleans gumbo, it's not what's in the stew that counts, it's how it tastes---and this gumbo tastes mighty fine!<br /><br />All of this style and substance is put at the service of a contention that seems an article of faith by Stone: that President Kennedy was cut down not by a raving Marxist madman with a grudge and a mail-order rifle, but by a shadowy cabal of politicians and industrialists entrenched in the very highest levels of American government.<br /><br />\\"JFK\\" puts you at the side of young New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison(played adroitly by Kevin Costner in one of his best performances), who, four years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, begins to delive into a sordid underground of New Orleans tycoons and orgiasts, spies and con-men, Cuban exiles and CIA spooks, mercenaries and mobsters.<br /><br />His suspicion aroused, Garrison reorganizes his office into a single-minded legal SWAT team designed to investigate the shadowy New Orleans bon vivant \\"Clay Bertrand\\", who may have had a hand in a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy---and to not only question the findings of the Warren Report, but to launch an investigation into the complicity of the White House into the death of the former president.<br /><br />For all of its political immediacy and slick cinematographic techniques, \\"JFK\\" is more sweaty Southern potboiler than stern Yankee conspiracy theory, owing far more to sultry Faulknerian southern town mysteries and the forbidden, sweltering interludes of Tennessee Williams. Stone uses every resource at his disposal to ratchet up an atmosphere of oppression and menace: characters don't just talk, they sweat rivers, their eyes dart nervously about, they pace like caged tigers, the camera tracking their edgy, jerky movements.<br /><br />All of this is supported by impeccable acting: \\"JFK\\" is studded with top-drawer talent, most of whom engage in a feeding frenzy of scene-chewing. Costner is given a foil in Tommy Lee Jones at his most sardonic as the elegant and poised Clay Shaw, who exudes menace in even the most genteel purr. Kevin Bacon is creepy, sinister, and volatile as Garrison's useless 'witness' Willie O'Keefe, while Joe Pesci lets the hairpiece do the acting as the unstable David Ferrie. Jack Lemmon anticipates his \\"Glengarry\\" act as Jack Martin, condemned to be forever pistol-whipped by a hulking Ed Asner (who plays the bilious, mysterious Guy Bannister); John Candy literally sweats bullets, hides behind his Ray-Bans, and chomps a cigar. And what conspiracy theory movie is complete without an obligatory appearance by Donald Sutherland as the mysterious Agent X?<br /><br />All of this works some powerful ju-ju: the movie is spookier than a decrepit New Orleans antebellum plantation at midnight, and spicier than a pot of gumbo. The new Director's Cut restores 17 minutes of material left cut from the theatrical run, and the new bits both reinforce and detract from the power of the original. On the plus side, we get a little more of the tactics used by Garrison's shadowy enemies to knock him off the trail of the assassins, including one of his creepier close calls at the New Orleans airport. On the down side, the restored sequence featuring Garrison on a campy, kitschy talk-show hosted by John LaRoquette feels like nails on a chalkboard; it plays like parody, and does nothing but detract from the seriousness and pacing of the film.<br /><br />If \\"JFK\\" raises questions about one of the more dubious and traumatic periods of our collective American memory, that's well and good---though the viewer should beware: Stone plays fast and loose with the historical record. But in building up an account of the assassination, Stone has created a modern masterpiece, a film that transcends the limitations of its subject and produces a creepy-crawly classic.ess 'witness' Willie O'Keefe, while Joe Pesci lets the hairpiece do the acting as the unstable David Ferrie.

B00063MBU8|5.0|I love this Simple Plan album, the songs are so much more real than thier last CD. The DVD extras are totally cool and show a side of the band that isnt much seen.
1401301010|4.0|I admire Anthony for being so honest and candid about a life full of drugs and chasing drugs. As a life long fan of RHCP I can say that I love this book because of its great stories about the climb of their success. I also love it because of the incredible guts it must have taken to write this! I only gave it 4 stars out of 5 because of the few typographical errors and verb tense errors that were a bit distracting for me to read.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I absolutly loved sp's new cd.  I think the songs are even better then their first album.  The DVD that comes with it is great to.  I think the songs on this cd are easy to relate to and I love this cd.
0515125024|5.0|I have a recurrent grouse that not enough thrillers are good enough at keeping you gripped, so three cheers for this one which I couldn't put down. In fact, apart from Free by Paul Vincent I have had a lean year looking for well written page-turners and it's alreay November. Oh well, Lee Child and Paul Vincent seem to be hard working authors so we'll just need to keep buying their stuff I suppose.
B00009V7T2|5.0|After reading a few of the reviews on the front page (I didn't want to bother reading the other 300 or so) I couldn't help but notice that everyone failed to mention a few things behind the greatness of this album. First and foremost, 'De-Loused' is by far the album of the year hands down. The first two things reviewers failed to mention is the involvement of one John Frusciante and Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  <br />     What else contributed to make this album a masterpiece? How about one of the greatest producers in the industry, Rick Rubin. Do I need to mention the Peppers' \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik,\\" or the debut album of Audioslave.  <br />     Of course a great producer doesn't write the music. I was never really a huge fan of At the Drive-In. They were okay. But The Mars Volta is definately in my top 5 greatest bands, and 'De-Loused in the Comatorium' is one of the greatest albums ever made. Agreeing with another reviewer, that's including \\"The Wall.\\" And probably on the same level of \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"
B00063MBU8|5.0|This was the best cd i bought all year.This is a great cd.I love Simple plan so much!They really did good one this cd.
B000667FN8|5.0|I already loved Simple Plan befora still not getting any, but this totally made me love them even more! The  CD is entirely great, especially the last song, Untitled!
B00063MBU8|5.0|oh wow i really recomend you pick this one up i havent had so much fun and been so happy listening to one cd over and over and over again in a long time. every single song was great . i think anyone can find something on this record to really enjoy. you only need to listen to the cd once to know this is a good one.
B00063MBU8|5.0|The second effort from Simple Plan is great. It shows a growth in their musicianship and ability. Key tracks are the snarky \\"Shut Up\\", and the more thoughtful \\"Perfect World.\\" They reach out to express common angst among everyone in \\"Welcome to my Life\\" and they really connect. The bonus DVD highlights the making of the album and proves their talents. It's great to see a band actually writing and performing their own music, and doing it well!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Still Not Getting Any is one of the best cds, i have ever listened to. Welcome To My Life was the first single and if you liked it you should buy this great cd and even if you didn't like that song there are many other singles, such as Crazy, which is about how everyone in this world has changed and you will probably relate to this song as I did. The Untitled track is my personal favorite though, it is kind of different from the usual Simple Plan songs because it has a slower tempo but it still has ,like most songs on this alblum, deep lyrics. overall, this alblum will not be a waste of your time to buy and listen to. Fans of No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls will adore this alblum as well as new fans! even my Grandma likes this alblum {don't freak! she listens to most of my cds}!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I love this album because the lyrics really speak to teenagers and it has catchy sounds. Simple Plan rocks!!!! David (bass player) Is the so f-ing hot!!!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Only people who are challanged in knowing what music is talented and good like this.  If you are a moron into the most stupid music, than this CD is for you!  Every song sounds the same, and they are all about the same subject==how miserable Avril Lavigne thinks her life is.  This clearly proves that Avril Lavigne has a low IQ and can't come up with any decent lyrics besides complaints.  (OOOOOHH, how very very \\"honest\\" and \\"mature\\"!)  This is just pure and simple sh*t!!!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I saw tatu sing for some video awards thing and I fell in love with them. I checked their music out on amazon and they are awesome. I love the whole british pop thing. both of these girls have amazing voices and everyone should buy this cd. it is 100% perfection! :)
B00063MBU8|5.0|Everyone, stop what you're doing and go buy this album right now! If you liked the first one, you'll love this one! The guys have grown up more and it completely shows. My favourites are hm....pretty much all of them! :) It's an awesome album and definitely not one to be missed! GET IT NOW!!! Support SP!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I have been a SP fan from the very start. I remeber when I went out and bought 'No Pads, No Helements...Just Balls' With a title like that, who wouldnt buy it? i always knew that simple plan would be big someday and now they are. 'Still Not Getting...' is sooo awsome! it shows how they have grown up musicly. they hit the hard issues. \\"Crazy\\" is my FAVORITE song on the album because they talk about the world and how crazy it really is and how parents DO act like enmys making kids feel like it's world war 3. this cd is a display to the world saying i have issues, and I DONT CARE!!! <br />~Sarah Beck
B00063MBU8|5.0|This album is great. All the songs are so catchy. Believe me once you listen to it you can't stop. If you don't have the cd yet, i recommand you to go get it right now!!!!!!!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I really am impressed with this album i thought it cant be as good as the first but it really proved me wrong SP just keeps getting even more awesome! This CD is awesome and wourth the whole $13.00 really its something you'll like after you hear the first song your going to want to hear more...Its AWESOME GO SIMPLE PLAN!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I abosolutly loved this album! Every track is a hit, and it shows so much hard work and dedication in every song. I especially love that it's a dual disk, so we can get even more of Simple Plan through their DVD. I recommend this CD to everyone, because I know you'll all love it, it's Simple Plan at it's best!
B00006FDCD|1.0|The movie IT is one of the very worst movie adaptions that i have ever seen, doing no justice at all to the absolute grandeur of the book. IT is one of the greatest books that i have ever read; scary, thought provoking, profound, gripping, and fun, it ranks in the top five in my list of greatest books of all time. The movie, on the other hand, attempts to fit a book with over 1000 pages into three hours and fails miserably. It has it all: bad acting, (except for Tim Curry of course), loss of plot, theme, and philosophy, and horrible new ending that has nothing to do with the book. Here's a tip, screw the movie, read the book.<br /><br />Summarized reaction:<br /><br />  Wow, Tim Curry is a really good actor and plays his part really well! Too bad everything else sucks.
B0001I55OC|1.0|This movie is terrible. Half the cast can't act, especially Paul Walker. If you're looking for entertainment, READ THE BOOK!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This Simple Plan album is deffinitely the best they've ever released! It features really cool new tracks which will rock you for hours and also includes a DVD, where you can see all the band! Cool ain't it? <br />Thanx Simple Plan for being so cool and loving with your fans! <br />This CD rocks! Deffo the best CD of the year. <br />ORDER IT NOW!!! <br />Mishell xx
B00063MBU8|5.0|this is my favorite cd and i love simple plan so much!!! this cd is better than any other cd in this whole world and if you dont have this cd you have to buy it because your missing out on some good music!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I have to say that I love this album!  It totally blew me and my expectations away.  As their sophomore album, they've grown up a bit, but stay true to themselves, their sound, and, most of all, their fans.  That means a lot to us! <br /> <br />\\"One\\" has got to be my favorite song, because it has feeling and emotion without losing its rock vibe.  Not to mention it totally expresses how many of us feel. <br /> <br />\\"Crazy\\" also explores a much more sociological angle, discussing the media and its affect on the youth of today.  Finally, SP have found a message!  YAY! <br /> <br />The last thing I have to say is that if you liked their first album, you love this one!  They're still fun and upbeat, but this time there's more depth and meaning, bringing these five guys closer to their fans than ever before-unless you've seen their DVD!
B00005JMYG|3.0|Will Ferrell is one of the few actors from Saturday Night Live that actually has some talent and will have a very long movie career if he so desires (most of the other SNL actors who could have long movie careers are dead, though).  ANCHORMAN was a movie that Ferrell helped write and his comic touch is all over the screen play.  Ferrell can get laughs, but he also knows when to restrain himself and not play things so over the top. In fact, in some ways Ferrell is one of the most British American comic actors around.<br /><br />The subtitle of ANCHORMAN is \\"The Legend of Ron Burgundy\\" because the main character in the story is Burgundy (Ferrell).  Burgundy is the lead anchor for channel 4 news in San Diego during the mid 1970s.  The people of the city love him and he is adored everywhere he goes. But Burgundy lives a very lonely life, spending most of his nights alone at home talking to his dog Baxter.  Burgundy's closest friends are his co-workers from the station: reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), and sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner).  The four friends make a formidable group and are the top rated news team in San Diego.<br /><br />Burgundy's life changes the day that Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) appears at a Channel 4 party. Burgundy immediately falls for the mysterious woman but she leaves him cold. The next day Burgundy and company learn that the studio heads have hired Corningstone as a bow to the changing times as their newest reporter.  What follows is one bizarre boy meets girl story and a slight warning about romantic relationships in the workplace.<br /><br />When I first saw the previews for ANCHORMAN, I thought it was going to be a dumb movie like DODGEBALL. However, as noted earlier, Ferrell knows when to draw the line and though there are a few sexual jokes [...],the movie isn't that raunchy. Ferrell, well, Will Ferrell is Will Ferrell and he's a great comedian. Applegate turns in a great performance as the lovestruck/career-ladder climbing Corningstone. Steve Carell steals just about every scene he is as the mentally-challenged Tamland, as does the Burgundy's dog Baxter.<br /><br />ANCHORMAN has a fun time mixing up movie genres and throwing in pop culture references. In one of the best scenes of the movie, a major gang fight breaks out between the news teams at the 3 major networks, the public broadcast station, and the Hispanic station. During the fight, movie references as varied as PLANET OF THE APES and SPARTACUS are thrown in.  Later in the movie, Baxter, in a Lassie-like moment, saves some people from being ripped to shreds by a ferocious bear. Nevertheless, even with such humorous scenes such as these, ANCHORMAN remains like a typical boy meets girl story.  Keep it classy, San Diego.lovestruck/career-ladder climbing Corningstone.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Every adult or child old enough to enlist in the military or vote should see this film.It will give you a sobering picture of what we are going to be dealing with for the next four years and beyond. Michael Moore is probably the best supporter of our troops. There is so much humanity in this film. It will make you think no matter what your pre viewing belief system might be. Based on the original values of this country, Michael Moore is a true American hero and patriot.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I think it speaks volumes about the legitimacy of Moore's works when the best the right-wing idealogues can muster in opposition of his journalistic escapades is to call him names.  Yep, he's fat.  Very good of you to observe that.  Unfortunately, calling him fat doesn't lessen the shame of realizing you've been living in ignorance.   <br /> <br />Is he sensational?  You bet.  But in this day and age if you're going to get America's attention you almost have to be.  Does he ask the right questions?  Always.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a landmark piece of journalism for 21st century America - a must see for any concerned citizen who wants to know what conservative America would rather not know.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan has definitely shown their growth in their Sophomore album, \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" in all possible ways. The music is harder, the lyrics are deeper, the sound is... is fantastic. Any music loving person would appreciate such a fabulous ablum. With the typical punk sound of \\"Shut Up!\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"Thank You\\" there is also the Simple Plan touch and a mix of a few more heartfelt songs like, \\"Everytime\\", \\"Untitled\\", and \\"Crazy\\". There's a great mix of sound for every kind of person. There will be at least one song you'll enjoy on the album, if not then well you're not listening.
B000002UAU|5.0|You can see why brian wilson gave up the ghost after listening to this and essentially retired from music. Having said that it isn't the greatest album ever that would go to revolver,abbey road or ok computer. But it is probably the best psychadelic album you will ever hear. Highly recommended for those into 60s psychadelic music.
B00005JMJG|5.0|The first time I saw Enternal Sunshine, I knew it was something truly special. First, the opening sequence got my attention. I thought, \\"What kind of crazy neiborhood is this\\" as Elija Wood inexplicity knocked on Jim Carey's car window. What a delightful surprise to learn later that I had already seen the plot twist I had wished for during the middle of the movie. The last scene was truly supercharged. By then, of course, you love the characters and desparately wanted the relationship to succeed. By the second viewing, I began to notice more and more details, appreciate the beautiful musical score, the complexity and humanity of the plot. The emotional impact, if anything, was greater the second time because I better understood the relationships in this complex story. During the third viewing the dramatic tie in of the beginning and ending really hit home. Small details became clear which made them even more delightful. Close to the end of the film, why did Clemintine look at her ass in the mirror while Joel waited in the car? Of course, she fell on her butt on the ice in the opening sequence. She was looking for a bruse. How did Joel and Clemintine know to met in Montauk? They had arranged to met there during the escape to Joel's childhood, when detection and eraser was less likely. In short, by the third viewing you begin to appreciate the richness and genius of the details. The ending, of course, is quite remarkable. The emotional response actual increases with each viewing. You hear and understand what Joel is saying on the tape recording in the background and comprehend Clemintine's reaction. You understand the importance to the plot of Kirstin Durst's character. The great acting ability demonstrated by Jim Carey and Kate Winslet during this film made these these characters seem real. These truly were the performances of a lifetime for all memebers of the cast and crew.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I enjoyed SImple Plan's 1st album but this 2nd album is 10 times better...The songs have a lot more meaning when the 1st CD was more of a fun CD to listen to while on a cruising trip with your best friends!  <br />Simple Plan is one of my favorite bands & they have yet to disappoint me & this 2nd album made me more proud to be a fan!
0316666343|4.0|From the moment I picked up this novel I knew this would be a good novel to read for pleasure. I have to admit it, that I use to take about weeks to finish a book, but this one only took me a week and a half to finish. It really is a novel that goes by pretty quick. Also it really gives me an idea as to what will happen next in the story. The story really have a twist in the middle, it can keep me guessing until the last page of the novel. To me it have given me an interest to not have any commerical breaks throughout reading this novel. It has given me ideas as to what happen in the book. Also, it is a novel fill with all kinds of happiness, sadness, and love even though this main character is telling the story in heaven, in the same way it is sad but yet a happy novel to enjoy on a good day. So I encouraged you to read this novel on your own suspense and enjoy every bit of it until the end. Sit back, relax and enjoy! I know I did! Thank You!
B00005YUNY|5.0|As a long-time Yes fan I was quite hesitant to purchase this DVD; The absence of Rick Wakeman plus the inclusion of a symphony orcehstra seemed out of place and I suspected the show might be a bit pathetic. After a good friend recommended this I did purchase it and was absolutely surprised by the superb quality of the DVD - sound, track selection and overall performance. What is really great here is that this is an over 2.5 hour show that really covers their entire history; tracks from all classic albums - yes album, close to the edge, fragile, topographic oceans, relayer and later songs (owner of the lonley heart) and they are all performed by great musicians in excellent shape. Rick Wakeman is missed here but his young replacement does a great job, so you can focus on the other four. All are great - but personally I always looked at Steve Howe as the main power behind the band and as modern Rock's greatest guitarist, so for Howe's fans it's a real delight, especially his acoustic solo parts of 'mood for a day' and the movement from Vivaldi's lute concerto. The 3 tracks that I would rank as amazing are Close to the edge, Starship trooper and 'And you and I'; All other tracks are great too but on these 3 I really had a shiver when I saw these nearly 60 year old guys perform as they do...  As for the orchestra - luckily they are very mild and really contribute only in the background and do not steal the show; You can also see the players really enjoy the show - as the band members do. One last word about the DVD editing - it's excellent and it's the way a music DVD should be presented; The bonus DVD is a bit weak but who cares when you have such a great show by such a great band. Highly recommended.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I Love this CD! It has so many upbeat songs, but they all have a point! If you don't have it yet, you must go out to stores right now and get it! It even comes with a DVD! It is sooo cool! So I really suggest that you get it!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This is a pretty good CD, but it is not amazing.  Some songs, such as \\"He Wasn't\\" can get very, very annoying.  Others, however, are very, very good.  Standout tracks are \\"My Happy Ending\\" and \\"Nobody's Home\\".
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan's newest album \\"Still Not Getting Any\\" came out October 26 and in the first week, it nearly sold 140,000 copies in the US!!! \\"Welcome to My Life\\" is their new single. Which I can relate to in many ways. Ever feel like some one's constantly putting you down? Listen to \\"Shut up\\". Ever had a best friend who betrayed you? Listen to \\"Thank you\\". Don't you feel like the world and everyone in it has become materialistic?-\\"Crazy\\". I can relate to every single one of Simple Plan's song and they write songs that are exactly what i'm going through and thinkin. Everyone, show ur support and get out there and buy a MILLION COPIES of Simple Plan's new CD- Still Not Getting Any!!!!!!!!!!
B00005O5JV|3.0|In the movie titled Legally Blonde,movie release date 2001, Reese Witherspoone who plays \\"Elle Woods\\", is determined to keep her college boyfriend, Warner Huntington, played by (Matthew Davis), who breaks up with her so he can go to law school.  Elle follows Warner by getting into the same law school as him, and proving that she is more than just a pretty blonde girl with everything she wants.  As it turns out she gets more knowledge at law school than what she had expected to get.  She learned about life.   <br />   I did not feel that this movie had much of a comic affect to it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is uneasy about a little foul language, crude humor, or sexual contents or showings. I mean this girl really showed her figure off in parts of this movie.  Don't get me wrong, but the movie does have a good ending where the poor girl (Witherspoone) comes out ahead of everyone else by getting everything that Warner wanted from law school.
B0002S94OS|4.0|I have been into Lamb of God since \\"New American Gospel\\" and this is by far their most complete work.  Every track is solid.  If you are reading this and are into metal at all...pick it up.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is one of simple plans best cds ever. I love you guys
B00000ICN5|5.0|Hear this from an accomplished guitar player: when you grow up a little and stop listening to guitar music that sounds like a MIDI file with little emotion, with limited human feeling and dynamic, then you will yearn for a master. I know, I was once like you. I listened to Vito Bratta (and countless other shredder types) and although he was a Van Halen clone wannabe--right down to using the steinberg and everything--I admit he had some talent. The remake of Radar Love was fantastic save for the abysmal signing that sounded like a 12 year-old girl with a spider dropped down her dress. Why isn't Vito famous? Because he brought nothing to the table. He was one of a thousand clones who offered nothing new, swimming in a sea of clones that forgot how to play the guitar with feeling and focused on pure technique. At least if you had compared Vaughan to guitar players that have truly mastered the art of 'technique' I would have given you points. You could have mentioned Paul Gilbert, Yngwie Malmsteen, Satriani and yes even that Vai guy (personally Paul Gilbert is the best 'technique' guy on the planet. <br /> <br />But what we are referring to here is pure heart and soul; feeling. Vaughan could play with 2 broken strings having just downed 3 bottles of Nyquil and there would be more heart and soul and skill than anything Vito ever thought of releasing. Do you recall a song off of one of White Lion's last albums, a song called 'Blue Monday'? Who the hell do you think that song was written for? Stevie Ray Vaughan, right after his death. That one song had more feeling than anything Vito had ever done before because it was dedicated to a man that he knew was his superior. If you told Vito you thought he was better than Stevie Ray Vaughan, he'd laugh at you. He'd also be a little disgusted. I know I am. <br /> <br />Cobaine as a guitarist?! You have got to be kidding me! Is that what it has all been reduced to, some out of touch child that thinks Cobaine had some influence on guitar players save for drunken fits played on an out-of-tune block of wood with a jagged pick? As a guitar player I have discovered that once you learn to play scales learning blistering solos is easy, the faster it is, the easier it is to play. With songs played by true talent, it is much harder. You have to learn the notes, THEN you have to learn all of the inflections, the feeling. I could play 'Wait' in my sleep after 1 day of trying. I've been trying to get the inflections of 'Little Wing' and 'Lenny' for weeks. <br /> <br />Here's some advice: Never, NEVER post about topics you know nothing about. <br /> <br />This is one of the greatest albums of all time, and I just hate to think that someone interested in picking it up would hesitate because someone who knew nothing of true talent posted such venomous bile without qualification. If you don't believe that Stevie Ray Vaughan is one of the rare talents of our guitar history then you have a great deal to learn about true guitar playing. Look up B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Hendrix, etc. <br /> <br />Learn...
B00028HBKM|5.0|If you are religous you will feel the pain of jesus.  Even if you are not religous you can't help but think about what he went through and the sacrifice he made for his beliefs.  I am amazed at other reviewers who say this movie was bad.  The cinemetography was absolutely brilliant.  The actors were more than amazing.  You need to understand that this movie is all about the violent ending to Jesus's life.  This is not a happy feel good movie about his deeds nor was it intended to be.  The movie pulls you in and makes you feel Jesus's suffering and pain.  And to see Mary suffer watching her son be tortured to death was very gut wrenching especially if you have kids of your own.  This move has made so much money for one reason, it is excellent.  I have never been so moved by a movie.  And i am by no means religious.
6304936303|1.0|The Last Boy Scout is the kind of movie indie fans point to when they bemoan the lack of quality in Hollywood films. It's a gratuitously violent, utterly offensive and sexist pile of trash that shows why Tony Scott should not be allowed to direct another film for the rest of his life (when Top Gun is the finest film you've ever done, it says volumes about your talent or lack thereof). Bruce Willis does his usual tough guy routine, Damon Wayans shows his usual bad taste in picking projects and the whole sordid mess reeks of idiocy from top to bottom. If you like foul mouthed kids, women portrayed as either philanderers or crackheads, lots of car crashes, lots of things blowing up and bodies flying around and tons and tons of gratuitous foul language with no intelligent dialogue to go along with it, then The Last Boy Scout is for you. If, however, you have even a little bit of taste, stay as far away from this clinker as you can.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I guess with a title like that it is pretty obvious that violence is going to be found in this movie. <br />If you like well made movies and don't mind watching violence this movie is great to watch and own.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Hot lyrics, hot sounds, hot guys.  What more could you want?  This album rocks.  This is an album many of us can relate to.  The songs are about real things in life.  These guys have so much talent.  This album is a must have.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD is on of the best Cds I ever bought. Simple Plan has create music that will entrating you. You will love this CD the first time you hear it and this will make you listen to it more. It is alos a dual disc. It contains a CD side with 11 songs and a DVD side with special features, lyrics, behind the scenes, and the songs in better quality.  <br />I completely loved this album and I will encourage you to buy it 100%
B00063MBU8|5.0|This album was great! I got hooked on Simple Plan when \\"I'd do Anything\\" came out and this album was even better than the last!!! Buy it! Definitely!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I have been a Simple Plan fan for 3 years now and I would have to say that this CD is all that I could have hoped for from the guys and more. They did an amazing job, the creativity is there, and the music is to die for. As many others have said, SP's sophmore effort is definitely more grown up but all of the guys are obviously at different stages in their lives now and this reflects that. The lyrical content is awesome as usual, and if I had to pick three favorites I'd have to go with \\"Me Against The World\\", \\"Everytime\\", and \\"Perfect World\\", but gosh they are all amazing and I love them all, this CD is just amazing. I HIGHLY reccomend checking out \\"Still Not Getting Any\\", it is WELL worth your money!
B000022TSW|5.0|Although the animation appears crude, the animators have worked their little tushies off to make the Colorado town of South Park and its inhabitants some of the best drawn animations in history! If you like the show South Park then you must see this movie. It comes on DVD and that's the version I'm reviewing here.<br /><br />The four boys whose lives are depicted in South Park are Kyle, Eric, Stan and Kenny: and man, do things go wrong when they see a Canadian film with way too much dirty language for kids! (By the way, this South Park movie is a movie for adults, however fun it is. There are too many swear words and sexual situations that are not for four and five year olds.) Of course, the boys start mimicking the new found swear words and their parents and schoolteachers are outraged. The school tries to get the boys (and by now the rest of the children in South Park) to stay away from naughty words but to no avail--the kids go back to see the flick again! Their parents eventually become so enraged that they declare war on Canada through a rather mindless caricature of then President Clinton.<br /><br />The plot moves quickly and so do the jokes: the movie is extremely funny and never ceases to hold your attention. I don't want to spoil the plot too much but suffice it to say it does actually have a happy ending! There are also some interesting subplots involving the devil and Saddam Hussein--in a romantic relationship, Kenny and his experiences after his untimely passing, and Stan's crush on a girl in South Park named Wendy. For even more fun and humor, the movie pokes fun at many other plays and movies, in particular Les Miserables! The movie is also peppered with songs that are catchy and well written. In fact, the song \\"Blame Canada\\" was nominated for the Oscar in the \\"Best Music, Original Song\\" category at the year 2000 Oscar awards. (The soundtrack is available on CD, in case you're interested.)<br /><br />One gripe, however: the DVD comes with woefully few extras. Actually, all you get besides scene selections and little more is a set of three theatrical trailers. Woe is me! I would have loved deleted scenes or technical goofs to be added in here. The movie itself is only 81 minutes long so there should be more than enough room on the DVD for at least a few extras.<br /><br />Yet, after all, this movie WILL leave you wanting MORE and so far the best we can get is the TV show. Maybe, please, can we have another South Park feature film? There's never been a better time for one! GRINlly few extras.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I think we are all familiar with Tim Burton's dark intention. Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow {especially}, The Nightmare Before Christmas and other movies like that. If you ask me, Sleepy Hollow's darker, but BIG FISH comes close. It is about Edward Bloom a man of great adventures, and a vivid imagination including witches,circuses,romance, werewolves, giants, fish with human characteristics, and many other things. His son Will doesn't believe him and wants to know the truth about his father. Will gets tired of these stories and finally admits he doesn't know a single  fact. He just wants his father to tell him who he REALLY is and Will's father just says his stories are what he does and what his life was all about....
B00009V7T2|5.0|Everyone has a problem finding a band to compare these guys too. I'll tell you who you compare them to: Pink Floyd. There are two groups, IMO, who are still carrying the Pink Floyd flag in todays music scene, Tool and The Mars Volta. I know this is a debut album, but all the Floydian album tributes are there. Album theme, long drawn out instrumentals, sound effects, songs segwaying into other songs. In fact if you listen to \\"Televators\\" you can hear sounds that are eerily similar to the sounds made on PF'S \\"a cave of small furry animals draw a picture....\\" or whatever it is called from \\"UmmaGumma\\" I hope thse guys continue this trend of writing in the Floydian fashion where the individual song is not important. What is important is making an album work as a whole. This is an album you dont put into your CD player and hit random. You play it straight through from start to finish. Much like you would with a Pink Floyd CD
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD kicks ass! The guys have proved once again all the talent that they can combine to creat an awsome CD! I bought the CD...and then i had to spread the word..so i bought one for my friend! The vocals are stronger...the lyics are more powerful and the sound is absolutly amasing. This album shows that the guys are maturing as artists..but still staying true to their original roots! Good Job guys!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I've seen a lot of artists that have a really successful first album and when the second album is released, you hear a copy of the first one. But not Simple plan. <br />When i heard the first single \\"Welcome to my life\\", i though \\"it's different\\", but when i heard the entire album, \\"Still not getting any\\", i heard the best album ever, and i could notice that the guys weren't worried about making just a succesful album, but make a cool cd, with cool lyrics, and cool music. <br />I really think that the guys made an excelent job writing songs, and Bob Rock made the songs bigger as their producer. <br />They sound stronger, deeper, and most of all, they mark a real difference between \\"No pads, no helmets, just balls\\". <br />Songs like \\"Shut up\\", and \\"Welcome to my life\\", are like the connection with the old cd, \\"No pads, no helmets, just balls\\", and songs like \\"Me against the world\\" and \\"Promise\\" shows the evolution of the band; lyrically, and musically. <br />The \\"untitled\\" song specially, is the best example that the guys weren't compromised with nobody but with making real music, even if that meant leave behind guitars, and drums. <br /> <br />If you wanna hear a really good album, this must be 100% on your collection.
B00063MBU8|5.0|this cd is the best cd i have ever heard in my life its just wow. id like to thank simple plan for wrinting such great songs they are GREAT
B00005JN4F|5.0|I've been surprised to not hear more people talking about this movie!  The action (and laughs) start in the first few minutes and don't stop until the projector is turned off!  If you like action, fast cars, special effects, romance, and one laugh after another, this is the one!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I think that the album Still Not Getting Any from Simple Plan is an awesome album. I think it is so good that I bought one for my car and for my house. The songs on this album have such great messages for everyone. This album is definitely worth going out and buying. SO GO BUY IT!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD not only is better than their last album...but with out a doubt the best album period.....the songs are AWESOME....especially number 11-untitled...the songs flat out are number one! its a CD where u can listen to it none stop, and still not get tired of it..u are seriously missing out if u dont buy this CD!
B000021YQV|5.0|Ok, here's how the tracks break down. <br /> <br />1. Prison Song- 9/10 I believe this is the most political song on this album, completely bashing the modern prison system, and i completely agree with. comes with an unforgettable stop-start riff at the beginning. <br /> <br />2. Needles- 6/10 Meh, i don't like this song much. I mean, i like the music, but the lyrics are kind of half-baked. no real subject, its kind of about how some people totally take control of your life like some kind of parasite, hence the line 'pull the tapeworm out of your a**'. <br /> <br />3. Deer Dance- 11/10 BONUS POINT! oh yeah, this is it. this is the best song on the album, possibly of all SOAD. The lyrics remind me of Mr. Jack on Steal This Album!, a song that i used to be completely obsessed with, lol. its all about police brutality, which is quite true, because recently an officer shot a rubber pellet into a mob and killed a 17 year old girl, which really blew me off. i love the pre-chorus, right before Serj starts screaming 'pushing little children...' Excellent song, infinate stars. <br /> <br />4. Jet Pilot- 8/10 Even though this song has no real meaning, i think its really funny :P 'Wired through the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot' Totally random song. <br /> <br />5. X- 9/10 Short but sweet, nothing else to say. <br /> <br />6. Chop Suey!- 6/10 Yep, here we are. the big single. *takes deep breath and prepares to have food thrown at* I DONT LIKE THIS SONG MUCH. there, i said it. I think its way too repetitive, and repetitive means nu-meal, and Serj and the gang just cant drop that low. Sorry people, just my opinion... <br /> <br />7. Bounce- 8/10 A strange song about a pogo stick O_o Drug-influenced, anyone? <br /> <br />8. Forest- 9/10 Strangely, this song reminds me of Korn. im crazy you say? i mean, come on. it has the clicky bass, a fast paced heavy rythm, and refers to difficulty with social situations. and i love every korn song, so 9 out of 10 it is. <br /> <br />9. ATWA-15/10 Yeah, remember how i said that deer dance was the best song on the album? screw that. THIS is the best song on the album. It stands for Air, Trees, Water, Animals, and is about charles manson. if you know about hat he did, it is a very touching song. im telling the truth when i say that i almost cry every time i hear this song, because its just so sad to me about how when charlie wanted to spread his views on pollution to help make this world a better place, and nobody cared and just pushed him aside, he just went on a rampage and hypnotized those people into killing, hence the line 'you don't care about how i feel, i dont feel that anymore'...its just the most moving song i have ever heard. <br /> <br />10. Science- 8/10 This song is cool, but i heard somewhere that its a joke. what's with that? i think the lyrics are absolutely true... <br /> <br />11. Shimmy- 7/10 Seven out of ten for the lyrics. If you look up the words in the dictionary, this is one of the funniest songs you will ever hear. at least, it was for me. about the wacky school systems in our country. <br /> <br />12. Toxicity- 9/10 The difference between toxicity and chop suey, the two biggest singles (besides aerials) is that i really like this one. with words abot how man doesnt care about the environment and just wants to build and build and build, this song will remain true until the end. <br /> <br />13. Psycho- 7/10 PSYCHO! GROUPIE! COCAINE! CRAZY! nice. <br /> <br />14. Aerials- 9/10 See track 12.  <br /> <br />And then a bonus song at the end that i dont know how to rate. <br /> <br />The grand total is... 121/140... This album gets a B? Well, its so good im promoting it to an A :P YAY! SOAD FOREVER! <br />
B00003CX8V|5.0|Hmmm... How can I add to what has already been written?  Well, this is one of my favorite classic movies.  Jack Lemmon just nails his character so perfectly.  This was made back when acting was acting.  Oh, and to be honest... I have a crush on the young Shirley Maclaine.  \\"I love you Miss Kubelik---I absolutely adore you!\\"  :D
B00063MBU8|5.0|Still not getting any is one of the best albums i have ever listened to. SP wrote a amazing album both lyrically and musically, although you still know its SP on the album you can also hear the huge change in the way the write music and lyrics and the change is all for the better. It is a huge step up from their debut and an album all rock fans must hear.
B000002VC5|5.0|this may not be the \\"cup of tea\\" for some, but it is a magnificent album.<br /><br />what many people do not know is how far back alan parsons goes. as unbelievable as it seems, alan parsons was a producer and sound mixer for the BEATLES at abbey road studios WAY back in the day when they were using reel to reel tapes!<br /><br />you MUST try this album
B00063MBU8|5.0|its totally awesome, it rocks and theres to much to say good about it..but if u dont have it. then BUY IT!!! <br /> <br />
B00005YW4H|4.0|Nora Jones has a bedroom voice to go with her bedroom eyes. It is soft, breathy and right on pitch at all times. Her voice doesn't have much dynamic range, so it's best on intimate material. This album combines material written by her or a member of her back-up group together with several standards. The old Hank Williams' tune, \\"Cold, Cold Heart,\\" with a jazz-like accompanyment is worth the price of admission. <br />Caveat emptor: the whole CD is recorded at elevated levels, probably because of her limited dynamic range, so be prepared to turn your volume knob down from its usual setting. <br /> <br />
B0000029DD|5.0|..may very well be directly related to the fact that it is 10 years old. Some reviewers may be listening to it for the first time now, when after 10 years of age an album may be interpreted with all things current. A simple mind will even compare it to something newer. Others may try to align \\"Grace\\" with a second title from the years 1994-1995 and fail miserably in an adequate comparison. Why?  How can you compare something you have just listened to for the first time to another album you have listened to 20, 200, or 2000 times over?  <br /> <br />A very good freind suggested I listen to it a few months after it was released, and it simply shattered the way I viewed music. At a time where the music industry was being sculpted by MTV-laced \\"Image means everything\\" mentality, (which still continues to this day) this album is a breath of fresh air. There are only a handful of albums where I can instantly recall the very first time and place I listened to an album in its entirety, and this is one of them. The voice, the melodies, the serene atmosphere that surrounded you as the crispness of his words unfold in the air...  <br />\\"I lost myself on a cool damp night...\\" <br /> <br />Shortly thereafter, I gave the album as a gift to the love of my life. Being well aware of my love of music, at no point did I ever try to impose my preferences upon her. Our tastes vary, and often clash. To this day, that is the only time I have ever given a music CD to anyone. <br /> <br />For those who feel their ability to express emotion bottled up inside them at times, this is the album for you. While Jeff brings out somewhat somber and at times desperate feelings across in the songs, I dont feel that it is fair to assume this was to be his \\"Last Goodbye\\" for him musically. The surface was just being scratched. Not overproduced, what you heard on this album is nearly a 100% carbon copy of the songs as played live. That is clearly a credit to the man as a modern day singer-songwriter andcraftsman. Its not a bad thing to let your deepest emotion carry you through the creation of a song, much less on 7 songs(3 are covers). Very few do it today. <br /> <br />I wont deconstruct each song individually, as the entire album needs to be taken as a whole. The entire album speaks for itself. If you have never listened to it before, purchase this album and l-i-s-t-e-n. <br /> <br />Yes this album is one of my desert island discs, and I say it proudly.
1401301363|4.0|Nigella Lawson seems to be the kind of cookbook author who causes people to respond to *her* more than her recipes. I suppose some of that is inevitable, as she has the sort of sultry girl-next-door looks that make us ordinary women contemplate a pact with the devil. But the book is, after all, about the recipes and menu guidance she provides. And I think she does a very good job at that, indeed.<br /><br />This isn't simply a \\"holiday recipes\\" book; Lawson takes the \\"feast\\" theme to heart, and gives recipes for all sorts of occasions in which you're apt to be called to the kitchen. Sure, that includes Thanksgiving and Christmas (which she lumps together), as well as Valentine's day and Rosh Hashanah. But it also includes \\"a Georgian feast\\"  (whose menu includes green beans in herbed yogurt, walnut crescents, and a chicken stuffed with basmati, garlic, and sour cherries), several feasts for making with/for children (the Halloween recipes include a \\"slime soup\\" -- actually a pea and cheese soup), and even a set of dishes to cook for funerals and grieving friends. Not to mention feasts for oneself, such as things to cook at midnight.<br /><br />As you may have gathered, these recipes are organized by the nature of the event, which could get tedious if you wanted to look for all the soup recipes. But isn't that the point?<br /><br />The recipes -- let's get to the meat of the matter, so to speak. While I don't think I'm going to change all my traditional dishes, I'm guaranteed to be inspired by some of her suggestions. I certainly am looking forward to using up my Thanksgiving turkey leftovers in her \\"North American Salad\\" (wild rice, dried cranberries, cooked turkey, cranberry sauce, pecans and parsley). The \\"easy holiday trifle\\" -- which uses dried apricots, cardamom, and a panettone -- is likely to be my contribution to the Christmas buffet. And I'm planning to make the \\"stilton rarebit with walnut and bibb lettuce salad\\" this weekend. Hmm, maybe I'll do it _now_.<br /><br />I own a lot of cookbooks that seem to have only one or two good recipes.

B00009L1TA|1.0|Not even the obvious talents of John Travolta can help save help this mess. The plot makes little sense. Even after working back through the film with the aid of a DVD, there are too many loose ends.<br /><br />It is clear that a team of writers failed to develop an idea of where the film is going. It has the feel of a script that might of had a good idea at one stage, but just lost it further on.<br /><br />Finally, the directorial talent of John McTiernan was just squandered.
B0006213H6|1.0|This is their debut album, NOT a new release, and boy does it sound like it.  It sounds as if they were just playing around in the studio.  This is not music.  Period. <br /> <br />I bought it thinking it was their latest release, having waited with baited breath since I simply loved their last two releases.  I was sorely dissapointed.  I will most likely ignore this on my iPod from now on.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|A drug-addled, coked-up thrill-a-minute spectacle from the finest cinematographer cum director, Brian DePalma. Although many remember the \\"chainsaw\\" scene and it's violent, Hitchcock-like suspense, watch for the near-assasination scene where Tony Montana rises the the occasion. The end is very sad, but predictable considering the old political standard that \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\".
B0002SROSQ|5.0|This double CD set proves beyond any doubt that Nick Cave is the preeminent musical genius in the world bar none. Who else but Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds could bring along the core punk rock following they established with the Birthday Party, on their trek across the musical landscapes they've traversed over at least 2 decades? Nick Cave is a true lyrical poet, as well as a master of the macabre, a rock-n-roll Edgar Allan Poe. Not to diminish the role of The Bad Seeds, who are brilliant, extraordinary musicians. They make magic together. I just love Warren Ellis. This CD is a must have for any Nick Cave fan, and anyone who appreciates soul music from the vantage point of someone who is intimately acquainted with hell. With this CD, his darkness is more subtle than on others-which still doesn't say a lot given his pitch black humor. It is,as someone said, more joyful but with a melancholic edge, in a way only Nick Cave could do. I don't care for joyful music, or poetry, or literature. Sorry- I don't think I'd be such a huge Nick Cave fan if I did. So- its joyful in a way that somber people can appreciate. Another way I could describe it is the feeling you have when you've experience great loss, and come into happiness again. The euphoria is bittersweet because you know, in your bones, that the eventual loss is inevitable. But since there are 2 CDs, to try to pin the music down in any one way would be false. Its rich, multi-textured, multi-dimensional, and transcendent. The touch of the gospel choir is amazing, although I agree, its a bit too frequent for my taste. Its a small thing. My favorite Nick Cave CD is still No More Shall We Part- because its much more explicitly somber and angry, in a masterfully artistic way. It is a pure work of art. Check it out if you haven't. Anyway- I've never written a review before. I was just so inspired by Nick Cave that I had to share, thank him publicly for existing. Especially in light of the deadly superficiality of the 21st Century. Make sure to catch him live- they put on a mind blowing performance.entury.

B000002KEV|5.0|I'm pretty sure that \\"Made In Japan\\" was my first live album. The first one I owned, I mean, I wasn't in the band.    I didn't know a whole lot about Deep Purple...only \\"Smoke On The Water\\" would have rung a bell, I guess, but I really liked the album. Still do.   Opening with the punding, up-tempo \\"Highway Star\\", this is vintage Deep Purple. Richie Blackmore's guitar and Jon Lord's characteristic organ are vying for first chair, Purple had one of rock's greatest vocalist in Ian Gillan, and a top-notch rhythm section in drummer Ian Paice and bassist Roger Glover.  \\"Made In Japan\\" was recorded over three nights in 1972, and the band perform selections from \\"Deep Purple In Rock\\", \\"Fireball\\", and their highwater mark \\"Machine Head\\". This may only be a seven-track album, but it runs for over 76 minutes, complete with   numerous solos including a grand drum solo during \\"The Mule\\".    Blending thundering hard rock with strands of jazz, pop and classical music, Purple do a memorable 12-minute \\"Child In Time\\", loose but effective renditions of \\"Strange Kind Of Woman\\" and \\"Smoke On The Water\\", and a driving \\"Space Truckin'\\".   Deep Purple, and their excessive live albums in particular, may be a bit of an acquired taste...there is just as much organ here as there is guitar, and Ian Gillan's vocals may seem hysterical to some. But \\"Made In Japan\\" is a must-have for Purple fans, of course, and while those who are merely curious should probably start off with a good compilation or the \\"Machine Head\\" album, you really should give this one a try as well. This colourful album has a lot to answer for....it played no small part in making hard rock and heavy metal what it is.
B00063MBU8|5.0|this is a truely great album. every song on it is great and the dvd bonus is excellant
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan has done it again, they're second cd Still Not Getting Any... is the best yet.  On the Dualdisc you get a CD and DVD in one! The footage is is really cool, it shows behind the scenes look at recording the record. On the other side is the CD featuring upbeat in your face type songs such as Shut Up!, and the new single Welcome To My Life. Then there are other songs that are more guitar spotlight and a slower pace such as Perfect World and Everytime. This is no miss. Simple Plan has done it again.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The Grammy winning band Green Day first made mainstream success in 1994 with their album \\"Dookie\\".  This gave new and unique visions of punk music with their melodies and lyrics of humorous rebellion.  This trio since became the biggest selling punk act in music history.  Despite that, their mainstream standing began dropping noticably in the late 1990's.  Several fans began losing faith in them.  Many thought this was the end of Green Day. <br /> <br />Then in 2004, they released their fifth major-label album \\"American Idiot\\".  Their four-year interval between their previous album (\\"Warning\\") and this one proved worth the wait.  They return to the spotlight as highly respectful rockers.  Old time fans find new reasons to like them again while new fans introduce themselves to Green Day.  This explores new territory that nobody guessed would come from them.  The album title and its front cover speaks the theme for itself.  Their outspoken, risque political theme continues the legacy started by legendary punk act The Clash.  Yet, Green Day stays true to their signature rock style while adding raunchiness.  Occasionally, they experiment with different genres including 50's rock & roll and psychedelic rock.  Overall, they may have recorded the best album in the careers to date and the best punk-themed album in many years. <br /> <br />Their variety of musical themes blend wonderfully with the overall album theme and the individual song lyrics.  This album tells a story of how this country has been negatively affected by politics.  Disaster, death, drugs, discrimination, and war are only some aspects expressed.  This punk opera begins this powerful story with the song \\"American Idiot\\".  The lyrics and the performance expressions remain powerful throughout, including the two five-song medleys \\"Jesus of Surburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\".  The amazing poetry blends perfectly with the musical background.  These words, which few other artists have dared to express, earns them tremendous respect.  Never before has Green Day released an album that holds true unforgettable meaning. <br /> <br />The irateness is wonderfully expressed by all three members through their individual musical talents.  Billy Joe Armstrong gives new and deeper meaning to these lyrics through his powerful and raunchy lead vocals.  Whether he yells or \\"keeps his cool through anger\\", his trueness always prevails.  His guitar work, Mike Dirnt's bass work, and Tre Cool's drum work offer their own input in the theme. <br /> <br />Those who listen to \\"American Idiot\\" should not skip any tracks.  Otherwise, they will miss an important portion of the story.  Meanwhile, this is recommended for all rock and punk fans.  This highly addictive album is sure to please many listeners.  Its powerful message will not lose itself in several listens. <br /> <br />***Expect Green Day to receive at least three 2004 Grammy nominations: Best Rock Album, Best Hard Rock Performance (\\"American Idiot\\"), and Best Rock Song.
B000099T2L|5.0|I love almost every song on this album (except the closer i get to you, which gets a bit boring.)The first few songs have nice beats but are overplayed, and the rest of the songs are beautifully sung+written.What I dont really like about this album is that dangerously in love 2 sounds exactly the same as the first one.
B00063MBU8|5.0|My god, Simple Plan's sophmore ablum Still Not Getting Any... is GREAT!!!! No Pads, No Halments...Just Balls was an awsome album and if you loved that album you will defenitly love this one! They defenitly know how to write songs. This album is worth buying you will not be dissappointed. SO GO OUT AND BUY IT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!!  <br />SIMPLE PLAN ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD is awesome! THe songs are amazing and a great step up for Simple Plan. Songs like \\"Welcome to my Life\\", \\"Perfect World\\", \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Everytime\\" really bring a whole different perspective to Simple Plan's music. Plus, they still stick to some of the stuff you'd expect from them like their songs \\"Shut Up\\", \\"Thank You\\", \\"Jump\\". This CD is their best yet! I'd totally recommend this CD to everyone! It has my heart and it is my life. haha...GET IT!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This album is amazing! The meanings of songs vary from, love to world issues. If you have heard the first album and like it, you will love this one...and if you're listening to them for the first time, you'll also love it... <br />This album is deffinatly going to be a huge success <br />So just by it, you won't regret it
B000001ELL|4.0|When I was 10 years old I rode my bike to the record store in Cottage Grove Mn and bought this album with my allowance money.  <br />It remains one of my fave Kiss albums if not my fave. I listened to this album during those tender young years so it's easy to see why it takes me back to such wonderful times. It reminds me how much I miss the 70's.  In the months following Dynastys release I saw Kiss play live in concert at the Minneapolis Met Center which was where the huge Mega Mall of America is standing now. My first concert at 11 years old! Judas Priest was the warm up group! <br /> <br />It's somewhat dissapointing now to learn about what went on behind the scenes. It hear that Gene only played bass on one or two songs. And Peter only worked on one song at all which was \\"dirty livin.\\"  Too bad really since they are all such talented musicans as individuals. Except Gene who is very talanted as an organizer and businessman. The brains behind the band so to speak. But not much of a musican. <br /> <br />The real talent behind this album was Ace and Paul. Let's face it folks Paul is one of the greatest rock singers of all time and it REALLY SHOWS on this album.  Ace shoves his guitar riffs down your throat and sings not bad either. The controversial disco beat only shows on \\"I was made for lovin you.\\"  And it actually works out well. <br /> <br />I hear there was a session drummer for all but one song on this album and he got no credit at all.  <br /> <br />If your just starting out with Kiss it might be good to start with Destroyer or some other album.   <br /> <br />I will always love this album for the memories but that's about it. <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|I absolutely love the new Simple Plan cd. All the songs sound great and there isn't one that I want to skip over. The songs are still easy to relate to, and I think that is awesome. The guys have all gotten better with their instruments and that makes for some really great, strong music. Simple Plan is a great group and I recomend this cd to everyone!
B00005JMH2|4.0|A middle-aged lawyer (Richard Gere) battles his ennui by taking ballroom dancing lessons and developing a special relationship with a beautiful, mysterious dance instructor (Jennifer Lopez).  I loved the Japanese original, and I was highly skeptical when I learned that an American remake was being made, especially when I found out who was starring in it.  Gere is not one of my favorite actors and I am thoroughly sick of J. Lo.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised.  J. Lo spends much of the film on the sidelines being mysterious while the marvelous cast of character actors (including Stanley Tucci, Bobby Cannavale, Lisa Ann Walter, and Omar Benson Miller) get a chance to shine.  Gere is really rather charming.  The film depends on the premise that taking ballroom dance lessons could be a source of great shame for a respectable professional.  That works in a Japanese context, but is much less convincing for Americans.  I give director Peter Chelsom and screenwriter Audrey Wells credit for making it as plausible as anyone could.  Just go with it and you will find much to enjoy in this charming film./
B00063MBU8|5.0|I think that everyone should buy this cd! It has a wide variety of songs so anyone could find something they like. Also the dvd is really funny, especially the stuff that you can only get from target. It's really interesting to see how they write and record the songs! And it makes a great gift.
B000002UVZ|5.0|Oh well, no matter. No one gets R.E.M. albums for their covers. LIFE'S RICH PAGEANT contains the band's hardest rocking songs, more than a touch of their strange side and brilliant songwriting throughout.<br /><br />I recall having a mixed reaction when this first came out, but I just needed time to let it sink in. Now it's probably my favorite R.E.M. album.<br /><br />I have to disagree with critics who insist the band's best work remains on its first few releases. They claim to love originality while simultaneously praising the derivative qualities of their earliest music (in particular, the Velvet influence).<br /><br />When FABLES came out, some fans were less enthusiastic although I thought it to be their most brilliant one to date. I understand it was a difficult one for the band to record but the results are wonderful. Then, with LIFE'S, the band evolved its own sound even further, reaching far beyond the jangle-pop of previous releases.<br /><br />The breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Dinner Side\\"<br /><br />\\"Begin the Begin\\" - heavy riffage, raging feedback and a rhythm like a runaway train guide Michael Stipe's powerful, insistent vocals. *****<br /><br />\\"These Days\\" - The rock meter gets cranked up even higher on this intense follow-up to the opener. Totally rocks! *****<br /><br />\\"Fall On Me\\" - a gorgeous little number and a worthy college-rock radio staple. *****<br /><br />\\"Cuyahoga\\" - a personal favorite. R.E.M. must feel pretty passionate about this place; they sure laid down a powerful tribute to it. *****<br /><br />\\"Hyena\\" - a fun song full of melodic notes that breezes by at a swift pace. ****<br /><br />\\"Underneath the Bunker\\" - very strange Latin-flavoured tune with a bizarre distorted vocal from Stipe. ****<br /><br />\\"Supper Side\\"<br /><br />\\"The Flowers of Guatemala\\" - absolutely beautiful and strangely touching. *****<br /><br />\\"I Believe\\" - A surprising burst from a rousing banjo kicks off this fantastic rocker. Jams around a great melody from Stipe. *****<br /><br />\\"What If We Give It Away\\" - A more laid-back tune overall, this one really peaks with heartfelt choruses. *****<br /><br />\\"Just a Touch\\" - frenzied rocking along with great piano and organ touches blast this one home. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Swan Swan H\\" - Beautifully picked and strummed acoustic guitars along with a superb melody make this quasi-waltz one of the best on the album. *****<br /><br />\\"Superman\\" - another old college radio fav. One of the few cover songs R.E.M. have done, this is a totally fun song with a real 60's pop flair. *****<br /><br />I've heard this one hundreds of times. Though my musical interests have since flown in dozens of different directions, I'll always go back to old R.E.M.tfelt choruses. *****    \\"Just a Touch\\" - frenzied rocking along with great piano and organ touches blast this one home. ****1/2    \\"Swan Swan H\\" - Beautifully picked and strummed acoustic guitars along with a superb melody make this quasi-waltz one of the best on the album. *****    \\"Superman\\" - another old college radio fav. One of the few cover songs R.E.M. have done, this is a totally fun song with a real 60's pop flair. *****    I've heard this one hundreds of times. Though my musical interests have since flown in dozens of different directions, I'll always go back to old R.E.M.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Pick up Simple Plan's new record \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" It's a great album. They guys really did not disappoint their fans. It's a more mature album from their debut. They have harder-hitting songs. This album is amazing - content wise and lyrically. If you're not usually into this kind of music, this album just might change your mind.
0375507256|5.0|Wow!  This is Mitchell's third novel and it is as inventive as his previous two.  The pattern of the novel is like Russian dolls: the first story ends with the last section of the novel, the second story ends with the second to last section...  Each story is written with a completely distinct voice and in a different genre.  Each narrative is subtely tied to the narrative that precedes it or follows by the narratives themselvs (on the form of a diary, letters, a novel, a movie, etc.)  In one of the stories we meet a composer working on a sextet called \\"Cloud Atlas Sextet\\", which is written for six distinct yet overlapping voices.  The narrator of that section cannot decide if it is \\"gimmicky or revolutionary\\"?  I know what I think. <br />
0316666343|5.0|This book was extrodinary. This will sound very cliche but i could not put this novel down. Susie is a 13 year old girl who has just received her first kiss by the love of her life Ray Singh. Walking home she joyously recalls the action, suddenly George Harvey the neighbor hood loner approaches her. Since it is a cold snowy day he uses that excuse to lure her into and underground type cavern. Here he offers her a coke they awkwardly talk and then he rapes her. After the brutal sexual act susie tries to escape and is murdered by Mr. Harvey. Don't be allarmed while reading this review, i haven't given anything away because this whole episode happens in the first chapter. Its very shocking. After Susies death she starts becoming accostumed to the pleasures of being in heaven. Quietly she watches her family day after day helping them cope with her death by appearing and reappearing in shards of glass, pictures, or in the imagination. As her younger sister Lindsay grows into womanhood Susie tags along to watch the things she will never experience. This book is truely outstanding. The plot is intriguing because it tells about all the people who were deeply affected by Susies death. If this review does not encourage you to read this book then move on to the next review because i'm pretty sure everyone has a positive opinion about Lovely Bones. <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|I think everyone should go out and buy this CD. It totally rocks!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Not only is it a CD its also a DVD(dualdisc)! I love all the songs on there! Its such a great CD! Go out and support simple plan! Their such an awesome group! They are also hot guys!
B000667FN8|5.0|Wow...where do I begin with this album?    Well first off, I think it's amazing and I love it to pieces. All of the songs are great and there's not a track on here that I don't like or love. Pierre's voice, their musical ablities, as well as some other things have really improved, even though they were already really great before.    I think that they've done an amazing job on this album and it's just...wow. I haven't been able to stop listening to it since the day it came out. The lyrics and music are great and so is the DVD, although I think the making of the record section should have been more than just 20 minutes. But all-in-all, this CD is awesome and I HIGHLY recommend this.    I'm going to give a low-down on what I thought of all the songs on here:    Shut Up! - Second song I heard off of here and one of my favorites.  Welcome to My Life - First song I heard off of here and also another of my favorites. When I first heard it, I was like, \\"Wow, is that Simple Plan??\\", as lame as it may sound. But I became hooked on it and couldn't wait till the whole CD came out. I'll admit, this song had made me cry before.  Perfect World - One of my favorites. Love the lyrics.  Thank You - I can totally relate to that song, as can a lot of people also.  Me Against the World - Great lyrics.  Crazy - \\"Is everybody going crazy?\\" I also wonder about the things that are mentioned in here.  Jump - One of my favorites. I can also relate to that song.  Everytime - The lyrics are awesome on this song. It made me kind of sad when I first heard it/read the lyrics.  Promise - Personally my favorite track on the CD. I love the lyrics and Jeff's solo on here is mind-blowing.  One - Personally not one of my favorites but still an awesome song.  Untitled - Another one of my favorites. I love the lyrics and the piano/strings/etc. Definitely one of the best songs they've ever done.    So if you haven't already gotten Still Not Getting Any..., no wonder you're still not getting any! Just kidding. Sorry, that was lame. But what are you waiting for? Go out and get it!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Ok, I loved Simple Plan's first album, but I know some people didn't. This album is SO totally different from the first. This album has a song for everyone. Some songs are more up beat and will get you going for the day. Others are more emotional. Either way everyone can relate to atleast one song on this album. If you didn't like the first album PLEASE check this one out, and if you did you'll love this one!!

B0002Y4TZG|5.0|The Clash were perhaps the very embodiment of true punk, with a far higher level of musical versatility than may have been evident to the casual observer at the time. Joe Strummer and Mick Jones made a formidable songwriting partnership, with both immediacy and depth, and assimilated a huge range of musical influences. They were one of the few collection of musicians without Jamaican origins who could successfully play reggae, or their own punkish re-modelling of reggae, without sounding like an insipid imitation. As well as their own reggae or rasta-inspired Rudie Can't Fail and Jimmy Jazz, its influence is throughout and there are two reggae tunes, Danny Ray's Get Up (as Revolution Rock) and the Rulers' Wrong 'Em Boyo, which begins with a snatch of Johnny Otis' Staggerlee And Billy, just as the Rulers version did.<br /><br />They also cover Vince Taylor's rockabilly classic Brand New Cadillac. When Joe Strummer later sang with the Pogues in place of the ailing Shane MacGowan, it made perfect sense because of the impassioned folk-a-billy sensibilities also inherent in the Clash's music.<br /><br />The name London Calling comes from the call sign of the BBC's 2LO radio news bulletin, dating from 1922, and is apposite as the band send their own front-line bulletins around the globe half-a-century later. The call sign was retained by the World Service, for whom Joe Strummer was later to present record programmes right up to his untimely death.<br /><br />The title song was a single in the UK, though in the USA it became the flip of Train In Vain (Stand By Me). Astonishingly, the dazzling Train In Vain was originally written and recorded to be a free cover-mounted single for the New Musical Express, and appeared on the album as a last-minute undocumented extra track when that didn't happen.<br /><br />The double-album London Calling is an enduring masterpiece, though some of its sonic subtleties were lost in the original vinyl mastering, and far from being locked in a seventies time warp, the record sounds valid and meaningful today.<br /><br />The original re-mastered CD rectified many of the vinyl shortcomings, bringing out parts of the musical palette that had previously sounded dull, and this new re-master is at least its equal, and often superior. It also sounds leaner, as the 3-second pauses between the tracks have been excised, hence the abbreviated running time.<br /><br />The Vanilla tapes are demos recorded at a rehearsal studio in Pimlico, made in the final month before album recording proper got underway at Wessex in July 1979. Believed lost for many years they acquired legendary status, partly because Joe Strummer had at one time intimated that the demos might actually become the album, though this was mostly gamesmanship with the record label, as the sound quality is not of a releasable quality for that purpose. It is are a fascinating document of a series of songs in development, though; valuable to those with a serious interest in the band. I imagine it is disc one that will find its way back to my CD tray most frequently, but it is of course nice to have, along with the booklet, a facsimile of the original album insert and a bonus DVD, in a well presented packagerp, the record sounds valid and meaningful today. <br />The original re-mastered CD rectified many of the vinyl shortcomings, bringing out parts of the musical palette that had previously sounded dull, and this new re-master is at least its equal, and often superior.

6304806418|2.0|It was with the cast album of Evita (NOT Superstar, which I've always considered just a collection of pop songs strung together) that I fell in love with Lloyd Webber.  This movie (Hollywood can't keep its hands to itself) is embarrassingly bad IF you know the original.  The actors look silly.  Che's songs are divided up among other cast members.  Lyrics are changed and deleted.  Songs are rearranged and given to different characters from the show.  I hated it.  But.  If you do not know the original, you might like it a lot.  It has a story, and the music is just out of this world, no matter who sings it or with what desecrated lyrics.
B000084T18|2.0|first off i wanna address something prior to my review. east..187 why would you say such a horrible thing calling 2pac \\"wack\\". that's blasphemy right there. he was as real as it gets, he had quite a few positive songs, and he was one of the greatest! anyone would agree with me there. on to my review of this cd. i weep at the current state of hip hop. how did we go from notorious big to lil flip? hip hop has taken a huge plunge in terms of its lyrical prowess and it's pathetic. 50 cent doesn't help one bit. yes yes congratulations mr curtis jackson on going multiple times platinum. but why did this album sell so much? i think it was based on the fact that he dissed ja rule and that he was shot nine times and lived to tell. i mean anyone who says 50 is a lyrical beast is totally assinine. this guy is so predictable! let's see, if he talks about selling rocks he will probably mention something about glocks in the next few words. and if he mentions hoes he will probably mention about him doing shows. and if he mentions....you get my point. he is such a bad lyricist. if he came outta the south i'd understand but coming from queens? ny is respected as the breeders of lyrical geniuses but 50 is trash. stop talking about how (...)ja rule is! he beat u up and had u shot and stabbed! you're the wanksta 50 cuz u never got back at him! this album gets its 2 stars because the beats are hella good thanks to dre and eminem two of the best but this guy's living off of his \\"9 shots\\" story. i love how people gave him the name 5-0 and called 50 a snitch cuz its true. new title for this album \\"get (...)or die crying\\"
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is truly a great movie. Yeah, it's the story of Cinderella, slightly revised. I know that, you know that, enjoy it for what it is. It's really not as trite as it seems. They did a good job expanding a relatively simple, 1-dimensional story line into something more reminiscent of Pride & Prejudice, I daresay! by turning \\"Prince Charming\\" into a spoiled snob, and \\"Cinderella\\" into a modern-thinking wit. Dougray and Drew are great in their roles and have wonderful chemistry together. And the addition of Leonardo da Vinci? Perfect!<br /><br />The accents are a nice try, but in their defense, to be \\"historically\\" accurate they would've had to speak French, so let it go.<br /><br />I have seen this movie dozens of times and I'll watch it a dozen more.  It's just good fun. 5 stars!
1592400876|5.0|I laughed all the way through this book.  As a writer who went to school in the days when it was thought that teaching grammar inhibited self-expression, I found myself at a loss to say some of things I wanted to say as a writer.  After reading this book, I felt like a fount of ideas for \\"saying things well.\\"  This book would make a great gift for others who enjoy writing.  Warning: I tried the book out on several people who don't enjoy writing (as evidenced by their grammar and spelling) and they did NOT find it amusing!  But if a language-lover can't laugh while reading this book, he/she may need to bone up on his/her sense of humor!
0743201140|5.0|If you are used to reading about complex topics, you will have no trouble reading this book in two hours--it is not exactly intellectually thoroughgoing, and indeed some of its sidelines, such as the one on neurology, are so shallow that they could just as well have been left out. But apart from that criticism (or is it a criticism that a book can be read in two hours?) I only can recommend this book for its simple, but important and empowering insights. <br /> <br />Firstly, there is the observation that much of our vocabulary to describe personal differences is about weaknesses and defects and that it is high time to talk about strengths as well. Secondly, we have the insight that in order to develop what corporate strategists would call competitive advantage it is more efficient to develop strengths than to eliminate weaknesses. Both insights are quite common-sensical once you've read them, but utterly lacking in our culture. These two insights alone well justify the purchase price of the book. Together with the code for an online personality profiling of your strengths, the purchase price, the two hours it takes to read the book, and the 30 minutes to take the test will be an excellent investment for almost anyone.
B00004R7TP|5.0|I first checked out this CD at my local library. It was alright, but different and experimental. Then I checked it out again and listened to it on a road trip coming back from college. There are so many layers to this music that you just become enveloped and then enthralled by the entire work.<br /><br />Like other concept albums (The Wall, Quadrophenia, Superstar), the whole is even greater than the sum of its parts. There are phenominal songs on this album that will stick in your head and require to be heard for the rest of your life. Don't go without it.<br /><br />It will want to make you buy The Sensual World and The Red Shoes, the follow-up albums, as well. The latter albums are more approachable at first than this one, but the Kate fanatic website's poll had this album winning her \\"best ever\\" vote in a landslide. I'd also get the 2 bonus discs from her This Woman's Work box set. They are available as a bootleg, so you don't have to buy the whole darn thing. Her earlier stuff is just not as concrete as her later work. I considered it more \\"experiment for experiment's sake\\".<br /><br />Hounds of Love made her a big star, at least in the UK. It was included in special packaging with 6 bonus tracks, marking EMI's 100th anniversary, alongside other EMI artists like The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Queen. That's how I picked up this version with the extra tracks, which has now been released as a regular CD (without the EMI booklet and jewel box cardboard slipcase) to replace the original 12-track release.<br /><br />Those three albums have led me to put her at or near the top of my best female rock stars list, alongside Stevie Nicks, Heart, Madonna and Sarah McLachlan.
078681859X|5.0|My favorite books of all time are the Harry Potter series, but I do believe this series is about on the same level. It has a very unique writing style and is very entertaining.
0451529308|5.0|MY SYNOPSIS: <br />The Marchs are the picture of a happy home: with conscientious and righteous Father, who is serving the Union cause as a chaplain, and wise and generous Marmee, who watches over her girls with love and care.  Then there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who is pretty and mature; free-spirited, fiery Jo, who is determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, who always puts others before herself; and young Amy with her artistic tastes and airs.  There's also the March's lonely neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie), who befriends the girls and supplements their experiences and family. <br /> <br /> <br />MY REVIEW: This heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War visits upon themes of family, transcendence, sincerity, and duty.  In a novel based upon her own family and experiences, Louisa May Alcott chronicles the first of three books about the March family, which is the universal story of the family unit and the self in the face of the world: how each lives and how happiness prevails in morality and truth. <br /> <br />          Alcott's novel caters to all audiences, regardless of age and gender.  As a children's book, as it is often placed, Little Women serves as a record of the coming-of-age of four girls as: Amy bears injustice at school, Jo struggles with personal, literary, and romantic issues, Meg faces society and Vanity Fair, and as life threats Beth's solitude.  As a piece of classic literature, Little Women serves testimony to the emerging conscious and individual.  It's impossible to resist the gentle lessons and the charming, dimensional characters that stimulate the reader to the same awakening and discovery of value.

B0002F6BRE|3.0|If you are averse to welcoming the ever-earlier inexorable onslaught of calculated Christmas commercialism, ELF is the perfect antidote.  In fact, I predict this hilarious and genuinely warmhearted film will become a holiday family tradition much like \\"A Christmas Story\\" and \\"It's A Wonderful Life.\\"<br /><br />Will Ferrell is Buddy, a normal-sized human who as a baby crawled into Santa's toy bag and was whisked to the North Pole where he's raised as an elf.  A blissfully optimistic misfit three times the size of his adopted elf family, Buddy ultimately makes his way (in full elf regalia) to Manhatten, his birth city, where he meets his dad, a Scrooge-like James Caan and cynical eight-year-old half-brother who doesn't even believe in Santa.<br /><br />But worst of all, Elf realizes no one appears to have surrendered to the true meaning of Chritmas -- which we must assume here means innocence and selfless love.  Buddy has his work cut out for him in a series of always surprising, sometimes wild set pieces that never become sappy or smarmy or sentimental.<br /><br />It ocurred to me that Farrell plays Elf as slightly retarded or mentally challenged or maybe he has Aspergers Syndrome, a form of autism that makes a person single mindedly focused (obessesed really) and oblivious to acceptable, ordinary social interactions.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau (\\"Made,\\" \\"Swingers\\"), the film co-stars Mary Steenburgen, Zooey Deschanel, Bob Newhart, Peter Dinklage, and Ed Asner as Santa Claus.<br /><br />The two disc Infinifilm version is jam-packed with watchable extras, deleted scenes, commentaries, behind the scenes featurettes, games and DVD-ROM content.  I especially liked \\"Film School For Kids.\\"
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|Amazon wouldn't post my original review, classy.  No wonder the average review is 4 stars.  Anyways I just have to say It kills me to know that people actually like Franz Ferdinand and that people even like \\"Take me out\\"!!  Even some people who hate the CD like Take me out.  It is so terribly bad and everyone worships it for what?  Because the rhythm changes??  A rhythm change does not make a song 'pure genius' and a 'masterpiece' and a 'classic' COME ON!  Do you also consider some Britney Spears songs to be masterpieces?  I would rather listen to any Britney song than Take me out one more time. My gerbil could come up with a better main riff on guitar, definately one less annoying, and my dog could easily write better lyrics.  Don't lower your standards for music just because of everything else these days, forget the radio and buy some old Zeppelin CD's if you like hard rock. This is not rock, it is regurgitated garbage. As for the riff being copied from Trampled Underfoot, they're similar but I don't think (I may be wrong) it's a BLATANT rip-off.  Trampled Underfoot is a great song. (though monotonous, lol .. BTW it is the only monotonous Led Zep song) If copying TU was their intention, they sure did a good job of butchering it.  Thanks a lot. <br />Wake up people! This music would not be overplayed if you didn't (somehow) like it so much.  Please educate yourselves, stop living this way.
0684803356|4.0|Half of this book is a brilliant, visceral portrayal of war and the men and women who are swept up in it. It shows the different ways through which men confront their own mortality, and exposes the inherent dirtiness and corruption of war, and how this destroys hope and idealism.  <br />While some right-wing critics of this novel accuse Hemingway of romanticizing Communism, anyone who actually reads the book can see that this is simply not the case. On several occasions, the novel's main character, Robert Jordan, a volunteer soldier in the International Brigades, flashes back to his time in Madrid. In these flashbacks, we see how Robert became disillusioned with Marxist doctrine after seeing the extent of Soviet control and corruption that was rampant in the city, and how the Soviets lied to the Spanish people. One of these flashbacks includes a thinly veiled reference to the Moscow show trials, when a Soviet journalist mentions the name of Zinoviev, an executed Bolshevik, to Robert. Hemingway also shows how Communist Party structure doomed the Republican effort through the character of Andre Marty, a paranoid, inept French Communist leader who, in his power and stupidity, assigned men to impossible missions.   <br />It is shown that most of the left-wing Republican fighters were anti-Communist socialists who simply wanted to be free and to be governed fairly. Hemingway even manages to insert a criticism of American racism, when, after being told a story of how the guerilla group he has joined attacked a village and allowed the inhabitants to murder their right-wing neighbors, Robert recalls a childhood experience of seeing a black man lynched by a group of whites (this part of the story may have been inspired by Hemingway's friendship with the black poet Langston Hughes). <br />If this book was nothing more than the parts that I just described, I would have awarded it five stars. <br /> <br />However, roughly half of this book is the horribly unconvincing love story of Robert Jordan and Maria, a girl who the guerilla band saved from the Fascist forces. Maria is a flat, one-dimensional character whose only goal appears to be to submit to Robert's wishes and to pleasure him. She is weak-willed, and, for the most part, air-headed. These parts of the book drag terribly, and their only redeeming quality is Hemingway's beautiful, vivid descriptions of the mountains of Spain. For these failings, I am forced to say that this novel does not deserve five stars.
B00004S8Q9|5.0|I coulndt belive when this actually came in the mail, i got home from work and there it was!!!!!If you love those songs they wrote together on the first 2 albums then just buy it.Ray and jake together again,.....its a beautiful thing.Its raw and bluesy, alot of feeling in these songs, a little like the voodoo highway stuff.If they stired you inside before theyll do it again on this one!!!

B0001Z52RU|3.0|Ashton was a good actor in this movie. All the actors were but ... the going back and forth about a billion times was getting annoying, after the eigth time I was like when will this movie end? And when it did I was relieved. The plot was good but it was like Quantum Leap on Acid.
0451167716|4.0|The Godfather by Mario Puzo is an excellent book and a must read for anyone intrested in our countrys history. a book that goes deep into the organized crime society of america using fictional family, the corleone's, puzo spins a classic tale of love, hate , money , drugs , and the corrupt side of our country in the 1930's. when i first looked at the godfather in my schools library i just figured it was an ok book but when i could not set it down i knew that this book was going to live up to its ratings of an american classic.
B00008RH3L|1.0|Reading the reviews for this movie, I came in with high hopes - which always makes it tougher in regards to being critical of a movie. However, Miller's Crossing did not even come close to meeting my expectations. I am a fan of Coen Bros. movies in general, especially O' Brother Where Art Thou, but this one left me very disappointed. The plot was extremely predictable and the dialogue was about as cliche as you can get. Very poor character development (the main character started out with an accent, but didn't stick with it?), and very little to keep me interested. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. To compare this movie with great movies like Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, or Godfather is absolutely ridiculous. If you want to watch an enjoyable, well written mobster movie try Goodfellas, Scarface or the Untouchables, but completely avoid Miller's Crossing.
038533348X|5.0|I had to read this book for my ethics class, and it was chalked full of metaphors and symbolism in regards to society and what people tend to believe is important.  The story is a fast-paced page turner, and even though it has been decades since its publication, the issues it brings up are still very relevant today.
B00063MBU8|5.0|To me, Simple Plan's new album, Still Not Getting Any, is the answer to the feeling of being completely alone in the world. I can relate to every song on this album. My favorite song on Still Not Getting Any is \\"Welcome To My Life\\" because this song says exactly how I feel and it has a very catchy tune to it. I think that Simple Plan has grown from their debut album in their sound and in their lyrics and has continued to reach out to their fans. Unlike the latest album from Good Charlotte, Simple Plan gives hope to their fans by relating to them without making their music have a dreary, meloncholy sound to it. I also like that they did their own thing on this album and didn't make their music sound so serious like Blink-182 and Good Charlotte did this year.  <br />   I think that the song, \\"Shut Up,\\" is a great response to everyone who hates Simple Plan and those who are overly critical of them. \\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Everytime\\" are beautiful songs. While listening to this album, I feel like crying because of how well I can relate to every song and I also feel like finally someone understands me and I'm not alone. This album makes me feel like I am important because Simple Plan is representing me, and I'm sure many other people like me too, when they sing about their own experiences. <br />   One of the things I like best about this album is that Simple Plan reaches out to their fans once again and relates to them through their own experiences. What they sing about is real, not only real-life issues, but real to them personally. In other words, they sing about stuff they know about.  <br />   Over all, I think that this album is brilliantly creative.
B00005UW7G|3.0|This version of Don Giovanni is dominated by Losey's need to be recognized every minute of every scene.   <br />The three female roles are beautifully sung but the directing is so distracting that it is difficult to focus on the wonderful voices and the music. <br />As an a opera lover, I feel the director needs to enhance the audience's enjoyment of the music, not supplant it. <br />Clearly not a low budget opera, the settings are varied and beautiful if somewhat incongruous. <br />Like others that have reviewed this opera, I felt the sound was poor.  Additionally I felt the electronic modification of the weaker voices was so obvious it was amusing, as were the frantic actions the singers were performing while they were supposedly singing (ie. Raimondi sings with his mouth full of food). <br />The dinner scene and descent into hell scenes (my favorites) were weak and off focus, not at all representing the dark quality of the music.  The statue of the commendatore was a non-starter. <br />I would rate this version of Don Giovanni harsher but for the joy of the voices of Te Kanawa, Moser and Berganza.   <br />      <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Avril brings her singing skills to this album, but shows a more boring album here, Let Go was fun to listen to because of songs like Complicated and Sk8er Boi, but this album has Nobody's Home and My Happy Ending, which are good, don't get me wrong, but are not even close to as fun to listen to, this is good to add to your shopping list for hardcore Avril fans but for people who just liked but didn't love the album shouldn't buy this one, but overall a good effort for a sophomore album.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This new cd is totally awesome. There are a mix of different types of songs.
B00008H2LB|3.0|I thought I liked Linkin park alot before I listened to this CD. I love the songs \\"Numb\\", and \\"breaking the habit\\", but other than that, this CD is full of crap. The guy who raps CAN'T RAP worth a flip. None of the other songs have any good rhythm, and they are about how he got abused when he was younger. With the exception of \\"don't stay\\" which is an OK song. <br />Save yourself $13 and spend $2 to get \\"Numb\\" and \\"Breaking the Habit\\" off iTunes or something like that.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm a newer fan of Green Day, though I've heard a lot of their older songs, and so when comparing American Idiot to those albums, American Idiot is there best yet. THe songs are very well written, and there's a whole lot of depth in them. My favorite tracks were: American Idiot, Jesus of Surburbia, Holiday, Boulivard of Broken Dreams, St. Jimmy, and She's A Rebel. <br /> <br />BUY THIS CD!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album is absolutely fabulous. \\"As I am\\" is a hard, fast, <br />Megadeth-like song. The sequence \\"Vacant\\"-\\"Stream of <br />Consciousness\\"-\\"In the name of God\\" is a beautiful ballad mixed <br />with Malmsteen style guitar and keyboard solos. Bass guitar, <br />drums, everything is unbelievable. The best metal album I've <br />listened to in the last couple of years. I am completely <br />impressed...
B000667FN8|1.0|Note:  I'm not giving the band or the music one star, it's for the disc format. <br /> <br />This is the first DualDisc I've been able to try - \\"The Donnas\\" DualDisc was recalled before I had a chance to try it out. <br /> <br />The DualDisc is a dual-sided disc with CD on one side and DVD on the other.  The disc appears to be slightly thicker than standard CDs or DVDs.  This immediately caused a problem. <br /> <br />The disc loaded and played the CD side in my Ford pickup truck's factory CD player, but then got stuck when I tried to eject it.  It did the same thing in the CD player in my wife's car. <br /> <br />The disc played fine in my stereo's CD player, and the DVD side worked in my Denon DVD player, but the music on the DVD side sounded awful - much worse than the CD side.  The video content was mildly interesting, but doesn't make the problem I had with the car players any easier to live with.  Since I drive a lot for my job, I do a lot of music listening in the car. <br /> <br />I looked carefully at the cover, and in tiny writing, so small that I had to get out a magnifying glass, it says, \\"May not play on a limited number of models.\\"  So they knew there would be problems. <br /> <br />I think there's another version of this disc - one that's a real CD, with a separate DVD disc.  If I'm right about that, then I think that's the version you should buy.  Not this DualDisc thing.  They obviously haven't worked all the bugs out yet. <br />
B00029LNHS|4.0|In the modern day rap/hip-hop market, it is quite hard to find an album that is worth buying. The Black Eyed Peas' \\"Elephunk\\" is one of them. I have heard a few Black Eyed Peas songs before but never really payed that much attention to them until this album came out. Songs like \\"Hey Mama\\", \\"Let's Get It Started\\", \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"The Boogie That Be\\" alone make this release worth buying. I think that the addition of female vocalist Fergie was a good move for the guys. She brings a lot to the group and fits in perfectly. If you are in the market for a new rap record, look no further.
B00063MBU8|5.0|ok this is a sweet cd!! it's a little more mature than simple plan's first cd, it's still got the great punk sound to it! i think u should totally buy this cd! if you do you will be a happy camper!! haha! ok so the moral of my story is a)simple plan is the most awesomeist band on earth! and b)this cd rocks!!! <br /> :)
B00004YM0D|3.0|I saw the movie today and I remembered one thing about high schoolers; if a song came out over two or three years earlier it was \\"old stuff\\" to us.  \\"Ain't No Mountain\\" and \\"Act Naturally\\" likely would not have featured themselves in an early 70's (probably '71)high school.  Granted the soundtrack captured the flavor of the times and was nice to listen to (even with the Buck Owens cut) but let's be more accurate.  I think too many people too young to remember are working to compile these soundtracks and doing so in haste.
0321213351|3.0|This book is the only one of its kind that tries to use a patterns approach to refactoring. It is a good add-on to Martin Fowler's book. It's a very valuable contribution to the refactoring community. Kerievsky has a no-nonsense, down-to-earth approach to the subject of Patterns. However unlike Fowler who makes an effort to keep the code examples in his book as simple as possible, Kerievsky has made his examples over-complicated with all kinds of detailed finance domain references and the XML DOM. The example he uses to show how the Builder pattern simplifies creation of Composites is like a really heavy chapter on XML processing/generation.  <br />The \\"Replace Conditional Logic with Strategy\\" is like a chapter on Investments / Loans. It really distracts the reader's attention from the pattern or refactoring. <br />This is a shame because it is impossible to write a good book on refactoring without nice examples. It is also a bit surprising that none of the other Amazon reviews mention this issue.
B0006A9IVQ|4.0|I haven't seen the DVD version but I have seen the VHS version and even though the color was washed out, I couldn't take my eyes off Sophia Loren. Her smiles are radiant, her body incredible and her intelligent understanding of pathos breaks your heart. With the announcement of the departure of her newly-wed husband, Marcello Mastroanni, to the front, they both cook up a scheme to avoid him taken into the Italian army, but everything falls apart and from there Loren's heartbreak and search begin. She waits years, has a baby and finally decides to go to the Soviet Union to look for him. What she finds is terribly unexpected and her scene at the railway station is unforgettable and reveals why she's such a phenominal actress. (Get the hankies out for this one because you'll need them). I could see why she's been internationally acclaimed. If only she had gotten better roles. Her husband shows up one night and the two have a conversation in her dark apartment; there's no light between these two anymore, just regrets. When you think about it though, not one letter, not one photo over the years, and then the rest of what hapens to him, he's pretty much of a cad and really doesn't deserve any sympathy. Get this film if only for Loren's gut-wrenching performance.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Why George Lucas?  WHY?!?!?!?!?!?! <br /> <br />Why would you DO THIS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  Your new release is insulting.  Just leave the films alone!   <br /> <br />The most insulting part is the editing of the most CLIMATIC scene of the trilogy, where Luke removes Darth's helmet.  Lo and behold George clown edited out Shaw and stuck Hayden in.  I wanted to smash the hell out of the TV.   <br /> <br />George Lucas should not be allowed to touch his original masterpieces.  The DVDs went immeditaly into the basement, never to be touched again.    <br />
B00008S2VG|5.0|Hi My Name is Claire. <br />I became a Madonna fan around 5 years ago and now I think about it, if I didn't buy that Ray of Light album, then who knows what I would be listening to now! 18 months ago I was diagnosed with Cancer in my leg. It was a major blow to my family and I. Six months of intense chemotherapy followed, but in the end the doctors decided I had to have my leg amputated. This past year my life has been a long rollercoaster and the soundtrack to it was Madonna. Whenever I was feeling low I would stick on Like A Prayer and feel Madonna's pain in her voice at the ending of a marriage, her mothers death and her rocky relationship with her father. Ray of Light gave me a reason to embrace life and realise how lucky I am to be living after all this turmoil. <br /> <br />On Monday 21st 2003 I had come back from a session of chemo, when my mother brought me M's new album, American Life. I stuck on my headphones and listened to it all the way through. It was the most beautiful music ever especially Easy Ride and Intervention. These songs gave me hope to carry on with this fight. Well things are now looking up. :) I have started college, I'm receiving soon a better cosmetic and functioning leg and starting to enjoy life. After seeing Madge live at her Re-invention tour for the first time ever I was so happy I was there to 'boogie-woogie' with her....
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|A Christmas album without the cheese.  99% of holiday-themed releases are chock full of self-indulgent fluff and meaningless drivel.  Ian and the boys have put together an album of holiday music that goes beyond the false cheer and consumer mindlessness of the season.  Mr. Anderson realizes that on Christmas morning there are lonely people crying into their gray flannel pillows.  It's not a wholly dark work, but Tull knows that the sunshine is fleeting during wintertime.
0131103628|5.0|This is THE Book. It is written by the people who 'invented' C. I own all three versions of this book, the original edition, the draft ANSI C edition, and the 'final' ANSI C edition. <br /> <br />This book is very concise (it is less than 1/2\\" thick) so in some chapters it requires careful reading. But it is information straight from the source. As a language book it doesn't dive into the standard C libraries or things normally associated with UNIX programming. But that is OK, its a book on programming in C, not a book on applied C programming. I have other C books, that are thicker (than my three editions of The C Programming Language put together), which don't even come close to the quality of the instruction these books provide.
B000002OZY|5.0|This, of course, it the Who's most famous album.  Whether or not it's their best album is debatable, but nevertheless it's a great album.
