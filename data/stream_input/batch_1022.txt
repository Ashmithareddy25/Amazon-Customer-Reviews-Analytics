0618680004|5.0|Before reading this book, I would have considered myself agnostic, and before that a very religious-minded Christian. I had been having substantial doubts through my first year of college, yet couldn't quite make the immense jump to an atheistic world view just yet. This book was the perfect kick-start.    I believe Dawkins couldn't have possibly done a better job with one particular aspect of the book: its sequence. By beginning the book with a review of the respect that religion gets but doesn't deserve, he sets up the religious reader for the required religious skepticism that is needed to continue on unhindered with the book. He then discusses how atheism has such a negative connotation and reputation associated with it that it certainly hasn't deserved. By making this stark contrast visible between atheism's lack of respect and religion's unfair portion of respect, Dawkins gets the reader's attention very quickly off of any religious preconceived notion concerning atheists.    Although his arguments against the existence of God sometimes leave a little to be desired, overall his approach is very effective. His 2 pages on the mathematical argument for God's existence was the most disappointing in my view, but he still does not fail to address the problem appropriately and fairly convincingly. The main point of this portion of the book is to rid the religious person's mind of any of the arguments they have most likely been submersed in their entire lives.    The most interesting aspect of this book in my opinion is the section on morality. Many Christians who were raised in a church have probably never questioned the morality of the Bible, yet Dawkins does a splendid job of pointing out the horrors of the old and new testament alike: the brutality of god, the evolution of morality, the indoctrination of children, etc. I would recommend \\"The Evolution of Morality\\" by Richard Joyce for anyone who finds this section as appealing as I did.     For many die-hard Christians, this book may not have the ability to convert you in one swift stroke or be able to perform any other \\"miracle\\" of such drastic sorts. But for the doubters, skeptics, and the rest of us, the book does not fail to disappoint or openly confront what we may have not had the courage to confront ourselves.

B000SQKZKG|1.0|Don't get me wrong.  I have Shout Factory's release of the eponymous first album, which I dearly love.  Trilogy has it's momemnts, and Works is...well, that's another review.  But this album, though nicely recorded, reflects the band as stage-stricken with their own hype, and one cannot help but be saddened that the band's edgy creativity became muted when the phony rhinestone glitz got in the way of the expression of true musical genius.  The title itself was enough to turn me off, and rather than wait for still more self-indulgent hype, I turned to Bartok and Zappa.  But enough said.  If you like this album, don't miss out on the Kiss and Andy Gibb albums.

B000002GBJ|1.0|I roll my eyes every time I hear someone speak about Ricky's \\"musical textures.\\"  This is still another example of Wakeman's pretentious attempt to become known as a \\"serious rock musician.\\"  In the words of a famous Roman emperor, \\"I listened, I broke up laughing, I kept the receipt and got my dough back from the record store.\\"  This album is the Pulp Fiction of progressive rock, the Mickey Spillane in a genre otherwise mostly populated with artists with a sincere vision and edgy creativity.  If Anne Boleyn could have known that this album was on its way in the future, she'd have spared Henry VIII the trouble and simply hanged herself.  A truly laughable stinker!
B001795SH8|5.0|I agree with most of what the previews reviews already said about this set. Overall it's very good if you like Abbado's approach to Beethoven - light and breezy and transparent. Abbado uses a smaller orchestra for most of these works, so you'll have to adjust to the smaller, less weighty sound than say, Gunter Wand's excellent set. One minor quibble is that Abbado, or the engineers, don't provide enough low end for my taste. The bass is a little weak on these recordings, which may be part of Abbado's approach. That aside, I like these performances a lot. One point where this set scores higher than Vanska is that this set doesn't suffer from Vanska's obsession with soft dynamics. In the Vanska recordings the pianissimos are so low, the recording drops down to almost nothing. Abbado has better dynamics for home listening. A few of Abbado's tempos are pretty fast (last movements of 4 & 7 for example) but they are exciting, and I think Beethoven's music can handle it. I'm not an Abbado fan by any means, but this set is better than most of his uneven work. There are some single performances that I may slightly prefer to Abbado, but this set will join Wand and Mackerras's first set on my shelf.
B000002GA8|1.0|This album stinks, and is precisely the kind of self-indulgent nincompoopery that destroyed the credibility of progressive rock (to be fair, one must cite Ketih Emerson's twirling piano antics in 1974 as being right up there, too!) and turned otherwise thoughtful listeners into the arms of less pretentious artists that didn't appear on stage with golden capes, masks and other dumb-assed stage props that probably embarasses Wakeman and his ilk today.  The wonder of music is the music, not in the hype.  This effort from young Ricky makes it evident just how caught up in himself he was, and it's nice to see that he grew out of such silliness to make fine music later on.  I heard this drivel when I worked at a Licorice Pizza store in Downey, CA in the mid seventies, and we all giggled at the notion of still another Wakeman album that delved deeper into the musical sewage that the record companies thought that \\"the kids will buy.\\"  How it made its way onto CD is beyond me.  But hey--if it made Wakeman a few bucks, then why not, I suppose.  Some guys go into professional wrestling, others play keyboards, while still others wax rhapsodic about the \\"genius\\" behind this steaming pool of fetid vomit.  Pew!!
B000P0J024|5.0|A great collection of singers, Dylan (when he still had a voice), Orbison and Harrison (when they were still alive),  Lyne and Petty.  It would be tough to go wrong with this band.  Back when music was more than DJ's and vocoders.  A blast from the past.
0440243688|2.0|After reading this book I was a bit disappointed. The opening of the book, that is also portrayed on the book jacket is by far the best part. From there the plot just is not up to the task of providing for a book that is 540 pages long (in paperback).<br /><br />The plot is extremly thin, and it feels outplayed half way throug the book. But then there is a twist to prolong the whole story with 100%. This twist is as thin as the first apparent plot, and to my disapointment the end is even whorse than the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Jack Reacher (the main characther) is to me a one-dimensional kind of guy, and a lot of the book is thold through first person. That means that long sections of the book is composed of \\"then I did that, and then I saw that, and then I did that, and then I.... and so forth.\\" This does not make a good book for me, and even if it did not take me to long to read through the book, it left me wanting for a lot more.<br /><br />There would have been a lot more to the book if the stories of the two ladies where elaborated a lot more. As it was, there was some bogus coverstory for them, that at first seemed plausible. But I never really got to know who they where and what drove them (other than the obvious reason that is so overused, religion).<br /><br />I almost had to laugh when Jack Reacher managed to deduct to where the ladies and there companions where in Manhattan. Reacher must be some sort of superman to by deductuion find out that they HAD to be at JUST THIS place, since they should have gone off at one of two subway stops. As the author himself proclaimed, it was 2 million places they could be, but reacher found out by guessing. The whole thing became even more laughable when the senator's right hand, mr Springfield, made the exact same deduction at the exact same time.<br /><br />There is a lot of other books out there that are worth reading before you decide to read this one, but Jack Reacher has some appeal. Unfortunatly this is not a boook where he shines.
B001CU1RRM|5.0|This is an excellent compilation album of Michael Jackson's so many timeless hits. I have all MJ's individual albums including other compilation albums, but I had to have this one because this has \\"Say, Say, Say\\", that I always wanted to have. I listen to other artists' music too, but what can I say? Michael Jackson's music is simply the best! Highly recommended!
B0001I561E|4.0|Aladdin (1992) will either knock the socks off viewers, or confound  them as an incomprehensible cartoon and musical or finally,  constitute a piece of art for creators of art, in the sense that so  much is packed into the product, from an artistic point of view and  the manner in which it is done, that it  suggests this release was  not entirely designed for the mass market or to have a mass appeal.    First, the spectacular is definitely here,  starting with the  top-quality animation work (colors, flow, designs, accuracy and  style of the drawings) which is expected from Disney. The historic  parallel story told about \\"Alladin\\" is woven into this script, with  entertainment being the overwhelming concern - a totally correct  decision. Those elements add up such that they satisfy paying  consumers and boost the replay value immensely.    From an audio point of view,  the jingle is immediately recognizable  as an Aerosmith's number ( \\"Rag Doll, livin' in a movie ... so fine  they'll never see ya leavin' by the back door\\"), here rerecorded  with a Louis Armstrong style and instrumentation.    Secondly, a not small part of the story is farfetched, with no  imaginative boundaries ... this definitely takes this movie into a  completely other dimension, bringing it ever closer to what everyone  knows as dreams. Being incomprehensible is perhaps intentional, in  the sense that this picture is not designed ONLY for youths, but  also for parents and grown ups, both who will find themselves  laughing out loud, chuckling and amazed at the many sequences  throughout the 90 minutes. Some parts are sincere but hard-hitting,  tender and brutal at the same time.    Finally, the wide-ranging, not timid and no-limits of the story,  much of it resulting from observation immersed in reality, calls  forth other emotions - sarcasm,  parody or mockery of certain  cultural elements of non-Western countries. Examples is the concept  of pre-arranged marriages, monarchies, strong arm guards, beheadings  for minor misakes, a camel shown with a tongue hanging out from  overwork and thirst,  social caste systems, etc.    Or in other words, a fair bit seems extreme and not essential to a  cartoon, so that no doubt a part of the audience may find them  politically incorrect or controversial and out of step with the 21st  century.    The often heard shouting raises eyebrows, considering that the  script concerns the romance between Aladdin and a princess.    Taken together, the script rises above and beyond the mainstream,  which is why, perhaps, this movie is an artist's art . designed for  those who are jaded about revisiting again a classic story. e.g. a  showbiz style of speech is used at times to parody certain moments  in the able    In sum,  this is a  film that nobody could have predicted .. a curve  ball turned into a home run.
0199535639|4.0|Walter Hartright, one of the main characters in The Woman in White, is one of those unlikely heroes who you just cannot help but fall in love with. Art is his passion, and he's a rather quiet gentleman with kindness for everyone. However, as the story continues on, Walter shows intense courage, passion, and love in the events that change his life forever.<br /><br />This book was writting differently than the majority of books. As the mystery unfolds, each character gives one or more account of what they have seen, heard, and/or carefully observed. (So when the first account comes to an end, don't be shocked.) This way of presenting a story really works to convey the suspense - and danger - of the situations the characters are in. It gives the characters life, more personality.<br /><br />I'm not going to give a synopsis. When I read the synopsis on the back of the copy I bought, it gave me a completely different idea of what the story was going to be like than what it actually was. (That frustrates me immensely.) All I can say, besides, \\"Go read this book!\\", is that it is full of adventure, intrique, romance and mystery. It is light and it is dark; it is fast-paced and it is emotional. I never lost interest. When I was done with it, I was so glad I had read it. It truly is a classic.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|My kids liked this one.  \\"A Kid movie\\" meaning that it was entirely predictible and often had silly conveniences to make the plot work.  Despite having gods and demi gods and very interesting historical characters it often was flat and unimaginative.  Under 10 years old. It's clean and without \\"inappropriate\\" language or sex to offend. Violence is scary for little ones.
0142004235|5.0|I have to say that this book came as a surprise to me. I saw the movie recently and was spell-bound so went and got the book immediately, and have to say that it is now actually the best book I've ever read. Personally, anyway. Something you have to understand, it is a very easy book to read. While lots of acclaimed books have pages upon pages of impossibly tiresome 'details' of the most uninteresting things, the pages in this are told simply through stories, as if Steinbeck is telling it over a coffee to a friend. There's none of the \\"the stalks were high and brown, and the golden sunlight lit the condensation like a miracle from the sky\\" nonsense to fill out pages. Everything Steinbeck explains is told so through one story after another, and in that way it is easy to see that this is clearly quite a documentation of his own life and memories. Which I personally think is the most wonderful form of storytelling. The characters are great, too. The first part has a chapter where one brother goes out with a hatchet to murder his other brother. Then not too long after we hear the tale of the most wicked woman ever created, Cathy, who kills her parents by lighting their house on fire. This is gripping, intriguing stuff. I can't believe it was written so long ago. I've never been much of a fan of Steinbeck's until now (we had to read Of Mice and Men in high school and that was okay), but now I have the great urge to buy all his books and have the time of my life all over again.

0553381687|4.0|There are a lot of great things about this book, and if nothing else, it is worth reading just to get into the series. However, it has some drawbacks that make it not quite as good as the next two books in the series.<br /><br />Great things:<br /><br />The subplot of Daenerys won a Hugo Award, and it is well-deserved.  Her story is amazing, even as a stand-alone short story.<br /><br />Martin does an impressive job of moving quickly between characters.  Having each chapter from the viewpoint of a different character helps with that.  He will focus on one character for a chapter, switch to another for the next chapter, and then when he goes back to the first, he fills you in as events have continued progressing in the meantime for the previous character.  This gives the sense that the world is constantly in action and you are moving from window to window viewing parts of it at a time.  Martin also keeps most of the chapters short enough that you do not get unnecessarily bogged down, unlike some other fantasy epics that seem to have hundreds of pages of exposition.<br /><br />The tone is set very early in this book that it is a dark and dangerous world, and any character can die, no matter how pivotal they seem to be to the plot.  In most books, it is fairly clear that the author will not kill off the main protagonists, making it much less tense when their lives are supposedly in jeopardy.  Not so here - Martin really will kill off anyone at any time.<br /><br />Bad things:<br /><br />Martin seems to still be working out some writing fundamentals in this first book.  The most jarring example of this to me is his overuse of pronouns, which is a common mistake amongst novice writers, usually students.  For example (not from the book, so as to avoid any spoilers):  \\"When he came into the room, he saw that his two brothers Jon and Jeremy were wrestling.  He pinned him down just before he stopped the fight by pulling him to the side and shoving him out the door.\\"  At best, these sorts of passages make you stare until you can figure out who is who from the context.  At worst, it's impossible to tell who's who from the context and you have to just give up and move on.<br /><br />He also seems to be obsessed with nipples.  I wasn't quite as disturbed as some other reviewers I've read, but it was definitely jarring when all of the sudden he would feel the need to insert another nipple-pinching scene.<br /><br />Final good thing:  The fundamental writing problems get better in the second book and seem absent from the third, and I didn't notice any unnecessary nipple pinching in subsequent books.til you can figure out who is who from the context.

B003GDYN24|5.0|Kelis stands on her own and has always been a little different from the rest of the artists out there.   She explores and revels in her uniqueness on 'Flesh Tone' and has released an album so real and refreshing that I can not stop raving about its greatness.   This album is a true work of art.    When she debuted in 1999 with the song 'Caught Out There', she garnered attention for being different, got some rotation on MTV, but mainly took off in the UK, as did the rest of the singles from that album. Her next album was released outside of the US in 2001, when the first single failed to take off in the states. Then came 'Milkshake' in 2003. That song made her name known. When she followed up with 'Bossy' in 2006, it too, was infectious.   I appreciate that Kelis. I love that Kelis.  She was sassy, beautiful, and had an amazing voice to back it all up with.    However, I feel that Kelis shows who she REALLY is on 'Flesh Tone' and it's a side of her that has me hooked and even more in love.   She still possesses the amazing voice, but this time around, she conveys her message so poetically and maturely. She manages to do this all to the beats provided by great DJ's David Guetta, Benny Benassi, and Jean Baptiste. The hooks and beats on each song are stellar. I appreciate that 'Flesh Tone' isn't clouded with fillers and every song stands on its own. You could play this record at a club, from start to finish, and have the dance floor full through it's entirety. It's that good.    'Flesh Tone' is a different direction and sound for Kelis and I can't applaud her enough for taking the risk. I believe a true artist takes risks; Kelis has proven that she is a TRUE artist with this record. She also astounded me with the videos for the first two singles, 'Acapella' and '4th of July (Fireworks)'   These two videos seal the deal.   If you haven't seen them yet, they are groundbreaking in originality and beauty. They capture the essence that is 'Flesh Tone'    I'm glad that I \\"get\\" this album. It's groundbreaking, risk taking, and the epitome of a true dance record.    Like Kelis says....\\"welcome to the 22nd century\\"

B003NX76BM|4.0|A good romance book, not one of Nora's usual but a good book. I enjoyed this and would recommend to all.
0756405890|5.0|I read the Song of Ice and Fire quartet recently and, having been sucked into the fantasy world, looked for another book to quench my thirst.    Amazon recommended \\"The Name of the Wind,\\" and it was at my local library so I took the leap.    And I am quite pleased I did. It was nice to not have hundreds of ancillary characters introduced. It was nice not have 75% of your main characters die and have to switch your focus to secondary plot lines. And above all else, it was nice to have people actually LOVE each other for once. Not one time the thousands of pages of Martin's epic did I ever, EVER, get the feel that two characters really loved one another (well, not true. Daenerys seems to love for a brief moment - and then her husband dies and we have a burning birth of dragons. Great.) All of the main characters in 'Song' are rich and privileged when everything starts. And, of course, they get knocked down throughout the story, but you always know in the back of your mind that they will probably reassert their bloodline someday. Merit? Hell, no. The fact that your dad was so-and-so? Plenty. Stories of common folk? Please.    I read a few of the bad reviews of this book and I have to lend them some credence. While Kvothe does seem to be uber-man, he's not Jaime Lannister. He's not Eddard Stark. He's not Jon Snow. In fact, the only person as interesting as Kvothe in 'Song' is Tyrion, and he was completely ignored in the 4th book. Does Kvothe have great combat skills? Does he wield a \\"magic\\" sword? No and no.     I will say this though, many of the ideas are derivative. There was a review that claimed Rothfuss stuck Kvothe in University for so long due to the success of the Harry Potter phenomenon. I can't argue that - but it didn't bother me. In fact, I'd go farther than that. The Chandrian are very reminiscent of both the Nazgul AND the Sith...Star Wars' evil side. Far from being a bad thing, I think that's fantastic! I want bad guys! I want good guys! In 'Song' you would be hard pressed to find who the \\"good\\" people are and, as a few have said before me, it seems any and all \\"good\\" people get rewarded with their own head handed to them.    But on top of all this, and what shines through for me, is the writing. Moments, thoughts, and feelings come through clear as day. And you begin to sympathize, empathize with the main character. Sure, he's smart as a whip. But he gets thrashed repeatedly and saves his hide just barely. Why people find some guy surviving a medieval battlefield swinging a magic sword while sheathed in armor and living more believable than Kvothe, I don't know. But those novels exist, and they're welcome to them.    Sure Kvothe is an archetype. So? He's Luke Skywalker with out the lightsaber; Ben Kenobi without the age. He's Harry Potter without the lineage. I love these stories and I do not mind having them told with a new hero. But I think the heart of it all is love story. NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE, in 'Song' would sacrifice \\"honor\\" for love. I relate to characters like myself - flawed, aspiring for perfection, and always susceptible to the maiden. Well done, Mr. Rothfuss, well done.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|To fully appreciate this movie, I think one needs to have a greater understanding of the kind of person Dali was.

Robert Pattinson pulled off this role beautifully and I could almost not imagine anyone else doing it so well. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|So, here we have Transatlantic in a whirlwind of a recording. CD 1 is simply stunning both musically and lyrically. I would advise anyone who is at all familiar with Prog Rock or Transatlantic to buy this on the strength of CD1 alone. It is awesome listening. It begs for another listen. More and more! The second CD of covers or other songs is hit and miss. The Genesis cover of Hogweed I thought could have been better considering who we are listening to. Hogweed gets a C+. I would actually give the whole of CD2 a C+. I just don't like covers normally. (Or at least I was led to think these are covers of previously covered songs). Yet, Transatlantic DOES NOT disappoint at all with the Whirlwind. It is just so exciting to listen to. It is oneof those pieces you can listen to again and again and hear different things each tme. Buy it!
1934030198|5.0|I'm the kind of guy who will sit down at Barnes and Noble for an hour and speed-read all of the books of a given category before buying, and I did the same for triathlon. This is by far the most comprehensive and well-put-together book in my opinion. As a serious collegiate triathlete, this book has all of the great details that will combine to give me a breakthrough in all 3 triathlon disciplines and a much smarter and structured training plan. Very well organized and not terribly dense. The beginning triathlete with little desire for top-3 age group finishes or better might find that it feels like a college textbook, but it hits all of the right subjects(and all race distances) at just the right depth for me. Worth every penny!

B000ICL3KG|1.0|This just goes to show, people will fall for anything.  The film was made, the lectures were given (for huge fees), and Al Gore feathered his nest egg by hundreds of millions of dollars, thanks for the most part to people not doing their research, checking those sources, just taking things at face value, or because someone said so.  Just like the old days, this elixir will cure lumbago, gout, and any of a hundred aliments.  Place a fancy package on it, and folks still eat it up... go figure.  I had long been suspect of the Academy Awards process and selections, as well as the Nobel, now I'm convinced, it's all a huge joke... and the joke is on you.  But ole Al is sure comfy in his multi-million dollar home on the coast, you know the one that was supposed to be destroyed by rising oceans.. remember?.

B001RCD2DW|4.0|Suppose there were a device that could enhance your sense of taste.  You're familiar with the taste of bacon -- this bacon is good, that bacon is (of course) also good but not as good as the other bacon.  Okay, but now you have the capacity to separate the sensations of saltiness, oil, meaty, smokey, etc, in fine detail.  You can focus on them individually: Wow, I can detect a note of fennel in there.  Fennel?  How does fennel interact with smokiness?  In fact, what does bacon as a whole really taste like?    That's analogous to the challenge these headphones have brought to me.  Giving me the ability to isolate each little element of music is at first distracting to the point that it's hard to hear the music as a whole.  Folks speak of the huge \\"soundstage\\" of these phones, and I guess this is what they mean.  The discrete components of the music all originate from different points in space, and you can direct your attention at them, as though \\"looking\\" at different parts of the music.  I've found that, ironically, I have to resist this temptation, when I want to try to hear the music as a whole.  And I do find that I can hear it in wonderful detail.  Sure, like everyone says, you will hear things in the music you never heard before.  That's not some vague gesture, you really will hear specific things in the music that you never heard before.    Okay, but maybe this is par for the course with any reasonably decent headphones.  What about the quality of the sound in general?  Is the base lacking?  In fact, no, it's not.  Like \\"Left Side Drive\\", from the Trans Canada Highway album by Boards of Canada, which has this deep, very low frequency component that is a vital part of the shimmering lonely place that that song evokes -- it's there in all its glory.  Too much treble?  Well, a snare drum can come out a little over-represented.  Some have described the sound of these phones as \\"clinical\\".  I guess I can imagine what they mean.  But even something as earthy as TomWaits' Swordfishtrombones feels like it retains its earthiness.  I mean, if you wanted it to be muddied into a single swampy gumbo of sound, maybe you shouldn't have put on some really nice headphones?    As far as comfort is concerned, these are slightly on the loose side, for me, but not floppy.  Very comfortable.  Y'all must have big heads, if these seem tight to you.  Clearly, I've got very compact and efficient brains.    Looking forward someday to trying another set of quality phones, for comparison.
B000002W3R|5.0|I reviewed this album several years ago but in light of the recent death of Michael Jackson and the overblown hysteria surrounding his death and the<br />endless accolades as to his \\"greatness\\",  I felt it necessary to remind those who might have just recently jumped on board as an Elvis fan that no one, not even Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra, matched the versatility of Elvis Presley.  Elvis sang the blues better than anyone.  He sang Country better than anyone.  He crooned as good as Crosby and he Rock'd and Rolled better than anyone.  This album, ELVIS, MOODY BLUE, incorporates two albums previously released but now in one CD.  It is Elvis at his vocal and emotional best, despite his failing health.  The recordings were made at Graceland as Elvis, for whatever reason, did not want to go to RCA's recording studio.  The principal vocals and combo backups were done at Graceland and the orchestral and choir  backups were added later at the studio.  Almost every tune is contemplative, melancholy and more than likely a mea culpa for time lost and frittered away on temporal pleasures.  It is Elvis with more heart and soul than any of his many other recordings, the most outstanding cuts of which are HE'LL HAVE TO GO, PLEDGING MY LOVE, SHE THINKS I STILL CARE, IT'S EASY FOR YOU, HURT, NEVER AGAIN, THE BITTER THEY ARE THE HARDER THEY FALL and the last three cuts which sum up a broken man's final confession, SOLITAIRE, LOVE COMING DOWN and I'LL NEVER FALL IN LOVE AGAIN.  His voice is strong, full and in remarkable control for a man on many drugs and medications.  On this basis alone I give it five stars.<br /><br />As for the comparisons to Jackson I think it is really silly.  Jackson did not have universal appeal in any way, shape or form as did Elvis.  His music is far from universally sung or even revered by the general public as is Elvis'.  His personality and persona was a complete antithesis of Elvis.  Elvis' TV specials, record sales, feature films, concert attendancesand memorabilia will never be matched by anyone and his Graceland is the second most popular and visited attraction in the country.  Lastly, Elvis was an Army veteran, totally patriotic and a national treasure.  Jackson's life and past is well documented as abnormal and dark.

1576754499|5.0|In Out of Poverty, Paul Polak communicates a clear and sustainable vision on how to lift the world's poorest out of poverty and describes example after example of real world solutions.     Personally I am deeply inspired and motivated by Out of Poverty to get involved and make a difference. Previously I have only been exposed to the handout version of how to help the poor - a model I have never been fond of since it's a never ending cycle.    Paul's book dispels that notion and instead provides a roadmap for helping the world's poorest people multiply their income.    This is a must read for anyone involved in charity work of any kind with lessons to be learned from that can be applied anywhere.
1594488916|2.0|Ms. Bartlett's capable hand reveals a narcissistic crumb's romp using pilfered credit cards.  Early on it is revealed that mr. gilkey loves lots of things-a catcher's mitt, fine dinners, expensive travel, and gambling (all at the cost of others.)  He evokes no empathy and even less admiration.  Sometimes, Ms. Barlett, a thief is just a thief.
B000077VPU|4.0|I have this video and is Ok but I think is time to a Blu Ray version with<br />the whole concert, I mean THE WHOLE CONCERT with Extreme, Metallica and<br />others playing at the beggining of this historical event, in the way like the VHS<br />version was made.
B000002504|5.0|Ewwww!  Gross!  A giant octopus on the album cover!  They are such slimy and icky creatures.       I've always wondered if the octopus comes from the same family as the jellyfish and squids.  I believe they do.  Speaking of which, you do NOT want to get stung by a jellyfish.  Talk about a painful ordeal (though I hear vinegar works and makes the pain from the sting go away immediately- you might wanna try that next time you're clamming in the bay during the scorching humid months of July and August).     Anyway, ignore the album cover, haha.  It doesn't even matter whether your version shows the giant painting of an orange octopus, or the green octopus swimming around inside a jar (waiting to be dissected by the looks of things- just give me a zero on THAT assignment 'cuz I ain't doin' it!).  I'd rather let my nerdy science geek partner do it for me. :)     Octopus is Gentle Giant's most popular album... I think.  I've honestly been waiting a long time for an answer to that one.  It seems like In a Glass House has gained some considerable ground in the popularity department as of late, so who knows.       One thing's for sure, and I know this for an absolute fact-  Octopus kicks mean butt (with tentacles).  The entire 35-minute journey blows my mind.  People want you to think the band is attempting a commercial direction here, but you and I both know better than to believe such hogwash.  There's absolutely nothing remotely commercial about these guys.  If this band is suitable for radio listeners, then well... I have female body parts and never realized it until this very moment.  :)     My favorite song is probably \\"River\\".  Wanna know why?  The instrumental break in the middle actually reminds me of a river.  No, not the kind of river you see in cartoons where the boat flips over and the characters freak out as the water current picks up and a giant waterfall can be seen directly ahead.  \\"Quick, grab ahold of this nearby log that ALWAYS happens to be in the rightplace at the right time!  You'll make it!\\"  Or another possible scenario.  \\"Grab ahold of my hand!\\"  Yeah, like a hand will be able to reach out far enough to grab a person flowing down a river at amazing speeds.  Give me a break.     No, this is more like a river that just keeps flowing and flowing.  Flowing peacefully.  No end in sight.  It's awesome.  The guitar solo rocks so hard it makes the members of Abba stand up and go  \\"That's what WE should have done, d'oh!\\"       The vocal melody is really weird too.  It sounds like the lead singer is intentionally going for an awkward way of singing it.  He almost sings like a zombie who's been wandering around the streets for so many days now that he's completely exhausted and has no desire to infect you.   It's unbelievably strange... but ultimately fascinating!       I highly doubt the lead singer would be able to recreate THAT exact vocal melody during a live performance.  But let me guess- he'll prove me wrong just like everyone else eventually does.  Everyone just HAS to get their point across and rub my face in the mud, don't they?  \\"Touuuuuuch the last, of whaaaaaat has past!\\"  Such a weird way to sing that line.       I need to be completely serious for a moment.  About six hours before the 9/11 incident took place back in 2001, I stayed up all night long listening to Deep Purple, Dave Mason, and yes, Gentle Giant.  The one song I was listening to at the time was \\"A Cry for Everyone\\".       Now unfortunately, whenever I hear the song, I think about what took place that horrible morning (just a few hours later).  It has permanently left a lasting impression in my mind about death and war, and even though I obviously enjoy the song, I simply don't listen to it anymore because those feelings have NOT faded away (nor *will* they ever go away- not when thousands of people died just a few short hours later).       Anyway, let me get back to being my typically goofy self, since that's what I'm most good at!    I don'tmean to brag, but I have made an imaginary career out of it, ya know. :)    \\"The Advent of Panurge\\" (what in the WORLD?) is a pretty adventurous song.  Yeah, adventurous.  Something just about EVERY Gentle Giant song is, hehe.  It has a vocal melody so calm and rational it reminds me of... knitting on the front porch with my grandmom.  Oh man, that's no good!  I'm a grown man and should have moved on from grandmother's house but... those homemade cookies and that fresh zucchini bread keep on bringin' me back.  Darn it.  She got me firmly under her hold.     Anyway, \\"The Advent of Panurge\\" is incredibly melodic and soothing.  It takes my mind away from my otherwise daily routine of anxiety problems and other personal issues, so let's put on a big smile for grandmom today and joyfully move on to the next featured song.   Before we do, let's sing some highly melodic lines from it.  \\"Look at my friend, look around my friend!\\"  I don't have any friends, hehe.  Don't believe me?  Just read my review for Three Friends.       I just love this song so much I can't stop singing the many different vocal melodies.  There, I said it.  It's addicting!  \\"Please take me home, I'll stay with you\\" is another great line.  So warm.  You won't ever see people singing such a heart-warming melody while waiting in line at Walmart, that's for sure.  There's other fascinating aspects of this song that are just... too incredibly unusual to put into any kind of words that make a lick of sense.       Anyway, I'm starting to ramble more than usual, haha.  Sorry about that.  Let's move on (for REAL this time).      Listen to \\"Knots\\".  Listen carefully.  Notice a trend developing here?  This album places a LOT of emphasis on vocal melodies above everything else.  Any instrumental portions are almost always shorter and weirder than usual, but never last for an extended period of time (except for the one in \\"River\\", I guess).  I like when the lead singer screams \\"So you will HAAAAAAVE TO TELL ME ALLLLLL!\\"  I THINK that's what he's saying.  Can't really understand a gosh darn thing, you see.   For all I know, there's actually three different people singing it.  Gentle Giant is all about expressing weirdness and creativity in all its gory glory.        Let me just be completely honest here- the vocals in this particular track prove without a shadow of a doubt that Gentle Giant are geniuses.  'Nuff said.    The next song is called... \\"Raconteur Troubadour\\".  Whatever THAT means.  I'm definitely not a fan of the vocal melody here, I'm afraid.  Even the best experimental bands miss a bus every now and then.  This happens to be that bus.  Some of the exquisite instrumental chops are dazzling though.  Those chops save it.   I guess.  By sounding really traditional and old fashioned.   By cuddling up to a warm book with your high school sweetheart wife on a cold Texas night.  By making sure the horses are in their stable and away from alien activity.  Yeah, you get the point.       You'd probably expect a song with the title \\"The Boys In the Band\\" to be the party anthem of the ages, correct?  Well, I GUESS it is... in Gentle Giant's mad little devious world of continuous experimentation, that is!  I officially declare *this* the craziest song on the entire album.     There's a sappy ballad on here, but it's nothing compared to the Beatles-influenced \\"Dog's Life\\".  This song would seriously fit in perfectly on their Revolver album.  Talk about brilliant beyond words.  This song contains a melody that most certainly does NOT remind me of dogs, haha.  More like cats.  I love it all the same.     A great album.  I'm out.
B000YI7MRM|4.0|Unlike a previous reviewer, I found this movie well worth the wait.  It had a good story line and was well shot and well acted.  I wouldn't consider this a epic tale but is but it is an entertaining action film that was supprisingly accurate historically.  I consider the caracter developement to be quite good even though I don't speak Spanish.  Overall, a very enjoyable production.
B002ZG97RY|2.0|Green Zone is about the search for non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq after the fall of the Hussein regime. Director Greengrass and Damon make the pace as frenetic as it was in Bourne three.  They succeed with the pace, but the story just isn't there.  The best thing about Green Zone is that maybe Damon will realize he should have gone ahead with Bourne Four.  I bought the Blu-Ray version with the digital copy.  I like the idea of the digital copy so I can watch movies on my computer while other family members use the T-V set and/or its DVD player.  This is not the worst film ever made, not even the worst Damon film, but it's not in his top ten either.  Only for real Damon or Iraq war film [[ASIN:B002ZG97RE Green Zone]]  fans.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|This was a great movie!  Almost non-stop action--car chases, run from the CIA, lots of shooting and fighting, and a few twists and turns.<br /><br />Evelyn Salt is a CIA intelligence officer.  She is married to a German National who has easy access to move freely, in and out of Korea.  She is about to go home to celebrate her wedding anniversary when a Russian defector shows up at the office, telling a story.  He says he is dying of cancer and has nothing to lose.  He explains that many years ago, the Russians developed a plot to ruin America, the \\"KA\\" program (\\"kill America\\", I guess).  They trained many, many children and then substituted them into American life as \\"sleepers\\", to participate in a well-orchestrated plot at a much later time.  When the time is right, these children would be activated.  The one assigned to kill the Russian president was Evelyn Salt!<br /><br />As Evelyn is interrogating the defector, the other agents are running a body scan on him which indicates he is telling the truth.  Uh oh.  They begin to look at Evelyn a little differently.  Meanwhile, she is concerned about her husband's safety and takes off to find him.  This begins Evelyn's chase and a ton of action.<br /><br />Is \\"our\\" Evelyn Salt really Agent Chenkov?  Or is someone setting her up?  Watch and see.  I think you will really enjoy this movie if you like action.<br /><br />BTW--Yes, there is a lot of BS in the chase scenes, where Evelyn would likely have been killed in real life many times over, BUT, that's what makes a movie fun!  They get up and keep on going--they are the ONE person in the whole world who could survive or could achieve something.  Get real--that's what you go to see--the so-called impossible stuff! Angelina does a great job in this high-action flick!
B000127LW2|5.0|I received excellent response to my order.  The product Star Trek Voyager - The Compoete First  Season arrived in perfect condition and the DVDs were perfectly recorded.  I will definitely order more but only through Amazon directly and not through outside vendors as I have not had good luck with them.
B003LL3NOK|3.0|First off, I am a huge Romero fan, which why this is painful to write.  To get to the point this movie really didn't have the pop all the other movies do.  The civil war between the families and the decisions on whether the living dead have any humanity left, has kind of been done over and over ie, an issue of \\"the walking dead\\" comic books dealt with this same thing and did it a lot better.  After an hour of watching this it didn't really feel like it was taking me anywhere or really doing anything.  Also it feels like things like Ipods and things were just jammed in to give this move a sense of zeitgeist.  In the end you really don't care about the characters and kind of start rooting for the zombies(if you don't all ready do that).  I only gave this movie three stars because Romero did it, if this would have been a less respected director or any other director I would have given it a one or two.  Also the \\"living dead\\" movies have always kind of had a bit of camp to them but this was taken to a whole new level, it just kind of seemed like the actors were riffing but were way out of tune.  Hopefully this is just a bump in the road and the next one will get back on track.  But if you enjoyed this movie, good for you, I just don't think it fits with the rest of his canon.
0316069906|5.0|How the factory farming of animal persists is astounding.  This great book lays it all out, logically and accurately.  It makes it easy to never want to eat animal flesh again.  I stopped and could not chew it or get it down anymore - it is just revolting if not dangerous.  Perhaps it is a conspiracy to get us all sick so someone can make money on all sides of the animal protein industry!
B000VWOV3O|3.0|I have been looking for Mahavishnu since I recently listened to Birds Of Fire, and I decided to get the original album classic collection. I did expect more as far as liner notes and pictures are concerned,but, I guess that you cant always get what you want. I was very impressed of the sound of the CDs, even though Apocalypse is too mellow for my tastes. I have to say that Inner Mounting Flame is my favorite, followed by Birds of Fire (the song \\"One Word\\" sums up what Mahavishnu is all about), Visions Of The Emerald Beyond, Between Nothingness and Eternity,and Apocalypse. The Nothingness version of \\"Dream\\" is way too long, the version on the Trident sessions is the one to have.
1933784032|1.0|I too, own many of the various other books detailing the creation of the Star Wars universe.  Like them, this one tells a small part of the story.  While some material has been seen before, I don't mind at all seeing it again along side Lorne's insightful commentary.    HOWEVER, as another reviewer mentioned, the binding leaves much to be desired.  My copy started to disintegrate as soon as I opened it.  A shame, as I would rate the book 5 stars if it had an intact spine.  As such, it hardly gets looked at now as every turn of the page could be the last thanks to the inferior binding.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|One of my daughter's favorite movies and it is pretty entertaining for adults.  Highly recommend.
0307463745|4.0|This book was recommended to me. It took me only 2 days to read and was such an easy read which is good for me because it's quite difficult to keep my attention.    It has great case examples, the chapters are super short and to the point and gives some great advice. A lot of the lessons really made me think of the way I see things.    The only thing is that these lessons work if you are in a very small company or a start-up, but probably wouldn't apply for large companies.    Anyway, it's worth a read and I def. recommend it (especially for small startups)
B002KREVCO|5.0|If there are any younger fans out there that wish to see and hear AC/DC in their prime then this is an amazing opportunity.  Video's from the days of Bon Scott and the early days of Brian Johnson are in this great product.  Also you get live recording from AC/DC in the seventies and into the early eighties.  As if that were not enough there are also rare studio recordings of songs such as \\"Cold-Hearted Man\\", \\"Borrowed Time\\", and \\"Cyberspace\\".  I was amazed at an early Bon Scott recording of a song simply titled \\"Love Song\\".  A love song from AC/DC?  You got to be kidding.  This collection is a must for any fans of AC/DC.  It would be cheap at twice the price.
B001P22HK8|4.0|An entertaining and thrilling read. The gaming and hacking references strike a nice balance for those who wouldn't know much about those topics. The characters are simple but a few have just enough to them to keep you interested. The pacing is very quick and the scenarios presented are mostly plausible. Towards the very end it gets to be a bit silly, over the top, and I guess very Hollywood. That would be my only gripe in an otherwise very enjoyable read and it's not a big one. If you're a fan of thrillers, videogames, and/or computers I would highly recommended it.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|The raw emotions that you will feel after watching this film make it worth the price tag. Even if you are not a fan of the series this dark and complex story will leave you wanting more. I am not going to spoil the story like some of these reviewers did. Just buy it.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Now this is what I'm talking about. Phillip Noyce's \\"Salt\\" is my type of summer movie. First and foremost \\"Salt\\" is an action film and it succeeds with flying colors in that regard. But what I really admired about this picture is that it took place in reality. The action was grounded in physics and therefore made it messy, mean and hard hitting. Then we have bon-a-fied movie superstar Angelina Jolie in her best action performance. Where \\"Salt\\" also succeeds stupendously is with Evelyn Salt's characterization, which is complex, dualistic, fascinating and ultimately enigmatic. Jolie thrives in this role which plays to literally every one of her strengths as an actress. You root for her and sympathize with her even though it's never clear what side Evelyn truly falls into. It's in this intense dynamic between plot, character and action that leaves \\"Salt\\" head and shoulders over films like \\"Eclipse\\", \\"Clash of the Titans\\", \\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\" and yes, even \\"Inception\\". But also on a side note it's just plain refreshing to see a film that has Russians trying to take down America, crisp and clean action cinematography and a true movie star like Jolie leading things along. This is classic summer filmmaking at it's finest.
0679736646|5.0|To be read by anyone who has questioned there own reality and seen it as being unreal as a dream. Death scenes in the book bring reminders of the Tibetan Bardo Teachings. Recommended Reading for all!!

0618001905|5.0|\\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" is a brilliant piece of historical non-fiction.  The narrative examines the brutal colonization and exploitation of a huge swath of Africa in the late 19th Century under the wicked direction of King Leopold II of Belgium.  Millions are slaughtered in the name of King Leopold and based on the outrageous belief that Africans were lesser people, closer to animals.  Along the way, the book touches on the issues of race, greed, human rights, international politics and what it takes to call out the truth about any government and its actions. \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" will pull you along. The narrative is straightforward and the accounts are riveting. In spots, they are even hard to digest, such as when seven-year-old African boys are whipped for laughing in the presence of a white man.  \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" plays out on a global landscape and demonstrates (how many examples do we need?) how a government can dominate when it controls the story and manipulates impressions through the media.<br /><br />\\"Belgium's lack of great-power status meant that Leopold was dependent on cunning, above all on his skill at manipulating the press. As he waged his countercampaign, the king showed himself to be as much a master of the media as his archenemy Morel.\\"  (Morel is Edmund Dene Morel, a shipping-business worker turned journalist who mounts a relentless campaign of news stories about what's really happening in Africa.)  Travel writers are dispatched and their costs are picked up in order to best showcase the \\"territory's delights.\\"  I can't think of a better example of the word \\"junket.\\" Hostages are released before the travel writer lands in each town and prisons leveled, too.  Reporters from English and German newspapers are bribed. \\"Readers observed similar mysterious transformations in other German newspapers,\\" writes Hochschild.

B0019UGYK0|5.0|\\"Cool Hand Luke\\" is a classic movie and I remember being very impressed with it in the first run in the late 60s. Paul Newman portrays a slacker/rebel/antiestablishment/nonconformist young man who's going to do things his own way no matter what the consequences. We've all known young people like him. Of course, he runs into problems with the law and gets thrown into the slammer for vandalism. That's only the beginning of a long and complicated downhill run.<br /><br />It's a rather depressing movie with a couple very funny and uplifting parts that are so good it makes watching the whole movie very worthwhile. One is the spot when the working prison gang passes by a scantly clad young lady washing a car and doing everything possible to attract the attention of the workers. Funny? Just amazing! A second very funny scene is where Luke claims that he can eat 50 eggs and then carries out the boast in an increasingly agonizing fashion. These two scenes save what might have been a rather dreary movie and turn it into a classic.<br /><br />The sound and photography are excellent. Paul Newman is outstanding and George Kennedy is the best I've ever seen him in any roll. It's an excellent, if somewhat depressing story and makes for wonderful entertainment.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I hope ABC will restart a second chance for this show if it sells good in other countrys.
B003I6473E|4.0|After listening to Bionic for nearly 2 weeks, I'm loving it more and more. It's not as personal or confessional as Stripped or grown up as Back To Basics, but it's the first time Christina truly lets her hair down and has fun. There's no pretentious intro proclaiming how \\"real\\" she is or how there will never be another like her.<br /><br />The steely, sing speak of the title track lets you know that Christina's willing to try something different. \\"Bionic, take it supersonic, eh/I'm bionic; hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh/Bionic, so damn bionic, eh/Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh!\\" I was ambivelant towards Not Myself Tonight when I first heard it. I still don't think it was the best choice for the first single, but I really like it now. It has just enough of an electropop synth-heavy production without taking it overboard. \\"In the morning/When I wake up/I'll go back to the girl I used to be/But baby/Not toniiiiiight!\\"<br /><br />I laughed my butt off when I read the lyrics for Woohoo. Thank goodness the song is intentionally tongue-in-cheek and playfully crass. \\"All the boys think its cake when they taste my (woohoo)/You dont even need a plate, just your face, Ha!/Licky-licky yum-yum what a great guy!\\" I'm not that familiar with Nicki Minaj, but her kooky rap complete with a Jamacian patois adds to the track's quirkiness. I love how Christina's vocals (a cross between Gwen Stefani and Nelly Furtado) get stretched on the rubbery Elastic Love and she gives props to Madonna on the Vogue inspired Glam. \\"Don't let the clothes wear you.\\"<br /><br />Desnudate is a sexy, Latin flavored club track that demands the listener to \\"Get naked for me\\" and Christina's Spanish lyrics spice it up. \\"Oh, quitate/Oh, la ropa/Oh, librase/Oh, ahora!\\" I have to be in a certain mood to listen to Prima Donna though. Christina gets her growl on and that's fine, but the music sounds a bit too heavy for me. The Lil' Jon sounding background shouts (I think it's really him, but I could be wrong) aren't necesarry imo.<br /><br />The ethereal Morning Dessert interlude flows seamlessly into the early morning slow jam Sex For Breakfast. Much like Loving Me 4 Me on Stripped, Christina restrains her often bombastic powerhouse vocals to a light and airy tone. The baby makin' styled lyrics (\\"Strawberry cream is like a dream, my fantasy is reality/When the morning comes, I know that I will too\\") recall Janet Jackson. I wouldn't exactly put it in the same league of That's the Way Love Goes or Any Time, Any Place, but it's so much better than, say, Warmth.<br /><br />Linda Perry comes on board for the after the storm ballad Lift Me Up. Some critics have blasted it for coming off as a copycat to Beautiful, but I don't see the resemblance. Lift Me Up isn't as lyrically powerful as it's predecessor, but the production is buoyed by Christina's gorgeously pure vocals. The cute My Heart interlude features a sweet moment between Christina's hubby Jordan and their little boy Max. \\"Show me how you sing like mommy!\\" Then follows All I Need, a heartfelt ode to how her son has changed and brightened her life. \\"You bring me hope when I can't breathe/You give me love, you're all I need/Slowly I'm holding you closely/So happy to carry you inside me.\\" Christina takes on a relaxed Alanis-like vocal tone on the orchestral I Am. Some of the lyrics put me in the mind of Hand In My Pocket. \\"I am timid and/I am oversensitive/I am a lioness/I am tired and defensive.\\"<br /><br />The real jaw dropper of the entire record is the haunting ballad You Lost Me. Reminiscent of Fiona Apple and Sade, The lyrics beautifully convey the agony of discovering the infidelity of a lover. \\"I am done, smoking gun/We've lost it all, the love is gone/She has won, now it's no fun/We've lost it all, the love is gone\\" and \\"I feel like our world's been infected/And somehow you left me neglected/We've found our lives been changed/Babe, you lost me.\\" Christina's voice gains momentum as the songreaches it peak and bursts with passion and despair, but she never once oversings. After all this time, she finally understands that you don't have to squeeze the life out of every note or oversell a song to convey emotion. The ghostly, operatic background vocals are genius!<br /><br />Now that the sad songs are over, let's party! The Gwen Stefani/Pink pop of I Hate Boys is slightly immature for someone Christina's age with a chorus like \\"I hate boys, but boys love me/I think they suck and my friends agree\\", but it's supposed to be bratty with the tongue stuck out as far as possible. Have fun with it and \\"if you hate em boys, shake it!\\" The Peaches assisted disco laced My Girls is even better. \\"My girls wear lipstick while they're making my beats/They got guitar picks in their purses, Louboutins on their feet/They got no time for waiting in lines/They got sex and 808s running through their dirty minds.\\" It's no secret that Xtina possesses a pretty large ego. A quick read of the lyrics for Vanity would understandably make you roll your eyes out of your head, but a listen to the song shows the jokes on you. The self-absorption is so over the top that you can't help but love it. \\"V is for vanity, every time I look at me/I turn myself on, yeah\\" and \\"V is for vanity, thank you mom and daddy!\\" The last bit with her kid adds a nice touch. \\"Let us not forget/Who owns the throne?\\" \\"You do mommy!\\"<br /><br />Bionic might take a handful of listens in order to grab your attention, but it's hard not to admire Christina's newfound sense of humor. Her attitude toward her voice has improved as well. Rather than feeling like she has to prove how talented she is and how many notes she can hit, she allows herself to change things up. As for the clean version of the record, I still wouldn't recommend playing it around the kids. Songs like Lift Me Up, All I Need, and You Lost Me are fine, but who wants their kid in the room while (for example) Sex For Breakfast is playing? Or Woohoo? While keeping that in mind, give Bionic a try and enjoy!nd despair, but she never once oversings.

B001HN694K|3.0|In my opinion this movie is not for children. It's too scary. I would rather children watch an earlier version. I'm a fan of Johnny Depp and it shows his versitality as an actor but not my favorite role for him. I loved him in the Pirate movies and other movies but not this  one. Think twice before getting this one.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|If I could only pick one alubm to have for the rest of my life, it'd be this one. It's amazing. I'm glad that the Beatles and George Martin left it like this and didn't change anything. It's perfect as is. It starts with the title track (a great rocker)and then blends into,maybe, the most famous anthem of friendship (\\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\"). Next is \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" which is said to be about a picture paited by a 4 year-old Julian Lennon. Many people also rumor that it's about LSD. I don't know which is true, but it's still a great song. \\"Getting Better\\" is a funny one, thanks to John's sarcastic back up vocals. \\"Fixing a Hole\\" is whimsical. \\"She's Leaving Home\\" has a poor string arrangment, but it amoung the Beatles's best work thanks to some of the best, sad Lennon/McCartney lyrics ever. \\"Mr. Kite\\" is sort of a spooky song, but is also a fun one. \\"Within You, Without You\\" is probably the weakest track here. I still like it,however, because of it's lyrics. It sounds really great when it is blended in with Lennon's \\"Tommorrow Never Knows\\" on the Love soundtrack. \\"I'm I'm Sixty-Four\\" is just a pleasant love diddy with a music hall sound. I love that song. \\"Lovely Rita\\" is one of Paul's best rhyming songs (next to Maxwell's Silver Hammer). It also has great music. \\"Good Morning,\\" is the most sarcastic track by the Beatles, which has John poking fun at average English life. There is then a brief reprise of the title track and then the strongest song on the album, and almost the strongest song by the Beatles (next to \\"In My Life\\"). \\"A Day In The Life\\" has great music, lonley vocals, and spine-tingling lyrics. It's the grandest finale. Ever.    Many people say that this one goes to Paul. Although, Paul did the majority of the writing, I really think him and John were working hard together for this. But, it's not so much the songs that make this album great. It's how well the songs go together. So, I think this one goes to George Martin.   Theonly way this album could be improved is if they had included the singles \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" on it. That's the best double A-side single ever. This is a fantastic album.
0553808001|5.0|I have to admit that I love Ted Nasmith's work, so was predisposed to like this calendar. For the most part, he rendered the castles wonderfully. Even when I disagree with his take on them, they are still wonderful pieces. Of the 13 castles, 10 are perfect. The renderings of Winterfell, Highgarden, The Red Keep, Riverun, The Eyrie, and Sunspear  are particularly fine. One, Casterly Rock, is a very imaginative rendering that, while not being what I had pictured, was so well done that it convinced me. Only 2, Harrenhal and Storms End, were \\"wrong,\\" and even then, they were beautifully done. In Short, for G. R. R. Martin and fantasy artwork fans, this calendar is well worth it!

0446563048|4.0|This story is one of success and persistence. It is the story of the company Zappos. The book is a chronicle of the history of the company from the inception to being bought by Amazon. The author's parents came from Taiwan to the U. S. to attend college. The family moved to California, where the author was raised. He later went to Harvard, became active on the internet, and started working at Oracle with a friend Sanjay. He began to get ideas for developing his own business ideas and left Oracle to pursue his own career. His money or the business was received from Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital, and began to develop the concept of Zappos. The word Zapatos is the Spanish word for shoes, and Zappos is a derivation of the word. Zappos' mission was to make buying shoes less of an ordeal, and more of a pleasure.     The author explains the steps that he took to initiate the company and add life to the Zappos start up. He describes everything from his first shoe conference and show, his ideas for marketing and branding his product, and the keys to his current success.    His advice on helping others find and achieve success are full of incite and spot on. The reader  will gain a deeper understanding of what it takes to be successful, and how to take a small idea creatively to the next level of ultimate success.

I'm not a big fan of science fiction due to my own failure of imagination.  The further away from reality as I know it, the harder it is for me to get involved in and follow a story.<br /><br />Bacigalupi's much-lauded and honored debut is set in our world--in Thailand, a few hundred years in the future.  But it's a much-changed world.  Specifically, it's a post-petroleum world.  I started this review with a definition of the word \\"calorie.\\"  In this weight-obsessed time, people have forgotten that a calorie is actually a measure of energy.  That point isn't commented upon in the text, but it seems relevant as much of the novel revolves around the Kingdom of Thailand's need to feed its people and power its nation and economy.<br /><br />It seems a variety of plagues have beset the agricultural world.  Some may have been natural, some engineered, and surely climate change has taken its toll.

It is an intriguing exploration of a post-petroleum society with regard to the science, industry, and politics of the time.

B002B55XGI|1.0|I rarely walk out of a movie but I have a done it a few times. I practically always finish a book once I have started reading it because I usually research it enough to know that the content interests me. I made it through the first 35 pages of  \\"Lone Survivor\\" and it was some of the most painful reading I have ever done. All my life I have been fascinated by the military, in particular Special Forces. I have read a vast amount of military history and fiction, including Tom Clancy's and Patrick Robinson's works. I recently read Robert's Ridge and very much appreciated it. I really thought that \\"Lone Survivor\\" would be exactly what I was looking for. I have deep respect for the discipline, strength, the exceptional stamina, devotion and professionalism of members of special forces teams of all countries who employ them. And while I understand that Special Forces see themselves as just that, special, the way Luttrell goes on about the high standards of conduct of his \\"special breed of warriors\\", the superhuman qualities and essential flawlessness of his brothers in arms is just not credible. Maybe as a Texan this type of absurdly uncritical attitude of \\"We are the best\\" has been implanted in him from early on but for a person of at least high school education level with some trace of critical thinking, despite all the patriotism one may feel, reading this book is almost physically painful. Some passages are an indication of the author's blatant ignorance and his obvious subscription to G.W. Bush's misguided religious approach to the Irag and Afghanistan wars. I know that as a SEAL you have to be uncommonly strong, have uncommon will power and be uncommonly smart. What Luttrell proves is that you don't necessarily have to be uncommonly intelligent or educated to become a SEAL - he became one, after all. The passage \\"an insurgent fighting for some different god from our own, a god who somehow sanctioned murder of innocent civilians, a god who'd effectively booted the Ten Commandments over the touchline and out of play\\" is interesting. Does Luttrell portray a god as viewed by the insurgent or is this is own view of Islam? Here Luttrell becomes the worst kind of the \\"American tourist\\"-stereotype: uneducated and armed! At some point, Luttrell tries to give his very limited ten cents about the \\"Did Saddam have WMD?\\"-question. He goes way out of his league there, even trying to give a \\"Luttrell's quick guide to basic  physics of the nuclear bomb\\" at some point. He seems to try to tell the reader from his isolated \\"I have been there on the ground, I know better than anyone else, you cannot argue with me\\" viewpoint that he has clear evidence of WMD (D for Destruction that is, not Disappearance) in Iraq and that there was evidence that Al Queda and Saddam were connected before Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld launched their large business adventure - the Iraq War. This is where the book turned from just very poor, immature writing style to just plain uneducated/unresearhed. It could have been written by George W. Bush himself. Bush used to (attempt to) talk in catch phrases senselessly lined up without connection. Were it not for the fact that even the Bush administration has in the meantime conceded that there is no proof of Iraqi WMDs and no connection between Saddam and Al Queda before it created one by embarking on a war backed only by Poland, Britain and the Kingdom of Tonga.<br />I think that Luttrell does the SEALs a disservice by having written this book.

0691142165|5.0|If you are an investor, you need to read this book: \\"This Time is Different\\"     The authors went through and captured data from around the world for the last 800 years to demonstrate that while financial crises are not identical, they do rhyme and have patterns that are recognizable.  As someone with money on the sidelines because of all the shenanigans in the stock market (15 seconds front running, trade and cancel order in 65 microseconds), I am interested in how I should invest for my kids and retirement (if at all).    The portions of the book that stood out are:    (a) whenever banking crisis and housing bubble go hand in hand (\\"the twins\\") they tend to be very destructive as opposed to a pure stock bubble (e.g., internet bubble).  See Table 10.8 at this [...]    On average, these crises last 3-6 years except for Japan, which is still ongoing for 19 years.   Equity price collapses on average 56% over a duration of 3.5 years.  Unemployment is usually deep and prolonged, increasing by 7% over a four year period.  Output drops on average 9% over an average of 2 years.       (b) when the twins are synchronized, a sovereign debt crisis usually follows the twins.  The typical sovereign debt crisis has the government exploding its debt by 86% either to bail out the bankers or to pump stimulus into the economy.     You may remember that we had the banking and housing crash in 2008.  In 2010, we are now seeing signs of a sovereign debt crisis so (a) and (b) are right on schedule ... for other countries at least.  But (b) has not occurred in the US at least because (1) the dollar is the reserve currency (i.e., the Windows XP in a world without Apple Mac); (2) the dollar is backed by 6000 nuclear warheads; and (3) backed by 700+ military bases around the world.  On the other hand, the US is borrowing as much money as all of the countries combined in 2010 alone.  At some point, someone is going to yell \\"fire\\" and then we will have a full on sovereign crisis.   For now, though, everyone is yelling fire in the Greek theater, Spanish theater, Irish theater, Portugal theater and so on so we're safe .... for now.    The US' response to the crisis in 2008 was to do what Japan did and more.  So don't expect this crisis to end in 3-7 years but may be much longer.  This may be the first job-LOSS recovery because of the overcapacity of (1) labor in China and India; (2) manufacturing; and (3) housing.  For an example, look to Japan where Japanese are outsourcing themselves into lower wage countries:  [...]    The authors end with the following empirical model for the crises in (a) and (b):  Step 1 - financial liberalization.  Any one with a breath can get a loan. NINJA loans (No-Income-No-Job-or-Asset)  Step 2 - stock and real estate market crashes.  Iceland in 2008.  Step 3 -  currency crash.  This happened to Iceland in 2008.  Step 4 - inflation picks up.  Again Iceland in 2010. This has not happened yet in the US because the amount of debt $100Trillion is backed by only $1Trillion in physical dollar, hence deflation.  Step 5 - peak of banking crisis - if there is no default of the banking system.  The 6 US banks are too big to fail so this won't happen.  Step 6 - default on external debt or domestic debt.  Step 7 - inflation worsens, running 40%+ if step 6 occur.    Personally, I believe that the financial, insurance, and real estate (the \\"FIRE sector\\") has metasized into a virulent form of cancer.  This cancer, thanks to supercomputers and derivatives, will modify the above model as follows:    Step 1 - financial liberalization.   Step 2 - stock and real estate market crashes.  STEP 3A - DEFLATION allowing bankers to buy up assets such as water purification plants, power plants, toll roads that our \\"betters\\" whom we have elected had loaded down with debts and derivatives.  Step 4A - inflation picks up for these essential assets because only the banks have access to Uncle Ben Bernankio teller window.  For the rest of us, deflation in jobs,housing, employment.  Step 5A - the US becomes a corporate-kleptocracy like Italy or Spain.    If you are not vigilant, your 201K will likely turn into a 101K so best to take the above model into consideration the next time you vote or invest.    Best,    KT      \\"The issue which has swept down the centuries and which will have to be fought sooner or later is the People versus the Banks.\\"      Lord Acton - who, by the way, also wrote: \\"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\"

0812580346|4.0|I got the book so I could try to extrapolate how  TV Series might have ended.  It turns out that the TV Series is too much different from the book.  First, let me say there probably wasn't any thought put into writing a good ending or an ending at all.  What TV producers and writers are interested in, is making a compelling show that keeps you coming back next week.  They don't want it to end and it never will end if viewers keep coming back.  Daytime Soaps are a good example of this.  A TV series with an ending is call a \\"Minnie Series\\".  A good ending for Fashforward was probably never in the cards and if it was, they should have probably tried to convince viewers of it.   I think a lot of viewers stayed away or left early because they were burned by \\"Lost\\".  In hind sight, that was a good move.   The best strategy for TV series, is to wait until it over and if it's good, rent the DVD's.    Now to the book.  I would have loved it if I hadn't seen the TV series.  The \\"Flash Forward\\" idea was a brilliant concept by Robert J. Sawyer.  And I really enjoyed pondering all of the ramifications.  But since I was exposed to it first by the TV Series, the WOW factor was all used up.   So the first part of the book was a rehash of what I already knew.  The next problem with the book (for someone who saw the series) is the book has fewer characters and  a straight forward story, where as the screen play adapted Sawyers wonderful Flash Forward idea into a much richer story with many more characters and multiple story lines.  It may sound like I'm panning the book, but I'm not.  Once I got into it and I really enjoyed the read and couldn't put it down.  And Sawyers story has a very interesting ending.  I sure wish I had read the book and before the TV series.  As long as I'm wishing.  I wish someone would take the TV Series and write a good ending and make it into a movies or a 5 or 6 hour \\"Mini-Series\\".

B003ITZBW2|4.0|I want to start off by saying that my all time favorite film is The Dark Knight. That said, this movie takes the Gotham Nolan created and brings it to its animated roots. All the way down to the train that Batman fought Ras Al Ghul on, in Batman Begins. Now for the movie at hand, Under The Red Hood is a great addition to the collection of animated comic book films. The dark, gothic presentation is perfect. The pacing is perfect as well. This one is a bit longer than usual. It's still only an hour and fifteen minutes, but I thought it was perfectly paced, and ended when it should. Under The Red Hood is more mature, and that's what we want when it comes to Batman. Superman can be childish, but Batman is supposed to be mature. This movie reminded me of Marvel a few times. First of all, the Red Hood himself looks a lot like Deadpool (my favorite comic book character). He also reminded me of Daredevil when he and Batman faced off on the roof of a church.<br /><br />There was another villain in the movie by the name of Black Mask. He looked exactly like Red Skull from Captain America comics, except his face was black. And he ran the crime in Gotham like the Kingpin runs Hell's Kitchen in Daredevil comics. There was also a brief fight between Batman, Nightwing and a Superman-like android called Amazo, who happened to do the Hulk Smash. He was also very much like the Terminator. He rises out of fire with half of his metal face exposed and a bright red eye. All of the times they did something like that, which had already been done, I considered it homage. There are some nice winks to other sci-fi flicks. in a positive light. So, there's another Marvel reminder.<br /><br />The action was great. It was a bit over the top and unrealistic, but it's a cartoon. Why not do things that couldn't be done in live action? They really took me out of it though, because there were a bunch of explosions (some of which the characters were actually inside the exploding building), yet no one seemed to get hurt by them. A few scratches on the face aren't good enough. I'd expect dismemberment from the kinds of punishment the characters went through in this movie. Of course, it is a kid's movie at heart, so they can push limits, but not too far. There is a bit of mild profanity, so I wonder who the target audience is. I'd think it would be older fans, like myself. But the mix of mature subject matter and violence with unrealistic physics and explosion damage is a bit immature.<br /><br />Either way, the negatives really brought the quality of the overall film down. If it were not for the unrealistic explosion damage and people jumping from buildings across the street (like Marvel's live action adaptation of Daredevil), I would have given it a 5/5. That's how much it took me out of the movie. I'm ranting, but the positives far outweigh the negatives. The writing is actually very good. There was a good amount of humor, even though some of the more juvenile jokes fell flat. Also, the fantastic mystery aspect of most Batman movies (he is the world's best detective) didn't last very long. We find out who the Red Hood is way too early, but hey. It's not a long movie anyway. I also think fans will be satisfied by the long list of characters who make an appearance.<br /><br />The Joker, the Red Hood, the Riddler, Ras Al Ghul, the Fearsome Hand of Four, Amazo and Black Mask are all of the villains that make an appearance. Don't worry though, they are balanced perfectly. Batman, Robin and Nightwing are the heroes that make an appearance. Of course, what is a Batman movie without Alfred? He's in it too. I loved the connection to the Gotham that Chris Nolan created. There were a few scenes very reminiscent of scenes in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. If you've seen those two movies as many times as I have, then you should spot them right away. If not, then oh well. The score was another aspect that was directly linked to Nolan's. The music in this movie was very much like the music in The Dark Knight. Some of the musical themes were identical. So, all in all, I really liked this one. I got the blu ray, but just noticed that my review is for the dvd. Anyway, the blu ray is perfect. Lots of worthwhile features, amazing video and audio. Get it!Knight.

I can't help but laugh at the genius of these stories!! So glad I was able to get this for my Kindle!!!
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|I liked the first one and thought the Joker was way too Psychotic and Batman was always 3 steps behind him and got his ASS Kicked!    LOSER!
B00005JM02|4.0|our other one was scratched so it's nice to have one that works. the kids love the movie.I'm very happy with my purchase.
B000001ESF|5.0|It's clear to me that this band is one of the most talented, musically inclined, and educated groups ever to live. As we near 2012 it is clear that this album was written to express to and tantalize the whole world with the actuality of how the world will be 100 years after all the planets in our solar system align. The Aztecs were great astronomers and mathematicians.
B003SHZPCK|5.0|Awesome soundtrack coupled with a storyline that makes you want to see Volume II immediately. UT is great as the vengeful bride and the exaggerated violence - severed arms showering blood etc - is awesome to see. I know it may sound corny, but somehow, it really fits the movie. If you like bad a** women, catchy music and have a sense of humor regarding excessive on-screen violence - do not hesitate to see Kill Bill.
092389165X|1.0|This review may annoy people who feel strongly about the book or the incident, but Hiroshima really is the driest read imaginable. I had to teach it to an extension English class and when the time came to discussing the text, all 24 students owned up to not reading it because it bored them senseless. I couldn't feel angry about that because I too found it so dull that I struggled to get through it. I ended up supplementing it with other non-fiction texts. Three successive classes have all proclaimed it the most \\"boring\\" book they have ever been asked to read for English. This review is more for teachers pondering using it as a study text. Don't! Your students will thank you for it.
030726999X|5.0|This book was excellent. Hard to put down. Has a lot going on and a lot to mentally process.
1416562605|2.0|This is one of those books that sneakily hooks your interest with a very engaging start but becomes steadily duller the further you read. The narrator is humorous and a forceful personality but I found him difficult to like. The novel lags a little in places and is quite bleak. I know a lot of people really enjoyed this book, but unfortunately I was not among them. I think it was well written but I was relieved when I'd finished it.
B002N1RM5A|5.0|I think that Kaufmann is a fabulous singer, but I was prepared to be critical here. The gold standard is, after all, Fritz Wunderlich. You can't compare the two voices, of course, but JK has wonderful phrasing and his diction is immaculate. Well done!
B00000JSJC|2.0|First off, I REALLY love this movie. I wish I could do two ratings; one for the movie and one for the disc. But I can't so this is only about the disc.<br /><br />My biggest dislike is that this movie was not put to disc using the anamorphic widescreen technology. Instead it was matted with the black letter box bars, essentially hard-letterboxing the picture. This wasn't of much concern to me when I originally purchased the movie because I was watching it on an SD 4:3 TV. Now that I am using a 16:9 HD TV what I get is letter box bars AND pillar box bars, essentially reducing my 32in TV to a 22in TV.<br /><br />I am hoping for a blu-ray version to be released so that I can see this film in all it's intended glory.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, pillar box bars have their place when viewing 4:3 content on a 16:9 screen. But when the picture is supposed to be 16:9 or better (2.35:1, etc...) then having both pillar box bars and letter box bars together just makes me feel cheated.
B003AMAOW4|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann is a magnificent Lohengrin, and he is evenly matched by Anja Harteros whose pure, clear sound makes her one of the best Elsas ever. The rest of the cast was also excellent, with Michaela Schuster as the weakest link. She's good, but if you remember Christa Ludwig or Ursula Schröder-Feinen, or going further back, Margarete Klose ... Well, enough said.   Now the bad news (but not all bad). The Regietheater production has a few things to recommend it (e.g., a beautifully staged bridal chamber scene), but the nonsensical clothes worn by the chorus and Kaufmann's blue T-shirt and track pants ... Richard Jones, what were you thinking??  What I thought was striking was the juxtaposition of the two beautiful, black-haired outsiders against the Aryans (Schuster as a Nazi dominatrix). Of course, this only works with these two particular singers.  Still, the singing is so phenomenal that nothing else really matters.
1401323820|4.0|If you're a fan of Castle (TV show) you should like this book. It seemed kind of tongue-in-cheek for the first few pages but after I got deeper in the plot I enjoyed the book and it was a quick read. I don't know who wrote it but they did a good job and I will order 'Naked Heat' when it's released.
B00005NGAG|5.0|First, don't read any reviews where they tell you what the movie is about. Surprise yourself because it's a cake filling full of comedy-of-errors with a frosting of self-correcting mishaps that result in a tasty snack of everyone gets what they deserve -  Oh! Joy Joy (Ren & Stimpy).<br />Second, quite original script for this done before plot. Great performances by all. Interesting filming angles and sets, so kudos to filming crew and director. Third, nice blend of an appropriate seven oldies and newbies music; not overwhelming - just right.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|One of my all time favorite movies is Aliens. I liked Alien alot as well but not enough to watch it five million times like I have with Aliens. Alien III was a slap in the face to the fans and the 4th was just plain terrible.    While I'm hopeful that this release will be awesome I do have a few concerns.    In no particular order of importance:    #1 Will the special features,commentary etc be the same stuff we have seen on previous special editions?    #2 As others have already posted, what will the picture quality be like?     #3 Don't assume that James Cameron has anything at all to do with this. He might, but he doesn't own the rights to Aliens or the characters he created. The studio (Fox?) can do whatever they want with them. If Cameron had any pull then Aliens vs Predator would NEVER have been made.    #4 James Cameron has said in the past that it would be difficult to transfer Aliens to HD becuase of the type of film he used for that movie. He said it would be too grainy for HD.
0307454541|5.0|I'm discussing the trilogy first, and then I review this specific book (#1) at the end below.  Most of my reviews are romance novels, but this series is not.  I only mention it so that other romance lovers might consider it.<br /><br />THE TRILOGY:<br /><br />STORY BRIEF:<br />The three books must be read in order.  This is a hugely popular best-selling mystery suspense thriller about a few members of the Swedish national police organization forming a \\"special section\\" doing illegal things.  To shut up a 12-year-old witness, they have her placed in a mental institution.  Her name is Lisbeth Salander.  Mikhail Blomkvist is an investigative journalist.  In book 1, Salander who is now 24 helps Blomkvist solve a mystery about a woman who disappeared.  In books 2 and 3, Salander has a variety of problems resulting from \\"special section\\" activities.  A number of interesting characters are involved.  Some are helpful and others try to hurt Salander.<br /><br />ABOUT THE TITLES:<br />The primary theme for the books is \\"Men Who Hate Women,\\" which is the Swedish title for the first book.  I much prefer the Swedish title over the English-language title.  The tattoo title feels superficial and meaningless when compared to the Swedish title.  The titles in order are:<br />The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo  (Swedish Title: Men Who Hate Women)<br />The Girl Who Played With Fire  (Swedish Title:  same)<br />The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest (Swedish Title:  The Air Castle Blows Up)  The Air Castle in Swedish means a complex structure based on nothing.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION OF ALL THREE BOOKS:<br />I want happy endings when I read books, and I was definitely satisfied and happy at the ends of books 1 and 3.  I know I will continue to think about Salander and this story well into the future.  Book 1 can be read as a stand-alone, but I wanted more Salander so I bought book 2.  Book 2 stops in the middle of the story which is ok as long as you get book 3 to keep reading right away.  I loved the three books.  This is not a predictable, run-of-the-mill mystery thriller.  There are a wide range of characters and plot intricacies that are wonderfully well done.  I was so taken with these books that I bought the audio versions AND the paper versions for books 2 and 3.  I've never done that before.  That way I could continue with the story when I was driving and doing kitchen work.  I would switch to the hard copy when sitting.<br /><br />In the first book, Salander felt like a modern day replacement for Sherlock Holmes, but very different.  They both are brilliant in their special skills, and draw my admiration.  However, Salander is gritty, edgy, and anti-authority.  She despises the police and refuses to allow them to have information about anything.  There was a lot of action with Salander in the last half of the first book.  I loved reading about her.  I was hoping to see a lot of action with Salander in books 2 and 3 - seeing her solve other mysteries and doing damage to bad guys.  But that didn't happen.  Books 2 and 3 are more about other characters doing things - murders, cover-ups, and investigating - but it was all surrounding and relating to Salander.  She had less action than I wanted in the last two books.  But still, I fully enjoyed books 2 and 3.<br /><br />The English-language film of the first book will be in theaters in 2011.  Daniel Craig will play journalist Mikael Blomkvist.  Unfortunately, as with most movies, there's no way it will be as rich as the books.<br /><br />ABOUT THE AUTHOR:<br />Steig Larsson wrote these three books, submitted them to a publisher, and then died before they were published.  He had written half of a fourth book which I believe his girlfriend may be finishing.  He had an outline and planned to write several more in the series.  I am sad for the loss of the author and for the loss of his further writing.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />REVIEW OF BOOK 1: THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />I listened to the audiobook version and sometimes found it difficult to keep the names straight.  The narrator is good, but there are so many Swedish names (people and towns) that are hard to follow if you're not used to it.  I recommend reading the book (not the audiobook) and taking a few notes with names.  I can't remember if it was the first third or more, but it was slow.  It was also setting things up.  There is a lot of \\"telling\\" about things happening in the past.  The second half is more action and \\"showing.\\"  If you look \\"Inside the Book\\" on Amazon, there is a Vanger Family Tree which is helpful.  The last half was fantastic and definitely worth the read.  I was surprised, amazed, and couldn't put it down.  It's creative and excellent.  Caution for sensitive readers: there is unsettling rear-door rape and torture.<br /><br />THE MAIN CHARACTER:<br />Salander is haunting, intriguing, and powerful in unexpected ways.  She has a terrifying capacity for ruthlessness.  She is 24, 4 feet 11, weighs 90 pounds, has tattoos, and looks like a punk teenager.  Some of her personality traits appear similar to Asperger's syndrome, but she is sociable if she wants to be.  She is one of the best computer hackers in the country.  Her mother's in an institution.  Salander is a ward of the State with a guardian controlling her finances.  The State believes she is mentally incompetent.  She doesn't care what they think as long as she can get her money when needed, and they \\"leave her alone.\\"  She becomes the top investigator for a private investigating firm.<br /><br />STORY BRIEF:<br />Book 1 includes three stories.  (1) Salander has problems with guardians and being a ward of the State.  (2) Blomkvist is a journalist who printed an article about Wennerstrom, is sued for libel, and will be going to jail for three months.  (3) Blomkvist is hired to investigate the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, which happened 37 years ago.  Blomkvist learns about Salander and hires her to help investigate Harriet's disappearance which has something to do with a serial killer.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Audiobook length: 16 hours.

0143038583|2.0|In this book, Michael Pollan shows himself to be a master storyteller. Unfortunately, stories aren't just a way to communicate facts while keeping the reader engaged. One might even say that the facts are secondary to the stories. Rather than base stories on the facts, Pollan chooses stories to fit an overarching reactionary thesis: The best way to eat is following nature and tradition, and our attempts at progress only make things worse. The facts, then, are worked into his narratives, but sometimes they don't really fit.    Science is one victim of Pollan's reactionary thesis. Nutritional science receives part of the blame for America's health problems. \\"We place our faith in science to sort out for us what culture once did with rather more success\\" (303), he writes. Yet much of his evidence that \\"we place our faith in science\\" lies in our susceptibility to weight-loss diets and food fads that aren't supported by scientific consensus. Moreover, he seems oblivious to the successes of nutritional science in curing nutrient deficiencies, some of which existed in traditional diets.    Science also receives unfair treatment in the agricultural context. Pollan attempts to summarize parts of Sir Albert Howard's [[ASIN:B003IKT72Q An Agricultural Testament]], which he calls the organic movement's bible. Yet he makes Howard's work out to be some sort of anti-science treatise, when it just isn't. Pollan concludes from Howard's treatment of humus, \\"To reduce such a vast biological complexity to [nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium] represented the scientific method at its reductionist worst\\" (147). While Howard offers plenty of criticism of modern agricultural science in particular, he does not criticize the scientific method more broadly. Indeed, he even calls aspects of conventional agriculture unscientific, proposes a few scientific experiments, and expresses his hope that science be among the tools of the agricultural investigators of the future. Howard's work isn't an argument against science. It's an argument for better science.    Pollan's chapters on the fast food chain are probably his strongest, but even there he occasionally oversteps. For example, he suggests that E. coli O157:H7 live only on feedlot cattle, when the scientific literature indicates that this deadly strain of bacteria is about as prevalent in grass-fed cattle. Later, he goes on to include one of the active ingredients in baking powder on a list of \\"quasiedible substances \\" (113), apparently because of its chemical name. In both of these instances, he criticizes something new -- feedlots in the first and baking powder in the second -- with the effect of making something traditional seem more appealing.    The primary beneficiary of the reactionary narrative is the pastoral food chain, as represented by Joel Salatin's Polyface Farm. Even as Salatin describes his farm is a \\"postindustrial enterprise\\" (191), he explains that in some sense his farming methods aren't really new at all; they imitate the ecological relationships that exist in nature. To Pollan the farm is \\"a scene of almost classic pastoral beauty\\" (124). Its product, he says, \\"looks an awful lot like the proverbially unattainable free lunch\\" (127).    Pollan credits Salatin's farming methods with revitalizing Polyface's soil without chemical fertilizers. In particular, he writes, \\"The chief reason Polyface Farm is completely self-sufficient in nitrogen is that a chicken, defecating copiously, pays a visit to virtually every square foot of it at several points during the season.\\" (210)    It's hard to tell whether he grasps the fact that the nitrogen in the chickens' feces comes from the food they eat, eighty percent of which is grain-based feed from off the farm. What is certain, though, is that he doesn't raise the question of what is happening to the land where that feed is grown. We would expect from the earlier chapters that the corn and soy in the feed was grown on a farm that was less classic, less pastoral, and less beautiful than Polyface, so it's striking that Pollan should choose not to look further. He also doesn't bother to discuss the question of whether that feed grain might be more efficiently used to feed people directly (as my calculations indicate it would). Either of these questions would be raised in a more fact-driven work, but there's simply no room for them here, as the answers might not fit the thesis.  (Of course, when Pollan later mentions \\"a denial of reality that can be its own form of hubris\\" (361), he's talking about the vegetarians.)    As for the chickens, Pollan buys into Salatin's argument that they are a purely artisanal product. He doesn't mention that they are the same Cornish Cross hens that in the context of his Whole Foods meal represented \\"the pinnacle of industrial chicken breeding,\\" and which \\"grow so rapidly...that their poor legs cannot keep pace\\" (171).    Pollan also points out that Salatin's pastures remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. There's no mention, however, of the carbon dioxide emissions resulting from Salatin's hugely inefficient distribution system, which involves large numbers of cars traveling long distances to the farm. (This omission comes even after he's told us about the fossil fuels used to transport his industrial organic fruits and vegetables from distant farms.) When Pollan tells us that one customer drives 150 miles each way to the farm, it's merely to be taken as proof of the quality of Polyface meats. There's no mention of any environmental impact.    Where Pollan's dedication to his reactionary thesis is perhaps most obvious is in his discussion of vegetarianism. For although there are prominent conservative vegetarians (Matthew Scully among them), vegetarianism today is rooted in a progressive idea. It requires us to accept that we can do something, namely eat, better than our ancestors did it. Indeed, Pollan writes, \\"Vegetarianism is more popular than it has ever been, and animalrights, the fringiest of fringe movements until just a few years ago, is rapidly finding its way into the cultural mainstream. I'm not completely sure why this should be happening now, given that humans have been eating animals for tens of thousands of years without too much ethical heartburn\\" (305).    Vegetarianism is something new, and his preferred hypothesis for its recent success is the weakening of our traditions: \\"But it could also be that the cultural norms and rituals that used to allow people to eat meat without agonizing about it have broken down for other reasons. Perhaps as the sway of tradition in our eating decisions weakens, habits we once took for granted are thrown up in the air, where they're more easily buffeted by the force of a strong idea or the breeze of fashion.\\" (306)    Being something new and representing a challenge to age-old traditions, vegetarianism simply doesn't fit with Pollan's reactionary message. In the reactionary view, it doesn't make much more sense than high-fructose corn syrup or factory farms. As such, it doesn't receive serious consideration.    Even before his section on the ethics of eating animals, there are signs that he won't take his debate seriously. He tells us, for example, that his friends' son is \\"fifteen and currently a vegetarian\\" (271), as though vegetarianism is merely a teenage phase. He also makes no secret of the fact that he's already made the decision to go hunting even before tackling the ethical issues associated with eating animals.    Pollan gives up meat for a while, inspired by an argument of Peter Singer: \\"No one in the habit of eating an animal can be completely without bias in judging whether the conditions in which that animal is reared cause suffering\\" (312). Yet he identifies himself as \\"a reluctant and, I fervently hoped, temporary vegetarian\\" (313), so it's not at all clear that the experiment does anything to lessen his bias.    As a vegetarian, Pollan struggles with the social ramifications of eating differently. He points out that \\"my new dietary restrictions throw a big wrench into the basic host-guest relationship\\" (313) and decides, \\"I'm inclined to agree with the French, who gaze upon any personal dietary prohibition as bad manners\\" (313). Yet he'll find himself able to justify only a very limited kind of meat-eating, which likewise represents a \\"personal dietary prohibition.\\" He then proceeds to discuss his alienation from traditions like the Passover brisket, apparently not allowing for the possibility that traditions might evolve over time. This rigid view of tradition is an odd one considering his plans to hunt an unkosher pig.    Pollan then moves on to a discussion of animal rights philosophy. He claims to be debating Peter Singer, but he'll quote Matthew Scully when it better suits his point, never acknowledging any significant difference between the writers. Other times, he'll just quote Singer out of context.    Pollan eventually argues for meat-eating on the grounds that it serves the interests of domesticated species, which would cease to exist if people didn't eat them. He doesn't do much in the way of building up the argument, only hinting at how the interest of a species might be defined and not even beginning to explain why such an interest is more important than the individuals.    Instead of building that argument, Pollan relays a story intended to show that animal activists are out of touch with nature. As Pollan tells it, The Nature Conservancy and the National Park Service need to kill feral pigs to save Santa Cruz Island's endangered fox, and the animal rights and welfare people oppose the plan out of a single-minded concern for animal welfare. However, the very same Humane Society op-ed that Pollan cites to prove this point actually includes a substantive discussion of the project's ecological goals. Moreover, Pollan does not address any of the more scholarly objections to the project, such as Jo-Ann Shelton's argumentthat the restoration of Santa Cruz Island is motivated by human interest.    Pollan then launches into a section called \\"The Vegan Utopia,\\" where he points out practical difficulties of a vegan world. First, he reminds us that harvesting grains kills animals. It's a true statement that people who care about animals should keep in mind, but Pollan goes on to suggest that we would minimize animal deaths by basing our diets on large ruminants. That claim is an apparent reference to a study that was quickly debunked. He then argues that a vegan world would force places like New England to import all of their food from distant places. It's a dubious claim in view of existing production of soy, wheat, and vegetables in New England. He even goes so far as to suggest that the vegan food chain would be more dependent on fossil fuels and chemical fertilizers than our current food system. Thanks to the inefficiency of feeding grain to animals, that claim is almost certainly false.    As B.R. Myers has pointed out, Pollan does not mention a single thing he ate in his time as a vegetarian. Over the course of the book, Pollan describes at least ten meat-based meals, four of those in exquisite detail, so it's telling that he doesn't consider vegetarian cuisine to be worth writing about.    Pollan goes hunting, shoots his sow, and even enjoys the experience. Yet when he finds himself disgusted by the sights and smells of cleaning the pig, Pollan can't help but take one more jab at vegetarians. He expresses pity for the \\"tofu eater\\" for his \\"dreams of innocence\\" (361), seemingly rejecting the idea that we should even try to do better.    In spite of all these points of contention, I should acknowledge that Pollan gets plenty right in the book. There's a lot that's wrong with modern industrial food production. Making bad changes to our food supply has had profound negative consequences for the environment, public health, and animal welfare. On these topics, Pollan can remain faithful to his reactionary thesis while still representing the facts reasonably well. And so a reader learns about things like the psychology of supersizing, the environmental toll of growing corn to feed ruminants, and the miserable life of a battery-caged layer hen.    I suspect that many people find the information about industrial animal agriculture more powerful because they come from an author who so roundly rejects vegetarianism. After relaying the horrors of forced-molting and cannibalism in battery cages, Pollan writes, \\"I know, simply reciting these facts, most of which are drawn from poultry trade magazines, makes me sound like one of the animal people, doesn't it? I don't mean to (remember, I got into this vegetarian deal assuming I could go on eating eggs), but this is what can happen to you when...you look\\" (318). It's much harder for a reader to dismiss a message as the sentimental ramblings of one of the \\"animal people\\" when it's coming from somebody who enjoys beating up on vegetarians.    In this way, this book brings awareness about important issues to a wide audience. The fact of it being such an enjoyable read further expands that audience. However, it should be at most a starting point for those learning about where their food comes from because the underlying reactionary premise sometimes leads Pollan astray. We live in a world that is increasingly unnatural and unlike the one that shaped our cultural traditions. Our population is growing, our planet is warming, and our values and lifestyles have evolved. It doesn't make sense for our food chain to remain in the past. As innovations like battery cages and high-fructose corn syrup show, not all ideas are good ones, but that shouldn't stop us from trying to make progress. The future will present us with new challenges, and we'd do well to keep an open mind to new solutions.
B002RAREAK|5.0|I didn't have very high hopes for this CD because after listening to \\"Here I Stand,\\" I pretty much gave up of ever wanting to listen to Usher again.  Thankfully, my husband is a fan so during a four hour road trip, we popped this CD in and after just one listen of the entire CD, I am so happy Usher is back with his signature sound.  I was sure there would be only one or two really good songs but no true.  I like all of the songs (though I least like \\"OMG\\").  If you enjoy Usher's music, you will not be disappointed at all with this CD.
0399156577|5.0|As always Roberts gives us a well-researched look into a realm of an unusual profession and a detailed sense of place.  The story takes unexpected twists and looks at modern romance between independent talented individuals. Diverse and pleasant feature characters.  The stalker had an interesting start but becomes a stereotype, but aren't they all?  A very good read.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|I hate to say this but Sheldon needs to get more often, what a great episode!!
B000000OEI|1.0|This music is not stirring, evocative or powerful. It is trite, banal and unimaginative.  The whole style derives from a frankly naive grasp of classical harmony/orchestration and sets a new benchmark for film compositional mediocrity. John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith and Bernard Hermann proved that film music does not have to be simplistic for ordinary people to be moved by it. I don't understand why Zimmer's abysmal score writing (perfectly exemplified in this movie) is indulged at all.
B003J27WFW|5.0|This movie is incredible!!!  Better than I thought it would be.  A must see for any RUSH fan, and anyone who is NOT a fan should watch it, too!  I had 2 people watch it that were not fans and they really liked and enjoyed the movie.  They now have a new respect for the band.  I've been waiting for something like this since I was 15 years old.  Thanks to the guys who made it and thanks to RUSH, for never giving in to \\"the man\\" and always growing and exploring with your music!

1597801585|5.0|The Windup Girl, Paolo Bacigalupi's debut novel, is the kind of future dystopia story that is all the more disturbing because it is plausible. Set in the near future, in a world where bio-engineered plagues have wiped out the world's food sources-making plague-resistant bio-engineered foods necessary to keep the world fed-and the age of petroleum power  is gone, it is easy to read this novel and think \\"I can see this happening.\\"    There are so many things about this novel that I liked, it is difficult for me to articulate. The writing is beautiful to read: descriptive, tight, and moving. The prose describes a setting one can almost reach out and touch without devolving into excessive description that begs the reader to skim through for the point. The characters are believable, multi-faceted,  and appealing, so even though their personal goals are often at cross purposes, I had a difficult time actively rooting against anyone. As a corollary to that idea, there is no hard-and-fast villain here, no distinct white or black hat. Each character just is, and it is the reader's own take on the characters' goals and actions that will decide the idea of right or wrong. It's nice to read a novel that has a somewhat ambiguous ending: hopeful for some people, devastating for others, and for one, wholly unresolved. It is the perfect conclusion to this story, because canned `happily ever after' and `everyone dies' endings would have been a disservice to a complicated tale.    Bacigalupi has done an excellent job of writing the differing perspectives of several different characters, weaving the different perspectives and stories of the characters through the novel's narrative, giving each character not only a unique voice, but believable attitudes, strategies for meeting challenges, belief systems, and cultural cues that are as varied as the characters' backgrounds suggest. Maybe it sounds strange that I am excited about this, but too often I see characters that are supposed to be from different cultures, yet they act-and react-the same. This is not a problem here; each character's personality and (cultural) perspective is unique.    Reading The Windup Girl felt, in many ways, like reading a series of juxtapositions: lush, gorgeous prose next to a brutal depiction of reality; a Western company man next to the Thais and Chinese surrounding him in Bangkok; bio-engineered foodstuffs next to the fruit of carefully preserved seed stock. The City of Divine Beings (Bangkok), as described here is the playground of the elite and the cramped tenements of refugees and the poor, deliciously rich in history and tradition and on yet the cusp of great change.    In sum, I loved this book. It isn't an easy read, and it isn't something that will only momentarily be entertaining. The people, the place, and the possibilities will stay with you. Anderson Lake, Emiko, Hock Seng, Jaidee, Kanya, the city itself-they will all capture your attention and demand to be heard. This is the sort of thoughtful, provoking narrative that encapsulates not only the best of what science fiction can be, but the best that fiction-literature-can be. The stories that really last, the ones we feel we need to read over and over, are these.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This comment refers only to the upcoming Blu-ray release.  The price, here on Amazon, started at $62.99 and now it's jumped to $80.99.  And this movie hasn't even been issued on Blu-Ray yet!  To quote Moe the bartender----\\"Whaaaaaa?\\"  Think I'll wait till the price drops to between $15.00 - $20.00 where it should be for a single disc Blue-ray edition.
B000FC11A6|2.0|Plain and simply, this book is a chore to read. The concepts are interesting, but Stephensons digressions into math theory or the minutiae of business start-up planning or the neurosis of post-structuralist academics are overly detailed, self important, and dull. Many of the main characters are not developed. In the case of the nearly autistic math genius Waterhouse, this is perhaps a literary mechanism. In the case of the other characters it is unforgivable. In addition the women in the book are one dimensional, they only exist as objects of sexual interest for the men. So think twice before buying this book.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|\\"Men in Black\\" was a classic comedy. Unfortunately! As we all know, successful movies crave sequels. And the sequels are usually...bunk.<br /><br />So I wasn't surprised when I watched \\"Men in Black II\\". Yes indeed, it's much worse than the original. To fill in the general lack of plot development, humour and pretty much everything else, we get an extra dosage of that funny dog from the first movie. And, of course, the \\"worms\\" from the coffee machine situation. Yeah, very funny. Not! And what's all this stuff about Moses and Santa Claus being stashed away in a safety deposit box on Grand Central?<br /><br />Not even Donna from Twin Peaks can save \\"MIB II\\". I mean, with that make up, she looks about 20 years older than she actually is. Talk about spoiling a gorgeous actor.<br /><br />The only fun part of \\"MIB II\\" is the ending, where agent K reveals that *we* are stashed away in a safety deposit box on a foreign planet, inhabited by stressed, gigantic alien commuters.<br /><br />Well, it's nice to know that some problems are, indeed, of truly cosmic proportions.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Silly, half-creative, B-movie \\"horror\\" soap for the modern age. That the story takes itself seriously gives it a faint waft of black humour, a fine line that many HBO shows tend to ride.  This show is just ridiculous and yet I keep watching just to see what new absurdity will crop up.  The story lines are ludicrous, the characters and scenes nearly always have me on the edge of laughter - and yet, they'll come up with some new unseen twist in the story that brings me back in with renewed interest.   OK, of course you don't come to this show for beleivablity, but even within it's own logic, you have to be prepared for a few plot holes and far out plot devices.   It's got the narration style and character depth of a comic book, but it's all in good fun - I'd be lying if I said I haven't come to enjoy it.      The first seven episodes are not \\"glued to your set\\" television moments.  More like you can do other things like surf on-line and only half tune in while characters engage in yet more over-the-top cliched dialogues.  It's a vampire soap with all the key HBO ingredients, sex, drugs, and language.  The whole \\"V\\" addiction thing was pretty interesting, as were exorcisms, and some other surprises.  Of course this show re-defines for us what a vampire is, and it's cleverness is that their whole race has entered the modern American world of PC and is struggling for an accepted place in mainstream society.  Funny!  By episode 7 I was starting to watch a little closer and with more genuine interest.  I wouldn't put it on par with classier HBO fare \\"Six Feet Under\\", \\"Sopranos\\", \\"The Wire\\", \\"Damages\\", \\"Breaking Bad\\" (AMC), or even \\"Dexter\\" (Showtime).  But as much as I know this show is ridiculous I still find myself watching it and often (but not always) with more than half interest.  This wouldn't be a series I'd recommend first to my friends, and I don't think it warrants the price.  But I accept what the show has become for me - a guilty (half) pleasure.  Vampires, shapeshifters, telepaths and \\"V\\" - I admit I enjoy the show when I'm not busy lambasting Sookie's latest tantrum to either one of her lovers or yet another one of Tera's overbearing tirades.  It's always a joy as well to see what kind of new and ridiculous plot device is going to crop up.  Like I said, a guilty pleasure. In spite of it's clever moments - and there are a few unquestionably - there are just many moments of cliche drivel.  Or put another way, in spite of it's cliche moments, there are more than few clever and interesting plot hooks in this series that might make a beleiver out of you.  Or not.  Your call.  But chances are if you make it to the 7th episode, you'll be hooked on True Blood.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I was sorely disappointed in this adaptation of the novel. The action moved at a snail's pace. The actors, those portraying Anne and Wentworth in particular, exhibited little emotion or empathy for one another other than strange stares.   The dialogue was hard to follow because some of the actors swallowed their words. The actor portraying Anne's father is a case in point. Maybe if I were from England I would better understand him. I was tempted to use the close captioning at times.    I can't really classify this one as a romance because the actors left me cold. No romance there.I gave it one star, but it didn't even deserve that one. If this were my only experience with Jane Austen, I would be hard put to understand her reputation as a writer.She must be turning over in her grave.
B002ZG980U|2.0|Mega explosions, ultra car chases, repetitive buildings toppling---if this is your idea of testosterone fueled summer entertainment---then go for it. Oh yeah, multiple assassins around every corner. A brilliant concept almost completely ruined by too much action and too many characters. It becomes completely overwhelming when the dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream, culminates in some sort of \\"Ice Station Zebra(esque)\\" nonsense. JEEZ--the audience needs a breather!    DiCaprio's talents are completely wasted. The subplot with the dead wife was strangely reminiscent and done much better in \\"Shutter Island.\\" Gordon-Levitt was miscast(way too young for the part). Ellen Page fares slightly better as the so-called \\"dream architect.\\"    Kudos for the awesome art direction and set design--I would bet my bottom dollar an Oscar or two is definetly in store.    I really wanted to like this movie--but in an eggshell--it was just TOO MUCH.
1843117789|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moJAY5457I7TDS]]FOR THE PRACTITIONER AND ARBITRATOR<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />In the words of Merkin and Flannery, the Arbitration Act 1996 `was intended to be both a fresh start and the closest thing to a definitive code of arbitration law that has ever been enacted in England'. This book is the definitive referencer for the statute.<br /><br />This, the latest 4th edition of `Arbitration Act 1996' published at the end of 2008 follows the publication in 1996 of `Arbitration Act 1996: An Annotated Guide' in followed in turn by a 2nd edition in 2000, a 3rd edition in 2005 - all by the same expert authors.  Even in the 3 years that elapsed between the third and fourth editions, so much new case law has emerged that a new edition of this definitive work became necessary... and with a view to taking a fresh look at the Act.<br /><br />The fourth edition therefore endeavours to cover all the major decisions emanating from the English courts, in particular from the Commercial Court and the Technology and Construction Court, where most matters related to arbitration are most commonly heard.<br /><br />An outstandingly helpful feature for the practitioner, members of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and those involved as arbitrators will be the detailed notes appended to each section.  These notes explain the meaning of the section and cite the relevant cases which deal with the interpretation of the wording of the section which can make some sense to us as users.<br /><br />So, whatever section of the Act you are looking up, you have the expert views of meaning and interpretation immediately to hand.<br />As a clear and comprehensive review of the present state of the 1996 Act, this erudite volume excels. The deliberations that led to the passing of the Act are well explained and its provisions are examined in detail, with particular problem areas highlighted.<br /><br />Specific Civil Procedure Rules (CPR), as they affect applications to the court, are referred to and include cross-references to the Departmental Advisory Committee Reports upon which the Act is based.<br />Also included is the full text of the Act, Part 62 of the Civil Procedure Rules and the Departmental Advisory Committee reports.<br />In particular, and in addition to the wealth of new cases cited in this edition, there are three cases included which illustrate several issues of principle concerning the Act: Premium Nafta (Fiona Trust), West Tankers and Lesotho Highlands).  These issues have been aired in the House of Lords (as it then was) since publication of the 3rd edition.  Also included where possible are the authors' references to significant decisions from other common law jurisdictions to assist overseas arbitrations.<br /><br />As you would expect from an authoritative work of reference such as this, there are extensive Tables of Cases and Legislation, four schedules, nine appendices and a comprehensive index.  The book incorporates cases decided up to the end of Oct. 2008, including the Court of Appeal decision in IPCO Nigeria v NNPC highlighting the definitive nature of this referencer which eases the work of the arbitrator enormously.ions to the court, are referred to and include cross-references to the Departmental Advisory Committee Reports upon which the Act is based.

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Is this movie a joke? A psychic guy running around in LA, killing demons with a crucifix-shaped gun. At one point, he kills a whole bunch with the aid of holy water...coming out from the sprinkler system! A Black voodoo priest called Papa Diavolo or something to that effect. Lucifer is on bad terms with his own son, named Mammon. The archangel Gabriel has a fall out with God and looses his wings. And no-no-no, you can't commit suicide, because if you do, you automatically go to Hell. Chain smoking is another sure method. And Heaven looks like...the Manhattan skyline!<br /><br />Once again, is this a joke?<br /><br />\\"Men in Black II\\" were better.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|I believe now is the right time for Devo, my fellow spuds. Sure, the uninitiated and uninformed will sneer and scoff, and laugh, but that's because all they know is \\"Whip It\\" and the Swiffer commercials.<br /><br />No, really, I give \\"Something For Everybody\\" five stars for several reasons: 1. It's really well put together considering how long the band has been around. 2. We desperately need the obtuse, almost implied sarcastic irony that Devo are so good at peddling. I believe most of Devo's music flies right over the general public's head because all they think about is \\"Whip It\\". That's Devo's genius--subversive themes neatly packaged in 3 minute hummable tunes. A real houswife from -insert location here- could enjoy \\"Something For Everybody\\" and completely miss the boat of subversive lyrical themes.<br /><br />True to form, I went back and listened to every Devo album in sequence leading up to \\"Something For Everybody\\". The band's career has certainly been spotty, particularly \\"Total Devo\\" and \\"Smooth Noodle Maps\\". Still, every album has something good on it, it's just whether the band can deliver a full 12 song set without much filler. \\"Something For Everybody\\" has a consistency not heard from the band since 1980's \\"Freedom Of Choice\\". Again, I am amazed at how well done this new album is given a 20 year absence and nearly 40 years as a band. I think about all the other artists in my music collection who have been around that long and the type of albums they are making. Devo stands apart as being fresh, valid, contemporary.<br /><br />The detractors of this album seem to be few. I get that Devo's first three albums are considered their finest--I get it! But, I am willing to allow for something new if I feel the quality is there. How can you deny the quality found on \\"Something For Everybody\\"? I listened to this album all week, and it just continued to get better and better.<br /><br />I do have one complaint though, and that is why Warner Bros. just didn't allow Devo to release the full 16 song album. Why do we have to have four different versions of the album? I cheated and downloaded and added \\"Watch Us Work It\\", \\"Signal Ready\\" and \\"Let's Get To It\\" to the standard 12 song album I bought. It irked me that lame old iTunes got \\"Knock Boots\\" as an exclusive bonus track.<br /><br />I believe that if radio wasn't so compartmentalized and demographically challenged these days that Devo would have a slew of hits from this album. My top favorites are the following: \\"What We Do\\", \\"Please Baby Please\\", \\"Don't Shoot (I'm A Man)\\", \\"Sumthin'\\", \\"No Place Like Home\\" and \\"March On\\". That, in itself, is quite a few for one album. But the other tracks are equally as solid like \\"Fresh\\", \\"Mind Games\\", \\"Human Rocket\\", \\"Cameo\\", \\"Later Is Now\\". The weakest track is probably \\"Step Up\\", but that's not saying much. The three extra tracks are also good with \\"Watch Us Work It\\" having a catchy chorus, and \\"Signal Ready\\" harking back to those crazy post-punk days I miss so much in today's Lady GaGa'd, Katy Perry'd and Miley Cyrus'd vapid world of music.<br /><br />Five stars because, honestly, I've listened to quite a bit of new music this year and this album stands out as both musically invigorating and intellectually stimulating--in the best subversive Devo way. Five stars, because, after listening to the entire Devo catalog, \\"Something For Everybody\\" lives up to its title and is superior to the last five Devo albums.<br /><br />Here is how \\"Something For Everybody\\" compares to Devo's other work:<br /><br />1978 Q:Are We Not Men? A:We Are Devo!: Five Stars<br />1979 Duty Now For The Future: Four Stars<br />1980 Freedom Of Choice: Five Stars<br />1981 New Traditionalists: Four Stars<br />1982 Oh, No!

1558908846|1.0|The cover for this DVD states that is weidesreen, upgraded for 16x9 televisions.  It's not.  A widescreen TV will show this movie in letterbox format, a small rectangle in the center of the screen.  I've tried three different copies of this movie.  All touted the 16x9 uprgade, but none of the disks were actually anamorphic.
B000P7V45S|1.0|First off, this review deals solely with the 2007 re-master edition. My one star rating is based on the sound quality of the stereo layer of this CD. The 5.1 surround version is interesting but nothing to write home about either. The music is a solid 5-star.    ----------------    This has to be one of the most disappointing CD reissues I've heard in the past 10 years-- truly a shame for such a classic recording.  Do you want an example of the \\"loudness wars\\" in action? This version of Trick of the Tail is compressed to the max in a vain effort to \\"modernize\\" its  '70's era sound. The overall volume is at least 6 db louder than the 1994 re-master. This makes the disc \\"louder\\" at the expense of dynamic range loss. Cymbals lose their shimmer and start to sound like crackling \\"bacon in the pan\\". Phil Collin's doubled vocal tracks seem to be non-existent. The bass is a rumbling mess. The drums don't have that snappy \\"thwack\\" anymore. I won't even go into the guitar tracks. This was one of Steve Hackett's signature Genesis albums IMO. Half of his parts are buried in the brick walled sound of this disc.    In short, your ears will be too fatigued by this sonic mess. I doubt you'll be able to hear the whole thing in one sitting.    Though it also has it's flaws, I would recommend going with the 1994 re-mastered edition of this CD if you can find it. Even the late 80's original Atco version is miles ahead in tonal quality.
1577314808|4.0|I could resume this book in one sentence: Live in the NOW and feel... (ready?)... the power of NOW! Even though E. Tolle is sometimes repetitive I like this book. He gives a good lecture on something essential: by focusing on the present you can let go of the past and not fear the future. This is timeless advice.
B002VPE1XY|3.0|Do you want thrills?  Excitement?  An experience beyond all others that you will take with you for the rest of your life that you will tell your grandchildren about with baited breath?    Well you're out of luck, this is a small leather belt carrying case for a camera or ipod.  It provides none of those things, just basic functionality.  You put things in it, the Velcro snaps, they stay there and it holds.    I can't say it's much better or worse than any other I've seen, Yeah it's a case, yeah it does the job, it looks ok, black goes with everything.    So it's not all that exciting, but it holds the camera.  Then again you could take the camera ON a great adventure and this would hold it while you record those thrills and adventures.  So maybe it's more exciting than I thought.
B000UAFDP2|4.0|Good movie, but I learned the hard way that it may not play in Panasonic Blu-ray machines unless an SD card in isnerted.  The horizontal thermometer fills in, showing that the movie is ready to go, and then everything stops.  Tried it again and again.  Returned the disk and got a new one.  Same problem.  So I checked online discussions and found that the fix is to insert an SD card.  I did, and viola!, there was the movie in beautiful HD.  I can find no explanation for why this is so.  I have no other Blu-ray diskd that have this problem.
0060900075|5.0|There are other books which clearly portray hallucinogenic madness (Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass) but there's no wisdom, only obscurity. In this book, Aldous Huxley skillfully presents himself as the patient explorer at the beginning, with many big-picture questions. In his descriptions of visuals and sensations, he includes countless references to artists, composers and poets. If you are not familiar with them, his comparisons become difficult to appreciate. Regardless, it's inspiring and Aldous is successful in transmitting those elusive epiphanies.
1594481717|5.0|I love this book by Daniel Pink -- his vision for a Creative future is spot on... It's an easy, enthusiastic read -- a very positive book.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy story 3 is a fine finish to the franchise a movie that tugs at every possible heartstring that exists, and adds just enough drama to make it unforgettable.    Andy is going off to college and it becomes D-Day for the toys, who will end up in the attic, who will be donated, who will be trashed and what lucky few will come with him?    There are several excellent scenes, and a few adult gags involving fashion.  The initial pre-school & \\"Latin lover\\" scenes are priceless.    My only complaint is this.  It was established in Toy Story 2 that Buzz is a very valuable toy.  I think that should have been a factor in what was going on.    On and the featurette Night and Day was absolutely fabulous.  It was in the best traditions of the cartoons of the 40's and 50's.  More of those please.
B003L45JLW|5.0|I recently listened 'Mojo' blu ray edition and it was musical heaven. I have an onkyo tx-5007 with 9.2 channels.<br />The cd is really nicely mixed and the surround is not overwhelming-too loud and nicely balanced. It is day and night when compared to the regular stereo version-which is also good. You can hear each and every instrument and hear alot of detail and clarity. The vocals are right on center and the guitars just surround you with warmth. I recommend every A/V enthusiast to purchase this disc right away-it is the best surround title that I own, so far.

0316017922|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell is in this book looking at the hidden patterns behind success. Since early 18th century there has been a cult of the 'genius', e.g. a believe that achievement in arts and sciences is linked to being a 'genius', some mythical quality which falls outside of normal experience and is something like a gift from the gods.  Gladwell does well in attacking the notion that genius is god given. He (to my understanding) does not dispute that some people for example have musical talent while others have not. But to become a superstar amongst thousands of musically gifted it also requires hard work. And hard work in its turn requires that you have a supportive family and a suitable material background - e.g. if you have to work all day on the farm you will not be able to spend much time on piano lessons.  And to some extent hard work and determination even trumps talent.   Yet first of all - is this really news? I remember learning that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.  Secondly - many of the examples he uses seem to be statistically irrelevant. For your career success it is obviously better to have an IQ of 120 rather than 70. Yet will someone with an IQ of 130 enjoy more success than someone with an IQ of 120? Not only can it be debated how meaningful IQ measurements above 120 really are, also, like in many other fields, there are some threshholds above which other factors start to count. With cars in F1, above a certain top speed to add more speed does not help, factors like agility etc. come into play. And his example regarding the influence of the date of birth on your success in sports - well, I checked the German National Soccer team. The players were born in the following quarters of the year: Q1: 4; Q2: 6; Q3: 6; Q4: 6. This is as even as it gets in statistics.  Then he even tries to link performance to culture. For example by linking the undeniable superiority of Asian high school students in certain fields to a culture of rice growing. First - why does he link it to rice growing rather than the many thousands of years of confucian tradition of learning? At least the latter would explain why students from North China (where no rice is grown) also outperform their peers in American highschools. And, as it seems, this way of learning seems to produce very few or no outliers, e.g. people who outperform their peers not by a few degrees but like a genius outperforms others. Though their might be other reasons (history, prejudice....) involved in explaining why there are so few East Asian Nobel Laureates.  Conveniently he also does not really discuss brilliant performers which did not have the favourable conditions which maybe a Bill Gates or The Beatles had. Why was Bobby Fischer a brilliant chess player long before he could have clocked the learning hours which Gladwell thinks neccessary for brilliance? And Fischer surely did not have the right background. Srinivasa Ramanujan had a reasonably well protected childhood, but how on earth could he, within one year of encountering formal mathematics, master more mathematics then a typical college student? And this at the age of 11.   So, summed up, this book is fun to read, it is an eye opener of some kind, but the author is far to much in love with his own prejudices and ideas to consider inconvenient facts.

0143118420|1.0|Cheap and boring writting, obviously people write and publish whatever they can, the readers made it a best seller(!)...this is the scary part of this book...millions have read and enjoyed(!)....does not worth the time, there are materpieces out there if one wants to go through a real journey! I am sorry this kind of literature becomes so popular.
B00005LOLD|5.0|Gee, this is a very moving film, and one of the few that I understood what in blazes Marlon way saying.  The acting is very believable and heart wrenching at times.  Regards Zy
0812973992|4.0|A novel of interlocking stories set in New York of the 1970s. Interweaving characters in this way (prostitutes, priests, a judge's wife, computer hackers) runs the risk of becoming ridiculous - it always feels false when someone attempts to create meaning out of piles of coincidences - but McCann largely succeeds. Most of the discrete sections feel complete, and the persistent reappearance of certain characters does not feel forced. This is a book that expands. It conveys the enormity of the world, while treasuring the human process of carving it into stories.    Some sections are stronger than others. In part this may be because McCann's writing style is surprisingly static from narrator to narrator, despite some curious cosmetic changes (sometimes speech is marked with quotation marks; sometimes not). He loves clipped, fragmentary, elusive sentences. He inhabits his characters without attempting to become them. Some come out more clearly than others. At worst, he can seem unconvincing and flat.     But the novel's momentum will carry the reader by its rough spots. Finishing it over the course of a day left me genuinely uplifted and touched. It is a sincere book that tries to speak to the world as it is. For McCann the possibility of beauty is an everyday thing, something to be earned through living, and the past is a curse that can recede. \\"Time doesn't cure everything, but it cures a lot.\\"
B002QBS9KE|5.0|This is by far the best bluetooth I have owned and the comfy ear tips make all the difference in  the world.    highly recommended.
0307592839|2.0|Normally a book this length takes me a couple days to read. I struggled with this book, picking it up, getting bored, annoyed or disgusted and then putting it down and walking away repeatedly for over a full week.<br />I couldn't find one character in this tale that I cared even the slightest about. They're all fairly well messed up, self absorbed, neurotic or otherwise damaged. Even the kids are annoying especially the one who wrote an entire (overly long!) chapter in a Power Point slide show which mostly discussed her brother's obsession with and the cataloging of rests/pauses in songs. While these people felt real, I've met several neurotics who matched quite well the quirks of the people in this book I just couldn't care about them.<br />Worst of all and one of my major pet peeves the narrative jumps around not only in time (we often have NO idea where in time we are during the story) it also jumps narrative styles. We go from an objective narrator to first person and in one chapter the story is being told TO the reader as if they're one of the characters in the book. I found it disjointed, convoluted, frustrating and very annoying.
0740745271|5.0|Great eye excersise, and left right brain balancing. Very interesting to be able to get the second focus and keep it for several seconds while looking around the picture. I think this and the others in the series are fab.    Regards Zy
0618918248|5.0|this book is superb. shows the pros and cos for each subject. the author definitely did his homework. will definitely increase your intellect
B00275EHJG|5.0|The moving tale of the toys we love being abandoned by their owner and then realizing they were wrong and trying to escape from a Stalag 17 style prison.  Themes of abandonment, growing up and moving on are rampant.  The secondary characters are particularly good and the voices remain the same (mostly) which I appreciate.  No, I didn't cry at the end, you wusses, and, even if I did, you have no evidence!  Heh.  MY GRADE: A minus.
0307473465|3.0|There is no need for me to rehash the plot given the number of reviews and the movie treatment which has alerted many to this story. What I will cover is its length as a novel (or novella) which provides a sparse and focused account. This was a redeeming factor for the book given the much trod ground it covers. The moral ambiguities presented by both characters are clinically interesting but I was never drawn in emotionally. The Reader is definitely a worthy effort but I was left thinking more of the deft twist in circumstances that led Hanna to her fate and the random choice of Michael to join her on part of her journey rather than the larger 'good versus evil' and atonement aspects the author intended.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|I'm really enjoying this album. The first time I popped it in my car I listened all the way through and was disappointed. I think there were just too many styles and sounds going on for me to wrap my head around. However, a second listening and I was getting more into each song. Now I've probably listened to the whole thing 15 times and am loving it! The whole album flows one song into the next despite there being so many different types of songs. I also know all Gorillaz older albums and I really do prefer this one overall to the others. Demon Days and this album are on the same level as far as my listening ears are concerned.
B003KT3NRA|4.0|After Vince Neil's last solo album, I wasn't expecting very much out of this. I was very surprised. A couple new songs which were very good and some remakes from other bands that sounded good also. I would recommend it to any Motley Crue or rock fans of that era.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Original, creative, and beautiful.  I don't want to say too much about the storyline, because part of the fun of watching this type of movie is not knowing what to expect.  If you enjoy action and thought-provoking ideas, you will probably like this movie.  If you are a parent trying to decide if this movie is okay for your kids, here are a few things you might want to be aware of; 1) there is a lot of violence - people being shot/shot at, hit by cars, stabbed, and other things people normally do when they are fighting 2) There is a lot of talk about and impressions of suicide (it makes sense in the story, but it's there nonetheless) 3) there are some very intense emotional scenes 4) there is some swearing 5) there are a few low-cut dresses.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Wow!  I've been looking out for Ms Monae since 2003 when she was giggin' around the Atlanta area and peddlin' her beautiful song, \\"It's Not Fair.\\"  She is sooooo amazingly gifted and has managed to take a bunch of different elements, internalize them and make them all her own.  This CD takes you on a voyage and as far as I'm concerned you can not like it but to hate it means you probably aren't a real music fan anyway.    The best way I can explain the LP is that it's Judy Garland meets Outkast, produced by Andrew Lloyd Weber, mixed by Gnarls Barkley and she most definitely pulled it off!  Its' quite amazing how she made an album that is very much 1920's/30's and 3014 at the same time.  Her album is like \\"1984\\" in motion!  I can't believe how great this album is!    The music on \\"Say You'll Go\\" is crazy good!  Faster is just wonderful and Cold War is the truth... I could go on and on forever; Janelle Monae has an absolutely beautiful voice!
0545123283|5.0|I know that whatever I say about this book is not going to covey what I really feel about it. It's impossible to put it into words. You may think that's silly but it's true. So I'm going to start off by repeating something I said in post awhile back: I rate a lot of books 5 stars. To me 5 stars means I loved it. It let me escape my everyday troubles and just have some fun for a bit. 5 stars means I cared about the characters and I would read the book over again, if I had time. But in light of just finishing Linger, I feel that I must clarify, there is a class higher than 5 stars. Only very very special books make it into this category.<br /><br />As you have already guessed Linger definitely makes it into this esteemed category. Linger was one of my most anticipated books of 2010. It made me do a happy dance in my PJ's in the middle of the road when I got it. Not many books make me do that. Scratch that, no books make me do that. So of course I started reading asap and I was not disappointed. From the very first page Maggie pulls you right back into the beautiful world she created in Shiver. Her writing is like nothing I have ever read before. It's beautiful and lyrical and maybe just a bit magical.<br /><br />In this book, like in Shiver the tension builds slowly throughout the book until you just can't stand it anymore! And then BAM! I need Forever NOW! These aren't action packed books but I think I like that better. They slowly draw you in until you realize that Sam and Grace are all you are thinking about and you just have to finish the book.<br /><br />Speaking of Sam and Grace....sigh. What a incredible romance! I love them. I love Sam....Their relationship was put to the test in this book and they still have some very big hurdles ahead of them. Did I mention I can't wait for Forever? They are the new YA it couple in my opinion. Maggie has created characters that you can't help but love and we get to meet some new ones in this book. Like Shiver, the point of view alternates between Sam and Grace, but in Linger we also get Isabell's POV and a new character Cole's. Cole is one of the new wolves and he's got a huge set of baggage. At first I wasn't happy about Cole taking my Sam time but I grew to really like him and his part in the story. I can't wait to see where Maggie takes his character. Isabell is a lot of fun. She has a lot of problems but she's snarky(aka bitchy) and it was fun to get to read more about her.<br /><br />These characters aren't just words on a page. Maggie brings them to life in a way that some authors only dream of. They get in your head and make their selves at home.<br /><br />Like I said before, whatever I say in this review will not do this book justice. You just have to read it yourself and experience it first hand. That's what this book is, an experience. That's what puts it in a class above the rest. I'm really proud of getting through this review with just saying OMG I loved it!!!! Because that's how it makes me feel. I hope you love it as much as I did.en Sam and Grace, but in Linger we also get Isabell's POV and a new character Cole's. Cole is one of the new wolves and he's got a huge set of baggage.

B003L16FAE|2.0|Predator is one of my favorite science fiction films, so I was eagerly anticipating the release of this film with digital remastering. However, my anticipaqtion is now total disappointment. The film is so over digitally restored that it does'nt that it look at all like the original film. Most scene's look unnatural and fake! Yes, I know movie's are fake, but if the special effects are done to make the experience realistic, as they were with this film, it now makes this version of the movie look extermely unrealistic. Save your money and wait for them to re-issue this disc the way it should have been or, if you already OWN THE PREVIOUS VERSION, STICK WITH IT.
B000VK6MNI|5.0|This is one of the best satire/comedies I have seen. One of the best scenes is the tobacco lobbyist versus the senator at a Senate hearing. One of the few movies I see more than once.

B002BWP4A6|5.0|On the one hand, this film is a very straightforward, realistic portrayal of life in a German village around the time of WWI. On the other hand, it's a mystery wrapped in an enigma. This isn't a movie for those who need pat solutions, clear explanations.    For one thing, the movie does not explain how the fascist evil of the holocaust might have developed. The narrator's early implication that the events in this village are a logical prelude to such subsequent horrors is misleading. The evil here is not the result of mass delusion, of raw mob mentality. It's a more subtle, more secret evil - the kind of evil that cripples behind closed doors. It's the work of some covert covenant. But who are the members of the covenant?    Again, early implications point to some of the village children as composing a secret society. Certain suggestions, certain shots remind us of \\"The Village of the Damned,\\" of \\"The Children of the Corn.\\" But if the children have formed some unholy alliance to commit the nasty crimes that plague the village - what caused them to coalesce into such wickedness? Are they wreaking a justifiable but sometimes misguided revenge for the sins of their fathers? Or are they bad seeds whose inherent evil was implanted by their parents?    Or are the children guilty at all? Could someone else be responsible? There's an odd shift in point of view in this film. It starts out as told by the town's schoolteacher, from the distance of his old age. In a crabbed voice-over, he uncertainly recalls the disturbing incidents. We let him guide us into those bygone days, our narrator, one of the few people who, along with his teenaged fiancé, seemed to have been innocent observers to what unfolded there. However, the film soon switches to the point of view of a ubiquitous observer, someone who is privy to the evil that men do in private. The schoolteacher couldn't have known about the cruelties underlying the public crimes. He couldn't have known about the perverse dominance exercised between parent and child, between master and mistress, unless...    Everything is so real and yet, at the same time, so surreal. So much is open to having double meaning. For example, in one especially intriguing shot in the chiaroscuro of this appropriately black-and-white film, we see the shabby, plaster-peeling interior of the home of one of the Baron's farm workers. The woman was recently killed in a harvesting accident, although even here, there's a question. Was it sheer accident, indifference, or murder? At any rate, the deceased is being waked in her own home, laid out on her own bed. But the camera's eye reveals the scene from a very odd angle. The viewer is frustrated in any attempt to see the whole scene. The edge of a door cuts off the heads of both grieving husband and dead wife from our view. All we see is the sharp, scythe-like arc of the husband's black coat as he leans over his wife's body. Is he praying over her - or preying over her?    This is brilliant, haunting film-making that ends up being as mysterious as the sources of cruelty itself.
0545123283|5.0|First of all... *sigh*. Second... Talk about guilty pleasure! And third... Well, if you thought you liked Sam, wait til you meet Cole... um, yeah, Sam who?<br /><br />I wish I could come up with enough praise to complement her writing. But I'm not Maggie, so if you want to find out how fantastically inspiring she writes you're gonna have to read her books. Look, seriously, she could write about aliens who become vampires but in fact are fallen angels, and I would loyally read without hesitation. And the fact that she writes about Cole just makes it all the better.<br /><br />If you read Shiver (which you should because this one cannot stand alone) you might be wondering what else could happen in Sam and Grace's dramatic existence. They meet Cole. Cole St. Clair is the hottest, most famous teen rock-star of the decade (drugs included) and was just bitten by Beck.<br /><br />This time the story alternates between four points of view: Sam, Grace, Isabel and Cole, which was a little confusing but really enjoyable. It allows the reader to get to know these new characters thus becoming main parts of the story. While Grace and Sam are somewhat plain and boring characters (I love them, but they are), Isabel and Cole are the spark or the malice that was necessary for this book to be interesting. While I did love Shiver I knew that if she wanted to keep her slow poetic pace she needed someone like Isabel to step up and inject some fun into it. It totally worked, and even though the story lacked action and the pace was slow, the character development and again, the writing, kept me involved the whole time. I highly recommend this series.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful sequel to a wonderful book. I cannot wait for the next one!
7885221660|3.0|Missing note on product description that the video is in DVD-9 format.  Not all DVD players can play those type (DVD-9).  That usually indicates that two discs were copied onto one disc (DVD9)- Asian movie format, or bootleg.  That latter may not be likely though but cannot be ruled out.  Asian Video was very responsive to my concerns and quickly provided a full refund not long after I returned/shipped back the movie to them.

0140143505|5.0|This book (which was later made into a good movie with Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft)is set in the post World War II era.  For us boomers, we thought that everything came back to normal quickly after the war, but this story shares some of the ongoing hardships encountered by Europeans during the next decade of rebuilding.  Shortages of certain every day foods, stockings and what we think of every day items were evident.<br /><br />The story of an American woman who is always searching for certain old book classics and the staff of a small English independent book shop is detailed, interesting and at times moving.  As time moves along, two of the principal characters continue to communicate by letter but they never meet.  I don't want to give away the ending, but this is a story on networking and people caring in times past.  Well done!<br /><br />John Hogan<br /><br />HoganHospitality<br />HospitalityEducators
B0015DROBO|5.0|Teenagers-this review is for you.<br /><br />I'm 14 (and a girl FYI) and i realy enjoyed the storyline of the book and how it ended and the characters and all that stuff so I gave it a 5.<br /><br />HOWEVER at the begining there are some sort of business talk with firms and stocks and junk and its so confusing my only advice is to take the gist of it and move on (because honestly the world wont end if you skip that part). ALSO there are a lot of explicit scenes and sexual references and if my parents knew i read this they would lock me up in a cage. So i would leave this one to the 15/16+ year olds. I wish someone had warned me about that part BEFORE i started the book and i was like whoa there...But I'm still gonna read the rest of the books hehe:P It's definitley worth all that reading and suspense can be felt throughout.<br />Look for my review on the second book coming soon!!!
0879309210|4.0|I bought this book to help aid me in setting up my guitars and it helped.  I have a problem with Dan saying one thing and saying another in a different chapter.  He will teach one thing but sell another.  All and all the book is a great reference guide.  If I had to I would buy the product again!
B003OCWF6I|3.0|There are enough 4 star reviews here to label this as better than the typical action film, which it is, but being a fan of the comics, I do have some points of contention.    The Good:    It's really fun to see these characters brought to life from the books; the whole cast is great. I think the movie does a better job with the character of Roque as opposed to his role in the books. Lots of the great panels from the comics are rendered quite faithfully here; actual panel art from the comics is interspersed into the intro and credits as well. I really liked that.    The Bad:    Condensing the 500+ page story into an hour and a half just doesn't work; the movie deserved a longer running time. Movie starts really strong, but the villain/Max character just doesn't work with what is presented here. (SPOILER) Aisha's conflict with Clay is reduced to about 4 sentences of dialog in this movie, whereas you get to actually see what she is \\"unhappy\\" about in the books and that's significant.    I wasn't that impressed with the picture quality here for a blu-ray release; but at $20, which includes an additional DVD and digital download, I'm not unhappy with the purchase.    The extra with Andy Diggle and Jock, author and artist of the comics, were also a must see, in my opinion, for fans of the comics.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I have been using these sony head phones for 5-10 years and love them.  I am happy to see them on Amazon, the only other place I know that sells them is Target, for the same price (about $10).  I use them for running 3-4 times a week.  Throughout the years, I have tried other kinds, earbuds, the kind that wrap behind the ears, but these are the only headphones that stay on my ears when I run.  My only complaint is that I wish they were more durable, I have to replace mine every 3-4 months because one of the ears goes out.  I would pay more for a more durable pair.  But for the price, you can't beat them!  If you intend to be a heavy user, I would recommend having an extra pair on hand.  There is nothing worse than struggling through a workout and one side goes out!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is a great way to get introduced to a great show like Breaking Bad.  Season 1 is only 7 episodes but a lot happens and you'll be hooked after the opening intro for episode 1.  Also, lots of extra goodies on here that make the DVD purchase well worth it.
B00337KM2S|4.0|A perfect story of the high-flying life led by Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) who is a corporate hatchet man, responsible for making sure that employee terminations go nice and smoothly. For all the brutality of his role, Bingham has found a way to give fired workers the dignity they need to leave their old, familiar jobs. For this talent, he is highly prized...and compensated. His lofty lifestyle is laid out wonderfully - he wears the finest suits, he knows the best restaurants, hotels and credit cards, and commands the best service. When, on one of his trips, he meets Vera Farmiga (Alex Goran) whose passion and knowledge of the good life matches his own, it seems like a match made in the heavens.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about \\"Up in the Air\\" is that it doesn't follow any of the clich&eacute;d plotlines that could have emerge from this situation. For one thing, Clooney is saddled with a rcent business school grad who wants to replace him with a computerized script. The tension between technologized youth and wisdom and humanity is priceless and timely. It's hard to discuss the movie without giving the story away. Suffice it to say that nothing is what it seems, and turbulence is a certainty. A very fine film that plays to Clooney's roguish persona, \\"Up in the Air\\" is full of humor, wit, high passion, a glimpse in to the high life and genuine pathos.

0788812408|5.0|I have always stayed away from Disney princess movies, and a major reason is because I worried about being teased. So I finally decided to watch the Little Mermaid last year, and I enjoyed it immensely. Through the next week I had watched it four times when I started to realize this is one of my favorite movies. If you shy away from Disney movies, I would still recommend this one, while yet this is your typical Disney love story, it's still a great movie. I first noticed how amazing the animation was in the Little Mermaid, the animation was a big improvement over most of the movies Disney made in the 70's and 80's. The waves during the final scene are incredible for being animated and all those hand drawn bubbles in the underwater scenes must have taken forever to master. The Little Mermaid also has one of the best scores for a Disney movie and the credit goes to the talented Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. And while yet I was embarrassed to admit liking the Little Mermaid, isn't this what makes a movie great, fun characters, great animation, an incredible score and an enjoyable plot. So I will admit, while yet I may be too old to be watching a Disney princess movie I don't care.<br /><br />If you own the Little Mermaid on VHS from the \\"Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection\\", I would recommend keeping it. Jodi Benson (the voice of Ariel) introduces the trailers for the upcoming projects Walt Disney studios are working on and if you're a Little Mermaid completes' this tape is a nice item to keep. There also is a \\"Part of Your World\\" music video with Jodi Benson during the end credits, which I don't believe is included with the two disc special edition.<br /><br />I unfortunately love this movie now and I'm going to have to explain this to other people but it's a price I have to pay. A great movie should be intended for all audiences so I would recommend watching the Little Mermaid.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|For some reason or another, I missed seeing \\"Avatar\\" in the theater and then never saw it until just last night after it came out on DVD.  With all the hype about the special effects and the hundreds of millions of dollars this film grossed at the box office, I knew my wife and I had to at least jump on the bandwagon and see what all the hype was about.  And lemme tell you, this movie did not disappoint.  From the very beginning, you knew this film was different with the vibrant colors and newfound cinematography that James Cameron used to weave this storyline together.  Sure, it's a theme we've seen and heard before, but who cares?!  You can't help but enjoy all the eye candy in that make this film worth watching over and over again.  I'm super-impressed with the quality of \\"Avatar\\" and would not be surprised to see a sequel.
0307245306|4.0|I listened to the audio CD of this book and enjoyed most of it. The narration was generally very good, except for a few of the voices the guy used, which were downright painful to listen to. (recalls Zeus's voice, shudders at memory)<br /><br />The story itself is generally a fun fantasy. I think other people thoroughly covered the entire ocean's worth of Harry Potter similarities. For those wondering, Percy Jackson is no Harry Potter (in my opinion, HP is a better series), but his life pretty much mirrors the boy wizard's. He's got a brainiac, sometime antagonistic female friend and a bumbling, loyal, brave guy friend. He's a kid thrust into an adventure because of who he is, specifically son of the sea god.<br /><br />What follows is a tale of one misadventure after another as the three friends go on their epic journey to stave off a 3-way war of the ancient Greek gods.<br /><br />Good thing: It piques one's interest in reading up on Greek mythology.<br />Blah thing: The ending seems very much contrived. It's like the author was very anxious to tie things up so neatly that he decides a royal infodumping session is necessary. (That means 2 characters stand there discussing the whole story just in case you hadn't read the rest of the book.)
0316548189|5.0|I've always had a great admiration for Nelson Mandela, but have only known the very basics about his life and political career. Whenever I saw him on TV I was always captivated by the man who had ruled a nation, yet seemed so grounded and modest that I could only respect him. I have to admit that up to the point of reading this book I was totally ignorant to the extremities of apartheid in South Africa for which Mr. Mandela had given his entire life to beating. I have now read these wonderful memoirs in their entirety and must say my admiration and respect for the man has increased to a level I genuinely cannot describe. Having an interest in history, this was undoubtedly a book that I had to read at some point, but up until this point I had, in my mind, placed the struggle against apartheid along the same lines as the civil rights movement in the United States; but I have now come to realise that, although there are similarities, there are a lot more differences.<br /><br />One of the most glaring differences between the two, which Mr. Mandela touched upon in his memoirs, was that in the United States the black population were guaranteed equal rights through their constitution but simply had these taken away from them by the racist political elites, whereas in South Africa, there was legislation and laws forbidding equality to the black majority of the country and this helps distinguish very clearly the route Mr. Mandela had to take in beating apartheid. I'm not going to say much about the story itself as it's one to be read and enjoyed first hand, but I will give my impressions on Mr. Mandela which were gained purely from reading his memoirs. I gained the impression that he has always been aware he's not perfect, nor is he one that thinks he's always right. He is a man that shows respect to every person he meets, but he won't shy away from an argument or a battle when he is attacked either verbally or physically. He's a man of reflection and integrity; he will look back on a past decision and say honestly whether it was the right or wrong call of the time. He's a man who has a lot of love and respect for all of his family, political friends and his country. He has given all of his life in the pursuit of freedom for his country, and he deserves out respect for that.<br /><br />He has a remarkable story to tell and it would be a shame if anyone who read this review or at some point had seen this book whilst browsing and skipped past it without even considering what they could learn. I've now an enormous appreciation for the fight which Mr. Mandela put up against the immense oppression of the South African government; and perhaps it has a greater message to send. The message we can all take from this is that, no matter how big the government or how powerful the oppression, the strength of human will and desire can truly overcome any obstacle thrown at it. Mr. Mandela also expresses a very strong message about there being goodness in all of us, no matter how much we try to hide it. He shows compassion towards those who were once his enemies as he realises that they are all good people at heart, and it is him and those like him that must teach those in the world whose job it is to hate, exactly how much better it is to love your enemy.<br /><br />Beautiful life story of a beautiful man. You must own this book.on a past decision and say honestly whether it was the right or wrong call of the time. He's a man who has a lot of love and respect for all of his family, political friends and his country. He has given all of his life in the pursuit of freedom for his country, and he deserves out respect for that.     He has a remarkable story to tell and it would be a shame if anyone who read this review or at some point had seen this book whilst browsing and skipped past it without even considering what they could learn. I've now an enormous appreciation for the fight which Mr. Mandela put up against the immense oppression of the South African government; and perhaps it has a greater message to send. The message we can all take from this is that, no matter how big the government or how powerful the oppression, the strength of human will and desire can truly overcome any obstacle thrown at it. Mr. Mandela also expresses a very strong message about there being goodness in all of us, no matter how much we try to hide it. He shows compassion towards those who were once his enemies as he realises that they are all good people at heart, and it is him and those like him that must teach those in the world whose job it is to hate, exactly how much better it is to love your enemy.     Beautiful life story of a beautiful man. You must own this book.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|This movie got some very harsh critiques but it's a fun movie. Downey and Law are great. The movie has interesting plot twists and good flow.  It's not amazingly memorable but it's worth checking out.
B0012GMUZY|1.0|Mississippi John Hurt was an amazing folk musician and these are some of his finest recordings. It's too bad that Columbia decided to use sonic solutions \\"no noise\\" processing on this release. Thankfully a much better release of the same material is available from Yazoo titled: The 1928 Sessions. The difference is between the two releases is so extreme it staggers the imagination how Columbia could have released this cd sounding so poorly.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|I read all the reviews and watched the video. I bought this for my new iphone4. The installation looked good for a week, but then started to come up on the edges.  I registered the product and tried to get a replacement, but they were going to charge me an additional $24.99 because it was ineligible (Reason: I bought it from Amazon instead of Zagg directly).  BUYER BEWARE!
030745455X|5.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire is the second installment in the Millenium series of crime novels by the late great<br />Stieg Larsson (1954-2004). Larsson was Swedish. He had hoped to write 10 novels in the series. He left us all too soon.<br /> This novel of over 600 pages continues the story of the anorexic 4'11' inch tall Lisebeth Salander. Lisbeth is one of the most fascinating characters I have encountered in crime fiction. In this novel she is forced to revisit her horrible past as she confronts family members who threaten her life. Lisbeth is now fabulously wealthy due to her stealing of millions of kroner throgh the use of her unsurpassed computer hacking skills. She is bisexual; one of her female lovers is almost murdered due to her connection with Lisbeth.<br />  Blomkvist and his friends at the Millenium periodical are investigatiing the murder of a young journalist and his doctoral candidate girlfirend who were doing research on young girls from Russia being used for sex trafficing in Sweden. Their work is called \\"From Russia With Love. Lisbeth had visited the couple in their apartment on the night they were shot.<br />  Lisbeth becomes a suspect in the murder when her fingerprints are found on the gun found at the scene of the crime. Her evil guardian is also found murdered. Did she commit triple murder or is she innocent?Blomkvist who has not seen Lisbeth, his former lover, in over a year is determined to find out the secrets and prove Lisbeth's innocence. There are many scenes of graphic violence described before the case is solved.<br />  The plot is not as complicated or as intriguing as was the family saga of the wealthy Vanger family in \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\" The book can read slowly though the characters are well drawn and the writing is superb.<br />A good not a great novel but well worthy of your time and money. Larsson has become an international publishing success. It is a shame he did not live to see it.
B000EQHHJW|4.0|Yes, the acting of Regoletto shines all the way through this film/opera. The filming is also good in terms of at 80's. Pavarotti truly showed his 'golden' voice in this production. Worth to watch it.<br /><br />Only one thing I am not perfectly satisfied which is the recording. The orchestra sound isn't the best, especially at the loudest parts. I think maybe the recording engineering didn't set the 'peak' volume right. (maybe I am wrong, no offense here)
B000YJ85BI|4.0|This was a satisfying third book in the series, and I certainly enjoyed it.  A good story set in a very interesting universe but it was a little bit too political for my liking compared to more of the action of the first two books.  Overall, a good read but slightly below the others.
B001Q06BB0|3.0|This product arrived in the same condition as business described and promptly. The only reason they do not get 5 stars is because of shipping. I paid $2.95 for shipping and it arrived with a $1.35 worth of shipping paid for. I would have been okay with this except I owed the USPS money for the shipping.
B001CSQIMI|5.0|I've loved this album for years. I just never replaced it when I switched from LP to CD. Pat shows he's the man on this album. Lots of great acoustic guitar songs. If your a Metheny Fan this is for you!
B002ZG9846|5.0|I'm a big fan of superhero movies. I loved the Chris Nolan Batman films, [[ASIN:B001FB55H6 The Watchmen]], Iron Man, and the first 2 Spider-man films, but I didn't know anything about Kick-Ass when it came out in theaters. Only one of my friends had seen it, and I didn't hear any buzz about this film except the mainstream press criticizing it for its gratuitous violence. I was turned off by the ugly poster art and poor marketing, thinking it was some cheesy knock-off of the Watchmen.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. Having just watched it, I can definitely say it's one of my favorite films of 2010. It's an entertaining and suspenseful action movie with lots of guns and tons of violence. It's an anti-hero movie. The main character, Dave, sucks at being a superhero. He's just an ordinary high school kid with a dumb green costume made out of a wetsuit he bought online. The only thing he has going is an extraordinary ability to get his ass beaten on a regular basis because of his gross lack of fighting skills. A third of the way into the film, he is saved from certain death by two real superheroes, Big Daddy and Hit Girl and their story arcs converge. Big Daddy (who dresses like Batman/Night Owl) and Hit Girl are father and daughter, two highly-skilled vigilantes out to settle a personal score with drug kingpin Frank D'Amico. Nick Cage, who I'm not normally fond of, I liked in this film as Big Daddy. 13 year old Chloe Moretz plays Hit Girl. She is both adorable and deadly. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is as annoying as ever.<br /><br />Visually, Kick-Ass is superb. It's stylish and super-violent in the same way that the Watchmen was violent and stylish (but not nearly as violent as [[ASIN:B0035V35PI Ninja Assasin]]). Lots of people die in fancy, inventively-choreographed and cleverly shot ways. There's a ridiculously over-the-top John Woo-styled clip reloading/gun catching sequence and a mini-gun/jet-pack at the end, but it's all in good fun. Gun geeks will also drool over all the hardware hanging in Big Daddy's safe room and the SMAW (shoulder-launched rocket). Lots of blood. Lots of stabbings. One guy even gets blown up in a microwave. If you don't like violence, stay far away from this movie.<br /><br />Story-wise, Kick-Ass shares many similarities with the Nolan Batman films, The Watchmen, Spider-man, and [[ASIN:B002O5M4SA L&eacute;on: The Professional]] in that the heroes are human and fallible. The film takes place in Brooklyn and other parts of New York City, but it's quite obvious from the locations that it was shot elsewhere (Toronto, Canada) for budgetary reasons.<br /><br />If you enjoyed any of the films I've mentioned in this review, you'll probably enjoy Kick-Ass too.nging in Big Daddy's safe room and the SMAW (shoulder-launched rocket).

B002ZG980U|1.0|I went to see Inception in the theater, and for the second time in my life experienced the feeling of desperately wanting to get up and walk out so as to salvage at least part of the evening.  Had I been sitting on the aisle I certainly would have.  As it was, there was no choice but to sit through the whole excruciating thing, hoping beyond hope that it would end and put me out of my misery.<br /><br />I know others have rated the movie highly, and I respect their opinions.  At the end of the screening I went to, many of the folks leaving seemed to have really enjoyed it.  Personally, though, I think it was just awful, for three reasons: the stakes, the villains, and the writing.<br /><br />Comparison with The Matrix series is inevitable, because here - like in The Matrix- we have action taking place in the \\"real\\" world and a \\"dream\\" world.  Inception takes the Matrix-like concept and adds to it with multiple dream worlds, and dream worlds within dream worlds.  That idea has the potential to be interesting, so due credit there.  The first problem, though, is that the stakes in Inception are too low.  In The Matrix, success in the dream world means saving all of humanity from enslavement.  OK, that's a goal I can get invested in.  Here, success in the dream world means two things: a) the Leo DiCaprio character gets to see his kids, and b) one big energy corporation gets an advantage in the market over another big energy corporation.  Ho hum.  (Now, don't get me wrong - it's possible to make a movie where the audience gets invested in a father-child relationship, and an emotional journey comes to have high stakes.  To do that, though, the movie has to work to develop the emotional elements of the characters and the story, which Inception doesn't do.  There's so much sci-fi gimmickry, action, and special effects that there's no room left to develop a human story worth caring about.)<br /><br />Well, if it's not a success as a deep character study, at least it can be a good sci-fi action thriller, right?  Well, there's more hope here, but still it didn't work for me.  Here the problem is the villains.  There aren't any.  Yes, Our Heroes do a lot of fighting, but it's against random faceless gunmen who pop up and get shot down like in a videogame.  Again, compare to The Matrix: the scenes with Agent Smith talking to Morpheus, and later to Neo, give us a bad guy we can really root against, which makes the good guy more fun to root for.  Or in Die Hard, when Hans Gruber kills  the smarmy guy without qualm, it makes Hans more evil and makes it more cathartic when he loses at the end.  There isn't even a betrayal twist where one of our favorite characters turns out to be the bad guy.  Of course, the conflict here is not man-vs-man or man-vs-nature, it is man-vs-himself; but as already noted above, that takes attention to character that wasn't paid here.<br /><br />Finally, the writing.  There's just nothing quotable in Inception.  The closest thing to a quotable line was \\"well it was worth a try\\" - not going to become anyone's catch phrase.  No \\"there is no spoon.\\"  No \\"I know kung fu!\\"  No \\"I'll be back.\\"<br /><br />At the end of the day, Inception tries to mix an action flick with an emotional journey, and succeeds at neither.  I'd say save your time and your money, and give this one a miss.ller, right?  Well, there's more hope here, but still it didn't work for me.  Here the problem is the villains.  There aren't any.

B001OQCV2O|1.0|This movie is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made .It is so ridiculous and implausible. Its even so bad that its not even one of those movies that is so bad that you enjoy it anyway. Its worse than that. Its two hours of my life that I'll never get back......... Don't just avoid this movie RUN AWAY SCREAMING.....
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I love this series! I was really young while it was still running on TV, and I can remember watching it with my mom and sister. I did not see all of the seasons when I bought this. I recently saw reruns on and wanted to have them all, and see what I missed many years ago. The show itself is great; the characters, costume, and topics are all of good entertainment value, and a pleasure to watch. I'm very glad I got this; great to watch and enjoy with family, just like mine did when the show aired on TV.
B002VHI8FE|3.0|I liked the story line, and the characters, but found the writing style very, verbose.  This book really needed to be edited.  Lots of long descriptions that added nothing to the story for me.  Even the fight scenes left the heros with time for introspection, during the fighting!  I may read the sequel in the hope that it moves faster.  I found myself skimming whole paragraphs to get some movement into the story.  Much more human interest and self doubt than action.
B000I0QM04|1.0|I was reminded of this movie after a discussion on most disappointing movies you have ever seen.     Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is one of the few movies I have ever had to turn off with in the first 25 minutes because it was so painful to watch. The dialogue is beyond horrible and the acting is even worse, (which has to be the fault of the director, because many of the actors in this flick have shown elsewhere that they can act).    Now, realize, that I am a Sci-fi fan and will often watch even some very low budget stuff, if it can provide at least some hook to overcome it's shortcomings. I've also enjoyed other movies with a very retro 50's style delivery, overdone special effects, etc... So, no negative bias towards the genre or the concept; I just found this movie to be as grating as fingernails on a chalkboard.    Another reviewer said it was better to watch this one with the sound off, because the dialogue was so bad. To bad I hadn't thought of that, maybe I could have given a more in depth review of the movie and possibly have found something positive to say about the visuals. (For the record though, the blurry soft focus evident in the bit of the movie I was able to get through was almost as annoying as the dialogue)!    Everyone is different. Some people gave this thing positive reviews, so maybe you'll like it too. However, just be warned that if you have never seen this movie before and still feel you want to give it a shot, you might want to rent it before deciding if it's worth a purchase!
0061122092|1.0|A reader living in the first century B.C.E. might be excused for five-starring this novel, which ignores seminal knowledge humans have gained in the past two thousand years. It's selling the most absurd Ol' Time religious brew, laced with concepts like destiny and magical cures that are an insult to anyone at all familiar with 20th century physics, to anyone with a clue to a contemporary vision of this creation of billions of galaxies and multiverses in which we are embedded. I can weep -- either sitting or standing -- contemplating all the willfully ignorant people who consider this inspirational. It's the worst novel I've read in half a century, but then, it's the only Coelho novel I've ever read.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have to say.. I didn't buy it on Amazon, but I love the watch, and was very hesitant before I finally pulled the trigger. So I'm writing this to help the potential owners of the watch who are in the place where I once was.     The 1st impression of the watch was.. a lot better than it looks in pictures online. Even though it's considered as a cheap watch, it looks a lot more expensive than its price.. It's a solid, handsome looking watch. And I really don't think the manufacturer's picture here does the watch justice.     Its size is at around 37mm. This is def. not a big watch.. and on a small side for nowadays where huge faced watches are the norm.. Well, I have a thin wrist (at 6.5) and prefer the look of a small watch for its understated look. This works perfect for me.     The accuracy of the watch (of mine anyway) seems to be very good. For the past four days, it only ran two seconds faster. That's an exceptional performance for an entry level automatic watch under $100.    I had many models on mind before I made this purchase. While I'm still planing on getting some of the candidates in the future, I'm really glad that I picked this one first for my everyday watch. Chances are.. you will be too.    *I got mine on a metal band since I didn't think I'd like the nylon strap on this one very much. (I see Amazon carries it at an extra cost.) Oh and the lume, in case it matters to you, is a OK.

B003ELOQD4|5.0|I pretty much own every U2 video that there is out there, and the Rose Bowl is the best one of their concert videos of all time. The production is great, the bonus features are great, the editing is great. Here's how I would rank 'em: Rose Bowl #1, ZOO TV from Sydney #2, Elevation 2001 from Boston #3, Vertigo 2005 from Chicago #4, and Under a Blood Red Sky from Red Rocks #5. Popmart from Mexico City would get an honorable mention.

0757302661|5.0|I had my second baby using this book. AMAZING! I birth naturally it happened quickly and there was not very much pain. I even used the guidelines in the book to make my own video of flowers opening up with all of the affirmations to watch before and during labor.    I wrote all the affirmations on papers and had them posted inside cupboards, on bathroom mirrors on the computer screen... That way I would read them everyday. I also listened to the tape starting at around 32 weeks about three times a week.    The book in and of itself is not helpful, it is only helpful if you put the ideas into practice.    For me I am also a christian and did not know about the scripture in the Bible that talks about a curse and women will have pain during child birth. Not only in this book, but in another old book it goes into great detail about that particular scripture and takes it back to the original Hebrew, I found it enlighting, and life changing on so many levels.    My birth went incredibly well, and was fast and only about 25 minutes or less of the intense stuff. I can honestly say there was more pain and discomfort after the birth because the doctor had to stitch me up.    I highly recommend this book, but would caution that it is in changing your mind set on what you think is appropriate during birth that the material in this book can be helpful. If you think that child birth must be painful then it will be. You have to really take a look inside and see the areas you have been tweaked by society to believe and change that mind set.    Birth summary: I was a week over due, induced using a tiny pill he put by or in the cervix at 1:00 pm. Did lots of walking .. very few to no contractions that could be felt. doctor came in at 8 pm examined me said i was 5 cm and he broke my waters (which did not hurt at all), I was feeling crampy around 9pm had to run to the toilet a few times. By 9:30 I felt contraction, but very tolerable, easy to go into the relaxed state and breath through them, then at 10:00 I told my husband to get the nurse baby was coming, shortly after the head was out, by 11:00 I and baby were resting in bed and nursing for the night. I did no pushing and allowed my body to do it for me. No one was ready and my husband was running around helping, I did not even have my underwear off yet:) the doctor came in as the head was out I think. Great birth--I loved it.
1427200874|5.0|Sophie's World is a terrific way to introduce the reader to the novice's view of philosophy.  Reviewing great philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Marx and Camus this enjoyable novel unravels the thoughts of the world's great minds to the layperson.  A unique point of view is used in this work which relates the events of the story through a fictional character's point of view: glimpsing the human world as the story unfolds before her.  Take it from me, this experience will stay with you long after you put this book down or finish listening to the audio version.
0385334206|5.0|anything Kurt has ever written is amazing  my summer going into senior year of high school my summer professor turned me onto him with Cats Cradle. Breakfast of Champions, or Goodbye Blue Monday, far surpasses that novel.
0547258305|5.0|Graceling is an amazing story of Katsa, a warrior-girl in her late teens with one blue eye and one green eye. Her looks is one of Gracelings, who are gifted with individual skills.  Katsa's Grace is the ability to fight and kill, which is used for her manipulative king.  Forced to act as a henchman, Katsa is guilt-ridden and forms a secret council to bring justice.  A strong heroine who follows her heart as well as her mind, Katsa's tale is filled with action, adventure, fantasy and romance.  I recommend this book for more mature teens because of some elements dealing with sexuality and marriage.  While Katsa is a strong woman, she is also flawed, and it is these flaws that makes her more interesting.
0385504225|5.0|I listened to Lost Symbol on unabridged audio CD, narrated by Paul Michael.  I understand many criticisms cited by other readers - formulaic, sometimes contrived, Robert Langdon \\"not believing his eyes\\"...etc.<br /><br />These critiques are valid, but this audio book leaped off the page for me.  I listen to a lot of audio books commuting to work, and I've never heard narrator Paul Michael.  He's terrific, with a strong vocal tone that works well for male and female characters, and skill creating emotion and tension.  Also good with accents and different vocal styles for different characters.<br /><br />Paul Michael's effectiveness brings out the best in Lost Symbol - the breakneck plot, and mysteries surrounding the symbols, for example.  He successfully downplays the cheesy elements of the story by not imbuing them with too much sentimentality or unfounded build-up.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, I really enjoyed the historical context about the Freemasons, and the symbol and word puzzles we're used to with Robert Langdon.<br /><br />All-in-all, a very fun audio book that I think will keep you listening in your car after arriving at your destination.
1597801585|5.0|I am one of the `Malayan Chinese' as depicted in this novel, and I am simply astonished at how real and accurate Bacigalala's grasp and hold of the socio-political undertones of Thailand and the Malaysian Chinese are in this novel. Many times I find myself flipping to the front to check the author's name to see if he really isn't Asian and then to the tiny write-up of himself to see if he lived in Asia for decades. Iowa born. Hmmm.....    Lot's of great dystopian lit out there, but this one really hit home for me simply because of its Asian setting. Could actually picture dystopian Bangkok all around me as I read this book.     Ok constructive rascist views aside, this book is one of the best pieces of science fiction I have ever read, my other favorite being Dune (by the original  Frank Herbert). I'm usually not one to pounce on new unheard of authors, but I came onto this having just finished Bagicalalala's YA novel Ship Breaker which blew me away (and is not in an Asian setting but in the Gulf of Mexico). I started the book with the presumption that this was no way going to be better than Ship Breaker. But the book proved me wrong 15 minutes in. An exciting, thrilling, dystopic  romp to the finish. I am hungry for more Bacgialala now.      Why the hell is it taking till December for paperbacks of Pump Six (his short story collection) to be released?!??!!!!  I simply can't afford the hardcover versions going for $400 over at the moment!!!!    Congratulations for being my new number one author farang Paolo. Hurry up  and show us what else is in your imagination.
B003LD9P4K|5.0|If you are fond of ELP'ers music, you will love this title. Yes, 1970 is long gone, so you naysayers really need to get over it!     Performace = 5 stars, AQ/VQ = 5 stars. After watching this, I think Keith Emerson may be a better keyboard player than John Lord. Of course, we all know Lord ruled on keyboard, no.    Great performances get played more than once or twice - this one is gonna get spun quite a few times.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Salt is not what you would call a masterpiece, or even on the same level as the similar Bourne films, but thanks to Angelina Jolie, it's just entertaining enough. She carries this movie on her skinny shoulders. What's up with her lack of weight? She looked great back in the Tomb Raider days, now she looks like a twig. I guess she's still a little sexy, but that's mainly due to her on-screen presence and butt kicking attitude. She and Milla Jovovich don't really look the part at first glance, but both have become the two main female action stars on the planet. The only difference being that Jolie has a much wider range with her acting talent.<br /><br />The plot and writing are decent, but the whole Russia vs. the U.S. thing has been old for decades. There are a couple of neat twists along the way and early on you're not quite sure if Jolie's character is good or bad, so that keeps things interesting. I thought the storyline with her husband needed to be expanded upon, especially since his character is vital in changing the mindset of an important individual. The action scenes are well shot and violent for PG-13, with Jolie taking out countless armed guards with ease. Her acting ability and body control makes it all the more believable. You also get a lot of real stunts and very little CGI, which is always welcomed.<br /><br />Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor (dude needs a harder name to pronounce) are the only other main characters. They are both okay, but only a certain one gets to shine a bit more towards the end.<br /><br />Salt leaves room for a sequel or two. I read that this movie was originally written for Tom Cruise, so with the writing geared toward Angelina Jolie in future installments, I think they can be even better.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B00361AASW|5.0|I did not realize a lot of the ins and outs of the fashion world before this movie. The movie reveals the dichotomy of the depths and shallowness of this business. Even if it is only about clothes, it is also about peoples lives.
0596522347|4.0|If you're an \\"Al Gore level\\" presenter assigned to knock your audience dead with an elaborate slide presentation, complete with all the bells and whistles imaginable; this book is definitely for you.<br /><br />Nancy Duarte's highly informative, step-by-step guide to producing and executing elaborate slide presentations is extremely powerful; perhaps too powerful for most applications.  For the typical, slightly informal, \\"quick and simple strategy\\", this book, which is about 270 pages, is probably 200 pages too long.  There's a lot of material in here; no doubt, but for most practical purposes, there's a lot of \\"skimming\\" to be done, to cut to the chase.  That's not really a problem, I suppose.  After all, it's better to have access to all this information, to be prepared for something really collosal in scope and importance.  The earlier reference to Al Gore is my tongue in cheek observation to the book's likely amount of overkill.  For the vast majority of presentations - slide or otherwise - a much simpler approach is advisable.<br /><br />However, this book is beautifully crafted with remarkable attention to detail and visual impact.  It may be more than anyone will ever need to prepare for any possible presentation imaginable, so this may wind up on more coffee tables than conference tables throughout corporate America.  That's not necessarily such a bad thing, unless the struggling business is operating on tight margins, where every penny spent has to be relentlessly scrutinized.  In that case, they may need to leave this tome alone.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|You'll follow the story line best if you are reading the book series. It fills in all the mythology characters and explains the importance. It isn't 100% true to the book, most movies are not. This is a great movie for a family pizza/movie night.

Recomendo que não só assistam à este filme, mas que também incluam ele na sua coleção de Blu Ray, assim como eu.  É um suspense que prende a sua atenção do começo ao fim, é muito inteligente, envolvente e que conta com a interpretação de ótimos atores além do DiCaprio!    5 stars!!    Valeu Amazon!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This is a great miniseries.  It is very seductive, sexual, and dramatic.  The acting is first rate and the series is visually stunning.  This miniseries isn't for the faint of heart.  It is for adults and you will get a sense of what Roman life was like.  It isn't pretty.  The story takes a lot of liberties with history, but you will get a felling of what Julius Caesar and Marc Antony may have went through over 2000 year ago.  You follow 2 soldiers throughout the series and how they witness history in the making.  This miniseries is never boring and you will enjoy each episode.  I found the story and writing better than the Soprano's.  At least the ending is satisfying.   Highly recommend this series for your collection.

B00337KM2S|5.0|Ryan Bingham makes his living going from one city to another laying off people so the bosses won't do it themselves. Ryan gets comfort from the routine he sets his life to and the way he convinces himself that he is fulfilled, until he meets Natalie.  Natalie is a motivated young lady who is trying to reduce the cost of sending people like Ryan to fire employees. Once Ryan's job is threatened by Natalie's idea, he agrees on taking her with him on a trip to show her how important his job is.<br /><br />The story might sound very simple and plain, but on their way, Ryan and Natalie develop a friendship that will change the way they see life and relationships. Both friends find out that their priorities are seriously flawed.  With a new perspective, that is less deceptive and delusional, both friends discover deeper aspects of life.<br /><br />With reflections on the meaning of love, family, and the importance of one's job, this movie is much deeper than you might think. This is one of the best movies of the year!
B000UX6THK|2.0|the series start very well, with a lot of good actors and actrees but then in the middle of the series all went confuse, with a lot of nowhere dialogs, much time waste in seing people doing nothing but waste your time watching them.  but the very best is the chapter 29, my wife and I waste a month watching the series and in the chapter 29 the final is NOTHING, the bad spirit posses the cop, but what happen to the other people? wich is the origen of the evil?  if you have time and money to waste then buy the series otherwise do not lose your time. do something else.  thank very much.  raul rodriguez  MEXICO
B003L16FAE|4.0|So yet another original bare bones blu ray release finally gets the decent treatment it so rightly deserves.   When Predator debuted on Blu-ray a couple of years back there were some mixed reviews. I actually rated it quite highly, although it could obviously have been better, (featuring a relatively low bit-rate MPEG-2 transfer), that it was certainly a marked improvement over the really shoddy looking DVD with it's noise and grain. The other gripe about the original release was of course, the fact that it completely lacked any extras. So now, Fox have recitifed the situation (or if you're feeling more cynical - decided to nick some more cash out the fans back pockets) by releasing an inevitabvle remastered special edition to blu ray.     And here it is, newly encoded, dual layer 50GB disc crammed with all the extras from the DVD including McTiernan's commentary and the 'If it bleeds we can kill it' making of documentary.     So how does it fare? Well, in fairness I think the remastered picture in this edition could well incite the same amount of criticism as the old one, but for the opposite reason. Personally I think it's great, bright, clear, immensely vived and colourful and whereas the previous edition only really looked \\"Hi-Def\\" in a number of places, this looks pretty immaculate throughout. Black levels are also greatly improved. However, all of this comes at a price, which some fans may not like, because seemingly to combat the gripes about grain and noise this remaster is pretty heavy on the digital noise reduction. So if you liked the rougher, grittier texture of the original print, you're probably going to be disappointed. Faces look particularly \\"smoothed over\\" and a little waxy in certain shots, but I should add that this is NOT the case all the time. In fact facial close ups for example look great, and incredibly detailed, (you can even see the texture of the camouflaged face paint) the jungle looks beautfully sharp and thoroughly alive and generallythe print does a good job of masking the dirtier looking scenes. I felt that for the most part the picture looked much more naturally \\"hi-def\\" than obviously \\"tinkered with\\", but I must confess there were a few bits where I really felt they'd overdone it on the enhancements somewhat, and that's the only reason why i've dropped a star. At the end of the day tho, I think a blu ray where everything mostly looks like a DVD, is far worse than a blu ray where everything mostly looks hi definition. But this I'm sure will be up to what you prefer.     Not sure if the sound has been changed since the last release, but it is still a totally engaing and absorbing 5.1 DTS HD Master audio track. This was my favourite thing about the original release, and it is totally replicated in the ultimate hunter edition. It's a brilliantly balanced track, giving great clarity and detail in the quieter scenes, exploding into hefty machine gun fire and explosions later on that pound your speakers without ever sounding too overbearing.     So all in all, whether this release is for you will come down to the remastered picture quality. If you dont mind the film looking polished, vibrant and, in certain places noticeably artifically polished, you will love it; if you'd rather watch the film closer to it's original intended look, I would hang on to (or indeed go out and buy) the original release.
B003FMTZOM|5.0|Another terrific album by the amazing and talented Christina Aguilera. She pulls out a lot of wonderful vocal styles here with a combination of upbeat, jazzy and melodic songs. Her range is wonderful and each song is one to hear over and over again, without skipping a single track. The Parental Advisory symbol is fitting here even though all of her songs on here hardly have bad language, because a few of the tracks do, and one has an implication of some pregorative sexual meanings.      She always comes up with new ways to incorporate her music to the world and with powerful vocals to match them. I give this album because each song is outstanding and to be loved by all fans of Christina(like me) and others who are just getting introduced to her music. Some of the stand out songs, even though they all are are Bionic, WOOHOO, You Lost Me(The video is terrific and matches the song perfectly),Desnudate, Lift Me Up, Glam and Prima Donna just to name a few. Parents if your kids are just getting into Christina Aguilera this is one album to not get them, but get her self-titled debut album which has songs that are more friendly for that age group.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I was so happy when this came in the mail. Not only is the story of Mulan heartwarming, courageous, and inspiring, the style of animation and the legend behind the movie is gorgeous as well. In addition, the special features and \\"Behind the Scenes\\" info given out made me love the movie even more. What I liked best was seeing all of the concept art that was drawn before deciding on the permanent character designs was chosen. I'd recommend this to any Disney fan.

B002VPE1AW|3.0|The movie doesn't really go anywhere.  Nothing interesting happens.  There is no cool dialog.  The only really good part of the movie is the big fight at the end.  The animals are pretty cool too, since they all breath through blowholes on their neck or chest.  Except the giant blue alien humanoids, who have noses for no apparent reason.  I didn't find the computer graphics to be all that groundbreaking or breathtaking, but I do admit the motion capture to animate the movement was a nice touch.    I regret paying $19.99 for this movie at Wal*Mart.  I really should have waited for it to hit the $5 bin.
B000FVGN00|5.0|Released after his successful \\"Electric Warrior\\" album, \\"The Slider\\" is my favorite Bolan album. I think it shows him at his best.  It improves on \\"Electric Warrior\\" without getting into some of the more off beat experimentation that came later.  While his later albums aren't bad, I don't feel they rise to the quality level of this offering.
B002UXRGLG|4.0|I have no idea why the stupid people dubbed over Sir David Attenborough with Opera Winfry.  Sir Attenborough is the definitive voice for a nature documentary.  Opera Winfry is just a talk show host.    I'm going to assume that you already know this is awesome, so I won't talk about that part at all, and I'll mention the things that suck about this.    First and foremost, as mentioned above, make sure you get the real version and not the one with Opera.  Secondly, the foley work in this is terrible.  There are all kinds of loud distinct noises that just don't sound like they go with with action on the screen.  A slow-motion video of a tiny frog the size of a water droplet doesn't have a loud full-speed soundtrack of hopping noises.  They seemed to try and add outrageous sounds to everything they could, and it sucks.  Lastly, the menus are annoying and aggravating.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|As many people who collect DVD's know the movie studios are constantly rereleasing films in different packaging as a way to make more money. Sometimes the studios are guilty for squandering money from consumers when they release a film yet again on DVD, only with a different cover art and if the purchaser is lucky you might get some extra new bonus material. However, with the rerelease of \\"LA Confidential\\" the studio gave the film a complete overhaul, not only in the DVD art, but the film itself has been completely restored to impeccable quality and there are a ton of new bonus features. Buying this new set is like watching the film all over again!<br /> \\"LA Confidential\\" deals with the underbelly of Hollywood in the 1950's where sex, greed, political scandal, and murder are examined by a bunch of Los Angeles police detectives headed by a then-unknown Russell Crowe in one of his first big-screen acting gigs. Guy Pearce (known for playing a drag queen in \\"Priscilla-Queen of the Dessert) and Kevin Spacey are Crowe's partners-in-crime. The film is stolen by the convincing performance by Kim Bassinger who plays a sexy Hollywood starlette who happens to be a call-girl. This role won Bassinger the Oscar for Outstanding Supporting Performance by an Actress. The movie also won the Oscar for Best Screeenplay.<br /> Upon release in 1997 the movie was a huge financial success raking in nearly $130,000,000.<br /> The DVD is filled to the brim with extras including new interviews, commentary, and more and comes with a bonus CD that features music from the film.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I went to see this movie not expecting it to be that good, but wanted something to do for the afternoon. But \\"Salt\\" actually exceeded my expectations. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a tough and smart CIA agent accused of being a secret mole working for Russian defectors and plotting to assassinate the president of Russia (during his visit to the U.S.), and later the President of the U.S. himself. Her superiors immediately try to apprehend her, but Salt escapes them and embarks upon an action-packed, car-smashing, stunt-driven chase thriller as she seeks to prove her innocense and wipe out her evil Russian accusers.    But is Salt really innocent? Is she really a Russian spy, or are others within her agency the real spies? This rollercoaster ride of adventure and suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing until the very end. In spite of the obvious holes in the plot and the implausible stunts, \\"Salt\\" delivers on action, suspense and entertainment, and Jolie plays the role superbly. Judging by the movie's ending, you can bet your bullets that there will be a \\"Salt\\" sequel. Can't wait 'til next summer!
0061537969|4.0|Though not a race car enthusiast, this book brought a new respect for the intelligence and foresight of speed car  drivers. The dog's story is fabulous though he claims his long tongue inhibits his speaking ability, he finds ways to express himself, i.e., court papers which give the evil twins full custody. Of course, Enzo is correct. The message of the book seems to be to remain calm until the crisis has come, not before when we humans tend to catastropize what MIGHT happen to us. The book is superbly written and is one you may want to read over just to give yourself a lft.  Janet Carroll, author of From One Bitch To Another
B0037QGS0A|5.0|As I read some of the reviews I am more than a little convinced that some reviewers didn't understand that Chloe the character is the one making and pulling all the strings. While Fatal Attraction type movies are often predictable, the move that Chloe places on Julianne Moore's character is also placed on the audience, and I doubt many honest viewers can say they saw what was coming down when all three characters got together momentarily at the cafe.<br /><br />The opening scenes have Amanda Seyfried (who is GREAT, btw!) talking about how she \\"uses words.\\" One is immediately tempted to condescend to what appears a simple-mindedness on the part of a young and extremely attractive prostitute. WATCH OUT! You'll be snookered, too. I loved it, and the contrast of the young-and-beautiful with the \\"not-knowing-how-to-grow-old\\" set was ballsy and well-done.<br /><br />The idea of fantasy vs. Moore's OB-GYN advice that an \\"orgasm is merely a series of contractions.\\" When Chloe is having sex with someone she's not into, she gazes and fixates on her lover's shoes, and has what one dead-headed reviewer regarded as a \\"shoegasm.\\" While the term does make one chuckle, there should be praise for a writer/director who can at least TRY to reflect the nature of sexual fantasy during sex. Not an easy thing to do outside of animation.<br />Liam Neison and Moore are flawless, but it's Seyfried who one comes away wanting to see more of (no, I don't just mean naked)... And Atom Ergoyan as well. If I see either name on a coming project, I am there.

Mr Bryson does not understand a thing about Europe or it's culture, no matter how many places he visits, how many miles he covers or how many years he chooses to live here, he remains and represents the average American mind, short of the ability to understand - and even worse, wanting to understand - anything that lies beneath the surface.
B00005QIPH|5.0|When The Strokes first started being introduced to the world by music magazines, many people were stating how great they were. Heck, the only reason why I actually got the album was because Noel Gallagher (Singer, song writer and guitarist for Oasis) had stated in the band's website that The Strokes were the best band in the world and that everyone should own this album. Having said that I decided to follow one of my music idols suggestions and give it a listen.<br /><br />It wasn't as I imagined, in fact it was nothing as I had predicted. They weren't \\"Rock n Roll\\", they weren't Brit Pop, they weren't Punk Rock either and as I listened more and more the first thing that came to my mind at one point was The Ramones but I knew there weren't too many similarities (except for their fashion). I played the album again once it was done and I knew at that moment that I was hooked. I probably played `Is This It' that day at least 5 times, and songs as `The Modern Age', `Someday', `Last Nite' and `Hard To Explain' probably 15. It was a sound I had never heard before (Mind you, I was 18 and still had a lot to learn from music) but I knew it was the best thing I had heard since Oasis ` (What's The Story?) Morning Glory': one of my all time favorite albums.<br /><br />I first owned the US version of `Is This It' which contained `How It Started' as track #9 instead of what originally was going to be `New York City Cops' which ended in the UK version, all because 9/11 was still fresh and to avoid any wrongdoing. I ordered later through the internet the latter edition and again it stayed in my CD player for quite a while. Either way the US version delivers, and even though their weakest song was replaced by what many fans consider their best song, it is a 5/5 star album (or 10/10 for many critics).<br /><br />I saw the band live at the Billboard Live in Miami Beach, Florida shortly after I had become a fan, and they blew my mind away. Their sound may not be crisp on the album, but I guess it just goes with their style, and if you've ever had the pleasure in witnessing them playing live, I can assure you will give them more respects after that.<br /><br />Come to think of it after The Strokes broke into the world of music, other bands such as The White Stripes, The Hives, and The Yeah Yeah Yeahs followed and were considered also favorites from whoever liked The Strokes. I don't want to call them revolutionary but they did open our minds (And ears) with their sort of distinctive style. And for many that consider that The Strokes went downhill after their following album `Room On Fire' which was good, but not good enough to beat their debut (but then again what is?) We cannot stop to admit that this album will be in the Top 100 as best albums of all times, and also one of the best debut albums ever.

B001AQO3QA|2.0|I have had all the best versions of Aliens be it on VHS, DVD and Laser.  I still have the Laser transfer (a special box set of Alien and Aliens, which was reviewed to be the best picture quality at the time).  However, there are portions of \\"Aliens\\" where the picture is grainy and weak.  Apparently, this was because all of the masters  of \\"Aliens\\" (I think one part of the movie in particular) were either damaged, wore out, destroyed or lost.  It appears when they put together the movie for the special edition release, they had to use (put together) the best of what they had.  Just to note, the DVD version I have also is also grainy and weak in the same areas of the Laser version. So the question is, if there are not any good masters to work with for the \\"Aliens\\" Blu-ray, will the quality of the picture be any better then the recent new \\"Predator\\" Blu-ray release (a waxy looking picture with blemishes and no depth or realism resulting from where they tried to clean up it up).

You do not want to besmirch the image.<br /><br />Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) in this presentation is just as observant as usual but is better informed of different disciplines that the original. He uses wily disguises and beautiful women to accomplish his goal of detecting and foiling the cunning bad guys. This looks like the pilot for a series or at least the beginning of a film series.<br /><br />Dr. Watson (Jude Law) is more of second Holms but a different set of bad habits. He saves Holmes' bacon several times. However, Watson wants to go his own way and settle down with his newfound love Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams.)<br /><br />This looks like the pilot for a series or at least the beginning of a film series.

0375701427|2.0|I've read most of Philip Roth's novels but not in order of publication.  I came to this one late and find it hard to understand why it received so much praise.  The writing is overblown and pompous.  The allegorical drive to make the characters stand for the underside and disillusionment of America in the 1960s means that the characters collapse under the weight of everything they're supposed to symbolize.  All the female characters are monsters -- that's the word the narrator and characters use over and over again -- but not interesting monsters.  And we learn far more than we need to do about the details of glove manufacturing.  There are definitely some interesting ideas here, but the book never comes together as a fully realized, well-crafted novel.  If you want to read mainstream Roth, I recommend giving this one a miss and reading THE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA, or better yet, pick up ZUCKERMAN UNBOUND, an  unsung masterpiece.

This album incudes 22 single tracks from her 2 albums The Fame Monster and Fame.  Both where released separtely but released together in a single for all of Lady GaGa fans in the winter of 2009.  This is one of the best Dance, Club or Hip-hop Albums to come out in the last 10 years for above none.  The music will keep rocking from the first track to the last one on the album.

B0021L8V0M|5.0|This summer has had some outstanding summer movies, and Salt is one of them. It starts with Angelina Jolie in the title role, Evelyn Salt, a CIA spy. A Russian defector suddenly shows up at one of their front businesses. During questioning, he announces to one an all that the visiting Russian president will be assassinated - by Evelyn Salt, supposedly a deep-cover Russian spy. The fact that the 'defector' then kills two agents escaping the building never enters into some folks' wholehearted belief his story. They take her in for questioning, she busts loose (super-agent that she is), and the chase is on.<br /><br />I really can't say anything else about the plot. There are so many reversals than anything would be a spoiler, and you deserve to see them for yourself. Of course, Jolie completely takes command of the role, and of pretty much everything else in sight. I'm sure it will surprise no one that the role was orginally written for a male actor ('Edwin,' not 'Evelyn') but, when it came time to cast the manliest action actor they could find, Jolie's name topped the list.<br /><br />This movie stands well above its genre. There are plenty of fight scenes, some pretty amazing chases, and a satisfying ending that begs for sequels. More than just that, there's an actual plot, one that keeps you guessing almost (but not quite) to the end.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B003LAH7MU|5.0|Sting's career has had more twists and turns than a mountain road in the Swiss Alps. I have always admired his knack for choosing the path less travelled. He never plays it safe. Breaking up The Police was proof of that. Reuniting them 20 years later was an even bigger shocker. His acting roles, Broadway, and the lute albums. His journey has certainly been interesting. This new CD of orchestral reinterpretations is another interesting bend in the road. Sure, many other artists have gone the orchestral route. With an artist like Scorpions it feels a bit forced. Sting's compositions lend themselves wonderfully to this treatment. The original songs range from playful to brooding and everything in between. The orchestra picks up these themes and enhances the music in a beautiful way. The songs are seen in a new light. Very enjoyable!
B00275EGWY|1.0|After it won the academy award for best picture I decided to check it out. It was a shock to find that this movie has no plot, the acting is amatuerish at best, and even though there is a crew defusing bombs- no suspense whatsoever. Even though it's a story involving soldiers there are no villians or personal conflicts in this story. While one watches this film it appears that it goes out of its way not to be political and this takes the wind out of its sail as events unfold. The two worst scenes are when the soldiers are sniping some militants in the desert and even though they're shooting people there is no change of expressions on their faces whatsoever- just like they're doing a job. If you can call this a subplot, the hero James befriends some Iraqi boy making a connection with him. Later the hero finds him stitched up with an explosives inside him. Unfortunately, even though you think it would reveal some of the hero's character, it just doesn't go anywhere. Apparently, an academy award means nothing these days, the only indication that a film may be good is how much it makes at the box office. This was a 12 million dollar bomb. Even though it won an award, this movie is so vacuous it may actually be one of the worst movies ever made.
1416589473|5.0|Got my copy this morning, finished it by this afternoon. It was an engaging read. I think appreciation of it benefits from being an ArenaNet/Guild Wars fan, especially with the lore touches. If you've been following ArenaNet's gradual release of information about the upcoming Guild Wars 2, I think you'll really get the most out of this novel. I loved seeing this new and updated world of Tyria, along with just the right amount of touches and callbacks to the amazing lore and history of the original. The characters were well-realized and the various new races quite intriguing. I think this will mostly appeal to existing fans or those that are interested in the new game...
B000PDYVVG|1.0|I bought the Kindle \\"no book priced over 9.99 - ever!\\"    I wanted to read this book and was willing to pay $9.99 before I went to see the movie.  No Way!  Amazon - you disappoint me - I was on your side - thought you had  GREAT product.  I even bought Kindles for friends!  Now I've got an overpriced piece of electronic reading machine!  Publisher - I'm not going to read the book - just wait for the movie on Red Box.  I'm NOT of WalMart pricing mentality - just want what I researched and was \\"promised\\" in this e-reader.

B00004Y6OA|5.0|Being a young shaver at 17, I was just starting to really get into rock n' roll in 1980...only prior to this band, had I discovered Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. I wasn't into punk rock yet, but had heard of the Sex Pistols by seeing a late night commercial based on their iconic Never Mind The Bollocks album release on TV, so I missed that boat. This was all before MTV had finally immersed me into this music, which opened the door to the many british, hard rock, new wave, punk, ska, and metal bands via music video. I just know this-after those first two discoveries (Hendrix and Zeppelin), I wanted to hear MORE of this Rock n' Roll music. I was getting hooked. At this time, I absolutely hated and loathed DISCO-this music was not muscular or testosterone-driven enough for me, it was SO boring and one-dimensional. I started listening to more FM Rock radio to feed my growing addiction to harder-edged Rock music. Via FM Rock, I discovered Pink Floyd, Steely Dan, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Sabbath with Ozzy, Fleetwood Mac, Rush, Kiss, and countless others. One day while listening to FM rock radio, the disk jockey introduces a song called, \\"And The Cradle Will Rock\\", played it, and I was like, \\"Whoah who is this!?\\" I like this! I like this a lot! The DJ says \\"That was by VanHalen...\\" a few days later, I went to the local mall to seek this band out at the record store. I bought Women and Children First on 8 track tape because my car had an 8-track deck in it, and I put it in. I turned up the volume LOUD.  The 1st song on the album \\"And the Cradle..\\" was blaring through my car speakers for the first time...that moment was SO magical...it was great. I clearly remember staring at this now iconic green album cover- a black and white photo of four guys, with their guitarist in the middle of them. Didn't know who the guitar player was.  As I got into the album more, I began to pay attention to their guitarist more. \\"Damn, that guy can play!! Who is he?\\" I look at the album credits-Alex VanHalen-Drums, David Lee Roth-Lead Vocals, Michael Anthony-Bass, Vocals...Edward VanHalen-Guitar, Vocals. Suddenly, there was this emotional seismic shift. Although I thought the entire band was great, and the songs were great-I immediately began to focus MORE on the guitarist, and his playing. Also I was a young musician then, and I played bass. Eddie VanHalen's lightening-fast solos and innovative, over-the-top guitar playing on this album literally BLEW ME AWAY to the point that I didn't want to play bass anymore-I wanted to ROCK OUT, so I begged my mom to give me money to go and buy me a guitar from a pawn shop. That was it. This is THE album that CHANGED MY LIFE musically, forever. The band at this time was extremely busy, yet confident, young, hungry, had loads of swagger, their lyrics laden with sexual innuendos and drive, (which began to attract loads and loads of screaming girls), had unabashed male testosterone, and were on the cusp of taking over the world-and later they did just that. I finally found what I was looking for-a hard edged rock band to look up to. Being that this was the very FIRST ROCK ALBUM I ever bought, made it that more meaningful. Never before had I heard  a band or even guitar playing like this, and I immediately went back to buy the first two albums, VanHalen I & II. Today, I am in my late 40's and don't rock out as much these days, but I STILL love this band!!! I think I am emotionally attached to them forever. With Zeppelin, you had four entities that were equal. With VanHalen, clearly EDDIE and DLR were the driving force behind VH's classic sound and success. I go on YOUTUBE and look at live footage of this iconic band in their prime in the early 80's and I still get goosebumps! No other band, or guitar player (besides Page and Hendrix), or album single-handedly impacted me that way. Yes the album is short, but its impact and influence is still felt. To me, WOMEN & CHILDREN FIRST IS an ABSOLUTE CLASSIC.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|`The Big Lebowski' is one of those films that started off small and over the years has gathered a cult like status. With Lebowski fests and often repeated phrases from the film, this has certainly entered the film goers psyche.<br /><br />After `The Dude's' rug gets urinated on after a case of mistaken identity he very rapidly gets drawn into a convoluted kidnapping mystery, when all he really wants is to get a replacement rug, drink White Russians and get back to his bowling league. Not too much to ask you would think. Yet he finds himself fending off threats from all sides and tries valiantly to keep his car from being totally wrecked in the process.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is great as The Dude and plays the part spot on. His long hair, slightly vacant look and stoner drawl fit the role to a tee. John Goodman is also good as The Dudes angry Vietnam vet friend Walter and the rest of the cast turn out great performances as well. The direction is very good and the more weird dreamy scenes are especially fun to watch.<br /><br />All in all this is a low key film that has risen to the top of the barrel over the years and it will keep you interested and will raise a laugh or two as you go along. There is a certain appeal to The Dude's laid back lifestyle and his charm really makes this film. Sit back and enjoy this minor cult classic.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00004W4UB|5.0|Wow! indeed an anamzing tale that will never fail to keep you engaged from the begenning to the very end. I am not much of a fan of Julia Roberts, but this film really grabbed my attention towards her, my eyes were glued to the screen witnessing her every move, every motion, catching every bit of her emotion throughout the film, she delivers such a precise, fine performence that you simply remain out of words. A fine, fabulous performence from John Malkovich, a fine flesh and blood of a true artist and actor indeed. Everything from the dark atmosphere to the score will surely keep you engaged enough and do watch out for some really good performences.
1400052173|4.0|`The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' looks at the woman behind the HeLa cell line which is used in much of today's medical research centres around the world.  This is a mixture of biography, family history, a history of cell research, a look at the treatment of the social underclass in America and popular science, all rolled into one book.  The story unfold as the author uncovers various details during her ten year research, as well as after she gradually gains the trust and friendship of the remaining members of the Lacks family.  The family have been treated very poorly over the years by various medical institutions and con artists and they are rightly wary of reporters and those who may gain from their mothers story.  This reticence needed to be worked through before a deeper dialogue could develop and there always seemed to be an underlying suspicion and tension between the author and Lacks family despite the relationship she eventually developed.  There is a distinct lack of photos in this book, which we have come to expect from non-fiction books of this type and these would have added to the appeal of the book overall, as well as illustrating the various points raised and shown us the various people mentioned.  Saying that, this is easy to read and you can tell the authors passion and genuine interest in the topic she is writing about.  Henrietta Lacks and the HeLa cell line is woefully under-represented in modern scientific teaching and texts and this book goes some way to shedding light on the person behind one of the worlds most prevalent and groundbreaking cell lines.  This is engaging, fascinating and worth a read if you enjoy both biographies and popular science books.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0199537151|5.0|This is by far the best book I've ever read. What intrigued me the most was Shelley's style. Her language puts you in mood that I cannot easily put to words. Only three other authors have books similar to this: Rudyard Kipling (\\"The Man Who Would be King\\"), David Anthony Durham (\\"Acacia\\"), and Anthony Nana Kwamu (\\"Timbuktu Chronicles: Aida and the Chosen Soldier\\"). \\"Frankenstein\\" (the 1818 text) is just breathtaking! Highly recommended.
1582701709|1.0|I could not post this with zero stars, lamentably. This is at it's best disingenuous, trite and ill informed. At its worst it is irresponsible and dangerous.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is books like this is what gives manifesting and metaphysics a bad name.  I am not sure what repulses more, the author, for scheming a quick buck on a magic genie type book or my fellow man, that sadly never seems to want to disprove that there is a sucker born every minute.<br /><br />This book is an affront to all authors who delve into the power of thought and mind, conscious and subconscious, et al.  It is a wonderfully marvelous and rich field of study with grand merit.  The problem is there is effort to become self actualized and to accomplish becoming fully engaged.<br /><br />This book is insulting.  Imagine willing yourself to be healthy and lean - and eating all the ice cream you desire?!?!<br /><br />You can clearly blue print the life you want, but perhaps you should be meditating on having the intestinal fortitude and courage to accomplish a grand life and healthy body.  People want this book to be true because it is easy.<br /><br />I need to stop this review ... there is bile in my mouth from recalling it!
1439190275|5.0|I did Atkins back in 2005 and lost 58lbs. I was wearing the same size jeans I wore in high school. I was off my High Blood Pressure Medication. I was feeling good and looked great.  Then I cheated here and there (pizza and desserts) and kept telling myself, \\"look how much I have already lost, I can do this, it's not like I am as fat as I was. Right?\\" WRONG. Not only did I gain it all back but it found 12 more friends. Now I am on a stronger dose of High BP medication and considered pre-diabetic. I thought I was cheating to eat yummy foods; but in reality I was cheating myself of my own health.    I tried looking back into this way of eating with the books that were published after Dr. Atkins died, but they never really hit home like they did back in '05. And I got hit with the \\"Atkins Flu\\" that I didn't want to try to get past. That was myself being lazy. So I tried other diets; and failed because I was always hungry. This made me cranky and easily irritated - sorry friends and family. And try after try I would turn very low numbers like 1-2 on the scale. I understand those numbers if I was close to my goal, but I have a lot of weight to shed. It was very disappointing and discouraging. So...    When I heard about this book I thought I would give it one more try. After all, it did work for me once. The book is an easy read. These 3 doctors really gave it incite to why/how it works. Nice refresher for me and it gave some great pointers on how to avoid the \\"Atkins Flu\\". I can't believe one little tip would help me get past the flu and move on to losing weight without any distractions. In just the first week I lost 6.6 lbs. If that is not encouragement, I don't know what is.    I don't know about you, but I want to be that skinny person that I met back in 2005. I want to be in shape and not get winded for doing things like walking up 4 fights of stairs. I guess the big difference is that I want it now as bad as I wanted it back then. If you want to be skinny too - go pick up a copy for yourself. You have nothing but the weight to lose.
0399156577|1.0|i own every book Ms. Roberts has ever written, so naturally, i couldn't wait for this one.  very disapointed.  the book reads like a dog training manual and a let down at the end.  not her usual.  love her in death series.  i'll keep reading her, but i hope she gets back to her former writing style.
B001LF347E|5.0|Truly well written, Actors all give their characters substance and passion.  I am more than entertained it brings to one's mind what might have been.  History and the arts are never far from the truth.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is about a teenage boy named Percy (Logan Lerman) hidden in the real world, who learns that he's the son of Poseidon. Zeus (Sean Bean), as well as other gods accuse Percy of stealing Zeus' lightning and he must learn to protect himself in order to survive.<br /><br />  It's nice to see Chris Columbus return to making the kind of movie he's good at, since both Christmas with the Kranks and I Love You Beth Cooper were horrible. But Percy Jackson isn't as good as the book since the effects are weak and Columbus' direction with the first 2 Harry Potter films is much better. With Percy Jackson it's as if he wasn't even trying and as if he was thinking \\"I made two Harry Potter films, I can make a Percy Jackson one with my eyes close.\\" While the movie doesn't follow the book close enough either, too much was cut out.<br /><br />  Percy Jackson is basically Harry Potter with Greek Gods instead of Wizards after all. Percy is a hyper active kid who has no idea he's special and he lives with his mom and his smelly step-dad that he can't stand. Soon teachers turn out to be not what they seem and he finds himself in a world of magic and mystery.<br /><br />  That does sound a bit like Potter doesn't it ? The author of the books brings more originality to his books than you'd think though. I'm reading the first book now and it's really as if I never seen the movie. The book is excellent, the movie doesn't really come alive until the middle when Madusa (Uma Thurman) appears and then the movie is finally fun. Up to that point the effects and the bad costumes made me almost give up on the movie, but it does at least get better.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The first time I saw the movie, I didn't realize George Cloony did comedy roles. But he's great. It took me a couple times of watching this movie, but it grew on me. Then I lent my DVD out, never got it back, so now I've got another one. (Now, I just tell 'friends' to get their own copy!) I also have the soundtrack from the movie. It's just a great funny movie. All the actors (and singers) are good, and the movie takes an extremely exaggerated view (politically mainly!) of the depression times the movie was set in. The Soggy Bottom Boys are a hoot. (I really couldn't tell they were lipsinging) And John Goodman as a Bible salesman is especially evil mindedly good! He's such a jerk! (in the role!)
B002ZG997C|5.0|I'm a little surprised how turned off people are when they realize when this movie is about.  I can understand that some people might not have had the best experience with religion or faith, but this movie, when looking at it from a strictly fictional perspective is wholly enjoyable.    Try to go into the film with any biases left at the door step and you'll find yourself drawn into the movie.  I really enjoyed it.  Great acting, nothing felt cheezy or overdone.  Anyways, I won't repeat what's already been said.  I hope you pick this one up!
0790731452|5.0|I lent out my original DVD of this movie and never got it back (go figure!) It's sooooo goofy! It's really very funny! Jack Nicholson in dual roles as the president and a greedy con-man is a hoot! And Tom Jones, doing what he has always done, which is singing, is a funny extra (unless one is too young to even know who he is!). The alien hooker with the pointed hooters is a riot too.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|\\"The work of Sade and Masoch cannot be regarded as pornography; it merits the more exalted title of 'pornology' because its erotic language cannot be reduced to the elementary functions of ordering and describing [sexual practices]\\"--Gilles Deleuze    This film takes what would be an otherwise glib, overly-simplistic and therefore basically meaningless verbal/conceptual equation--\\"fascists=sadists\\"--and gives it genuine meaning/significance by following it through and enacting it \\"to the letter,\\" as it were, by superimposing the setting and various conextual (social, political, historical) aspects of fascist WWII Northern Italy upon (what one gathers are) the most lurid and repugnant episodes from de Sade's work--instances of copraphagia being, perhaps, the most disturbing.    Pasolini carefully and aptly emphasizes the \\"institutional\\" character of sadism, something which [[ASIN:0942299558 Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty & Venus in Furs]]Deleuze also describes in his essay on the fundamental differences and disjunctions that exist between the practices and psycho-seuxual \\"attitudes\\" of sadism and machoscism (seeing the two phenomena as fundamentally incommensurate, rather than reciprocal and complementary): \\"The Middle Ages distinguished with considerable insight between two types of commerce with the devil: the first resulted from possession, the second from a pact of alliance. The sadist thinks in terms of institutionalized possession [a fact that the scene in which the officials promulgate the \\"laws\\" governing the torture palace, for instance, makes concrete], the masochist in terms of contracted alliance. Possession is the sadist's particular form of madness just as the pact is the masochist's.\\" By this definition, fascism--in its rigid codification, fervent desire for complete and absolute socio-political control, etc.--is the most sadistic form of government; a fact that this film deftly illustrates.    Once one jettisons the various moral attitudes and valueswith which they've been inculcated, what strikes one most about the film (as well as, one gathers, the work of de Sade) is its \\"strangeness,\\" particularly insofar as orthodox and \\"normal\\" bourgeois mores and practices (the dinner party, the moment of storytelling and party \\"entertainment,\\" etc.) are commingled with not merely the most base sexual acts (copulation, sodomy, etc.), but sexual acts that are oddly \\"creative\\" in their desire to somehow go \\"beyond\\" the erotic/sensual satisfactions that these relatively \\"orthodox\\" sexual acts accord. This film seems to imply that, to the sadist, sex in and of itself is somehow not \\"enough\\" to give one pleasure, and thus one seeks to derive pleasure from perverting, altering, debasing and distorting myriad commonplace social/cultural rituals, ceremonies and (of course) INSTITUTIONS: thus we, in watching the film, bear witness to things like a series of mock weddings that the torturers both engage in and subject their prisoners to...    Overall: a fascinating film.

B002ZG98M8|4.0|It's been twenty years since \\"Predator 2\\" showcased the monstrous hunter in a solo capacity. Finally, after all that time 20th Century Fox brings the hunters back to theaters with the recently released sci-fi action film, \\"Predators\\".    \\"Predators\\" follows a group of Earth's deadliest killers, led by a mysterious mercenary (Adrien Brody), who find themselves trapped on a strange world. As the group tries to find a way off the planet, they soon discover that they have been placed on this world for a reason...to be hunted. Now, they are locked in a deadly fight for survival with beings far deadlier than anything they've ever encountered.    You know, there's something about this series that's bothered me for quite some time now. It's nothing regarding the previous two films in the franchise, both of which were quite good in my opinion. No, what bothers me is why would 20th Century Fox, who owns the rights to the character, leave the series effectively dead for so long?    Sure the character appeared in the hit \\"versus\\" movie, \\"Alien Vs Predator\\" and its extremely disappointing sequel \\"Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem\\". But as a stand alone property the character proved successful, and the movies were extremely entertaining and profitable to boot. So, it's beyond me why the decision was made to shelve the property for such an extended period. Especially when so many countless sub-par horror franchises are allowed to exist long past their welcome. Anyways, I digress...    In charge of crafting a story that would serve as a hard-hitting return to the big screen for the character worthy of the original is screenwriter/director/producer Robert Rodriguez (\\"Sin City\\"). Robert's story brings the action back to a jungle atmosphere (albeit on another planet) harkening back to the first film, but ups the ante in every respect. The story is chock full of incredibly entertaining action set pieces, with a break-neck pacing to keep the momentum running full steam ahead from start to finish; however, if you're coming to this movie looking for in-depth character study, look somewhere else.    Now, that shouldn't come as any surprise to fans of the series, this franchise has never been about character development or engaging drama. It's always been about the hunt, and those who are unfortunate enough to become the hunted. I'm sure that some people (mostly critics that look down their noses at these types of movies) will view the lack of character driven drama as a weakness; if you ask me, the reason these movies work is because they never try to over complicate the situation. It's a monster movie plain and simple, and what the audience wants is to see great visual effects, incredible action, and some entertaining chase and/or fight sequences between the hunter and the hunted. In this, \\"Predators\\" absolutely nails it, and hopefully brings the series back into popularity.    On an interesting side note, Robert Rodriguez actually wrote the original script for this film prior to finishing up work on his first breakthrough hit \\"Desperado\\" in 1995. However, upon completion 20th Century Fox opted not to move forward with another sequel and shelved the project. I don't know if any of you out there really cared to know that tidbit of information, but I just wanted to throw it out there anyway. Moving on.    Assisting Robert in reinvigorating the franchise was the film's director Nimrod Antal. I wasn't sure how Nimrod would be as director for this long-awaited follow-up. I mean his previous directorial effort \\"Armored\\" was a decent enough action flick. Yet, it never really felt like it was anything great compared to any number of action movies I could find from Direct-to-DVD releases featuring the action heroes of yesteryear.    However, after seeing how Nimrod Antal handled \\"Predators\\" I have to say that he was undoubtedly the right man for the job. After all, he delivered a pulse-pounding thrill ride that blew his previous film out of the water with considerable ease. Not to mention, the previews didn't ruin every single plot point for this film, a problem that plagued \\"Armored\\" and probably led to my less than thrilled perception of the movie.    Leading the ensemble cast, and is probably the most surprising bit of casting I have seen for a movie in quite some time, is Academy Award® winner Adrien Brody (\\"King Kong\\"). When his casting was first announced, I was a little leery, as I'm sure many fans were, because Adrien didn't exactly look the part of a man that the Predator would find a challenging prey. Yet the more I read about how the idea was to distance this entry in some respects from what's come before by not going with a muscle-bound warrior, but instead utilize a more cerebral character, the more I became intrigued by the possibility he presented.    In the end, a somewhat bulked-up Adrien Brody created a believable adversary for the Predators. He blended together elements of Arnold's no-nonsense qualities with those of a keenly intelligent, semi-manipulative, world-weary individual that will do whatever it takes to survive.    Portraying some of the other collected prey for the titular characters are Topher Grace, Alice Braga, and Walton Goggins. As I stated earlier the story wasn't one that really challenged any member of the cast dramatically, granted that was never the intention. That being said, the cast didn't just slack off and phone in their performances either.    Topher Grace (\\"Spider-Man 3\\") played the kind of character that always seems to suit him perfectly, that of a sniveling weasel of a man, who always feels more important than he really is. Alice Braga (\\"Repo Men\\") as a tough-as-nails soldier was surprisingly believable in the role and helped to balance out the extreme machismo of Adrien Brody's character and most of the other cast members. Then there's actor Walton Goggins (TV's \\"Justified\\") as a convict that sets out as only being interested in self-preservation, but eventually becomes somewhat of a team player. As I said, none of them really had to stretch to flesh out their characters, but they all did well in the roles and sold them to the audience convincingly.    Making slightly extended cameo appearances in the film were actors Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo. Laurence was very entertaining for the brief time he was in the film as a soldier that has snapped with reality after being marooned on this planet for quite some time. Danny Trejo wasn't given a whole lot more to do in the movie than Laurence, and his role felt as if it had just been shoe-horned in to the film. This was a real shame, because Danny always delivers an interesting character every time he appears in a movie. This time though, his appearance was most likely due to the fact that he has acted in virtually every single movie Robert Rodriguez has worked on since \\"Desperado\\", so this one should be no exception. Thus, his character felt like an afterthought.    Well, after waiting so long for a third installment, it's nice to see that the \\"Predator\\" franchise hasn't lost its edge. Combining some of the best elements of the previous two films, taking the hunt off-world, plus some terrific action scenes and visual effects, makes \\"Predators\\" the triumphant return to cinema's that this series deserves.    \\"Predators\\" is rated R for violence and language.
0439023491|5.0|This review is coming from a non-reader.  By that, I mean I generally do not read for fun, especially not anything described as \\"young adult\\".  However, I decided to give the series a try after I heard a friend who had just earned a doctorate degree in Political Science rave about it.  I had just finished my bachelors program and had some free time, and I am glad I chose to fill it with these books.<br /><br />I have never cried while reading a book until I read Catching Fire.  And it was only in chapter 4!  This book has the action and suspense of the first book, but added a whole new dimension of human growth, weakness, and sacrifice. I appreciated this a lot because while the action and suspense is entertaining, I don't feel like it has the ability to really \\"move\\" me.  I also found this installment to be more mature than the first. The character development is fantastic.  Katniss is a different girl, which I am grateful for.  It would have been dishonest of Collins to keep her the same after she had killed and witnessed the killings of several teenagers (children, really).  Other characters develop beautifully and unexpectedly, such as Haymitch, Madge, and Katniss' mother.<br /><br />A definite page-turner, but I was motivated not so much by the thrill of the Games (which was there, trust me), but by raw and familiar human struggling.  I was not anticipating the way the book ended and am itching for Mockingjay.<br /><br />By the way, this non-reader read this book in 2 days.
B001O54NHQ|4.0|There's not much to really say; if you don't know that Prince made an awesome Batman Soundtrack Album for Tim Burton's greatness, then I suggest that you get that rock off of yourself, and buy this thing.

BTW: The only reason I don't give it 5 Stars is because there is no Special Edition that includes the videos...get on it Warner Brothers!

0307454541|1.0|I love to read. I often read three or four books at the same time, keeping them in different rooms in the house. This drives my wife crazy. So she finally approached me and asked me to try one of her books. So being the nice guy I am, I agreed to read it. Holy cow. I've never seen an author write so much painful, detailed background on a handful of characters and then have them remain as flat as the pages from which they spring. Really? Two hundred pages of some of the most boring character development and scene setting ever. I normally drop a book if it hasn't piqued my interest by page 100. This time I committed to read the whole thing. I should have been committed for sticking it out. This book was absolutely horrible. The tale was as bleak as the images of the countryside this guy paints. The storyline was disjointed and jumbled, and if you are able to maintain your focus and sanity throughout this mind-numbing tale, the \\"surprise\\" twist at the end wasn't surprising after all.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but I think the author's untimely death graciously saved the world from too many of these \\"masterpieces.\\"
0061906220|5.0|I love this book and have been giving it to friends with kids as gifts for years. Both parents and kids have always loved the book. It was originally self published and that's how I have been able to give it for years, it was released nationwide by Harper Collins this spring. I gave a copy to my daughters preschool class and they kept asking to read it every day. The illustrations and the rhythm of the story are wonderful for young kids and the idea of dealing with whatever life sends your way and being happy about it is a great concept for kids to learn especially if they are still figuring out how to handle the day to day frustrations of life. Pete the Cat doesn't let anything upset him, he just keeps smiling and singing about his shoes (as they keep changing color due to him walking into piles of strawberries, blueberries, mud etc). You will not be disappointed and will enjoy the book and song that goes along with the story.
0547258305|3.0|Premise: 5 stars.  A teenage girl who can kill with her bare hands and an uncle who uses her as his enforcer? She MUST have some serious issues.    Plot/Structure: 3 stars. The structure and plot is the Quest tossed with the Hero's Journey, romance, and treachery. Not original. The problem for me was NOT lack of originality (writers continue to recycle these ancient motifs for a reason. Because they speak to the human condition. Aren't we ALL looking for something in some sense?).     For me the problem was the execution: The plot and structure were TOO obvious. The pacing uneven, transition non-existent in places (one moment Po and Katsa are friends, the next they are lovers).  I thought Cashore did a decent job with the scene where Katsa and Po have sex for the first time. The prose was sensuous but I didn't think it gratuitious (parents with pre-teens might disagree with me here).      Characterization: 2 stars.  I didn't hate Katsa, nor did I find her annoying. I even felt sorry for her. And I DO think she changed in some ways: In the beginning of the story, Katsa shuts out people. But she allows Po into her life, doesn't she?  I think that qualifies as change.      In places, I wanted to understand her better. As an example: Katsa's choice to never marry or have children. There is NOTHING wrong with these choices. Plenty of men and women in real life make these same choices. My problem: Cashore never really tied Katsa's choices to anything we learn about Katsa.     Does Katsa not want to marry/have kids because she feels she will lose herself? If so, there is NOTHING wrong with that. Cashore just never made this connection to this or any other reason (Katsa could hate babies and that would satisfy me)    The other characters just weren't fully developed. I don't expect to learn the villain turned evil because Mommy and Daddy wouldn't buy him a pony when he was 5 (unless ponies are central to the story), but I do expect the heroine's romantic interest (and a major character) to be seem like a real person.  Po was just TOO perfect.     The writing/dialogue/description: 3 stars. In some places, very pretty to read; in others, difficult to follow. On some pages, Katsa's name seemed to appear a dozen times (I noticed this especially when someone would be speaking to Katsa)--the speaker already had her attention it was unnecessary to use her name again. In some places, the dialogue seemed natural, in others stilted. I also had a hard time \\"hearing\\" distinct voices among some characters. As for the Bitterblue issue: Yes, she is 10 years old. But she IS a Princess. She will NOT speak as the average 10 year old will speak (though Cashore could have tied these 2 pieces together).     So averaging these separate scores together results in a solid 3 stars.    Finally the names of people and places. I refuse to critique the names Cashore created for her characters and setting. One, for me it's usually no big deal. Two, creating \\"fantasy\\" names is HARD.     I do have a comment or two. First, the name Katsa. Aloud, it sounds like the first 2 syllabes of \\"Catsup\\" which caused my mind to add a \\"p\\" to the end of the name. Second, yeah, you know what's next: Po. Not the nickname I would have given a Prince (did Cashore explain how Po earned that name? Did I miss it) in any case, but the image that keeps popping up for me is    Po (from the movie Kung Fu Panda) in the voice of Manchee (the dog from the Knife of Never Letting Go) repeating the word \\"Poo\\" (as Manchee does)
0385737947|5.0|I can't wait for the second book to come out!!! I loved the world the author created, especially the language (which you find yourself saying when your done).

0312330529|5.0|this is a novel unlike any you will read. superbly written and engrossing. simply put, this is an extraordinary book. if you like books such as Papillon you will simply love this novel.
0140143505|3.0|I had heard so much about this book before reading it. This is one of those classic texts that all bibliophiles seem to read and adore, so I was thoroughly looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I was not as smitten as most readers seem to be. This slim volume chronicles the correspondence between New Yorker Hanff and the staff of an antiquarian bookstore in London. The entirety of the text is letters, as Hanff cultivates a relationship with the shop's staff, a relationship built entirely on transatlantic correspondence. The second part of the book is comprised of Hanff's memoirs of the trip she was finally able to take to London, sadly after the bookstore, Marks and Co. had closed, and after her primary correspondent had died. Certainly the the letters between Hanff and her primary correspondent, Frank Doel, are touching. The two developed quite a friendship. In the privations of the post-war London of the late-1940s and early 1950s, Hanff sent repeated care packages to the bookstore's staff, providing things completely unavailable in the United Kingdom- basics like eggs (real and powdered), oranges, and women's stockings. It return, Doel and his store provided Hanff with quite a reading list- even the most ardent of bibliophiles will likely be wowed by the density and depth of Hanff's reading list. Those elements aside, I preferred Hanff's memoirs of her time in London to the letters. I drank up her descriptions of the places, though I found it difficult to get interested in the people. In sum, while I found this book charming, it was not the amazing experience I was expecting. Bibliophiles will surely want to read it, but I'm not sure a general audience would find it engaging. In writing this, I feel like a bad voracious reader. I've missed something that makes this book a tremendous experience of other book lovers.
0061998494|5.0|I wished the book went on and on. I think he is one of the funniest people on TV. I even appreciate his talent more knowing the struggles he went through. I've read many books on celebs and many seem so cut throat as where he comes off as someone with flaws and makes the changes to correct them and moves on. I think you won't be disappointded. It's a quick read.

B000IZJZLM|5.0|Il Divo is one of my favorite groups.  I was able to see the song titles that were on the CD before I purchased.  Even hear a sample.  I am very happy with my purchase and will  undoubtedly buy more Il Divo albums.
B00139W3NE|1.0|OK, for starters, automatic one star off for any movie with CGI talking animals. I've always believed that the ability to make animal's lips move does not preclude the need for good storytelling. And this movie has attention-deficit storytelling. This thing jumps all over the place. Since this film is aimed squarely at youth, it leaves little question as to the origin of \\"Attention Deficit Disorder\\" in kids. But then, the drug companies makes millions selling a drug to pill-craving Americans to \\"cure\\" it, so everyone is happy, but that's another story. Every third scene in this film pauses to lay additional foundation ahead of the film before they have even solidly established where they currently are in the story. A movie that has to constantly explain itself as it goes along is a big tip-off that it doesn't know what it wants to be, or is trying to be too much but doesn't have a clue to how to manage it in two hours. By the one hour mark there was no promise that the movie could redeem itself; it was just going to continue going down the same tired path. So with fifty minutes left, I decided to cut my losses and turn it off. I very seldom do that, if ever. This is a perfect movie if you are an adult and want to have your intelligence insulted, or if you want your kids to grow up unable to focus on any stream of thought for more than sixty seconds.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|The DVD was in excellent shape.  Brand new.  No scratches.  Arrived within a few days of order.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I love this show! Not only did it bring back the great adventure shows like Xena and Hercules (with less cheese factor) but it is breathtaking in its location. They shoot this show in new zealand, which is apparently where they film everything nowadays, but the truly unique thing about this show is that you feel like you're really watching a movie, and not a television show. There is romance, comedy, magic, not to mention wonderfully choreographed swordfights. The storyline is very enthralling and sucks you right in, forcing you to care about the characters right from the first episode. I strongly reccommend this series, (and its literary counterparts-The Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind) it is a must have for any collection! :D
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|I am assuming everyone reading this is more than familiar with the story of \\"Halloween\\", John Carpenter's unintentional masterpiece of suspense, horror, and atmosphere.  I say unintentional because the film was made by a twentysomething John Carpenter and producer Debra Hill originally titled \\"The Babysitter Murders.\\" Made on a tiny budget, the movie became the highest grossing independent film of all time (up until recently) and agruably the most oft replicated movie until this day, generating sequels, remakes, and launching the careers of many actors (Jamie Lee Curtis, PJ Soles, among others)  \\"Halloween\\" gets the royal treatment on Bluray with this very satisfying HD transfer.  The 1080p HD master reveals unprecendented detail and repairs many of the \\"soft\\" apearing scenes with incredible detail and clarity.  The colors pop and some shots even have a 3D presence such as those where Laurie is walking home from school surrounded by the tress lining the streets and the bright orange leaves on the ground.  The sound is mixed in an Uncompressed PCM 5.1 with a Dolby Digital 5.1.  While the film will never sound like \\"Terminator Salvation', it offers crystal clear ambient and rear channel effects, crisp dialogue, and the classic music theme has never sounded better or more chlling.  This one is priced to own, and a must for fans!
0375842209|5.0|This book.   Oh, this book.  What to say about this book.    In the prologue, it promised to tell me something. And so it did.     Three reasons why I liked it:  1. It was well executed. Many people griped about the writing, the characters, the pacing, the plot, and Death's narration. I loved it all. Everything was very well done, the writing especially. Some folks called it overdone, superficial, excessively flowery and that kind of bothered me: nobody ever says that when Tolkien does it. Personally, I found the writing engrossing and magical. Zusack definitely has talent in my eyes. Reading his book reminded me of why I love to write.     About the characters, I fell in love with them all. I like stories like Cold Sassy Tree, Memoirs of a Geisha, and the Secret Life of Bees to name a few, where it's more about themes and character development than it is an action-packed plot. So, instead of focusing on the battles, this book focused on the people at home, people who made me laugh, and cry. Rather than being action-packed it was emotion-packed.  People complained a lot that the book was slow, or too long. Personally, I didn't want it to end. Most because some things, told to you by death, waited in the final chapters. And because I enjoyed reading it. And even though the book is long, it's about 500 times more interesting that the Diary of Anne Frank (I seriously cannot fathom why people like that book).     Death's narration was fitting. It's not like it was that different from having an author/unknown narrate as happens in many books. We just got a little more personal this time. Death was funny and interesting (I liked his little bolded comments splattered through the book), though perhaps not clever, since it seems like an obvious choice.    2. It was about Nazi Germany-- from a German's point of view. I am part Austrain, and a sliver of German and nothing bothers me more when people make them out to be monsters in WWII. A handful of people in power were corrupt and forced a nation down a dark path. But saying that all Germans were murders and beasts is not quite right. It's like branding all Muslims as terrorists: there are a handful of extremists that ruin the image. A lot of times, in dangerous situations people end up compromising their morals to stay alive. Maybe that's not noble, but it's human.     That spiel aside, it was nice to read about Germans who weren't being shown as monsters. The town Liesel lived in had a good mix of those who agreed, those who agreed to stay alive, and those who quietly disagreed. I found that blend rather real, since life's not exactly cookie-cutter good and evil.    3. It filled me with more emotions than I can count. As with other wartime books told from a child's perspective, like the Boy in the Stripped Pajamas, you get an honest look at what war does to people. From Liesel's eyes we got no politics or preaching. We got the facts:  a. War Kills  b. War affects everyone, on all sides  c. War is a never fair    And that's it. That's simply just it. We experience war from every kind of angle, from each person in the town that Liesel befriends or beats up. We are shown monsters and heroes, victims and cowards. As the story moves through Liesel's life, I learned to love the people she loved, and hate the people she hated. I laughed with her and felt bad with her. And when the end, oh that end, when it came, I sobbed. (And I'm not giving anything away because our lovely narrator, Death, is rather blunt about who dies before they do so.)    On the cover of my book, it said it could possibly be life changing. I've heard from so many sources that is was brilliant.     And for once, I agree. For adults, and teens, this story about a book-loving girl is a particularly blunt tale about the reality of war, and how life goes on beyond the battle field.     Maybe it didn't change my life. But Zusack and his artful storytelling did inspire me. And of all the World War II books I've read, it's definitely up there. And in fact, of all the books I've read this year, this book is without a doubt one of the best.
0061537969|5.0|Excellent example of meta-fiction, where the story is about the growing relationship between the narrator, Enzo, and the reader.   Transcendent.
0393327655|5.0|If you could prove or disprove faith-based knowledge (religious beliefs), faith would not be necessary. Nevertheless, rabid theists engage in attempts to prove, and rabid atheists engage in attempts to disprove. And predictably, they come up as empty-handed as the person referred to in the old adage, \\"You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip.\\" It's impossible, but since hope springs eternal in matters of faith, and too, there is a market for controversy that yields big bucks in book royalties, rabid theists and atheists remain engaged.<br /><br />Unlike others in the current crop of rabid atheists, Harris does not play the game of attempting to disprove faith-based knowledge--at least not in his book, The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason. In the philosophical tradition of logical positivism, he asserts instead that without the objective criterion of evidence to support faith-based knowledge, it is nothing more than fairy tale. He goes on to argue that without that objective criterion, there is no way to assess the truth of faith-based knowledge, and more often than not, the result is religious fascism. Incidences of Christian and Muslim fascism are cited.<br /><br />Harris argues that tolerance of diversity merely perpetuates the problem. His solution is to put an end the use of faith as a legitimate basis for knowledge. He does not explain how he would implement his solution, but it reeks of trading religious fascism for antireligious fascism.<br /><br />Given my foregoing review of Harris's book, my five-star recommendation may raise a few eyebrows. Let me explain: I enjoyed reading the book. I find the writings of rabid atheists and theists alike interesting and provocative, and I get a kick out of their attempts to out-assert each other with their faith-based views and pass them off as rational thought. (This review is also published on frankzahn(dot)com.)
0684857219|5.0|This book is extremely helpful for anyone looking at bodybuilding or even just getting into shape.  The amount of information in this book is incredible, yet easy to follow and absorb.  I have been exercising regularly and improving my body for about a year now and have read hundreds of articles and seen dozens of videos, I thought I knew just about everything until I read this book.  So whether you're a hardcore bodybuilder or just trying to look good at any age, I would highly recommend this book and the abundance of information it contains.
B001AQT0ZO|4.0|This is the Leo DiCaprio / Claire Danes \\"RnJ\\" - a zippy, clever, & brutal rendition of Shakespeare's most popular play!  There's much to appreciate in this tour de force; everyone's firing on all cylinders, thanks to Baz's scintillating, effervescent direction.  Keep your sunglasses handy; things can get blinding from time to time...
B000007492|3.0|I enjoyed this CD there are some great songs on it that I knew and wanted to hear again, like \\"It's raining again\\". However the songs on the album that I hadn't heard before were a little flat and I was disappointed. Perhaps after a few more plays they'll grow on me.
0061777250|5.0|The explanations of Dr. van Lommel's conclusions are very well organized and presented.  He gives credit to many other researchers and encourages continued research in this field.  His own research project, carried on over 20 years, seems to have been very painstakingly done.  This book leaves me hopeful and believing that we have much more to learn. I got lost in many of the technical sections, but I intend to reread \\"Consciousness Beyond LIfe\\" many more times and add it to any knowledge that I can obtain from all sources.  I like that he says \\"In my opinion\\" and \\"I lean toward this conclusion\\", but when he believes that evidence is undisputable he questions how it could be otherwise.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|When I first seen this set and I thought that it was nice that they decided to put the 2 movies together in a set.  There was a little more than I thought amongst this set, not only you get 2 movies, but you get a little booklet taking you on the inside of the first movie which I think was nice to have a little extra insight on the first movie.  The first movie to me, will always be the one that I remember as the funniest one of the these movies, while some of the bonus stuff on the DVD on how they went about making the movie was interesting.  Though it looks like that a couple parts of the movie used CG, though that it wasn't as advanced as it is these days, but it's still nice to see how just the smallest can make certain things look good in the end.<br /><br />As for the second movie, it was good but I think that they tried taking what the first one did and make it better though it was good overall.  Although it didn't seem to have some of the stuff that made the first movie so memorable while at the same time we have a new force that the Ghostbusters have to deal with after being out of business for a while now.  As for the extras for the second movie there aren't really many extras for the DVD for the 2nd movie in this set except a couple of animated episodes of the cartoon.  That is nice and both episodes made some kind of reference to the movie that came before it, though the first episode was more of the events that happened after the first movie.  Overall I give this set 4 stars out of 5.
B001PPLJIQ|1.0|Germans in the public gallery never ever shouted, \\"Nazi whore!\\" (or 'Nazi' anything else) during any of the trials in Germany of concentration guards. Give us a break! I can't believe they were able to slip that one into the movie without someone noticing it's pure fantasy. Beware of the propagandists with their not-so-hidden agendas! Also, it's an absolutely terrible and ridiculous film from beginning to end.
0307454541|5.0|I've just finished reading The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo and I couldn't put it down until I finished it.<br />This is a story about a once respected financial journalist who is enlisted by a wealthy Swedish industrialist, who is receiving a pressed flower every year on his birthday and he feels that this is a message that has to do with his long lost Great Niece who disappeared over four decades ago.<br /><br />Mikael Blomvist and a young computer genius Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood multi-tatooed and multi- pierced computer nerd together explore the decades old disappearance. The two become inseparable as they uncover a festering nest of family corruption in the Swedish industrialist's family.<br />This is the first book by Stieg Larsson, an author who died before he could fulfill his potential after only writing three great books. If you like The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo then be sure to order The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest and The Girl Who Played With Fire. I plan on reading the last two books this summer slowly. I want to savor the experience of being with this gifted author who left us to soon. Reviewed by Virginia Degner, Author of Without Consent, due to be released this fall by Eloquent books.
B003JIPJRE|2.0|1)Story :  Even though the concept is lifted from the books, it is still good to see animated.    2)Animation: The animation is average.  For some reason it zooms in on the eyes when people are talking lots of the time.  I don't know if that is the \\"Style\\" or they were lazy with animating speaking mouths.  The backgrounds and vehicles show no style and are poorly done.    3)Voicing :  For voicing ranged from average to bad.  The joker voice was horrible and was one of the 1st ones you get.  With such proven joker voices out there, I fail to see why they went so poorly.    Total: 2 bads points and 1 neutral to good item IMHO.

B0012CJQY6|5.0|My excuse for not having seen this series before now is twofold.  First, although I try to keep up with between thirty-five and fifty television series each year (I have to watch that many for my specific scholarly and academic interests and writing), it simply isn't possible to see everything, not even everything that you know is supposed to be good.  Second, I hate cop shows.  I mean, I despise them.  I especially hate procedurals and because I loathe them so utterly I tend to avoid some shows simply because, like procedurals, they have cops in them.  With regard to the first, each summer I try to catch up on shows from the past that I have wanted to see, and with regard to the second I sometimes just make myself watch shows even though the genre doesn't interest me in the least.  I'm delighted to say that I really loved this show despite the presence of cops.<br /><br />What sets this show apart is the writing.  Good writing is not tied to a particular genre.  Some of the best written shows that I've seen in the past decade or so would include MAD MEN, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, DEADWOOD, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  This is an exceptionally diverse group of shows.  What I love about THE SHIELD is the way that they throw so many strong, exceptionally complex characters into one another's faces.  There is a great line from the film THE LADY EVE, in which Barbara Stanwyck's character tells a guy that the good girls are never as bad as they seem to be and the bad ones are never as bad.  That is true here.  No cop would seem to be more \\"bad\\" than Vic Mackey, but he is capable of some shocking displays of humanity and compassion.  He is impossible to predict.  And that ends up being true of just about every character on the show.<br /><br />If, unlike me, you love cop shows, you've probably already seen this.  But if you are a fellow hater of cop and crimes shows, don't let that keep you from watching this.  If you love quality television, you are almost certainly going to love this.oing to love this.
0375713751|4.0|\\"I Don't Know How She Does It\\" to working mothers is what \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" was to single girls everywhere. It takes an unvarnished look at the ups and downs of trying to manage a successful career, motherhood, and marriage - all with varying levels of success.     The story is told from the point of view of Kate, a successful thirty-five-year-old finance executive living in London with her architect-husband and two kids. As a mother of two, the primary breadwinner, and working in finance, I could relate to Kate's situation on a very personal level. There are many details that made me alternate between laughing out loud and cringing with recognition.  Themes of work-life balance (or IMbalance as the case may be), marital tension, infidelity (of the heart and body) were brought into sharp contrast with an engaging and witty style that made it hard to put the book down.     While many can identify with Kate's character, she is also far from perfect. The title of the book is meant to be ironic, because while desperately trying to \\"do it all\\", Kate fails miserably at almost everything in her life (except, perhaps, her job - where she succeeds almost in spite of herself). What made the book and her character particularly sad for me is her insistence on there being only two choices in life: having a successful career or giving it all up to be a stay-at-home mom. Work-life balance is not all-or-nothing proposition; there are ways to be fulfilled in one's career while still making it home in time for dinner, but they involve tradeoffs and choices (e.g.  changing jobs, reprioritizing the to-do list) that the heroine seems unwilling or unable to make.    Despite the shortcomings, I still recommend this book (hence, a four-star rating) as an entertaining read-slash-cautionary tale for any woman that thinks that she can \\"have it all\\". Yes, the ending is somewhat unrealistic, but taken as a whole, the book does shed a light on the very real challenges that every working mother has faced.

B000TTRGUE|4.0|I'm not an audiophile that's building a cutting edge studio or putting on world class events.  I'm building a simple home music room and buying equipment that could easily translate to gig use (i.e. good quality, but not so expensive that I'd cry over breaking it).  Given those criteria, these mics fit the bill nicely.  I've been told that Shure mics would provide better quality, but for the price difference I couldn't justify testing that advice.  I'm satisfied with my purchase.

0545123283|3.0|I really loved Shiver, so I was super excited to hear about the sequel Linger. To be honest, Linger did not meet my expectations. First of all there are 4 points of views in this book; Grace, Sam, Isabel and a new wolf Cole. I really loved the connection that Grace and Sam had in Shiver, but i felt their connection was cut short in this one because of the other 2 points of view. With that being said, I got a little bit of that back with the interactions between Cole and Isabel and I wished we could have gotten a little more of them together than what we did. The book was really slow at times, then the pace would pick up, and then slow down again which kinda frustrated me. The reason why I didn't give this book 5 stars was the ending...I was like W-T-F...the whole book built u up for something big and then just left u cold..OF COURSE THERES GONNA BE A SEQUEL how could there not be after that ending, I just hope we get a little closure in the third book and possibly a happy ending!!!!

What an awesome album! What a range of musical styles!  Original and fresh.  It is hard to put it into words, but there is something for everyone on this album.  Dance, energetic, slow, classical, soulful, retro, trippy, rock, you name it, it is all there and it flows!  Listen from beginning to end and you can feel the story.  My new favorite album of the year, if not the past 5 years!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I'm not normally a big Tom Cruise fan. This movie was on cable a while ago, and I caught part of it. It was so good that I immediately ordered it on Amazon.<br />Tom Cruise makes a great cold-blooded killer who is arrogant and charming, yet occasionally very human. Jamie Foxx is excellent as his unwilling partner, a cabbie with unfulfilled dreams of  success. The L.A. scenery is used very well as the backdrop for the criminal activity. There is a wonderfully choreographed nightclub scene that is a sort of ballet of violence. The end comes almost too soon, always a sign that it's a good movie. One of the best crime dramas of this millenium, so far !
0307592839|4.0|This compelling new novel from Jennifer Egan paints visual images for the reader, scanning the lives of musicians and assistants, from the past to the present; she also gives us glimpses of the future as we follow along in the moments.<br /><br />Bennie Salazar and Sasha are the centerpiece characters in this tale.  Their lives in the music business carry them from San Francisco, to Naples, and to New York; the time period shifts from the 1970s to the present day or possibly some time in the future.  At the conclusion, the actual time period seems unclear.<br /><br />We see how the lives of these artists can spin out of control, as exemplified by one Scotty, who is talented and gifted and, in the end, has almost completely slipped off the grid.  He is totally a member of the \\"goon squad.\\"<br /><br />Throughout [[ASIN:0307592839 A Visit from the Goon Squad]], I felt a kind of disorientation...the constant shifting of perspectives was disconcerting at times.  First person narrative, third person point of view; it took constant alertness and readjusting of my own perspective to stay attuned to what was happening.<br /><br />Sometimes I would think...now who is this person?  And then it would slowly become clear.  Like the character Alex, in a moment when he is remembering bits and pieces of past events, expressed in this way:<br /><br />\\"Alex looked up at the building, sooty against the lavender sky, and experienced a hot-cold flash of recognition, a shiver of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, as if he were returning to a place that no longer existed....\\"<br /><br />This book made me think of real-life connections, and how our lives intersect with many people in this journey; sometimes, just when we've forgotten them, something will recall them for us.<br /><br />It was sometimes difficult to read this book, which was compelling and haunting and a bit disturbing.  There was one section in the book that was filled with word diagrams instead of regular prose...several pages of them.  I found this style to be disruptive, and because of this aspect of the book, I am deducting one star.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a four star read is a book that I recommend, especially for fans of Egan..

0439023491|5.0|[SPOILERS AHEAD]<br />I just finished the last page, and am intensely eager to get my hands on the next and final installment of this trilogy.  I was a bit bored by the beginning, and I still feel some of it could have been cut down, but the Games this book were even more exciting than the last, which is why I have to give it 5 stars.  (I actually liked the non-Games part of the first book, but didn't like the Games as much.)<br /><br />Especially the characters--they were much more developed than in the last, and I found myself rooting for a lot of them.  Also, I think the ending is a much better lead-in to the last book than the first was to this one.  I mean, yes--cliffhangers suck.  I guess I'm just lucky I held off on reading it for so long, so my wait time is only a month!<br /><br />I really want to see what District 13 will be like, and the rescue mission to get Peeta back.  This book amazed me at the cleverness of the scenarios Collins set up, and I can only hope that the next will do the same.  (I mean, who saw that ending coming?  Not me.)  I had hoped last book that they would introduce more of an element of Capitol rebellion, but in retrospect I am very glad she waited.  I think the pacing is perfect, and the game is all set.  We'll see just how many pieces remain intact by the end; with this series, there's guaranteed to be a lot of bloodshed either way.

0143113100|5.0|This book is an excellent balance to the current ideas that your brain is hardwired to do this or that, that your life has been determined by your childhood or class or race or gender. It is a beacon of hope for many with handicaps, brains that tend to be obsessive or depressed or aging. The caveat is that there is a lot of work involved. While the brain can change, it does have established pathways that can be quite strong. So, the good news is that we are not victims of circumstances or fate; the bad news is that it takes a huge effort and lots of support. A couple of  things bothered a bit:  1. While I don't endorse animal extremists like PETA, some of the animal experiments made me wince.  2. The chapter on psychoanalysis over several years may be an example of how the brain can be changed with the help of others, but the cost would be out of reach for all but the wealthy.
B00008CLRN|1.0|Hey folks, howz it goin' thiz tonite LOLZ! I'm a HUGE fan of metal.. i absolutely LOVE Korn, Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, Atreyu, Slipknot, and Nickleback... but lately i've noticed the big trend of all those old black/death metal bands trying to act like THEY created a genre better than nu-metal and metalcore. Get real folks, if black metal or viking metal was any good, MTV would play it! I never heard of Bathory before last week because they haven't been on MTV so I decided to listen to this album... and what a mistake that was! You can't even understand the vocalist! the guitar and drum work sounds like 5 year olds made the album... and the lyrics don't ever include topics like love, breakups, or high school drama!!!!! Whats a song without talking about falling in love or breaking up with your lover!!!    For REAL metal people...stick with Limp Bizkit or get the new KoRn album..... and remember to avoid stupid metal that doesnt make sense!!!!!! [Venom, Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Morbid Angel,etc...]
B002ZG983M|5.0|This surprised the hell out of me! Just like the other Writer's here, I was expecting a \\"lame\\" teenager type movie--DAM! Glad this movie corrected me! Or should I say Chloe Moretz corrected me! If you all look at the cover of the DVD, and see her picure with that \\"snarl\\" ----I just loved this movie! When I was younger, about these Kid's age, I had the \\"fantasy\\" of being Iron Man or Batman or Greenhornet! After seeing this -HELL no. You know, if you're even entertaining the idea of being a vigiliant(sorry, my spelling is atrocious here) at least have some Martial Art's knowledge-some Tech Know-How, some kind of \\"Edge,\\" But, watch this Movie first! The poor Kid who makes His choice to be a \\"SuperHero\\" almost gets his ass killed! This other Kid, whose Dad is a feared Mob Boss, wants to get in the spotlight also don's the SuperHero garb! The Dad, who is for \\"real\\" (in the movie) an ex-cop out for retribution, and of course, his little daughter when you see her she looks just like any other Kid her age and you go \\"AWW, How Cute!\\" That impression stops after you see what she can do------Yeah, I can not wait for the Sequel and Yes, I agree that Moretz will be the New Jolie (action-AngelinaJ)! And Parents, Yeah, there is a scene that is disturbing (Gage and Moretz in the junk yard) but keep in all this is for one purpose- to Entertain! O God I was laffing my ass off after seeing Moretz go in \\"Ginsu\\" Mode and her effective use of \\"selective\\" language!
B00005YUBL|5.0|Sawallisch and the Dresdeners offer timeless, landmark performances.  Vigorous and full forced without being over-blown the performances maintain spontaneity without overdriven tempos.  That Symphony 1, 4 and the Overture/Scherzo is on one disc makes for a extraordinary value.  Compare the flavorless DG set of Karajan or the ill-mannered Berstein set on DG with the VPO and you'll cherish these discs.  Expect nothing better in your lifetime.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I just saw this movie on the Big Screen, Thankfully before it disappears! Real Quickly-the theater that I went to puts it's previously Summer Release Movies in the Smaller Theater (speaking a Mega-Plix 10 Theater) room. I can tell the economy is affecting because I  like to sit at the top-they took those seats out. Okay, I'm sitting there, theater actually fills up with people, I thought I was going to be the only one there. Movie Starts, and from the first scene of Adrian \\"FreeFall\\" Brody, everyone in the audience is all of a sudden Glued to the Screen. When a movie grabs your attention, like someone grabbing you by both ears and kind'a makes you focus ON them, I just hope they continue this franchise! They had the Soundtrack, music, tension, the Stylized Machete's, \\"Ol-PainLess,\\" to make a Homage to the Original! When I first noticed-Adrian Brody!??--Acclaimed \\"Pianest\\" (bad spelling-sorry again), but after watching him in this----He's good! Alice Braga? DAM-Yow! HOT--(Sonia's Daughter?) Topher Grace?!! \\"That '70's Show\\" dude! O come on-------until near the end of this movie-------Lawrence Fishburne-Great Here! The others are all equally excellent in their (some short) \\"hunted\\" roles! To the other \\"AVP\\" movies-I loved them! Hope whoever can continue those! AVP Requiem, if you don't have an LCD-LED/HD TV system, will appear too-dam-dark! I loved this in particular because when 2 of the Universe's Most Volitile Life Forms Meet on a Meat Planet like this one, It should be just as Graphic as that Movie Showed it, even worse! -----------Pure Fun and Entertainment! Pure Escapism! I'll be getting LED/BlueRay to do all these fine Cultural Films Justice to watch! I love this Franchise since Arnold's movie and I do hope-please keep up with the gore, that is what the Predator, Alien and AVP Franchise is all about! Please keep the PG-13 rating out of this-these movies should only be R or M rated! Or F rated-for FUN! later!
B0015ABRE2|4.0|*THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br /><br />The plots this season were more all over the map than in previous years. That's not to say \\"Dexter\\" has become stale--it hasn't.<br /><br />After their rocky relationship in Season Two, Dexter and Rita get back together and he eventually pops the question. In the episodes leading up to the wedding, he sometimes questions his ability to be a good husband and parent, but in the Season Finale, a conversation with Harry and certain desperate circumstances convince Dexter he is more than ready and willing to be a family man.<br /><br />Deb gets a new partner in the cocky but twitchy Quinn, who gives off suspicious vibes for most of the season. Deb jeopardizes her chances of finally getting her shield by sleeping with Quinn's Criminal Informant. Again, things in the romance department don't turn out easy for her. There is a nice scene between her and Dexter as the wedding day approaches and Dex asks her to stand up for him.<br /><br />With Doakes out of the picture, Angel gets promoted AND gets a girlfriend. The latter comes about through some rather unusual circumstances.<br /><br />Masuka isn't used nearly enough, and his big moment of the season comes in taking charge of the preparations for Dexter's bachelor party.<br /><br />But Season Three isn't all about love and marriage.<br /><br />Dexter's first kill of the season goes awry and he inadvertently ends up offing the kid brother of District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), who becomes the pivotal figure in Dex's life this 'go-round.<br /><br />At first Dexter feels uncomfortable getting close and being pals with the man who's kid brother he murdered. But soon he relishes having his first real friend and the two bond until slowly Miguel discovers Dexter's tendencies and beliefs. It seems they are not so different from his own and he wants Dexter to become his partner in carrying out their special brand of justice.<br /><br />By mid-season, Dexter realizes that Prado is even more blood-thirsty for justice than Dexter himself. Things begin to unravel in many ways once Dexter ceases to uphold \\"The Code\\".<br /><br />The flashbacks with Harry are almost non-existent this season. Instead we see him pop up when Dexter needs his advice (I didn't care for the blurry filming technique they employed for this). Most of it is to warn and scold him about getting too close to Miguel, advice Dexter chooses to ignore until it's too late to tame the monster he helped create.<br /><br />A serial killer known as The Skinner who keeps his victims under surveillance while tree-trimming is one of the continuing threads this season. However, this storyline did not have the same impact as the Ice Truck Killer or Bay Harbour Butcher of previous seasons, probably because Dexter really has no direct link with The Skinner. This diminishes some of the impact and suspense.<br /><br />Kudos to Lauren Velez for bringing more layers to the complex role of Maria Laguerta. For a character I absoutely hated in the first half of Season One, she has come to be one of my favorites. During Season Three, Maria's loyalties are really put to the test, as is her trust. And despite her bad treatment of Deb in the past, there is a terrific moment at the end of the season that totally exonerates her.<br /><br />Another good thing about this season is that Rita finally gets a backbone, making for a better character. But as the wedding approaches, Dexter discovers Rita, too, is hiding a secret about her past.<br /><br />In conclusion, I will say this season went down much smoother and quicker than the first two. I was shocked when I put in the fourth disc to find we were already up to the Season Finale. So much had happened and at the same time it seemed like not enough had happened.<br /><br />I will say that this is still my favorite current show along with \\"Weeds\\" and \\"Desperate Housewives\\", though both of those are starting to show their age. Thankfully, so far \\"Dexter\\" has not.<br /><br />I appreciated having bonus episodes of \\"United States of Tara\\" on this set. It looks interesting and I may spring for that set if I find it on sale.s not.<br /><br />I appreciated having bonus episodes of \\"United States of Tara\\" on this set.

1597801585|5.0|I have seen many \\"reviewer quotes\\" for movies and books and never believed any of them, but they all are true for this book.  Only Tolkien has kept me so entranced at a fully-realized world, and this one hits much closer to home since it is a fully possible future.  There are no heroes, just complex people in a complex world, some more evil than others.  And yet there is hope, hope that the people of this world can rise from the ashes of corporate greed and environmental collapse, using technology to save themselves from the horrors wrought by technology and human nature.  Get it, read it, remember to breathe from time to time.

B0036EH3XE|4.0|When I was looking to purchase the LOST: Final Season DVD, I was shocked to see how divided the rating on this was. For anyone interested in giving the season a go, do yourself a favor and don't base your decision on 125 random people who can log in and type whatever crap they like. I'm not saying everyone who was disappointed in the show is typing crap. However, for anyone interested - keep in mind that the general vibe from critics and fans alike is that the show as a whole ended in a satisfying way. I'm not just saying that because I am a fan. If you do some research out there off of Amazon (metacritic as one example), you'll soon realize that Lost has a lot to offer. Of course, try to avoid spoilers if you are interested in giving this show a watch because you'll want to go in without answers like the rest of us.    Always start at season one. I think if you start there and anticipate from the beginning that not every mystery is going to be explained (though the majority are either answered explicitly or implicitly), you'll most liking be blown away like I was. If you are the kind of person who wants 20 minutes of exposition and explanation, you might want to look elsewhere. This is a personal thing and I don't blame anyone for not liking LOST if they want everything wrapped up in the end.    Another thing to consider when getting into Lost is that this show is very spiritual and philosophical, assuming a higher power is present in the lives of the survivors from season one. For many, the religious nature of the show was fine as long as it was kept in the background. When it became more prominent as the seasons progressed, some felt it was a cop-out. If you find shows that are religious to be a turn off, Lost isn't for you. However, it was a fresh take on something most people share. And it was done without becoming corny or absurd. At least in my opinion.    For me personally, Lost's final season was messy and rough around the edges for a couple of episodes. Acting was fantastic and reached new heights with Matthew Fox and Terry O'Quinn, but the plot had a hard time coming in for a landing. However, after \\"Happily Ever After\\" LOST delivered some of the best moments on TV. In the end it was always about \\"live together, die alone\\". About characters and relationships. About fathers and sons. It was about faith, religion, science, doubt, redemption, mystery, and above all: love. These aren't ordinary themes you deal with on TV. Other shows attempt to pretend to delved into huge topics, but I think LOST really took itself and the topics it addresses very seriously. It juggled some serious philosophical and metaphysical things, but never forced itself to be preachy or cheesy. I know I am just another opinion among others - and I still hold to my opening statement about not allowing a handful of people with a computer to tell you what to think about LOST - but I hold it up as one of the most amazing, emotional and mind-boggling experiences on television. The conclusion could not have been delivered better.
B003X9W98G|1.0|I really, really wanted to like this.  Seasons one thru four were...amazing, memerizing, wonderful!..and I was hoping for more.  But, please.  This year has been uneven, scattered, flat...no worse but no better than any standard tv program.  Disappointing.    I wanted to like Matt and to give him a chance but either he is the most two dimensional actor in town or else the series needs a new Director, stat.  What happened?  Did all the good writers and staff get jobs someplace else?  Was there some choice at the Production level to take this to the level of a cartoon series?    I bought all episodes on instant view, but will delete them off of my computer:  there are far better uses for that space.  What a waste of my time.    If any of you want to watch something that is still amazing, check out Being Human, which has the actor who played Alonzo Frame in it.
B000JQU1VS|1.0|I had finished reading this edition before I realized it was incomplete. The Bedford Park edition [[ASIN:B003A03RRU The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection]], with attractive cover illustration of London Bridge, is a much better edition overall, with proper formatting of numbers, and contains all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and novels.  It was extremely annoying to encounter strange symbols every time a number is mentioned, and to be forced to decipher badly-formatted html to figure out what number was being stated. Also, a variety of line breaks in the wrong places were very frustrating.   This edition is simply not worth trying to save $0.99.
0316069906|5.0|I was aware of the gruesome details of factory farming and tried to make myself watch Earth without passing out so this book isn't really groundbreaking. It does put a different spin on it because it raises the question of finding other sources of food beside the 'products' of factory farming. There were several times in the book where I did feel sick, especially when coming across a receipe that asks for a 'medium-size dog' and the unimaginable cruelty to animals at the hog farms. Those mental images will haunt me for some time. . .<br /><br />What I really enjoyed about this is how Jonathan connects the dots of the spanish influenza, the avian and pig flu and the fact 1/3 of the land is occupied by factory farms, spewing deadly viruses into the environment. As well as learning that when you buy poultry up to 10% of it is actually water! I am allergic to chicken, and I can see clearly why my body is rejecting that source of food.<br /><br />In a way its depressing reading about this subject, because you know how busy are those big-box grocery stores, that sell food raised that way. Will any of the people ever care to know about it? Will any of the people actually care, not only about their health but about how this whole crazy process is destroying the environment? I doubt it, most of the low-middle income shoppers the Buy-Low Foods wants food as cheap as possible.

0385523904|5.0|I became interested in North Korea after a short documentary I watched. Nothing to Envy was an excellent read. It was so fascinating and unbiased and filled with detail that I read it in a little over a day. The author does an excellent job at showing the many sides of people and how they can evolve over time. What is happening in North Korea is a tragedy. Hopefully as more people become interested in the country, change will happen a little quicker for the victims of the NK regime.

I would tell Amazon of the mistake but not sure how.<br /><br />ok Most of the reviews are what I would say as well.  I just want to add at one point in my life this was written about me. The moodiness the feelings it conveys all felt like it was being written about me as I listened to each song.<br /><br />Disc One is the regular disc and perfect.<br /><br />Disc 2 is what I like the most having been a long time Cure fan<br />you get a glimpse into the songs as they were written and see how they evolved. As a song writer myself, this is what I appreciate the most about this disc<br /><br />Disc 3 captures the Cure at their best which is live.  They capture the essences of their songs as I see it perfectly.  The Cure will never be recognized as the best musicians as they dont go for flash, they go for feeling which they do so well<br /><br />If you are a Cure fan, you already know of the original CD Disintegration and this deluxe edition is already on your shelf.<br />For casual Cure fans, this may be too much for you as the 1st Disc is really what you would probably want.  However if you really want to hear and feel how the original cd came to be, this is the perfect way to discover an amazing CD and band
0205606288|5.0|Bevington's sixth edition has more than the necessary information on the Bard's works. The line numbers that coincide with the footnotes is a definite help and makes this text easier to read and understand.
0553266306|5.0|I'm not an international spy/assassination-plot \\"blockbuster\\" reader.  I love quirky books by quirky, literary authors.  However, \\"Jackal\\" has drawn me back again and again, and I figure I must read it at least once a year year, and then find myself following up with the excellent film, to see if it depicts new things (I always find)  in the re-reading.  I'm almost finished with it again this year and I can't believe that I it feels like an entirely different, yet still fabulous, book!  That tells it's a possible  masterpiece, a work of art that never ceases to be fresh and thought-provoking. One learns so much about history, geography, guns, European automobiles, the art of disguise, how French security works at the top; Charles DeGaulle's personality;  French and British rivalry/loyalty, the OAS, the Corsican underground, etc. etc.  What separates it from other thrillers of its kind are 1.) the brilliant plot and 2.) the intricate, astute  character studies. Best of all are those of the fabulous Jackal himself, and the unprepossessing, dogged detective who never crumples under the exhausting pressure to catch a complete unknown. However, even the slightest characters are well-crafted, which is what sets this novel apart from others in its genre, which I find rather cliche'd and clumsy when it comes to assigning physical features, motives and psychological texture/depth.  If you are reading it for the first time, don't expect to do much work for the next few days, and if you are a slow reader, rejoice! This book is best stretched over time, because once you've finished it, there's really no other quite as delicious. On the other hand, you can always read it again...and again.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|More fine prose from JJ, you will notice that the percussion recedes to the background somewhat, compared to his earlier albums, allowing the melodies and words capture you first.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from movies that were made in the 70's and 80's, but I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.  These were the first movies I purchased for my Blu-ray player and the quality makes each one of them look like they were filmed yesterday.  There were a few scenes that could have been cleaned up a little more, but overall I was pretty amazed.    As far as cost, I looked at the usually, Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target, none of them were this cheap.  Plus, once you use Amazon once, they keep giving you coupons and deals that make the prices unbeatable.
B003EYVXSC|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000640VO Amelie]] and [[ASIN:B00000K3TS The City of Lost Children]] belong to those films that, although, you find strange when you sit through it for the very first time, they stay with you forever. I find the director (Jean-Pierre Jeunet) to be Europe's answer to David Lynch - only a tad heavier on the regressive images and lighter on the subconscious horrors. So when he had another film out, I was not going to miss it. And, once more, I was glad I did.<br /><br />A bunch of eccentrics (each with his or hers own quirky character and unusual personal history) come together by life's caprice and end up undertaking an impossible task: try to take down the two largest arms manufacturers in the country. Ingenious ideas, impossible retro gadgets (handmade from salvaged materials), and an unwavering sense of justice. No sacrifice is too big if it means making the villains pay for their crimes.<br /><br />The colors are soft and comforting; the imagery is mesmerizing; the music will take you back to a more naive age; and the story will make you laugh, cry and laugh again. All in all, great entertainment!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

0451169514|5.0|Let all preconceptions of this novel brought on upon by the horrid miniseries be dropped forever. This is a fantastic book. It is less about an evil clown-monster living in the sewer and more about life. About the hopes and fears of childhood, the anxieties that come with adulthood, the quirks and the nuances that stick with you your entire life. It is about racism, prejudice, abuse, kindness, friendship and human experience. It is populated by characters and emotions so spookily human it will seem as if you're reading about yourself, or at least someone you know very well.     Amidst a cloud of drugs and alcohol, King outdid himself. As bizarre and flawed as it may be, I do not think he has written a better novel since. The ending is a little out-of-place, yes, and the explanation given as to the nature of the 'It' is very strange. But the monster is less the novel's focal point and more the instigator of a vivid and very haunting display of young humanity against the towering unknown, not just externally but internally. The novel also leaves a very wrenching denoument, though it has nothing to do with clowns or werewolves or spiders. It leads you to reflect upon your own childhood, to realize how much of it has been lost in time, what happens to it as you make your way into adulthood.     For those who complain about its meandering length, they need to give it time. They need to try and appreciate this tome for its detail and not just for its scattered scenes of action and horror.     \\"IT\\" is one of those few novels I can pick up and read at almost any point in time. For me, it is one of those Very Good Books that seems more like a good friend than a pile of pages. I may have hammed things up in this review, but few books this side of Steinbeck, Hemmingway and McCarthy have ever evoked this kind of emotional response from me. Everyone should give this book a shot.

0061777250|4.0|This book covers a lot of old ground, and significant portions of it are still lodged in 80s style battles against \\"medical materialism\\": not carbon dioxide, not hypoxia, and so on. The strongest section of the book is the set of speculations on quantum nonlocality. This is not new either, it has to be said, as speculations pertaining to consciousness being rooted in nonlocality have been around for a long time now. Still, it might actually be *true* that this is the case, and that there is some (perhaps very simple or primordial) form of \\"consciousness\\" that pervades all matter and thus is not \\"lost\\" as such, upon death of an organism. The problem arises in defining what sponsors this nonlocality. Neurons are not a serious candidate because of decoherence, and tubulin dimers definitely have their supporters and their critics.    I'd have to say though that this by itself doesn't worry me too much. Consciousness is the most subtle behavior of nature. It doesn't seem that unlikely that it partakes of another of nature's great subtleties...quantum principles of nonlocality...in order to exist, and if we haven't ironed out the details yet, well, that's our problem, not nature's. The symmetry in nature, the coherent expression of organic systems. There's something not quite plausible about all this being sponsored only by Newtonian collisions. Nonlocality may not \\"explain\\" consciousness, but it may at least be the domain in which it exerts its influences.    If the High Tales of unusual perceptions in the OR are really so, it may actually be true that some form of mind or consciousness of the dying person survives, at least for a little while.    And there's the rub. A little while. For if we take the thesis seriously, there is another side to its coin, and that is that the people undergoing NDEs aren't really \\"dead\\". They are at the very beginning of a \\"death process\\". If not just consciousness, but \\"life process and structure\\" is all an expression or symptom of thisspeculated quantum nonlocality, then it is clear that their organic systems are still \\"mostly alive\\" by this definition, even if the cortex is not functioning. We are in uncharted terrain here, and it behooves us to be cautious. For my own part, should survival not be permanent, I would question whether hanging around for a few hours after brain shutdown isn't actually worse than simple death. I guess we must hope that isn't the case, but the fact is that *most* unusual phenomena associated with death are in that time bracket.    It is for this reason, among others, that I think we must draw a distinction between the bare *possibility* of a nonlocal consciousness unmasked at death, and the supposed *contents* of that consciousness as allegedly displayed by the NDE. The latter do not follow from the former. Indeed, many \\"truths\\" stated in near death experience are in simple opposition to what we observe in nature. Our natural desires for an uber-parent, for the universe to be \\"moral\\", for our lives to be planned with purpose and so on, all find their place within the NDE in the form of \\"life reviews\\", contracts made before birth, and so on. It all seems just a bit too suspiciously like our own idea of an idealized or utopianized form of life rising to meet us from our own unconscious. This is a huge question about these experiences that is not being sufficiently addressed in books like this, and even though this book is better than many and certainly superior to recent publications in this field, it still spends too much of its time battling medical materialism.     The really rich, interesting questions about NDEs fall out into two areas. First, the whiff of a nonlocal consciousness of some sort expressible when the brain really shouldn't be functioning. Second, the origin of the content in NDEs. Again, the questions that are  not being asked relate to our capacity as a race with mythopoeic capability. Myth is our most ancient response to the problem of existence.It has been with us, has shaped our very brains and minds, since the days of earliest man. You could be forgiven for thinking, reading some of these books, that the earliest event of any significance to the subject was when Raymond Moody coined the term Near Death Experience in 1975!    All in though, it seems that there may be something here. It probably isn't what we think it is (in literal terms), but any form of consciousness whatsoever that could express itself nonlocally through distributed systems, should it prove to be so, will eventually be enough to shake a nervous paradigm to its roots.
0385737947|4.0|Great story.. Chracters were likable, there were lots of twists..I really liked the creation/use of new slang (like 'Shuck' & 'Klunk').. The reality is, if there really was a society only populated by teen boys, cursing seems pretty inevitable and it was nice to Not have to read the F word every few sentence.. so Thank You, Mr Dashner for that!.. I'm really looking forward to the books that follow.
B001AQMBL4|5.0|A great comedy. Plenty of great scenes with a wonderful fraternity pledge-Blue! Cast did a super job and it moves fast. Very enjoyable and a true classic. Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn have comedic chemistry that drives a laugh a minute.
B001U0HBPQ|4.0|It's extremely rare these days to watch a movie with exceptional special effects that actually offers a well executed storyline, which is what I discovered about the actual movie. Actors took a strong hold of their respective roles and made you a believer.<br /><br />The second disc was of special interest to me because I am always curious about the \\"behind the scenes\\" extras and \\"making of\\" documentaries. This 2 disc edition did not disappoint me.
B001FB55I0|5.0|Wow, Terminator Salvation is actually a really exciting movie!  I went in already a big fan of the original three Terminator films, but Terminator Salvation really does a fantastic job continuing with the series.       It's not a secondrate or cheesy attempt in comparison to the previous three Terminator films either- it's actually really darn good.    I admit I mostly like the Terminator films because, well first of all, they are action-packed in a way that's pretty easy to understand and follow.  I simply *enjoy* them.  I know what's going on.  It's not science fiction created in a completely confusing way.  The storyline is what it is- machines are designed to kill humans and take over the world.    Secondly, I feel a LOT of tension whenever I think about humans trying to run away from an enormous, dangerous machine created for the sole purpose of destroying anybody that moves.  I can't tell you how many dreams I've had where I was running and hiding as much as I could ONLY for a huge machine to suddenly show up and force me to continue running.  I love it!    As for Terminator Salvation, there's some really cool additions to the machine creatures.  I really fell in love with the robot snakes (as I like to call them, hehe).  They are actually huge metal claws that hide in the water.       Also, let's not forget the scene out in the desert with that HUGE machine that actually has motorcycles stored as a last resort inside his legs (I kid you not!).   Apparently whenever someone is out of shooting distance for this particular machine, he opens up his legs and sends machines on motorcycles after them.  Awesome!    The storyline is typical affair however.  You *know* what to expect.  There's nothing especially hard to grasp about what's taking place.      Overall, with todays technology and the way Hollywood delivers action flicks these days, the action scenes involving the robots going ballistic is just incredible and seems more believable now than it did in years past.  The same remains true here.  Great movie.
B002WE473I|5.0|I saw the movie first, enjoyed it very much, so I thought I would check out the book.  As is often the case, the book delivers even more than what can be captured in a 2 hour movie.  In the book the author includes the insights of many more people than the story line developed for the movie.  You get to read how key previous Apartheid government officials, ANC officials, notable South Africans, those around Nelson Mandela, etc reacted and what they thought about Nelson Mandela, the Springboks, and the Rugby World Cup in that magical year.  It is a truly inspiring portrayal about a single person who could overcome adversity, persecution, and mistreatment and yet had the capacity to forgive those who did this to him and work with them to create a new united and peaceful nation.  There are many reasons to read this book that range from inspiration, education, to self-improvement.
B000002KP3|4.0|Even after all these years, I STILL don't believe Electric Warrior is anywhere in the same league as the Slider.      The Slider offers better songwriting, a grittier and heavier sound, and arguably a more diverse offering.       In comparison, Electric Warrior features barely above average songwriting, light orchestration in replacement of heavy out all rock and roll, and a pretty repetitive formula overall.    Not that I'm necessarily putting down Electric Warrior.  It just seems like many of these songs are a couple minutes overlong because they repeat the same guitar notes and vocal melodies over and OVER again.  This is especially noticeable on side one.      I love songs like \\"Mambo Sun\\", \\"Jeepster\\", and \\"Cosmic Dancer\\", but had they been shortened a couple minutes I wouldn't be complaining about it so much.  At least the background strings help spice up the material a little bit, but still, this is nothing compared to the Slider.     The band should have juiced up their material with more in the way of choruses, bridges, guitar solos, *something* at least besides repeating the same notes over and over again.  While this formula works amazingly well on the Slider, here it just feels bland in comparison.      It also doesn't help that I NEVER got the appeal of \\"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\\".  Other songs on the album such as \\"The Motivator\\" strongly resemble that popular hit song, but done significantly better IMO.    \\"Rip Off\\" might be the angriest, coolest, most underrated track here.  I absolutely *love* this song.      Overall, Electric Warrior is good, but the problem is that the Slider gives you a better idea what the glam rock movement was all about in the early 70's.

B00000739O|5.0|Coney Island Baby is definitely a terrific album that should be getting more recognition than it has thus far.  What a shame radio stations insist on believing \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" is the only song of his that matters (though lately, thanks mainly to TV commercials, other Lou Reed favorites such as \\"Perfect Day\\" and \\"Satellites of Love\\" are getting some attention- FINALLY!)    Of course Lou Reed comes back once again with another interesting and thought-provoking display of lyrics, but the REAL meat and potatoes of Coney Island Baby is in the guitar playing.  I simply love the melodic way the guitar solos are scattered across the majority of these tunes.  \\"Kicks\\" probably has some of the best guitar work Lou Reed OR the Velent Underground ever laid down on tape.  It's THAT good!    The title song is pretty cool as well, mostly for the gentle way in which the vocal melody is sung combined with *more* of that fantastic guitar playing.  It deserves to be around 6 minutes long.    \\"She's My Best Friend\\" has a vocal melody that any Lou Reed fan will greatly appreciate.  If you like the mans style, you will surely dig this track.      Coney Island Baby is just a severely underrated album these days.  I don't know if there was ever a period in the 70's when this album was popular or what, but it sure *deserves* to be more well-known.
0156012197|1.0|I read part of this in French class in high school.  I remember wondering why we were supposed to read it.  Now as an adult, re-reading it I still wonder.  I don't really see what the hype is about.  Is it a childrens story?  Is it sad?  Hard to say.  This premise is that there is a little prince who comes to Earth and meets adults.  He finds most adults to be too interested in the day-to-day world that they live in.  He wants to go home to his planet and care for his flower ... so he uses a snake to get there.  Sound strange?  Read it and find out for yourself.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|(500) Days of Summer is a bit interesting in that it's slightly funny, slightly dramatic, and slightly interesting.  It's a little bit of everything (strong emphasis on the *little* bit part).      However, that's also the biggest flaw with the storyline- it tries to be all kinds of things, but in the end it only touches upon each of them for a short period of time.  So (500) Days of Summer ends up being just a pretty good film, but definitely not a great one.    In the beginning (like the first 20 minutes or so) you'll probably think the film will develop into the most predictable kind of love story you can imagine (and in some ways, it does).      It's about a young man who falls in love with a woman (Zooey Deschanel) that he works with, but the tricky thing is that the girl doesn't really want a relationship (or so it seems).  Instead, she just prefers to have fun and live life to its very fullest, etc, etc.  So the relationship between the two of them for the most part is all about having fun with each other like best friends normally would.    Of course this doesn't sit well with the guy who definitely wants her to be his girlfriend.  From here the storyline kicks in, and we find out this girl is actually completely whacky.  Actually, on an unrelated note, Zooey Deschanel's character is *exactly* like the way she always is in other films.  You know, the shy, offbeat and awkward personality, but that's beside the point I suppose.     Anyway, some of the storyline segments are fairly interesting such as a certain restaurant scene, a certain word the couple blurt out repeatedly at a local park picnic, and just the awkward way the man and woman communicate with each other.  It's weird, but I guess that's the point (so as not to fall for the typical love storyline we've seen thousands of times now).    So yeah, it has its moments of laughter, drama, and entertainment.  It's a pretty satisfying movie.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Wow...all I can say is that you have to watch this movie. Although a little dark (post apocalypse) and violent (in a much changed world), it shows that faith, determination, and hope still have a place. The ending is so not what you expect, the twist is great. Have watched several times. EXCELLENT.

B00000F14B|5.0|It seems that no other Broadway musical was ever transferred so intact to the screen with every facet of its production gleaming and gloriously theatrical in its staging. River City, Iowa, of course, looks no more realistic than the Land of Oz, but that's how it should be. It's satire, and thankfully director Morton DaCosta keeps it all in tip-top shape, preserved to play exactly as it did on stage, even with respect to the opening number aboard a train where all the salesmen are singing about a certain scoundrel posing as a professor of music.<br /><br />Meredith Willson's music never sounded as good and is given expert singing and dancing from ROBERT PRESTON, SHIRLEY JONES, PAUL FORD and HERMIONE GINGOLD in the leads, all of whom are aided and abetted by some of the best singing and dancing you could ask for in a musical of this kind. Gingold is outrageously funny and Paul Ford as her husband, the Mayor of River City, is equally boisterous in a comic role. But it's Preston's show from start to finish with co-star Shirley Jones in fine vocal form as the skeptical librarian.<br /><br />One of the most cleverly staged numbers is the \\"Marian, The Librarian\\" number that takes place in the town library where sliding poles and balconies become part of the intricately staged dance routine. All of the musical numbers are performed with professional charm by a talented group of actors/singers/dancers who are part of the River City citizenry.<br /><br />Little Ron Howard, the boy with the lisp, who later went on to directorial fame, is a standout as Jones' little brother.<br /><br />Summing up: Outstanding old-fashioned musical with its heart in the right place--Americana in the best tradition of the word.<br /><br />Summing up: It has more charm than the law allows.
0393072231|4.0|The book is very good at detailing the situations and characters involved in the financial mess caused by the recent housing bubble and how a few people anticipated it and bet big on it happening.<br /><br />The book starts with a quote by Tolstoy about the importance of being open-minded in order to understand complex things and being close-minded keeps someone from understanding even simple things. The author was amazed how in the mid 1980's Salomon Bros. would pay him good money, a 24 yo with no clue. Yet, he figured out then that the big money was made in the bond market not stocks, leading up to the junk bond collapse in the 80s. He then wrote about it, and here it was essentially happening all over again with the bond people. CEO's knew nothing of the risks their bond traders were taking. He hoped bright college students would avoid Wall Street, rebel against it and just pursue what they loved. But, no, the financial system would again be discredited. He then goes into these key things in this mess like:<br /><br />1. Meredith Whitney, then an obscure analyst at Oppenheimer & Co, with just a BA from Brown who studied English, said Citicorp was so mismanaged it would cut its dividend or go bust. The so-called experts were still not acknowledging the risk in the sub-prime mortgage market - not that they were corrupt, just stupid. She was trained by Steve Eisman who also gave her a world view - how to see the big picture when analyzing stuff. She read about John Paulson, a hedge fund manager, who made big bets against the bonds and there were a few others. Eisman, U. Penn and Harvard, but also yeshiva trained and loved the Talmud because of its contradictions - he had the mind set to look for investment contradictions. He saw Wall Street going where it never went before - into the debts of ordinary Americans - cash flow from pools of mortgages - the only risk back then was of borrowers paying off soon, but never not at all. So, this new market, never really tapped to such an extent, homes, and let less credit-worthy people to buy homes, but the real risk was in letting them cash out and refinance to get more money, basically a fast buck business with the issuers of the mortgages just selling them off and not caring what happened long term. Society had changed, with incomes more skewed, more wealthy and more struggling - so this was a way to let those left behind in the economy to prosper, even feel wealthy - letting them borrow easily. Oppenheimer was getting into this new market. Eisman needed Vincent Daniel, from Queens and SUNY Binghamton whose father was murdered - so different roots, to parse data. Found that delinquency rates were hidden, only profits from prepayments were visible.<br /><br />2. 1997 Russia defaulted, 2002 Eisman saw HFC was a fraud - tricking customers on interest rates, Eismain was aware of ACORN -was a Republican until he saw an entire industry, consumer finance, existed just to rip people off.<br /><br />3. By 2005, 75% subprime loans were floating rate, fixed for just 2 years. Long Beach Savings was the first to get into this, soon followed by big WS banks - run by the bond departments.<br /><br />4. In 2004, Michael Burry got into them, seeing decline in lending standards, but hard to short, then he discovered Credit Default Swaps (CDSs). Charlie Munger gave lecture about the \\"psychology of human misjudgment.\\"<br /><br />5. 2ndQ 2005, credit card delinquencies at all-time high, but home prices continued going up. Hallmark of a bubble/mania/fraud.<br /><br />6. AIG on the other side of the bet, issuing the CDSs. Goldman created the CDO and synthetic CDOs which had in them CDSs. Home prices didn't need to fall, just not go up as fast. Tom Fewings, the first in AIG to spot trouble - when seeing WSJ article on New Century. Joe Cassano, head of AIG FP didn't think home prices would fall, at least not nationally, all at once - eventually did change his mind, but still exposed. Mid 2006 home prices began to fall.<br /><br />7. FICO scores had blind spots - didn't acct. for people's income, could be rigged by getting a new credit card and paying off right away, no difference between \\"thin file\\" and \\"thick file\\" borrowers, teaser rates hid risks, averages used for pools of mortgages which hid the amount of low FICO scores of those who should never have been given mortgages, \\"silent seconds\\" allowing borrowers to have no equity in their home.<br /><br />8. Few used CDSs as outright bets against housing, most were used as hedges while still hoping for the bonds to work out. Exceptions were those who listened to Greg Lippman's pitch, like John Paulson. Paulson/Eisman/Burry understood the risk. Ledley/Hockett/Mai just bet on the least likely possibility - their strategy. Rule of thumb - buy homes when price equal or less than 10X rent and sell when 20X.<br /><br />9. Names and acronyms hid risks - CDOs not called subprime backed CDOs, but structured finance CDOs, RMBS, HEL, HELOC, ALT-As were just no-doc crappy loans, Rockridge community not called Oakland so homes would sell for more. Actually, 80 of a CDO was overrated, so even better to bet against the higher tranches, since the CDS would be cheaper but the same likelihood of default.<br /><br />10. Wing Chao, called a CDO manager, which were essentially front men for WS firms, could collect bigger salaries and imply they actually studied the CDOs.<br /><br />11. Rating agency people were underpaid- should have been paid more to attract talented people - they just made their money by collecting fees for each rating, so just pushed them through quickly. Like a Ponzi scheme - more morons than crooks, but the crooks were higher up. WS just propped up CDO prices while it could - fraud was rampant - neither the WSJ nor SEC was interested.<br /><br />12. Now Bear Stearns at risk. Merrill had advised Orange county before their bankruptcy, was in the middle of the Internet bust, 80's bond market bust, so naturally they would be in the middle of this.<br /><br />13. Jim Grant couldn't figure out CDOs then realized that was the story to be told.<br /><br />14. When Goldman got into the bet against CDOs, then CDOs began to tank. 4/2007 New Century went bankrupt. BS leverage 40:1,Lehman & ML 32:1, Morgan Stanley & Citicorp 33:1, GS 25:1. Only a slight decline could bankrupt them all. 9/2008 Lehman went bankrupt, ML $55B loss - sold to BA. WS firms were the dumb money, CEOs stupid. Bear Stearns Chioffi and Tannin arrested.<br /><br />!5. It was greed, sure, but more the incentives which channeled the greed.

0307454541|4.0|Several months after reading this book, the characters still echo in my head. It is an exciting tale, told impeccably.  I did see the movie released with subtitles, after reading the book.  It doesn't do justice to the development of the characters, but it does cut out a lot of filler material that turned out to not be important to the story line.  All in all, though, this was a sensational story, told well.
B000069HZP|5.0|Having seen 'The Game' in movie theaters, and totally enjoying it for it's suspense and intrigue I highly recommend it.  If you don't like movies that go beyond the reality of the world (i.e. stretching belief) then you'll probably despise this film for that (and stay in your box).  I haven't a problem with that, so I loved this film.    Warning: The DVD version is all that is currently available in widescreen (unless you have one of those discontinued format 'HD DVD' players).  The DVD version is double-sided, and you can play the widescreen side, but the widescreen image does not fill a 1080 screen completely (so I was not happy with that).  There are bars all-around the image (yes, right and left sides too!)  I believe that's because it was not been scaled as Anamorphic widescreen - but, for whatever reason, this is very annoying to watch on a quality widescreen TV.  I tolerate it, but would rather see it un-stretched, but made as wide as possible, sized to fill the width of my screen.    I'm sure some technophiles would praise the format of this widescreen presentation, but 'not for me'.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Inception is a 'Freudian Feast'. I love it and have seen it twice already!!    It has so many layers to it! dream states, projections, counter projection, existential themes of life, reasoning for being, the fear of death,relationship with the parents, self acceptance, loss, as in denial of it and acceptance of it- and so much more.    It's like one great big therapy session,moving back and forth on a continuum   (within each stage of the dream) until the main character, Dom Cobb,reaches his goal, despite all the obstacles he faces.    The sets, the performances, everything about this film is simply stunning.    A real mind bender of a film. I love the way Christopher Nolan has allowed us,as the viewer, to make up our own minds during the story. It's not a film that mindlessly spoon feeds its audience and definitely left me thinking for quite some time.    It definitely needs more than one viewing!    As for Leonardo Dicaprio; this along with,Shutter Island, will be my favourite film of 2010.
0061438294|5.0|Far too many books on non-verbal communication give very unrealistic accounts of what can be ascertained from watching body language. Most are gimmicky and make false promises to entice certain types of readers who are looking for ways to manipulate and supposedly gain mind-control over others. Fortunately this book is one of the few that presents a realistic picture of what non-verbal behaviours can, and cannot, reveal about another person. The author openly admits that in spite of several years working for the FBI and having an interest in reading non-verbal behaviours, even he has only a slightly above chance success in detecting deception.<br />  The author clearly lays out what to watch out for in non-verbal behaviours. Even when the observed person gives off non-verbal cues that something is amiss, the only fair conclusion is that he/she is under stress and not that he/she is trying to deceive. Mr. Navarro repeatedly points out that innocent people give off stress signals too. All these non-verbal cues indicate is that the person being observed is uncomfortable (from lying or equally so many other reasons such as being uncomfortable) and the reasons why need to be investigated further.<br />  These useful cues can be used by anyone from a police officer carrying out an investigation to a host attempting to make sure a guest is comfortable. Those looking for a way to achieve \\"mind-control\\" or to manipulate others would be better off spending their money on some serious counseling rather than on a book on non-verbal communication that will not give them what they need.<br />  As an aside, today I watched a reality television show involving a murder suspect being interviewed by police. Many of the cues mentioned in Mr. Navarro's book could be seen in the suspect. This offered support to what the author outlines in his book and also made the interview a lot more interesting to watch!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I actually only started watching Doctor Who at the beginning of this last season (I know, fail), and was so impressed by the sheer awesomeness that I went back and watched the other 4 seasons of the new Doctor Who.  I suppose that might make me a little biased since Matt Smith is \\"my\\" Doctor and I started with Moffat being the lead writer.  I adored the past seasons too (although I'm surprised even the Complete Specials has a higher rating than this, considering that it kind of sucked.  In my opinion.) but I'm a little shocked by how many people disliked the new series and Matt Smith.  I think people in general just don't like change...but that's just me.  I loved it.  So.  ...Buy it!  (Possibly on ebay or something though, since the retail prices for all Doctor Who dvd sets are ridiculous.)
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is part of a three part trilogy.  It is set in the future and the USA is dissolved and been replaced by an alternate country named Panem, which has 12 districts all extremely poor compared to the capital district.  To punish the districts for trying to revolt against the capital and to show its power over the people, the capital sponsors a tournament which selects a boy and girl from each district to compete in an all out battle to the death tournament. It's a tremendous spectacle that is broadcast to the entire nation and mandatory for them to watch.<br /><br />The two main characters Katniss, who the story is told through, and Peeta the boy also chosen from district 12, unfortunately find themselves thrown together in the Hunger Games. All the tributes have different skills they possess and challenges that they have to survive, all while attempting to kill off the other tributes and stay alive.  An interesting twist to the story presents a romantic tale that creates interesting sport for the Hunger Games viewers.  Katniss struggles with keeping herself alive, while at the same time trying to dissect and understand her emotions and feelings for those in the games separating reality from acting, all while remembering those faces she has left at home.<br /><br />Surprisingly this story is increasingly addicting. The action is intense, the resourcefulness of the characters is a lesson on survival, and the romance drama creates a interesting twist where the tributes are suppose to be killing each other not forming alliances and falling for each other.  Being set in the future, the story and details has a sci-fi feel that is awesome. It reads fast and almost has a snow-balling effect as you close in on the end, which leaves you thirsting for the next installment.
B003ELOQCU|5.0|U2 360 is awesome. Was at the concert and definitely was a night i will never forget. The super delux model is a must have for hardcore fans but the most important thing is the performance which was outstanding by the way. If you truly like music you will enjoy this.
B002WY65VU|2.0|I was very disappointed with this movie for one reason...not enough zombies!<br /><br />It starts out great and Jessee Eisenberg is a very likeable actor (he \\"made\\" Adventureland). The movie starts out great with his character's rules for dealing with a zombie culture. The problem is, that once the four main characters get together, there's too much talking and not enough zombies.<br /><br />Woody Harelson was interesting and the Bill Murray cameo was great. \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" knew how to integrate horror and comedy but this movie quickly morphed into an uninteresting \\"road movie\\" I know this is not supposed to be highbrow entertainment but I was expecting much more from this. The trailer truly shows you everything you need for this one.
B00122S4KS|4.0|I have been listening to this album for a few years and I have to say, it is definitely good. The two songs that stand out to me are Emergency and Conspiracy. I love their music and I hope they never stop singing!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Hollywood producers, repeat after me: the Blair Witch is not scary.  The Blair Witch is NOT scary.  THE BLAIR WITCH IS NOT SCARY!  If we have that thoroughly learned (next time I'll make you write it on the blackboard in front of the whole class) then maybe we can get back to making movies and avoid schlock like this in the future.  Whaddya say, hmm?<br /><br />J.J. Abrams, master of wretched excess, produces, while Matt Reeves directs.  You recall Matt Reeves, right?  Me neither.  Part of the selling point on this film was that cinematographers used cameras you could buy at Target.  Perhaps this explains why the film is as noisy, visually hectic, and nausea-inducing as the footage of my best friend's kid's sixth birthday party.<br /><br />Six intellectually vapid, morally dismal Manhattan friends gather to see one of their number off to Japan.  We get hints of sex and alcohol, but before we see anything titillating, the building vibrates and the lights flicker.  Outside in the street, the head of the Statue of Liberty rolls like a bowling ball.  Then the carnivorous monsters appear.  We only lack Sigourney Weaver.<br /><br />We never clearly see the monster.  This is fine at first; it took a while to see the Alien and the Predator, too.  But the movie drags on, and all we ever see looks like an explosion at a taxidermy shop, always in soft focus, and I wonder how they spent the reputed $30 million budget.  At least those other carnivorous creature flicks rewarded our patience with something visible.<br /><br />The creature sheds fleas, which we see a little better.  These fleas are as big as mastiffs, and if one bites you, the military shoots you in a subway tunnel.  Huh?  This movie does lots, but explains little.  Nobody but Shirley Jackson has ever been able to maintain suspense while telling us nothing.  Are you Shirley Jackson?  Well are you?  No?  Then go sit at the back of the class.<br /><br />With its human angle, its obvious evocation of 9/11, and its intellectual ambition, I think the creative team had a vision for this movie.  Sadly, they lost that vision on the way to production.  This whole film looks like it was shot to create a trailer.  It's less a movie than a concept in search of a movie.  And like the Blair Witch before it, it's not scary.  Not a bit.  It's just sloppy.team had a vision for this movie.  Sadly, they lost that vision on the way to production.

B0011Z76RS|5.0|I do not usually say an album is perfect but this was a perfect album! I loved this and I still listen, years later. The first time I heard them was when the Crawling video came out. I was half sleep and heard the haunting music come on so I woke up to watch and when I got up the next morning I had to find out who was behind the music. I think these guys are gonna be around for a while so sit back, listen and enjoy!
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Not completely about rugby as was expected and not a lot of game play actually showed.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|I had never heard of this group until my boyfriend introduced me to the music. I found their album to be so haunting and eerie that I fell in love with the album. This is a must buy!
0812550706|5.0|Since there have been in excess of 2000 reviews of this book, I cannot say much that has not already been articulated.  I am not a Sci-Fi junkie, though I have read some.  This book is simply a great story.      Some of my favorite characters in the books I have read recently have had Ender's quiet, brooding quality.  Lisbeth Salander from Stieg Larssen's books comes to mind.  It is a truly remarkable thing to create a character that you as the reader actually feel exists.  And Ender is someone that anyone who was not the bully on the playground can relate to.      This book was great, and it has that rare quality that few books have...It makes the reader want to pick it up every couple of years and read it all over again.
B00278U1W0|4.0|It was great to see these two playing together. Since I had never seen Steve Winwood live, I was pleasantly surprised to see that he also played guitar as well as keyboards. Loved every minute. I never tire of watching Eric play. So natural and talented. Nothing else needs to be said.
B003405MF6|1.0|I did not care for this new album at all. I think Jeff is pushing it. Mixing his guitar with classic orchestra or jazz arrangements seems appealing at first, but I found the overall album lacking guts and punch. It's lingering from one piece to another and totally lacks any \\"commotion\\". If you loved albums like Beckology, Jeff or Who Else, you may not like this new one. I am glad I tried, because Jeff had surprised me in the past, but I am very disappointed in this latest production.
0307454541|5.0|I love the depth to this story. It has something for the Dan Brown lover while provides a fresh taste from a European author. I also saw the film and think it was a great adaptation. I researched Stieg Larsson and saw words such as socialist and communist fill the pages of his bio. This, to me, adds another layer of mystery for this author and enhances the depth to his engrossing story. The work of Stieg Larsson, the prolific writer and gripping storyteller, will live on forever.<br /><br />- J. Sturak<br />author [[ASIN:0982589409 Clouded Rainbow]]
0439023491|5.0|This is the second book of the series, and I'm more than hooked. I can't wait for the 3rd to come out. I'm a middle school teacher, and I like to see what my students are reading. This is another series of books (like the Twilight series and the Harry Potter series)that I highly recommend to any adult. I also think it would make an excellent movie! When I read the excert of what the book was about, I thought it might be a little too depressing or something that I may not be interested in. My first instinct was way off. The books are thrillers with great and original story lines. You will fall in love with the characters. It is a must read!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters are lively, interesting, humorous and heart wrenching. Its one of those books that makes you want to move to where it happened and hope these people really exist. Its one of my new all time favorites, my only regret is that I didn't discover it sooner.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|This is a really well done action flick worth viewing. Here's what's good with it:<br /><br />1. It's full of non-stop action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The stunts and fight scenes are really exciting.<br /><br />2. The story has twisty turns and it keeps you thinking. There's no boredom here, and I felt the plot was close enough to being plausible to keep you interested. Even if the exact program of placing trained children into America isn't complete realism, we all know that there are spies living as Americans in this country. Just watch the news. It's a current and relevant theme.<br /><br />3. The acting is excellent, and the characters, especially Angelina Jolie, show depth. You can't help caring about what happens to Salt.<br /><br />While I agree with another reviewer who said that Salt's husband isn't shown a lot, I felt he was shown enough to reveal that Salt really loved him. That was what the audience needed to know in order to understand her motives, and to care about whether he lived or died.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend seeing this movie, and it's one I'd own as well.
B000CC1U0U|5.0|I think it's phenomenal.  I hope there really will be a 4th Strokes album soon.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|What an album.It's almost flawless. I'm just going to say from the begging, Octopus's Garden is one of the most god awful songs ever. With a great intro,it's a complete let down. The lyrics are awful and so are the vocals. It really brings the album down a lot. However, the rest is amazing. It starts with a Beatle's spin on funk (Come Together). Next is George Harrison's all-time best song \\"Something\\", one of the most beautiful ballads I've ever heard. Next to \\"Everyday\\" by Buddy Holly and \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" by Eric Clapton, it's the best love song ever. \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" is demented, but catchy, and has the best rhyming Paul McCartney has ever written. \\"Oh! Darling\\" is a great rocking salute to R&B. \\"I Want You\\" is a very deep song. Many people think that it's too long, but if you stick to the end, you'll hear the best Beatle's jam and most abrupt ending.After the very heavy sound of \\"I Want You\\", there's the very optimistic, light \\"Here Comes The Sun\\". This is also amoung Harrison's best. It's very pretty and somewhat simple. \\"Because\\" has beautiful 3-way harmonies and mystical lyrics. There's no doubt that the strongest part of the album is the medley. It starts with the Apple bashing \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" which features three (maybe 4)distinct (and awesome) parts and beautiful piano. Next is Lennon's turn with the poetic \\"Sun King\\" and hilarous \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\". He gives the best part of the medley. Then there's the country-tinged \\"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window\\". Paul turns a famous Thomas Dekker song into a beautiful childhood ballad with \\"Golden Slumbers\\". \\"Carry That Weight\\" is a great anthem to the pressures of growing up, \\"The End\\" is a thrill with each guitarist taking turns with sweet solos. It also has Ringo's only drum solo ever (and it's his best moment ever). \\"Her Majesty\\" is a let down. \\"The End\\" would have been a perfect way to say goodbye, but they chose this instead. It's a nice diddy,but it's onlyPaul. They should have ended with giving each member part to shine. None the less, this is still an phenomenal album. I suggest to anyone who likes music in general. This isn't my favorite Beatles album. Just proves that everything they did was gold.
B001C46P2K|5.0|This movie was listed in my recommendations list. I hadn't heard of it before, but saw that Emily Blunt played the lead character. After reading the reviews and seeing the pictures I had to order it. I am so pleased with this movie. The characters, costumes, and settings made me feel as if I were really watching Queen Victoria in the flesh. I was just mesmerized. It was a beautiful story of determination and love. I highly recommend this movie!
0143038419|1.0|i would not recommend this book, didn't like it at all.  all my friends raved about it, but i just saw it as a bed hopping novel
B001GZ6QDS|3.0|The movie is great! but the features sucks! If you wanna buy cause of the movie go for it, but if you are a feature fun, then don't waste your $$$, we should wait till they come out with a better version and show more on how the made the movie etc.
B001MCYZJC|5.0|This album is, quite simply, one of the truly great metal albums of all time!  Thirty years later it still gives me chills.  It should not be surprising that fans of the modern genre of heavy metal (1980+) place 100 candles around this recording.  Not a dog track in the bunch.    On a recent episoded of \\"That Metal Show\\" Eddie Trunk and the gang did a two-minute throwdown comparing this album to AC/DC's classic \\"Back in Black\\".  Eddie said that as much as he admired \\"Back in Black\\", he doesn't find himself listening to it much anymore.  However he still listens the \\"Heaven and Hell\\".     I don't go more than 3 months without listening to this album, thirty years after it was recorded.  Incredible.  To me, it's the \\"Abbey Road\\" of metal.  Buy it, and buy it now!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|This is probably as amusing as the so-called summer genre of action movies can get. Don't take it serious, don't worry too much about plausibility, just go with the flow.<br />The film has two legs: crazy, stunt-driven, violent, spectacular action, and a classical spy - counter spy puzzle. Who is working for whom, who are the good guys and who the bad ones, is there a difference anyway?<br />Jolie's character (?) Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent, married to a German arachnologist in Washington. She gets exposed by a former Soviet spy master as a Soviet sleeper agent, planted in the 1980s together with dozens of others, to cause havoc in the US at a yet to be determined time. The time has come. Assassinations of the visiting Russian President and then of the American President are on the agenda. Plus a nuclear attack on some targets.<br />For most of the time we wonder if she is a Soviet spy or an American spy posing as a Soviet spy or a Soviet spy posing as an American spy posing as a Soviet spy. You know, the Escher thing.<br />A sequel is guaranteed.
B001KQKC0Q|1.0|I love the music, but don't bother downloading it here.  The best you get seems to be 256kbps.  At this bit-rate the distortion is audible even riding down the road on my motorcycle.
B003MDDGTE|4.0|Total Life Forever took me a few listens and there are some great, great tracks here (Spanish Sahara, After Glow, 2 Trees). It's definitely more mellow than Antidotes. And there aren't as many moments here that blow me away as on their prior album.<br /><br />Still, I will buy the next Foals album without question. To be clear -- this is not a misstep or a disappointment - because how could anyone better a debut as good as Antidotes?
B001AQT0RC|5.0|I have always enjoyed Contact and when I decently upgraded my DVD copy to Blu-Ray I was not disappointed.  I continue to enjoy this movie, only now in Blu-Ray.

B002ZG997M|5.0|We enjoyed this movie so much at the theater that we decided to buy the blu-ray.  We love a moral approach to life, and believe Denzel Washington was wonderful in this role......exciting, well plotted and specatacular in high definition.
B002VECMAE|5.0|Ewan McGregor revives his role as a young Obi-wan (named Bob before he took a Jedi name) who first learns about \\"the force\\" through soldiers part of an army experiment. Eventually he will train Darth Vader, the spawn of Kevin SPACEY. George Clooney, who has mastered the dark side of the force will give birth to a race of SITH. Okay, so this isn't this movie...but it could be. The movie is a satire, not just about government psych experiments, but about human belief in the supernatural. This movie is certainly not for everyone, and if you had trouble watching other Cohen films, save your time on this one. Language and very brief nudity.
B003JYOFIW|4.0|It's not Freedom of Choice or New Traditionalists (or Duty Now For The Future) -- hey! Nothing is as it once was (almost) 30 YEARS ago! -- but this a solid DEVO album.  For a mere $7.99 (for a CD? Yeah, it's 80's ALBUM pricing!), take this opportunity to revisit some dear, old(er) friends, DEVO!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I bought the first book to read while flying to Hawaii. I was hooked. I bought the second book to read on the way home. I got the third the moment it hit the book stores (hard copy only). Lisbeth Salander is my kind of girl. I just wish there were more. A true master is gone.
B002KKCWP4|5.0|April 13, 2011    I am amending my review...  It has been many months since I bought this pair of Teva sandals.  As you can read below, I love my gray pair, and actually purchased a second pair in black to alternate between the gray and black sandals.  Well, guess what, as I predicted, my dad took the gray pair of Tevas right off my feet....  He is diabetic, and the doctor told him not to wear shoes or socks (not sure why) but rather sandals...  He claims this pair is ultra comfortable - I knew he was going to take a pair off of me!  :-)  Anyway, so here I am, back at Amazon, now buying the gray pair of Tanzas again...  That makes three pairs bought thus far!  I just love these sandals - I should get some kind of a kick-back from Teva for letting everyone know I think these sandals are awesomely comfortable!!    **************************  original review **************************    This is actually my first review for a product I bought on Amazon, and I'm only doing it because I really like these Teva sandals and I figure if I'm this happy with a purchase, I should really let others know about it.  Last season I tore up my Nike sandals that I had for five years...  Ever since then I've been searching for a light-weight, comfortable, and waterproof sandal that I can wear during the Summer, and throw into the washing machine once in a while to get it really clean.      I searched everywhere - the malls, shoe stores, department stores, you name it....  I found nothing I liked.  The sandals I saw either covered up too much of the foot (dude - it's Summer, I want the foot to be UN-covered); or were too heavy; or were uncomfortable; or scratched my skin; or looked dorky; or had suede insteps (which I think would be WAY too hard to clean once you start sweating into it).      And then I said to myself, \\"check out City Sports online\\" and I came across this sandal, for $70 + shipping.  It looked just the part.  I could sweat into it, I could wash it, it looked cool, and most importantly, it looked to have straps that are padded where they touch the skin (ultra important if you want comfort).  When I looked for this pair on Amazon, I found them for much less $$ than City Sports, at $56 delivered (!) so of course I bought a pair.      Let me tell you - these sandals are everything I described and more.  I've now been wearing them almost every day for the past week and they have \\"broken in\\" and feel awesome.  The only slight downside that I experienced was the burnt rubber smell that came off the sandals when I first took them out of the box - it wasn't great.  But since the sandals were SO comfortable when I tried them on, I decided to give them a chance despite the smell, and about four or five days later, the smell evaporated into practically nothing, and I'm totally, completely pleased with the sandals.      I'm so pleased I just bought an identical second pair, in a different color, just in case my dad steals my first one (which has happened in the past).

B002ZG97RE|5.0|Interesting and I believe honest and truthful movie concerning the total sham behind the attack on Iraq.  Well documented facts revolve in this interesting and attention getting Mark Damon movie.  Damon was perfect for the part as an honest soldier with a conscience  who was amazed at all they didn't find in the search for WMD's, the political juanta prevailed. An honest soldier among the many thousands who were lied to about the ridiculous treachery of our own (then) government. Think about it.
0967175429|5.0|This book is amazing and Vianna Stibal is very talented, intelligent, and knowledgable.  You don't have to go to college to be smart and know what you are talking about.  I trust better in people who have done and practiced and learned and done hands on research rather than someone who has just been sitting in a classroom all day listening to others teach what someone else wrote in a book.  There are many people out there that have written amazing and wonderful books by doing with their own hands the things they write about and have done experiments in the field of life rather than someone telling about what someone else wrote and has no experience.  Vianna Stibal is someone with something wonderful to share with the world and she is and the results speak for themselves.  This book was written by a woman who knows what she is talking about and lives it daily.  She wants to help the world and this world needs alot of help.      Some people have put down this book and the author because Vianna does not have a college degree. Well so what?  When someone is this tuned in to such a wonderful thing and wants to share it with the world, why do we have to put them down for it??????  Read the book and find out for yourself how wonderful this book is and what a wonderful gift Vianna Stibal and this book are to the world.  Wether you learn from God, experience, others, classroom, or whatever, if you trust in it and believe it and live it and it works, then who cares where, who or when it came from?????      I know that I am going to incorporate this wonderful material and information into my Reiki sessions because I want to be the best facilitator for God's work and healings and this is definitly a wonderful and God given gift that needs to be used and shared and can help people.  I will use any methods I can to help God in His work on earth.      So read this book and think for yourself and don't let me or anyone else tell you what to read and what not to read and what to believe in and not to believe in.  I know many people who had death sentences and are still walking around the earth cured and healthy.  Doctors make mistakes all the time.  Don't let anyone tell you what to do and that you are going to die, etc.  Trust in your gut and trust in the methods and do them and learn about them.  Help yourself and know it can happen and you can heal yourself with so many wonderful methods out there and Theta Healing is among the best of them.  I will treasure it and use it till the day I leave this earth and be proud of it if only I help one person, it will have been worth it.      God Bless and keep believing and keep the faith my friends.  God does love you and so does Vianna, myself and many others.  You can heal yourself or you can go to the source and get healed there but never give up.
B000002UVX|5.0|This lp is very different from the sound of the Jimi Hendrix experience. Its a funkier, more soulful lp. Great version of Machine Gun, which Hendrix started  playing in alot of his live shows in 70. Here, with Buddy Miles on drums, give the song a heavier sound than they had with Mitch mitchell, with the  drumming sounding like an actual machine gun. Mitchell was a better overall drummer, but the fit with Miles, on this night(s) was perfect.  Who Knows and Power of Soul are also outstanding. The only drawback for me is some of Miles back up singing, which can become distracting at times. Any fan of Jimi Hendrix Experience should pick this up, give it a couple listens before judging it, as it is a differnt sound, but one thing is a constant. Jimi still jams on his guitar. That you can count on. great live album.

Using an analogy of a rider steering an elephant down a path, the Heath brothers present a collections of alternative change beliefs, many of which are just the opposite of what we have been taught in self-help books and management courses.  Full of great stories and entertaining asides, this book is a perfect way to get yourself off the dime and moving in the direction of change.
0393072231|3.0|I started this book with fairly high expectations, given that I loved Liar's Poker, and thought this is the perfect guy to help make complete sense of this whole subprime mess that completely shook the world, and permanently altered many global structures. I'm not a financial wizard, and Wall Street and high finance largely baffle me, much like they do the rest of the world, but given what a great job Lewis had done of de-mystifying it in his first book, I expected this book to finally lay bare every single thread and secret of entire collapse.    But this was not to be. Above all, I found the book to be surprisingly complex, and was forced to skim over many parts, leaving my understanding incomplete, which led to my deducting points from the book straight away. (Let me add here that while I may not be a financial genius, I'm not really a moron either, and I think I can comprehend pretty much anything if it is laid out clearly and simply.) My second complain with the book is that it seems more like the story of half-a-dozen people, and less like the story of one of the most important financial events in modern history. There's a fine line between individual stories tying into, and contributing to a greater whole, and the individual stories becoming the end in themselves - the latter is what really happens in this book. Sure, I'd like to hear about fascinating folks like Eisman and Burry, but this book was supposed to be about the subprime collapse and not about them. I think Lewis goes overboard in painting their life stories, and I suspect it's because - my third concern - he actually doesn't have enough to say about the housing collapse - at least not enough to fill an entire book. The book is short, but still feels too long.    On a positive note, Lewis's writing style is great - intelligent, reasonably simple, funny, catchy - it keeps you hooked. The writing is what finally takes this books to acceptable levels - just about. This is not recommended reading - doso only if you really have little else to read.
B001V9LRTM|3.0|I enjoyed the DVD, but this was advertised as new.  Some of the packaging was ripped and it clearly was not wrapped in original condition.  This item had been unwrapped.  Decent price and I still may have bought it, but it is nice to get things that are true to their advertisement.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Having read this book several years ago and appreciating the writing albeit the subject is sometimes dark, I was pleased to see that the movie remained true to the story line of Dennis Lehane's novel.

0393075966|4.0|We all know Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall and subsequently \\"had a great fall.\\" What we don't truly understand is:<br /><br />a. How ol' Humpty got in that precarious position in the first place (What was he thinking? What were his assumptions? Why did he go up there anyway?).<br /><br />b. Why \\"all the king's horses and all the king's men - couldn't put Humpty together again.\\"<br /><br />Columbia University's Nobel Prize winning economist, Joseph E. Stiglitz, provides the perspective that other authors who have authored volumes on the U.S. economic crisis have overlooked. It's a terribly important work that proposes explanations for the questions posed above. It's truly about 'freefall' - \\"When the world economy went into freefall in 2008, so too did our beliefs. Long-standing views about economics, about America, and about our heroes have also been in freefall.(p.xvi). Well, what might this all mean? Stiglitz is hopeful: \\"The crisis will, I hope, lead to changes in the realm of policies and in the realm of ideas.\\" (p.xiii).<br /><br />From Stiglitz' perspective, \\"This book is about a battle of ideas, about the ideas that led to the failed policies that precipitated the crisis and about the lessons that we take away from it. In time, every crisis ends. But no crisis, especially one of this severity, passes without leaving a legacy. \\"(p.xii).<br /><br />It is distinctly a crisis of our own creation, as Stiglitz says: The system that failed so miserably didn't just happen. It was created. Indeed, many worked hard-and Spent good money-to ensure that it took the shape that it did. (P. xxiv.).<br /><br />According to Stiglitz, the crisis is evidence that the marketplace of ideas failed us (particularly as this term relates to 'herd instinct'): \\"The marketplace for ideas is no more perfect than the marketplace for products, capital, and labor.

Sometimes it is hard to follow his characters because he refers to them, sometimes by their first name and sometimes by their last name and because the names are Swedish it was sometimes hard for me to follow.  And then there are a whole bunch of threads in the main story - and trying to piece that together was challenging. Actually it was all of that, that made it a great read and I loved it. As I understand it the author has died and there is a 4th book out there that is being held hostage by the authors girlfriend for money.
B003LAH7MU|1.0|I'm thinking the failure of this album to appeal to me is my fault.      I remember the excitement I felt with the Police albums and how I had to force myself to take them off my turntable or CD player (I bought both).  I remember the urgency, the raw energy, the drumming and bass propelling the songs forward, the jangley reggae influnced guitar...    Time passes and the greatest hits albums recall the age and the energy.  Time passes and the live albums lack a certain passion, but are still listenable.  Time passes and it's remixed into something for the elevator.    It's my fault.    I'm just old.      I'm waiting for senility to rob me of the memory of when listening to Police music made you want to get up and dance and bash things and dance and dance then start the album all over again.

This one centers on his early years, starting at the age of two straight on through high school hell and into college.

0307266303|5.0|My own story ties in with Author McDougall's.  So forgive my write up but this book may have been the genesis for a profound change on my part.  This book may affect you like it did myself.      I had seen extreme running for years and figured it was sort of strange obsession that modern people have.  It's like Civil War reenacting, Star Trek geeks, and people who bungie jump for a rush; people have a diversion from their weekly boring lives.  But I had heard the part about barefoot running and was intrigued, bought the book and read it.  This book may have just saved me.    The following story relates to the book.    In 2006 I had been called by the Army out of retirement to do my part to save civilization, train soldiers to fight terrorism and all that.  Then three things happened to me.  First, I was involved in a minor vehicle accident when getting training supplies that left pins in my ankle and total pain when I ran.  Second, I found out my activation did absolutely nothing to help train these soldiers.  It was pointless.  Last, I ran across an insane active duty army colonel who took it on herself with misguided zeal to have every soldier going through Ft. Sill, Oklahoma to be fitted with special shoes to prevent running injuries.    I am well over 40 and looked at this colonel the same way folks in the past had heard insane ravings from people in charge.  In your gut you know they are wrong, seriously wrong.  But you do not have the power to prevent their well intentioned bad deeds.  The weird thing, when looking back on it after reading this book, is this colonel may have injured more soldiers with bad running shoes than terrorists have done when fighting in Iraq.      In 2007 the Army sent me back to retirement.  I drounded my spirits with analogs to alcohol:  sloth and food.  While years earlier I was in fair shape.  2007 turned into later years and I got more and more out-of-shape.  I was a big and bloated normal American.      Modern doctors do not reada person a riot act as in the past.  Contrary to popular wisdom, they are far too busy for that.  They just shrug as you get more and more out of shape.  The doctor might think it's a minor bet if you will make the next annual physical.    This last June I saw this book at a library.  The story on the barefoot runner got my interest.  But this reader is a military historian and studies armies in action.    This book gave me the back ground of how the German Army beat France in 1940 and the Confederates ran rings around the Union Army in 1862 to 1863.  More on that later.    Christopher McDougall explains that we humans are born to run.  A human, with proper training, can run a marathon, lose weight, and live a very healthy lifestyle.  Indeed, I consider this book so imporatant that if every college made it required reading you would not see such heavy college students.    Honestly, I liked this book.  Christopher does two things with this book.  First, he tells us about the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico.  These people are suvivors of both the Aztec's aggression and the blood thirsty Spanish invaders of the 16th Century with their diseases that wiped out no less than 90% of the people living in the Americas [[ASIN:1400032059 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]].  The Tarahumara merely retreated to the most remote and hot part of Mexico to live their lives in peace and to be the world's last perfect runners.  The second part of this book is Christopher ties in what is wrong with our modern running.  He weaves both the Tarahumara and an introduction to running together in a seemless book that's a fun read.    Nike shoes gets a lot of the blame for the terrible running problems in America.  Why?  Nike is merely trying to sell shoes and Christopher spends chapters telling the reader about the most perfect running machine ever designed: the human foot and the human body.  Nike has done everything in their power to destroy feet in the misguided attempt of just trying to help.  Honestly, when I read that Nike knew their shoes were causing injuries when they talked to running coaches BACK IN 1988 then I was steaming and wishing some good trial lawyers were writing good notes and getting their class action suits ready.  For years this running had put up with shin splints and all sorts of other ailments.  We protect our feet too much.      Christopher takes the reader through his own reinvention as a runner.  Gone are the high-teck shoes that merely ruin a person's feet.  Christopher loses weight by adapting some of the Tarahumara's diet and just plainly not-eating-as-much.  Author McDougall sees a running specialist who shows Christopher how to properly run.  In a year he goes from barely able to run five miles to being able to run ultra marathons.    While the reader is being given stories on how Nike knows their shoes are bad, how human beings are the greatest running animals in the world they are given stories proving the fact.  A sort of humorous story is given how an in-shape college professor takes his dog out on an 85+ degree day and nearly kills the poor animal running; a properly trained runner on a hot day is dangerous to dogs.  Author McDougall writes how our lack of running is killing us and he gives us dozens of other facts about Leadville, ultra marathons, and extreme running.      I didn't quite like the stories of the Tarahumara, Leadville, \\"Barefoot Ted\\", and the other half of the book as well as learning that humans are born to run.  But the Tarahumara and \\"Barefoot Ted\\" are the reason I bought the book in the first place.  Also, some of the characters in the book are quite fun.  When a woman has Hunter S. Thompson's picture of him shooting his beloved pistol painted on her car [[ASIN:0445084316 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream]] and she is one of the top ultra-runners in the nation then a reader will think \\"the going is getting weird and these peopleare the pros\\".      So, I enjoyed reading this book.  In three months this reviewer may still be running, if the sloth demon does not get me.  But if my motivation has really returned then owe it to this book.  Hopefully in a year I'll have those fun shoes that duplicate a human's bare foot.        I highly encourage all runners and readers to buy this book.  Just the seperate advice on running, the stuff on Nike, and advice on properly training for races is worth the price.      So, I thank this book for helping to kill a sloth monster that had been around my neck for three years.  Perhaps I can run a marathon at the age over over 50.      And to people who read this book and wonder what it has to do with France of 1940 and the Confederacy of 1863 I give you these facts:  Humans are born to run.  The Confederate General \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson had such well trained soldiers that they were referred to as \\"foot cavary\\".  Marches of over 50 miles a day were nothing unusual and Stonewall soldiers often exhaused the offier's horses.  Indeed, in later years Confederate General Wheeler said during the Spanish American war \\"Union soldiers can't march worth a damn\\" when judged against the Confederate Army.  Conversely, the German Army of 1940 was able to beat the French army by running and marching nearly 40 miles a day to the sea.  The German Army merely out ran the French Army.      So, if you're a runner then this book is worth your time.  If you're an old historian who has to beat the sloth monster then this book is worth your time.    Thank you Mr. McDougall.

Other reviews had mentioned sound quality and I was almost deterred by their ratings, however I found the sound quality to be quite good for a concert.  I think they were expecting the sound quality to be that of a normal produced audio recording.  I am extremely pleased by my purchase and I'm glad to have this concert in my music library.  It makes me hope that Jamiroquai will do more live performances, and if I'm not able to attend, they will document the footage with the same clarity as this concert.  I would recommend this disc to anyone.

030745455X|2.0|Stieg Larsson's \\"Millennium Trilogy\\" has been the biggest export to come out of Sweden since IKEA. Fittingly, the trilogy's heroine, Elisabeth Salander, in this second installment makes a trip to the low-priced superstore to buy furniture for her new apartment in Stockholm, and Larsson not only informs us exactly what she buys (two sofas, five armchairs, \\"two round side-tables of clear-coloured birch,\\" a coffee table and several occasional tables), but also in which exact styles (in case you were wondering: Karlanda, Po&auml;ng, Swansbo and Lack--although, tantalizingly, we never find out about the two side-tables).<br /><br />This kind of meaningless detail is to be found throughout THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE: Larsson, who had trained and worked as a journalist for years before writing his trilogy, applied the same sort of exhaustive attention to detail to his novels, and the endless longeurs of Elisabeth's studies into higher mathematics or working to hack computer accounts seems to have found appreciative fans all over the world, mysteriously enough. This second novel in the series takes forever to get started, and spends far too much time setting up its plot before we get three murders to get things moving at quite a clip. (Perhaps aware how impatient his fans might become, the novel begins with Elisabeth foiling a husband's plan to murder his wife during a hurricane in the Caribbean that doesn't have much to do with anything later in the book.) I do have to credit Larsson with one thing, though: once his novel gets going with its murders and torture scenes and brutalizations, it just keeps going and going nonstop. This time he seems to have abandoned the P. D. James model of storytelling from the trilogy's first book (where its hero Mikael Blomqvist has to find the murderer among a family of hateful millionaires on a secluded island) for something more befitting the Jacobean stage: here we have revenge schemes and counter-revenge schemes and even at least one counter-counter-revenge scheme, with enough horrific violence to satisfy a Webster or a Tourneur.  And the villains (one of whom is deformed, the other a kind of mutant) seem to have stepped out of a James Bond tale. This thriller is nothing if not sensational; unfortunately, it's also contrived and poorly written.ounter-revenge scheme, with enough horrific violence to satisfy a Webster or a Tourneur.

B000RD0RDU|5.0|I'm using this with an Intel GMA 950 graphics chipset on an Intel Mini-ITX Atom motherboard.  First I ordered a 40x40x20 fan, but it was too big for the heat sink.  This 40x40x10 fan fit perfectly.  Other blogs recommended Scythe very highly.  I can see why.  It is very quiet, much quieter than the cheap fan that came with the motherboard.      It was hard to find a fan this size.  Most blogs have them listed under Case Fans, rather than motherboard or GPU fans.  This is a great quality quiet fan.  I had to use the 2 to 3 pin adapter that came with it.  If you aren't sure, order a fan you can uses with both 2 and 3 pin connectors.  My only complaint with this fan, is that it isn't clear with UV LED lighting.  You can't really see the fan in my computer, but that would still make it more cool and geekier.
0307454541|2.0|I respect the author's decision to draw light on cases of unreported acts of violence against women. This was one of the selling parts of this book, and that is one of the reasons I chose to read it. I question, however, how much this author actually understands women.<br /><br />As I read through the novel, there were several female characters the author spoke highly of that I simply could not relate to: Lisabeth (an anorexic who eats junkfood and is masculine in her hobbies and feminine in physique) and Erika (a lascivious woman, who is married though she is open with her husband about having a male lover). Both of these women appear to be emotionally detached (mentally handicapped?) which is far from the norm of female behavior. (They were like men with breasts!) I found them both to be extremely frustrating.<br /><br />On the other hand, there was one character I had high hopes for, but she was shot down as soon as she criticized polygamy. When Cecilia \\"gets attached\\" to Blomkvist, her moody behavior is seen as irrational and petty. Blomkvist seems to imply, \\"it's not my problem that you aren't open minded enough to have open relationships,\\" and the readers are supposed to agree with him. Cecilia was supposed to be seen as \\"old fashioned,\\" however in MY era - the era of poor early childhood education, childhood obesity, and futile economic opportunity - the notion of free love is extremely old fashioned and unrealistic (without high doses of LSD).<br /><br />Writing female characters is often problematic for male writers, just as it is often problematic for female writers to write about male characters (Twilight, to list an extreme example). The irony is that while the author is attacking crimes against women in a broader sense through his book, Larsson is simultaneously unconsciously imposing his image of the ideal woman... who just happens to lack any feminine qualities other than appearance (Thin and a picky eater OR fat and eats junk food? - CHOOSE!). Women ARE NOT like men, and feminism is not about making men out of women, but protecting equal rights under the law. (-which would include a woman's right to have free sex, as well as a man's right to wear a dress.)<br /><br />Nonetheless, I learned a lot about the author's sexual preferences reading this book, and if you are planning on seducing Larsson at any time in the future, I would definitely recommend this book.eminism is not about making men out of women, but protecting equal rights under the law.

0307266303|5.0|I am writing this review for those who may pick up the book on a whim, like I did, and come away from it completely astounded, motivated and most of all- curious. I am not a marathon runner- just an average person that tries to stay in shape with exercise here and there.    I have lived my whole life being told that my body type is not for running- that even though I have a small frame- my short and squat legs make running too damaging on my joints. And of course, when I developed a 'permanent injury' at the ripe, old age of 27, I figured they were right. But after reading McDougall's book I learned something- I routinely have purchased new and state of the art running shoes that make me feel like I can sprint into clouds- thinking this is what I have to do as my feet need all the support they can get; I pound the earth like I am wearing 50 lb weights on my ankles; and most of all, my stride is long and my back is curved. I never have known how to truly run. A few weeks ago, I went for a run using McDougall's technique and for the first time ever, I was not tired or in pain after running- and I was smiling.    McDougall is right- this is the answer to America's survival and much more- the survival of the human race. Ever since I saw Disney's Wall-E movie, I have been very disturbed by the idea that we are all on our way to \\"B&L Land\\". We, as homo sapiens, cannot deny our very nature and purpose. We were designed to move and most importantly, to run.    So, if you have not bought this book yet- run and buy it. Then, run and buy a copy for your loved ones. And most importantly- get out and move in any way you can- you will surprise yourself and realize that you are....born to run.    p.s. My only critique of the book is that I am incredibly curious about what happened to the runners after the race...what are they doing now?

I'm trying to put into words what I feel for this book and I'm coming up with nothing.  I put off another book just to read this one.  So here's what I'll say about this book.  I hope the next book is the final book and that Maggie finally gets it right.  I've never written a book so I can only throw pebbles but I want more.  Take my breath away Maggie!  I believe in you.

B002ZG980U|5.0|Those were the first words that came out of my mouth at the end of the movie- ingenius. I will be very brief.<br /><br />This is a very complex film that plays with your mind on so many levels. Nolan, has taken something very difficult and original, and open the doors for his audience to think outside of the box. Taking us on a journey, searching for the meaning or hidden meaning behind our mind. He is able to do this with such elegance, an excellent cast, superub score, beautiful & stunning filmmaking, and an awesome script.<br /><br />Many people these days need to be spoonfed every single thing they see, hear, and touch. If it is not going BANG BANG BANG or POW POW POW- then it is not something worth acknowledging or viewing. I feel sad for these individuals, because I am a critical thinker, you do not have to have a doctoral degree to enjoy Inception but you do have to think.<br /><br />For those of you who didn't get it. Or found it boring. I saw this film with my brother who is 11 years younger than me. He said it was better than Dark Knight. I said to him many people have short attention spans- and cannot deal with a movie that makes you work, challenges you to think, and makes you wait for your ending, and his answer was \\"I have an short attention span and this is the movie of all times!\\"<br /><br />So, there it is. The movie of all times. Nolan did something refreshing and new. Oh yes you get BANG and POWS, but the BANG and POW have meaning- and you have to actually take your brain off the gas and watch the movie.<br /><br />Inception is in a category all by itself.

Elements may seem like testing materials only but this book reminds readers that elements are what our tangible universe made of and ignites excitement in young children to learn more. THE book showcases each element with glorious full-page photographs with images that are familiar to us and with texts stunningly humorous, educational and entertaining. Within the two pages readers also get essential scientific data about the elements from its weight, density, radius, crystal structure to Electron Order Filling, Atomic Emission Spectrum and State Matter.<br /><br />Our 8-year old refers to it often and it will be put into good use for many years. This book is practical and serves as his own coach that takes him by hand to explore every known atom in the world.

1594488843|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book after watching Dan's TED talk.   But as some other reviewers have pointed out, he adds little substance in the book beyond that speech.    The book is layers and layers of fluff over one interesting observation about intrinsic motivation.  Dan builds this mountain of nonsense by comparing motivational strategies to computer operating systems, and labeling them 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.  I found this silly, and it also made me feel like I was reading a Fortune Magazine article from 1996, where some editor had just discovered the Internet and was in awe of the social implications.   The ideas about \\"results oriented work environments\\" and \\"20% time\\" were also well-known in the 90s, and presenting them in a 2009 book made it feel even more dated.    I was also surprised at how little data is presented in the book.  Dan references the same behavioral psych experiments over and over again.  This book was so repetitive, I was ready to throw it out the window if he said \\"carrots and sticks\\" one more time.       Somewhere around page 135, Dan must have realized that he was not fulfilling his contract to write a 200+ page book, and he starts doing quick summaries of ideas from better books, like Carol Dweck's \\"Mindset\\", Mikhaly's \\"Flow\\", and Colvin's \\"Talent is Overrated\\".   He then ends the book with a 65 page \\"toolkit\\" that summarizes the work of many other books, and takes the most obvious, trite recommendations out of those books.    I've read a lot of books on motivation and business, but have never seen an author try to stretch out a topic like this.   If you're interested in intrinsic motivation, read \\"Flow\\" or \\"Mindset\\", or watch Dan's speech at blog.ted.com.   I also think the bigger lesson from this book isn't about intrinsic motivation, but that in an age where there's free content all over the web, non-fiction authors should really give their readers something in the book they can't get on the web.   Malcolm Gladwell and the Freakonomics guys do a pretty good job of this.   Dan doesn't.
0307463745|1.0|The F bomb? Yes, on page 235 it says \\"Give me a f...ing break\\". When you are used to reading books on business by Ziglar, Rohn, Maxwell, Widener, Jolley,  Hardy, Waitley, or Tracy you get spoiled on mature, professional writing that you wouldn't mind your teenagers reading.  I probably read 25-30 books a year and can't recall this in a business book.  I can't believe Crown Publishing let this get by. It would've had the same effect to say \\"Give me a break\\". Maybe there were others that read this and said yeeeessss!! My regret is that this was not on page 20 or earlier. Could have saved some time.  Maybe this is what I get for not reading their blog. Maybe I would've known what to expect.<br /><br />What is funny is that I was looking on-line at the products of 37signals until I got to page 235 even though the book was not informative. The looking stopped there but according to the book, they don't care. No planning, don't listen to the customer?<br /><br />Here is how I felt after 232.2 pages. You've had nothing to eat all day.

Panem is so corrupt that every year, in order to keep its populace amused and distracted, it holds what it calls the Hunger Games, where two contestants from each district (there are twelve in all) compete to win what's more or less a reality TV show, except _this_ particular reality TV show is to the death and there can be only one winner.  The heroine of \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a teenage girl, Katniss; she's tough, strong, competent, but not always likable, and because she hunts and traps for survival, is at a major advantage in this game.  Her love interest is a guy named Peeta, a friend of hers from District 12 (where they're from, the most impoverished district of the lot) -- he's a smart, competent teenager who's drawn to Katniss despite her flaws (or perhaps even because of them).  And because he'd known her forever, knows the good in her, that helped balance out Katniss's cold, manipulative nature, and allowed the reader to root for Katniss and Peeta.  This way, the reader could enjoy the \\"against the odds\\" ending where the two of them won the Hunger Games before going home to their impoverished district, which satisfactorily ended \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" opens just after the previous novel, \\"The Hunger Games,\\" and probably won't be understood without it.  But if you've read thus far, you know Katniss and Peeta need to do a \\"victory parade\\" through the twelve districts, and the assumption from the first is that they will be safe for the rest of their lives.  But we know that can't be right -- the rulers of Panem are vindictive and cruel, and they don't particularly like it that they were manipulated by Katniss into declaring both she and Peeta (an acknowledged love match) as the co-winners of the past Hunger Games.  Which is why when a \\"new\\" version of the Hunger Games occurs -- one that \\"reaps\\" people from the past winners, and takes two from each district, we know both Katniss and Peeta are going back into the arena.<br /><br />All the action, once we get to it -- about halfway to two thirds of the way in, I'd estimate -- is fine, and Collins has the characterization of Peeta and Katniss spot-on.<br /><br />Other pluses?  Well, I felt sorry for the downtrodden servants called \\"Avox\\" -- they've had their vocal cords ripped away by the brutal rulers of Panem because they were compassionate and spoke up.  (We know this because at least one of them is a former peace officer Katniss knew while growing up, a particularly kind and thoughtful man.)  I still believed in the halting romance between Katniss and Peeta, and I wasn't scandalized by the brutality of the arena as it makes sense in this type of dystopic milieu.<br /><br />Yet something was missing from this book, something evanescent yet powerful, something so elusive it is nearly impossible to name.  I can't say that hope is lost -- hope seems closer than ever despite the brutality of the rulers of Panem at the end of \\"Catching Fire\\" (which I refuse to spoil).  I can't say that I don't care about what happens to Katniss, Peeta and the rest -- because I still do care, and want to read the third book, \\"Mockingjay,\\" which will be out in another month as I write this.<br /><br />But something isn't here that was present in spades in \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  I can't believe it's just that the novelty has worn off, and I don't believe it's that this book went further in-depth regarding the politics of Panem, nor that the book is slower to get ramped up than the previous (I can handle all of that).<br /><br />My best guess at what's missing is the lack of perspective -- the ending is a major shock to Katniss's system, and because I can't really discuss that, I can't explain why I feel the ending seems rushed and unbelievable.  Further, I don't know how Katniss could stay sane after the events of both the previous novel and \\"Catching Fire,\\" nor do I understand a culture that televises something so brutal and heart-wrenching not being willing to discuss any other country besides itself.  (This is the same criticism I had of the previous book, mind, but it comes into starker relief and is a bigger problem due to the ending of _this_ book.)<br /><br />Because I find the ending unbelievable, and because I do not like the lack of perspective, I can give this novel only 3.5 stars -- and at that, I'm rounding _down_ rather than up for Amazon.com's purposes (something I usually don't do) because this book is closer to \\"it's OK, but I'll never read it again\\" than \\"a good novel, something I will re-read in the future\\" like I ranked \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />In short, I like Suzanne Collins' writing.  I like it a lot.  But I don't think this story ended in the right place, and it makes me less likely to immediately seek out \\"Mockingjay\\" (though I do have plans to eventually seek it out due to the strength of the first book).<br /><br />3.5 stars, rounded _down_ to three stars, with no recommendation either way.<br /><br />Barb Caffreyay sane after the events of both the previous novel and \\"Catching Fire,\\" nor do I understand a culture that televises something so brutal and heart-wrenching not being willing to discuss any other country besides itself.

B000094HLA|5.0|Andr&aacute;s Schiff is able to make even those who have Bach's glorious GOLDBERG VARIATIONS memorized from numerous other recordings  (or having been able to play these extraordinary variations on their own) hear them afresh.  Schiff's approach is so intimate, beginning with the statement of the original aria through all the variations until the aria is once again allowed to sing alone, that he makes us feel as though he were sitting at the keyboard in a room occupied only by the artist with us as the only guest.  This is transparent Bach, every phrase and variation stated with such clarity and beauty that the fact that these variations are technically difficult is simply submerged in the quality of music that flows from Schiff's hands and heart.<br /><br />Works as important in music history and in the hallowed place in the heart of millions in the centuries since it was composed are bound to have strong opinions about performance - whether the work should even be played on the piano as opposed to the harpsichord, whether what Glenn Gould attached to these variations are valid or no, etc - and that is unavoidable.  What  Andr&aacute;s Schiff accomplishes in this recording is that touch with transcendence that makes all other arguments fade. Yes, there are many superb performances of this work and a legion of recordings that are exceptional, but returning to the very origin - the aria on which the work is based - played in the way Schiff caresses it without smothering it in either sentiment or academia, gives ample proof that the following variations of that little miracle aria will satisfy the way Bach wished them to satisfy.  No matter how many recordings you may have of this work, expand your appreciation of it with Andr&aacute;s Schiff. Grady Harp, July 10

B002ZG97RE|4.0|I'm glad I finished the movie and made it past the opening jittery hand held camera action scene.  Matt Damon is an amazing actor and despite his good looks is believable as \\"Chief\\".  Chief is a warrant officer on the hunt for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  Chief gets caught in a situation of having to decide to just do his job or do what is right. If you can put aside the politics and view this film not as a message film, but entertaining and thought provoking, it's great!  A fast paced action film that entertains and highlights underlying ethical issues.  It shows enough of the human side of various characters and their sides to allow you to empathize with all the positions.  The film does an excellent job of slowly unveiling the complexity of the issues.  It makes it clear there are no easy answer.  Yet the film ends with a simple conclusion for Chief's part of the story and lets hang the complexity and chaos of the larger problems.
0061148512|4.0|\\"The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence.\\"            So, I missed the boat on this one, back in high school when every literate fifteen year old girl was reading it.  I'm glad I waited out.  I think I would have liked it, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.    Ok. The book morbidly fascinates me--a thinly veiled autobiograhical novel of a poet's descent into madness written by a woman who later stuck her head in an oven and committed suicide.  Just from this knowledge, the book becomes immediately haunting. But it's not just this black curiosity that made this an engaging read.  I love how absolutely honest it is.  Unlike other books I have read in which the protagonist goes \\"crazy,\\" Esther Greenwood's insanity is subtle and far more realistic.  At the beginning of the book, Esther seems relatively put together, but she slowly unravels so fluidly that I surprised myself when I realized, \\"Wow.  This girl is really crazy.\\"  Perhaps because it is based on personal experience, I think that Plath's depiction of depression is so well-done.  She shows that it is not a raging force, but rather a paralysis, a lack of emotion--and all through beautiful and intense language.    This book is a good read, but it will depress you.  That being said, I would recommend it, especially to girls in college who feel like they can relate to Plath's story.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Avatar is little more than a propaganda film to make Americans look bad.    Why some Yanks spend money on this is beyond me.    Avatar begins with the now VERY familiar premise that humanity has used all its natural resources and now must look elsewhere for its necessities.    The 'futuristic' (Set in the year 2154) dialogue even contains the phrases \\"shock and awe\\" and \\"daisy cutter\\".  While \\"American\\" is never uttered, every word spoken by an evil \\"human\\" was in an \\"American\\" accent.    The Blue People were so preposterously pure and the (American accent) earthlings so preposterously wicked. The whole tale was so simplistic, as events in history never are.     It's essentially a remake of \\"Dances With Wolves\\" and every other movie where the evil Americans terrorize the indigenous natives, kill them, take their land, and are just all around imperialistically wicked and inhumane.  Oh, and we're destroying the environment, clearing precious giant trees and natural landscapes and killing rare animals and their habitats, in order to invade and harvest valuable substances under the ground.  Sound familiar?    A left-leaning Hollywood movie: no surprise there. So Third Worlders will eat it up. The Iranians, for example, should love \\"Avatar\\" if, of course, their government would let them see it, which surely won't happen.    Hopefully in the up comming movie, 'Man Conquers Space' the politics will be more subdued.    Please hurry with Star Trek XII.
B003NFM3JU|1.0|I think it is a crime to offer this BluRay disk only in the Theater version 3D.  I realize the regular BluRay 3D like that used in Polar Express is kind of crummy, at least we are able to watch it in 3D.  To watch \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in 3D you have to buy a new 3D BluRay machine plus a new screen.  That is unbelievable in these hard economic times to expect people to go out and buy new expensive hardware for the few movies that will be available in the theater version 3D.  Then I don't like the fact the shuttered 3D glasses have to be hooked up by wires to the 3D player.  If the also offered a regular 3D version in the set then I would go a head and buy it hoping that in the future I might come into some money to watch the theater version 3D.  However, that will never happen.  I am stuck with my current equipment until they die or I die which ever comes first.  I am very upset with the producers of this set!

0375704027|4.0|I've decided to take on some of Murakami's works. I'm really interested in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, but it's just too damn long. I was afraid of such an undertaking considering I've never read this author before, so I decided to test the waters with Norwegian Wood, which is far shorter.    The book takes place in Japan during the 1960's. Toru is a college student who is romantically involved with two very different girls, Midori and Naoko. He has a strange history with Naoko--she dated Toru's best friend since childhood, but then he commits suicide. Naoko is a character who is \\"beautifully broken\\"--mentally fragile, the kind of girl you just want to hold. She is unable to deal with her pain and begins to live in a colony where people try to heal themselves through farmwork, simple routine, and exercise. The patients and doctors are almost indistinguishable from each other. The place sounds like a kind of awesome Utopia. Scenes between this colony and \\"the real world\\" with Midori are very unsettling. Murakami plays with the reader's sense of reality, and at times it is difficult whether things are happening only in Toru's mind or in actuality.    I particularly liked the book's characters, especially Midori. She's an absolute gem. I don't remember the last time I've liked a character so much. Perhaps it was because I loved Midori so intensely, but Toru came off as a bit of an ass sometimes.    I think I will definitely read some more Murakami. I'm always hesitant about reading translations...I know that it's irrational, that translations are usually good, but there's always a part of me that's thinking, \\"but that's not the EXACT word the author wanted to use!\\" However, I have heard that Murakami's English translations are fantastic, and after reading Norwegian Wood I would have to agree.
0767903862|5.0|Outstanding read!  Travels in Australia, urban, rural & outback.  One theme throughout is how there is much to know about, and much happens, Down Under, yet the rest of the world never finds out.  Not to mention the length of flight to get there!  Yet the cities are clean and inviting while the people are friendly, the distances to travel are great, the skies radiant, the weather mostly warm to very hot.

B00006CXSS|2.0|This was very watchable at the time I went through it, but it fails a critical test:  I wouldn't watch it again.<br /><br />I think the core problem is that it's not about anything.  Unlike other war novels I'm aware of (Naked and the Dead, All Quiet on the Western Front, Catch-22), this novel has no central theme, no central concern, no \\"message\\" -- if you will.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'm articulating myself well, so here's what I mean:  do you notice that EVERYTHING happens in this series?  Yeah, everything happens to everybody, so you are free to conclude whatever you want from its contents.  There's a guy who loses his courage.  There's a guy who gets his courage.  There's a guy who sees the brutality of war.  There's a guy who doesn't.  There's a guy whose life is ruined by the war.  There's a guy whose life is vastly improved.  There's a guy who's promoted.  There's a guy who's not.  There's a guy who is made wise by battle.  There's a guy who learns nothing.  Whatever you'd like to see in war, whatever you'd like to take from it, there's a guy in this series who pretty much does that for you.<br /><br />A failure on the writer's part!  Art should hone life, bring it into focus, distill it.  Not present it in toto.  If that's all you're doing, what do we need you for?  Just make a documentary and we'll draw our own conclusions.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|As we all know this is a remake of the original film of the same name. When that's the case, comparisons are always made. So first and foremost the question that comes to mind is does this film hold a candle to the original, was it done well enough that it's existence is warranted? The answer? Sorry, I don't have one just yet. We'll have to figure this out together. What I do know, is that there's something wrong with this film that's preventing it from being what it could be.    Despite the rumblings of negative initial reviews, I went into this one wanting all the original had to offer, (because really, if you watch the original with a critic's eye, it's got a lot of it's own flaws and plot holes) an enjoyable time. The problem here is that even though I went into it without the negative baggage, I still went into it biased. I wanted to like this movie. But the difference here is the original piece has a few qualities the modern one does not: a sense of mysticism, charm, an epic other timely feel, and people who stand by what they believe. Without these pieces of the puzzle this film feel soulless, and in the end we don't care about what's happening because we don't care about the people.    Several points of confusion: What do the gods want? What do the people want? I know the gods need the prayers of the people to remain powerful, and I know the people want to either a) survive or b) be god-free. The problem is, the writer spends the entire time telling this to us, by repeated bashing us over the head with myriad exposure to the phrase \\"I do this as a man\\" from Perseus, or Zeus or Hades uttering they need the prayers to remain strong. What the writer and the actors don't do is reveal to us through their actions this is what they feel, or explore variety using other dialogue the conflicts within the characters themselves. In fact they all come across as so wishy-washy that there are several points of self-contradictoring actions. Why do the gods help Perseus defythem? Why is Perseus told to accept the gifts from the gods when they are on a mission to defy the gods? And why are the other men in such disbelief when Perseus does not want to use these items for that reason? I never really got a sense for why any of these things were the way the were. There's no cohesiveness at all to the characters or the plot, and due to poor writing you either don't know why they do what they do (there aren't any motives revealed) or you are only TOLD a very basic why they're doing what they're doing. There's no depth. In this film, and I know in old mythology it usually is the case, but this makes him uninteresting, Zeus is a dick and shows no real care for the humans what so ever, even though he's been stated as having loved man too much, but for some reason he cares about Perseus, his son. I understand this should be a simple fill in the blank conjecture: he's his son, that's why he cares. But none of his other actions within the film show that this is a possibility, that he can care for anyone other than himself. He's just an outright dick. There's an instance in the film during the exploration of the Calibos origin, where Zeus goes to Earth and sleeps with Calibos' wife, impregnating her because Calibos waged a war against the gods. ... Seriously, you are a god who wields lightning like a javelin and the best you can come up with for revenge is something petty like knocking up his wife? So not only is he a dick, but he's petty too. Where as in the original, he is hesitant about his decisions to attack humans and it is only because of the politics of 'the gods' that he ultimately decides to do what he does, and he is shown, in the original, genuinely concerned for Perseus numerous times, asking the aid of other gods in private for tools they can give Perseus to succeed.    Also, there's no sense of urgency in between the action scenes. It really feels like they're just clipping along, hitting all their spots and that's that. Not once doI feel like the characters feel there's any importance to what their doing. Perseus, not once does anything for anybody other than himself. He's not on this mission for the one he loves, like in the original, but for revenge. And I know there are great films built around revenge like \\"Oldboy\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\" but in those films the characters are passionately seeking revenge, in this one Perseus just gets upset about Hades killing his parents and then says he's not a demi-god, then says \\"If I do this, I do it as a man.\\" Seriously, this seems to happen in between every fight seen. And here in I think I discovered a cause for disconnect: Sam Worthington. I hear he's a nice guy, but honestly he's truly a case of 'the right look, but just not right for the role.' I want to like him, and he looks the part, but he just never really has me believing anything he does. He really really mugs his emotions. I know there's the whole argument that if you simply look a certain feeling on camera the audience will project whatever they think you're feeling onto you. That might be true but it can't feel forced or needs to feel natural, and there needs to be variety to help create a sense of depth. Just because we believe the first reaction doesn't mean we'll believe that same reaction every time. Mr. Worthington just hasn't shown me he has variety or depth yet.    Another problem the film has is that thematically, it's a mess. What do you take away from this film? Fate is not certain? Humans create their own fate? Humans don't need the gods? None of the above holds true do to the actions of the characters and the story. Fate is not certain: but Perseus is told he was born to do a certain thing in the film. And he does just that. Scratch that one. Humans create their own fate: Okay, so he's told he dies but doesn't. Okay, but then he still does what he's fated to do. So that one is half wrong half right, meaning it's pointless. Humans don't need gods: But he needs the gifts of thegods to succeed. So that one's gone too. Essentially you walk away with no morale or theme, no message, everything you watched was unimportant. I know there are movies that people enjoy with no theme or morale compass to learn of, but none of those movies literally present a morale in the film and then contradicts it, or they're so bad they're funny. This one is not the later.    The ultimate problem is that this movie relies heavily on audiences having seen the original and simply hitting all the marks of the original, essentially going \\"See, look at all the things that look better now that we've got this technology.\\" And it really does this without making the film anything special that stands out from the original, other than the special effects. When that's the case, it may have well not been made at all. Look at the first Star Wars re-release with added footage. One phrase: CGI Jabba.    Some minor things, Why did the creative team feel the need to add the Jin? I don't remember those being in the original. It adds nothing to the movie other than being a cheap quick get-out-of-jail- free card for our hero, immediately eliminating any tension possible when there's a danger to him like when they are faced with the giant scorpions, when our hero is poisoned, and when they need transportation. All those problems are solved by this character. When you add something to a film that really doesn't add anything to the story or character depth, there's no point in having it in the first place.    I heard a lot of the problems people had with the film is the decision to show it mostly in 3-D, and while I do have a problem with that aspect of the film, I more-so simply have a problem with 3-D in general. But that's a different discussion.    There are things I did like. Gemma Arterton for one, not really for her portrayal of Io, a fellow demi-god who never appears in the original story, I've just got a crush on her. You can see her again in a similar role, in a movie similarin style, in 'Prince of Persia: Sands of Time.' The design of the world and creatures are nice. But two things I think they should've done: Not shown the Kraken in the trailers. Everyone who's seen the original would've flocked to see this movie for a chance to see what it looked like. I know for marketing reasons they probably wanted to entice newcomers which may have also had an adverse effect since it's only in the movie for like 5 minutes. Probably getting a \\"that's it\\" response from the newbs. It would've gotten buzz simply from word of mouth from the people who have seen it. They also should've have shown the entire upper body of the Kraken in one shot, not just sections. I mean what we saw was an awesome design, and it's not a case of hiding it to enhance the atmosphere of the situation. In this case showing the awesome entirety of the creature would've been more effective, and would not have taken away from the colossalness of the creature. If anything seeing it's full stature vs the city would've improved that feeling of 'holy crap!'    Going into this film there was a hope of seeing a great action movie with awesome fantasy aspects and larger than life epic characters. What is shown is a by the marks re-hash of the original with a few added elements, very few of which add anything that defines this film and makes it stand on it's own two feet. In the end it's nothing more than a Clash of the Titans re-release with added CGI bonuses, making it's creation wholly unneeded, and in this case, unwanted.

It's such a strange thing, the build of the film. At the beginning it very gently hints at humor, kind of sweetly lulls you into feeling like it's a quaint 'slice of life' piece then slowly, not methodically, but very ... musically layers the pieces together to one giant emotionally climactic scene. I mean, this thing hit me like a brick, I can't remember the last time I cried during a film. Just... wow.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|No one could dispute that this CD contains some of the most wonderful pop music ever recorded.  My only reservation is that the chronological progression, however valuable as document, does not present some of these songs that well.  Because \\"Love Me, Do\\" was their weakest song (I am certainly glad they recorded it---it put them on the map), this CD has a weak opening.  \\"From Me To You\\" is not all that good, either, compared with other songs they did at the time.  And \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", with the dread Phil Spector overdubs, sounds so little like the Beatles.  So this CD  both opens and ends weakly.  And where is \\"Please Please Me\\", not only a wonderful song, but their first number one?    I guess it could been regarded as a musical trajectory---the artistic rise and fall of the Beatles.  But it's a good CD to play on shuffle.    Think of how strongly \\"Pepper\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" both begin and end.  The Beatles 1 does not have this quality.  But do not misunderstand, it is essential anyway.
B000005RFQ|5.0|I vividly remember when this album was released in 1983, I was in the 8th grade and the album probably contributed to my future juvenille deliquency and distrust of the church!<br /><br />Satan must've possessed Ian during the recording of this album, as Ian recalls having a hard time remembering the lyrics live, and belts out lines unlike anything he did for the most part in Deep Purple.  Gutteral howls, laughing and shrieks abound, backed-up with a heavy distorted synth sound from Iommi and Geezer that is unique, setting it apart, appropriately, from everything else in the Sabbath catalogue.<br /><br />The album manages to be frightening, both in its audacity (for the time) and darkness, filled with religious symbolism and of course lyrics about Satan!  I consider it more of a side project where the singer of Deep Purple joined Sabbath for an album, and it's so bizarre and demented, teeming with style and rebellious themes, as well as good riffs and memorable songs, that it certainly affects people who like it.<br /><br />I am not sure why Sabbath fans would dislike this album, there was nothing like it when it came out, much like the original Sabbath back in '69 and '70.<br /><br />The album cover is just awesome, something to frighten the parents with.  And when they hear songs such as \\"Disturbing The Priest,\\" \\"The Dark,\\" or \\"Trashed,\\" they'll send you to a reformatory.<br /><br />I just wanted to pay some homage to a classic heavy metal album, that doesn't get a ton of attention or respect.  It's definitely \\"out there,\\" albeit with a lot of good Iommi riffs and song-writing, but that is what makes it great.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|Absolutely magnificent.  He stays true to his original style without remaining stagnant as an artist.  It's fun and flirty, while sultry and soulful at the same time.  All of the tracks fit beautifully together, and it has a natural progression about it beginning with the single, \\"You and Your Heart\\" crescendoing in style...then decrescendoing and ending with more serious and touching songs, which seem to make poignant remarks on his own life experiences like \\"Anything But the Truth\\"<br /><br />If you liked his previous material, you'll adore this.  If you're looking to branch out genre-wise, give this a try...any music lover will be pleasantly surprised.
0143038419|5.0|I don't normally write reviews about anything, but I feel like this book is worth reviewing. I also don't believe in spoilers, so you won't find any in my review either. After taking a month break from reading, I re-emerged with this book as my starting point. I read it within two days- getting up before work and rushing home after work to continue reading. Elizabeth writes poetically, but at the same time down to earth. I felt like I could identify with her even though I haven't gone through everything she has. Throughout the entire book, I didn't feel like she was narcissistic like some other reviewers have said, rather I thought she was doing what we all need to do as human beings- and that is find ourselves so we can live with others in harmony.   I have given this book to everyone I know- I pity those who haven't had the chance to read it. If you are able to buy it today, you should- it will change your life.

0545123283|3.0|In Linger, (the sequel to Shiver) the story picks up as life resumes for Grace and her love Sam who appears to have been cured of the werewolf curse. Having made it through the last days of winter and now entering spring, Sam and Grace are on the watch for early shifters especially those newly created like Cole St. Clair.<br /><br />Cole is restless, dark, damaged. He chose this life; wanted the escape. So why was he in human form and why couldn't he shift back into the wolf? Unfathomable to Sam, who risked death to become perpetually human, Cole tries everything he can think of to make his shift into wolf form permanent. The last thing Sam needs to be worrying about is a loose canon like Cole when his entire life is on the precipice of unthinkable change.<br /><br />Something is wrong with Grace. A strange illness awakens within her, depleting her body and leaving her weakened and afraid. As she slowly deteriorates, Sam who's been ordered to stay away from her after being discovered in her room one night, fears he's about to lose the only girl he has ever loved.<br /><br />Not quite as riveting as the first novel, Linger has some seeming errors in logic (see spoiler alert below) that I found rather distracting. Those detractors aside, Stiefvater delivers a compelling and sometimes poignant continuation of the storyline and I look forward to the next sequel in the series.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: The following paragraph contains information that may giveaway certain details of the stories mystery or suspense...<br /><br />A few problems: In Shiver Grace is 17 and in chapter 3 reflects on her wolf attack experience 6 years ago, which would have made her 11 at the time of the attack. In Linger, Grace is still 17 but she is supposed to have been originally bitten over a decade ago. Another blaring problem is that in chapter 37 of Shiver, Grace is attacked by the wolf Shelby in her kitchen and bitten on the arm. In Linger Cole hypothesizes that Grace needs to be re-infected with the wolf poison essentially resetting Grace's shifting. However, that would have already occurred with the wolf bite from Shelby if that were true. I'm hopeful that these issues will be \\"cleaned up\\" in the next sequel.y resetting Grace's shifting.

B003405MF6|3.0|I always loved Jeff Beck work, this record is interesting mostly about the blend beetwen his guitar and the orchestra (mostly strings).His playing on this record will perhaps disappoint some fans as he plays less notes with less effects than usual; I like it as he shows here an extreme sensivity (we are used to this with him but here it's even more).What I don't like are songs like \\"I put a spell on you\\" and others as the singers are not so good to me; I would have prefered an all instrumental record.  But the real thing that bother me (that's why 3 stars only) is the  overly compressed sound , sometime distorded or very close to, so that it destroy dynamics like on rap records.....the volume war again that I didn't expect from such a great and sensitive artist.......

0061876747|1.0|I learned of this book via the net on what I think was titled \\"Stephen King's 10 Best Summer Reads\\". I figured that if it was recommended by THE MASTER it had to be OK.  Wrong!  Save your money!!  SPOILER ALERT STARTING NOW...  In a nutshell:  the main character is a whimp who makes a series of mind-numbing, unbelievable, and poor decisions, e.g.  not reporting a murder he practically witnesses, disposing of a friends body in broad daylight inside a refrigerator case, taking up residence in the slum complex of his chief enemies....  Other characters are right out of Hollywood B movies:  the hooker with a heart of gold; the cruel and sadistic for hire x-army killer;  the female cop who just can't seem to find the right man; the young boy who needs a father figure; the weak corporate CEO, etc.  Another big problem for American readers (at least for me) is the British slang used throughout the book, examples:  \\"clever-clogs\\", bloke\\", wanker\\", \\"poncy\\", on and on. And by the way, the plot has nothing to do with weather or storms!   -30-
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is a fabulous Movie, and it is certain to change your life. This documentary explains some of the reasons not previously disclosed for our national problems with weight gain. This shows how apparently up to 90% of our soybeans are controlled by a chemical company, and are apparently sprayed with roundup as they grow. We need to understand what is happening with the food supply, and how it affects us as well as the animals and crops. Excellent. The realistic parts are tough showing actual animals but those parts are short. See the entire film and you will make changes in your life for the better.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|[[VIDEOID:5d7fcb31610584584424828156863758]] UPDATE AS OF June 2015:<br />Nearly FIVE YEARS later, I am glad to report that this bag has held up tremendously over the years. Besides a few rips and tears in the fabric (due to rough handling on vacations and excursions), the bag is still protecting my gear! I've since traded out some of my equipment and adopted new camera lenses. This bag still handles anything thrown at it. Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite Amazon purchases to date. I hope everyone continues to find my review helpful (man this was shot when I was still in high school!).<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE AS OF 1/9/11:<br />This bag is still doing wonderful, but I thought I should update you guys on the gear it is holding. Currently, it is holding my Canon Rebel XTi (w/ battery grip), Canon EF 70-300mm USM, Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS, Canon EF 50mm f/1.8, Canon EF 28-80mm, and Canon EF-S 18-55mm. As well, it is holding my Canon ZR930 MiniDV camcorder, Canon Rebel 2000 film SLR, filters, pouch of accesories such as chargers, memory card reader, etc, and a few little items. This bag seems to hold whatever you throw at it! Still a 5 star bag!<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I added a video to this review to show the amounts of gear able to be stored in this bag.<br /><br />I have been looking to purchase a camera backpack for my SLRs, lenses, and other accessories, and I had narrowed it down to the Canon 200EG backpack. I loved the compact size to the bag, but the large area inside for about two bodies (a must) as well as excess room for lenses. I tried the bag out at Best Buy, and I was about ready to purchase it on Amazon, until this bag came up as a recommended choice. It looks identical to the Canon, but without the giant 'steal me' Canon logo. Reviews for this bag backed up my choice, so I figured I would try this baby out, and if I din't like it, just return it for the Canon.<br /><br />Little did I know, this bag exceeded my expectations with features much better than the 200EG. For one, the extra padding on the shoulder straps. You also get a belt strap to support your back with heavy gear. I'm about 5'3\\" and the bag fits snug and comfortably.<br /><br />The exterior is made of a durable material, which should hold up against rain. The interior is padded very nicely to secure your gear in the bumpiest of my bike rides, which is nice. The zippers are sturdy, although I wish they were easier to put a lock onto. Lets talk about what this bad boy can hold. I am able to fit my DSLR Canon Rebel XTi (w/ battery grip) in the main slot, my film Rebel 2000 infront of the XTi, my PowerShot P&S, my MiniDV camcorder, 75-300mm telephoto lens, 28-80mm walk-around lens, and 18-55mm kit lens, with room to spare! In the meantime, I keep my chargers, minidv tapes, and remotes in the open spot. That is until I invest in a flash unit. If you pack everything right, you can easily pack three SLR bodies, three lenses, a P&S, and other gear in the bag. The top mounted pockets is home to my filters, memory cards, cables, and cloths. The side of the bag can hold a tripod safe and securely. You can also find spots for a phone, or even fit a small notebook pc (more likely a netbook) in the main pocket. Which is nice considering there is no laptop slot.<br /><br />All in all, this bag is highly recommended in my opinion. Keep it in mind in your searches, and don't click away because it is Amazon branded. It's higher quality than my old Lowepro!ntil this bag came up as a recommended choice.

193413712X|5.0|I loved this sweetly inspired book, and found it very moving, fully deserving of its prizes and praise. The intergenerational story of a humble New England family revolves around a father and a son who have an affinity for nature and for one another, and share many of the same characteristics. We meet the son in old age, as he lays dying, in a disordered but poignant delirium. His family is gathered in a vigil around his bed. He alternately dives and resurfaces through the dim and chaotic memories of the loss of his father, searching back. In a parallel narrative, the reader also is introduced to the close, inner workings of the father, who was a traveling tinker in the early 1900s in Maine. Unfortunately he had a unpredictable seizure disorder.The confusion that accompanied the prodrome and the sequelae of his \\"fits\\" was misinterpreted as a kind of madness by his wife, which rings true of the public's attitude toward epilepsy at the time. The clarity with which Harding cements them to one another as a father and son, but also as interesting and flawed men, is astonishing. As one man lives his life backwards, the other advances forward, until the reader comes to understand them. The writing is poetic, and to an untuned ear sometimes challenging, as good reading should be.     And such sharply drawn portraits of his mother, and sister! Not a word is wasted, and his use of metaphor too, is used sparingly, but to great effect.    Paul Harding has made a strong debut and I would happily follow him and this family anywhere.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is totally engrossing i enjoyed it so much i could not put it down.The story to me was full of  excitment adventure and romance. It is a good book for all ages i am only 11 ad i have heard of middle aged adults that like it it is defenitly one of my favorite books ever. My best friend read it too and she was the one who recomneded it to me and now i am so glad she did.
B002OMZTSU|4.0|As a fan of his show it gave me a new appreciation of him as a person.
006088732X|5.0|I wasn't quite sure how many stars to give this book. It certainly isn't a great piece of literature so I didn't want to give it 5 stars. Then again, I'm sure most people didn't expect the book to be considered as such. Being a teenager, I'm always interested in quick reads and \\"trashy\\" teen series. I certainly don't limit myself to these types of books, but, honestly, YA is probably my favourite genre. I've read everything from Gossip Girl to Twilight. Series books are either hit or miss with me. I don't want to waste my time or money on a series that isn't going to keep my attention throughout all the books. Having a series made into a TV show is usually a turn-off for me. I stopped reading the Gossip Girl series a little bit after the show aired. It just lost some of its appeal.<br /><br />That being said, I completely love this book. The TV series has been one of my summer must-see shows and I can't wait a new episode each week. Once after an episode aired, I couldn't wait another week to find out what happens. I went out a bought the first three books. I couldn't put down Pretty Little Liars once I started reading. The characters differ enough to where almost anyone can relate to one of them. It's like Desperate Housewives for teens. The fact that the group of girls are connected by someone who didn't have their best interest at heart is what really interested me. It certainly is a series that will keep your attention past the first couple books.

B002WTC8RA|4.0|As you might guess just from its whimsical title, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a charming and entertaining read about an episode in history that wasn't at all charming or entertaining:  the German occupation of the island of Guernsey during WWII.  The book is in epistolary format:  a series of letters between the various characters, which makes the tone chatty and the reading fast.<br /><br />The book takes place from January to September of 1946 and centers on Juliet Ashton:  a young writer who has just published her best-selling debut book, and who is now searching for a topic for another book.  At the same time she is adjusting to life in post-war London, which is, in some ways, more difficult than life was during the war.  She suddenly receives a letter from a stranger on the island of Guernsey, and from this simple beginning sprouts a stream of correspondence between Juliet and various islanders, and her introduction to their Literary Society.  Eventually Juliet realizes she has stumbled upon the topic for her next book and she makes a trip to Guernsey to meet the friends she has been corresponding with.  She will discover that she has stumbled on much more than just a topic for her next book.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully entertaining book, and the only reason I am giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is because of a few episodes towards the end.  These involved Billie Bee Jones, Gilly Gilbert, the Benoit sisters and Isola Pribby trying to play Miss Marple.  Although as stated before, this is a lighthearted book, and although it is obvious what the authors were trying to accomplish, these scenes were just silly.  Although all of the Guernsey islanders were somewhat quirky, these particular scenes made them seem cartoonish. It would have been better if the authors would have used some other plot devices to accomplish their purpose.<br /><br />If you're looking for a serious, thoughtful, even somewhat weighty book on WWII then keep looking because this is not it.  Even the serious and sad parts don't feel tremendously sad because, as said, everything is conveyed through letters, memos and telegrams, so the book has a light, chatty feel.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for a few hours of charming, chatty, entertaining reading, then this is the best example of it I've found in a long, long time.Even the serious and sad parts don't feel tremendously sad because, as said, everything is conveyed through letters, memos and telegrams, so the book has a light, chatty feel.

B0001XALT6|4.0|It's fair to say that many of the characters are superficial and the plot is predictable. But this movie gets better each year - not as a piece of art but as a \\"Hollywood Party\\" guest list to rival *any* \\"star-studded\\" semi-epic in movie history.<br /><br />By 2010, we can enjoy watching Scorsese players romp with \\"Sopranos\\" players in the lush playground of North Eastern Hudson County, New Jersey! A terrific chance to watch Keitel mix it up with De Niro (ah, what memories of \\"Taxi Driver\\"); and Cathy Moriarity reunite with Bobby D. - wish they had a scene together! She looks like she aged maybe...ten pounds in 15 years! I don't understand the level of her worldweariness - she's one of three female characters who deal with difficult dudes; one being, Jeanine Garofalo, not very convincing as a Cop, but with a good \\"feel\\" as the disenchanted feminist from upstate New York. Bruce Springsteen songs lend a little texture to the gray cinematography; and the all the angry agitation.<br /><br />When Sly's Deputy decides to chill on him right about when he's most vulnerable, when he decides face his enemies just after sunrise, we know someone's been watching \\"High Noon\\".<br /><br />Script does get a bit melodramatic and once or twice I had to suppress a laugh - had too much respect for Stallone to laugh when Kietel grimaced through one too many soliliques about how he found a haven for corrupt New York City cops. But overall, I would say, this is the best acting I've ever watched from Harvey Keitel.<br /><br />Ray Liotta looks healthy, about five years past his Henry Hill role; has many good scenes, though just once I wish he'd take off that sweaty long-sleeved shirt and put on a cool, tropical short-sleeve. With all the perks of hanging out in Harvey's mecca, it seems no-one can afford an air-conditioner!<br /><br />Likewise, this might actually be Sylvester Stallone's strongest performance. It seems he added some weight to his frame - maybe DeNiro gave him some pointers on how he ballooned up as Jake LaMotta!
B001FB4W0W|1.0|While I thought the books were funny , somewhat mediocre,granted, but still entertaining -what HBO did to them is more than degrading!Glad she made money on that, hope she stashed some - because I for one will NEVER purchase a book with her name on it again, let alone watch something that is supposedly based on her books and has nothing to do with them.I feel sorry for a few of the actors (some of them are really good )- they will get a bad wrap because of this hunk of junk.  I read a lot - but I don't think I have ever come across an author that would let others dictate the scripts to their characters. I'm sure I can get 5 bucks for season 1 in a flea market, but the books will have to go in the trash!
1416914307|4.0|This is what the previous books have been leading us to - the end of the trilogy and all our questions answered. City of Glass in one word: Action. Not non-stop, but a heavy amount and it's necessary. The final face-off with Valentine was destined to be bloody and fans won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Clary and Jace, oh where to start? Their \\"romantic\\" story line does get closure, but of a little too predictable nature. From almost the very beginning I think most people had a feeling how this was going to turn out. Every piece of the puzzle led us and the big shock had less power than it should have had. I'm an adult, made common sense observations and probably read the books searching for clues that made the resolution of the romance less surprising that someone who is reading the book at face value. It was all there, hinting and leading to the end, but probably was only obvious to people who go looking for these things.<br /><br />There were some truly wonderful heartfelt moments and the overall plot was wrapped up nicely. Clary, Jace and the rest of the major players spent most of the book in Idris and getting to experience the much talked about place was very interesting. Readers also get an even closer look at the workings of the Clave which is where most of the surprises in City of Glass stem from.<br /><br />The book was not without its heartbreaking occurrences, but nothing was truly monumental in that area. Sadness, yes. Tears, not so much. City of Glass does a wonderful job of completing the trilogy. Most importantly, for me at least, we get to see Alec and Magnus finally decide what's going on between them. Awesome. This was definitely the best book in the series for me.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the story isn't quite over. The fourth book in the trilogy (yes, you read that right), City of Fallen Angels, is scheduled to be released in 2011. There's no work where the story is heading now, but my guess is we'll be seeing a lot more of the Clave, Simon and the rest of the downworlders.
030726999X|3.0|This is by far the weakest entry in the \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" series.  I understand the reluctance to criticize given that this was the author's final work.  As I was reading this I had a feeling that the author never finished this one and it was thrown together by ghost writers but when I completed the novel I had the feeling that he finished it but never really started it.<br />In other words, the book is so slow to get going with so many characters introduced, long rambling descriptions of how Swedish government works and scandals past that nothing really happens until about halfway through the book other than a lot of rehashing of what happened in the previous books.  If you take this one on and haven't read the 2 previous novels....well good luck with that!  If you have read the previous 2 novels you really don't need to have them rehashed over and over in this one (but they are).<br /><br />I thought \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" lived up to the hype.  The story was unpredictable, well written, creative and the characters memorable.  In \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\", Lisbeth Salander is transformed into a a comic book character and I found myself rolling my eyes many times and thinking \\"right....sure...she's got an I.Q. of 180 and at 90lbs can beat up big boys on motorbikes because she's also a chickboxer extraordinaire.\\"  In this book we already know that she's smarter and tougher than everyone else and we're just waiting for her to explode or at least to do something or say something that makes her character interesting and not just unbelievable.  I'm no expert on the Swedish Court system but it seems highly unlikely that people not on the stand can just blurt out testimony or answer questions posed to them by attorneys sitting at their side while somebody elses is sworn in and testifying.<br /><br />While the second half of this book is entertaining it's not enough to bring this novel anywhere near the level of the first book in the series.  I think it's worth reading but I'm not sure it was worth writing.'m not sure it was worth writing.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I was fortunate enough to go to one of the Troubador concerts and every time I listen to this CD it brings back wonderful memories of the concert and also memories of listening to them in the 1970's.  Have not had the chance to view the DVD yet, but have no doubt it's great.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Cant think of a better purchase for a history buff! Even for the casual viewer this series is so interesting that I would rather watch this than any of the new movies coming out these days. It is exciting, gripping and real - makes you feel like a part of the War. The footage is scary and can throw some people off because it is graphic. You learn so much from each episode and Laurene O's narrations is simply amazing. Buy this...you will not regret it!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|For all us 50 somethings, this album will bring you back to your teen years. James Taylor and Carole King are at their finest in this album. I saw the concert live and each time I listen to this CD, it brings me back to that night. Great songs, great banter between the artists, a classic!
B00004STPT|4.0|The movie was great, just seems to me the sound track was a little let down after watching the movie, only music worth the whole cd price was the last piece.
B002ZG98M8|4.0|I don't get out to the theater much, so when my 9 and 11 year olds suggested we go to the movies on a hot and rainy Sunday, I thought it would be a nice way to spend the day with the kids. \\"So what'll it be boys? [[ASIN:B00275EHJQ Toy Story 3]]? [[ASIN:B002ZG97EC Despicable Me]]?\\" Their reply in unison: \\"PREDATORS!!!\\" Actually I wasn't at all surprised since lately they've been spending most of their video game time online with [[ASIN:B001TOMQSK Aliens vs Predator]]. Truthfully I couldn't have been happier with their choice because that's really what I wanted to see most too.<br /><br />In the end no one was disappointed. Predators is a great action movie that not only pays homage to [[ASIN:B003L16FAE the original]], but brings the Predator franchise back to the brutal violence and fast moving story telling that made the first one a classic. Kudos to Director Nimr&oacute;d Antal and Producer Robert Rodriguez for not making any of the plethora of mistakes that were made with the sub-par [[ASIN:B001VFM0YW Predator 2]] or any of the [[ASIN:B00147F8ZA AvP]] movies.<br /><br />All the action looked real. All of the Predators (and other monsters) looked real. All of the acting is really good. Although I must say that I had a hard time swallowing Adrian Brody as the lead tough guy. Brody comes across as more of a softy to me. If I had to seek out a complaint it might be that Brody was a bit miscast, but not so much so that it took away from the thoroughly entertaining experience that I had with Predators.<br /><br />The story is very similar to the first one. A group of mostly soldiers (or soldier types) are in a mysterious jungle and soon realize that there's a role reversal going on: they are no longer hunters, mercenaries or whatever; they are the hunted. And they are going to need a lot of firepower and strategy in order to walk away alive from the situation that they are in.<br /><br />I guess if I had to \\"unEarth\\" another negative it would be that the storyline is quite familiar. But Antal and Rodriguez introduce enough new concepts and twists to keep this sequel pretty fresh looking and not as predictable as you may think. If you were a big fan of the 1987 cult classic like I was, I believe that you'll find that this 2010 reintroduction to the Predators will be a welcome one...like it was for me.<br /><br />A few words of caution to anyone that saw my comment about bringing the kids to this movie: it is not a family film. It earns its R rating. I'm just a little more liberal when it comes to what I think will warp the little minds of today's youth. So use your discretion.introduce enough new concepts and twists to keep this sequel pretty fresh looking and not as predictable as you may think.

0307594777|5.0|Sometimes something comes along that deserves six or seven stars.  These three works fall into that category.  I read them on my iPad and lost a lot of sleep doing so.  Fortunately the iPad is well lit and didn't keep my other half awake.  I haven't been cought up in work like this in years.  Will now go through the films and the biographical material that is available.  Larsson has created a hero in Lisbeth Salander who is realistic and appealing despite her supposed antisocial ways.  She has reason to be so.  It's also compelling to delve into some real Swedish history and see the dark side of this admirable socialist state.  I had never realized that so many folks found Nazism appealing during WWII.  I was motivated to read some Swedish history while I was reading these books.  Stieg Larsson makes me proud of my Swedish ancestry.

0307474712|2.0|One thing is certain: David Nicholls is an adept humor writer. There are plenty of amusing moments and sharp one-liners to be found in \\"One Day.\\" Another mark in Nicholls' favor is that he understands how complicated life can be. His characters screw up (sometimes repeatedly), do unlikeable things (and quite frequently), and so his novel is lifted above standard romantic comedy offerings. I can certainly see why so many people enjoy this book so very much. But if I'm being completely honest I must admit that I am not one of those people, despite the good points I just mentioned.<br /><br />My main problem with this book is that Nicholls takes the disagreeable components of several characters a little too far. Dexter (or Dex, as he is frequently called) goes from being the person you like \\"in an ironic, tongue-in-cheek, love-to-hate kind of way\\" (in the words of his agent) to someone you (or at least I) can't abide somewhere around the hundred page mark. It's one thing that some of the minor characters are irritating, but it's quite another when you just can't stand one half of your romantic pair. Dex is the kind of self-involved, pleasure-seeking guy you are meant to love anyway because his charisma is winning and his heart, well, might just be filled with good intentions, even if they rarely-to-never get realized. He's the kind of guy who would actually take the time to wonder that \\"he wasn't sure that struggle suited him\\" when pondering a career path. Indeed, the only reason he wants a career at all is so that he can have a line to impress women with (and since \\"Hi, nice to meet you, I'm an astronaut\\" isn't in the cards he'll just have to fall back on television). This much is amusing, but when his self-absorption leads him to angrily think to himself that \\"he has better things to do\\" then be at his beloved mother's deathbed, it goes too far.<br /><br />Disclaimer time. I am not callous. I am well aware of how difficult it can be to deal with a parent's serious illness because I have personal experience in the matter. I am also well aware of the fact that Dex thinking he has better things to do is meant to reflect his inability to emotionally process the impending death of his mother so soon after he has graduated from college. Here's my problem with this: in the first hundred and fifty pages of the novel it becomes abundantly clear that Dex is meant to be on a long path to recovery. Not just from his own self-absorption, but from the more literal excessive drinking and drug use that begin to plague him immediately after graduation. OK, I have two problems with this--the first is that when things continue in the same vein I just wished he would hit rock bottom so we could get to the healing, already, but since there were still three hundred pages left it was apparent that absolute rock bottom was a ways off. By the time he gets left alone with a baby and predictably can't keep away from the liquor cabinet I just wanted to throw the book across the room. The second, and much larger of my problems with this novel, is that it is clear that it is up to poor, sweet Emma to save him.<br /><br />This isn't, at heart, a story about Dexter and Emma--or it is, but only insofar as Emma is the only person with the capacity to affect real change in Dex. In the end, the love story in \\"One Day\\" is secondary to Dexter's story. Emma is reduced to (eventually) acting as the vehicle for his recovery. So her story stagnates. She can't fall in love, because if she did there wouldn't be any room for Dexter in her life. Who, after all, needs so much unnecessary drama anyway? We are meant to believe that Emma can't fall in love because she has already fallen, irretrievably, for Dex. I'm sure this point just screams to the romantic in a lot of readers that like this book. Well, I'm a romantic, too (believe it or not at this point), and this just didn't do it for me. Emma's total love for Dex is inexplicable. It doesn't make sense. And I'm well awarethat life itself rarely makes sense, but this went overboard to me. They have nothing in common. You can tell me that opposites attract as much as you want, and I will believe you, but I still won't see how Dex and Emma could ever be considered a matched pair. And the fact that Emma is expected to wait around just to save Dexter when he's ready isn't romantic, it's insulting.<br /><br />I can't discuss the ending here, but I will say that I found it to be EXTREMELY manipulative. I might have been more willing to forgive my complaints about this book had it ended differently. But I don't want to give anything away for anyone who wants to read this book, so I will say no more.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks you will probably love this. I have seen frequent comparisons to When Harry Met Sally, a movie that I absolutely adore, but I don't think they hold true. Harry and Sally are clearly meant for each other, even when they bicker upon first meeting, and I see no such chemistry in Dex and Emma. There are also many comparisons to Same Time Next Year, but as I have neither seen the movie nor read the play I cannot say how they stack up.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning, I can see why so many people have enjoyed this book and are undoubtedly looking forward to the movie version. I just don't get it.<br />Grade: Dmakes sense, but this went overboard to me. They have nothing in common.

It has his humble beginnings and goes up to the incredible stuff he's done for Wonder Woman and Catwoman covers. Adam was always the guy that was at the conventions back in the day and would always sign your comic, I'm happy that he has become what he is now and this can be seen through out this book. The book includes sketches and alternate sketches to some of his best covers. I say this book is a must have for any Adam Hughes fan! You won't regret it!

Heaven knows that Amazon is big enough to change this situation.

B000002AS3|5.0|While Noel Gallagher has endured a lot of unjustified criticism for his songwriting (wearing your influences on your sleeve isn't always a BAD thing) Oasis' stunning debut is a strong argument in his favor, if you want to consider him for the title of \\"greatest pop songwriter since Lennon & McCartney\\". Every song on this classic LP could have been a single and yet they work together well in the context of the album as a whole, a rare feat. \\"Shakermaker\\" never sounds old!

B002G1K82Q|5.0|This was one of my favorites DVDs, and I just upgraded to the Blu-ray version which looks fantastic. First of all, I am a life-long fan of the Beatles' music, but believe me, if the movie sucks I don't care how good the music is, it still sucks. I actually avoided this movie because I hate it when other people try to perform their music, the same way I don't like tribute bands or Elvis impersonators, etc. Somewhere I saw the black soloist and choir from the movie performing their version of \\"Let It Be\\", and I was so blown away I decided to rent the movie. Each time I watch it I'm blown away again with the creative genius it took to make this;  the story line is credible, you really care about the characters, and it's the ONLY time I've ever heard Beatles songs redone in a good way.  While you don't have to be a fan to enjoy the movie, you might have to have lived through that decade to fully appreciate what the director succeeded in doing:  taking a decade that has become almost a cliche and making it fresh through the music of just one band.<br /><br />Incidentally, my grown son happened to drop by while this was on and was so intrigued he wanted to see it from the beginning. This is a guy who came up with Snoop Dog, Bob Marley and Tupac, to name a few of his favorites, and prefers typical \\"guy\\" movies (action, explosions, fighting, gangsters). He really liked this movie!<br /><br />Others have given very thorough reviews so I won't.  I just didn't want people to be scared away from trying this movie because of the reviewer who dismissed it as just a bunch of Beatles music and a nude scene.  That couldn't be further from the truth, and in fact if you're not a fan of the Beatles you might just find you like their music the way these guys have done it.  They did it that well.
B001U7B4T8|3.0|Very good but incomplete because it doesn't include the following: Chrissie Hyde, I Shall Be Released; Neil Young, All Along The Watchtower; Johnny Cash/June Carter Cash, It Ain't Me Babe; Lou Reed, Foot Of Pride; My Back Pages; Tom Petty, License to Kill and several others on the 30 Anniversary Concert Celebration. Just thinking about those  Chrissie Hyde's and Neil Young's missing songs, it probably deserves only 2 stars.

B002ZG980U|5.0|It's rare these days for a movie to come together on so many different levels, but Inception has it all. A great soundtrack that really sucks you in and sets the mood, spectacular visuals that aren't saturated with obvious CGI, a complex story that isn't hard to follow as long as you are paying attention, and the human element of emotion that was believable and moving.    It also has a killer fight scene that was beautifully executed.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|The movie both visually and the audio track are amazing the best we've seen so far but with the story of the movie it just felt like a sci-fi version of the Last Samurai.  A little case in point we have a brave dedicated but broken soldier who is dissatisfied with the way his life has turned out now is given a new option to use his skills again though the choice brings some reluctance for the character to make but ultimately he does choose to do so,  and after integrating with the indigenous people begins to cultivate their lifestyle into his own seeing it as a much more better way to live then at first he thought.  Of course we can't have this kind of movie without the main male character falling in love with the one of the very people/alien he is working against to undermined,  and of course you can't have this kind of movie without the near cynical skilled military leader and the the soldiers under him trying to remove the problem that obstructs him from completing his assignment objective.  It's a little sad as you watch the movie because since most of the characters are one dimensional you pretty much know what their going to do during this crisis as well as the enemies, friends and allies they make throughout the movie.  The effects are astounding and the background is visually stunning but after that for any original plot design or characters don't expect much in that area  but again with Hollywood writers who have no originality anyway that's sadly expected nowadays.  So go ahead and get the movie for your home library today,  though it doesn't have any originality in story or character design it's still has enough to make it worth looking at...

0812548094|5.0|I just finished WFR, and had to start reading this immediately. Since I had been introduced to the series from watching Legend of the Seeker, I knew that the TV series grabbed from all over the books, and was eager to see how things played out in the novel. To my surprise, almost all of this was different than the second season of the TV show, and that was a pleasant surprise. It's a shame that the fans of the books didn't support the TV show - because for anyone who started with the TV show and then read the books afterwards, it's like having Goodkind's world expanded.

B000THDHYU|5.0|This review of the CD on this page is for a single CD remix, and not the 3-CD boxed set. Both the single CD remix and the box set were released in 1990, to note the original 1970 album's twentieth anniversary.<br /><br />Titled, \\"The Layla Sessions: 20th Anniversary Edition,\\" this CD is a remix of the original LP, and contains the same tracks. They were remixed in stereo from the 16-track analog  tapes and digitally remastered. This 1990 CD remix was issued by Polydor as a single CD as well as a 3-CD box set.<br /><br />The first disc in the 3-CD set is the same as his single CD. Disc 2 contains several tracks of jam sessions, including the historic jam from the night that Clapton and Allman met. Disc 3 contains out-takes of some of their songs as well as previously unreleased tracks, including \\"Mean Old World,\\" \\"It Hurts Me Too,\\" and \\"Tender Love.\\"<br /><br />I hope this helps to clear up some misinformation that has previously been posted on this page.<br /><br />As for a review of this CD album, the music holds the same hypnotic energy for me today as it did when it was released twenty years ago. Every cut on this CD is sensational. The album has continued to be on my list of Top 10 albums to bring to the dessert, island, or whatever. Every group member performed in top form when these recording sessions were made. By the way, when \\"Layla\\" was released as a single, it became a \\"hit\\" on American radio, and was the first recording of its length to do so.<br /><br />Sadly, we lost Duane not too long after these sessions took place. We will always have this recording to remember the brilliant musicians who came together for a brief moment in time.

B001DDBCUU|2.0|The series ended perfectly!  Yet they couldn't leave well enough alone. Noooo, they had to milk this for all they could.  Not a bad business decision, but why oh why did they have to ruin what was a good thing.    First of all, the best thing about Sex and the City was the bond of friendship between these women.  This completely goes out the window in the film.  Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen this - one of the girl's significant other ends up cheating on her. So of coarse the other girls feel her heartbreak and are very supportive as they were in the series with one another right?  WRONG!  The film makes a real about face from the series.  Instead of her \\"friends\\" supporting her decision to leave the guy, they instead end up ganging up on her and stating that she should just get over the fact that he cheated on her already & that it was a \\"mistake\\"; that she should stop acting silly and forget about it and go back to him.  Then they go on to pretty much blaming her for the incident and calling her a moron for not putting up with being cheated on & not forgiving him for his little \\"mistake\\".  Accidentally dropping a jar of pasta is a mistake... putting your penis in another woman is hardly an accidental occurance.  That right there told me that this was NOT a script written by a woman.  I shudder to think about how many women in adulterous relationships actually remained in one after watching this film (because believe it or not there are women out there who look onto these characters as role-models) when three of the girls ganged up on the poor woman who's heart was broken.      Also- the costuming was atrocious.  Sex and the city always had wonderful wardrobes, but here it was like they were trying too hard to make all the main characters look 'fabulous.'  The colors were often too bright. This was especially apparent on Miranda who wears colors that a partner in a NY lawfirm would never wear.  She NEVER dressed like that in the series.  In the series she dressed with style, while also dressing the way a NY lawyer like Miranda would dress.  Carrie at one time wears a HUGE top full of feathers.  What did, a gay guy who thinks fashion is more important than making the characters make sense direct this film??  It was ridiculous.    There's more I could talk about, but I'm trying to keep this review short.  With how wonderful the series was and ended, I refuse to think of this as the last harrah.  To me- the last episode of the series is the real end as it should be.
B00026ZG10|5.0|James Cameron's True Lies has it all--international intrigue, double identities, a secret government organization, a  bored homemaker and secretary, an apparently good husband who's a computer salesman, a fourteen year daughter with issues, a beautiful antiquities dealer, a faithful sidekick, and a terrorist who wants America out of the Middle East.  When you toss in, a police horse, the tango, an apparent used car salesman who moonlights as an international man of danger and mystery, car and helicopter chases, stolen Russian nuclear warheads, the Florida Keys, Miami, and a marine jet, you have a great film.  There is plenty of James Bond type action to keep the adrenalin flowing.    You have a tremendous cast--Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Arnold, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tia Carrere,  a young Eliza Dushku, Art Malik,  and the great Charlton Heston.  A special mention has to be made of Bill Paxton.  His Simon/ Carlos character is a riot to watch.  And the red sports car-ideal tool for his secret agent man.    The chase in the Ambassador Hotel between horse and motorcycle is one well crafted sequence--full of suspense and humor, especially the horse.  The chase on the Seven Mile Bridge is pure excitement with trucks, a limo, helicopters, jets, and explosions.    Film awards include--the Golden Globe for Best Actress; Saturn Award for Best Actress, Director and Special Effects; American Comedy for Best Actress; and the ASCAP Award for best composer.  There a number of other nominations as well.  Jamie Lee Curtis deserved all of these acting awards!    So, if you have 141 minutes and want to escape from your daily routine, then watch this film.
B000U1ZV3U|2.0|Wyatt Earp is Kevin Costner's bio-pic answer to the film he was originally supposed to star in, Tombstone. It is said that Wyatt Earp is more documentary-like than Hollywood movie. However, at the end of the day, Wyatt Earp fails to entertain or keep the interest of its audience for it ridiculous 3-hour running time.<br /><br />First off, I have to commend the film for its use of Michael Madsen, Linden Ashby & Mark Harmon in particular. All three actor, while playing smaller roles, all to very well with what they have, putting up some solid performances. The cast is littered with recognizable names, and for the most part, everybody does the best with what they got. Actors like Jeff Fahey are underused, but they're usually still solid. The same can not be said for the main characters, however. Kevin Costner is for better and for worse Kevin Costner, not really doing anything with the character apart from what's on the page, often giving a distractingly tonal difference between the two sides of Wyatt Earp. Gene Hackman phones in a performance that asks little of him than to be wise. And even though he's in the movie a grand total of five minutes, he gets 2nd or 3rd billing. As for Dennis Quaid, he gives one of the most overwrought accents in recent memory with his portrayal of Doc Holiday. Sounding like a cross between the Rooster from the Looney Tunes & Colonel Sanders, Doc Holiday is a black hole of personality thats defining characteristic seems to be his only friendship with Wyatt Earp because he has TB. On his own, Quaid's Doc Holiday isn't that interesting, but compared to Val Kilmer's classic portrayal of Holiday, there isn't even a contest. Kilmer wins by sheer default.<br /><br />Then there's how to film views women. Every one of the various wives in this film is portrayed as little more than a winy shrew that will steal a gun and fire it at their man if they're the least bit angry. And they happen to be angry a lot. They get mad when Wyatt moves the family asking why 'the brothers need to stick together.' They get mad when Wyatt does what Wyatt does with the \\"Cowboy\\" gang. One gets mad when her husband is cheating on her even though they're not technically married. Not to mention the sheer lack of any personality found in Wyatt's other two girlfriends/lovers/wives to begin with.<br /><br />Then there's the long, drawn-out story. Covering most of the highlights in Earp's life up until Tombstone, the movie has a certain fondness for dropping you in the middle of a situation where nobody seems very happy. They literally jump in time where things are supposed to be better, only to show you that things are not going better. For example, when Earp announces he's moving the family to Tombstone, literally the next scene is the wives complaining that they were moved to Tombstone and thing are the same as they always were, to which one of the brother's respond, \\"It's not for lack of trying!\\" Wait, how did you get here again? The movie has a fondness for doing this, leaving very little connection from scene to scene. You're left extremely confused about Earp before & after the Tombstone incident. Why is everybody mad at the guy? Why did he \\"pick\\" the fight anyways? In fact, general lack of cohesion makes this movie an overall frustrating watch.<br /><br />Overall, with shoddy stunts, writing, story, motive, main characters, and other problems with most everything else, Wyatt Earp is a forgettable mess that's not the epic the movie is advertised as, unless they meant epically bad and uninteresting. As a stand-alone film, it doesn't work. When compared to Tombstone, it's wiped off the floor in almost every respect.rothers need to stick together.'

1400052173|5.0|\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" ties together science, social justice, ethics, impressive journalism, and wonderful \\"storytelling\\". This nonfiction book describes the origin of the first effective in vitro cell line (HeLa cells) from a poor black woman. The main story documents the science behind cell culture; the origin of laws that protect human subjects; and the failure of scientists to provide adequate explanations to the poorly educated family members of the \\"donor\\", who felt used and abused by biomedical science. The side stories tell about life in the rural south as tobacco farmers, scraping to make ends meet by putting the entire family to work; life in the slums of Philadelphia plagued by child abuse, drugs, and violence; and the challenges for many poorly educated citizens to understand modern medicine, technology, and economics.     In short, \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is a compelling book about the interface of science and society, written for the general public but a wonderful \\"read\\" for both nonscientists and scientists alike. Every budding scientist should read this book to gain insight into the origin and importance of regulations governing research on humans.
B003A03RRU|4.0|This version is complete and ver enjoyable.  However there are spelling mistakes and there are no graphics!  Very frustrating to read graphics heavy stories such as &#34;The Dancing Men&#34; but there are sufficiently few stories like this to make it tolerable.
0385333846|5.0|I just finished this book today. I worked at Borders Bookstore and this book was often on the list of many students. I was always put off by this and scratched it off my list to read (huge mistake on my part) I no longer work at Borders and recently I picked up this book. I cannot begin to tell you what a fan I am of Kurt Vonnegut. It was a pure pleasure to read this book and the writing was something that took me away. There are some great reviews on this book-so I will not attempt to write my own. I can say, Vonnegut is a genius and all his books have a way of writing that bring a reader back to his books.
B00074CBIS|5.0|Taxi is another movie for the 2fast2Furious crowd. A bumbling cop teams with a taxi driver who has sport-tuned her taxi into a BMW-killing machine! If you like Fast&Furious, Smokey and the Bandit, or any car chase movie, this is one to certainly add to your collection!
0783223218|2.0|Before I say anything I would like to warn everyone that there are possible SPOILERS in what I will put down. Not big plot killers, just some minor spoilers. This movie is like the Bourne Identity in some ways, only, not nearly as well executed...in fact it's not nearly as well...ANYTHING.     I jotted down a few flaws while watching the movie. I was expecting something significantly better but unfortunately have been very disappointed.    1. I don't believe the story ever explains why the Jackal is called that. It just comes out of the blue and therefore demeans the title of the movie even more.    2. The killing of Jack Black. Jack Black is a pretty likable actor and the way he died, I personally felt was out of character. Killing a likable well known actor is a bit risky, especially when he mainly deals with comedy.     3. One of the most severe and devastating flaw in this movie is Richard Gere. He's a decent guy but I do not favor him or his pathetic accent in this movie. Because of this, I ended up actually rooting for the villain of the movie, Bruce Willis, who is a significantly more likable character in my personal opinion. Richard Gere's acting in this movie is not to a satisfactory level sufficient enough to sustain and maintain his character. Basically what I'm saying is that he does not fit the movie. If I were the director, I'd replace him with an unknown other. Sorry, but Richard Gere as a die hard action guy? Yeah right. Maybe in drama and romance movies, but secret agent/ CIA/ Police type movies that require good, fast, awesome action scenes....no way. Watching lame o Richard Gere bored me out of my mind, he has no charisma.     4. 80-90% of the movie contains static, uninteresting scenes that move the movie along, but does not make it appealing and interesting to the viewer. You watch Bruce Willis set up everything, but there's not much to watch. There's nothing to excite the viewer inbetween so you end up slightly falling asleep, hoping that the movie would just get on with something more significant.     5. Bruce Willis's face is extremely pronounced, unique and distinguishable, therefore no matter what disguise he wears, you can easily tell it is Bruce Willis in this movie. Another flaw in this movie. You can't make Bruce Willis become some sort of top secret super assassin with his lame get-ups and fake costumes that he uses to fool people to think he's someone else. Bruce Willis with a little bit of blond hair is STILL Bruce Willis, who the heck is he trying to fool with that $5 getup? Seriously.....it's a joke!    6. The whole movie Bruce Willis travels in a mini van. Therefore everyone is trying to track down a mini van. Could he NOT have gotten a different car like an SUV???    7. The laughable ending is not only predictable, but typical. Watch it for yourself, I won't spoil this because it'll just be too much.    8. The cast is pretty much filled with not so interesting group of characters....      This and a ton of other flaws, again this is like the Bourne Identity, only if you had a choice I'd suggest Bourne. The action is lame, if you heard otherwise, they're probably lying or they have no idea what they're talking about. Will not watch again unless desperate.
6300214540|5.0|Top Gun is one of my favorite movies ever made. Some of the best jetfights ever caught on film whether real or fake. This is \\"Firefox\\" and \\"Airwolf\\", FOR REAL! This is as accurate as it gets with dogfights in Tomcats although the \\"Migs\\" weren't really Migs. One of the best Tom Cruise movies ever made. This will make you want to join the Air Force(they were Navy pilots but the Air Force is more well-known for airpower)! Highest recommendation possible!
B003ICWTR4|5.0|A knock your socks off performance filmed at Hyde Park, London, England. Bruce and the E Street band are going like \\"60\\" and never show their age.
B000008M1P|5.0|Vixen is one of the best female bands ever. Too often compared to Heart. Heart WISHES they could rock this hard! Vixen will remind you of Lita Ford with a Poison/Stryper like sound. 80's style rock/metal with GORGEOUS women in the band!
B00003CXB4|4.0|The shipping time initially given was a month away. The product was sent in earlier but no email updates or information was given.
B00005R87Q|5.0|The sport-tuner craze started with this movie. Although Smokey and the Bandit can claim the cop car-killing original movie, Fast&Furious adds sport tuning to the genre. Lancers, Civics, Supras, and S2000's are for starters(no pun intended to the engine component!)! Jettas, classic muscle cars, Ram trucks, and others tricked out too destroy the competition in races is what this movie is about. Vin Diesel came to prominence in Hollywood after this movie leading him to XXX, Riddick,etc. This is a sport tuning (cult?Dare I say it?!) movie that is already a classic in my mind.
B001HN694K|5.0|i loved the whole movie from where it started from where it ended my brother heared it wasnt good i thought it was awesome one of my favorite movies ever top of 100 movies i get it 95% percent but i also like movies like these and kids movies iam very picky but you guys have to see this movie my brother friend said it sux but its awesome :)
B00005JM4Z|5.0|Miami Vice meets Vin Diesel(not in this movie) in the second movie of the Fast&Furious series. One caucasian and one African-American  team up to take down a high-class criminal with the help of Ludacris and Eva Mendes along with several tricked out cars and classic American muscle as well. If you like cop movies and/or car chase movies, this is a must-have!
B002WYH5N2|5.0|No, really, and I've seen them all. Of course this is my learned opinion so read at your own risk. Keira Knightly - excellent. Actually most of the cast (Bingley was a little too goofy) were terrific.     For the critics that say Macfayden was a little too wooden,they had a point in two or three places at most. But it doesn't detract from his overall portrayal. He never looked maudlin or sappy even once - unlike Colin Firth at the last third of the A&E version. No trashing me now, I love that one too. But Macfayden came across as a real, believable person. So did Donald Sutherland and I was prepared to dislike him from the first. Instead,I was charmed!    Indeed, I'm one of those dedicated little P&P fans who has the book memorized. I can say with all true feeling that Matthew Macfayden is better then the Darcy version that's lived in my head for the last 30 years.    And that's sayin' somethin'.  :)
B00000AFFI|4.0|All of PJ Harvey's favorite subjects come up again on Is This Desire?: death, sex, obssession, and tragic women. And it works beautifully. Unlike her previous albums though, Is This Desire? has a much quieter, more subdued sound. A softer side of her voice takes center stage here, but she still sounds just as powerful as ever.   The reason it didn't get 5 stars is that some of the songs just don't seem as solid as others and just seem to fall a little flat on comparison. Angelene,A Perfect Day Elise, The Wind, Catherine, The Garden, Joy, and The River are some of the best though.   It may not be my favorite PJ Harvey album, but it's still very good and very much worth buying.
B003JIPJRE|3.0|Just watched this and the story and animation are excellent.  Even if you have read the story already, this does really bring it to life quite well.  So, you might be wondering why give it such praise for only a 3 Star rating.  The voice acting is why.  Neil Patrick Harris and Jensen Ackles both delivered excellent voice work here that I expected from NPH, but was pleasantly surprised by Mr. Ackles.  The Joker's voice was really bad, the laugh was pretty good, but the dialogue was awful.  This guy was just not right for Joker unless all he did was laugh.  Alfred was completely out of place, bad casting.  Batman's voice was ok.  There were times when it was wrong, and there were a handful of times when it was right.  It did not feel as though it had the weight of Batman for almost the whole film.  It was not awful, but it really makes you appreciate Kevin Conroy's excellence in delivering both Bruce Wayne's billionaire cover and Batman's tortured soul through his work.  In this great story, Batman sounded as though he never felt weighed down by what was in front of him.  I am sure these people are nice people and tried to do an excellent job, it just was not a good fit for them.      Summary:  Amazing story with great art work that unfortunately had a few voices that immediately make you disconnect and drop the illusion that otherwise had cast a powerful spell allowing you to let go and truly believe in this world and story.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I looked high and low and wasted money on other products until I found this one!  I wanted a sturdy belt clip, primarily.  The arm band was secondary.  I am very pleased with this purchase.    The belt clip is sturdy, made of good quality material and clips very securely.  My ipod does not move while I'm running, and I am not concerned that it is going to fall out of the case.    I use headphones with an L shaped jack and haven't had any problems with the case extending just slightly beyond the edge of the ipod.  It is truly a very slight extension and just offers a tad bit more protection, in my opinion.  I have not needed to make any adjustments to use this product.  It works as described!
030726999X|3.0|It took a while to get into the story.  I don't think it was as good as the 2 previous books, but it does bring the whole saga to a conclusion.
B0014H32MG|4.0|I LOVE YOU STEPHEN!!!!! It dawned on me that we are all running men, being followed by guards who keep us in line - buying the right cars, living in the right homes, spending, spending, working, working. . . When we get to the end will we be afraid to stop and collect our winnings?
B001U7FWM8|5.0|I enjoy such a large variety of music that I was  shocked when my partner found this cd to be strange, and my son found it depressing. I think it is really great and the music is a good fusion of alternative rock and great harmonies, that I had to get it. I was a little late hearing about this band, because I sometimes get stuck in some of the older stuff, but I must admit this one is a keeper.  The guys did well on this one.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|This was a movie that I had on VHS I decided to collect it on DVD so that I would have it
B00005R5G9|1.0|Got the product on a timely basis, however, a few minutes into the dvd it freezes and stops.  Returned for a replacement and have not yet received.  I did receive another dvd from the same supplier that works fine.  Things happen, testing the product before shipment would be beneficial to all.  Supplier indicated that they would credit my credit card.  Don't want a credit I want a dvd that works. This is a future present.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Heath Ledger gives an epic performance. Moves quickly, drama and suspense are well done - you're never bored. Nice camera work, good acting - as usual Zimmer provides a great score. All around a great movie.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|Thanks so much! The movie came within just a few days which was much sooner than I expected. It looked great and didn't have any scratches on the disc. All I had to do was take off the stickers and sticker residue and it was good to go! If I want to purchase another Blu-Ray in the future I would buy from you again.
B000V8A31C|4.0|Nice simple music - pleasant to listen to. Makes you want to learn to play piano. Much more meaningful and moving if you've seen the film.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|I am no music critic but I know what I like.  I love John Wetton; his lyrics and voice.  Downes is an amazing keyboard player and song writer.  Howe maybe the best guitarist for commercial songs and Palmer is a throw back to the days when drumming was important.  Individually they are terrific but collectively only Paul and John were better song writers.  Their lyrics and music can take you to a deeper place in your soul.  Phoenix had some great songs but was slightly short of what I desired.  I actually thought a couple of the ICON (Wetton/Downes) albums were as good or better.  Omega is terrific.  It really feels as if these guys put it all together for an complete album.  The only thing that concerns me is the title.  If this is their last CD then I am troubled.  I realize they are older, we all are, but they are important to me.  There new music is a highlight to me in a troubled world.  I hope you enjoy this great album.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|I am not really a Taylor Swift fan, but after listening to this album.  It was very good.  The songs didn't register to me until 'Love Story' and 'You Belong With Me', after the controversy of Taylor vs Carrie Underwood's music.  I think she is going to make it, so if you are looking for a good Country Album.  This is it.  Go Taylor!
0061537934|5.0|A wonderful, insightful story about about a loving compasionate soul that just happened to reside in a dogs body and his people capanions.
B001EN71DG|4.0|I grew up on Star Wars, having seen all of the original films in the theater when I was a child.  In 1997 I was excited to hear Lucas was updating the trilogy with the \\"Special Editions\\" containing new footage and effects.  Let's just say by the end of it all my opinion of the Special Editions soured and I don't wish to view those versions of these films again.      Thankfully, the original 1977 - 1983 theatrical versions are included with this DVD box set.  The format is not spectacular, being lower in resolution than the Special Edition trilogy included in the set, but at this point us Star Wars purists will take what we can get.    These versions really stand the test of time.  While George Lucas may disagree, I think the special effects hold up well and that the flaws only add to the charm.   These films certainly feel more alive than the prequels as they were filmed using live actors against real sets.  I don't want to get into a fit of Lucas bashing here, so I will just leave at, this is the definitive box set for any child of the 70's and early 80's.  I really hope they release these versions on Blu-ray one day as well.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Soul touching music.... the sista takes you on a calming thought provoking smooth ride....a must have.
B00382S9N2|5.0|My wife really wanted this and she is very happy. Amazon provided fast shipping and great packaging.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I maybe biased as I have been a long term Eninem fan, but this album was totally genius.
B0000046KM|5.0|I have been listening to this album, periodically, when the mood strikes, since 1997.  I get something new and ever more moving out of it each time.  The way Ms. Horn slows the cadence of a song feels as if she's slowing life.  This is, quite simply, my favorite album.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Claire Danes is superb as Temple Grandin, the animal husbandrist born 1947 in Boston and designer of humane cattle processing plants. This film, released in 2010 by HBO Films, traces Grandin's life from her early years in Boston through 1981, when she spoke at a national conference on autism, the disability she carries in her life. It shows the beginning of her career as a scientist and advocate for autism and humane treatment of farm animals she discusses in her many books on the subject [[ASIN:0547248237 Animals Make Us Human: Creating the Best Life for Animals]].<br /><br />The HBO made for broadcast film covers Grandin's youth, her years in boarding school and college, her pursuit of bachelor's and master's degrees at Arizona State University, and her early years in the cattle business where she strived to merge humane treatment for animals doomed to be food with solid science and business purposes. This is not a story about a bleeding heart animal lover; in contrast, it tells the story of a solid pragmatist, a scientist that works for better ways to manage animals raised for human food while paying the respect to the animals she believes they deserve. Grandin has gone on to revolutionize the way animals are treated in stockyards and in slaughterhouses, designing facilitiies that are more humane and at the same time more economically efficient.<br /><br />What is best in this film is the way it visualizes Grandin's brain at work. She sees the world in pictures, not in text or imagery. Even though I formerly worked for a state mental health agency that treated, among other things, autistic children, I was never sure exactly what the disability was. This film helped me understand its hold on people and how overstimulation in social situations is one of its more devastating consequences. You see this played out over and over again in the film, where Danes, as Grandin, is consistently at odds with a chaotic world in social situations but is completely in command of the world where she can visualize answers to significant intellectual questions.<br /><br />While I read her profile on Wikipedia, I don't know enough about Grandin to tell if the film is alwasy accurate in what it portrays. If it is, Grandin related more readily, in some respects, to other mammals than people. She learned early in life that the containment crate cattle go into (for branding or shots) calms them; she experimented with this on herself and found it had the same effect on her. This is only one of a couple dozen remarkable discoveries that await the viewer of this incredible film, which brought out my curiosity and interest more than any film I have seen in a very long while.<br /><br />With typically solid HBO production values and wonderful supporting performances from Julia Ormand (as Grandin's mother), David Strathairn (as her prep school science teacher that helped exploit her interest in science), and Catherine O'Hara as a loving relative, Temple Grandin is a knockout. To put it simply, this is one of the most enthralling, interesting, humane and entertaining movies I've seen in 2010 or any other year.<br /><br />HBO uses its resources well when it makes films and this time they have created a masterpiece, one surely deserving of the 7 Emmy award it won including best picture. I'm certain it will win at least half of those including Danes as best actress and whomever was in charge of wardrobe and makeup, as Danes looked remarkably like the real-life Temple Grandin throughout this movie.

0393072231|5.0|A MUST READ!! This book is absolutely amazing in the simplicity with which it explains what a credit-default swap is, what mortgage-bond is, what collaterized-debt obligation is and most importantly how and why those financial instruments became so prominent. I read the WSJ religiously and yet I really didn't understand anything in depth about these financial instruments until I read this book. It also does a great job of explaining why the whole financial ecosystem around subprime mortgages ultimately needed the Treasury to print money to cover all the insurance that AIG underwrote. Apart from describing the inner workings of AIG Financial Products, it also paints a very unflattering picture of present day Goldman Sachs as a money grabbing sleazy salesmen willing to sell and market the crappiest junk without remorse. Usually most people think of Goldman as these super smart stately diplomatic investment bankers and back-room dealers and this book just turns that image upside down  Also this book looks to be the blue-print after which the Frank-Dodd bill was designed and clearly explains why the cause of this whole situation is not Freddy Mac and Fannie Mae, but the relative incompetence of the rating agencies, the massive incompetence of Joe Cassano at AIG (who is first and foremost an executive manager, not a financier ), and the thorough exploitation of the current regulatory regime by big banks and big insurers. A MUST READ for anybody who wants to understand why 2008 happened.
B002ZG997C|5.0|It seems to me that the U.S., throughout the media, has had plenty of cynical, mocking, raucous-laugh-filled spins on the Judeo-Christian tradition. Hollywood seems to view religion as something that should either be ignored or mocked in films. Then along comes The Book of Eli, which dares to take a reverential view of religious faith.    The title character, forcefully portrayed by Denzel Washington, is a man on a mission. In a post-apocalyptic world in which many humans have become savages, many have become cannibals, Eli wants to save the sole remaining copy of a sacred text.    The film is full of startling images of a devastated planet. The trappings of civilization are scattered about in shambles. People struggle to survive in a world without law and order. Vicious gangs prey on the weak.    In the midst of it all, Eli is a moral man with a strict code of conduct. He has not descended into barbarism. And, possessing miraculous fighting skills, he will not let anything stand in his way.    Mila Kunis skillfully portrays a young woman who joins Eli's quest. Gary Oldman plays a devilish figure who wants to twist the words of the sacred text so that he can spread evil.    This film held my interest throughout. Non-stop action. Bold cinematography. Highly recommended.
8590379825|4.0|Something was in the air back in the 90s. Whatever it was, it spawned an entire generation of scripting languages, Lua among them. As with so many others, Lua has a modest type system, simple syntax, native support for tables with arbitrary indices, and many extensibility features. And, like many of the othe scripting languages, it has become the standard in at least one community of developers.<br /><br />Unlike other languages, Lua acknowledges that modern programming is often a multi-lingual affair. In fact, Lua is intended for use by C programs (and for using C code) as a language within a language. That lets developers use C's strengths in low-level programming and performance sensitive parts of applications, but switch to something a bit more friendly and flexible for other parts of the code - often, the majority of it. (There's something awry about the reasoning that says \\"I need C's capabilities for 2% of my app, so I'll write 100% of it in C.\\")<br /><br />Ierusalimschy's book provides a straightfoward but gently paced introduction to Lua. Power users will certainly need something stronger, but I found this a great way to see what the language is about and why it stirs such loyalty among its devotees.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000MQC9H4|3.0|This is pretty simple...I thought the movie was O.K. ...but my wife really liked it...so I bought it...not much more to be said...a real chick flick...
B002N83GYE|5.0|I just finished reading this using the Kindle Software on my iPad. I was once a Mac user and went to PC in the early 90's. I serviced, trained and worked on PC for more than decade before finally switching back to Apple. It all started with my switch from Zune to iPod Touch.    Reading this book explains exactly what happened to me along the way. The design, the closed platform and trouble free operation of Apple products as well as the packaging and marketing are all very carefully planned at Apple. Apple is an American icon and truly a unique innovation company.     This is a great book about the company that Steve built and why it will be around and ahead of the competition long after Jobs leaves the company.
B00005U122|5.0|Everything that needs to be said about this amazing/wonderful concert has been said already so there is no need for me to repeat it. But I was curious what the one star reviewers thought because I couldnt imagine what they didnt like. What is interesting is that they all say they couldnt watch the concert (because they didnt like it) but they review it anyways. What are they basing their review on, 2 min of the concert that they didnt like? Anyways, I highly recommend this to all lovers of great music.
B00275EGWY|5.0|National Review gave a good rating...so do I. It's nice to see a movie that supports our troops while telling a story about heroes in a positive light. I not going to tell you anything about it because I got it blind sided and think it would stand on its own merit.
B001OQCV6A|2.0|Enjoyable movie, but my comments pertain to the Blu-ray disc. For some reason the studio decided to release this with English surround sound encoded in DTS only. French (and Spanish?) are encoded as Dolby 5.1, but not English. Those of us who prefer the Queen's tongue but are otherwise without DTS systems are plain out of luck. Sans DTS, we are left with Dolby Pro Logic, which is just not comparable, and on my otherwise well balanced system, sounds way too bass heavy for some reason.    A real drag, though the film looks fine otherwise.
031606792X|5.0|My grandaughter loved this book.  She read it in two days and has started it again.  The book was in excellent condition and I will buy from this seller again.
B000WZAE1I|3.0|I saw this movie when it first came out, but right after I had read the book.  At first, I was disappointed because the movie wasn't true to the book.  For some reason I wanted to see it again and could not find it anywhere, not even in the library, so I ordered it.  After distancing myself from the original book I found this movie enchanting.  Good performance from Michelle Pfieffer.
1595825045|5.0|I actually bought this book at Comic-con a few days ago, I happened to run into a guy in line for one of the panels that had bought it, he was nice enough to let me have a quick look through and it peak my interest.So after I gave up on the huge line, I went to buy it.    I'm glad I did...      Now I'm not a huge fan of the show but it has been one of my favorites in the past years. And this book gives you a bit more of a look into it's creation.    The biggest thing that hit me, was that it was a mostly visual book w/ very little actually reading (other than captions of course) but the main text that is in there is commentary notes from both of the creators...and I really thing THAT is what actually makes this book great.     It really makes you appreciate all the little ideas and last second changes the creators made over the course of 3 seasons that actually made the series as great as it is. I am really glad I got this book, and I'm sure any other fan of Avatar will feel the same.
B003X9W98G|5.0|Now I have bought all episodes of this show and watched via my [[ASIN:B002U6EWPG Roku SD Player]] and I must say I am really impressed with how BBC did this.  I have liked Doctor Who in the beginning but now I just simply love how they did the story arc.<br /><br />River Song \\"Spoilers!\\"<br /><br />Not to spoil it for anyone I would like to highlight some of the more interesting parts of the story arc!<br /><br />&lt;*>River Song(Alex Kingston who played in [[ASIN:B000B7QCGI ER: The Complete Fourth Season]]) has been nothing but a joy to see again.  She has always been a good actor and I love how she is so passionate about her roles.  I can't say enough about this actor but I will say any movie or show she plays in is a pleasure to see.  She brings more momentum and action into anything she does.  That being said this story arch with her in it seems to fit her characteristics and I honestly think she wanted this role to begin with.  We haven't seen the last of this character and I will be subscribing to Season 6 without a doubt because I know she will be playing a bigger role in that season and possibly Season 7!!<br /><br />&lt;*>Matt Smith([[ASIN:B003EV6DBM Doctor Who: The Complete Fifth Series]]) has nailed the Doctor who character from the start.  If you think he wasn't a fit, I would have to disagree.  I think he watch some of the older shows and understood the real Doctor to the point that he doesn't pull it of but he makes you think he's the doctor for the old series.  The Other characters from 2005 have been somewhat remissness to the character of Doctor who, but I don't get that with him!!<br /><br />&lt;*>Karen Gillan([[ASIN:B003EV6DBM Doctor Who: The Complete Fifth Series]]) has been nothing but a great mystery until this finale episode we start to get to understand her and relish her plot throughout the season.

B001HN694K|2.0|When I heard that Johnny Depp was going to play the Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's rendition of Alice in Wonderland, I was really excited and couldn't wait.  After seeing the movie, I feel like it was a waste of time that no amount of cool computer effects could rectify.    Yes, the movie has good effects but that's about all it has going for it.  Even Johnny Depp disappoints.  His character is too tame (despite the ridiculous make-up), too bland, and frankly, a major let-down.  My biggest problems with the movie were:    1. Completely predictable plot.  I mean, come on.  They told us what was going to happen from the beginning.  Is that any way to make for an interesting story?  There was no point in watching because you already knew what was going to happen.  And the whole, grown-up Alice coming back to wonderland was stupid because we're supposed to believe that she somehow forgot about it or something.  Really?  Just stupid.    2. First-class actors really fudging their parts.  First there is the Johnny Depp thing.  As if that wasn't bad enough, Ann Hathaway, who is normally a classy actress, plays possibly the most annoying characters ever - the White Queen.  She prances around holding her hands in that stupid princess way and talks in a voice so annoying you really wish someone would just shut her up already.  Helena Boham Carter is the one exception to the poor acting and comes through wonderfully as the Red Queen in typical Helena Boham Carter fashion.  But I'm not sure what the point was of half-animating her.  The girl who plays Alice is bland and unmemorable.    3. The only spontenaity or uniqueness in the film is the special effects (which are well-done).  It feels like Tim Burton put no effect into this movie at all.  You're used to his films being wacky, crazy, and incredibly messed up.  Then, given an already wacky story, for some reason, he decides to make is more tame.  Yes, I realize Alice in Wonderland is sort of a kid's story.  But at the same time,it's an intense, crazy, twisted kid's story.  This version seems to lose the whimsical nature of the story.
B001EN71DG|2.0|Why why why? George had to mess with perfection. The originals were not as eye popping as todays' CGI films but quite well done special effects for that time. It felt more \\"real\\" than the overdone movies of today....don't get me wrong, I love a lot of today's great effects films but some do go overboard to the point where you feel like you are watching an almost animated film. For example, the Hulk movies where he is CGI look so unrealistic it ruins the action scenes completely. I don't feel the character is struggling or doing anything at all.<br /><br />I admire the actor who played the Thing in Fantastic Four for insisting on a suit rather than CGI, much more believable that he lost his human form to a mutation rather than an elaborate cartoon taking over his part.<br /><br />Well, I guess it seems hypocritical to worry about the realism of such movies that are so far from reality but that's what movies are supposed to do, make you believe in the unbelievable, even if for just two hours of your life. And that's the magic.<br /><br />So George, give the true fans a gift and put the originals on Blu ray! You might not make a \\"huge\\" profit but you will be saying thanks for the memories to the old fans in a very big way.

B003NFM3JU|5.0|I am a great fan of 3D. I am a great fan of Christmas movies. I am a great fan of 'A Christmas Carol'. I was skeptical going into this one; however it is a very faithful rendition of the story. The 3D is excellent. I found some details in this film that I have never seen in any adaptation of the story; the story is adapted well. There are two negatives in the movie. 1)Occasionally the 3D was used solely for 'awe' factor. I can get over this one because the 'awe' factor was pretty amazing. 2)There is a scene during the Ghost of Christmas Future segment (the one where Scrooge in miniaturized) that I thought was simply added because the producers thought they needed some action before the conclusion. Although I overlooked this problem because the rest of the movie was so good, I was disappointed at the scene (you can see part of it in the trailer.) I can't wait to see it again in 3D and will buy the movie on 3D Blu-ray this year.

0061537969|5.0|As a person who's had dogs over the years, I found this work to be particularly enjoyable because the author chose the dog, Enzo, to be the narrator of the work. This very creative writing approach made the work captivating to me since I've always felt that dogs (and other animals) are far more sentient than they are customarily thought to be. By using Enzo in this role, Garth Stein was able to bring a very novel perspective to the narration, and in many instances I wound up smiling because something he said made me wonder what my own dogs might have said if they could just speak our language. Though I'll admit that the extensive details about auto racing didn't really interest me, I thought the overall story was excellent and as such highly recommend this book, especially for anyone who has had pets and shared stories about their \\"humanness.\\"<br /><br />As an aside, prior to writing this review I took the time to read an assortment of other reviews to get a feel for what others thought of the book. As an author myself it always amazes me how some readers can be so totally jazzed about a book, while others (e.g., some of those placing 1 star reviews) can be downright mean-spirited in their evaluation of the work. It just goes to show that the old adage that \\"you can't please all the people all the time\\" is just as relevant as it ever was. This also demonstrates why it's important for any prospective reader to first review a sampling of both glowing and negative reviews prior to purchasing. If you wind up resonating more with the disapproving ones then why annoy yourself by buying the book in the first place?
0312997221|5.0|Usually, I am not interested in vengeance stories, but this one is so intricate and credible that you eat it up to the end. The political background is impeccable. I am always impressed by Forsyth's understanding of politics.

B003L20ICE|4.0|Lisa Cholodenko's new film tackles topics whose time has come. While the nation continues to roil with debate about gay marriage, countless same-sex couples have quietly entered into partnerships as durable as any heterosexual pairing, and many of these have produced children, either through adoption, or as in the case of Nic and Jules, the couple played by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in \\"The Kids Are All Right,\\" artificial insemination, each having a baby by the same sperm donor (how common is this, I wonder?). Touching on another modern familial trend, their teenaged children Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) have decided to seek out their biological father (Mark Ruffalo), who turns out to be Paul, an organic farmer and restaurateur whose casual attitude toward relationships is in sharp contrast to the committed family unit he has unknowingly aided in producing.<br /><br />Whatever his flaws, Paul nevertheless has something that has been lacking in their lives, and the children and Jules, the less driven of the two women, soon warm to him. The perfectionist, overachieving Nic hangs back warily, threatened by what she sees as the unthinking eagerness of her loved ones to steer into deep emotional waters. It is one of the outstanding virtues of Cholodenko's film that the twists and turns these five people's lives take after their initial contact seem, with one important exception, entirely natural and inevitable. Much credit has to go to the script by Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg, so adept at catching the nuances of family life and friendship, particularly the way the strains of everyday existence and the routine of years together can chip away at genuine love to the point of collapse before anyone knows what has happened. This truth is beautifully limned in a moving climactic speech by Moore.<br /><br />She is one of an altogether superb cast--Annette Bening's return to the screen is welcome and she plays Nic to absolute perfection (her silences are almost more eloquent than her words), while Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson are hardly less good as the children; Wasikowska in particular has a luminosity of a young Gwyneth Paltrow. That leaves Ruffalo, and though he has played the scruffy hunk role before, he does it very well, especially late in the film when he's conveying the bewilderment of a man who realizes, much too late, how far he is out of his depth.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />So what's not to like? I suppose when it came to constructing the major plot crisis, it had to be the one Cholodenko and Blumberg chose. Only something that traumatic could have blown everyone's fragile happiness to smithereens, not to be put back together again except with agonizing care and no guarantee of success. Still, it's the one event that strikes a contrived note, and all the more disappointing because it plays into all of the sniggering stereotypes about a woman just needing the right man to show her the ropes. It seems churlish to complain  when so much is right about \\"The Kids Are All Right,\\" --but this flaw thereby seems the more glaring in comparison. Still, no one should be dissuaded from seeing this otherwise superb movie--there's too much great writing and acting in it, and food for thought long after it's over.re almost more eloquent than her words), while Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson are hardly less good as the children; Wasikowska in particular has a luminosity of a young Gwyneth Paltrow.

B0034JKZ86|2.0|Why did a movie about a black princess have to be emeshed in a social and polictical framework? This movie attempted to capture black culture and failed miserably. This movie is not represenative of the black experience for most.  Only people with roots in the creole culture might relate to this movie but that is only a fraction of the African American experience.   What happened to the fantasy framework of all the other Disney princess movies?  Film makers persist in portraying African Americans steeped in the stereotypes of the antebellum south. The very over played setting of The black servant's child playing with the rich white plantation owners daughter needs to be put to rest. The south, the massa/servant relationship, the dixieland music, the gumbo, the dialect, the voodoo, the caricatures, the prince, of course, couldn't be a black male to save the black princess and other stereotypes galore made for an incredibly disappointing cinema experience and disappointed with Disney --again. Blacks have progressed eons beyond the black slave/servant image ..just look around in the real world and step outside of racist stereotypics perceptions of black people in the USA . Stop tying and portraying African Americans to slavery and as servants, gangsters and criminals.

B00338QENI|4.0|I have mixed feelings about the story the book tells of Henrietta Lacks whose life was cruelly cut short by the strangely aggressive cancer, which itself led to incredible scientific breakthroughs that have saved millions, if not billions, of people all over the world. The book, which is meticulously researched, explains the scientific mystery surrounding Henrietta's \\"immortal\\" cells, the only cells thus discovered which have survived and multiplied seemingly indefinitely, contrary to any other cells that scientists have tried to culture. For this alone, Henrietta could be regarded as a modern day saint whose life of poverty, deprivation and suffering, have spared us disease, disability and even early death.    The book also delves into the ethics behind cell research and the degree to which any of us have a legal right to control if, how, and when, parts of our bodies, even cells, can be used (and misused) by science. Furthermore, the author has succeeded in eloquently addressing America's shameful dark past of racial segregation and how African Americans were used, as the Nazi's used the Jews, for conducting \\"scientific\\" experiments.    The most disturbing aspect the book raises by far, in my view, is the degrading third-world conditions in which a large swathe of the population of this \\"so-called\\" advanced and most powerful nation on Earth, live today: in poverty, without access to either health care nor education, nor even decent housing or safety. All these are violations of Human Rights, which stipulate the right of each individual to safety, health care, education, and equality.     That Henrietta Lack's offspring are still unable to receive basic medical care, irrespective of the contribution their mother inadvertently made to the advance of medicine, and were unable to even comprehend the basic science behind her immortal HeLa cells, is indicative of their limited (even non-existant) education.     This is a sad commentary of the double standards that existin our society, which is paradoxically the most affluent in the world. I sincerely hope that this book helps raise awareness of the conditions in which millions of Americans continue to live today, and the urgent need to address the disparities in our society, and provide decent health care, education, and human dignity to all Americans.

B0000252YK|5.0|Guitarist Jake E. Lee, the most underrated and best musician Ozzy has ever worked with. This guy may not have been Randy on guitar but he writes songs and helped Ozzy have great success after Randy's tragic Death. Jake is more of a total musician than any of Ozzy's other players, not just a guitar player as you can see with Badlands in witch he wrote the music for. Jake wrote this album while Ozzy was in rehab, Ozzy fans know that he always got by with a little help from his pals.   Although the reason Jake left the band or wanted to was because of the comparisons and close relationship Ozzy had with Randy Rhoads. Jake considered his work with Ozzy as a job I think. He and Bob Daisey were great writers for Ozzy. That's why the songs are better on Ozzy's early albums. Zach Wylde, may have been a great player for Ozzy I'm not sure if he contributed in those writing songs area's. He also wanted to do his own thing as did Jake at the time after this album. Anyway enough truth, this is a great, fun album, with killer tunes!

0312117337|5.0|This is the best deck for divination that I have found. I was using the Rider/Waite deck and I also have the Goddess deck by Doreen Virtue.  This Zen deck perhaps because it was inspired and designed with the help of a spiritual teacher is just right on target.  By that I mean the text is quite clear and the meanings are not fuzzy or interpretive. It tells you this is what's happening! A lot of the meanings relate to spiritual development, even the ones that relate to minor arcana are extremely helpful and honest, they often give a psychological explanation as well.  The text is all done in Osho's trademark, funny but brutally honest style and are excerpts from his talks/books. And I've found it to be amazingly on target. The artist was also supposed to be a student of tarot and a spiritual student.  I've been recommending it to friends since experiencing the clarity of this deck for readings.  Highly recommended.
B001R0XNSI|1.0|The Cold Steel Shark is the new all-black version of the older Sharkie model, which had a black cap and a white body, a look-alike of a Sharpie marker, changed for trademark-infringement reasons.  The large body, 22 mm at its widest point, belies the size of the Shark's fine tip, which at 2 mm is much smaller than a normal Sharpie's 4 mm tip.  The combination makes for an awkward writing instrument, much beefier in the hand than a Dr. Grip pen, and, if one needs to do fine writing work or even a careful signature, it's downright uncomfortable.  In addition to the odd feel, the Shark requires four-and-a-half turns of the cap before removal, which might not sound like a lot until one tries to actually employ the pen for writing purposes: turn, turn, turn, turn, and turn some more; I hope you didn't need to jot down a quick note.  The cap's clip, made of the same material as the rest of the Shark, fiber-reinforced nylon (FRN), is stiff and possesses very, very little elasticity, which means that, while it will clip solidly to a pocket (better for a pants' pocket than a shirt, due to the 1.6 ounce heft), it will snap off if pulled too hard.    While the Shark is a failure as a pen, it does make for a nice impact weapon, with a sturdy body of FRN.  As long as it is firmly seated in the base of the palm, it can give a mighty poke, but, as there is no hilt, just a smooth cylinder, the striker must be mindful not to let the Shark slip loose from the grip in a thrusting strike.  The Shark can be used in the fashion of a kubotan, although it does not have the finger grooves of the better kubotan designs.  In turn, because the Shark is touted as a self-defense item, in some jurisdictions, it is illegal to carry it.  Sure, the bearer could plead ignorance of the Shark as a weapon, but, since it is not readily available in stationary and office-supply stores, it seems unlikely that defense would be accepted, and, if the possessor of the Shark is on probation or parole, it'll beeasy for a law enforcement officer to make a case for a felony charge.  While it's not an analogue of the lipstick knife, it is a cousin in that it is a \\"disguised\\" weapon.      I really don't see what the Shark will do better than a Sharpie or Marks-A-Lot marker, but it certainly costs a lot more and looks cool in the pencil holder.

Though the story is intriguing and captivating, the numerous errors in the kindle edition makes it an abysmal failure to me.

It was worth watching each episode! The acting was fantastic, the characters enthralling, need I go on? I don't own ANY seasons of any show on television, but this is the first one I will considering buying. I know I could watch these a few times over and not get sick of it. So again, I ask, why the heck was it canceled???
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I use this for a 22\\" LCD, and I would not use it for anything larger than a 24\\" screen. The weight of the monitor requires you to tighten the hinges (or the monitor will fall) fairly tightly and then you will have to force the monitor (or loosen the hinges) to get it to move which will cause you to cringe as you hear the monitor shell bend.    The cable clips are worthless. Just throw them out and use zip ties. They are two parts that don't stay together, are too small to fit a high quality VGA, (or HDMI or DVI) cable and power cord, and even if they did are not strong enough to hold them in place (as they are slotted at bottom).     The arm offers desk-side and though hole mounts. Both are very easy to use and effective.The Top of the mount is rubber, so it won't mar your desktop.      The vesa plates fit well and are good quality (I've seen some cheap arms that need some drill work for the vesa plates to fit). There is also not too much extra metal, so they will fit in older style recessed dell monitors (again a problem with some other vesa plates) vesa mounts.      I think it is perfectly fine for people who don't adjust a monitor often. For single users who may adjust it once a day, This should be fine. I would put some loc-tite on the hinge screws. (as they will back out with normal use). If you do that you will be all set.     For public computer stations where multiple users may be moving the monitor on a daily basis, I would invest in a higher quality, and more intuitive to use arm(I say that because the hinges get at weird angles and then it rotates strangely, as well as the fact that you have to press the center hinge to get it to release). It really is a 3 star product for a good price.  For the price, its hard to beat and it offers some good adjustment options for infrequent adjusters. If you plan to adjust it a lot definitely tweak the screw tension and set it with loctite. (when you get a setting you like, mark the position with a marker... apply the thread-locker, and tension until the marks line up again)

B001IWELF4|5.0|This was the best film made in '97 but like \\"Chinatown,\\" another noir, it is destined to become one of the finest movies not to take the Oscar home. Curtis Hanson took James Ellroy's novel, a book many doubted could be translated to the film medium, and crafted one of the finest adapted screenplays ever written. He then brought on board a couple of Aussie unknowns, a gorgeous star who had never lived up to her potential, and one of the finest actors working in film today. He then began filming one of the darkest noir films of all time in the blinding L.A. sun.<br /><br />The end result is a dark and twisted tale of personal redemption told against the backdrop of the bright lights and sunshine of Hollywood in the early 1950's. Hanson contrasted the brightly lit exteriors with Ellroy's dark storyline of police corruption and Hollywood decadence. This is a movie about facade, not just Hollywood's but our own personal front as well.<br /><br />Russell Crowe became a star as Detective Bud White, a tough cop willing to do whatever was necessary, which was in stark contrast to his politically minded colleague Guy Pearce. He finds Bud archaic, representing everything about the force he wants to change. What may stop him from doing so is his investigation into the murder of several people at The Night Owl cafe, one of whom is Crowe's partner, kicked off the force after a well publicized jail brawl christened given the handle \\"Bloody Christmas\\" by the papers.<br /><br />Crowe and Pearce come at it from different angles but the road for both leads right to beautiful Kim Basinger and a millionaire in the lush Hollywood hills played by David Strathairn. There is a reason Basinger looks a little like Veronica Lake the first time we see her in this film; she's supposed to. Hollywood legend has it that a string of expensive call girls were cut to look like stars during the 1940's and early 1950's and Hanson has made this darker side of Hollywood part of the story. Basinger is one of the lucky ones; close enough to the actual look of Veronica Lake not to have been cut on.<br /><br />Crowe falls for the real girl inside Basinger, but in spite of her opulent lifestyle, her low self-esteem comes to the forefront when she sleeps with Pearce in an attempt to \\"help\\" Crowe. We realize as she nearly destroys Crowe by doing so that she perceives herself as a whore on the inside, beneath the facade. Her logic is as twisted and tainted as the corruption Crowe and Pierce are about to uncover as they follow the trail linking Basinger's boss Strathairn to the Night Owl killings and the vice surrounding them on every side.<br /><br />Basinger may have garnered the Oscar for her role, but Crowe's performance as the tough cop with some soft spots after all is something you'll always remember. The coolest job done here, however, is by Kevin Spacey. Hanson told him before filming began to think Dean Martin and he'd have it down pat. Spacey did just that, playing the ultra cool cop, the one in the tabloids for his Hollywood connections. He is a consultant on the TV show \\"Badge of Honor\\" (think Dragnet) and is hooked up with slimy but likeable Danny DeVito, a writer for a Hollywood tabloid. Spacey grabs the spotlight and DeVito gets the headlines as Spacy collars Hollywood stars in compromising situations, DeVito's camera flashing.<br /><br />Spacey seemingly has it all, but like the rest of this film, it is just a facade. While sitting in a bar listening to Dean Martin in the background he looks up into the mirror behind the counter and doesn't like what is staring back at him. He has all the tools to be a great cop but he knows he has sold his soul for the fifty in front of him. He becomes involved in the case because of a murder in a hotel room he feels responsible for that leads right back to the Night Owl, and hooks up with Pearce to redeem his soul. You will never forget the name \\"Rollo Tomasi\\" or what it means for Pearce, and ultimately Spacey in this film.<br /><br />Adding to the atmosphere more than just a little is the score by Jerry Goldsmith, his finest work since \\"Chinatown\\" and just as haunting. It does more than help enhance the atmosphere, it truly is the atmosphere of this one of a kind masterpiece. This film has the kind of ending dreams are made of and someone holding up their badge to the oncoming rush of cop cars in the Hollywood hills at night is a scene you'll never forget.<br /><br />There is not a bad performance in this film. It is complex and riveting. This is a region two edition for those who need that venue. If you haven't seen this before, don't rent it, buy it. You'll watch it over and over. But don't tell anyone. This is Off the Record, On the QT, and Very Hush Hush!ust a little is the score by Jerry Goldsmith, his finest work since \\"Chinatown\\" and just as haunting.

0143118420|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert writes so well that she could write about almost anything and make it humorous and readable. The title pretty much describes her topic: In Italy, she eats; in India, she prays; in Bali, she loves. If you're looking for a deeply spiritual, revelatory book, this one is not for you. If you want a cooking travelogue, this is also not for you. But if you're looking for a lively, richly descriptive story of one woman's journey through despair to enjoying life again with open-hearted abandon, then read this book. I laughed out loud repeatedly at her humorous descriptions of people and places, as well as her own emotional and spiritual ups and downs. Yet, there were times when I was also emotionally moved by her story. I wouldn't necessarily call it a spiritual book, though I appreciated her describing that part of her life. It's not entirely a romance either, though that certainly will draw people to the book and film. It's just a really really good read--I loved it!  Peggy Kornegger  author of Living with Spirit, Journey of a Flower Child
B0007MWZEK|3.0|It's a super little sweeper.  It does just as advertised.  But don't expect it to be anything like a vacuum.  It has no suction.  It only sweeps the particles on the floor into the collection bin, but only particles that can be picked up by spinning brushes.  Dust and powder stay on the floor.  But as I said, as a sweeper it's good.  I especially like that it can get into those hard-to-reach areas.

B00008G9JO|5.0|This is one of Tull's best albums, if not the best. More approachable than Thick as a Brick (which is *not* a criticism of Thick as a Brick), yet still very much thinking man's rock. It rocks hard, yet paints a beautiful picture of the English countryside. For those of us who have an appreciation for farming or feel a kinship with nature, it stirs strong passions. From a musical standpoint, it is amazing. /No Lullaby/ by itself would be reason to buy the album.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|Normally I run (screaming) from chick flicks (not to mention romcoms), but when a film appears featuring the charismatic talent (not to mention physically stunning) of Kate Winslet, it also commands my undivided attention.  So I sat through THE HOLIDAY and grimaced and twitched; when it was over I wanted to have a good cry and bake a cake and call my grandmother.  Actually I wanted to do none of the above, but I did feel some considerable estrogen exposure.<br /><br />THE HOLIDAY features two professional women unlucky in love who swap homes for Christmas to forget their troubles.  Thus Winslet travels to posh LA, while her counterpart (Cameron Diaz) arrives at Winslet's picturesque cottage in England.  And--of course--both ladies encounter romantic interests in the form of Winslet's brother (Jude Law), who captivates Diaz, and the smirking Jack Black, who wows Winslet (note the succession of \\"w\\"s).  It's all contrived, predictable, and marginally humorous (but please:  Jack Black as a romantic interest is a howler), with a closing scene in London on New Year's Eve so syrupy and gooey I had to go out on the driveway and gargle gravel just to get the bubblegum taste out of my mouth.  Winslet demonstrates some chops, while Diaz and Law seem to phone their performances in, with the near-centenarian Eli Wallach appearing in a most gracious role.  All in all THE HOLIDAY nominally entertains, as long as the viewer doesn't feel compelled to watch in high heels.<br />D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
0307454541|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is one of the most intriguing heroines in modern literature. Stieg Larsson set the bar high with his introduction to the Millennium series. Would recommend to anyone interested in adult suspense.
B0038ZITHK|3.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. We are big fans of Al Pacino. This had a good story. My only complaint is the Blue-ray quality was no better than a standard DVD; thus the 3 rating. If one is going to pay a premium for BD then the quality needs to be there.
1878424505|5.0|I read this book in a few hours and it changed several life-long paradigms in the way I viewed life.  The best way I can say it is that I've bought this book many times now for my family and friends.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I never watched this season while it was on TV. Friends recommended it to me, but my feelings were, \\"Meh\\". While I enjoyed T1 and T2, Terminator 3 left me traumatized. I finally broke down and rented the first DVD of Season 1.    The acting was intense and it immersed me into their world.     Character development: Some things are rightfully never explained, but inferred. Summer Glau's performance as Cameron (a Terminator) is a prime example, Cameron seems capable of putting on emotions like a person would put on clothing, sometimes they are dressed to the nines, other times not so much. Yet as a viewer I'm not watching Summer Glau. Not really. I'm watching Cameron, I'm watching her behave and try out emotional responses. Her transitions are subtle and often eerie... a machine trying to appear human at times and trying to become human at others. There are differences between her and the other Terminators such as she can make her eyes glow blue (obvious difference) and that her visual display is often fully color instead of the other terminators using infrared. Her motives though stated become giant questions in my mind, after watching her as a Terminator skillfully lie to those she claims to serve and protect.    The pacing of character development appears to be a rule adhered throughout the series, no matter which writer wrote an episode or which director directed. Wonderfully crafted.    I could write pages about all of the characters and the thought that went behind them. The actors did an amazing job (Lena Headey shows a great mix of being incredibly strong and emotionally vulnerable, you'll believe that she's on the brink of despair and giving up, but it's only her willpower and strength that keeps things going).    The individual episodes are for the most part extremely well written and directed. The choreography of the fight scenes are pretty good for a TV series (and re-affirms the Terminators bash each other into things motif from T2) and are completely believable.    All in all.. this is surprisingly awesome.    I bought both Seasons on DVD and have purchased about 6 copies of Season 1 which I've given away to some of my other friends so that they can watch it too.
1933308087|5.0|This is a glorious book.    The instructions given for pattern design are  very clear and conscise.    The selection of patterns and variety of fabrics used  gives unlimited pleasure and this is certainly going to  be one of my perennial favourites.
0060853972|5.0|Aziraphale and Crowley, an angel and a demon, have known each other since the Garden of Eden.  They are acquaintances, very nearly friends, who get together to discuss their successes, talk about humanity, and have a few drinks.  Over time, both have become rather attached to the world and the people who populate it.    Although the angel and demon have known from the start that it was coming, it is still distressing when they find out that the Antichrist has been born and they only have eleven years until the end of the world.  Aziraphale and Crowley both know that Hell on Earth would be unpleasant, but Heaven on Earth wouldn't be much better.  They need to stop the Apocalypse.      For eleven years the angel and the demon shadow the Antichrist, subtly trying to affect his personality, waiting for a sign of his power to show itself.  All the while not realizing that someone bungled the infant switch.  The Antichrist is growing up, blissfully unaware of who he is and completely unbothered by otherworldly beings, in a small town in England.    Forces are centering on Tadfield.  Prophesies are interpreted, the four horsemen of the Apocalypse are finding motorcycles more to their liking than horses, and a hellhound feels rather more doglike than he'd expected at the side of his new master.  A boy named Adam begins to think about the problems of the world and how great it would be if he could just get rid of this world and start everything all over.  And chaos begins to descend.    This book was really funny, much more so than I'd expected.  I especially loved the interaction between Crowley and Aziraphale and the things each of them loved about the world.  The four horsemen were nicely updated, and the Antichrist himself was a great character with an equally amusing backstory.  Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|if youre like me you thought the only decent eminem albums were marshal mathers and slim shady. this album blows everything else away. almost every song is a classic. even if youre not an eminem fan you will like this album, guaranteed.

B000GGSMB2|2.0|wow,what a disappointment.i had high hopes for this movie.i had heard it was great.and it was directed by Brian De Palma with a screenplay by Oliver Stone.not to mention it's rated #161 of the top 250 on IMDb so far,so good,right?wrong.for me,this is a decent movie but nothing more.it never really engaged me.i wasn't bored necessarily,but i wasn't overly interested either.the acting did very little for me,except for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio,who i thought was exceptional as Gina Montana.there were some good actors here,but i feel they were wasted. Al Pacino wasn't really impressive.also,this was supposed to be controversial movie,but i have seen a lot worse in terms of both violence and language.anyway,i would certainly not place this movie in my top 250 movies of all time.it doesn't have the impact of the original 1932 version.for me,Scarface is a 2.5/5
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|I don´t care if it was the director intention, but then grain in this movie is awful, the movie looks like it´s dirty, there is so much freaking grain I had to stop watching the movie because it was too distracting for me.When I think of blu ray, I think of a crystal clear image, not a dirty one, and I know every movie has its own art, but when this art its so annoying that a lot of people don´t like it, there is something wrong with this art, and is not that I hate grain, I like it in movies that have it in a subtle amount, but not like in this movie that is way too exaggerated. As far as the movie, the story is great, the style and the colors are great, the effects are great, the only thing I don´t like is the exaggerated grain.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|i won't go into too much detail about this film,because i think any potential viewer should go into into it with no preconceived notions.but,i can say it is one very powerful movie with terrific acting and directing.on he acting front you have the great Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela.and directing the proceedings is master of the craft Clint Eastwood.you can't ask for a better combination than that.Matt Damon also stars,and is very good,but it's Freeman's show.obviously there a political angle to the story.but there's more than that.there's a liberal does of Rugby as well.it's basically a drama/sports/biography(with some dramatic license)and political film.it all adds up to one engrossing,compelling experience.for me,Invictus is a 4/5
1400095913|5.0|I became addicted to the Dexter series on Showtime before I ever knew about these novels, but I am certainly glad I learned about the books so I could go back to square one. I was worried that I would already know the story too well and wouldn't enjoy reading this novel, but was I ever wrong. Even while making constant comparisons to the characters and plot of the tv show, I found Lindsay's book captivating and extremely well written. Even if gruesome murder mystery isn't typically your style, Dexter is really as likable as the review snip-its on the front of the book say. I am ordering the rest of the novels right now and already can't wait to see what happens next.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|i had high hopes for this this political thriller directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Mattt Damon.i wasn't disappointed.there were some very tense and exciting moments and the film does get high marks for authenticity and realism.the hand held camera and the so called shakiness than people complain about doesn't bother me at all.that just adds to the realism as does the graininess in certain scenes.the chaos of war is also captured very well here too.as for the acting,Matt Damon was convincing,but not a standout Brendan Gleeson and Greg Kinear were both very good,but for me,Jason Isaacs and the under-appreciated Amy Ryan were brilliant.Ryan really impressed with her character,even though it wasn't a huge role.for me,Green Zone is a 4/5
B003RUZKC8|3.0|I was totally looking forward to seeing this film but it was too much like A-team! Very predictable :(
B003PGNBO8|5.0|This was one of the best shows I have ever seen...  It was thrilling, on the edge of your seat drama in every episode.  You got emotionally attached to each character and were wanting MORE after the end of every episode.  BUY this set...  You absolutely won't regret it...

0545123275|5.0|I actually read this book for the first time last Fall, but I thought that with the sequel Linger coming out in a few months that it would be a good time to post a review (plus I am currently rereading it for the third time). Shiver is amazing! This was the first book that I had read by Maggie Stiefvater and I instantly became a fan. The transitions in narrator point of view gave an interesting flow to the story. Grace has been longing for her yellow eyed wolf since she was eleven and had been attacked by his pack. Grace does not have much memory of the attack by the wolf pack or how she was saved but ever since she saw the yellow eyed wolf she has felt drawn to him.     Sam waits for Grace every year, watching her from the woods that he and his pack call home for the cold winters. Sam is only able to be human in the warm summer months, but even that is slipping away. This will be his last transition from wolf to human and then he will lose Grace forever unless they can find away to stop it.    Grace and Sam have loved each other for years and despite the odds that are put against them they are determined to find a way to make it work. This book is full of passion, humor, sadness, and keeps you turning the page into the early morning hours.    [...]
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this Hollywood classic.  Hoffman is pure perfection in this light-hearted flick!
0545123283|5.0|If you have not read Shiver....first of all, shame on you (lol) and second of all, this might spoil that book for you. I promise not to give spoilers for Linger here because Maggie might come after me. We all know how she feels about reading the last page first so giving you spoilers might provoke her lol.<br /><br />At the end of Shiver we were left with the warm and fuzzies. Sam is human again! Yay! Grace and Sam can be together and take care of the wolves and just keep looking for a way to cure the others in between all of their happy times. But this is a series so Maggie Stiefvater decided to crush our dreams by disrupting Sam and Grace's perfect little future...it is so worth it though!<br /><br />I was able to get my hands on a copy of Linger early this week and I just finished last night and holy crap it was good! Linger made by laugh, cry and even yell at the book at one point. No joke I was sitting next to my roommate on the couch and I suddenly screamed \\"NOOOOO!\\" That damn Tom Culpeper! My roommate defiantly thinks I have lost my mind but oh well.<br /><br />As for Linger, the story picks up pretty much were we left off in Shiver. Sam is human and it is late winter/early spring in Mercy Falls. The new wolves will be falling out of their coats and into their human skins soon. The new wolves may be shifting already due to their unstable nature. This is where Cole comes in. Shiver was told from Sam and Grace's point of views but Linger adds Isabel and Cole to the mix. I love getting into Cole's head. He is all dark and twisty and oh did I mention Hot yet? I love Sam but Cole is giving him a run for his money. I mean he is simply swoon worthy. I think that a big part of Linger is focused on everyone trying to figure out where they fit. Grace feels not quite right in her skin, Sam is having trouble accepting that he actually has a future now, Isabel is raked with guilt over Jack's death, and Cole is trying to escape his past by losing his humanity to the wolf inside him.<br /><br />A testament to Maggie's awesomeness: Linger starts to dive into what causes the change from human to wolf and vice versa. There may be more to it then temperature. While I was reading the book and Cole was musing about this issue I found myself nodding and thinking \\"Good point Cole, why did I never think of that?\\" I feel like I want to research how to cure the wolves. Like I can find the answer to the fictional enigma that Maggie has presented. I know I am crazy but it is that good and I feel so invested in the story now. Keep in mind that this is a three book series so the ending will literally make you scream in agony, \\"Why, oh why must I wait a whole year for Forever to come out!?\\" I thought waiting for Linger was bad but waiting for Forever is going to be almost unbearable! As I mentioned in my previous post Linger will be released officially on the 13th so you must pick it up you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />[...]ent to Maggie's awesomeness: Linger starts to dive into what causes the change from human to wolf and vice versa.

0446567337|1.0|I managed to watch the entire movie and it started out really strong. It was a joy to watch and then it just got bad. The plot went from topic to topic I had no idea what was going on or what the underlying message was supposed to be. For me, this is the worst movie of the year.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|I watched the theatrical version of Donnie Darko multiple times. I loved it, and really enjoyed how it played with my mind. It was just one of those movies that I could watch over and over, and the humor never got old. It is a comedy, with sci-fi undertones, but it is also so much more. Everything in the movie clicked just right, and watching it is always a real joy. When I saw the directors cut, I immediately realized what I had been missing just watching the theatrical version, and I liked it even more. I think personally, you have to watch the theatrical release first, and really think about it, and then watch the Directors Cut and enjoy all the added explainations. The directors cut is a much more solid movie, and everythiing is more crisp, and clear. All of the questions I was left wondering about after watching the theatrical release were answered for me in the directors cut, and that was great. I hear complaints that it took the mystery out of the movie. Well, if Donnie Darko had been a mystery movie, that would suck, but it wasnt', it was a Dark Comedy. The directors cut didn't take any of the darkness, or the comedy out of the movie, it simply made it make more sense. I don't see how any true fan of Donnie Darko could not like seeing a fuller version of the movie they claim to like. The directors cut doesn't take anything away from the movie, it just adds to it. Everything that is added is done so with great care, and only enhances the original film. It made a really, really good movie into a great movie.

0446563048|4.0|Very readable and enjoyable account of how Tony Hsieh and his team built Zappos from nothing to over $1 billion in gross merchandise sales.  The book is full of copies of historical emails and other accounts that really add to the story.<br /><br />My biggest takeaway:  Zappos set out to be the best at customer service i.e. delivering WOW and staying true to their culture.  They did not set out to be the best at selling shoes on line - they set their sights much higher.  I think that is what allowed them to achieve what they did with laser focus.<br /><br />Almost gave this five stars.  Very inspiring.
0143036556|1.0|As usual, Jared has produced a work of almost unimaginable drivel.    On page 285 he describes New Guineans as \\"more curious and experimental than any other people.\\"  As proof, he offers a story of how they did not know the use of pencils and instead had used them as \\"a plug through the pierced nasal septum.\\"  In other words, as a bone through their noses!    These stone aged people, who have no written language and wear no clothes, are only described as being \\"primitive\\" with quotation marks, and only as seeming so to Europeans.  Since their civilization did not collapse, they are seemingly only included in the tale to demonstrate that Europeans are \\"horrified\\" (page 281), \\"don't understand\\" (page 280), \\"innovations failed\\" (page 281) and \\"come to appreciate\\" (page 282).    In short, New Guineans are the golden example that Europeans fail to meet.    He then claims that terrain ruggedness had confined European explorers to the coast for 400 years, when a far more likely explanation is that the people of New Guinea are well known to be the world's most notorious cannibals!    When discussing the marvelous examples that they set, Jared makes no mention of how they bless their new homes with blood by decapitating a victim and dragging the headless body around the perimeter, or how they cover the skulls of those they have eaten with black bee's wax and cowry shells.    Although I am sure that the Ivy League loony liberal bigots for whom these works are written have taken it all as gospel.
B001CDF05O|5.0|EC enough said, however I must.  This recording is basically the  set list on one more car one more rider.  I have that one and like it as well.  This however has a more intimate and   layered appeal, Layla cut is my favorite.  My wife and I own over 50 CD's of EC  so I would say this is in my top 5.

I'll admit to it I am one of those fans. having said that, I was looking forward to this release I equired this at a different place but I feel I have to make my statement about it. There are Jems on here for all to hear Demo's, bsides,versions never heard etc. Not going to give to much away I'll just say you'll be surprised by this set. I give this 5 stars.
B000VXLC3K|5.0|My wife and I went to see James Taylor and Carole King in concert and ran out to buy this CD set.  Great stuff.  The first CD is set to full background music support while the second CD is more intimate. Carole sings the same songs playing the piano as her sole background.  Even though they are the same songs, they sound completely different, almost as if you were listening to her in a small club.  Do yourself a favor and own this set.  It already is a \\"classic\\".
B003HGKJ3W|5.0|Now this Album is my favorite album of all time by a-ha because it is the first album I ever heard, I played the tape to death, it's probably saying \\"Thank god he's not playing me anymore\\" but I'm getting off topic.

B000NY17J6|3.0|I was disappointed with this CD set because the sound quality seems \\"inverted\\".  It might be a bad reproduction.  Instead of projecting sound into the room, the sound is a bit muted and seems to be moving backward, into the speakers.  I have to turn up the volume to get any listening satisfaction with this album. (I have an audiophile-quality system and a good ear.)The songs are great, and so is Linda Ronstadt, but this CD doesn't move me much.
0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis complains in the opening chapter of this book that his earlier work on Wall Street, Liar's Poker, had the perverse effect of encouraging the thing he meant to condemn. Well, he's got that same problem again with The Big Short primarily because he writes so well and with such momentum about a subject most of us, I suspect, had previously considered arcane and well, boring. In the present work he structures his recounting around a few individuals, oddballs all, who were prescient enough to see the coming collapse of the subprime mortgage bubble years before the rest of the world and especially years before the financial world. He has an almost avuncular style, stopping to clearly explain in footnotes what were abstruse jargon, that energetically drives his story to an ending we are at once curious about and yet already know. While it felt pretty clear whose side he is on, describing with incredulity the workings (or non-workings) of the securitization market (which created the mortgage backed securities at the center of the meltdown) it is only on the last two or so pages of the book that he delivers the dyspeptic punch line - the people who were shorted were you and me, the taxpayer, that people on both sides of the bet that was the subprime mess (the Wall Street bond brokers and those who had the vision to see the coming calamity of those brokers' actions) left the field rich. We, the taxpaying public, those watching the transfer of middle class wealth to the already wealthy, are left to deal with the fallout.
0553381687|5.0|I decided to finally reading this after hearing about the new show coming out.  I have been a fantasy reader since I was in middle school but for some reason I wasn't interested in this series.  I think my initial misgivings were due the fact that most reviews seemed to say that there are a lot of characters, main characters die a lot, and that there was a lot of sex.<br />I don't really agree with any of these.  The sex is sparse and not detailed(a good thing since I think that sex distracts from a story) and not many characters have died(at least in the first book).<br />There are quite a few POV's from different characters as their storylines progress but most of the POV's are interesting and well written.<br />Nothing is really black and white with his characters and the world is so well imagined that you can be attached and unattached with a character at the same time.  Even if a character I like dies I think I wouldn't mind it because you get a sense that is just the way that world is.  It will be interesting to see how the series progresses.

So I decided one day just listening to the whole thing and it was nice now I like most songs on the cd except daddy's home since plies is not on the one from the actual cd. But his Confession Album was the best one he made, honestly!!!!!!!!!!!!

B003QNXPUK|1.0|This product was recommended to me by one of my good friends. I bought this for my iphone 4, installation is not a big deal, it was very easy to install. But my problem is with the quality of this product, I will list few of the problems I am having with it. And I have decided to return this back although they are going to charge me a restocking fee.    1. This screen protector has lots of friction when you move your finger over it, it's not smooth at all as comapred to the screen protector sold by Apple.  2. After couple of weeks you will start noticing some air gaps on the edges of the phone.  3. If you look it under some light you will notice that this screen protector is really bumpy.  4. It's tough to get rid of finger prints from this screen protector.  5. And when I compare this screen protector with the one sold by Apple, it looks ugly.  6. Quality is really bad.  7. If you compare this quality with price of it, it's tooooo expensive.    People who like this product might have their own reasons but I am not happy with it at all.

B003HARV3Y|2.0|Can anyone answer this simple question?  Why does Hollywood constantly feel the need to take an existing property that's loved by millions and turn it into something that bears almost zero resemblance to the source material?  I just don't get it.  Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The lightening thief is yet another sad example of this far too often occurring phenomenon.    Don't get me wrong, I am not a super fan of the book.  I thought the book was entertaining, but pretty mediocre.  That being said though-I still expected a decent movie.  My first reaction after seeing it though was...\\"huh?\\"  and \\"Did I miss something?\\"  First off, it was completely wrong in tone.  Granted, the book is very contemporary as are the characters, but at its heart it's still a fantasy.  The movie by comparison tried to be some uber-cool teeney bopper road trip flick that just didn't fit the context of the story.  Second, there are missing characters (Ares anyone?), tons of missing scenes and even a major plot point that's completely absent.  Also-the kids seem way too old.  And what was up with Grover?  The Grover from the book is completely gone-replaced by a completely different character that totally misses the point of who Grover really is.    Even if you ignore the book, I still don't think this is a very good movie.  Besides a couple of really cool scenes and really cool creatures-this movie came off as kind of obnoxious.  Good casting on the adults though (Ares, Poseidon, Athena, Chiron) as well as Percy & Luke, but I can't say much for the rest of the cast.  The actor who played Grover was pretty good, but like I mentioned-completely wrong for the character.  Just like Eragon & The Golden Compass  I doubt there will be anymore books in this series developed into films.  And rightfully so.  Maybe they should have stuck just a little closer to the source material instead of ignoring 90% of it.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I was not a Lost watcher or fan....in fact Lost had me, well lost! BUT Flash Forward was such a smart, action packed show! It has to be one of the best shows ABC has ever had and I (along with millions of others) think they made a HUGE mistake by cancelling it!    It starts out with literally, everyone in the entire world (except a few suspicous people) blacking out and have a \\"flash forward\\" into the future as a \\"dream\\". When eveyone wakes up panic ensues from car crashes, and injuries everywhere (not to mention sheer confusion over what just happened)but when that settles down, people start talking about what their dreams, only to discover that bits and pieces start lining up to prove that these weren't just dreams but a look into the actual future.     Joseph Fiennes is excellent in this roller coaster ride of an awesome 1st season!!! MUST SEE!!
B0036EH3XE|2.0|I sincerely wish I didn't have to give the final season my favorite show of all time a bad review, but despite all the good episodes like Ab Aeterno, Across the Sea and Happily Ever After, this season was ultimately ruined by the travesty that is The End.  Many people have already pointed out the piece garbage this episode is and how it ruined the series so I will not go into depth on it.  Ultimately I give this episode 2 out of 5, and the title of Black Stain like the box art portrays.

B002JCSWVG|4.0|Somehow, Clint can't quite put a foot wrong lately, and while this movie does not perhaps match his directorial highs, it's a great solid entry and well worth seeing.  But perhaps it's not best served being described as an Eastwood movie - this is Morgan Freeman's film.  This is the role he has been aching to play - Nelson Mandela, and Mandela himself said it was Freeman should play him in any movie depicting him.  This is not the whole life story of Mandela though, it's a snapshot, used to illustrate the character and charisma of the man.  The moment is the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and charts Mandela's conviction that the Rugby was a chance to unite the blacks and whites in a moment of national pride, to finally give truth to his `rainbow nation'.  As such, and given the facts are well known, it's a fairly predictable movie - you know what happens.  What's more, some of the allegories for the bigger picture - the animosity between the white and black bodyguards breaking down as rugby unites them - are a little too trite.  There's a nagging feeling that a bigger more complicated picture is not explored - after all, is South Africa now everything Mandela wanted it to be?  Perhaps it's just unkind to complain about these little niggles.. in much the same way that the rugby purists who say the rugby isn't quite right are missing the point.  This is about Mandela, and his people, and it tells a remarkable story, no matter how simplified and streamlined it is here.  Who could fail but be moved by Matt Damon standing in Mandela's actual cell and start to comprehend what the man went through, and the level of forgiveness he exhibited.  Matt Damon does fine, if not inspiring.  Perhaps an actual South African actor would have been more convincing.. it's hard not to be constantly aware that you're looking at Damon, not a rugby team captain.  His dissimilarity in height and stature to the rugby team captain is well documented, but not that relevant to his impact on screen.  Freeman though is... well, just IS Mandela.  He inhabits the role so naturally that it hardly seems worth mentioning.. like that's just the way it's meant to be.  And the cinematography, particularly in crisp bluray hi-def, is wonderful.  And even those rugby scenes.. for the non-purists among you, they do a good enough job of giving a flavour of being in a match, to make the final game a suitable climax.  As an aside, let's not forget this is a period movie.  And with a clever blend of discreet special effects, clever photography and typically fastidious  art direction, the mid 90's are perfectly evoked.  Politics are explored, Mandela's character is explored, rugby is explored.. it's a lot to cover.  Some elements, such as a deeper understanding of the political context, the solitary black player on the team, or Mandela's home life, are sacrificed as a result of covering so much ground.  But it's still riveting viewing, educational and uplifting, and a recommended watch.
B001FB4W16|5.0|Vampires from the south.  Can you get any better than that.  They have southern accents.  Who would've thought.  This show has very good character developmant.  I like the fact that just dives right into the vampire theme.  Then later on you are introduced to other creatures such as a shape shifter.  This show has many surprises.  It's never boring.  Watch True Blood and you will be happy you did.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|Death Proof has a simple concept. Kurt Russell plays a stunt man who has rigged his souped-up car with roll bars and other safety devices so that during an accident it will be \\"death proof\\". He then travels the south looking for attractive young women he can terrorize and kill with said car. The movie is broken into 2 parts with Kurt stalking one group of 4 women, then starting over with another group.    Death Proof is photographed beautifully, acted well and has some interesting dialogue but overall is very boring. The only part that leaves a lasting memory is a head-on car crash shown over and over from different angles. It takes about 45 minutes to get to the crash and its over in 15 seconds. Tarantino is so enthralled with the dialogue he wrote he lets the movie meander around like it's out for a Sunday stroll which is boring to watch.
0399156577|2.0|I am a huge Nora Roberts fan as well as a dog lover.  While the training narratives were not boring for me because I am very interested in search and rescue, the rest of the book fell short of my expectations.  Plus, where did her language come from.  I don't remember her main characters cussing so much.  I thought that was a bit over the top for my tastes.  I think Nora Roberts' storytelling is much better in her Bride quartet that she has going now.  I agree with one other review I read, it wasn't one of hers that I just couldn't put down until I was done.  Better luck next time!
0800177177|1.0|Unwatchable. Coppola is sour on every note. Oldman's Dracula looks like a 92 year old drag-queen. Renfield turns up as a reject from a bad MTV video. And Keanu is, well, Keanu. The story-line is barely held together... scenes occur at random without connection to one another. If I hadn't read the book, I wonder if I'd have been able to piece together what was going on? (Not that the movie follows the book; but that's a different topic). After the 3rd time Dracula's eyes super-imposed in the dark clouds as people laughed for no reason in the rain, I had to turn this garbage off.
B001N26GFM|5.0|Gut the film of a few clich&eacute;s and the unintentional humor (some of their more obvious attempts at subtle statements come across slightly amusing) and you'd have a near perfect example of the gritty realities of human weakness.  Yes, the Holocaust, one of the most brutal and overall disgusting `black spots' in human history is given a fresh take in this spellbinding and heartbreaking tale about a young boy oblivious to the horrors his specious is capable of.<br /><br />Makes you sick just thinking about it.<br /><br />The film follows a young boy named Bruno who moves with his family to the countryside.  His father, a high ranking official in the SS troops, has been promoted and so the move is necessary.  Bruno is less than enthused about leaving his friends, but upon arriving at his new home (which is beautiful) he notices a farm out in the distance, and there are children working in the farm.  From the looks of them, they are strange to him, but he is curious.  Despite his parents concern with his venturing `out back', Bruno (who is obsessed with adventure books) decides to sneak away and find the farm.  When he gets there he meets a young boy named Shmuel (pronounced almost like `small').  Young Bruno (and to a degree Shmuel) are oblivious to the truth about the farm.  Bruno is taught that Jews are disgusting people who are less than human and that they are responsible for the fall of German society.  He is also misguided into thinking that the Jews are being properly cared for.  Shmuel is kept in the dark about the eventualities about his stay at the farm.  The two boys strike a friendship and a bond that transcends society's boundaries.<br /><br />If only we could all be as innocent as children.<br /><br />That was one of the main things I gathered from this movie.  I loved the way that it brilliantly captured the forgiving and understanding quality that children possess.  They can see through to the heart of a person.  Even after young Bruno betrays his friend, causing him serious harm, Shmuel forgives him almost instantly, understanding that Bruno was not malicious or hurtful but merely frightened and acted without thinking.  If they had been adults, it would have most likely resulted in a longstanding grudge and retaliation.<br /><br />Another point I gathered from this film, a point I think is remarkably strong, is that not every German completely understood or even agreed with what was taking place.  The character of Elsa, the mother, in particular is a strong one.  She was a woman who was brainwashed by a nation to believe in a `cause' that was horrific in itself, but when she discovered what was being done to the Jews at that farm she was mortified.  It destroyed her.  She was raised to hate them and to believe that they were the enemy, but she was not evil enough to forget that they were human beings.<br /><br />I'm shocked at the poor reception this film garnered, but then again I think many people viewed this as a children's film, which it is not.  In fact, unless you want to answer a lot of uncomfortable and difficult questions, I'd keep the kids FAR away from this movie.<br /><br />That said, the film is borderline genius to be honest.  I mean, I can see the films few flaws and there are some areas I wish were cleaned up a tad, but overall this film simply has everything it needs.  From the brilliant performances (Vera Farmiga is a goddess and young Asa Butterfield probably should have been nominated for an Oscar) to the beautiful sets and stunning camera work to the chilling screenplay that uses a fresh perspective to twist the knife a tad deeper, `The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' is a stunning film that truly deserves to be seen and discussed.friend, causing him serious harm, Shmuel forgives him almost instantly, understanding that Bruno was not malicious or hurtful but merely frightened and acted without thinking.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This 2009 flick is Pixar's most imaginitive film to date.   In the 1930s, a wide-eyed lad with glasses, flight goggles, and a helmet over them named Carl Fredericksen(Jeremy Leary)sits before a movie screen in a cinema full of equally awed viewers, watching a newsreel featuring his personal hero, aviator and explorer, Charles Muntz( Christopher Plummer)have his career chronicled in an episode ending with his discreditation over a discovery he claimed to have made.Muntz vows never to return from the jungles of South America until he can prove his discovery valid.   Upon leaving the theatre, Carl's young life skips merrily along, until, to his great surprise, he meets the wild, red-haired Ellie(Elie Docter), with whom the staid and quiet young boy shares a passion for flight, and develops a desire to travel to Pardise Falls in South America, since Charles Muntz is her personal hero, as well.   Eventually, they grow up, and marry to the delight of Ellie's boisterous backwoods family, and Carl's elegantly staid family.   They go directly to their dream house, the old boarded-up cottage where they used to pretend they were exploring in a dirigible.   Over the years, Carl is employed as a balloon vendor at a local zoo, where Ellie works as a guide.In their spare time, they picnic on a hill and describe what they see in the clouds.   After learning that Ellie cannot have children, Carl brings her out of her depression by reminder her of her dream to visit South America, and they begin saving for it. Their dream is waylaid by unforseen expenses, and Life's calamities.Life continues, and they grow old together. Sadly Ellie passes away  before their dream can be fullfilled.   Carl retired to the house he and Ellie shared. But things will not be quiet for very long.    The city literally begins to spring up around the Frederickson's cottage. Danny Mann's construction worker, Steve, working on behalf of his foreman, Tom(John Ratzenberger), unsuccessfully tries for the umpteenthtime to buy the property.    At the same time, a Junior Wilderness explorer named Russell( Jordan Nagai), arrives at Carl's door, hoping to acquire his \\"Assisting the Elderly\\" badge.Carl declines the offer, and diverts the boy.   Legal trouble results in Carl's being committed to an assisted living home. Two male nurses(Donald Fullilove, and Jess Harrell) arrive to escort him to his new home.   But guided by Ellie's spirit, he trumps them all by releasing a mountain of balloons tied to the roof of his house, which pull the house away from its moorings, to the astonishment of the nurses, of a little girl playing in her bedroom in her apartment  highrise, whose world is momentarily but gloriously bathed in an array of colors by the balloon's reflections, and by sundry townspeople.   \\"We're on our way, Ellie!\\" Carl solemnly declares as he steers the flying wooden vessel, making his late wife's childhood imaginings a reality.   He is given an unexpected companion  for the journey. Young Russell was caught on the porch when the voyage began, and while Carl is initially reluctant to let him in, the chatty lad is soon given a chance to earn his badge for assisting the elderly in a way he never expected.   They reach South America with a thunderous jolt, and manage to tie themselves to the floating house as they explore the jungle.   They encounter a rainbow colored flightless bird, whom Russell entices with chocolate and names \\"Kevin\\", and a mysterious dog with a talking collar named Dug (Bob Peterson). Once again, curmudgeonly Carl accepts the company of both, only reluctantly.But the companionship of both will be invaluable.   The old man and the boy form a bond during their adventure. The widowered septegenarian learns why the young scout is in need of a father figure who will stand beside him when he receives his final badge.   As they doggedly approach Paradise Falls, the spot where Ellie had dreamt of having a house, since childhood, they find themselves diverted bya pack of canines, who, like Dug, have collars enabling them to talk. The most notable of these are the Doberman, Alpha( also voiced by Bob Peterson), and Beta (Delroy Lindo), a bulldog, and another dog named Gamma(Jerome Ranft).   The dogs'owner, as it turns out, is Charles Muntz, and Carl is delighted to meet his boyhood hero.But Carl and Russell realize Muntz's sinister designs on Kevin and must fight to save the bird.Despite Carl's initial refusal to get involved when Kevin is seized, Russell's derring-do forces him to act, ultimately giving the phrase, \\"Spirit of Adventure\\" a whole new meaning.   In the end, we see how a lonely widower's life is renewed after loss, and how sorrow gives way to new adventures, new hope, and new joys, if we allow it.   I would give this delightful fantasy the Ellie Badge.    In the final analysis, \\"Up\\" is simply \\"Up-lifting\\"!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Taking a more serious tone, Eminem's sophomore album `The Marshall Mathers LP' has a harder time gaining traction than his debut album did.  I know that quite a few of Eminem's fans consider this his best album, but I'm not in that group.  It is a solid release, and it does contain some of his best (or at least his most memorable) tracks, but in the end the album comes across uneven and unfocused, and it loses a few points for that.<br /><br />The album actually opens on a near brilliant front and carries that torch for the entire first half of the album before teetering on unfocused ridiculousness.<br /><br />The intensity that unleashes itself on the albums opener, `Kill You', is pretty straightforward.  One must remember that Eminem is NOT to be taken seriously.  If you fail to keep that prospective then you may find yourself a tad nauseous.  Still, on tracks like the all-too-real `Kim', Eminem seems to cross a line that isn't easy to come back from.  Even a fan of his (like myself) can find it difficult to find tracks with that much realism comfortable.  `Kill You' has a very thin line of comic relief to keep it accessible and entertaining.  `Kim' loses that humor and replaces it with shocking segments that make it unsettling to say the least.  That's kind of what I mean about uneven.  Eminem is at his best when he is saying things that are repulsive in content yet humorous in texture.  When he forgets to add those layers of humor he steps over into territory that makes the listener uncomfortable.  That's why songs like `Who Knew' and `The Real Slim Shady' work so well.  Eminem clowning around makes for a fun filled afternoon of lyrical debauchery.<br /><br />Now, that isn't to say that Eminem cannot tackle weighty issues with admirable results.  Remember how well he saddled his debut with tracks like `Rock Bottom'?  Songs like `Stan' (arguably one of the best songs Eminem has ever recorded), `Marshall Mathers' and `The Way I Am' are very strong dramatic contenders.  These songs are dark, laced with a realistic approach to humanity that elevates Eminem's visionary expression.<br /><br />At track nine, with `Remember Me', the album starts to falter.  `Remember Me' just feels clunky and unfocused.  It's not smooth and it isn't really edgy.  It feels kind of fake.  `Amityville' is very much the same in style and ending result.  It just feels like a failed experiment.  The guest rappers enlisted really fail to add anything to the tracks, since they pale in comparison to Eminem's abilities.  Once he comes on he crushes them.<br /><br />Thankfully `Please II' features qualified guest artists.<br /><br />`Drug Ballad' is fun, but it also just feels like `Cum on Everybody' redux.  `I'm Back' and `Under the Influence' have their moments (especially `I'm Back') but overall they don't have the `pop' needed to hold up against the albums first half.<br /><br />The closing track, `Criminal', is just effortless in tone and overall one of the best tracks on the album.  It's flawless.  It was the best way for the album to close for it almost makes you forget about the misfortune of tracks like `Remember Me'.  In the end this album us a solid effort and a nice follow up to `The Slim Shady LP'.  Sandwiched between his debut and `The Eminem Show' (which are his two best albums) this one gets put on the backburner sometimes (by me) but listening to it this past week (getting ready for this review) has made me respect it a little more.  It has it's flaws (some of them blaringly obvious) but it also contains some of Eminem's richest rhymes and some of his more daring experiments (as much as I kind of loathe `Kim', it was a very big risk and in a way it paid off).dark, laced with a realistic approach to humanity that elevates Eminem's visionary expression.

0061906220|5.0|I was extremely disappointed to read the School Library Journal's review of Pete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes.  As the owner of a children's bookstore in Decatur, Georgia, I have had a very different experience.    Pete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes has been on the New York Times' Bestseller List for several weeks and has been the best selling book in our store's history.  The reason the book has done so well -- incredibly well for an unknown author and illustrator -- is because Pete is a superb book.    Author Eric Litwin has a considerable history of working with children as a teacher, storyteller, and musician.  As a result of years of work, Eric has developed an excellent rapport with kids and a deep understanding of how to connect with them using a variety of approaches.    A former electrical engineer, James Dean found his true calling in his second career as a painter.  Pete the Cat is a character James created over ten years ago and who has come to be recognized and beloved all over the Atlanta area.    Eric had an idea for a story involving Pete, and subsequently met James by random chance on an Atlanta street.  The collaboration began.  Drafts were written and sketches were revised.  Advice was sought and heeded.  When James and Eric were satisfied with their work, the two published the book themselves, selling it on their own and through a handful of bookstores.  (Little Shop of Stories was one such store.)    (This is not how a children's picture book typically comes together.  In the vast majority of circumstances, an author will submit a manuscript to a publisher.  Upon acceptance, an editor will be assigned the key task of selecting an illustrator whose work will not only complement the text but bring an added dimension.  There are excellent exceptions where an author and illustrator will submit their work as a team.  Jacky Davis and David Soman write and illustrate the Ladybug Girl books.  (They're married to each other.)  Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith (their wives were co-workers) did The True Story of the Three Little Pigs together and went on to do The Stinky Cheese Man and other books.)    The book sold fantastically well and was subsequently published by Harper Collins.  For good reason.    For a children's picture book to be truly successful, it must work for both the child as well as the adult who is asked to read it 100 times.  Or more.    From the grownup perspective, Pete is fun to read.  The text has a rhythm to it.  One can sing the refrain.  After only a few reads one can successfully encourage the child to participate.  (\\"Goodness no!\\")  At the same time the parent knows that the younger child is learning colors and the older child, because of the repetition and the visual clues, can begin to learn to read.  The illustrations are bright and lively, creative and surreal, and work perfectly with the text.     There is also a moral to Pete's story.    For the child, the book is just fun.

B002OHDRF2|2.0|This film could have been really good but it seemed like have way through it they seemed to have lost the concept or direct they were headed and fell back to what was already done before. The last half of the film had to many things that were taken and repeated from the first two films, and it just seems overally tacky...such as when the terminatior used his dad's voice to find john in the steel stairway are and then we he John tried shooting the guy and loading the gun again, or with the steel and then trying to freze him all of these were taken from T2. The only thing that was orignial and creative about this film was the future termiator who was more human than ever and was the only real likable character in the whole film, which they should have just centered the movie around versus the route they ended up going.  This film was alot better than the third film in the installment of films but not by much.

079284131X|3.0|Child's Play takes on a different way on approaching what may be known as the `slasher' genre.  Unlike the others like Halloween, Friday the 13th or even Nightmare on Elm Street where it involves what resembles a normal person killing people throughout the movie.  Child's Play goes for a different approach, something that no other movie done in my opinion.  While the killer Charles Lee Ray, better known as `The Lakeshore Strangler' is killed in the beginning of the movie, but that don't stop him from transferring his `soul' into a body of a doll, yes a doll.  The doll eventually ends up in the hands of a 6 year old boy named Andy Barcley, and that's when the fun begins there.  The doll now known as `Chucky' trying to find a way to become human again and tries everything he can to get into Andy's body, and he'll go through big lengths to make that happen.  With the effects used in this movie, it's amazing what they were able to pull this movie and make it creepy to an extent.  Overall I give this movie 3.5 stars out of 5.

I don't think we will ever watch it again.  It certainly failed our toddler's critical review.  She announced, as it was ending, \\"I don't like it.\\"  This from a child who, if she likes a film, asks to see it over and over again.  She loves Horton (Hears a Who), Up, Kung Fu Panda, and the Bizard (Wizard) of Oz. She will sit through long films from beginning to end.  But this one she needed some minor cohersion to get through.

0143118420|1.0|The biggest mystery of \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is its popularity.  Why on earth do people like this book?  All it did was really annoy me.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if everyone had the luxury of opting out of real life for a year to embark on a voyage of self-discovery?  I don't think there's anything remarkable about her journey or insights (at least until half-way through Indonesia, which is where I gave up on this incredibly vapid memoir).  I think it was the incessant whining that really got me.  The reality of divorce recovery is such a far cry from the self-indulgent ramblings presented in this book that I don't feel Ms. Gilbert deserves any kind of congratulations.  Normal people have to deal with work, and kids, and paying the bills, and not getting child support.  Show me a story from a woman who figures out how to discover herself while maintaining a household and we might be getting somewhere.
0061564893|1.0|This title was intriguing to me so I began to wade through the book. Like some of the other reviewers, I also questioned Menzies' sources and methodologies. I am a retired librarian with a passion for the historically odd. Even I had a hard time swallowing the massive coincidences that all seemed to fall together. Granted, some events 'could' happen but if they do not hold up under scrutiny, corroboration, and validation then they must be discarded or revised. The scientific method works for history also.<br /><br />What got to me, besides the many amazing coincidences, was the redundant restating of his assertions - to the point of pleading. I began to wonder if Menzies got paid by the word. I also began to question his methodology and scholarship when he was stumped with translating a particularly hard bit of medieval language, so he prayed to the Virgin and had a cheese sandwich. I am also a man of faith, but never in my years of scholarly writing have I ever stated that I prayed, meditated, or wore my lucky shoes while researching and stumped...which I have. That sort of thing would have put my credibility into the realm of the metaphysical. Besides not being professional it is an unnecessary statement. Likewise, his travelogues, being reminded that he was a submarine commander, and that the scholarly community hasn't been favorably inclined to him weren't very useful. It made me think that he was pleading for someone to believe him because he had some position of authority. For a supposedly scholarly book it was entirely too anecdotal...even with the 'references.'<br /><br />The first third of the book was entertaining from a purely speculative history point of view. The rest was tiresome and repetitive. I would never say don't buy a book (being an advocate of reading) but I would suggest that this one be put low on your list of potential books to read.
B003J27WFW|5.0|OK, first off I've been a devoted Rush fan since first hearing 2112 on my brother's turntable in 1976. Since then, no band has captured my attention as much as Rush. the fact that the band has churned out over 20 albums and no 2 sound the same is an amazing achievement. That coupled with the distinct evolutions in their musicianship and experimentation have always intrigued me that a band could 'get away with all that'.    I knew their history well, but the movie opened my eyes up to many things I didn't know. The early era footage as teenagers and that priceless film of Alex openly defying his parents at the dinner table about his high school diploma aspirations are nothing short of pure gold. The story of the three being so committed to their own ideals and musical development are something to be revered. How the launch of Fly By Night took their sound in a dfferent direction from the straight ahead hard rocking of their eponymous album, and worried Mercury records execs, to their about face into Caress of Steel and alienating almost every supporter and backer in the process. It was enlightening to hear of the Down the Tubes tour and playing Battle Creek Michigan with Ted Nugent to a wild adoring crowd of about 20 folks... After all that and then seeing their decision to 'go down in flames' by standing by their decision to cut and release 2112 amidst manager Ray Danniels pandering to record execs that they were going to release an album of 'singles' instead. The balls these guys had must have been enormous - and you certainly have to respect them for that, even if you don't like their music. A band with unquestionable integrity - now thats an anomaly    The film is filled with insightful tidbits like this. Another piece I found enlightening was Alex vocalizing his displeasure at the amount of keybooard use the band had been pursuing in the mid 80s. I shared that belief but never realized that he felt the same way.    Lots of great music and the DVD is packed withabout 90 min of extras, so I'd highly recommend it; not just for the die hard Rush fan, but for anyone who is interested in a documentary of incredibly talented, uncompromsing musicians that never got swept up in the wave of fame or ego and still play to sell out crowds 40+ years into their career.    Added note... If you haven't heard them yet, do yourself a favour and check out the music of Porcupine Tree. Another assembly of amazing musicians with a large catalog possibly even more progressive and diverse than Rush's.
B002CAWNEM|1.0|Can anyone tell me why some singer of cheesy ballads always gets an acting career? Didn't they learn anything from Jlo?    Totally predictable, and both the husband ( object of crazy obsession, and long suffering husband that no one believes Idris Elba)and the wildly sex crazed temp, Ali Lauter are servicable in this waste of screen. But Beyonce is a wash out, and the only time you can believe her character is when she goes all ghetto on the temp. I don't care how much money Jayz and Ditty have, why do the studios allow these talantless singers to have an acting job to start with, will they ever learn?    Save your money, save your time.

0545123283|3.0|I think this book might have been better if it would have been more of a companion novel instead of an actual sequel.  With 4 narratives, the story seems almost mundane at times.  Grace and Sam's story feels like it's just going through the motions.  I wonder if  the author included them because she was afraid her fans would be uupset if she left them out.  I actually preferred the story when it was told from Isabel and Cole's points of view.  I think it would have be just fine with just those two.  We still would have got some of the story of Sam and Grace, but I think it would have felt more intense from an outside point of view.  In fact, I was really annoyed with Grace at times.  I'm not sure I'm a big fan of the attitude teenagers get with their parents in today's fiction.  I wonder if it sets a bad example...<br />The book still has that wonderful poetic flow.  It's easy to get caught up the story even if you're not enjoying it as much as you would like.  I don't think fans of Shiver will be disappointed!

B000TEUSJK|1.0|I read an interview with one of the principals (O'Toole?) in which he said he ran into Gielgud on the plane on the way to filming this miasma and that both he and Gielgud pretended to be on their way somewhere else, neither realizing that the other had been bribed into appearing in this sad yet expensive waste material.    Funny thing is that I think I saw it when it first appeared, imagining incorrectly that it might be more erotic than bleak.  Afterward, I pretended I had seen a different film.  Closest I'll ever get to being like O'Toole or Gielgud.    I only visited this site because I was curious about a Roger Ebert quote that linked to it.  I wondered what Ebert would identify as a depressing film he couldn't sit through.  I assumed it would be a current film, but I think it's still worth warning people about this discouraging garbage.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I'll try to avoid repeating the product description and tell you the basic facts.   I did not know about this DVD until I saw it at the store. The packaging was better than usual for a doc.' The disc covered things things I did not know about like their early years as a high school band. Seeing John Rutsy playing with them was a kick.  This probably was the most informative and entertaing DVD about the band.  For those who watch the first disc and say \\"hey, they didn't talk about that etc.\\" Watch the bonus disc it answers most of those questions.  The only thing they don't cover are the live albums and that silly CD full of covers that came out a few years ago.  Worth the investment.  P.S. as of this date 7/26/10 Rush is on tour doing the Moving Pictures CD live.
B002ZG981E|5.0|In an era of recycled material, adaptations and reboots it's great to see an original concept. Even more gratifying is that Inception is a film that is intellectually stimulating. One that doesn't cater to the lowest common denominator like so many action films. Christopher Nolan also doesn't fall into the trap of being too complex that he loses his audience. While this is certainly a movie to pay attention to the structure of - you will not need extensive research before, during or after to understand what is happening (or has happened). In other words, it's not so enamored with being smart that it's too smart for it's own good. The movie is visually stunning but this is not a movie that breaks new ground ala Avatar. The CGI is there to support the story. It isn't the story. Nor does it distract from it. There are undoubtedly some very slick visuals and the \\"hotel fight\\" is certainly impressive and a joy to watch, but if you go into this thinking CGI is the main point, well, you'll be disappointed. The point is far deeper and muti layered. A contextual story within a story about dreams within dreams. It's a feast for the mind, senses and heart. The cast is excellent without exception. DiCaprio certainly is the \\"star\\" but the supporting cast, especially Gordon-Levitt, Hardy and Wantanabe are not outclassed in any way. Each delivers and adds to the film. Ellen Page's role has me a little less convinced. At times I found her annoying and distracting from the mood. Perhaps it's the way her obviously bright character seems to go from novice to teacher in a matter of seconds on the concept of extraction and inception. At one point she knows nothing and is just a brash and aggressive savant but quickly shifts into lecturing the experts in a way that turned me off. Hans Zimmer's rhythmic score is almost a character in an of itself adding as much to the films impact as the visuals, much o the same effect as his excellent score did in The Dark Knight. This movie is getting generally terrific critical reception. Much of the criticism has focused on it's length, limited emotional impact and ending. There isn't a minute of this film that I think is wasted time. Every second of it is either exposition or scenes that are essential and move the story forward. I can't imagine a scene that I'd have cut. Maybe on a repeat viewing I'll find one. This isn't Steel Magnolias but I wouldn't call it a science fiction film without a heart. The DiCaprio - Cotilliard understory worked for me. I can't see how, absent making this even longer, that story could be much more effective. True I could have cared more about the relationships between the team members. Especially Arthur and Cobb who have clearly been together a long time. Perhaps more depth could have been provided with the page character or more humanity to Saito's backstory so we would have felt for him during his difficulties more -- but hey -- all that would have taken even MORE time. I think Nolan did the best he could within the confines of one long film. Had this been a trilogy maybe it could have hit the triple crown on all points, but I think Nolan made wise, efficient choices. While I can certainly understand how some are upset with or perplexed by the ending I thought it was absolutely sublime and perfect. It certainly does set up a place to begin again if Nolan chooses, but I don't feel cheated at all or manipulated as so many less skilled director's efforts at the same effect leave me feeling. All in all Inception is an excellent film. Fresh, original, smart and at times moving. This is a film I think begs for repeat viewing and will age well and be even more appreciated as it is seen again. I'm ready to start testing that hypothesis right now.

B002ZG980U|5.0|A film like Inception only comes along once a decade, and it's no surprise it took Writer/Director Christopher Nolan over ten years to polish the screenplay into its final form. The loud and frenetic visuals in the trailer all fall into place when you see the film, which represents a masterful blend of genres and ideas, some of which have been attempted before but never in this combination. Unlike so many Jerry Bruckheimer visual onslaughts or the recycled franchises that use continuous split-second cuts to replace plot, the major set pieces in the film leave the audience literally on the edge of their seats, and it's one of the few blockbusters in memory that can be enjoyed as both a top-notch action movie and a deeply cerebral experience.<br /><br />In fact, Inception is a perfect film on so many levels that it's breathtaking to watch. Apart from the technical wizardry of bringing some of the mind-bending visuals to the screen, the real triumph is in conveying its complex, layered concepts and plot lines in a way that never lectures or loses the audience and never takes a break from the action to lay down exposition. Unlike the sequels to the Matrix, where the attempt to develop the alternate reality of the first film became convoluted and ludicrous in the second and third installments, Inception has enough fresh ideas to feel like an entire trilogy perfectly woven into one coherent and gripping movie. And with a running time of 2.5 hours, it's remarkable that it never once drags or lingers on unnecessary scenes to reach the conclusion.<br /><br />For fans of Memento, it will seem like that film was just Nolan was warming up to getting Inception just right. Roger Ebert made an interesting observation when he said it's a film that defies spoilers, in that even if you know the ending, it's meaningless without knowing how you got there. For film-buffs and screenplay enthusiasts, the richness of the dream-within-a-dream reality and the effortless jumping between different timelines and dreamers' worlds will be studied for years. And even though the film happens primarily in dreams, Nolan avoids the temptation to use the weirdness of the the dream world just to show us something different that ultimately doesn't make sense.<br /><br />And yet despite the tight plotting, fastidious direction and pitch-perfect score from Hans Zimmer, it's the performances of a flawless cast that pulls the whole thing together. Leonardo DiCaprio once again shows us he's one of the finest actors working today, and any one of the supporting cast creates an Oscar-worthy performance. Amongst a remarkable cast, the real star is Marion Cotillard who, in playing the subconscious projection of Leonardo's deceased wife, is both warm and completely terrifying, and grounds the challenges of the hero to chilling effect. She provides the darkness of the theme in the same convincing way that Heath Ledger epitomized the black undertones of The Dark Knight.<br /><br />With Inception, Christopher Nolan underscores himself as one of the best Writer/Directors in Hollywood, and continues to develop not only his own storytelling but the capabilities of his crew, many of whom we've seen in previous films. I don't think you'll see a better film this year, and seeing this was the first time in a long time I walked out of the movie theater thoroughly entertained, intrigued and inspired.nd dreamers' worlds will be studied for years.

Bruno is lonely in his new home - there are no other young children.  On the other side of the barbed wire his new friend, Shmuel, has the opportunity to play with the other workers.<br /><br />We see the horror as Bruno's mother (played by Vera Farmiga) realizes that dear old Dad is the kommandant of a Death Camp rather than a work camp.

But what is even more impressive is that Kelis makes sure to not get lost in this genre of music. Her vocals are just as powerful, making it a perfect blend. These songs should be getting more exposure. Flesh tone=masterpiece.
0439023483|5.0|I did my best to go into this book knowing nothing about it's content. I haven't involuntarily talked out loud to a book before The Hunger Games.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I had heard several people talking about this show.  I wasn't to sure at first, it dealt with drugs, violence all the things that really don't draw me to a show.

I love that this is available to watch on cable without subscribing to some movie channel, I will be picking up Season 2 shortly to get all caught up.<br /><br />On the downside one of the shows in Season 1 did drag a little, I think it was episode 4 somewhere in the middle, but it was necessary to tell the story. Don't be afraid of the drug theme of this show, it doesn't all have to do with that, so much more is involved.

0440242401|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and at first I wasn't sure I would.  I love the Shopaholic series and this was the first stand alone novel by Kinsella that I picked up.  (I had previously read one written under her Wickham name that I didn't enjoy quite as much).  This story follows Lexi Smart - a plain jane with crooked teeth and frizzy hair, who was cheated out of her yearly bonus by 1 week and was just stood up by her boyfriend \\"Loser Dave\\" the night before her father's funeral.<br /><br />Fast forward 3 years later, she wakes up in a hospital bed after a car accident and remembers nothing about the past few years of her life.  Suddenly, she has silky hair, straight teeth, a limber body, a new set of friends, a gorgeous husband and a posh penthouse loft... the only problem is that she doesn't remember any of it or how she got to where she is now.<br /><br />As she tries to settle back into her new fabulous life, she realizes it's not all it's cracked up to be.  Her best friends don't like her anymore, her mother is keeping secrets from her, her sister has changed dramatically, and her wonderful-perfect married life may not be all that it seems at first glance.<br /><br />This book kept me intrigued.  It was light and fun, but also a little more serious than the Shopaholic books.  Lexie faces real problems with her relationships and her work life.  Once again, I thoroughly enjoyed how Kinsella was able to bring these characters alive with dialogue.  This novel makes an excellent summer read - not too heavy, not too fluffy.  Kinsella is fast working her way to being one of my favorite authors when I want to read something light and fun!
B002UXRGLG|5.0|If I could, I would have given 'Life' a rating of 4.5 stars.     It's not quite on the same level as [[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth]] and [[ASIN:B001957A4E Blue Planet]], IMO.   It does not have the breadth of these two documentaries, nor does it have the deep focus of [[ASIN:B001W79MRW Nature's Most Amazing Events]].     The material in 'Life' tends to be more on the sensational side, presenting viewers with mostly curious animal behaviors and survival tactics.   Maybe BBC felt that they needed to reach a broader audience.     Overall, still a very high-quality documentary though.   Very interesting to watch and the footage is as phenomenal as we've come to expect from BBC nature documentaries.   I was particularly impressed with the time-lapse photography in the Plants episode.

This movie did surprise me though it had alot of action in it and wasn't corny and geeky like i thought it was going to be. I think it was the best movie of 09' and if you haven't seen it you should because it's worth the 2hrs.

B003EV6DBM|4.0|Love it, and this coming from an early 20 yr old who isn't into sci fi. Yet I got hooked on this new series as I'd step through the room where my father watches the show. Now, I've never seen the original series, and the only thing that is an \\"old version\\" that I've seen is the movie fox did, and I liked that too.   This series is fresh mostly because its a fantasy adventure that doesn't take itself seriously. Writers have the stories and characters poke fun at the absurdity of the sci fi universe and that is what makes it so fun. The stories are stupid, but the style of delivery is comical and the actors/actress are humorous which makes the show so entertaining. It feels fresh because if you compare it to the style of shows which dominate US airwaves, (CSI, Law & Order, NCIS, Cold Case, Bones) all these murder shows that are soooo repetitive and predictable, Doctor Who feels so original.   It is a stupid show, but everyone involved knows it and uses that to their advantage of creating an entertaining fantasy world of far fetched crisis with humorous characters.  Series 5 is not as good as 3 or 4 due to Amy Pond who is very dependent on The Doctor. I like companions like Martha Jones and Donna because they are able to competently handle themselves in dire situations, and when they're left without The Doctor, those companions knew what to do. Amy Pond is very much like Rose frm series 1 and 2, Pond is funny but such a drag because she can't really do anything without The Doctor telling her what to do.   Matt Smith is brilliant and a perfect replacement for Tenet, and I look forward to Smith to remain as The Doctor for as long as possible. Now the finale for this series is not as good as the past 4 were because the end event is not as dangerous for the world, but its still captivating. The best aspects to this series was the pilot and seeing the new Doctor for the first time in action and witnessing him regenerate with a very intriguing personality. The return of theWeeping Angels along with Riverssong was great, and the writers seem to be hinting a stronger arc w/ her in it. I personally am keeping my fingers crossed for Riversong to be The Doctor's next companion, she's competent, witty, smart, and keeps The Doctor in line, the perfect woman.   Love this series and Matt Smith is a godsend as the new Doctor.
0805091742|5.0|Atul Gawande has succinctly described the usage of checklists in different scenarios and how they help cope with the complexities in different areas involved in our day to day lives. Starting with Aviation which has pioneered the concept of a checklist as far back as the early twentieth century to help fly the then complex fighter aircraft B17 which was nicknamed the \\"flying fortress\\". A disaster, resulting from a pilot error due to a missed procedural step, on the first flight, led to the origination of a checklist. Since then all pilots, starting from the lowest 2 seater aircraft to the lofty space shuttle, are trained to use checklists to start an engine, taxi,  take off, cruise, land, shut off the engine, and deal with any emergency encountered.     Chefs at famous restaurants routinely use recipes, which are a form of a checklist, to get the dish consistently right each time. It does not mean that a checklist is a static piece engraved in stone. It can be updated to reflect improvements. Gawande describes the crash of a British Airways Boeing 777 flight in January 2008. Flying over the North pole from Beijing into London, both of its engines lost power and crashed just a couple of miles short of the runway. The cause was speculated to be formation of ice crystals in the fuel lines. A recommendation was made to reduce the power for a few seconds in such cases, instead of increasing it, to reduce fuel and ice crystals in the fuel lines. This gives a chance for the heat exchanger to kick in and melt the ice crystals. The improved check list saved the day later that year for a Delta Airlines polar flight from Shanghai to Atlanta. Ice crystals formed in the Boeing 777 fuel lines while flying over Montana. The pilots reduced the power for a while and then increased it to recover the engines.     Checklists are used in cases where a  lot of specialists are involved in executing numerous steps correctly to create an end product.  An example is the construction industry. Master builders had built the famous buildings in the past like the Notre Dame and the US Capitol. Contemporary skyscrapers are so complex and involve so many specialities that the master builder has become an extinct specie. Better co-ordination and tracking thru checklists are the hallmarks of the construction industry which has become pretty efficient.     I was surprised to read Gawande mention that health care professionals do not use a checklist to deal with thousands of different procedures. Since I come from an Information Technology background, where checklists are commonly used, though not as often as in Aviation, I was ground in the checklist tradition arising out of my passion for flying small planes. By the same token, it is not surprising given that thehealth care field scores very low in the usage of Information Technology. Much of the records are paper based which contribute to low productivity, human errors, and high costs.     The crux of the book is the documentation by  Gawande of an important case study undertaken for WHO to introduce the usage of a checklist in surgeries across 8 different hospitals in different parts of the world. In all the cases, there was significant improvement in the quality of the surgical procedures,  drastic reduction in human errors and the resulting fatalities. The most common problem before the introduction of the checklist was the infection of lines in Intensive Care Units. Infections also resulted from doctors not washing their hands periodically, although this has been emphasized more than 150 years ago by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis.  Gawande wrote extensively about this problem in his earlier book \\"Better\\". This case study led to the acceptance of checklists by the hospitals.    This book concludes with the idea that checklists are making inroads into hospitals and are significantly bettering the outcomes of thousands of medical procedures performed every day.
B0030U1TLQ|3.0|Granted, I did listen to this for two weeks straight after it arrived, but mostly because I wanted to hear the studio album again and again. The extras and live cd were a bit disappointing I have to say. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I guess I was expecting something I'd never heard before. Since I already owned \\"Entreat\\" as an import that I bought in 1990, I can't really say I heard much new here.
0439023483|4.0|I've been hearing many good things about The Hunger Games so I decided to have a look, and after a couple of days I couldn't put it down. This dystopian thriller about a group of teenagers battling to the death in an arena where there is only one victor was tense enough until I realized I was reading about my very own worst nightmare. Honestly. Being trapped in an enclosed space and having to kill or be killed with random painful weapons has been a recurring dream of mine since childhood.<br /><br />It's a good thing that memory didn't keep me from enjoying the story which is well constructed with good character development. This is the first book in a three-part series and I'm looking forward to finding out what eventually happens to Katniss Everdeen and company.
B003K025V4|5.0|Can't Be Tamed is a great CD by Miley Cyrus. It is fun and full of energy and also has some nice slower songs. After I first played it, I loved it. And now I can't be tamed to stop listening to it. All 12 songs are good but my favorites are \\"Liberty Walks\\", \\"Permanent December\\", \\"Forgiveness and Love\\" and especially \\"My Heart Beats For Love\\". I think My Heart could definitely be a single. It is a slower but beautiful song that I have listened to again and again.<br />I never listened much to her earlier songs as Hannah Montana, but I think by the sound of this CD, she has definitely grown up and apart from that character to just be herself. I do like the song \\"The Climb\\" from the movie. She is very good at singing ballads.<br />This is her first effort as herself and not Hannah and it is a solid one. Look forward to her next one in the future.
0061998494|5.0|This hobo stopped in for a chicken dinner, but stayed to read \\"American on Purpose: The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Patriot\\" by Craig Ferguson, host of The Late Late Show.<br /><br />Hobo? Chicken dinner? Just a couple of things Craig tosses about on his show. I watch his show fairly often. I am a late night person and want something to occupy my mind while I sew. Dave and Craig and Jerry are my entertainers. For a good while I've been convinced that Craig ad libs his monologue. His book puts that question to rest: He does. It puts to rest a number of other thoughts I've had about Craig.<br /><br />He is much more accomplished than I thought. Who is this Craig Ferguson who became host on a late night show in America? How did he get the job? Not that I had any idea or interest in the others. I like this guy with the attractive accent dressed in an attractive, mischievous, flirtatious, sometimes repulsive and annoying demeanor. But he's nearly always entertaining.<br /><br />I don't often read memoirs or biographies, but thoroughly enjoyed this one. I don't even remember why I ordered the book. I can say, however, that he writes the most eloquent chapter about what it is to be American and why he became American. He's most assuredly worth quoting: Interesting. I cannot find a single sentence I want to quote out of context. It's the context that makes his praise of becoming American so touching, while simultaneously recognizing and appreciating his Scottish roots.<br /><br />One thing he thanks America for is a second chance at becoming more than a failure, as he deems himself for so many years, first in Scotland, then in America. Alcohol and drugs made him a rotten stink of a man on many occasions. However, this book becomes a rousing story of overcoming the odds of addiction and is worth promoting on that basis alone.<br /><br />He rarely unfairly treats anyone. He speaks ill of only a handful of people, but has the decency not to name them. To the women he loved, he is uncompromisingly appreciative and kind, behavior refreshingly welcome and surprising in a memoir.<br /><br />The book is so well-written (I don't mean a literary classic) that I wondered if it was ghosted or co-\\"written,\\" but discovered he has also written a novel. A person who can write a novel can write his own memoir. Nothing should be surprising about this man's vast pool of talent or unrelenting need to work and create.<br /><br />If you know nothing about Craig Ferguson, look at the picture on the cover of his book. That quirkiness pretty much sums up his personality and the rare treat you will get for reading \\"American on Purpose.\\"<br /><br />(Note: Be forewarned that he sprinkles the f-bomb throughout, enough to notice but not so much that the reader wants to toss the book in the trash.)tive and kind, behavior refreshingly welcome and surprising in a memoir.

0307454541|5.0|I read many of the other reviews before I purchased the book and was a bit concerned after hearing about exausting detail, violence against women etc.  BUT, while there is some kind of graphic and gross accounts in the book (it is a crime mystery after all) I didn't find it to be overly graphic or disturbing.  I also did not find the writing to be overly detailed, in fact, I thought it was an extremely well planned and executed book.  The writing was brilliant and I was sucked in from page 1, it stayed interesting all the way through and all the way to the end.  I liked the characters and really enjoyed that it was set in a country I know little about.  This just made it more unique.  Over all its awesome and I'm allready loaning it to someone to read.  I hope she enjoys it the way I did and yes, I'll be picking up the next in the series tonight!

I wish this was around when I went to elementary school. This is the kind of book that really gets your imagination spinning.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is a 12 yr. old that discovers his chaotic dyslectic life is influenced by his tie-ins to the Greek Gods.

1932907009|4.0|To those other reviewers that complain about the scripts this author has sold and/or had made into films, they have a point. Both of his produced movies seem to be instantly forgettable. However, it is a fact in life that those who do a thing best are not necessarily the same as those who teach it best. I have seen that principle made flesh in hundreds of different ways.    Save the Cat is not as shimmeringly brilliant as some claim it is, but it isn't half bad either, and certainly not as bad as some claim it is. There is a lot of sound advice here, even if much of it has existed in previous forms elsewhere. Snyder's main success is to boil a very tricky and subtle process down to something that can be digested and thus internalized.    But that is probably also its risk. As others have pointed out, this tendency towards reduction drives the advice given in the direction of formula. In my opinion (not being an expert however) this is the one area of Blake Snyder's advice you would do well to treat with some skepticism, especially (and surprisingly) since he drops hints that he wants you to follow his \\"cheat sheet\\" more or less to the letter (i.e. to the page number).    My suspicion would be that seasoned script readers in Hollywood can \\"smell\\" any script that has emerged as the output of any individual's formulaic \\"method\\" a mile away, and in that scent they can probably even discern fairly quickly which method or which guru it is. Such a script is likely to describe a short throwing arc into the trash can.    These cautions aside though, Save the Cat has a lot of helpful advice, especially when combined with a number of other books that do what this one does not, and which travel deeper into story. It certainly is not the last book on screenwriting you will ever need. It's probably better if it is your first, learn his rules, and then be prepared to break them, or at least bend them.

0385732554|3.0|The Giver is like a cross between Brave New World, 1984 and Logan's Run. The concept of dystopia is not original, but Lowry adds her own interesting twist via the society's overall structure, as well as the concepts of a Giver of Memory and Receiver of Memory. Lowry builds the story nicely, slowly unveiling the twisted nature of the society in a way that maintains suspense until the very last page.<br /><br />However, there were important elements that I felt were unexplained or poorly developed.<br /><br />-Spoilers!-<br /><br />1) Receivers store memories from individuals throughout human history, but do those \\"memories\\" include the experiences of people who are currently living? How else did the Giver have the sled memory that he trasmitted to Jonas, which ended being the EXACT sled Jonas rode at the end? It wasn't a random memory of a sled from hundreds of years ago. It was the SAME sled, in the SAME location (this is made clear when Jonas recognizes the hill and knows exactly where the sled will be). Obviously Givers and Receivers have some psychic abilities, but the sled memory was made to sound like something from the past, not a future projection. So what was the sled ride memory then? A future vision? A memory from a currently living person? What?<br /><br />3) Once Jonas escaped with Gabe, how was the Giver planning to release memories to the entire community? It sounded like only a rare person had the ability to receive memories and yet, when a Receiver dies, somehow the memories end up dispersed to the whole community. How on earth does that work?<br /><br />4) Was the Giver planning to kill himself in order to release all his memories to the community? If he could release the memories by choice and give them to whomever he wanted, then why go through the agonizing process of finding a Receiver who appears to posses the psychic ability to \\"see beyond\\" (as it's described in the book) since apparently anyone could be a Receiver. Obviously they want someone with the emotional capability to be the Receiver, but there was certainly no need to find a child who could \\"see beyond.\\"<br /><br />5) Making oneself cold - as Jonas did to himself and Gabe to mask their various locations when the planes with infared heat sensors were searching for them - does NOT mask the heat from an entire body. Unless you're dead, it doesn't matter how cold you are, your core still produces heat and a heat sensor will detect it.<br /><br />However, although I felt that it was missing some important background development, the story itself was intriguing and worth a read for the themes it explores, chief among them being freedom and individuality.e the Receiver, but there was certainly no need to find a child who could \\"see beyond.\\"    5) Making oneself cold - as Jonas did to himself and Gabe to mask their various locations when the planes with infared heat sensors were searching for them - does NOT mask the heat from an entire body.

0156421178|5.0|This small book was decades ahead of its time.  The internecine warfare Orwell documents reads more like a description of the Vietnam War than the Second World War that followed.      What might have appeared to be a war of all against Franco and, more important, a war to stop what was perceived as a tidal wave of fascism engulfing Europe became, in fact, a political war of various coalitions against other coalitions, ultimately to the detriment of Orwell's own division.      Also, note how remarkably cautious Orwell is when describing events; how carefully he reminds readers of the limitations of his vantage point, of the fact that his experience may well be idiosyncratic --  not representative of the totality of the complicated war he is documenting.  When is the last time any you remember hearing a journalist express that level of humility?
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I was really starting to enjoy this series, then ABC decided the ratings weren't good enough. I don't know how networks expect us to stay with them when they can't commit to completing a story once they've started it. The ratings were better than many shows on cable.

For instance, on Fire and Rain, the capo is on the 3rd fret, and the first notes are 3 on the 5th string and 7 sliding to 9 on the 3rd string.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|As someone who's been a fan since the beginning, I can say with certainty that a season of \\"Dexter\\" is only as good as it's villian. Since I found Jimmy Smitts' DA character in Season 3 to be the weakest villian so far, I was thrilled that Season 4 bounced back with it's best villian yet - John Lithgow's \\"Trinity killer\\".<br /><br />Actually, referring to each season's central antagonist as a \\"villian\\" isn't really accurate. Each season of Dexter revolves around a central relationship. At Dexter's core, he is looking for someone who he can be his true, complete self with. Someone who will accept him and understand him for who he is. In Season 1, this character took the form of a brother, in Season 2, a lover, and in Season 3, a friend. Sadly and ironically, finding these \\"genuine\\" connections almost always ends up threatening Dexter's \\"fake\\" life, and, so far, Dexter always chooses to save his \\"fake\\" life instead of pursuing honest relationships with the bloodthirsty soulmates who truly understand him.<br /><br />In Season 4, this central relationship takes the form of a father figure and mentor, played by the superb John Lithgow. What makes the season so mesmerizing is that, maybe for the first time, Michael C. hall, who is a fantastic actor, is paired with an actor who can really match his acting chops. The two have terrific chemistry, and to watch the two characters slowly chip away at each other's carefully constructed facades over the course of the season is thrilling. I have to say, that before the final scene of the season's last episode, I was finding myself a little disappointed that the show seemed to be ending its season in it's usual way, until ... BAM! The final scene that set the internet and fans on fire.<br /><br />The show's weakness has always been its supporting characters, whose storylines never live up to Dexter's in terms of being engrossing or entertaining. I've always liked the Deborah character, and I prefer seeing her paired with partner Quinn rather than with the late Doakes (was it just me, or did that actor only ever have one expression?). But her rekindled romance with Lundy was a boring subplot, and Quinn's love affair with Trinity's daughter was only slightly more interesting. In addition, I find both of the actors who play Angel and Laguerta to be charming, but putting them together into a forbidden office romance added nothing to the season.<br /><br />The season belonged to John Lithgow, and, of course, the final shocking twist. Regarding the former, I don't see how the show could possibly surpass this season's central nemesis, but regarding the later, season 5 will definitely see Dexter's life shaken up!late Doakes (was it just me, or did that actor only ever have one expression?).

0434019259|5.0|I was introduced to Winslow with the Dawn Patrol, (another 5 star effort) and afterward proceeded to systematically read each one of his novels. Winslow's range is absolutely amazing. The plots are greatly entertaining and clearly, the subjects are well researched. The writing is superb.  This is a sequel to the Dawn Patrol, and it follows a born surfer, ex-cop, become private eye and an eclectic group of surfer buddies in San Diego. Out of work, for some time he suddenly lands a matrimonial case that spirals into something larger that he could have ever envisioned. No more spoilers. I could not put this book down.  One thing that never ceases to surprise me is that although two of his novels have been purchased to be taken to the screen (one completed, the second - \\"The Winter of Frankie Machine\\" was purchased for Robert De Niro to play lead role), I have yet to meet someone who has heard of Winslow or read his books. Do yourself a favor and get acquainted with Winslow today.
B003NFM3KE|2.0|I always buy, what I think are special movies, in BluRay.  I would like it in 3D but this is only offered in 2D.  You have to buy the other set with theater type 3D plus new equipment to see it in 3D.  I think that is a rip.  Companies are always pushing new technology onto the public before their current technology is worn out.  In this economy who has 3 to 4 thousand dollars to upgrade their equipment when they already have BluRay and HD hardware.  Rich people I suppose.  With a large chunk of the country out of work who do they think can buy the new hardware.  The price of the BluRay sets aren't that much different but is the cost of the hardware for the BluRay 3D set that makes it impossible.  I don't know who to fault for this, Disney, or the companies making the special 3D hardware.  I don't think this is going to be a profit maker for anyone.  They should transition by offering a regular 3D in the set too for those of us that can't afford new and expensive 3D equipment.  I would rate the movie itself 5 stars but I rated the BluRays low becuae they don't consider the common consumer with limited funds.

B000059H9E|4.0|A maturing Almodovar in a less absurd - if still melodramatic - mode than his early films.  This time the tone is more film noir/mystery/character study.  Unlike most of the early work, this is generally `serious', with just touches of his humor.  Visually very striking and dark.  Wonderful performances, including an early one by Javier Bardem.<br /><br />I appreciate how all the characters are grey, no one is `good' or bad'.  Basically it's a love triangle with multiple angles, and a cop drama about violence and love.  What it's missing (for me at least) , and keeps it a very good film, not a great one, is deeper levels of emotion.  It's always interesting, but I didn't ultimately find it affecting.  Also a couple of key plot contrivances are clunky - which the anarchic young Almodovar could get away with, since everything was absurd anyway.  But when you're being more `real', forced twists feel more... well, forced.  Still a highly enjoyable film well worth seeing, and another important step in the growth of a major filmmaker.

B000001EKX|4.0|Update- March 18, 2014.  Alright I have no problem admitting I was a little too harsh on Hotter Than Hell the first time I listened to/reviewed it.  Things change so I'll write a better, more open-minded review.  It turns out I like Kiss way more than I originally thought.  I found this out last month when I re-listened to all their 70's albums.  They're still on the generic side- I have to stand by that.  But that doesn't mean the band can't crank out some quality tunes once in a while (especially during the 70's when they were much more consistent and rocked harder).<br /><br />\\"Got to Choose\\" opens this album.  Not a song I'd ever place on a list of favorite Kiss songs and I feel it's somewhat weak as an opener, but I suppose the \\"Who's your baby\\" part is alright.  This song has the potential to grow on me over time.  In fact it's growing on me now!  \\"Parasite\\" has a really appealing gritty guitar riff, and it's MUCH heavier than most of Kiss material.  I love the chorus \\"Parasite lady, parasite eyes!\\"  The guitar solo really tears in an awesome and melodic kind of way too.  \\"Goin' Blind\\" is some kind of ballad anthem.  Reminds me of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" a little bit in the atmosphere and approach (the two vocal melodies are completely different of course).  This song is a highlight.  The guitar tricks during the chorus are cool.<br /><br />The title song is next.  It's a nice mid tempo glam rocker.  I don't mind the verse melody but the chorus really doesn't appeal to me at all because of how lazily written it sounds.  The soaring guitar solo is a pleasant thrilling surprise at the end, at least.  \\"Let Me Go, Rock & Roll\\" is a fast-paced, 50's-style rock and roll aggressive tune.  This song is more up my alley.  I like when hard rock bands write music in this style especially rock artists from the 60's and 70's because you know they're really trying to make it a believable throwback to an era long gone.  \\"All the Way\\" is more mid tempo glam rock.  Nothing particularly special (I can think of a bunch of rock artists at the time who'd be able to run circles around this song in the glam rock department) but it's alright.  The guitar solo is definitely awesome, though.  It's too short however.  I am beginning to warm up to the chorus \\"And you just keep talkin' louder, complain to your mother and father, one of these days you'll push me all the way!\\"<br /><br />\\"Watchin' You\\" is based around a VERY heavy guitar riff!  Really deep and smokin' vocals too.  This song is really cool, especially the verse melody.  It sort of loses steam during the chorus which is often times a problem with Kiss music (the chorus doesn't live up to the verse and feels out of place).  The guitar work during the solo is REALLY amazing, thankfully.  \\"Mainline\\" is another high point.  The chorus is especially the most appealing factor. \\"Mainline, baby won't you give it to me one time\\".  \\"Comin' Home\\" has an upbeat guitar riff.  The song needs to be longer to give me a better impression of it however.  \\"Strange Ways\\" is excellent for the really heavy guitar riff and cool verse melody.  This song might be my favorite song on the album.  It's THAT good!  Vocals sort of remind me of the lead singer of Golden Earring too, surprisingly enough.<br /><br />As weird as this sounds, I think the reason I can't quite get into this album compared to other Kiss albums is due to the title- Hotter Than Hell.  With such a frightening and intimidating title, you'd think the music would be REALLY good but for the most part it's just mid tempo, enjoyable rock music.  Of course there's more taking place than just the album title obviously- the music should always be taken into consideration first and it does and... it's definitely good music.  Better than I originally gave it credit for, in fact.  I dunno, it's just not the one Kiss album I'd recommend first.<br /><br />Here's my older review.  Don't take it seriously- it's old for a reason.  My feelings have changed more positively.  I was definitely in an angry mood when I wrote it.  Here it is:<br /><br />Kiss is quite possibly the worst commercial rock band of all-time when we think about negative influences.  Even as far back as 1974 and their Hotter Than Hell album, Kiss is responsible for influencing the power ballad/hair metal movement that sparked the likes of Bon Jovi, Twisted Sister, Motley Crue, and several other cheesy, secondrate rock artists.  These are the artists that people like to point out destroyed the spirit of rock and roll and sucked the originality right out of the entire genre, but actually it was Kiss who started the dumbing down process of rock and roll, so they definitely get most of the blame from my point of view.<br /><br />Just listen to Hotter Than Hell if you don't believe me.  \\"Got to Choose\\" features a really lame verse melody, and an obnoxiously simplistic chorus.  Everything about Kiss is so unbelievably simple that my IQ level goes down just THINKING about their music.<br /><br />If someone were to tell me Kiss didn't influence the bands I mention above, I simply wouldn't believe them.  This is because the majority of this album (and every other Kiss album from the 70's) is nearly identical to a typical generic mid 80's hair metal tune.<br /><br />For that, sure, Kiss is definitely an influence on the heavy metal style that took place in the near future, but trust me on this one- it was a *very* bad influence.  We're still hearing that influence to this very day, in fact.  Just listen to the new Ozzy Osbourne album titled Scream if you don't believe me.<br /><br />Sometimes Kiss lets completely loose and manages to entertain me with a passable rock song, such as the heavy riffs and screamer vocals included on a track like \\"Parasite\\".  Kiss should have kept their music going in THIS direction 100% of the time, because by the end of the album, you hear a song like \\"Mainline\\" and experience the Bon Jovi-like mid-tempo corniness all overagain.<br /><br />Skip this one folks.  I mean the entire band, not just the album.  There's a reason Kiss is one of the worst rock bands from the 70's, and this album is solid proof of that.  I'll be nice and give the album a 3 star rating because whenever a song like \\"Parasite\\" appears, the band is actually pretty good.  Enjoy those brief moments while they last however, because sooner rather than later, they'll be right back into generic cheeseball mode for your displeasure all over again.<br /><br />Remember Kiss for their live performances and *not* for the quality of their songwriting, which is weaker than anything else from the 70's.  I guarantee it.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I never knew that this show was to replace LOST.... I liked LOST, but for most of the entire show I was LOST.... it was very confusing.... almost to the point of losing interest because I could not follow it. I even rented Netflix DVD's to see it all again and still never quite got it.  Anyway... FLASHFORWARD.... I like it... It's different. I get fed up with all the detective programs. If anyone used to watch JERICHO.... that was good show too, it got taken off, but put back on for another season, where they ended it very strange like. How come programs that are being watched and popular by all accounts, shows that shove gay crap in front of you. There should be a gay channel for people that want to watch gay crap. I stop watching shows that have that crap, and there are many anymore. I do not appreciate having my kids watching TV and having 2 grown guys laying one on each other. And now lesbians are getting in on the game. Even FLASHFOWARD if I remember correctly has a lesbian couple in it. WHY?????????????? It is not necessary.......... How many people in their daily lives come across lesbo's or fags laying one on each other. Make your own shows, get your own channel to air your perverse way of life and leave the normal channels alone.... Keep Flashforward on if you like.... but I won't lose sleep if its taken off.........
B000006UNF|5.0|So here I am once more...    These haunting lyrics are the start of an amazing lyrical and musical journey which any Prog Rock fan should embark on. In the 26 years since I first heard to his amazing album, I still love to listen to it.
030726999X|5.0|I absolutely loved the series and read each book in about one day. The second book was probably my favorite because of the action and suspense, but the others were very good also. I highly recommend this series to all of my friends and family!
0316779237|3.0|Holidays on Ice was really a slight waste of time for me. Again, Sedaris set the bar SO high with his previous publications that anything else will simply not do. I forced myself to finish this and did so with barely a chuckle. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for Mr. Sedaris, but his missed the mark on this one. But just a wee bit. If you're a Sedaris fan, by all means, read this book. Just don't expect too much.
B00000768B|4.0|Alright, I can definitely see why so many people have a problem with this album.   It contains a bunch of *extremely* fruity, severely dated throwaway filler tracks.  But the thing is (and this is a BIG DEAL in my mind) this little collection of pop songs is amazingly *diverse*.  When listening to this album, you will immediately notice that each track sounds much different from the previous one.      Diversity is pretty important in my world, especially when it comes to pop music.  Diversity helps you appreciate each track individually.  Yes I know, what I'm saying here sounds really fruity (much like the music itself) but it's true!    In addition to that, Ring Ring also happens to be one of those rare occasions where I find the tracks on the second side stronger than the first.  This VERY rarely happens.  Like, the odds of me preferring side 2 over side 1 happens once out of every 50 albums.  I like the unpredictability factor there, hehe.    Anyway, the title song is a catchy, upbeat pop song.  I like it, especially the rhythm.  My favorite songs however, are the ones that sound like straight pop songs in the same style as say... oh I don't know... not quite the Beatles I suppose, but maybe the Zombies or Paul Revere and the Raiders.      These songs are \\"She's My Kind of Girl\\", \\"Another Town, Another Train\\", \\"Nina, Pretty Ballerina\\", \\"He Is Your Brother\\", and \\"Love Isn't Easy\\".  I LOVE these songs, hence my 4 star rating.    Other songs are satisfactory as well, such as the dramatic ballad \\"Disillusion\\" and the atmospheric style of \\"I Saw It in the Mirror\\".      I can definitely do without \\"People Need Love\\".  I don't like that one, haha.  Other than that, this qualifies as a really good pop album.  Oh sure, hearing this album repeatedly in one sitting would drive any sane person up the wall, but it's not like you'd listen to any other Abba album repeatedly either... or would you?

B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this book. The first time I picked it up to read it I just couldn't get into it, but just give it a second try and you will see that it really is a fantastic book (and a fantastic series). The second book was my favorite and the third was my least favorite of the three (still good though)<br />Great translated series by this author. Too bad there aren't more in English!
0316776963|4.0|While \\"Me Talk...\\" is no \\"Naked\\", it still hits a solid home run in the humor department. You won't find yourself rolling on the ground with laughter like you did with \\"Naked\\", but you'll certainly turn many heads with your belly laughs while reading this book in public. If you're looking for another funny read by Mr. Sedaris, pick up this book and you won't be disappointed.
0446364495|5.0|'The Bridges of Madison County' is well worth the read. A wisp of smoke this one. Simple without being simplistic. I cried, and I've seen the movie! - I knew how it would end.<br /><br />From the first lines I was captivated:<br /><br />'There are songs that come free from the blue-eyed grass, from the dust of a thousand country roads. This is one of them.'<br /><br />Such featherlight poetry! I didn't expect this at all when I signed up to read Bridges. I knew it would be a passionate, torrid affair that spanned four days. But the passion in the prose! The straightforward yet poetic nature of the story. A single, clashing love caught in four days?<br /><br />Waller manages it, without slipping into `telling.' He weaves between the viewpoint of quiet, confident National Geographic writer-photographer Robert Kincaid as he arrives in the south Iowa countryside in 1965 in his old Chevrolet pick-up truck, and the bold but unremarkable farm-wife (and Italian war bride) Francesca Johnson, who falls deeply in love with Robert while her husband and children are away at the Iowa State Fair.<br /><br />The Madison County setting with its rustic bridges adds to the romance in this novel. I remember hearing about it as a child, but in those days I believed `literature' meant boring. If the lit critics were raving over The Bridges of Madison County, and the women were swooning over it, it must either be stuffy or cheap.<br /><br />Neither! So much life in this one. What I appreciated most about the novel was the gentleness with which Waller penned it. He could have gone high-drama and excessive romanticism. Instead he opted for sincerity in dialogue and quiet elegance. A true and honest love story told frankly, sensually, tragically. An intense affair coupled with tender conversation and honest emotion. An entire life lived in four days; a story framed in the early 1990s and told through Francesca's children, her letters, journals, photographs - and of course, Robert and Francesca.<br /><br />Highly recommended. It's a summer night in a rain shower.n a rain shower.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I love this show because it made you think and isn't just a look at and drool show. I recommend it to people who like Sci-fi. I was a bit hard to follow in the first few episodes, but once you get past them, they are easy to follow. The actors were wonderful and I like that it has 5 or 6 stories inside the big story. There was so much to this show. I am sure dissapointed that it was canceled.
9889979942|5.0|What a fantastic journey and amazing collection of photography!  This book is a thoroughly enjoyable look into a beautiful culture, land, and people that most of us have had minimal exposure to.  The dedication the author must have applied in traveling through the vast expanse of the country, not to mention the inaccessibility of many areas is simply incredible.  In addition to the obvious talent and creativity involved in imagining and executing the various shots, I'm also impressed by the author's success in getting such a wide variety of subjects to allow him to do his work.  Some of my favorites were the Gegentala cowboy and wrestler, and the Shanghai grannies.  The architecture is amazing - the Macau stands out as a great example.  I also enjoyed seeing the stunning color and contrasts of the landscapes and weather - the Longji Titian and Bamboo Sea photos are particularly memorable.  The narratives for each section and captions on each page were very well written and contribute an important and deeper understanding of the author's experience.  Overall, I found this book very inspiring and would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to China and even moreso to those who've never considered it.  You will want to go meet all of these people yourself!

1453693319|4.0|\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"<br /><br />I'm going to be honest. This novel didn't get interesting to me until page 202. If you look above at the total page number, you'll see this is WELL into the novel.<br /><br />I didn't feel any tension? Any real conflict?<br /><br />So there's a woman living in a house with her parents (both of whom are pretty kooky, though Mama Bennet takes the cake) and four sisters (only one of whom seems remotely redeemable.) They talk, they walk, they go to parties, they get interested in marriage then get dumped, then someone else wants to marry one of them but moves away, more parties, some sewing, some cards, yada yada yada.<br /><br />I read this novel searching for WHAT in the world it is people like about it.<br /><br />Then it hit me: the tension is the life depicted.<br /><br />Jane Austen was living this life-an exceedingly intelligent woman (evidenced by her prose) who is made to reside behind doors hoping a man will marry her and hoping he is someone she'll respect.<br /><br />An insipid existence. A passive life for an active mind.<br /><br />The conflict isn't within the characters. The conflict is between the author and her readers.<br /><br />So how does Austen portray the absurdity of her life without alienating her readers? She creates an intelligent woman and then contrasts her with absurd characters. She gives us Jane, a sweet woman who is considered beautiful by everyone (though her mind is given no notice.) She gives us Elizabeth, a smart girl who is forever compared to her socially perfect sister. She gives us a mother who wants nothing but five sons-in-law, a father who can barely stand the presence of any of these women (or their prospective boyfriends), and a trio of silly sisters either buried in books or the mirror. Their ultimate life goal? Marriage.<br /><br />Having no money makes acheiving this goal very difficult.<br /><br />Wanting love? Equality? Conversation that isn't empty? Nearly impossible.<br /><br />Along comes cranky but rich Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Somehow Austen has to find a way to make the rich guy see the poor woman's intelligence, and the poor woman see the rich (arrogant) guy's shrewdness.<br /><br />Both of them are trapped in an absurd game. Both of them know it's an absurd game but neither of them can say it's absurd, and Austen daren't let on she knows it's absurd because everyone buying the book is trapped in the very same game.<br /><br />She displays her novel as a light-hearted love story. In truth, I think it's a firestorm. She's shouting, as loud as she dares, \\"Does anyone else think this is stupid?\\"<br /><br />If you're reading for entertainment, it starts around 202. If you're reading to see Victorian society laid out on a surgical table and diced with style, it starts at page 1.<br /><br />4/5 for Pride and Prejudice.><br />Wanting love? Equality?

031236198X|4.0|Adulthood oftentimes involves abandoning the fantastic fables that have served to form us. John Kotter revisits this \\"monstrosity of maturation\\" by emerging us in a yarn about change, group dynamics and well - life.<br /><br />We need more adult story-tellers who take us back to those methods of learning that are so powerful in our formative years.<br /><br />Perhaps, it's what we must unlearn that matters most in adulthood. Kotter points the way in this wonderful tale.
1401359418|4.0|Good Book with very good suggestions for improving your luck. The book also has various exercises in it to check your luck factor and evaluate yourself. Gives good examples of peoople with good and bad luck and why. This really is a self help book and makes you look at yourself and your attitude toward life and how to change it. It also talks about changing your personality, but I am not sure that is possible, either you are an introvert or extrovert and not sure you can do much about changing that.

1416955070|3.0|I'm sad to say that I was disappointed with this book.  It was good, and I liked it, but I was expecting to extraordinarily love it, and the sad fact of the matter is that there is really nothing extraordinary about it.<br /><br />In City of Bones, Clary, a normal girl finds herself thrown unexpectedly into the world of shadowhunters, unseen people who have dedicated their lives to hunting the evil of the world - the vampires and werewolves and other things that would prefer to kill humans than live with them.  Supposedly.<br /><br />We'll start with things I liked about the book.  Cassandra Clare has a vivid way of explaining herself and describing things.  She has an evident love of adjectives that translates well into writing (if you like to be hit in the face with clear, to the point descriptions, that is.  I guess I occasionally do).  It almost seems like she had FUN writing, and that made the reading fun.  At the same time, I occasionally felt like she was having too much fun.  There was the occasional point in which I felt like she needed to remember that she was writing for a general audience and not just her inner circle.<br /><br />And the dialogue - if there is one thing that Clare should be known for, it is her ability to write engaging, believable dialogue.  The conversations between the characters were real and emotional and, well, satisfying.  I was especially impressed with some of the conversations between Clary and Jace, a shadowhunter.  While I occasionally found the dialogue between Clary and her best human friend, Simon, to be forced and awkward, Clary and Jace had deep yet believable conversations that made me think and made me love them together.  This is a book that makes you feel like you have to pick teams, and I am totally Team Jace.  All the way.  I liked the way that she used conversation to have aspects of the Shadow world explained to Clary.  It seems like it could have been hard to bring her up to date, but I liked that most of her knowledge came through talking to Jace.  It was much more real than, say, if she had just picked up a book and suddenly known everything (this happened, too, for the record, and it sort-of rubbed me the wrong way).<br /><br />The PROBLEM with the book, though, was it's overwhelming lack of originality.  Clary, while well-developed, was a well-developed character that I have read a million times over.  And while reading through some of the situations that she managed to get herself into, I couldn't help but feel that I was reading a slightly more adult, slightly more feminine Harry Potter.<br />I'm serious.  I sometimes thought I was reading Harry Potter minus all of the characters and places that I have grown to know and love.  And as such, it was frustrating to read.  I feel like I already knew not only what was going to happen but HOW before the initial storyline was even set-up.<br />It was so derivative wasn't fresh, it wasn't unique, and as such, it wasn't engaging.  I always finish books, but if I hadn't been sitting for several hours in an airplane followed by a train followed by a bus, I think it would have been hard for me to finish this one.  Simply because it was so hard for me to care about anything happening, because it felt like a watered down version of something I'd already read a thousand times over.<br /><br />That said, I feel oddly compelled to pick up City of Ashes, the second book in the series.  And I guess that means I was slightly more engaged than I thought I was.  I'm sort of curious to see what happens between Clary and Simon and Jace.  And then there's the expectations thing - I had such HIGH expectations of this book, and I can't wonder if that plays some minor role in my disappointment.  I will start the second one with lower expectations.  I also feel that Clare has the potential to be a truly good author, and I am curious to see if she will grow is an author.king to Jace.

B003C5FMEE|2.0|Beeing a trombonist myself I was thrilled to recieve this CD with trombone pictures all over, but had to wait 5 cuts to hear the first trombone solo, and found myself liking the trumpet playing much better. The beats are all similar loud new orleans type marching beats mixed with rock or hip-hop, which I understand from this artist, but left me with a strange new genre for sure, but an odd mix of loud horn section type licks instead of intemit horn playing I was hoping for. Too many songs streched in too many directions for this listener, I'm sure the singing is fine but he's billing himself as \\"trombone shorty\\". I dont feel the artist has to depart that far from from new orleans jazz and backround roots in order to generate more rock and hiphop fans, the fans will come, sounds like more folks wanted the last naked horn cut to go longer also. I do give Andrew credit for thinking Outside the box, pursuing his vision with his bandmates, and his national touring, I'm trying to like this cd by playing more, but trombone wise it's leaving me very empty, I need more Jack Teagarden please.
0451196716|5.0|this book was received within the suggested time frame and in the condition advertised.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.  It was worth the price sent.
0399156577|4.0|I really enjoyed this latest release from Nora Roberts.  My confidence in her as a writer has been restored with this book.  I've been a fan of Ms. Roberts for over 20 years, and have found with some authors, their characters start to all sound the same.  In some of her recent releases, I felt the dialog was too close to Eve Dallas.  Eve's thinking and talking process is very unique to her character. I certainly hoped Ms. Roberts was not becoming a predictable writer.   In \\"THE SEARCH\\" I enjoyed getting to know the characters, but unlike some readers, was not bored with the dog training.  I felt the core lessons being taught to the dogs tied into the main story line very well.  I really enjoyed Simon too.  He was funny and frustrating - like some men in my life.  I love how Nora Roberts books introduces the reader to different parts of the world, and different careers/interests of the main characters.  From scuba diving for treasure in \\"The Reef\\" to being in Ireland in the \\"Irish Jewels Trilogy\\" to Daniel MacGregor matchmaking his children and grandchildren to going off-planet in the J.D. Robb Series, I can stay home and be transported by Ms. Roberts words.  Nora Roberts provides me with mystery, romance, humor, and suspense - whatever my mood, she has a book that will grab my interest.  I eagerly await each new release and hope she has so many stories in her head that she is unable to retire until I am too old to read!
B0013D4U5O|5.0|I walk four miles a day and during this time, I get to listen to my audio books and let me tell you this one is so engrossing and downright entertaining, I can't wait to go on my walk each day just to find out what happens next.  Patricia Cornwell has always been a wonderful author but this two series book set, Black Notice and The Last Precinct have by far been my favorites.  Let me tell you , when I knew there was a \\"sequel\\" for the Black Notice when I was finished I was estatic, heck, it was like Christmas came early.  You can't describe the wonderful details , Patricia has brought these characters to life and I just can't wait to see what she has to offer me next.  Thank you to her for her career choice in making all our lives a little nicer when we get to hang with Kay Scarpetta, Pete Marino, Lucy, and all the rest.  \\"THANK YOU!\\"
B0021L8V1Q|1.0|Oh hey, there'll be spoilers. Also, this has been heavily edited from the two paragraph blurb it once was. Now you know.    Iron Man. We saw in the first movie an arrogant, hedonistic, self-absorbed playboy brought low. We saw him build himself back up again into something greater. He was still self-absorbed, arrogant and hedonistic, but now he was less like someone they'd make a reality show after and more like James Bond. He's still going to chase the girl and have a good time doing his job, but he's still the guy who's going to save the world.    On top of that, we had an excellent cast, and they played to their strengths. Jeff Bridges was the most subdued, interesting villain I've seen in a long time. Gwyneth Paltrow played the smart, independent, savvy personal assistant who's not above knocking her boss down a peg when he needs it. Terrence Howard was fantastic as Rhodey. Even John Favreau, the director himself, was amusing as Happy the bodyguard in the scene he had.    Four writers crafted a character story in the guise of an action movie in the superhero genre that wouldn't be seen again until The Dark Knight.    SO WHAT HAPPENED?! Why did the second movie suck?!     Well, Robert Downey Jr. was so impressed with the movie Tropic Thunder that he brought the co-screen writer for that movie to write Iron Man 2. There are some wonderful one-person talents who can write science fiction adventure well (Nicholas Meyer from Star Trek 2 and 6 immediately comes to mind), but unfortunately this guy isn't one of them. And John Favreau, the director, seems to know nothing at all when it comes to directing action scenes; the weakest part of the first movie is the anti-climactic action scene near the end. This combination has led to a watered down movie, where too many things happen too quickly, there are entirely too many characters to focus on, the hype of the upcoming Avengers movie washes away the main story, the action is atrocious, and it's hard to sit through.    Iron Man 2. We finally have the back story out of the way. We finally can get to the action, crafted expertly into a story around Tony Stark becoming the alcoholic danger to himself and others he's known best for. We can finally see Rhodey don his own suit and take up the mantel while Tony puts himself back together...again. We can see Pepper Potts doing her thing, and Happy doing his. Mix it up with the occasional reminder of the Avengers Initiative and you have a movie as worthwhile as the first one. Maybe we'll get a Big Bad as great as Jeff Bridges. And maybe John Favreau will let someone else direct the action after all the criticism he got over the first movie.    We didn't get any of that, did we? We didn't get a great action movie, we got Science Comic Con. A convention? The movie centers around a science convention?! Did we stumble into a sitcom along the way to the theater by accident, because an action movie that costs tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to make shouldn't have the plot of a Simpsons episode.     In the Marvel universe, vibranium is kind of a naturally occurring alloy on Earth, and Tony Stark was a raving alcoholic. In the movie, Tony Stark only has a drinking problem on his birthdays and he's dying unless he invents vibranium. I know where this is going. Tony's dad first invented vibranium and created Captain America's shield with it, so we'll see that tie in for that movie. But in changing this up in the movie universe, we take away the one thing Tony Stark is sort of best known for: he is his own worst enemy. He doesn't have some great inner demon to fight in this movie like he did in the first one, he just has daddy issues that kind of show up when the plot requires.    What happened to the great characters in the first movie? Tony Stark is just annoying, Pepper Potts just dotes, Natasha (Black Widow in the comics) is just kind of there until she gets her action scene. The Avengers Initiative is talked about at a doughnut shop.     Mickey Rouke...remember in the trailers, we're promised what should be an epic game of cat and mouse, or some epic power struggle, between Tony Stark and Ivan Vanko? Ivan, who promises to tear down the good name of Stark? What happened to that? Suddenly he becomes a bit player in his own story? We're barely even introduced to Sam Rockwell's character, yet he gets more attention in the movie?    Sam Rockwell's character manages to be twice as annoying as Tony Stark. That's hard to watch.    Don Cheadle just looks bored through the whole movie. Terrence Howard was so much more enjoyable to watch. And how does this work? He's after the power suit but Tony doesn't want to give it to him. Tony says in the Senate hearing that he and his power suit are one; his chest piece powers the suit, after all. So how does Rhodey get the power suit to even work in the first place if there's nothing to power it? Because if Tony Stark just put an arc reactor in the suit yet meant to test Rhodey...the reasoning just falls apart.    All the elements were there to make a fantastic movie. We even see a lot of these elements get wasted. Tony Stark working to find out the history between his family and Ivan Vanko while he battles his alcoholism. Ivan Vanko setting out to destroy Tony Stark's reputation while he's up to his own scheme. Tony knowing he's having some serious issues, so he willingly gives Rhodey the suit (Rhodey personally of course, not the U.S. government). Rhodey having to become War Machine and learn he may be in over his head as a superhero. Natasha coming as a secret agent to keep tabs on Tony, bugging his house, stealing the plans for building the suit, reporting back to Nick Fury to see if he's ready to be an Avenger. Pepper Potts figuring out what's going on with Natasha and Nick Fury. Hopefully some great action in all the right places.    But no. We got crap. We got a bad movie, with a terrible story and talent terribly wasted. The first Iron Man was a great movie, oneof the top superhero movies in spite of its flaws. Iron Man 2 is a thoughtless popcorn flick. It falls in line with Spider-man 3 as the most disappointing movie I've seen.

B0007TKNIS|2.0|The images are stunning.  The costumes are devine.  The cast is beautiful.  The music is haunting.  I can't believe I used up my \\"promise to see one chick flick with you\\" that my husband gave me on this.  How could something with so many lovely parts be so wrong?  I loved the Broadway production.  I own the book.  But this film which I waited for with baited breath was so....... blah. Okay. If the cover on a romance novel could come to life it would be this movie.  Seriously.  And at the end when they pull off Eric's mask... the dude is handsome.  My husband leaned over and whispered, \\"Oh, no!  I've got a zit!  I'm hidious!  Don't look at me!\\"  And the ending (which they had to change so people who read the book and saw the play would have something new to see) is depressing. For all of it's breathtakingly beautiful parts, the whole is a Frankenstein.

B001BPJJ82|5.0|There is no doubt the visuals are what people will talk about first, when discussing this movie.  Yes, they are as fantastic as you've heard or read - especially on this Blu-Ray disc.  However, I also found the story unique, too, (mostly good, some bad), and the acting of little Catinca Intaru, from Bucharest, fantastic.     The young Romanian, who learned English a few years ago, reportedly beat out 400 others to get this role, and I can see why. She is spectacular, keeping you riveted to the screen along with the incredible cinematography.    The amazing visuals and the memorable \\"Alexandria\\" played by Intaru combine to make this an entertaining DVD.
0307592839|4.0|I had read The Keep and liked it, but wasn't sure how I'd like this book as the review I read made it seem very confusing. My book club decided to read this so I figured I'd give it a go. Much to my surprise, any confusion that I had initially, cleared up as I read further. Yes, it seemed like a lot of short stories tied together by characters, but it was a lot more than that. The stories could be read separately but the relationships became clearer with each chapter. Little details linked, and I found myself flipping back to earlier stories for the \\"aha, that's the little detail.\\" The chapter done in Powerpoint was amazing. I thought it was absolutely brilliant. I've since learned that the author's website has the actual Powerpoint on it, so I'm going to check that out. It's not an easy read, thus the 4, but it's worth any stretch you might have to make. I have read very few books a second time, only 2, but I'm planning to make this book the third that I re-read. I recommend it highly.

Fun songs like \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" and \\"Without Me\\" made me smile and grin as he hides behind the tears of a clown. Maybe I will just keep my \\"Curtain Call\\" CD but I was hoping for more cleverness, more heart and more being different and unique staying on top and making the rest look second rate. While I admit I did like quite a few from \\"Relapse\\", this CD is probably not gonna be in my player too often if ever again. When I'm cleanin' out my closet, this may be the first thing to go.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Zombie culture aficionados rejoice! Your movie has arrived.    If you are a reader of zombie books, a lover of zombie movies, a player of zombie video-games (esp. that last one), you are in for a treat. Off the top of your head, how many rules can you think of for interacting with zombies? If you can think of more than 5, \\"Zombieland\\" is for you.     Unlike your uninitiated friends, you do not panic when confronted with zombies. You are well aware of their limitations. You understand that the situation calls for a cool assessment of priorities and resources, and suitable action. You've got to unlock a door while being chased by zombies. But they're closing the distance too fast. Do you turn around, scream horribly, and wait to be devoured?    NO! This is not some goofy B-movie!     You take a lap! Zombies are not bright! They don't know to just wait by the door until you come back and then eat you. They will follow you! All you have to do is put some distance between you and them, run back to the door with more time, and calmly let yourself in.     If this all makes sense to you, buy \\"Zombieland.\\" If you fantasize about finding a massive cache of large caliber weapons and ammunition during a post-apocalyptic scenario, buy \\"Zombieland.\\" If you plot what you would salvage from grocery stores after a zombie attack, buy \\"Zombieland.\\" In fact, just buy \\"Zombieland.\\" You'll thank me for it.

B002WY65VU|5.0|I have watched this movie that I have received from amazon. Zombieland is a good movie by itself, as I have watched it before. But the quality of the dvd I have recieved is even better than the first time I watched it. The image was crisp, clear, and almost real to me, and it isn't even blue ray. The movie itself, a zombie movie, consists of good humor and good gore. (spoiler) I didn't even get sick as the clown zombie's head was smashed in. (end spoiler) Most of the zombie movies I have watched were more serious than funny, and the mood usually got in the way of my enjoyment of the movie. when I watched Sean of the Dead, it was funny, yes, but the humor was unnecessary and almost sickening at some parts. While I do sometimes enjoy British humor, I will never understand it. Zombieland offered a different sort of humor. It was funny, I understood it, and it almost helped with character development. all in all, it was a very good movie. I look forward to when my brother can watch it. He doesn't like zombie movies, but he said this one looked good. And it was.

B001TODCII|5.0|So many action movies just have spectacular and unrealistic explosions for their own sake. You won't find much of the pointless effects in this one. This one has a story behind it.    Enter Brian, a retired special forces operator who wants only to spend time wiht his daughter, access to whom is blocked by his estranged ex-wife and new husband. While he does his best to ensure she knows he loves her, she is a teenager and is really only concerned with herself. When she lies to him for permission to go to Paris, he reluctantly allows it provided she follow some requirements. She cannot even fulfill the first, which is to call him when the plane lands. While she is an innocent, he has traveled the world trouble-shooting and knows the dangers that await the unwary. Dangers that find his innocent daughter when she is kidnapped to be sold into slavery.    Now, while he had been retired to be close to her, she has not been taken from him. Retirement is postponed. His pursuit is fast, brutal and relentless. The criminals who seek to prevent his recovery get shown no mercy. We see wonderfully choreographed fight scenes, quick and severe as they should be considering the stakes. We get to see the difference between mere thugs and a trained military professional. The criminals don't deserve mercy. Plowing through the seedy underworld of Paris, Brian moves further and further along the chain until he learns where his daughter is being sold.     Overcoming adversity after obstacle after impediment, Brian refuses to give up. The final scenes show this determination come to the fore as he ignores wounds to continue his mission. While some of the gunplay near the end gets a bit extravagant, with automatic weapons being sprayed as stunt performers dive behind furniture somewhat reminiscent of Bruckheimer movies, it is for the most part well-done and not over glorified. It's a dirty business and it's shown that way.    The stunt driving is extraordinary, not as fantastic as Ronin but certainly close to the same league. The story marches on without needless diversions, and while the resolution comes somewhat abruptly, with no bridge between the final act of retribution and the return to the States, it's forgiveable.     While I would have liked Brian to tell his daughter off a bit about why he'd given her the rules in the first place, he's just not an \\"I told you so\\" kinda guy. He does what he does, he loves his daughter, and he's forthright about it all.    While this version does give the theatrical and extended versions, there are no other special features. If you need the commentaries and behind the scenes features, you should limit yourself to the two-disc set. If you just want to watch a gritty and well-done action movie with realistic action, characters, and plot, then you should check this out.

The rest of the story has the likeable main character watching from beyond the grave the effect her death has on devastated family and friends. The other world Susie inhabits is vividly described by author Alice Sebold.  Susie can't accept that her life is over and tries to stay connected to the people that struggle to move on without her. While the subject matter of this novel is very disturbing the book is incredible. Alice Sebold is one of the most talented storytellers out there.  All of the characters are great, especially Susie's dad Jack and Grandma Lynn. Susie's killer seriously gave me the goose bumps. There were many times I found myself crying and laughing. This is a sad yet satisfying read with an ending you will never see coming.

B003L20ICE|5.0|\\"The Kids Are All Right\\" - it seems strange to label a movie with such an unconventional story line as formulaic, but upon reflection that is the way it seemed to me. The last minutes of the film are one long tear-jerker. The acting is uniformly excellent. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore are perfectly cast and superb in their roles. The son and daughter are fine as is Mark Ruffalo as the sperm donor who causes havoc for the family. Two lesbians, years ago, used a sperm donor to have children, and the kids were anxious to meet their \\"father.\\"<br /> Bening is controlling and a perfectionist while Moore is more relaxed and free-wheeling, and Ruffalo is a self-absorbed free soul, actually a selfish lout.<br /> Some of the actions and some of the plot devices didn't ring true for me. Though I think the film tries very hard to be daring and overly explicit, I believe there is a lot to admire in it. I'm sure you'll be entertained by it as long as you aren't prudish and puritanical. The cinematography is almost too perfect in the crisp sunlit images it presents.<br />The relationship between the two women I found very affecting. But I was annoyed that to me it seemed like a twenty-first century soap opera in the era of the unzippered lifestyle and the age of trying to shock the unshockable Molly Browns left out there. \\"We'll go this far, and, you know what, we'll go just a little bit farther into shock and awe land,\\" the moviemakers seem to be saying.<br />Long ago movies breached my shock level, but I still have a discomfort zone, and that's the way I felt when the two women in bed were watching male gay porn. I don't have to know, and I don't want to know. Are such things in the movie to tell the story or to sell tickets and titillate (pardon the expression).<br />I still give this film a heads-up because it was fun watching for the most part, entertaining, touching, and well-acted. Definitely not a waste of time.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I was not a fan of director David Yates's adaptation of \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\", which was a disjointed mess that got neither the feel nor the substance of the book correct, so I was not optimistic about this sixth film in the Harry Potter series. The return of series scribe Steve Kloves seems to have made a big difference, because this movie does a great job of keeping all of the complex character interplay intact even as large chunks of plot are lost along the way. These characters felt like the characters I'd read in the books, and I care a lot more about that than having every scene from the book reproduced, however fleetingly. This is probably the least action-heavy of the movies so far, but if you don't care about the characters by now, why are you still watching?    The cinematography for the film went through a belaboured process. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel originally intended a very dark, very monochrome -- almost black and white -- look for the film. After seeing how far in that direction Delbonnel had gone, they panicked and ordered the unique look scaled back, with the color saturation boosted back up considerably. The result is a beautiful looking film, but NOT a natural looking film. The picture remains very dark, with a lot of detail lost to the shadows that there's no way of getting back. The midranges are anemic, because there simply wasn't that much detail to bring back in the first place. This is how the film looked in theaters and is NOT a fault of the Blu-ray presentation. It's how the movie's supposed to look, even if that look isn't everyone's cup of tea.

I love, love, love books set in the south, especially regarding slavery or servants like \\"The Help.\\"  \\"The Kitchen House\\" allows the reader to see all sides of a Virginia plantation.  While I find all the facts very believable, I just felt it was lacking.  Maybe because there was more pain from the characters than happiness.  I wasn't expecting feel good, but there was just too much sadness.  I did cry during one part, which I don't do very easily while reading a book.  The author did create plenty of tension which made me want to keep reading.  The story felt more like a fashion review and travel guide, still enjoyable for what it is.

0307712508|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a fascinating story.  I bought the CD box set and listen to it as I go about driving  Some of the details about the cellular research are kind of heavy.   However the author weaves in enough of the story of the Lacks family to more than compensate for those of us who have very  little background in the scientific aspects of the book.  I am glad that I am listening to it instead of reading it because I believe that I would have put the book down due to the scientific details.  I think the telling of this story reveals why it is so important to understand the concept of informed consent and bioethics.  I highly recommend the book because it does provide clear evidence of the abuses that are possible when one does not understand a process or procedure.

B003EV6DBW|3.0|I own every Doctor Who available (even discontinued) so I've followed the old doc from the November 23 debut (delayed a day because of the JFK assassination) in which William Hartnell had parked the TARDIS in a London junkyard in order to send his granddaughter to school.    The sets and effects were poor even by the standards of the time but the stories were most always solid and generally had decent science.  I feel that this fifth season of the 'new' Doctor falls short on story and science.    I have to agree with several points made in the Richard C. Drew review but maybe less harshly.    The quality of writing is down a bit.    Logic and science are often ignorned.    Explanations are often thin (like how did Rory recycle).    The 'love' factor where emotions trump science.    Lack of origaninality shown by bringing back the same old revived bad guys.    Big drop in special effects (remember the TARDIS flying through traffic a couple of years ago?).    The new TARDIS looks too junky inside.  Also, bring back all the rooms - could even do a show on it.    The eleventh doctor... not so bad.  A always miss the old doctor for awhile then get used to the new one.  As to Matt Smith, I didn't like anything about him at the very first, but he grew on me.  By the end of the season I liked him quite well (but a return to David Tenent wouldn't upset me). He just needs a better writer.    Finally, I'd like to see some fresh stuff; new planets, new aliens, solid science, better stories, an updated K-9 (like a robot that looks like a real dog), possibly a multiple-doctor story (that happened a few times before).    P.S. I like the new companions.
0307454541|5.0|I already saw the movie so i knew what the whole story was about, which I found very interesting. It's a film i'd watch over and over, just like \\"Let the Right One In\\".<br /><br />anyway, this book is one of those books where you flip to a page and start reading it for the hell of it and you find yourself wanting to read more for some reason. It captured your interest.<br /><br />I bought the book at Best Buy instead of being the 300 person in line to borrow it from the library.<br />I read a lot and so far it's good, though i skimmed the second half of the first chapter since i didn't understand all the business stuff that was being discussed. But after, it got good and more captivating.<br />It's like the movie here and there but you get to learn more indepth detail about the different characters and thier lives and so forth. I have two other books i'm reading at this time as well, but \\"dragon\\" is more interesting of the three. Highly recommened.<br /><br />it's a murder/mystery novel, though while reading it, it reminded me of Shutter Island.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I have not given up hope yet that this won't get picked up for a second season, but if it doesn't this will be a waste of a great show.  With one of the better casts on television and a great premise this show was a lot of fun to watch. I really felt it could be the perfect successor show for all of us Lost fans.  Even if the show doesn't get picked up I still recommend this DVD set for anyone who likes good TV. The first season plays well as a self-contained story for the most part, aside from a few lose ends you'll be pleased you watched it.
B0036S4CTS|2.0|(no spoilers) I absolutely loved this book until the ending - which ruined it for me.  The characters were engaging, relatable, likeable and fun. I liked the flow of the writing style and the changing from his and her point of view.  I thought the character development was right on track, that is, up until the ending.  I found the ending a cop out, and predictable as a result of some blatant foreshadowing by the author.  I just expected more from the author - after bringing on this journey with these characters I felt empty by where he took them.  I ended the book feeling nothing at all - which was such a departure from what I felt a few chapters earlier.  I just expected more than the \\"movie of the week\\" ending and that's why I wouldn't recommend this book unless you want to be disappointed.
0061906220|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Pete the Cat art and was thrilled when I discovered this book at the library.  My daughter is 3 and after reading it 1 time, we were all hooked!  We are now about to purchase our own copy because she will be quite upset when we have to return it to the library.      We love the illustrations, the repetition, and our made up tune to the song.  When I say, \\"Did Pete Cry?\\", my daughter will say...\\"GOODNESS NO!\\".      I disagree with the library review which refers to the moral of the story.  In my opinion, the moral of the story is about letting those little things roll off your back.  There's no need to cry over dirty shoes...\\"you just keep walking along and singing your song...It's all good\\".      Get this book, read it with your kids, and keep singing your song!
0061537969|4.0|This book is unlike many books that I've read. The idea of it is rather original and fun. I've never read a book told from the dog's point of view, so I didn't quite know what to expect. Much to my surprise, this dog is witty, smart, and insightful. The story is told chronologically, and it's really easy to read. The characters were somewhat likable, but nevertheless it was a very interesting and fast-paced book. It took me only two days to finish. I thought the ending was seamless and beautiful, even though it's heavily foreshadowed.     There were some definite flaws to the story but if you're looking for a quick, fun read to pass some time by the pool, then I strongly recommend this book.
0684135051|3.0|I resisted buying this book for many years simply because of the annoying cult of personality that surrounds Elizabeth Zimmermann.  It is quite tiresome to read fulsome praise for her all the time.  To a new knitter (I started knitting in 1999), it doesn't really matter that she invented groundbreaking techniques, because those techniques were already established by the time I learned to knit.<br /><br />However, Amazon had it on sale and I was placing an Amazon Fresh order.  I needed $10 to bump my order over the free delivery line, so I threw this in.<br /><br />Other than the cover, the book looks very old.  This is to say that its formatting and presentation (and b&w pictures, and the pictures being of very old-fashioned things) make it look like an old book reprinted.  I have a reprint of an 1892 knitting book and this looks very similar in its layout.  The text occupies a relatively small part of the page, there are about 2\\" margins on most pages, which seems like a huge waste of paper.<br /><br />Yes, all the pictures are of knitted items laying flat on a surface, which is not a flattering way to photograph knitted items (IMHO they should be on a model).  The knitted sweaters all seem to be constructed for tiny little people - for example, the armhole openings on a yoked sweater appear to be only about 15\\" around, whereas the pullovers I've been knitting all these years have 20-24\\" armhole openings.  The garments all have a quaint 1950s design.<br /><br />What really bothered me was the blabby tone of the text!  I like knitting books with instructions and techniques and good photos, but this book is full of chitchat about stuff that only vaguely relates to knitting.  I did get one good technique out of it - the sewn cast-off, which works marvellously with machine-knit raw edges - but that's about the only worthwhile thing in here that I didn't already know (or didn't know where else to learn about it).<br /><br />I think that when books are reprinted they should be reformatted and nicely typeset.  This is a bit boring even at the price.uld be reformatted and nicely typeset.  This is a bit boring even at the price.

B001OQCV2E|2.0|We all know the plot by now: the world as we know it ends by 2012.  Exactly why or how it ends is irrelevant - it ends and Roland Emmerich has used this opportunity to combine every one of his previous disaster movies into one big orgy of destruction.<br /><br />2012 takes two divergent paths: that of the people in power (the upper class) and that of everyday folks just trying to get along (the middle class). John Cusack is Jackson Curtis, author of a prophetic book titled Farewell Atlantis, has fallen far short of his dreams.  He's a limo driver for a Russian billionaire, is divorced from his wife, and estranged from his kids.  Calamity strikes while Curtis is on a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park with his kids, and it just so happens that he finds a prophet of the apocalypse (Charlie Frost, played by Woody Harrelson) Park is the site of a government coverup. Armed with a map of the elites' plan for survival, Curtis returns home to rescue his wife from certain doom by driving a limo across gaping chasms, through collapsing buildings, and around thousands of dead bodies.<br /><br />Sorry, did we not mention the dead bodies?  With all the talk of how fun and exciting the special effects are in 2012, it's easy to miss that the film depicts thousands of people dying.  They fall off boats, plunge out of buildings, get hit by cars, are crushed by tsnumais, and burned by explosions.  They are all displayed in tiny, minute detail by Emmerich's special effects team.  This is mass murder, beautifully rendered.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the heads of state from around the world plan to escape - not by spaceship, but by ark, just like Noah. The American President (Danny Glover) acquits himself admirably but his minions do not, and it's a dog eat dog battle as politicians vie for dominance over the military. There's also the matter of having to buy a ticket to get on the arks, fewer than planned because the apocalypse came a bit earlier than expected.  The irony is that the only country capable of marshalling this level of manufacturing might is China.<br /><br />2012 seems to run out of ideas about halfway through and then just starts recycling them.  There isn't one but two races for survival as improbable vehicles jump gaping chasms (first a camper, than a limo). There isn't one but two planes escaping from collapsing ground and dodging falling debris.  2012 has one shtick - escape by the skin of your teeth - and plays it over and over.<br /><br />When that gets tiresome, and without the special effects on the big screen it gets tiresome quickly, issues are invented.  The improbable climax in the ark rivals the stupidity of everything that's gone before, including: a huge gear that powers a titanic door getting stuck by a power cord, the ark is built so that \\"if its doors aren't closed the engine won't start,\\" and the fact that, in light of a scientist's plea to treat the unruly masses left behind more ethically, even more die as a result of his altruism.<br /><br />Emmerich has a point to make, and he makes it by blowing up religious and political icons everywhere.  The President won't save you.  America won't save you.  Even God won't save you. The only thing that will save you is a little luck, a lot of perseverance, and Roland Emmerich as your director.<br /><br />This isn't really a film so much as a series of set pieces.  Every disaster is choreographed in slow motion so we can take in every detail.  As a special effects demo it's great, but as a movie it's merely mediocre.f marshalling this level of manufacturing might is China.      2012 seems to run out of ideas about halfway through and then just starts recycling them.

044656740X|4.0|I wasn't a very business-savy person when I first read this book, but I think my mindset on how to make money changed for the better after completing the book!  Kiyosaki keeps his writing style simple, and down-to-earth, and that makes the book flow nicely, and you will finish it in just a couple of days.  Kiyosaki thinks like a bondafide venture capilatist, and he dispels the notion that a person's house is their biggest asset, it is infact the biggest liability.  That's a point he emphasizes constantly, while simplifying how to create streams of income, and take advantage of investment opportunities.  He really just gives the reader a system of thought that can help to become wealthy.  It's worthwhile, give it a read...
030726999X|5.0|Stieg Larsson left us too soon, but he left us one heck of a parting gift.  The Millenium trilogy has burst on the scene like a thunderbolt and its echoes show no signs of fading any time soon.<br /><br />This trilogy is fresh and vibrant, replete with a fantastic sense of place (modern-day Sweden) and well-rounded cast of characters.  Larsson's general thesis is clear - there are men in very high places who cannot stand women, but there are also plenty of women (and men) who stand ready, willing and able to take them down.  It is a well-publicized secret that Larsson allegedly wanted to title \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" as \\"Men Who Hate Women,\\" but (thankfully) was talked out of it.  In no way did he take this theme from his books, however.<br /><br />\\"Hornet's Nest\\" kicks off as a continuation of \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire.\\"  The misfit waif, Salander, is heading to the hospital with a bullet in her brain, courtesy of her father (the Soviet defector Zalachenko) and her gargantuan half-brother.  Thanks to Salander and, to a lesser extent, the crusading journalist Mikael Blomquist, both father and half-brother are also considerably the worse for wear.  Unknown to Salander and her evil kin, their family squabble has started the gears turning in The Section, a clandestine unit within the Swedish secret police.  This is the group that has enabled Zalachenko for years due to his national security value, and as part of that enabling The Section has inflicted some of the most infuriating injustices imaginable upon young Salander.<br /><br />This is the titular hornet's nest, and boy are the hornets angry.  As they saying goes, you wouldn't like them when they're angry.<br /><br />Without trying to be too political, I think one of the reasons Larsson's books have found such an adoring audience here in the States is his ability to tap into the frustrations of a people at the mercy of a government that is only too willing to play the \\"national security\\" card.  As the Washington Post has recently documented, the United States has evolved into a security state, with billions upon billions spent on high-tech security systems that do little apparent good but are both cumbersome and maddening to anyone who cares about personal freedom - which is to say virtually all Americans.<br /><br />The Section and its henchmen are a true villain for our times, and it is exhilirating how Blomquist, Salander, and their friends - as ordinary and yet special a bunch of heroes as has been recently assembled - take the fight to the foe.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a melancholy book as Larsson's early passing looms over the book.  Yes, there is the promise of a half-written manuscript residing on a hard drive somewhere, but it is clear that the world has lost a freedom-loving, crusading spirit who had much left to say.  While we are thankful that we got to hear his voice at all, one cannot help but wonder what other adventures and lessons he had in store for us.documented, the United States has evolved into a security state, with billions upon billions spent on high-tech security systems that do little apparent good but are both cumbersome and maddening to anyone who cares about personal freedom - which is to say virtually all Americans.

B003K025V4|4.0|Hallelujah! Hannah Montana is gone and Miley is finally all grown up and is finally coming into her own!! I'll be honest and say I'm 25 years old and I genuinely like this album!! Now I know this young woman can really sing, 11 of the 12 songs are amazing new and fresh. I will shout it from any roof that I'm now a Miley Cyrus fan!! I'll be honest and say that before this album was released I did like some of her \\"Disney\\" music such as I miss you, Fly on the wall, Party in the USA, The climb etc... However, I prefer this side of Miley much better because she is becoming real and honest with herself and the world, so way to go Miley you have made a fan out of me!!<br /><br />Now for the reason I gave this album a 4 out 5 stars...The reason is simple \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn\\" I grew up in the late 80's early 90's and loved the whole hair metal scene and so when I found out that Bret Michaels (Whom I love) was letting Miley Cyrus cover this song I knew that she was going to butcher it and I'm sorry but I feel like this song should not have been touched by her. I know times are changing and so is the music business but I feel there are certain songs that should not be touched and \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn\\" is a classic.<br /><br />Other than that this album is great and Miley has my support!! I can't wait for more albums from her if they are going to like \\"Can't Be Tamed!\\"

B0000BWTK3|4.0|This CD has one of the more splendid Grieg Piano Concerto recordings on it that I own, and I own many.  Curiously, since the creation of the long playing record, the Grieg Concerto is almost always paired with Schumann's Piano Concerto.  I don't really get the resemblance, yet the minds behind this pairing must be of the opinion that one can't be done without the other, so there you are.  The Schumann seems like an addendum here; its OK though not on the same ultra high level as the Grieg.<br /><br />Leif Ove Andsnes clearly distinguishes this Grieg Concerto from its modern day competition.  He plays with sizzling rhythmic precision; that is a constant with this fine artist.  His more recent Haydn Sonata recording displays just how perfectly he can play fast passages with every note perfectly balanced in time no matter the speed. Everything is in its proper place.  But its not just timing, its also the ability to gauge volume in a rapidly moving line.  Every note seems to be calibrated to fit with the previous as well as the next one.  Few pianists indeed have this ability in such abundance as does Andsnes.<br /><br />The Grieg has more going for it than just the rhythm of timing and dynamics; Andsnes brings to it an incisive dramatic tension. The contrasts in mood are excellent. It may be the best version of a still young artist out there who is of the generation that almost all make Prokofiev the model of tonal beauty and rich phrasing.  Is it possible that so few \\"artists\\" have Andsnes' latter-day insight into this concerto?<br /><br />Oddly, here the Schumann concerto seems not to be Andsnes cup of tea.  The competition is far fiercer too.  He is not as flexible in the Schumann as he is disciplined in the Grieg.  That's the only real problem with this the second piece on the CD.  Still, even if the Grieg were the only thing on the disc it would be worth purchasing. For that reason alone, this recording is highly recommended.

0440241901|4.0|My writing often gets compared to Sophie Kinsella's, so I decided to pick up this book to see for myself. I can see some similarities with regard to the sense of humor, so I definitely enjoyed the style of this book.<br /><br />The premise is quite clever ... Woman thinks she's about to die so she starts babbling to the guy next to her, revealing things she'd never reveal if she didn't think she was about to die.  Then, not surprisingly, that guy winds up being her boss (a few levels up).  It creates a great environment to play with as a writer - good suspense, great dialogue, ample flirtation and build up. Kinsella takes full advantage and gives you plenty of time to get to know the very likable and very real main character.  She's as flawed as any one of us, and that's a good thing.  She's a bit of an underdog in some respects so you can't help but to route for her and her budding romance.  My only complaint would be that I didn't get nearly as good of a vibe and mental picture of the love interest until pretty late in the book.<br /><br />This book is definitely worthy of being classified in the chick lit genre and could easily make for a cute romantic comedy.  If you're a fan of the genre, this book is certainly worth a read.<br /><br />-Jenn<br />[[ASIN:1442146869 Reunion]]<br />[[ASIN:B003CJU47U The Cinderella Curse]]

B0024RID6U|2.0|This is my first experience with the 2009 remastered reissues of Stone discs, but it seems to suffer the same as reviews I have read about the other albums.  The music has been compressed to make it louder and more \\"modern\\" sounding.  The new version IS louder and more \\"modern\\" sounding, so they succeeded in that sense.  They failed in the sense that the music now sounds squished together. The original version was much more interesting to listen to with it's \\"sparser\\" mix.    The version of Slave is the unedited version, which is interesting to hear, but ultimately not as satisfying as the original issue.    It is still the Stones and still one of my all time favorite albums, but I am not going to get rid of my original copy.  If you want this disc, go and find an original issue.

1892005034|4.0|This is an excellent book in many ways. The author is teaching a language of authenticity or of the heart. The purpose of teaching this language is that people will find it easier to express their desires in a way that does not make others defensive so that they may better get their needs met.<br /><br />The author teaches that it is not good to flatter people or to give them encouragement like \\"way to go\\".

I only know of her philosophy from a beginners philosophy course that I took and she was one of the many philosophers on ethics.

I only know of her philosophy from a beginners philosophy course that I took and she was one of the many philosophers on ethics.<br /><br />The Cd is awful!

B000002UBB|5.0|Texas bred rocker Steve Miller released his tenth album entitled Fly Like an Eagle in May of 1976.<br />This was Steve's first new album of all new material since the 1973 album The Joker put him on the map thanks to that album's title cut becoming a hit.<br />However, after almost eight years of being on the road and making seven great albums (classics like Brave New World, Sailor and Chilren of the Future for example), Steve burned himself out and he retired and bought a farm in Medford, Oregon and didn't record for almost two years. Then in spring of 1975, whilst writing songs and demoing, Steve got a call from Pink Floyd (one of rock's greatest bands and at the time previewing their upcoming followup to Dark Side of the Moon called Wish You Were Here on its 1975 tour (album was released in September, 1975)) and the band asked him to open up for them at Knebworth Park in England to 125,000 people. As it turned out, Steve upstaged Pink Floyd (whose set was marred by technical problems that day) and premiered the song \\"Rock 'n Me\\" which he wrote specifically as a showstopper for the show and had Doug Clifford of Creedenceon drums, Les Dudek on guitar and Lonnie Turner on bass to help Steve for the show.<br />With the momentum going from his concert with Pink Floyd, he went in the recording studio with bass player Lonnie Turner and drummer Gary Mallaber and recorded 20 plus tracks in 12 days. That could have made a double album but Steve played it safe and put out Fly Like an Eagle and then Book of Dreams (see review) a year later.<br />Would this album be a classic or redundant, read on and find out (as I did when I got the album in June, 1991 on cassette (with original vinyl track listing restored by 1991) and later CD).<br />We begin the album with winds ala echo-plex and the synthesizer laced \\"Space Intro\\" which was a great intro. Then the echo-plexed winds segue into the album's title cut which was a Top 5 hit in early 1977. The song developed from when it was called \\"In the Ghetto\\" in the early 1970s. The song has a great riff, great vocals and superb synthesizer effects which go throughout the track and the synthesizer echoed ending was superb and the beeps at the end were from the master tape. Next is \\"Wild Mountain Honey\\" which is a nice relaxing number which doesn't change key during the song but doesn't bore one. Next is the rocker \\"Serenade\\" which is a great rocker and had Steve singing all of the harmonies and just rocks. We then have the country-ish \\"Dance Dance Dance\\" which is country to the core and features some great acoustic work from Steve and dobro from John McFee. This track was inexplicably excised from the mid-1980s reissued LP or cassette for some reason but appeared on the original album, cassette (and the 1991 cassette reissue), 8-track and CD (remastered CD version as well). Next is a rockified version of \\"Mercury Blues\\" which is a great rocking version of the blues standard about the car and Steve made the track his own.<br />The album's second half starts with the rocking first single \\"Take The Money And Run\\" which was a Top 10 hit in the Summer of 1976. The song was a story of a man and woman trying to rob some cash and the song was chosen as a single after kids at an elementary school liked what they heard. The #1 hit \\"Rock 'n Me\\" follows and is a great rocker (see early in review for song's creation). Next is the remake of the late Sam Cooke's ballad \\"You Send Me\\". This remake is superb with excellent electric guitar playing and harmonies all from Steve. This track, like \\"Dance Dance Dance\\", was not on the mid-1980s reissued LP or cassette version for some reason but appeared on the original album, cassette (and the 1991 cassette reissue), 8-track and CD (and remastered CD) versions. The second of two instrumentals \\"Blue Odyssey\\" is next and is called a poor man's Space Intro but with great synthesizer work and the synthesizer used was ironically an ARP Odyssey synthesizer, hence the name. Thenthe echoplexed induced wind segues into the bluesy \\"Sweet Maree\\" which featured the legendary James Cotton on harmonica and staccato acoustic guitar with limited lyrics from Miller and is a showcase for Cotton's harmonica and Miller's bluesy electric guitar soloing.

1573229725|2.0|I secured this book specifically because of the glowing Amazon reviews. The first 100 pages left me uninspired. I stuck w/the text though; hoping it was just off to a slow start. It does get better towards the middle, however, it never really picked up tempo, remaining redundant and constantly supplemented with non essential fluff throughout. The insane asylum piece drug on and on. \\"I'm not Maude, I'm Susan\\" torture, beating, humiliation, cold baths ensue, lather - rinse- repeat. Her escape and subsequent return to London were interesting, but the much hyped plot twists and turns were predictable. I could also do without the lesbian love affair. All around it fell flat of my five star expectations. Boo.

0060558121|1.0|An interesting concept that might have held up for a short story, but was dreadful as a novel. Repeatedly out of control side tracks into exposition that is not terribly important. Slowly the pieces fit together around page 500. If I had not been on vacation, I would have given up on it long before. I now regret wasting the time I did spend on it. I want those hours back. I also want the editor who greenlighted this mess fired. This desperately needs editing down to 250pp. The author's ego (and lack of restraint by editors) left the barn long ago. Would that I could select half a star for this one.

SO,     If you want a working digital copy, DO NOT USE THIS VENDOR!    Jesse
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Picked up this watch from Amazon about a month or so ago and so far it's been great.  The price point is hard to believe considering you're getting a Seiko 5 and it looks good to boot!    I've gotten a handful of compliments on the watch and it's rugged \\"look\\", most people can't believe it's a Seiko when I tell them.  The self winding is nice and as others mentioned above it tends to get off by a minute or so a month but so far mine is still dead on when compared to the clock I used when setting the initial time.  This was my first watch with an integrated day/date window and I had some issues getting it set correctly initially (multiple languages, it wasn't midnight so the day would shift early, etc.) but that was mostly due to my ignorance.  I haven't tested it's water resistance claims and usually ditch the watch before I shower, swim, etc. (not to mention nylon bands can smell funky over time if wet and dried frequently) but it's taken a couple good lickings from door knobs, walls, etc. and hasn't skipped a beat.  I have also worn it to the range with my pistol (a lot of vibration and jerking) and everything still runs smooth.    For me personally I'm debating picking up a couple more of these and storing them while I can still get my hands on them.    I love the face of this watch with it's minutes being the largest and easily readable measure of time followed by the smaller hours, telling time at a glance is only easier on a digital IMHO. I also love the smooth movement of the second hand on this thing, but it's taken some getting used to.  I am used to looking to down at a watch and seeing the second hand jerk around the face, a lot of times I'll have to do a double take because I think the second hand has stopped moving because of how smooth the movement actually is (1/4 second movements).

1439165645|4.0|Richard Morais' book The Hundred Foot Journey is a culinary feast that will have you sampling the lives of families, dreams and my favorite topic, food. To truly appreciate the nuances of the book one probably needs to be somewhat of a gastronome with an understanding of the history and culture of food in France.<br /><br />Who did I hear about this book? I had the pleasure of meeting the author at the BBC reception in NYC. Morais is a former editor for Forbes magazine. He resided in London and is now back in the US.<br /><br />Why did I decide to read it? The author did a great job of self promoting his book-although this was not a hard sell for me. I knew it was about an Indian family and food. ( I cannot remember if I knew that they would go to France-just saying food, India and France would be enough for me). PS. I am a shallow cover reader and I really like the cover of this book.<br /><br />Morais tells the story of the Haji family. The title of the book, The Hundred Foot Journey is symbolic of the Haji's acceptance into the community and the Hassan's journey. From a small food stand in India, the family finds their calling and success in life. As often happens in life, circumstances takes the family from the warmth and hospitality of India, to the dampness of England. While on a road trip on the continent the family settles into a little village, Lumierie nestled in the French countryside complete with cobblestone streets and a daily market.<br /><br />The Hundred Foot Journey tells the story of the Haji family, life as migrants and the story of the French's relationship with food. Throughout the book, Morais shares the intimacy that the French have with their food. Morais makes reference to the bible of French cooking, The Escoffier, the treasured Michelin ratings, France's 35 hour work week and the dreaded Vat. It was these small truffles that Morais has inserted into the book that made it truly special for me. I am not sure if the average reader who is not familiar with the French food culture would appreciate these little details.<br /><br />I found it interesting that he had the Haji's settling in France England would have been more obvious. I am not sure if I have ever seen an Indian restaurant in France. Morais was able to both characterize the differences between the two cultures and have demonstrate their clashing through his three main characters, the patriarch of the family, his son and Mrs. Mallory the spinster French chef.<br /><br />Was there anything I did not like-200 pages into the book there was some unnecessary adult language-why he chose the English words I do not know, there may be the French equivalent-cannot say as my knowlege of French slang is lacking.<br /><br />I also wished he had included some recipes.food culture would appreciate these little details.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|My grand daughter recently lost her Corolle doll, which she has had since she was 2 years old. She was heart broken. We search every where with no luck. Now that her birthday is coming up my daughter found this site with my grand daughter's   beloved Corolle doll. We just can,t wait to see her little face when she opens this gift! As a matter of fact, my grand daughter picked this doll out herself at the age of 2 and when we were looking for a new doll for her, she told her mom not to buy her any other doll but Corolle. That's how much she loves this baby doll. We also bought her baby sister a Corolle doll,different style of course, for her birthday as well. So we will have two every happy littles girls on their birthday.My grand daughter loves every thing about this doll and anyone who buys their child one is going to be so glad they did.

B002ZG9788|3.0|Everyone has shared their opinion of the movie, but I don't understand the growing trend for Blu-Ray's to be released with a DVD and digital copy. I could maybe understand the Digital Copy, but why the DVD? If someone is buying the Blu-Ray, why would they EVER watch the DVD version? They charge $16.99 for the DVD itself, but its thrown in this package as filler. At least have a product version where its only the Blu-Ray and sell it for less. Its a waste of materials and resources to include it with the Blu-Ray.  Thats like throwing in a Ford Focus if you buy a Mercedes.

B003LAH7MU|1.0|First the boring Christmas album and now a even more boring reworking of his songs in painful fashion with an orchestra.  I say it again after The Police reunion Sting said he was going to go back home and find ways to reinvent himself (his solo career) and come up with material that people and fans really want to hear.  He has done the complete opposite.  He seems afraid to take chances and put out some new material and take his music in a new fresh direction, and get himself back on the top of the charts again!  Fans still love him and we're waiting for that promise.  Otherwise an extended Police tour and a new Police album would be far better than what he's done so far!

044656740X|5.0|This book changed my life!  Other than the Holy Bible, it has changed the way I think about money in general.  If you want your financial outlook to be average or below, then don't get this book, but if you are willing to step out of the rat race, invest in your own future by reading this one.  Very thought provoking and well written.  It was hard for me to put this book down.  It kept me wanting to see what was on the next pages.  I would recommend this one to anyone who thinks a college education is the only way to success.  Ha! Read this and look around.  Most multimillionaires didn't master the books or get a college degree, but they mastered money! So buy books that will help you master money and you will be well on your way to mastering it yourself.

I had seen it On Demand...but,alas, no subtitles available!   There were enough questions remaining about this historic subject, that I was lead to read \\"The Queen's Husband\\" by Jean Plaidy.  What a wonderful preparation this would have been before seeing the movie!  As it happened, I still devoured the book as well...  The movie did a fine job maintaining historic faithfulness, as far as I can tell.  If you enjoy history, dabbed with hollywood, you will surely enjoy this movie!
B001NLKT60|1.0|The further you get into the book it becomes very sexually explicit. I deleted the book without even finishing it.
0307592839|5.0|When I ordered this I did not realize that it was a series of interconnected short stories, rather than a more conventional novel.  At first I was put off by the somewhat ordinary stories.  Once I became aware that the stories were connected, I realized that the sum is greater than the individual stories - a fascinating portrayal of a group of friends.  Now I wish that I had paid more attention to the details of the stories since they often become important later.  I may have to reread this book!  Many authors will use a melodramatic event to add drama to a story, but Jennifer Egan always resists such an easy approach.  The payoff is a much more realistic group of people that you will feel you somehow actually know.  I am sure that this novel will stand the test of time.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|... the future of our favorite Time Lord is safe and sound in the capable hands of Matt Smith and Steven Moffat. Yes, we all knew it was going to be tricky watching after the departure of David Tennant, which was a shock to the system, but after thirteen episodes with Smith and Moffat at the helm, I am a believer.<br /><br />The series opens with one of the better season openers of the revived series, 'The Eleventh Hour', and we are introduced to the Doctor's new persona as he descends on Amelia Pond's life and home. Moffat did something really good with this episode: he didn't waste a lot of time on the regeneration and instead dove head first into the action, which I thought was a great decision, especially after the harrowing end to Tennant, and he needed to move Smith in there fast and get people acclimated as quickly as possible. Our introduction to Amelia ~ or Amy ~ as a child, was something new as well, and was a poignant bit of storytelling. As the series progresses, Amy sort of becomes a confusing character, and a bit irritating at times, but I think that was the way she was meant to be written, considering that her life, as the Doctor said, made no sense, up until the final episodes.<br /><br />As for the writing, I think this season was a lot sharper, a lot tighter than the previous four and Moffat and the other writers definitely stepped it up a notch. There were one or two weak spots ~ there always are ~ but on the whole, I think this was the best season yet, especially the episodes penned by Moffat himself. We saw the return of River Song and the Weeping Angels ~ two episodes that will give you the creeps; we saw the return of the Silurians and the Daleks (who just can't seem to go away), the advent of the mysterious Dream Lord, and a few vampire fish thrown in for good measure. One of the finer episodes of this season was 'Vincent and the Doctor' ~ there was something very touching about that episode and it was beautifully written. The two-part finale was the best of the finales of the current show, and there was something very visceral about that Pandorica and what it was designed for.<br /><br />Now to Smith. Well, when I first heard about his casting, I was more than a little skeptical. He seemed too young for the role and I knew he would either make or break the future of the revived series. Luckily, he made it. His portrayal of the Doctor is breath of fresh air, I think.

Now to Smith. Well, when I first heard about his casting, I was more than a little skeptical. He seemed too young for the role and I knew he would either make or break the future of the revived series. Luckily, he made it. His portrayal of the Doctor is breath of fresh air, I think.

B0036EH3WU|5.0|Some peeps are crazy if you ask me. To go on loving the show for five seasons and then dismissing it comletely after the turnout of season six. The vibe that six put off made it ok for me to let the show end at the end, but luckily there are still many mysteries that are left to the viewer to be solved at the end, without the aid of any clarification.  Without a doubt in my book, the best fictional Tv series that has ever been made.<br /><br />These cats that hate on the ending seem to have gotten way to confused, and then forgot that this show is all about opening your mind to different possibilities, that they dismiss the whole series for the slightest possibility they can explain, and then make it out like the show made it too simple. Uh-oh, look again. I'm not saying that I figured out all the answers, but anytime I re watch an episode of the near hundred twenty hours of this program, I always feel like I'm getting something new for the whole puzzle...there is substance to everything... it's like a piece of cake that weighs the same as a brick.<br /><br />John Locke was a small man. Follow him from the begginig to the end, and you will see how the island seduced him into becoming the center of evil and then plays him like a pawn. I honestly love what happens to Locke in season six, as he becomes the wise cracking puppet of the smoke-- who, suprise suprise, was just trying to end up with everyones soul by the end. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't thats not really of any significance, and we'll probably never find out for certain, but its the journey, not the destination that counts here. This show is a brain melter all the way through, and always interesting and fun to follow. I'm glad I waited out on buying the DVDS because now I can just grab it all up in one swoop, with whatever extras come with. I will probably dissapear for a few days once this thing comes in the mail.
B00003CXDD|3.0|The 80s saw a renaissance in the medieval genre of films with such product as Ladyhawke,Name of the Rose,etc.George Lucas decided also to enter that area with his presentation of Willow(released May/88).Lucas(with one of director Ron Howard's earlier efforts)tries to present an epic sweep to his film from photography to music and generally succeeds in both.The film unfortunately has a tendency to lag in its plot development at times but its overall charm and the competency of its' actors helps it overcome the hurdles in the end.<br />The story involves a marked baby who is destined to rule the land,but the current Queen Bavmorda(Jean Marsh) has different thoughts on that.She tells her guards,led by her daughter Sorsha(Joanne Whalley),to seek out and bring the child to her.On her command they comb the castle dungeons and out into the hinterland for the baby.However the baby has been smuggled away and nows drifts down a river and onto the banks near a town inhabited by small Nelwyns.A farmer and wanna be sorcerer by the name of Willam(Willow)Ufgood finds the child and before he knows it is sent off with a band of his fellow villagers to return the baby to the Daikini(\\"normal\\" sized humans)from whence it came.<br />After a few harrowing incidents on the way they finally arrive at a crossroads between their land and the Daikinis.Willow tries to give the baby to the passing Daikini soldiers but to no avail.The only Daikini willing to take and look after the child is one Madmartigan(Val Kilmer),who is trapped and hanging in a crows cage at the crossroads.After much deliberation Willow releases him and hands the baby over,extracting his word he will look after the child.<br />While walking back home with second thoughts who should be seen being carried by a hawk is the baby.The hawk is being piloted by two small Brownies Rool and Franjean(Kevin Pollack and Rick Overton).Willow follows the hawk and arrives at the Brownie encampment only to come face to face with Cherlindrea,the Queen of the Fairies.She tells Willow he has been chosen by Elora Danan(the baby)to protect her and help fulfill the prophecy by living up to his potential as a sorcerer.He must take her and a wand she gives him,to an island where the sorceress Fin Raziel resides.As aides to Willow Rool and Franjean tag along on his journey.<br />They come to a tavern patronized by Draikini and quickly become persona non grata.By chance they run into Madmartigan again,who is in a pickle with a local female and her jealous husband.After a fracas involving the husband,Madmartigan and the Queens troops,Willow,Elora and Madmartigan escape and head for the island of Raziel.When they find the island Madmartigan again parts company with Willow and his charge,and Willow sails over to the tiny island.At first it appears there is no one there but a talking possum appears to tell Willow she is Raziel who has been transformed to that shape by the wicked Queen.Willow tries to transform her back but fails not once,but on two more separate occasions.Back on shore the Queens troops led by Sorsha appear with Madmartigan in hand and capture Willow and the baby also.<br />At an encampment Willow,Madmartigan and the baby,with the help of the Brownies,escape.They flee to a castle called Tir Asleen,where they had hoped to find help but everything has been turned to stone.From here they defend themselves from the evil Queens troops who descend upon the castle in droves.During the melee Willow accidentally transforms a Troll into a huge two headed creature which breathes fire,which now gives them two different enemies to battle.A pitched battle ensues but it is for naught as one of the Queens top guards steals the baby and returns it to the Queens castle.However when the dust settles Sorsha has fallen in love with Madmartigan and they now all vow to rescue the baby.<br />With the help of an old friends army Madmartigan,Willow,the Brownies and Raziel confront Queen Bavmorda outside her castle gates.Inresponse she turns them all,but Willow,into pigs.Willow now finally is able to transform Raziel into her human self and with her help and a clever ruse,they are able to storm the gates and fight their way inside to the castle keep where Bavmorda is ready to destroy Elora on an altar.Raziel fights a pitched battle with Bavmorda while Willow tries to sneak the baby out.Bavmorda catches Willow who smartly switches the baby and makes it look like he just made it disappear into thin air.As she shrieks her spell backfires and she is killed and disappears.<br />The movie ends with Willow departing his now good friends Sorsha and Madmartigan and returning back home and reuniting with his friends in the village and his family.<br />As I mentioned the movie has an epic look and feel to it but it also resembles a cross between The Lord of the Rings and Lucas's own Star Wars.I also mentioned the movie has a tendency to lag and this occurs more often than not between the action sequences when the plot is being advanced,usually when they are on their way from one point to the next contemplating the validity of their role and the journey itself.Other than that it moves along fairly well and Val Kilmer as Madmartigan gives one of the better performances of his career.Kevin Pollack and Rick Overton are the comic relief Brownies while wonderful Billy Barty appears as the village Gandolf-like wizard Hi-Aldwin.<br />Technically the movie has been transferred beautifully and has never looked better and is in a nice 2:35:1 a/r.There is a commentary track,two featurettes,one new one and one from the 80s,the theatrical trailer and a stills gallery.<br />All in all I recommend this still charming film.Not quite four stars but better than average,this film takes you for an enjoyable two hour+ adventure courtesy of George Lucas and company.all,but Willow,into pigs.Willow now finally is able to transform Raziel into

B003CNQPNS|3.0|Street Hawk was a show that ran briefly back in 1985 on ABC.  It starred Rex Smith as Jesse Mach, a motorcycle cop who was injured and relegated to a desk job. Joe Regalbuto starred as Norman Tuttle, a government engineer who builds a super-powered motorcycle named \\"Street Hawk\\".  Each week, Jesse and Norman would take on the evil-doers of the world and make the streets safe for law-abiding citizens.      The show's premise comes across to me as a bit of The Lone Ranger being crossed with another popular '80's TV show, Knight Rider. No one knows who the hero is under the mask (or in Street Hawk's case, the helmet) but he rides a computer-enhanced motorcycle replete with futuristic functionality and weaponry.    On to my review of the product itself.  Equipment used to view the series was a Sony HDTV, upconverting Toshiba DVD recorder, and 6.1 Sony Home Theater surround sound.    I enjoyed re-watching these shows as I hadn't seen them since they last went off the air in 1985 on ABC.  The suspension of dis-belief was still needed, of course, as the show was geared toward a younger audience but still it was fun seeing them again for the first time in 25 years.    However, I am docking this DVD release two stars for two big reasons:    1) The video presentation was faded and looked awfully washed out.  Yes, I know the show is 25 years old.  By contrast, the commercial DVD releases of TJ Hooker as well as Starsky and Hutch look better on my HDTV than this release did and those shows are older than this one.      2) The sound was awfully weak in some of the episodes while decent in others.  I really found myself wishing that Shout! would have taken the time to re-mix the sound into 5.1, as Universal did with their release of Miami Vice.      I think cleaning up the video and re-mixing the sound would have added a lot more bite to the release. Considering the amount of dubbed in sounds such as the motorcycle itself, laser & gunfire sounds, etc. it would have enhanced the viewing experience significantly.    On the plus side, the new interviews with Rex Smith, Joe Regalbuto and Jeannie Wilson were interesting.  If Mr. Smith happens to read this, I wish him the best of luck in finding one of the bikes from the series to show to his kids.  I've heard there's one overseas in a museum display and there is one that one of the stuntmen from the show restored and is shown riding it on a Youtube video.    The DVD case itself is good and sturdy.  Good thinking on Shout!'s part to put in the episode guide so that a viewer can find his or her favorite episodes quickly.  Putting some of the bike's blueprints in the guide was a nice touch.    All in all, this was an ok release that I feel could have been done better; however, I am surprised it was released at all considering how short the series run was.  It's too bad that the show didn't last longer as it was a fun ride and an excellent example of '80's escapism at its finest.

B001992NUQ|5.0|I do not have to tell how good is this movie... probably it would make it to the top 10 movies for a lot of people.    Anyway the quality of this blu ray is perfect. I have seen this movie like hundreds of times and with this blu-ray I saw and notice things that I haven't noticed before.
B00012BSHG|4.0|I bought this playpool for my new grand daughter born March this year.  She absolutely loves it.  My son's wife, (the baby's mom), thinks it's great too because it is very sturdy and can be filled up giving a good depth of water.  She loves the cushioned bottom because this makes it real comfy when she is sat in there with the new baby.  Good buy for the money! - Great asset in the high Los Angeles temperatures! AND a really colorful addition to their back yard
B003RUZKC8|5.0|Just an all around fun, don't take yourself seriously type of movie.  Seen it twice now, and I'd see it again.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Like the title says... it's a cable, construction is solid, quality appears good, performs fine at it's designated function... not much more you can ask for. Thus far I have never been disappointed by an Amazon Basics cable and I own a few of them.

0743437497|4.0|I absolutely LOVED the movie. I read the book after seeing the movie and that may have been part of the problem. The movie follows the book fairly close so I had an idea of what was going to happen. I wouldn't say the book is boring..but I found more excitement in the movie. Always a great story though whether you are reading or watching it.
B002ZG997C|4.0|...we know from the start at least the main stars acting will be professional. The movie is basically about two characters, with a few others thrown in as backup. Washington is the \\"Walker\\" and has a mission. While professing to read his bible every day he goes through several scenes like River Tam in a room full of Reavers. A slaughterhouse on two legs, \\"Walker\\" wanders across the country seemingly happy to be alone and listening to his iPod. Eventually it needs a recharge so he goes into a town where main character #2, Gary Oldman, has a shabby dictatorship. (Honestly, I've never been an Oldman fan and while he does a passable job as the bad guy, an Alan Rickman would have been more effective.) Oldman shows what a baddie he is by pimping out his girlfriends (Jennifer Beal in a surprisingly effective performance) daughter played by Mila Kunis.<br /><br />Without giving away too much and spoiling the ending, when all was revealed I found myself having a \\"WTF?\\" moment, immediately followed by several \\"but then how did...\\" questions. Probably the answer to all of the questions is \\"faith\\", but still...<br /><br />Not a great movie, but not bad either. Worth buying, especially if you get it used or at a good price, worth renting certainly.
B00004T9UF|5.0|In my opinion i think this is eminem's best album,but i still love the slim shady LP.This is his best album because it's a more personal album and songs like kill you,stan and kim really stick out,and its way more raw then any other album he's ever done,next to slim shady EP which is a demo that came out before the LP.i just can feel his pain every single song i hear on this cd and its amazing!and i like how he pushes the limit with some of the stuff he talks about,and he uses his freedom of speech to the fullest to get his message across.If thats what he needs to do for people to listen to him and buy his album then so be it.this album gets the credit it deserves and i know its alittle late but iv always been a em fan and i lost my copy of this so i couldnt help myself but buy this album again!

0307702103|1.0|An avid Grisham fan, I selected the audio version of Ford County for a long solo trip thinking short stories would be perfect for travel between stops. I have never been more disappointed. Mr. Grisham's reading sapped the characters of color and depth and absolutely ruined his normally lively atories. I cannot imagine Random House allowing such a travesty by a writer of his caliber. His tone is monotonous and his phrasing stilted and sing-song at best. Why do this to wonderful stories when there are so many talented artists who can bring the pages of a book to life? It is just bad, bad, bad.
B000H305U0|5.0|Arrived faster that expected since it was an overseas order and would do business with them again.
0451219597|4.0|I really enjoyed this book for a number of reasons.  First off, i like reading or watching about anything that's about WWII and brings you up close with the horrors of war.  The story is about a woman who's a British spy and is planning to blow up a telecommunications center that the Nazi's are using in occupied France.  It's only days away from D-Day, before the Allies storm the beaches, and both the Nazi's and the British are scrambling to break the others' back.  One Nazi in particular is a professional interrogator and torturer who's tasked with destroying the French Resistance.  He's brutal and thinks only of the mission and disregards the means, but still, Follett does a great job of showing how even the most merciless Nazi's can simultaneously be rational and loving men.  It gives you a really great insight into how the Nazi ideology didn't stop people from being both loving people and monsters.  The British Agent is tasked with putting together a team of women to destroy the Nazi's comms so the Allies will be in better shape to intercept messages by the Nazis and hence make their invasion go smoother.  Only her team is a bunch of misfits who have no idea what to do.    This isn't a very emotional book, in that you won't get too angry or too sad or too happy, instead it's a good mix of love and hate and victory and terrible loss, and therefore makes for a worthy read.  Highly recommend it.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|The Proposal is what you expect: a lame setup (a Canadian executive is too busy to renew her Visa so she is being deported from the U.S.) for a mixed, read: poor, match between an obviously older Bullock and her assistant, Reynolds, that ends exactly as you would expect. There were two things that stood out to me:<br /><br />1. Sandra Bullock is getting too old for this. If she wants to continue in Romantic Comedy movies she needs to start filming with actors her age. Reynolds is way too young.<br /><br />2. Reynolds, not Bullock, is the star of this film. His timing was excellent, and in nearly every scene he shines. It's time for him to headline a movie or two.<br /><br />Date night fun, but that's it.

B001OQCV2E|4.0|Years ago, when Independence Day came out this end-of-the-world genre was mind blowing for me. Now it is what you expect from director Roland Emmerich ([[ASIN:B000WQWPKA Independence Day]], [[ASIN:B000VDDWE2 The Day After Tomorrow]], and [[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]]): paper-thin story sets up massive destruction and devastation across the world, while one small group struggles to survive. If you arent familiar with the genre this movie probably isnt for you. For the rest of us who know what to expect the movie performs well.<br /><br />Who cares about 2012? Who cares about Danny Glover or the scientist that was so important to me that I can't even remember his name? Who cares, really, about John Cusack, who after a while you start to feel that maybe he would be [[ASIN:B00005JKFA Better Off Dead]]. (I couldn't resist!) What people who watch this film care about is seeing the world get destroyed. (As an aside, I believe that Emmerich's goal is to cinematically show every major city or landmark destroyed in one his films - and I was glad to see Los Angeles get the treatment this time.)<br /><br />Get some popcorn and clear 2 hours for a complete waste of time. In a good way.

0062513346|5.0|The Valkyries continues Paulo Coelho's series of books on self-discovery, spiritual questing, love and relationships.  It is the largely autobiographical account of Coelho's quest to speak to and see his guardian angel - as facilitated by both his wife and a mysterious group of motorcycle riding women known as the Valkyries.<br /><br />The path to self discovery takes Coelho through both light and darkness, and forces him to confront his own demons as well as angels.  Only through self awareness, self-understanding, accepting forgiveness, breacking a pact and making a bet is he able to finally achieve his quest.  The common theme of balance, unity, love and acceptance is ever present in the book, as are the threads of esotericism and the occult that really weren't in the Alchemist, but are very evident here.<br /><br />A good, entertaining and enlightening read.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|\\"The Fall\\"  is an extraordinary visual feast in which the director and cinematographer have created haunting images of such beauty and power that they echo in the viewer's mind for days after.  The fairy tale plot has already been well-described by far more eloquent reviewers in earlier reviews so I won't belabor that task.  However, for me, rather than evoking comparisons to \\"Pan's Labrynth\\"  I think this movie was deeply influenced by a far older movie:  \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchhausen\\" directed by the magnificent Terry Gilliam.  That movie adopted the story within a story structure with wondrous results. \\"The Fall\\" is an overlooked masterpiece that intrigues and inspires.  Aside from its visual brilliance, the plot is painful, touching and ultimately uplifting.  The acting is superb beginning with the remarkable 5-year old Catinca Untaru and the excellent Lee Pace. \\"The Fall\\" is a hidden gem awaiting discovery by movie lovers who seek uncovential beauty.

B003EV6DBM|2.0|I've been a Who fan since I was a kid - spent the early years of my life in England and Scotland. Some of the episodes in this season and last season are the worst ever.  Putting aside that ridiculous stinker \\"Daleks in Manhattan\\", lets take a look at this season.<br /><br />A Dalek Constructed cybernetic bomb, about to destroy the Earth. The Doctor and companion convince him to remember his false memories of love.  He does. And love disarms the bomb.  Gag!  So if we extrapolate, when he discovers his love is false or is rejected, we can kiss the Earth goodbye, right?<br /><br />Same episode, propeller driven aircraft flying in the vacuum of space. Yea, right.  That's just idiotic.<br /><br />Same episode. The Daleks base their entire existence on the Doctor saying a certain phrase in the vicinity of a certain object to verify that they are actually Daleks and can be reborn. Pathetic.<br /><br />Season finale: I think the writer watched the Bill and Ted movies a few too many times.  Yes, Doctor Who, the original Time Traveler TV series, is ripping off Bill and Ted.  Oh yea, and the Doctor is saved by - Love. OH COME ON!  We've passed pathetic and moved on to brain-dead territory.<br /><br />There are just so many moments like that in Season Five that this will rank as the WORST season in the reincarnation. Doctor Who is not a CHICK FLICK! Problems are not solved by emotions, discussions and, gak, love.  There have been books written on the science behind the series.  Now they can write one on the fluff, lack of originality, and atrocious writing.<br /><br />The opening title sequence and theme music?  Amateurish, lacking any soul.

0451527712|5.0|This haunting masterpiece still reaches new readers every day. I won't go into the details of Shelly's masterpiece in this review, but deal in what I think makes this a timeless classic that hangs on to readers today.<br /><br />The character of Victor Frankenstein, a man obsessed with making a difference in the studies of life and death. It is his blind devotion to his studies over life and death, that leads to tragedy for his family and friends later in the story. Shelly takes us on a journey that shows us the frailty of our lives and the motives that drive us to achieve no matter the cost. Victor, even though he is a character, is within everyone. He is the blind ambition that throws away love for the sake of fame and immortality, and the utter lack of responsibility for his actions once the deed is done. This character is versatile, because it lingers in people, perhaps even someone you know.<br /><br />Just as haunting is Victor's creation, the Monster. Racked with questions about his identity and guilt for a life unwanted, the Monster is just as much a part of our lives as Victor. Forget about the rheumatoid Karloff of the Universal Classics, this Monster is so much more. Memories implanted by the mind or the parts of the whole, surprise Victor's creation and lead him on his journey for answers. A Monster that can speak and play music, a humbling yet violent creation asking for justification from his creator, an answer to the question: Why?<br /><br />This is a human tale.<br /><br />Yes there is drama and horror, but the human message is one that should be remembered and savored because it is a cautionary tale that tells how expendable life really is when one embarks on gaining knowledge and the frailty of the human soul when confronted by the deeds they have committed. To lose one's soul chasing after an obsession and then to seek redemption all too late.<br /><br />I know this does not cover the wealth that is Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, or Modern Prometheus, but as I have stated this review is what I think makes it a timeless classic that should be embraced by readers of all ages today.what I think makes it a timeless classic that should be embraced by readers of all ages today.

0446343129|3.0|I love this book and I've read it many times in the last twenty-seven years.  I actually am committed to not consuming sugar for the rest of my life.  That being said, the majority of William Dufty's arguments against sugar are more than fallacious, they are completely unscientific.  I've just purchased yet another copy of Sugar Blues to replace one that got lost in moving and I'm laughing out loud at how ridiculous his arguments are. Some of them include: Smoking tobacco doesn't cause cancer, it's the sugar in the cigarettes that does it.  Smoking is actually better for you than eating candy.  Eating protein or complex carbs with sugar causes \\"fermentation\\" in the GI tract, causing the formation of poisons, because digestion is solely reliant on enzymes.  Ulcers are caused by eating sugar.  Diabetes (he makes no distinction between Type I and Type II, which are completely different diseases and only share similar symptoms) can be treated (or even cured) completely by eating a macrobiotic diet of brown rice, sea vegetables, fish and umeboshi plum.  His specific anecdote of George, the boy who contracts diabetes at 15 in the 1950s (presumably a juvenile diabetic) and is cured by eating a macrobiotic diet is absurd.<br /><br />Mr. Dufty's arguments make two things clear: that he had very little in the way of a scientific education and that this book is extremely dated in what science it refers to.  Dufty has next to no understanding of how digestion takes place, no understanding that there are billions of bacteria and other organisms in the digestive system, that fermentation is a normal part of human digestion, that gastric motility has little do with sucrose.  This book was written a decade before the discovery that ulcers are caused by a bacteria called Heliobacter pylori. A more significant problem for the polemic he proposes is his lack of understanding about carbohydrates in general.  He believes that refined sugars alone are the sum evil of modernity and bizarrely believes that honey lacks all of the evils of refined sugar because it's \\"natural\\" when honey has only trace minerals and vitamins to recommend it over table sugar and contains high levels of fructose, which the body converts immediately to triglycerides.  He claims over and over that none of the problems presented by eating refined sugars are present in whole grains despite the fact that a bite of whole grain bread that is chewed up and spat on glucose detecting paper registers as having as much glucose present as eating sucrose itself and similar effects on blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Dufty's claim is that all people and diabetics especially can do well on a high carbohydrate diet consisting of whole grains, principally brown rice. The glycemic index and the last 30 years have shown that is just not the case.  Whole grains have vitamins and minerals but eventually, they all boil down nutritionally to starches and sugars and ironically, it's the USDA which Dufty labeled part of the \\"diseasestablishment\\" which is now pushing 11 servings of whole grains a day as the US population gets fatter and more diabetic every year. Dufty's obvious infatuation with Japanese culture and the macrobiotic diet explains his dietary advice.  He must not have developed much insulin resistance in his lifetime to have been able to eat that way without it affecting him badly.  The majority of us in the 21st century don't have that luxury any more.  One wonders how theories of paleolithic diet would have registered with Mr. Dufty.<br /><br />Sugar is bad for us.  All of us would be better off never eating sucrose again, without exception.  That part William Dufty got right.eves that honey lacks all of the evils of refined sugar because it's \\"natural\\" when honey has only trace minerals and vitamins to recommend it over table sugar and contains high levels of fructose, which the body converts immediately to triglycerides.

This has to be one of my all time favorite CDs (Ray Charles; Genuis Loves Company is among them. As Ray puts it after the cut with James, Sweet Potato Pie, \\"I Love It\\"). James and Carole owned the night and never sounded sweeter. I love it too Ray!

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a GREAT video!  No matter how huge or small you are, this video can help you!  Jillian combines moves to burn more calories and make it more effctive.  It only takes 25 minutes a day (but make sure you stick to it daily, or you won't get the results you're wanting).  Before I started this video, I hadn't worked out in 3 years.  In under a week, I could tell that I was quickly getting back into shape on level 1!!!!  It gives me energy to do more!!  I love the basic moves (I'm kind-of old school) and all you need is weights (any weight you are comfortable with)  I use 4lb weights.  A year ago I broke my talas bone in my ankle and I couldn't use my eliptical anymore due to the pain.  So I thought I would give this a shot and there is alot of jumping but because its not for a long period of time, so I can tolorate the pain.  I suggest this video for anyone who has had a similar injury as I have.  I am 6ft tall and significantly overweight... but I have full confidence that this video will get me to my goal.  I plan on using it well past 30 days!!!! Good luck to everyone!!!

1572814136|4.0|This was just as advertised, follows the original Rider-Waite with great precision, the added detail and 'radiance' makes for easier visualization... back of deck has a purple blue background covered in stars... I would suggest getting some kind of a special cloth to keep this shiny and fingerprint free...  as it is so shiny that I do notice that the cards pick up a lot of thumb prints, which are very visible on the back side especially... and I know how 'oily fingerprints' can become permanent if not maintained properly...  (just my thoughts)...
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Seldom do my husband & I agree on the subject matter of a movie, but we both agree that this is a classic.  We know a little about the craft of movie-making (our grandson's field) we KNOW this movie is excellent, technically.  Very pleased with the speed by which we received it.
1554072840|3.0|The drawing of the potty looks weird. It doesn't remind of the shape of the potty but that is not why I am not able to use it. My daughter is 16 months and that is the age when they still want to chew on books. Soft paper makes it impossible for us. She needs a book with all hard paper pages. The pictures are okay, even the way the potty looks could be acceptable but the paper....so anyway- if you can get that book in different paper go ahead or if you train your child late otherwise i do not recomment it
1423113381|5.0|I purchased this book for my grandchildren and decided to read it before giving it to them. I'm glad I did. I found it very entertaining and difficult to put down. I am sure my grandchildren will love it. They have read the previous series by Rick Riordan and liked it very much. I recommend it highly for the 8 to 13 age group, and possibly older. The previous series dealt with Roman gods and mythology.  This first book of a new series deals with ancient Egyptian gods and mythology. There are some words that are difficult to pronounce and some concepts that will likely require help from an adult (or some research). It has everything kids will love, action, magic, scary parts, and two kids as the heroes.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I'm never one to watch nature documentaries, but the hi-def slow motion animal shots definitely peaked my interest.  I was worried when I ordered this, honestly.  I figured it'd be something I'd pop in, shout \\"Check out the clarity!\\", and then ignore the rest.  I was wrong.  Sure, this series is a great tool for showing off how awesome your $3,000 TV is, but it's much more than that.  When I watched the first scene, where dolphins would trick fish into jumping into their hungry mouths, I knew I'd be in for a treat.  The writing, combined with David Attenborough's narration, make for a very interesting documentary that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  It's simple enough for everyone to enjoy, but sophisticated enough that you don't feel like you're being read a bedtime story (unlike Oprah's narrated version).    If you have a nice big 1080p television, or just have even a slight interest in wildlife around the world, then you'd be doing your household a favor by making this purchase.
B000FGGE68|3.0|Honestly this movie had a really good concept. The futuristic sci-fi version of vampires plus the cool action and unique effects made it really interesting by far, the only thing I didn't like about it was that she was trying to save a child. Now I understand why they did that but in all honesty a woman can fight for much more than that and the writers for this movie maybe should have given her a different drive in the plot.
030726999X|4.0|Responded to Amazon's email thinking I'd be asked to rate the seller and service. Bought used and am happy I did.<br /><br />Re the writing, I enjoyed this book more than the first one. Thought the first one was strong and compelling but had some excesses. (Although I think the film of the first book is great.) Liked the touch and balance in this one better. I read the first 70% of this one eagerly and with considerable momentum. The last 30% was fine too, but I'm peculiar in that I enjoy the characters and the assemblage of the plot and the \\"flavor\\" more than I enjoy the final resolution of the plot. Recommended.
B002WY65VU|3.0|It's no Shaun of the Dead, a film that it is clearly influenced by, but the goofy yet engaging Zombieland has a nicely off-kilter sense of humor all its own.  This is due in no small part to the comic chemistry generated between the two male leads, Jesse Eisenberg (once again playing his finely honed neurotic character type) and Woody Harrleson.  The two star as surviors of a post-apocalyptic landscape populated entirely by flesh craving zombies.  Apparetnly it was a strain of mad cow disease that resulted in the infestation.<br /><br />Eisenberg plays Colombus, the narrator of the film who also has a lenghty list of rules about how to survive amongst the undead;  rule number one is cardio.  One needs to be fit in order to outrun the zombies, you see.  The plot kicks into gear when Colombus meets up with Tallahassee (Harrelson), a booze drinking, zombie killing machine with a major Twinkie craving.  The two form an uneasy bond that gives off a nice comic glow and really puts the movie into gear.  Eventually they meet up with two sisters (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) who con them out of their vehicle and weapons.  It's not too difficult to predict that these four end up forming a family-like unit as they head to an amusement park in California, or that Colombus falls for the older sister.  What is surprising about this development is how genuine the affection between the characters feels.  They truly become like a family since they have no other human connections in the world.  There's an especially tender moment when Tallahassee lets down his guard and reveals the wounded human being behind his cocky swagger.<br /><br />But hey, let's not get too serious.  Zombieland is first and formeost a comedy and it never loses sight of that fact.  As a reminder of this, there is a teriffic cameo towards the movie's latter half that serves as the comedic high point of the film and would make Zombieland worth watching on its own.  I won't spoil the surprise for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but it is a true comic treat.  So is the rest of the movie.  It may not be as laugh out loud funny as Shaun of the Dead, but for those looking for an enjoyable road trip movie that just happens to involve flesh eating zombies, Zombieland delivers the goods.ovie, but it is a true comic treat.

B003PGNBO8|5.0|We came upon Flasforward this summer and our family loves it. We are so sad that the network canceled it and in fact, we are reading the book it was based on to get an idea of how the author resolved the story lines. Even so, the DVD is compelling and we can't wait to get the final half of the season to watch. Anyone out there in TVland listening?? Please pick up this excellent show.

B002ZG98LO|4.0|Though directed by Nimród Antal (\\"Vacancy\\"), the latest addition to the \\"Predator\\" franchise is clearly inspired or influenced by someone else - someone with creative power, I mean, the hectic, tongue-in-cheek style of producer Robert Rodriguez. Based on the old-fashioned concept of \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" the 2010 \\"Predators\\" is an unabashed action movie that opens with a man free-falling from the sky.     We know nothing about the hapless character Adrien Brody plays, or the place where he is, or other characters he soon encounters on the ground - a group, mostly warriors of some sort, also includes a doctor (Topher Grace), a death row inmate (Walton Goggins) and a Japanese yakuza gangster clad in suit (Louis Ozawa Changchien) - but most viewers already know they are there. Deep in the jungle, they are \\"being hunted\\" by the invisibly cloaked aliens, the Predators.    While the film doesn't break new ground and the story involving the hunters and the hunted is often too silly with some incredible turns of events, \\"The Predators\\" is a pretty entertaining film with a series of average action sequences. It is a standard Hollywood action movie with an ethnically diverse cast including one female sniper (Alice Braga). I think most viewers can predict who will survive and who will not.    Had this installment been directed by Rodriguez himself, things might have been a bit different. Perhaps Danny Trejo's role would have been much bigger and more importantly, the film would have been less formulaic. Still, though \\"The Predators\\" is not great, it is not bad either and I actually enjoyed watching it.

B0011ZNAIC|1.0|I don't even want to waste my time writing a review of such a ridiculous, inane movie but am doing so to (hopefully) save an hour and a half of someone else's life.  I find Seinfeld mildly amusing, but Jerry's voice was actually painful to listen to in this film, and Renee Zellweger's character was nothing more than a squawking schizophrenic mess.  The jokes were neither funny nor clever, and aside from the vibrant colors, the movie was exceedingly dull and difficult to watch.  My three year old son and I didn't even make it to the halfway point.  I'm surprised that this fruitless movie even made it to the theaters...it may have easily been one the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.
0553584537|2.0|Let me start off by saying I read Lisa Gardner's' book 'Hide' before I read 'Alone' and I absolutely loved 'Hide' so it would have been hard for any book to top it. But I thought 'Alone' would come close after I read the reviews but it didn't. This book fell very flat for me. When I was reading 'Hide' I felt connected to the story. I loved the characters and the story line and it was a complete page turner. 'Alone' wasn't. I didn't like any of the characters other then Bobby and the story line didn't really interest me. After I was finished reading and I closed the book I just felt very unsatisfied. While reading this book I never felt a emotion. Never felt surprised, sad, worried for a character, or happy for a character. I kept waiting for something to happen to pull me into the book and make me start caring but it never happened. If you want an amazing book, Skip this one and go buy 'Hide'. That was one amazing book. This one, not so much.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|Darn it! This is simply too \\"beautiful\\" to be Black Sabbath. I've never heard really catchy songs, or such well defined melodies from Sab, ever before; this is just too daring, and the band rises to meet the intensity available from fronter Tony Martin.      As stated by some, the music is sometimes too dark for consumption. I might agree that they should have proceeded with a little less of an anti-mainstream attitude (Possible exceptions: \\"Black Moon\\" and, \\"Devil and Daughter\\"). But precisely why this album is unique, is that it departs more from the \\"heavy blues\\" sound, and into more pure metal. For the most part, this is a renegade, stand alone album. Though, I should say, there are some tracks on TYR, and a few of the followers, that seek to match the level here.       Surely, the same people that won't watch anything but Marry Poppins are set to despise this. Likewise, those who are locked into the whole, \\"keyboards or singing can't ever have a place in metal,\\" may have a similar problem. But we only wanna hear guitar! Guitar, guitar! Nothing else!!! Luckily, many mature bands have incorporated good vocals, new instruments, and different styles into their musical banquet. While most other bands were busy sounding typical vocally, with either ridiculous death gurgles, or simply having a monotone, bore-all quality, Sab broke out with intensity on HC.           Both too dark for many, and too divided from their roots for others, this album stands as not only unique for Sab, but unique for any music of it's time -if for nothing more than simply having a vocalist that doesn't mumble, but conveys that elusive element in music...emotion!       One thing is sure, this great album will either make old hippies shake off the cobwebs and try to fill in their wrinkles, or it will make them complain, with a sour demeanor, that \\"things aren't like they used to be\\".        I can't look back anymore.
0132350882|5.0|I'd recommend everybody to read this book. Many good examples and practices and it's all written in a way that is easy to follow.     The most important lesson from this book is : \\"Make it testable, do an easy implementation, make it work then improve it\\". There are many good guidelines that are introduced in this book and I think that the way you think about code and about programming will change after reading this book.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|The dvd's were great the outcome not what I expected but it still ended better than most of my favorite sitcoms
0321213351|4.0|I heard a lot of praise regarding this book, so I decided to buy it.    Overall it's a good book but I was kind of hoping for something more. The author does a lot of references to \\"Refactoring\\" by Martin Fowler and to THE Design Patterns book (Gamma ...). In my view this book is more like a \\"how to understand and utilize\\" those previous two books and might increase the understanding for when to apply design patterns and when to avoid it.    I'd say that the examples used in this book is very good and they certainly do feel like non-fabricated examples. The Author's reasoning to when and how to refactor code in the examples are well described and easy to follow.    I think that if you studied Design Patterns & Refactoring and had problems understanding when or how to utilize what you learned during those books, then this book might be something for you. This might also be interesting if you wonder how to (as the title suggest) refactor towards a pattern. However, I think that where this book fails is that in a lot of situations refactoring toward patterns is to overcomplicate a code base when there are much easier solutions at hand.     Finally I'd like to say that this is certainly a good book, however I wouldn't rate it as one of those \\"must read\\"-books.  I'd much rather recommend the following books:    Clean Code - Robert C. Martin  Refactoring - Martin Fowler  Design Patterns - 4 authors : Gamma ...  The Pragmatic Programmer - Andrew Hunt and David Thomas

B002ZG981E|5.0|What a strange, fascinating, intelligent film this was. Deep, surreal, interesting and compelling, where perhaps its one fault was that it wasn't surreal enough. It's yet another extraordinary film from Christopher Nolan, who apparently can do no wrong, and it's well worth seeing at least a couple times.    Inception tells the tale of a man (Leonardo DiCaprio), and his gang (headed up by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt and Lukas Haas, bringing together three former child stars), in what amounts to a highly interesting caper film. They've been assigned to infiltrate a man's dreams, and bring him new and strange thoughts about what he should do with the corporation he will inherit when his father dies. It sounds simple enough, and follows the basic formula all such works must follow (plenty of charts and diagrams, detailed plans, scenes showing the team being assembled), but as with so many great films, the genius is in the execution.    In this case the execution takes us through several levels of a dream world intricately created by an architect (Ellen Page), and designed as a maze. The idea is that as the team goes through each level of the dream world will move closer and closer to the secrets held within the dreamer's brain. To say much more than that would give away too much of the story and the plot, and it's best to go into the film knowing as little about those elements as possible.    The film is eye-candy at its finest. You see an entire city created out of a character's mind and watch as that city folds in on itself. You get to watch a fight in a corridor that spins as the characters go at it, and later you see the same character fighting in a zero-g environment so convincing you'll start to wonder if they rented to Vomit Comet for filming, ala Apollo 13.    The direction here is also amazing, as Nolan is very much able to create several different stories taking place at several different points in time and space and manages to keep track of all of them. Even in a normal movie that's not easy to do, but in this one it shows some serious skills.    Beyond that, it's very hard for me to really review this film without giving away major plot points. But I will say this: even if you go to it and enjoy nothing about the plot, you'll at least see some sights you've never seen before, and any movie that can give you that is worth seeing.    On a purely personal side note, this is my 400th review on Amazon! These reviews helped me get into Amazon Vine and have helped me with obtaining screeners from various sources. They're also very fun to write!
B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|When I read some of the early more negative reviews I was a little worried. However, I listen to Night Train now more than Perfect Symmetry! The songs are definitely more experimentation along the lines of the aforementioned album but you can still hear the original Keane in parts, and even a matured sound in songs like 'My Shadow'. Have to admit it took a bit to grow on me but I gave it time and just can't stop with it now. From what I can gather the majority here seem to either dislike it or plain hate it, as I think they were hoping for something better after the Perfect Symmetry departure and hence have been left empty - again. I for one love Night Train, but I do hope Keane get back to their solid genuine unique sound that made them who they are.

However, the writing and performances are so GREAT that you just cannot deny that this show is addictive.  I am so looking forward to season 3 'til it's ridiculous.  I truly believe that The Linson's and Kurt Sutter will not disappoint for the 3rd. installment of SOA.  This is one FANTASTIC SHOW!!!!
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|I read a lot, and love books about India, but seriously, this book does not measure up in any way to \\"A Fine Balance\\" or \\"White Tiger.\\" The self-absorbed main character has led a colorful life (of crime, drugs, mafia, laced occasionally with healing the sick while living in the slums, befriending the poor & downtrodden) but after a while the minutiae of his days get downright tedious and annoying. Where was an editor for this?
B003PGNBO8|5.0|FlashForward is/was a revelation!  Beautifully filmed, well written and performed, compelling premise. It has it all. I will buy this DVD, but I want more of a good thing--even if it's only a short season to help tell more of the story and fill in some of the gaping holes left by a season-ending cliffhanger. No problem if the show comes back, but a huge disappointment the way it is left at this point. ABC didn't treat the show well--giving it a nearly 4 month hiatus and cutting back its promotion budget (hardly saw promos/ads for the show when it returned in March). A program like this needs time to grow and build a following, but alas ABC didn't give it the time it required. I had already hooked several people on the show when it returned (they even went out and bought the 1/2 season DVD to catch up!). I know that more would have followed for season 2 and beyond with the right marketing/promotion strategy. There are a lot of passionate FlashForward fans. Which network wants them and those that will follow? Someone, please pick up FlashForward for a mid-season launch this coming year!!!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is an incredible movie, you must get this one, tim robbins is accused of murdering his wife and is sent to shawshank prison for life, trouble is hes innocent, as red (morgan freeman) points out hey were all innocent in here. What andy dufresne (tim robbins)has to go through to survive prison life is incredible, the movie gradually builds up to a gripping climax and one hell of a supprise ending ----no iam not telling you what happens at the end but what a supprise. YES get this movie its well acted both stars play there parts really good,to the point you may think is this based on a real event?.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Read the first one first.  I liked this one better but still read the first one.  Can't wait to read the third!!!
B0009VJWSG|5.0|This has to be 1 of the top 5 fusion discs of all time.  Possibly the 2nd best, I gotta give Miles his due when he did Tribute to Jack Johnson.  Hammer was never better than when he worked on Billy's solo albums.  The MO has the finest body of work (with Billy of course)and their concerts were extraordinary in deed.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|Flashforward has been the great tv show I've ever seen! Unfortunately after the first season it got cancelled for lack of viewers or something. I have watched the whole season one and I think that the mix of drama, action, suspense and the awesome cliffhangers make this show at least the best tv show of this year. I recomend it to everyone. I really hope it gets picked up by another network!

B003FK8V7G|5.0|I have been a huge, massive Gaslight fan for a few years now.  Their sound run fairly Springsteen-punkish I like to say, with a litany of references (in sound or lyric) to everything from 50's R&B to the Cure.  But American Slang has a different feel entirely.  It honestly took me a few listens to get used to but once I did, I have grown to appreciate the variety that Gaslight can produce.  Think of the sound difference (another Springsteen reference I know) but to the sound of The Boss from the 70's into the 80's.  He changed.  Gaslight is starting to show a musical range that surpasses most bands from modern music's ability to even comprehend.  If you like Gaslight, grab American Slang!  You won't be disappointed!
1423113381|5.0|My grandson(12) loved the previous series, and grinned ear-to-ear when I gave him this.  I read it and laughed out loud at times just thinking how much he will love it.  What an imagination!  I will buy the sequels when they are published.  Recommend for kids 10-16.  I am certain my granddaughter will grab this as soon as her big brother puts it down.

B003OJBWGK|5.0|Best Coast's debut record is a lovely little scuzzy pop gem. The band has been building a substantial buzz over the last year or so with a string of underground hit singles and splits, and now they've finally unleashed their first great work to the hungry masses. Best Coast, as the name implies, is a beach-inspired pop outfit, blending fuzzy melodies and simple, lovelorn lyrics to great effect. Crazy For You recalls the kind of heartsick feelings of teenage years, a simpler and more powerful time that we all long for again at some point.<br /><br />The album is short, but it's somewhat a boon, because this is music that could easily outstay its welcome. A 50+ minute album of fuzzy pop songs is inevitably going to lose its punch after awhile, so it was wise of the band to keep the album short and sweet. One of the more disappointing elements of the album is the reuse of a number of those aforementioned singles, which isn't uncommon, but given the time the band has been working on this record, I was hoping for a brand new set of songs. Nonetheless, the singles have been reworked and sharpened to a finer edge, and the album is truly a testament to razor-sharp love songs. The lyrics may not be the deepest you'll ever hear, but they're heartfelt and powerful in context of this collection of uptempo pop songs.<br /><br />Best Coast has been regarded through this year as a band to watch, and Crazy For You does not disappoint. A great album for any fan of noise and pop and any combination thereof.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie, aside from its excellent cinematography, is extremely informative in the way it speaks to us about Multi-National Corporations and governments and their evil, corrupt, and criminal behavior and their disrespect towards other life forms, other people and cultures, unlike European ones.  People really to contemplate upon the dialogue in this movie a whole lot more than usual. There is a lesson here for those willing to listen. This is too much like what has transpired on this planet and continues to transpire in real life, on this planet. Great movie. Five stars.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Finding this certain HK is a rare and after purchasing it. It was delivered sooner then I expected it!!! That was great service and a speedy delivery!!!

This was a great buy and great service!!!
B0015HOFZI|1.0|I bought this turntable at a big box store a few months ago. It took a little getting used to as the directions are not great. I have not been able to get the software to correctly identify the separate tracks from albums, so it involves a lot of manual work to separate the individual songs. Then I realized when I played the songs back on my iPod that the digital file did not reproduce the stereo quality correctly so one channel is muffled. This is really annoying, and consequently the turntable is useless for what I wanted to do (i.e., copy my albums to digital). Basically this thing was a waste of $150!
0132350882|5.0|This book is far better then I expected. Much more in depth and looking at real codeing problems and shows great ways to solve them.  Excelent book there should be more like this one out there :)
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|The concert is unbelievable!  This edition has an excellent image quality and awesome audio. The concert itself is a \\"must have\\" and this Bluray is incredible.  Extras are cool, like Brian May and Roger Taylor comments.    Mr. Mercury and his powerful voice and performance, Queen's pioneer light show, songs carefully selected, stunning performances, etc...    Updating after a year, I can say that I play this Bluray minimum once a month!       God save the Queen!!!
B00005JKCH|5.0|I really enjoyed this widescreen movie plus great entertainment of action. I think it's well balanced story for many movie fans especially for spider-man fans,of course!
B003OF3R0S|5.0|(Credit goes to Aaron Titan from 411mania for review)If you're a fan of Avenged Sevenfold, Nightmare is a must-have for you, and immediately! If you didn't like this band before, this one MAY change your mind, but you've gotta' come into the listening experience with an open opinion about A7X. As a fan of this band, I loved this album and feel it is their best work to date. If Avenged Sevenfold can continue to heal and find a permanent drummer sometime down the line - Mike Portnoy is a great choice if that stars can align for that to happen - I see them becoming one of the elite hard rock/metal (what's in a label anyways?) acts of this era. This album is incredibly moving and is better than any tribute to the late Rev I could have possibly imagined. I gave this album a very high rating because of how moved I was by its content, songwriting, and just the truly amazing performances of everyone in the band. I will hold this album dear to my heart for a long time and think many other fans will as well.    (Me)This short review sums up exactly how i feel about this album.  The only complaint that i have (and it's a small one)is the pacing of the album.  It really seems like all the heavier songs are at the beginning and the balleds are at the end.  This album really does have something for everyone, and i highly recommend it.
0307266303|4.0|Aside from being a very fun read, this book has grown to cult following status.  Obviously barefoot running was around before this book came out, but due to the huge hype and attention given to Chris and his best-seller, the barefoot running movement has moved into the mainstream.  Today Show, NY Times, etc.  Now, I don't know if this was Mr. McDougall's intention but it worked.  I even saw a Tarahumara cookbook online the other day!<br />As far as the book goes, content wise I really enjoyed the story of his adventures with the tribe and the insight into a completely different lifestyle.  The way the book went back and forth between story and science was seamless.  Especially interesting was the section on WHY we are \\"Born to Run\\" and the theory of us vs other animals running \\"style\\"  (Slow and steady wins the race, and gets the food :))<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all runners, especially if you have ever run a marathon or are considering it.  It is inspirational and humbling.<br /><br />When is the follow up book coming out!?<br /><br />-Chad<br />Brooklyn Running

B002VECLVO|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie.  I am a fan of Colin Firth, and read all the great reviews on Amazon.  However, this film just left me cold.    A Single Man is undeniably lovely to look at, with every shot composed like a still art photo.  There is a lot of symbolism about the main character, a college English Professor, being \\"invisible\\" - he lives in a glass-walled house, yet no one seems to notice him very much.  Perhaps a commentary not only on his empty life but also on being a gay man in the 1960s.    However, for some reason this film just never made an emotional connection for me.  I found the scene where the Professor gets some devastating news over the phone to be very affecting (and Colin Firth plays this scene beautifully), but that was probably the only truly emotional scene in the movie.  The rest felt very cold and distant.    The supporting characters did not seem to add very much.  Julianne Moore's character was a self-pitying former beauty who was now divorced and lonely.  I also found the character of the young student/possible love interest to be very off-putting.  I'm not sure if it was the actor who played him, or just the way the part was written.  I think he was supposed to be earnest and wide-eyed, but he came off very stilted and a little creepy and stalker-ish.  For a moment I actually thought there may be some twist where the student turned out to be a con artist or something.  The whole relationship, and their conversations, seemed very forced and strange.    I also felt that the movie was a little pretentious in its style.  For example, a flashback to the Professor and his old lover was filmed in bright black and white while they were laying on the rocks in some desert landscape.  It came off like a Calvin Kline ad.  It seemed calculated to be \\"artsy\\" and all it did was take the viewer out of the movie.    All in all, disappointing and slow in this movie fan's opinion.
B00009R86L|4.0|We use (and love) the [[ASIN:B001DCYRH6 Hoover Commercial Portapower Vacuum Cleaner]], except that the strap is a bit minimalist, and we wear the vacuum with the strap across the chest to the opposite shoulder, and the strap would rub/chafe at the neck.<br /><br />We tried using a guitar strap pad, but that was too big and bulky, and we eventually found this shoulder strap, which works great.  It's very comfortable to wear and feels well put together.<br /><br />My only complaint is that although this pad appears to be designed such that the strap can slide through it, we find that the strap doesn't move easily and when we bend over or reposition the vacuum.  As the vacuum moves around it sometimes results in the pad moving off of our shoulder rather than the strap sliding through the pad while the pad remains in place.  However, overall we still love this shoulder pad.
B003LXM1RS|5.0|As good or better than their first album and decidedly better than \\"Ta-Dah\\" (though, it did have merit) -- \\"Night Work\\" is the SSs again giving us their best!
B00005OCMR|5.0|I haven't actually watched the movie yet, but it appears to be new, sealed in it package and looks good.  It will be nice to have the 20th Anniversary of Tron, with the new Tron movie coming out in December.
0452286751|5.0|I am currently listening to this on audio and its pretty good. My brother is an architect and it took me while to get into it because i am not but after i started tuning into it, its hard NOT to get into it and i soon started requesting he put it on. havent gotten through but about 10 hours f it but is pretty good and i would wholeheartedly recommend it. even the 12 year old is listening to it.
0307454541|3.0|After several friends raved about this, I guess my expectations were too high.  There is way too much exposition; overly-detailed descriptions of backstory; and enough not-very-subtle clues that the solution jumps out at the reader half way through.  It is however an interesting look at a culture very different from America's, and one that we tend perhaps to admire a little too uncritically.  (Also: for readers with PTSD or abuse backgrounds, there are a whole lot of triggers in this book.  Just sayin'.)
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is a great album, the best since Eminem Show. I would highly recommend it and be sure to listen to the lyrics his verses are sick.
B003RV43X4|1.0|They might as well remake \\"The Godfather\\" and cast the Jonas brothers in the lead roles. Just slap a few million $ worth of CGI on it and break out the 3D glasses! Hell, just remake Avatar already!          *Warning: Do not use if you have herpes viral infection of the eyeball.
141694737X|5.0|My daughter adores this book.  She will sit in our lap and \\"read\\" it over and over, and she has mastered the flip up pages.  She waits long enough for me to make the sound of the animal before she turns the page, so it's really fun to read together.  I've also found her \\"reading\\" it herself, babbling as she opens each animal cage.  The story is very cute and the book has handled wear and tear very well so far.  Our daughter started getting into this book around 9 months, and she is almost 14 months now.  I highly recommend it and just bought it as a present for her 11 month old nephew.
0446615641|5.0|Very pleased with the condition of book.  Prompt in delivery.  Will by again from this seller.
B003J27WFW|5.0|If you are a true Rush fan you will really Love this, it gives back history and shows that these 3 guys are truly Rock Gods that don't get the glory and praise that they desirve. After all this time they can still write and preform truly outstanding,meaningful music that will just kick your ass, They have infulinced rock music more than most and yet the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame still won't see how truly outstanding they are, maybe they should watch this DVD.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|I watched this on the Amazon.com rental because I'm impatient like that. I plan on purchasing the movie now that it's available on DVD. Overall, this is a very dark Batman story, but not without some fun, and some great visuals.    As I mentioned, the story itself is very dark. The movie opens with the death of the second Robin. From there, we go five years into the future where Batman is still protecting Gotham, but by himself. A vigilante named Red Hood has appeared on the scene and is stirring up trouble the criminal territory that Black Mask owns. Batman and Nightwing, the first Robin, head out to investigate this new vigilante, and end up on a chase around Gotham to discover his identity. Added into the mix is the Joker, who is causing mayhem as usual, and Ra's Al Ghul, who has more to do with the Red Hood than anyone would have guessed.    Others have said this, and I agree, that this feels very remiscent of \\"Batman: The Animated Series,\\" which is definitely a good thing. Batman is dark and troubled by the death of his partner, which has stuck with him after all these years. Nightwing is only in the first half of the movie, but he's perfect as the good-natured, somewhat happy-go-lucky hero who has graduated from the role of Robin. The team-up between him and Batman in the beginning is a lot of fun. Black Mask is fun to watch as the eccentric, increasingly aggitated crime boss who just wants Red Hood dead. The Joker was also a good mix of lunatic and sinister. I was reminded of both the Batman: Animated Series Joker, and the Dark Knight's portrayal, with more of the former. Ra's Al Ghul also has a small role, but comes off very mysterious, and almost morose. I usually don't care for his charcter, but I actually did not mind him in this movie.    The movie in filled with many flashbacks, which are very effective for the storytelling. A lot of them are location-triggered, which adds to the memory effect. The movie ends on a somewhat strange note, leaving me feeling a bit empty. I think it can be interpereted either positively or negatively, depending on how you look at it, which might have been the intention.    All-in-all, I enjoyed this movie very much, and reccomend it for anyone looking for something similar to the Animated series, or just a good Batman movie. The violence in this movie is rather high for an animated feature (note the PG-13 rating), however, so I would not reccomend this film for children. There is blood, explosions, and deaths. The opening scene involves the Joker beating Robin with a crowbar, if that's any indication of the violence level. It's not gory or extremely explicit, but it's definitely not your standard Cartoon Network-level violence.
0061438294|5.0|This is a great book for people who wish to disect the behaviors of people while in stressful and non stressful situations. It is balanced (Navarro constantly avoids arrogantly analyzing humans, for the sake of clarity and accuracy) and is a quick page-turner. Joe and Marvin have obviously done some homework.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|Great entertainment, excellent cast, very different for today. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, definately a feel good movie. I'M Usually not abig musical type fan but this movie had the right mix of everything. Amanda Seyfried is radiant and good at whatever she does, and definately a great looking young lady. Very good cast arround her. i'm also a fan of Abba.
B003OF3R0S|3.0|I loved their self-titled album because M Shadows had stopped screaming and it seemed like Vengeance and Gates had reached an excellent balance between solid riffs and roller-coaster through hell solos.  Along with this, everyone had vocals on the album and it seemed to have a political message that differed from the status quo.  This album isn't spontaneous like the others and is absolutely linear.  Not once was I surprised at what a song evolved into on \\"Nightmare\\".  I remember the magic of \\"Gunslinger\\" where the song just exploded.  There's nothing even close to that on this album.  A few songs have become catchy to me (Nightmare, Buried Alive, and God Hates Us) but the rest don't seem to evoke the passion that was once exhibited by the band.  I'm sure the album will grow on me and I'll learn to appreciate the intricacies of it, but after about 5 runs through it, there's not much to be excited about.

B001HN69B8|3.0|Directed by: Terry Gilliam  Stars: Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp  Running time: 122 min. PG 13 - 2009    Despite never partaking in illegal narcotics in my life, I am guessing a little while viewing would have helped me understand this film. This movie is most famous for being actor Heath Ledger's last film before he died. The visuals are very stunning and the music is outstanding. The plot? From what I could tell, a traveling theater group run by the immortal Doctor Parnassus must try to out smart the Devil who is after Parnassus's daughter. Ledger,along with Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law all playing the same role try to help the Doctor right many of the wrongs of his past. Mini-me is in it too. This movie is not for everyone, especially sober people.     Huh?
B002HEWN98|5.0|I would recommend these Terra Fi-3 sandals to all out doors folk for they dry quickly and are very comfortable, although the inner sole is perhaps a little harder than their predecessors. After some time and wear they probably will begin to smell particularly on hot and humid days, this is not unusual for any rubber sandal and one has to learn they need to be cleaned and washed periodically and this does not hurt any one to do do. The Terra Fi3 is suitable for me, I still claim they are very good for going in and out of water such as rivers and streams frequently.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|Directed by: Duncan Jones  Starring: Sam Rockwell, Kevin Spacey  Running time: 97 min. R - 2009    The film \\"Moon\\" is sci fi psychological thriller that stars Sam Rockwell who has been contracted to work on the moon for three years. Along with a super computer (voiced by Kevin Spacey) Sam slowly becomes aware that his mission isn't what it seems to be. This movie offers enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of you seat throughout despite the minimal cast. I definitely recommend this film and its worth a rental.    Good.
1416589473|5.0|This book is very engaging. You don't want to put the book down. You don't have to play Guild Wars to understand the book, but it does give you a better feel if you've played the game. The book takes place between Guild Wars 1 and GW 2. There will be 2 more books to follow, and I hope they are just as good, if not better than this one.         I recommend this book to any Lord of the Rings fan, Sword of Truth, Stormbreaker, sci-fi, fantasy, action fan. This book will keep you reading until the end. I couldn't put the book down.          I recommend this book.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Directed by: Ivan Reitman   Starring: Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd.  Running Time: 1 hr 45 mins 1984    The movie Ghostbusters premiered over 25 years ago and watching it for the first time since its VHS release I have to say it still stands the test of time. Bill Murray is at his finest and the subtle humor I missed as a kid is even more humorous today. I also really liked the music, it added a lot to the movie.    I viewed the movie as part of the Ghostbusters 2 Disc Gift Set which looked really good upscaled. Watching some of the extras it became clear that Dan Aykroyd has become a strange man.    I may have seen Ghostbusters as a kid, but now I have enjoyed it as an adult. I highly recommend seeing it again.
034544678X|5.0|This is a remarkable book as a dog trainer and behaviorist I enjoyed reading this book. Patricia has over 20 years of experience and talks about how we act when we are with our dogs and how we should act around them. It helps you to connect and know your dog on a better level of understanding them as their own specie.    To often we want to act like humans around our dogs and expect them to act the way we want them too. This book is to help us see how they see us. What a great read indeed.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|Directed by: Carlos Saldanha  Starring: Ray Romano, Denis Leary  Running time: 94 min. PG - 2009    As someone who is at home with three kids I have to watch a lot of children's programming and that includes movies. Some are bad, some are tolerable and others are actually good. The movie \\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\" falls into the latter category. Ray Romano and the rest of the cast return for the third entry in the \\"Ice Age\\" series as the mammoths are expecting a baby along with discovering dinosaurs in the lost world.The movie is highly entertaining for kids as well as adults. Simon Pegg plays a weasel who steals the show. The scenes with Scrat and the acorn seem a bit drawn out but still funny. I recommend this movie especially if you have kids and even as an adult you will enjoy it.    Just fun.
B0039M3RH4|5.0|This rare and beautiful film, based on a book that is felt as much as read, transcends the medium to become art. Painted on a vast desert canvas with deep rich oils, its beauty is felt as much as seen. This film will find your heart and remain there forever. If love had a face, it would look like this.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella's screenplay shifts the center of Michael Ondaatje's story slightly in order to capture on film the essence of his beautiful prose. Ondaatje's novel is one of poetic beauty, a potrait of a rose beneath the water's surface. The film brings that beautiful rose out of the water and into the sunlight. The book and the film are so deeply intertwined you can not watch this film without wanting to read the book, nor can you read the book without wanting to see the film. The story itself centers around three people either in love with, or haunted by ghosts they have loved and lost to war.<br /><br />Juliette Binoche gives an Oscar winning performance as Hana, a kind nurse with a gentle spirit but a damaged heart. She latches onto the burned and charred body of a man known only as the English patient, and ends up caring for him in a shell ravaged Italian villa in Tuscany where she feeds him plums and reads to him. When a man named Caravaggio with scars of his own arrives, the mystery of who the English patient really is begins to unfold via flashbacks. In the present, Hana begins to let her heart heal when she falls in love with a Sikh who disarms bombs left by the Germans.<br /><br />It is the memories of the English patient, however, which are at the heart of this film. Ralph Fiennes gives a subtle performance as the introspective Almasy, part of an international expedition mapping an unending desert with both the romance, and the danger of the sea. Kristin Scott Thomas is wonderful as Katherine Clifton, the stunningly beautiful and enigmatic wife of a fellow mapper. An instant but unspoken attraction between she and Almasy finally becomes too unbearable to ignore and the affair that holds the key to the mystery surrounding the English patient begins.<br /><br />This is one of the most romantic films ever made and is filled with the joy and anguish of love and war. It shows that while war may create logistical lines that can not be crossed, the heart has no boundaries. Anyone who has ever experienced a love of such emotional intensity and physical longing that love and need became one will understand the love affair of Katherine and Almasy.<br /><br />Cinematographer John Seale has given this film a grace and beauty seldom seen on film. A haunting score full of mystery and romance from Gabriel Yard accompany scenes never to be forgotten, and will not be described here in case you have not yet seen them. Director Anthony Minghella explores the mystery of the desert, and the heart, which according to the \\"The Histories\\" by Herodotus, a book the English patient clings to, is an organ of fire. If there is but one ounce of romance in your soul, you will love this meticulously charted and romantic map of the human heart, as wide and treacherous as the unending desert.

B002UZCJP2|3.0|Directed by: Jonathan Mostow  Starring: Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames  Running time: 89 min. PG-13 - 2009    What if you never had to leave the safety of your own home but still got to experience every day life through a robot? The answer, along with certain problems that arise, is the plot to this movie. Once again Bruce Willis does a fine job as a detective who has to figure out who it targeting the surrogates. The movie, which is based on a graphic novel, errierly depicts what society would be like without face to face interaction and the problems it causes. Surrogates is sci-fi action flick with a twist of drama.     See it.
0714843377|1.0|Maybe it's supposed to be some kind of joke, but this isn't the world's best selling book. Not even close.

B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Directed by: Zack Snyder  Starring: Gerald Butler  Running time: 117 min. R - 2007    In 2007 I saw the film \\"300\\" at the theater and it quickly became one of my all time favorites and now watching it in HD only solidifies my opinion of the film. It is great. The movie is based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller and was filmed to match closely with the comic book. Gerald Bulter plays the character of King Leonidas, who leads 300 Spartans into battle against a Persian army of millions and the \\"God-King\\" Xerxes. The film is very graphic, but done in way that doesn't detract from the story. This is very much a guy flick, but is worth a watch for almost anyone.    Own it!
0312330537|5.0|I loved this book. You really get to know the characters as if they were friends of yours or a close neighbor. I love the way the author described India as if it was always born from his heart. And you can tell he really loved the characters. I have to wonder though, is this book really about the author or someone he made up based on his own life? I think it's about him and he just changed a few things around. (smiles) Either way the book was amazing.
0312370849|3.0|I learned a lot reading this novel, but it was very bland. Like other readers, I found myself skipping Julia's chapters to get back to Sarah's story.     I understand how the author used Julia to compare her problems to Sarah's, but I felt it was too contrived. I really don't care about Julia. AT ALL.    If this was just about Sarah and in her point-of-view (or perhaps the others around her) my review would probably be different. The author does have the skills of writing as was evidenced in the chapters about Sarah. I just think that bringing in Julia added an element that wasn't so interesting.    People say that it's a great book and it won awards by Holocaust organizations and Jewish organizations, but just because it's about the Holocaust, doesn't mean that it has to win awards. I appreciate that it did enlighten me and probably a lot of other people about France's role in the extermination of innocent people, but does that make literature? We ARE talking about literature, right?
B003D83DPA|5.0|I just don't believe that.I bought a machine just to transfer alchemy from VHS to DVD.That was a dream having that concert on dvd and was wondering why the company did not release it on dvd format.I watched that concert more than 100 times along with deep purple's Made In Japan.I'm so so very happy that i'll watch it on DVD even better on Blu-ray.I still can't believe  it.Great Great job.Thanks a million for whoever made my dream to come true.But let me tell you guys,this dvd is not blu-ray.what the company did to make money,made the dvd too grainy to cheat the buyers.The picture is absolutely annoying.  For those who had comment on my review I should say that I didn't know that.I'll appreciate if someone help me
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I'm a huge Batman fan and only read part of the series that this animated movie is based on. The animation is great. The voice actors work. And I really didn't find a lot of holes in the story that left me feeling like \\"what were they thinking?\\" I can see some areas where they deviated from the typical Batman mythos, but could understand why needed to do it for story containment.    Its dark. Its a bit violent for young kids, but I think any Batman fan is going to enjoy it.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|The book is a seemless mix of historic facts and fictional characters. Knowing about France and her treatment of the Jews during WWII, the plot was not a surprise. However, the step by step getting to the plot and the aftermath is the true journey of this book. The author's skillful blending of character development and historic facts leaves the reader sometimes forgeting the difference.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you like amazing music and witty writing this is the musical for you. The hilarious and amazing voices of the cast will keep you watching it over and over. I know I do.
B003D83DPA|5.0|this blu ray was what we were expecting for!!...the concert is perfect, of course, the quality of the image is old, but the sound is better than any other Dire Straits's dvd.  We loved it!
