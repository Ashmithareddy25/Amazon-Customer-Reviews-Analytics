B004LWZWGK|4.0|A great ending to the Batman Trilogy by Christopher Nolan.  Bane was a little hard to understand at times.<br /><br />Will be fun to watch all 3 back-to-back!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This Blu-ray Disc  is a must have love this movie beautiful color never a dug moment plenty of excitement all the way thru
B003TSEEDY|5.0|captured the essence of kids coming of age; beautifully written; keen insight into hearts and minds of teens; you will care about these characters and worry about them
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very enjoyable and easy read. The structure of writing was much different than I had expected. A book that will make you want to sit and think.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I really love this movie and Emmy Rossum did a wonderful job playing Christine Daae... very moving, and it was totally awesome!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|It was a gift and the person loved it. Easier then going to the stores to find it , in the comfort of your home.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I really love this app it was so fun trying the different songs but I am still learning to play it but I know some people whom will help me so I am glad I found this app!!! :)
B000PHN4HE|3.0|I remember this was the last movie I ever watched with my Dad before he died.  I guess that was the sentimental attachment and why I decided to get it, but was APPALLED at the filthy language! It's such a cute movie why do they but all the garbage in?  Won't be watching this with my child.
0765325950|5.0|I actually have not read the book, although I'm ordering it right now.  I'm just really happy that it's available in hardcover so I figured a 5 star review would be appropriate.
B005C9YZIW|1.0|This series should be labeled 'the ultimate guide to pornography of the animal world'.  Skip it and see the world with your own eyes.  I have a DSLR camera, and when I take pictures of animals, I am not interested in their mating rituals.<br /><br />Blu ray picture quality - 5 out of 5 stars,<br />The series - take away 4 stars.<br />You do the math.<br /><br />Will be getting rid of this item soon.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|The cast for this film worked together so naturally, this was a great movie. Once in a blue moon does a movie this good come around.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's a nice combo of angry birds in gravity with some of the nice new features with the gravity wells in the space version of the popular game app. Licensed for Star Wars and with some creative new birds and enemies it continues to be entertaining. It's mindless fun and that is good from time to time. I won't say I can play for hours at end, but for 10 minutes when needed it is good clean fun.
B005LJETYI|5.0|This is a great book and I really enjoyed it.  Time-travel is a trope that so few authors get right.  This was a great fast paced read.  It'll be interesting to see how the Tom Cruise film compares.
B00ARAN9JW|5.0|Another installment of Resident Evil...Formulaic... predictable... Nonetheless - always fun shoot-em-up zombie thrill-ride with an evil corporation at the center of it all. Other reviews will hit on the pros and cons of the plot and the quality of the digital transfer to blu-ray or whatever. For me it gets a 5-star rating because it was a fun movie to watch, had great effects, and Milla still rocks the skin-tight zombie slayer garb!
B007ME5BUG|4.0|This is a long book which I am plodding through, but I am glad I bought it and sticking with it. Great history of the Second World war to add to my knowledge of the times.
B009JBZH54|5.0|There are more technical reviews that discuss the nature of the video and audio transfer to blu-ray, etc. This purchase for me was based on the fact that I liked the movies, planned on buying the trilogy, and it happened to be a good price for a bundled set. The price point may fluctuate and perhaps timing is of some import, but at the time, the cost and the bundle made it worth the investment to add this set of movies to my collection. The video and audio quality were fine for my viewing (no complaints).
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We really like the creative writing and characters of this show. Just a lot of fun. A great way to relax after a long day.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Okay, no doubt people will have their own opinions as to whether the acting is quality from the stars in this film. You get a great performance from Charlize Theron, as the queen Revena she is wicked and vane, and all the other qualities you would expect. Oscar worthy? Meh, maybe not, but for the genre she does hit is out of the park (or poisoned forest if you prefer). Chris Hemsworth plays the part he's dealt and at the level that he can act... And of course our special case of Kristen Stewart gets the rasberry nod for her performance... I liked the parts where the director clearly told her to stand there, look pretty, and keep your mouth shut... Okay the acting was what it was, the story was what it was...<br /><br />The visuals and overall impact of the movie is solid. It has action, it has drama, it has humor, it has evil, and it has good conquering all at the right time. The audio track is rich and the foley artists clearly rock this movie! On my best day this movie cannot earn that ellusive 5 stars, but it was a fun to watch film with great effects and overall impact. And, if you like the new release of the classic fairy-tale stories with the darker twists, this should be one to add to the list and your collection.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and the right amount of difficulty for a challenging great time. I highly recommended this game to everyone looking for an action back hack and slash game.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|If you've not seen the movie - it's a no-brainer to rent or buy it's a great film and wonderfully animated. It has all the formulaic elements needed to make it enjoyable for the kids and watchable for the adults. The story is rich and the message is authentic.<br /><br />Flawless reproduction in visual and sound. Love it!
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|Yet again Tom Hardy's acting is superb. I have not been disappointed by his work yet...watch Bronson, he is AMAZING in that one which is a true story. An added benefit is that he is pretty dang handsome. I would take him on as a second husband if my husband let me :-)
B002I0J5FG|4.0|i played both games LOVED THEm.  had to read in depth wiki's to find out what the hell everything meant.  i guess good job sony,  hopefully the last guardian comes out so we get another chapter of this bat s*** crazy story.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I swear I put this song on every morning to start my day. It is just such an upbeat happy sounding song. My kids love it as well!
0393343405|5.0|Absolutely essential for an understanding of what it means to be an informed and enlightened Pagan in the world since 500BC
B00004RFFS|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this move. Great cast with great acting and a wonderful story line. Kristen Dunst was an amazing child actor.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|This was one of the best feel-good movies I have seen in a long time & mostly because of the great music! There are a few actors singing that should definitely stick to acting but almost all of the songs are amazing & bring back lots of great memories from the 80s. Very highly recommended!!
B008FRFN7A|3.0|I specifically bought the HP7520 printer to get the web-enabled printing feature.  The printer has it's own email address via HP's server.  This app enables printing from the mobile device to the HP printer via HP's server.  It''s the best I've seen of this category of printer app, but I think what's missing is a print spooler in the Kindle device to share this app with all potentially printing apps on the device.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Not too difficult so was a game that you could play relaxingly. Good story line. Creepy graphics looked great. Look forward to a sequel.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|This app itself runs fine, but I haven't figured out where it hides my PDF files on the Kindle.  It seems to have it's own hidden directory.  I recommend the Android File Transfer app for connecting your Kindle to another PC just so you can organize, add and delete files.  There is no feature to enable printing of a PDF doc.  I expected a connection to HP's ePrint App, but there is none.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I've only gotten to chap 4, but it is the most boring book...<br />I downloaded a Scarpetta novel and am enjoying it....
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The screen images are brilliant.  The weather is presented in a highly intelligent manner so I know what is going on and more importantly, what is going to happen next!  Bravo!
B00APUYWYA|2.0|.  Seems as though I've seen this movie.  Hollywood stamps these out like the New York mint pumps out quarters.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This is a sorry implementation of the mighty search engine.  I uninstalled it.  The Kindle itself provides a search capability which is superior to this app.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|the best series i have read in a long time. Not very complex, and the players are only partially developed but i was hooked.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|I don't know why apps are implemented differently on every platform, but this implement is inferior to the iPad version.  Even the Windows 8 version implemented for the Nokia phone runs much better.  Image handling is particularly deficient.  On the iPad version the user can display a search as a screen filling touch sensitive matrix of photos from listed items.  This app only gives a text listing with tiny images to the left.
B0079R8KXG|3.0|I was so anxious to receive this cover as I'm leaving town for 6 weeks......but I can't get my Kindle in! Checked the web site and yes, it is for a Kindle Fire, 7&#34; HD, but so far, it's not working for me.  Following directions, and pressing on the bottom, the clips do not snap in place.....the Kindle pops out.  Suggestions???
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I admit, I have heard about this book for years but never picked it up.  There was always one more book in some other series or trilogy that I was reading and this one got further and further down the &#34;must read&#34; list.  Then I saw the trailer for the movie and thought, &#34;Oh no, I have to read the REAL story before this movie comes out.&#34;  So I bought the book.<br /><br />I loved it though it wasn't what I was expecting.  The style of the writing threw me off a little and I rated at this level because overall, the style just wasn't something I was expecting and that's more on me than the book, but a review is about what &#34;I&#34; think.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people who enjoy the genre and who are looking for something a little outside the box.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I enjoy Mahjong, find the computer games boring, and this little better.  However, when passing time, it works to keep the mind occupied, that's why I rated it only 3.
B00632HWOG|5.0|So far it is working well for me --- no problems.  I was glad it transferred all the contacts I had.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Downboaded to read on a trip.  Haven't started yet, but look forward to this &#34;classic&#34;!  Unread, I gave it a 3, which is probably low.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was fantastic. It kept you guessing right until the end! Gillian Flynn is a great author and her style of writing keeps you on your toes and wanting to know more. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!
B0018RFLN0|4.0|Great action, awesome plot. I really enjoyed the twists and turns. The cast was well chosen. Love streaming from amazon!
B00884GR0W|1.0|Some instructions would be nice for people who have never played the game before. A 3 second tutorial does not constitute instructions.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great fun game that teaches u about life and you can have many fun species of Dragons. Also they have Holliday bonus Dragons.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I can relate to both of the main characters and realized the silver linings exist even where you least expect them.
B000I8HIR2|3.0|The movie felt longer then it was and did what it was supposed to do. Which was to scare my girlfriend.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I caught them on Ellen and downloaded it right away. I haven't replayed many songs repeatedly like I do these since the days of lifting the needle over and over! Great mix of fun, intelligence and heart.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|the storyline was marvelous,but theres too much GRAPHIC GRATUITOUS sex for my taste.The reader  would be wise to keep a written account of the characters as they are introduced.It will definitely help as the story developes.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Literally, this is one of the best movies in the past year.  I was expecting something just sort of fun and easy to watch.  But was not prepared for the writers to close the book on the characters in such a way that if you were not moved at least a little, you may not have a brain in your head.  Great movie... would recommend.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|I liked the animation with the beautiful settings but the story line is a bit absurd and made me think it wasn't worth watching it in its entirety.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love the game. its a great time consumer and gives me something to do in downtime around the house when everyones gone.
B007SGM084|4.0|I loved these books they were great I would like for you to right another book for this series. Now that I am done reading them I don't know what I am going to read
0307592731|4.0|&#34;Wild&#34; met all my expectations and then some.  I enjoyed the way Cheryl Strayed described the Pacific Crestr Trail and wished I could hike it.  My memories of the eastern Sierras kept me reading her account hoping to find familiar areas.  She gained so much insight into herself and was able to share it in this interesting book,  Hopefully, this book could provide  theraputic assistance to others who have been lost.  I have already shared the book with a good friend who loves to hike and is interested in the lhuman condition.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is full of suspense and makes you cautious about how you treat others. This book has taught me to be..more aware of the  environment around me.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Love this DVD it is very informative and interesting and wonderfully made. The direction and beauty of the landscapes are amazingly shot. And of the stories told of Bob Marley&#34;s life were extremely delightful. I have told others of this DVD in hopes that they will also keep a copy of this excellent production.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I rate The Son of Neptune 5 stars because it has perfect pacing of the time event and it has details that make the story come alive.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find the graphics so smooth they don't interfere with the game.  It is a pleasure to to make it part of my game rotation.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I love it! Quick 10 minutes every day, done. And its gret that it gives you a little bit of everything.
0316286443|5.0|If you want your face done correctly then this is the book for you. Great examples of different styles. Worth the investment.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|This is the official app for accessing Steam, and it does the job perfectly.  You can browse the store and message friends.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|Excellent Album, as usual, Pitbull's blends of artist makes this a good record! I like pretty much all the songs. Well done Mr. 305!
0446554995|5.0|This is a great series. Love the Pendergast saga.<br />Will continue to read the. The authors have a winning combinatio.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It sounds that you can't really play unless you connect to a social network (even though it says you don't have to) and you need lots of friends to do half the stuff.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Buy Bones Season evey year. Reciepient very happy with another<br />season. Will be back next year for Season 8. Thanks.
034580404X|5.0|This is a great book. It really opens up your eyes about your sex life. Gives you new ideas.. Its a must read..
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book!!!! It's so amazing! I would recommend it to any young reader,like myself, to read the series
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book!!!!!!!!  It's a must read! The book kept me on my toes the whole time. Nicholas Sparks is a great author.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great read! I never expected to get into a book set like this, but I could nit stop reading!  I wish it weren't a trilogy - I'd love to read more!
B001LPWGE6|5.0|What a difference blueray makes.  I have these on DVD and decided to give a gift to myself.  Much better on bluray any day!!
B00968THRE|5.0|She is one of the best singers I have listened to recently. This album is particularly awesome. All songs are great. Loved buying it.
0393343405|5.0|A lost poem, filled with the philosophies of Epicurean thought, not known to civilization for nearly 1000 years, is found by an Italian scholar and makes its way back into intellectual discourse, with broad influence on many of the great minds of the Renaissance and beyond.  The story is very interesting, readable, accessible to a non scholar.  So many issues intersecting in these centuries, the return to literacy, the polemics of philosophy and Christianity.  This is a book which has stirred my interest in reading more on a variety of related subjects.  That is the sign of a good book for me.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is the one, the only, the original. Thanks, Adobe, for a solid product that really does the job. Yay!
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|This game is fun, and I would give it more stars if the steering worked better. I will have it turned to the right to make a turn in the game, and it will just start to flutter so you can't make the turn; then you hit something. Don't get me wrong I like the game; just needs some work, or maybe it doesn't function proper on a Kindle Fire HD.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This movie is a good extension of the other Bourne movies. It is a good escape movie if you don't take these things too seriously.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Okay, I have to say that I am a sucker for a boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back love story. This story is so beautiful and James Garner is so good in this movie. Ryan Gosling, yikes, who wouldn't fall in love with him? Rachel McAdams is believable as the spunky rich girl who experiences her first summer romance. What is it about summer?? Gena Rowlands and James Garner are the true gems here. Rowlands keeps her performance just fragile enough to draw you in while Garner exudes a heartfelt love and devotion that most people don't feel in a lifetime. Pure Hollywood, pure fantasy, pure love. Grab the popcorn and a box of kleenex. Enjoy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|What can I say. You will love the book if you like the spy, secret agent type stories. I have been a Vince Flynn fan from his first book. This is another winner. What can I say?
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I had heard good things about the show and finally decided to watch it.  I am glad I did.  If you make it to episode 2, then you are hooked.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I've read all the Grisham books. His last few books had become predictable an some even mundane, in my opinion. Not this one. This book is total fiction. It moves quickly, with many twists and turns. You will like this book if you like the early Elmore Leonard books.
0345529057|5.0|Great price for the book series. The books are fantastic to read. Unfortunately the story telling gets worse the further you go within the books, but they are still well worth the time to read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have downloaded this app on all my devices.  The picture quality is awesome and the pin features work very well on the Kindle Fire.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I was happy that this was at a reasonably price. I have enjoyed watching it and have just ordered the third season.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I got this app for my Kindle Fire..  works very well.  My only issue is that it does not override the screen lock so i have to enter the password before i can snooze or dismiss the alarm.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I had the flu over Christmas and I had seen this on TV. I was so happy that I got it at a great price!
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I despise iTunes and don't use a computer to watch movies so digital copy does nothing for me. I love purchasing movies with an Ultraviolet copy. I download them to my Droid.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This is just a great fun low stress game, but very addicting!  I played something similar to this a few years back but forgot how simplicity can nwind you.
1423165691|5.0|Such an amazing book I mostly bought it cause Glen Keane's Ariel sketches are in it yum yum yum yum
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|\\"Bewitched books? Daemons following you? Vampires taking you to yoga?\\" This line from Deborah Harkness's A Discovery of Witches sounds like the opening to an infomercial when taken out of context, but it also lends itself to summarizing the novel itself.<br /><br />Diana is a witch who just wants to fit in with humans and does not want to use magic to the point that she can count how many times a year she's actually used magic (but she really had no choice when it came to the incident with the washing machine). Diana is also a professor and a scholar in the history of science.  Specifically, she focuses on alchemy. Her anti-magic using ways are turned on their head after she requests an alchemical manuscript referred to as Ashmole 782 from the stacks at Oxford's Bodleian Library, and she is thrust into a world of not only witches, but vampires and daemons as well. Conspiracy abounds in this first book of the All Souls Trilogy and pulls the reader along for the thrilling ride.<br /><br />Over all, the book is decent. There are a few things that annoyed me as a reader. The first third of the book is very repetitious; the reader really gets to know Diana's daily routine because every chapter details it in depth. Once Diana and Matthew (the vampire) leave Oxford, the book finally breaks out of its routine and picks up in both action and interest.<br /><br />The amount of detail describing certain things borders on obnoxious. Harkness obviously is into rowing and wines, and she wants you to know this. Diana's rowing exercise is described in detail in multiple chapters, but doesn't come near to the rambling descriptions of how certain wines taste and smell. I got to the point where I just skimmed over these because it was becoming ridiculous and unnecessary. Yes, we get it, the witches and vampires have super smelling senses.<br /><br />Harkness does do a wonderful job of world building when she's not getting lost in the minute details, and the book has interested me enough to where I will pick up the other books in the series eventually (as of writing this review, the second book, Shadow of Night, has just been recently released), but I won't clamber to get them on release day. I'll wait until I can pick them up from a bargain bin or from a second hand store.gh to where I will pick up the other books in the series eventually (as of writing this review, the second book, Shadow of Night, has just been recently released), but I won't clamber to get them on release day.

B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|I don't usually buy complete albums, But i will buy Rihanna's albums anytime.. Hopefully she can continue making good music ..
B00009AOBI|4.0|Pleased with the movie and the special features under the director's cut.  Received movie quickly and would recommend to anyone who is a fan of the original.
B009L7MD44|4.0|For the hardware, it does work as its advertised.<br />For the software, i wish they have their own<br />standalone app to access the hardware, and<br />not using safari as the primary role; -1 star.<br /><br />And as for amazon.. ftw!!!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Fun game that requires some strategy and even some geometry concepts. Fun for all ages, a quite entertaining, amusing game.
B008OOYALE|5.0|great game.  love so much I'm playing two islands.  on phone and kindle fire. although it does take along time to evolve some dragons and things could be less expensive.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Awesome. This was the best  book yet. I'm so glad that Percy and Annabeth got together this time around. I love Grover too.
B0002858YS|5.0|Only one song I don't like but the others are, well, killers. Love love love it. On Top is SEXY.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app did all it was supposed to do and was handy for checking out the strength of wi-fi signals wherever I went.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my nephrews. I understand that they love it. It arrived in the mail quickly and packaged perfectly.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|A revolutionary theory that was recommended to me by my medical doctor. This should be a classic in out time.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I am not sure how we survived without Google search. That is the go to phrase in our home - Do a google search!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am always looking ahead for the weather forecasts in our areas.  This app is great!  Use it every day
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I think this movie is too often compared to Dark Knight Returns. It's a great third act, and I don't know how the next Batman franchise can live up to Nolan' s.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game.  I have always enjoyed playing.  I am glad to have it with me when on the go. Everybody needs a diversion now and then.
B009X01ELC|4.0|My husband really likes this case.  It is attractive and very sturdy.  It allows you to view the screen in several ways.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|I should have read the description first.  I was hoping for something different, as in national weather.  I am nearly 3,000 miles from LA
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Excellent story teller. He holds the reader with the story line and the characters. Cant wait for the final edition
B00992CF6W|5.0|great app really catches the point of mincemeat and puts it in an<br /> iPhone version. it has less blocks than the computer version
B008X9Z37A|4.0|There is nothing fancy about this case, but it is good alternative to the pricier offerings.  It is pretty much plain vanilla.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game I can't wait for #2. I love Big fish games. I wish you would make more mystery case files games available for KindleFire HD they're my favorite!!! In the mean time I'll still be playing the ghetto pc versions as well.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Don't really like this version of Pac Man.  Hard to maneuver on a tablet.  I would not recommend to anyone. Quickly deleted the download after a few tries.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved every second of reading this book. I just couldn't put it down! Can't wait until the next book in the series comes out.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|Quick read - but found it to be pretty decent. Tamer person's 50 shades of grey. But Travis could definitely beat up Christian.
B00A757EFW|4.0|fun game gets you talking to yourself when pac man is about to be got. play it more that other.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The 8th time I have read this series in 4 years, started reading on a whim the last time I was deployed without ever hearing about the books or movie. I'm back in Afghanistan and reading it again, Kindle style! Thanks Stephanie!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Another fun game to play, really keeps you on your toes trying to shoot down the missiles. Each level  is a little harder.
0765325950|5.0|I have admittedly been a fan of this series for many years.  I also admit that this book was undoubtedly not written exactly the way that Robert Jordan himself would have written it.  But I am completely and thoroughly satisfied with the final product.  It tied up all of the loose ends that it needed to, without trying to go too far.  I am thankful that we were able to read the end of the story at all, and I find it hard to believe that it could have been better under the circumstances.  RIP Robert Jordan, and thank you for your dedication to your fans in leaving the notes that you did so that this could be written.
B008L1DNGI|2.0|Just didn't like the way thee game ran. seem to be to much lag time after moving the arrow. just wanted to try the game, this game is not for me.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I must say... I'm not a fan of Zooey Deschanel's acting (at all). But her singing voice rocks!!! She should of just stayed to what she does best - SINGING! I loved this CD. If you are looking for christmasy music that's not the same usual boring christmas hymns (don't get me wrong, those can be great too... just not when you've heard the same old ones year after year!), this CD just might do the tick to get you into that Christmasy cozy feeling! Merry Christmas (and Happy Birthday, Jesus:) !
B00796E7CA|5.0|Gave a lot of great new details, especially loved all the new detail on the Third Age. All in all a lot of great new information.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Good and easy read. Kept my interest throughout the whole book. Coming of age story in a different format compared to overcoming of age stories.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was entertaining.  Sometimes I found the author´s use of a select few large words to be comical and a bit distracting at times but I would definitely read the other two.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|life lessons! Recommend this to all of your family and friends.  recommend it to people that you have just met!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I normally play this game at night before I go to bed. It starts out really easy on the first few levels and becomes more challenging as you go along. This is a great pass time and for free works great on my kindle fire hd.
B0055S348W|2.0|When I upgraded Printershare, it did not recognize my printers.  , I am trying PrintHand which is working fine on my Nexus 7. PrintHand also has more options regarding printers.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I removed this from my Kindle fire hd 7&#34; without attempting to play. These hidden object games I play alot on my desktop, however the screen on my kindle is just to small for me to see what need to play.
B0000248VB|3.0|I was dissapointed but it has no bearing on the recording. It's just not what I expected it to be.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Wholesome family movie and well done.  Appreciated the clean language.  It is based on the true story of the Secreriat.
0688014291|3.0|This book is a good refrence and building block to use with leadership. It would be a good method to use when you are strapped for time but not a every day rule.
B004XN3FHA|3.0|I purchase the light from Amazon Marketplace and was estatic about it.  It came fast and well packaged.  Everything went smoothly except it wouldn't toggle to the turbo mode.  It would rotate from low, medium, and high and high again,  but not turbo.  I ended up returning the defective unit.  I also purchased a TK41 U2 and had the same problem.  Either both units were defective, or I didn't know if there was a special button to push.  Would've kept either, if the turbo mode worked.  Watch out for  non - new versions, you may get the one I had problems with.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If I could give this book more stars then 5 I would. I couldn't put this book down for the life of me. It catches at your heart strings and pulls you in needing to know more. I would absolutely recommend this book!
B007RI56NY|5.0|Surprisingly good. Two of the tracks, Drive by and 50 Ways to say goodby, are really good. Sorry I missed them in concert in Mammoth last year, but will watch for them to show up close by again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My daughter love this game is fun to play... Keep her playing the game and find new thing on the game
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|I read this in middle school back in the 1980's.  Please take the time to read the authors forward in the event this is your first time reading the book.  Still holds up after all these years.  A classic.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Wonderful graphics. First few ranks are easy enough to get. Getting neighbors is somewhat difficult. I still enjoy playing and my kids do too.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The name of this game made it sound silly but my curiosity got the better of me so I tried it. It's a lot of fun and is teaching me to check the route of my aim carefully and I think I will be making a slingshot this summer.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Really? What kind of people does love so much to read about child abuse that give 5 stars to this book? And worse, why write about it in this way?<br />This is not funny and not entertaining at all. Authors HAVE to be RESPONSIBLE about what they write.<br />So now the hype is explicit child abuse and thumbs-up for pedophiluos (You surely have heard about a greyish character that said that the best think that happened in his life was meeting a pedophiluos?)<br />Really???<br />My. Some people are hopeless!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|really is a search game! loved it. found myself playing all night.  if you are looking for a game to make you think while enjoying. this is it
B002GHHHP6|5.0|good american movie in western style with some twist in it) so it worse to watch it and enjoy it
B004LWZW6K|5.0|I saw the original Piranha when it came out years ago, not the recent 3D one the real original one.  It was campy but fun.  Piranha 3D was campy fun also and this one is outrageously funny.  I would put this on the same level as  Scary Movie 2.  The nice thing about movies like this is that the characters are so cartoonish, you can't wait for them to get killed off.  Hasselhoff's performance itself is worth the price of this movie.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Tom Hanks just right for this part. get in role with all he got! funny, you can watch it with Whole family)) even more then once)
B00ARW2XJW|2.0|Not too accurate for the outside temp. Seemed to work okay when I loaded it. Then I changed locations, but it didn't.
B002ZG999U|5.0|funny to watch! action! predictable but with some twist! good actors! perfect for one time. don`t think that you would watch it more then once
B0092MKFIY|3.0|not a bad album to listen to overall, but it sounds like a compilation of several other artists, ones that I've heard before. I actually listen to it and go, \\"oh, this is the motion city soundtrack song, this is the killers song,\\" etc. but I think it was worth the 5 bucks. I especially like the song demons.
B002VECM6S|5.0|true movie about true story of life of one family!actor are great! Sandra just perfect for this one! good good mivie
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It does its job well and it's easy to use.  The price was was ok.  Wish you had sales on this item.
B00144VBBS|5.0|I have had this CD for quit awhile now and I am extremely happy with it. It is true Toby at his best.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|TripAdvisor.com is a flawed, still good system of rating the hospitality industry and locally found points of interest.  The Ap works fine.  The problem with TA is theoretically, anyone can rate a restaurant or inn having never stayed there.  This 'wide-open' forum leads to fraud and misinformation.  Hardly ever is any place as good or as bad as it gets rated.<br />-ap
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was worth the wait!! Great book and a real page turner.As always Vince Flynn weaves a great story and I'm looking forward to his new series.Thanks for the great \\"read\\" Mr.Flynn
B004U52VPS|5.0|Gave this as a Chrismas gift to my 4 year old little cousin who instantly declared, &#34;This is exactly what I have always wanted!!!!!&#34;  Priceless.  :)
B0026IUXME|5.0|I thought out of all holocaust type movies i'd say this one and schindlers list to be the top 2. The movie was decently long which i liked and was a very well acted out movie and did a great/moving job of showing how things were in that period of history although things were so horrible. It was a great movie overall and i'd suggest it to anyone that wants to see a good WWII holocaust movie.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|This story involves a tragic fire and it's aftermath. How the arsonist is found and that person's motivation is told from a different viewpoint that a normal mystery.. It held my interest more than a lot of books do.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|this movie was ok but not that great, for one what people said about the violence is true, it's like &#34;hostel&#34; type violence in an old setting a bit too gruesome like ok we get the point. And secondly the storyline moved very fast, i pretty much seen almost everything in the previews in the first half hour of the movie, some of the acting was good, but a lot seemed bad, i didn't like the guy forest's acting much, seemed kind of wierd. Not a movie i'd rent or watch again really.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game.  It can be challenging at times but great fun both kids and adults. It works well with your kindle fire.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|another good batman movie to add to the series. Long and entertaining, very cool. the whole batman series is just awesome.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed the characters that were developed in the beginning of the story.I caught on quickly to part of the secret almost in the beginning of the story which made me better understand Linden/Sky and the persona she displayed.  The love story was passionate and unpredictable. I found myself smiling, laughing out loud, feeling a twinge of pain in my chest, and I think I even shed a tear.  The only thing I wished would have been different is that I would have liked the best friend to have played a bigger role in the story. I really liked her and her real name.
B002YCVX5S|4.0|if you like WWII movies and don't mind a little wacky changes to history this movie is pretty cool, a little violent but overall entertaining and very well acted out.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Bought for an AMD A8-5600K to act as the paste and has yet to fail or provide any problems. Have used Arctic Silver since building pcs and would recommend this to anyone who needs cost effective thermal compound.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|the jokers acting. rip heath ledger, bat man series,...what else can i say this movie is still one of the greatest movies yet.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I didn't want to read this book, but I sure am glad I did. Don't all women want a wealthy man sweeping them off their feet?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Who CANNOT live without Facebook on all their electronic devices?!?!?!  Besides having Yahoo for e-mail, I absolutely need Facebook on my Kindle Fire HD!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was the best of all the books. The author wrapped the story up nicely. Never expected it to be a happily ever after...
B00632HWOG|5.0|I absolutely NEED my e-mail on all of my electronic devices!!  Glad that the Kindle Fire allows access to Yahoo!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Obviously the middle book. iI read because I just had to know what was going. It is my least favorite of the trilogy
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoy this game very much but it was to easy. I love g5 games. keep it coming. G5 you rock.
B007HJHO2O|5.0|Combining Progressive Rock with Massive Guitars, DeeExpus' King of Number 33 is one of the best albums of the decade. Highly recommended for anyone who is into either Rock or Prog... you'll find something to love on this album
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I loved this movie! I saw it twice in the theater and just couldn't wait until I could own it for myself.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I would have liked it more if it had more action like the other books. So I say ok but not the best.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|You can not help but identify with the main character.  Read this book. You won't be able to put it down.
0060012234|5.0|One of my favorite series =) My favorite \\"part\\" is the character accuracy. The thoughts and actions are realistic. No door-slamming, eye-rolling, huffing teenagers. Hartinger's characters remind me a lot of many of my friends. The story line is simple, but it's the quirky things put into the writing that makes it entertaining and quirky. I didn't put it down until I finished it: the same day I started it.<br /><br />I highly recommend the whole series =D
1452658145|5.0|Excellent read.  Write a summary after each chapter and and review it often, then reread again tell others what you read and how you will apply iy.
B000SEIK2S|3.0|This is a solid debut novel with an interesting premise and plenty of action, but the writing leaves something to be desired at times, especially the overly witty dialogue.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I found it was a great book. Very interesting. Can't wait for the movie although books are always better. Can't wait for next one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Doodle guy us pie and likes to sing and dance. He has no friends and is considered weird and annoying.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I had seen but never played or understood this game before. Now I'm completely hooked. Definitely challenging and it's hard to stop playing it.
B001AXU1CS|5.0|The price was just right for this movie, i have up to the point no complaints, my gf was pretty happy when she got it.
034580404X|5.0|it was everything i had hoped it would be and i will def be reading this series again in the future!!!
B007N8RULO|4.0|addictive and fun. The more sets you play the more challenging the game becomes. Definately reccommend it to anyone bored with regular solitaire.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I rated this book because I like books like this. There was no part of the book that I didn't like. I would recommend this book to 5th- 7th graders, because our grade and she appropriate so...... yea
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This is the first album I've purchased in a long time, i bought it because It was something so new and interesting. Also the download price is reasonable making it a very comfortable purchase. The recording is not entirely in my taste however with breaths being heard in the recording but the sound overall is very good. If you want to listen to something new and love the mix between electronic and rock then you will love this album i highly recommend giving it a chance. I suggest you give the whole thing a listen before making up your mind.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I had some down time and this book was perfect . I read another Baldacci after this one. A smart mystery.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Quick mini games. Not very difficult. Some scary images. Only part of the game is free, to get complete game you have to pay.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried and i never cry. It was wonderful and brilliant. God bless. Time to start reading more John Green.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I thought the book was very repetitive. Book 2 was the better of the 3. It was just okay. There was more hype than there should have been.
098478280X|5.0|It is useful for searching jobs. But I think the word is little small which make me not comfortable. I prefer the ebook
B00846REIS|5.0|I haven't finished it yet.  It's a page turner.  Some similarities to 50 shades but written better.<br />I recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really liked this book. Thought it was better than Fifty Shades of Grey.  Can't wait to read the next book.
075669812X|5.0|I bought this for my 10-year-old son who enjoys LEGO Ninjago sets, and he loves it because it has nice pictures and detailed descriptions of all of the characters. Highly recommended!
0307266303|5.0|I liked this book because his stories just keep unfolding, they keep evolving, so you never get bored of it. The chapters are very short and the book is genuinely easy to read and follow along.
B009JBZH54|5.0|For most of us, life feels like a movie we've arrived at forty-five minutes late.<br /><br />Something important seems to be going on . . . maybe. I mean, good things do happen, sometimes beautiful things. You meet someone, fall in love. You find that work that is yours alone to fulfill. But tragic things happen too. You fall out of love, or perhaps the other person falls out of love with you. Work begins to feel like a punishment. Everything starts to feel like an endless routine.<br /><br />Life happens. But. It does not happen to you!<br />You happen to it!<br />We r not victims !<br />For everything that happens in life there is a decision I can make that will make the outcome manageable. Poor decisions: sad consequences. Good decisions : Happy Consequences.<br />;~PB
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really like this app. I like that it tells me how long it will take to charge and how long my Kindle Fire HD will run while using various things, such as reading books, playing games, and during the web.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|I'm 55 years young. I had many Zeppelin albums on vinyl and had not played them at all for many years as we have no turntable. I saw the Kennedy Center Honors and was just needing to reconnect with that feeling I had listening to their music so long ago. This collection of songs is perfect - all the best tunes! I love it.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I have listened to a number of cast recordings of Les Miserables (London Cast, Broadway Cast, Symphonic Recording, Japanese Cast, 2010 Dream Cast, and 25th Anniversary) - and this one, in my opinion, trumps all of them. The orchestra, and the actors and actresses most of all. The vocals are sublime. WHenever I try listening to the other recordings, I feel that something is lacking. What it is not complete, it makes up for in vocal quality. If the cast playing will one day reunite to play Les Mis again - I will get seats in a heartbeat.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Coraline -It was for my Great-Grandson who wanted it almost everytime we went to the library! He really likes the movie.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I decided to watch the entire series as many of my friends have been watching it.  I have to admit that after the first one, I wasnt sure but now I am up to episode 8 and look forward to the rest of them.  It is pretty gory so if you are squeamish, you probably should close your eyes at the bad parts but other than that, great show!
B005LAII8K|3.0|Looper is a scifi written and directed by Rian Johnson<br /><br />Joseph Gordon Levitt does some great impersonations of Willis.The budget of this movie was extremely cheap,being 30 million.The special effects were great.Not too much action because of the budget.Jeff Daniels gets to eat again and has a good villian performance.However if JGL couldn't carry a movie on his own.The best parts were when Willis has the screen time.His acting and action scenes were great as usual.
1416905014|5.0|Bought this for my daughters 3rd birthday.  It is a work of art!  This is NOT a book to turn your kid loose with.  My daughter has been taught to treat books with the best of care, so she can be trusted to look at it on her own, but I still won't throw it in our book bin for regular play.  We reserve this book for adult led story time.  The pop-ups are truely amazing!!!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|My main criticism of this book is with all the acronyms. I got so I wouldn't have been surprised to see that BYT was short for Brush Your Teeth.  It's not necessary and caused me some confusion.  It came on strong in the end, though, and had a pretty good ending.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I love the artistic design of this<br />Verso Artist Series Kindle Fire Case Red.<br /> I would only say to improve it there might be a magnet of some kind incorporated into the corners to assist in keeping the case closed, or an artistic tie or button perhaps. Otherwise, I really like the case.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|I have watched this movie quite a few times, and am happy to have it on hand. Inspirational and beautiful.
B007MDB548|5.0|My girls love Disney and Tinkerbell.  Great story.  You can read all about it in other reviews.  My girls all give it a thumbs up.  Me too!
B007H1HQW0|5.0|At first I didn't have much luck as the bottles were not breaking evenly.  Only one bottle cracked up the side and was completely useless.  You must be sure to score the bottle evenly, once, not overlapping where you began.  I dip in cold water, then into hot, then into cold, until the bottle cracks.  The key note is to follow the directions and ensure the handle at the bottom has been tightened completely in order to keep the cutter steady and your line straight.  I cannot emphasis how important it is to adjust this handle every time!  I also have found that liquor bottles are harder to deal with than wine or beer bottles.  Bottles with a thick seam running down the sides are also harder break apart evenly.  The tapper that comes in the set is pretty much useless - I recommend throwing it out.
0307341577|5.0|I read Gone Girl so thought I would try out another book by Gillian Flynn... I did not regret it. I started this book on my first week back to work after christmas break, big mistake! It was very hard to put down.  Loved the suspense around this book and the way you got to know the story from each central characters viewpoint. I would absolutely recommend this book for anyone who likes a dark murder mystery.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great to Play, Not alot of Hard to do Items...Allows for Teammates,,,,Travel the World and Learn about Many Cities around the World!
0307266303|5.0|Bought this book for my son's birthday.  Although he isn't a runner per-say, he loved it just the same.  I did read some excerpts and found them very interesting.
B000WKT6C6|5.0|I Love J J Cale!!  He is not so much known as a Singer,,,However THE BEST!!  He Has Written so Many Songs that Have made Other Musician's Millions......Check out this J J Cale,,,you will be suprised to Hear Him Sing His Many songs...I Highly Suggest to begin with \\"Magnolia\\".......Love Love Love J J Cale...What Talent that is so unknown by Many!!  Worth all your investmenst!!!  A \\"LEGEND\\".....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Unexpected ending ...I tried to figure it out the whole time...loved the ending. Fell in love with the characters..I would recommend
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very good book and I couldn't put it down. The book was even better than the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|soooooo addictive, i can't put it down. lots of free levels, definately worth trying. shorter levels are great for kids, and the harder levels are really challenging for adults.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This is the first book that my daughter bought on her new Kindle Fire and loved it. She finished reading it within a days time.
B009O5CLZY|3.0|I absolutely love this game, but it needs to be updated to the same version that is available on Google Play Store.  I have this same app on my droid phone and it has a North Pole map and also has so many more power ups and costumes that can be purchased.  I gave it a 5 star on Google.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show - completely addicted. Watch the first two seasons in less than a week. Thank goodness I am a Prime member!
B009Y6OIWC|2.0|So far I do like this app, but I really wish it had the ability to subscribe to a URL calendar.  My work uses online scheduling and I am able to subscribe to it through google calendar but it does not carry over to this app.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Love this app have it on my iphone. The thing I like most about this app is the ability to spell the words you are looking for.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|The gift was just what was wanted.  My grandaughter said it was the best Christmas ever. Therefore I was completely satisfied.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I absolutely love this television series! It brings back the old memories I had as a child of the fairy tales my mother used to read to me. This is by far the best television series yet!
B008LAO7C8|5.0|They say this album took 20 years to make and is a culmination of everything Swans has done. It's fantastic and the vinyl version is incredible.<br /><br />The 3 LP vinyl is on heavy black vinyl in a beautiful jacket, though it's difficult to get the middle LP out of the sleeve. The only drawback to this is I don't have a mylar sleeve large enough to fit the 3 LP package.
0385535147|1.0|There is so much immorality in this book, I will not be in a hurry to buy another John Grisham
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is great! I love it. I wanted something with great graphics that would keep me entertained for hours. This game has done just that. I love animals so this game is great for me! You have objectives that need to be fulfilled but you can use the peanuts in the game if you don't want to complete that goal. You don't need friends to help you. That's great! All in all this game is awesome!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|We followed Phillip through his quest for American Idol and were trilled he won.  This CD is wonderful and we look forward to his next one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was good in the beginning. Once you get halfway through it is okay. The ending in my opinion kind of sucks. Really no matter what happens no one will ever be gone in this book. Except for maybe his soul.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|What a wonderful view of the work environment and the advertisement industry in the 1960's.  We love the series and can't get enough!!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Sometimes ok action punctuates long stretches of tedious dialogue. The climatic chase, motorbikes in Manila, is underwhelming - the &uuml;ber-assassin opponent is not too impressive. Thankfully the action is not ruined by the stupid-shaky-cam of the previous Bournes. A harrowing workplace shooting - the helpless, unarmed victims all menaced by a single gunman - makes a good case for ubiquitous arms in the office.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game but hate it when I get stuck on a level and can' t move forward in the game.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|If you Liked Led Zeppelin's movie The Song Remains The Same then you will love Celebration Day.  The performance of the band is just as good, if not better, as on The Song Remains The Same when they were at the height of their popularity back in the 70s. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones still the same sound and energy that captivated their fans almost 40 years ago.  John &#34;Bonzo&#34; Bonham's son Jason on the drums sounds just  like his father did before his death in 1980.<br /><br />The quality of the video and the audio on the Blu-ray disc exceeded my expectations. Watching the Blu-Ray Disc on my home theater system was next best thing to being there at the concert.  The 2CD set, which has the same songs in the same order as the blu-ray disc,  makes it convenient to listen to it on your home stereo  or portable CD player when can't sit down and watch it.
B00A17AD36|5.0|This entire trilogy is amazing and for three cds you just don't luck out like that. The amazing thing about this artist and the trilogy is that he sings for every song and only has one collaboration out of three cds! That is talent I haven't seen in many years!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is fun and a great time killer when you have nothing to do.  I take my Kindle with me when I am going to an appointment (Dr. Dentist etc) when I know there will be a wait.  This makes the time pass and my blood pressure stays down.
B0013O123Q|4.0|Although the movie was very disturbing it's different and worth watching. There were times I couldn't watch it bc was so violent. The movie does, however, come full circle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had no idea that this series was so good, just thought I would check it out. Was sooooooooo pleasantly surprised!!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Recieved a Kindle HD7 from my kids for Christmas and love it. They let me choose my own accesories and I got this case in Red so I could lay my kindle down and find it!  I recieved it from Amazon in just a few short days and am very pleased!
B00AJIYPQ8|5.0|This series is quite amazing.  The actors have kept it fresh and yet maturing throughout all 8 seasons.  The plots are good and the stories can sometimes be haunting--no pun intended.  If you like Vampire Diaries, you will love this!
B000005JFX|5.0|I have been searching for this for a long time! The whole reason I bout this is due to U2 being on here doing a Frank Sinatra song and its amazing! Thank you
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one book I will be talking about for a long long time. Colleen Hoover is my new favorite author. Hopeless is a very hard book to put down. You will laugh, cry, feel and fall in love. Holder and Sky will touch your heart from the very beginning. I have never written a review before but there is so much I want to stay.  You just need to read it. Trust me and all the others who have read this book.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It is better than most of his recent books but certainly not his best.<br />Grisham tells good stories.<br /><br />THE RACKETEER
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I can't wait for each new Scarpetta novel to be released, and I am rarely disappointed!<br />Although some readers grow tired of the &#34;typical&#34; storyline.....(it always seems that someone is out to get Kay.)<br />But, true fans appreciate the great writing of Patricia Cornwell.<br />Easy to understand, well explained medical terms, interesting storytelling, and<br />OUTSTANDING and captivating characters ALWAYS make Scarpetta novels<br />a great read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A slow start but the author made up for that later.<br />Wonderful tricks played on the reader  and the ending was superbly creepy.<br />Bad guy and girl finished last....justice was served!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game! Unlike many other games, it lacks many of the violent themes, so, I don't mind him playing. He talks about planning and strategy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I thought the calculator was very helpful. I like the design. Its very efficient. It's very easy to use. You will absolutely love it.
8866130885|5.0|It's awesome! I love the Moleskine products and have used them for years! The Star Wars edition just makes it COOL!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This book had substance and direction to go with the mystery. The last two or three Pendergast novels were setting the stage for this novel. It is fantastic.
145210655X|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend seeing as he was about to become a daddy himself and he's a huge star wars nut the book went over well and he thought it was funny
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Quick read, very engaging. Wonderful story which truly unfolds in a unique way. Loved the character development and discovery with Charlie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Started a bit slow, but soon I was unable to put it down.<br />A good suggestion for a book club.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|1. Great acting<br /><br />2. Extremely suspenseful.<br /><br />3. Great plot<br /><br />4. Very involved plot<br />5. A lot of action.<br /><br />6. Very well written.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Deleted it from my Kindle Fire. Pac Man moves too slow and doesn't follow the commands very well. I always ended up dying because I couldn't get the the little guy to move where I wanted him to.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I loved this book. The more I read the more I became inspired by her story. My heart went out to her for the hardships she endured. I cried when she was reunited with her mom.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I wish it was longer for how much I paid. but good cut scenes and great images. hope more might come out and some good updates.
B0080K3J7S|3.0|I have to be honest, I couldn't finish this novel. No one is more surprised than me. I love everything else Neal Stephenson has written. I've been trying to put my finger on why I didn't like it. The characters are well developed, he's certainly done his research, and although I wouldn't say the plot moves on at a cracking pace, that's what we've come to expect from this author.<br />In the end I think it's because once again Americans save the world. With all due respect to our friends in the U.S. occasionally something of significance does occur without your input.<br />Anyway Americans will probably love it but everyone else may find it a bit hard to swallow.
1932100660|5.0|I have read Geeta, seen Mahabharat (The Biggest Epic of the World) and many other complex and length epics.<br />I found really a lot of similarity I mean Dr. Campbell has given the information in such a depth and given so many references that really there is NO question left in my mind.<br /><br />I would read it again and again & will always get the benefit from it.<br />He has written it so bravely that Government and Animal Industry must be feeling bad.<br /><br />Reading this book I feel I have more knowledge of the disease then most of the doctors in this world. Everyone must read it<br /><br />I really wonder how it is possible that Government spent huge Tax Dollars in doing all this research but later they are not taking a single step to let the Citizens know about this? Instead they are doing heavy advertise for Diary, Subsiding Animal Products, Subsiding Tobacco and considering Fruits and Vegetables which are healthy as speciality Crops by limiting water to the farmers?<br /><br />Dr. Campbell Humanity will never forget you. You have given the most Important Gift to us. Thank you so much will all my heart.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the Bible app.  I'm able to read the Bible; look up verses, set up daily reading plans.  This app makes it easy to do devotions on a daily basis.  Nice way to stay connected to the word of God!!!
0785163174|1.0|The addition of the digital copy does not make this book worth $75. Also half of the book is the extra comics that don't truly support the storyline. That half reads like the DC versus Marvel comics (or Contest of Champions if you know the reference).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. Interesting from start to finish. For teens and up. I would recommend this book to anyone I know.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! I am looking forward to book number two! I would highly recommend this book to all of my friends.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this book was awesome and funny. I think their were a lot of funny moments in this book and it was really entertaining. I couldn't take my eyes off the story. I hope the author makes plenty more diary of a wimpy novels.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a heartbreaking tale.  I remember seeing her posters when I was growing up (we are close to the same age).  It was amazing when she was found alive.  Her book provides a lot of detail on her life in captivity, and definitely gives you some perspective.  I can't believe that she walked away from this experience with such a positive outlook.  Definitely worth the read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game really awesome. It requires skill and strategy. You just have to connect the colored dots to finish each level. It is simple, yet really complicated.
B0076DELIG|5.0|If you like Connelly and his Bosch novels, you'll like this one.  I really didn't see the ending coming, and love the way that he puts the stories together.  The only problem that I have with Connelly is that he doesn't write enough.  I usually finish a book in 2-3 days, and then have to wait several months for the next one :(
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is really great, and once I start, it's hard to put down. You are running on a temple wall, and there are monsters chasing you. You jump over obstacles, and slide over others. The character can collect coins, so you can unlock powerups and other characters. This game is amazing, it even won \\"Favorite App\\" in the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Loved the movie in the theaters.  Also like the DVD disk that looks like a burned CD/DVD.  Nice play on the &#34;hacker&#34; angle of the film.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Love story that entertains , a little  predictable because most domestic violence case are. However, it is always refreshing for a girl to have a knight in shining armor even in her every day life.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|although i truly enjoyed the story line and found it fresh and new, there were too often not much going on. i found myself skipping pages. all the 5 stars??? i cannot agree but a great read non the less.
B00785P2QC|5.0|If you really like a slow pace very interesting game then this is the game for you! I have really enjoyed this game I would recommend it to anyone. It
B0087WRGVY|5.0|To echo everyone else that has left a review :) YES this is great! Every bit as good as their debut. If you like TREAT, ECLIPSE, H.E.A.T, or W.E.T than this is a no brainer... you'll be happy. Enough said!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|While I have not had to use this very much, it will certainly be good to have when traveling or simply to see what the weather is like in other parts of the country where some of our relatives live.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|A very easy read but quite informative. I have always admired Dominique Moceanu, but her story shows how her life was anything but easy. I had a hard time putting the book down.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very user friendly. Works as described, and great graphics. Word word word word word word word word word word word
0802130208|5.0|What's the point of writing a review about this book, when there are something like 1200+ other reviews.  It's clearly a great book that just keeps on selling-and-selling and is probably heading towards that rarified status of contemporary classic.  If you haven't read it, do it now, or at least check it out on the Kindle edition!
B0019M06JS|5.0|If you love Brazilian music as I do, you will not go wrong with Elaine Elias's Bossa Nova Stories. Just great music.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book has depth on SO many levels.  Don't be fooled - this is NOT a children's book.  Ender and his siblings are easy to relate to in that their genius makes them like small/young adults.  It is cool because it's an &#34;in-space&#34; book with lots of physics, but also has politics, and best of all, a deep psychological look into Ender.  For me, it's up there with Harry AND Katniss!
B0000046KM|5.0|I bought this album looking for a song named &#34;ESTATE&#34; which is SUMER in Italian.<br />Not only does Shirley Horn do this tune with sensuality...the entire album turns out is wonderful.<br />Close your eyes and enjoy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! The characters pulled me in, I felt like I was there with them laughing and crying.  I can't wait to read the rest of the series!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander moves the near-death-experience discussion from the parlor to the laboratory.  His dramatic, first-hand experience, coupled with impeccable medical credentials will make a believer out of many skeptics.  This is a &#34;must read&#34;.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Worked for my needs. Well constructed and plenty of room. I needed to carry my camera, lenses etc add well as have room for my purse and travel documents and this pack did the trick.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Simply put, FANTASTIC! Uses the elegance of simple vocabulary to make big, thought-provoking points. It was easy to relate to, to feel like you could very easily be part of their world. Could NOT put it down!
B004QX07G4|4.0|Was a very good book except many of the jokes stories etc I have seen on her daytime show.  I love the lady though-I watch her every day because of pretty much being homebound due to the fact I am waiting for a liver transplant.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook on the Kindle Fire HD provides a current friend feed, but it doesn't support any of the apps that I use on my PC version.  It's really useless to me without these apps.
1451695195|5.0|I have read several books on peoples experiences with the afterlife and I found this one more convincing than the others and different than then the others I have read.  Worth your time.  It's an easy read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's awesome! But a real time suck. I can spend hours just searching for ideas. But I love it and with a little discipline it will be a go to app for me.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I've been reading Stephen King for decades and this did not disappoint.  I hated to see it end and not go on forever.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was so surprised that I actually liked this book. It was hard to put down. A very good book that is not all war and gore. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|Awful! I paid for it and it crashed on me! The game stopped right in the middle, and now it's completely stopped.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  It's exciting and believable.  You really care about the actors and it has decent acting.  I was surprised how much I enjoyed it!
B008CYDD7I|4.0|It has been on my want list for years and hard to find locally. I am very  happy with my purchase.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I really loved all 3 of these books.  Although once I got to the 3rd book I skipped over some sex scenes because I was really wanting to know how the story ended.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Great singing and dancing, predictable teen storyline, entertaining and light.  Some crude language but not offensive.  Great for a movie night at home.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved all of the books in this series.  The first one really grabs you and locks you in.  I couldn't wait to get the 2nd, and 3rd.
B0034C9CFK|5.0|The Freight Train cd by Alan Jackson is wonderful. I love all of Alan Jacksons music, so we listen to this a lot
B00846REIS|4.0|It's alot like 50 Shades.  If you liked 50 your will love this book.  The ending leaves a little to be desired, though
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Nice enjoyable read, book moved along well and had a good plot to make it a worthwhile read....and it did help that Holder was just a dream...mmm mmm mmm
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really liked this book.  It does have a little sex scenes in the first book but it really starts to pick up in the 2nd.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly has done it again with another Harry Bosch Novel. I'm half way through and still have no idea as to the outcome....Connelly is one of the few to be able to do this..... Also Harry seems to be at odds with yet another supervisor, which I always enjoy.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Great book.  You will cry during some parts.  It was very informational to me as well as heart felt.  LOVE
B008S4YZCO|5.0|a typical plot, where you own a farm and buy animals and care for them, but this one seems like it had more refinement or something. anyway, its free, give it a try! if you like the genre of owning a shop/farm where you care for different animals and such, you wont be sorry. you can also fight with your animal. I guess compete is the better word, but anyway, its a very refreshing game in a genre so many other people get into and such. but this one is different enough to pull ahead of its neighbors. the graphics are cute and there are little minor details which I think make all the difference. anyway, go ahead and try it, there's no risk. :)
B006RUJST6|4.0|A definate read!  But you will cry a couple of times throughout the book.  Is a book I will always remember.
0440237688|5.0|The book arrived right on time (2 day shipping) and was in perfect mint condition when I opened it. This was one of my all-time favorite books as a kid and I looked forward to re-reading it now that I have the other two books in the trilogy! :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|The entire series is fantastic.  It will keep you wanting more.  The author is brilliant.  Hope she comes out with another series soon!
B00632HWOG|3.0|I have two Yahoo accounts so Im logged into both of them on the app. it really sucks when it wont allow me to switch accounts so I can view my emails. it takes days for ot to allow me to switch accounts. the faster way for me to view the other account is to sign out of one to view the other and vice-versa. and sometimes it wont delete emails that were suppose to delete. other than those two problems its an ehh ok app I guess.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All of the books in this series is great!  The last one is my least favorite but it brings everything to a great ending.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|The Kindle snaps so tightly into this cover, it feels secure.  I like how it rotates for horizontal or vertical viewing. And the orange color is easy to spot anywhere.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book.  I could really relate to it and loved the mystery behind the characters.  Definate need to read
0375851569|5.0|I purchase this book set for my friend's kids.  The set makes a great gift set.  Everyone loves Dr. Seuss and every child should have his books.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I Love this book! All of Jeff Kinney's work is great! PLEASE CONTINUE TO WRITE! I've read all of his books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Brilliant book - couldn't put it down - the storyline held me captivated - I read this book in record time
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great job on the streaming please keep the new shows coming to Amazon Prime. I dont have TV and love to watch the shows I dont see on tv thru streaming.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent book - the story line was really good and very well written and couldn't the book down. I was sad to finish.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Without this app, I would be hitting the snooze button and being late everyday.  Very simple interface and good amount of personalization
B005IQZB14|4.0|So this is the story of a hike. How boring should that be? But it is so much more. It is thoughtful and introspective and revealing about the nature of humanity. Cheryl does a great job showing her inner change while at the same time keeping the reader entertained as she travels the longest hike any human should even THINK of attempting. She's a great story-teller. Well worth your time!
B00ARAO720|3.0|Good action, if not entirely believable.  If you like to bike, which I don't, you might like it better---or maybe just think it is silly.
6305603847|5.0|Takes a great album to the next level visually, emotionally, aurally, educationally, and passionately... R rated tho and be ready to explain WW 2 and the threat they were to Europe while they were killing so many innocent people. Know your band...
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This wasn't nearly as funny as it was cracked up to me.  The racist jokes sounded a little less tongue and cheek even when coming from the mouth of an animatronic teddy bear vs. Peter Griffin.  Not worth it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|As an ardent follower of the Jack Reacher novels, this ranks right up there.  It makes it even more difficult to envision the runt Tom Cruize as Reacher.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Among various 'complete Holmes' editions, that is.. Very nice formatting, well structured, text is easy and pleasant to read.. Go buy it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham often gets bogged down in lawyer-stuff but this one had just the right mis and a good twist at the end which was delicious.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Loved it.  Nice selection of songs.  Some are old standards untouched, some are standards updated to todays sound, and some are more current.  Will be played for many Christmases to come.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is as accurate as weather predictions get. I wish finding lists of places was simpler - but I still love the app and use it daily.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|In my opinion one of the better parts of the collection. This movie was good and also came with an Ultraviolet code. Very pleased with shipment.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Iam a Haven fan.  And had not got to see all the eposides.  so this was great that I got to spend my christmas break watching season one and two with out missing one.
B003UYV08E|5.0|This actually was for my son as a Christmas gift.  He has the original Iron Man and wanted #2 for his collection.  Great movie and great service.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|Belkin Portfolio Sleeve Carrying Case for Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;, Ruby... is good for the kindle fire. The kindle looks good in it.
0345803493|5.0|I loved the second installment of this series. You get more insight into the characters backgrounds and why they act the way they do. Couldn't wait for the third installment.
B0091REZMW|5.0|The Mystery Manor game is a fun game to play on the kindle fire. If you like mystery games.....you'll like this games.
B008LC8TJI|4.0|I love Maroon Five and love their music. This is a good CD not as good as the last one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds Free is a great and fun game to play for the kindle fire. It's a really fun game to play.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|As always Whitney's songs never fail to inspire and life the heart. I miss her performing before she was sick
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Having the Facebook app on the kindle fire is a good thing. You don't have to be on the computer all the time anymore.
0143038419|3.0|The book was very detailed though sometimes depressing. The search for enlightenment was interesting but not as great as I thought it would be. I enjoyed the movie more.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The Twitter app is good if you like to spend time on twitter. You don't have be on the computer all the time if you have this app.
0345803485|4.0|I was surprised and a bit scared of this character in the book. Once I got further I was not sure I liked it. By the end I couldn't wait for more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awsome thare is noathing bad about this game :]. The only thing bad is thear is no pig man or zombie pig man
0316067938|5.0|This is the first book I have read of this series. The others I saw at the theater. It is a long read however a great end for any Twihards out there.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am a teacher and I read this over the Christmas break so I could keep up with my kids at school. It kept my interest and I can't wait to read the next one in the trilogy.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Kelly Clarkson never fails to impress and inspire. I love her voice and except for &#34;December&#34;, I own all her CD's. To have a greatest hits CD at 30 is impressive. Always a favorite in my book
B008BZIUHG|5.0|You can label Rival Sons as derivative of Led Zeppelin and Bad Company but those bands were derivative of Delta blues. You can't, however, deny how great this album is. Head Down would have been a double LP back in the day but there is not a single weak cut. Singer Jay Buchanan's range is wide: prototypical blues rocker to pleasant falsetto. The way the drums sound and how they're played (by Michael Miley) reminds me of John Bonham.<br /><br />Just get it.<br /><br />[DW]
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Excellent read! I now need to totally revamp my defense plans. I had no idea they could move under water. Sigh!
0547884591|5.0|Another topic, another highly informative book by Tim Ferris. The layout and photographs were beautiful, as well. 5 stars and two thumbs up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Rarely do I ever read fiction.  Suzanne Collins has changed that for me.  In fact, I have not only read Hunger Games but also \\"Catching Fire,\\" the second in the series and am about to start the finale.  This gripping tale of a young woman who is forced to protect her sister by taking her place in deadly games pulls you in with her heroism and keeps you with suspense.  Each chapter building and only lacking background music that I am sure the movies will install to everyone's delight. Reading this book has energized my sense of imagination, while bringing back the joy of reading for pleasure.  A welcome treat after so many years of reading technical journals and business books.  The Hunger Games is a welcomed addition to my kindle.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|This one is worth reading. A summery of what 11 companies did to succeed where others failed. I am busy but took a weekend to read this and glad I did.
1451695195|5.0|This book was very interesting, it has made me earn to go home to be with my Heavenly Abba..I highly recommend it to anyone...it was a ordered as a used book, but the quality of it is excellant.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|No skill or brains required--just a game to play when you really don't have anything to do and don't really want to think.
0439023491|5.0|I loved the book it came in great condition. This is a very good trilogy. Easy to read and very interesting.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|I tried it and it worked the first photo I took.  The next photos I  took they all came out upside down?
B000FBFMIO|5.0|The story takes up more than a decade after the Farseer trilogy, and is a more than adequate continuation of the anti-hero FitzChivalry Farseer's story.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a fun app with lots of different pictures, ideas, etc. to keep your imagination going.  I've used it on my computer for some time, and now I have it on my Kindle fire as well.
B009CVELHG|5.0|MGM's 1932 all-star extravaganza, GRAND HOTEL, was the first of its kind to include several major box-office names in one production. The film utilized a wide range of filming techniques - overhead crane shots, moving camera, cross cutting, artistic lighting and  long takes - to infuse emotion and drama into its premise which takes place entirely at a posh Berlin hotel while overlapping the individual crises of its patrons. It was a novel idea and proved extremely successful, spawning many similarly structured films such as DINNER AT EIGHT (MGM,1933), WEEKEND AT THE WALDORF (MGM,1945), THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (Warner Brothers,1954), and THE V.I.P.S (MGM, 1963), to name a few.<br /><br />Based on a novel and play by Vicki Baum, GRAND HOTEL was directed by Edmund Goulding and stars Greta Garbo, John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery all in roles of equal importance, and each shines in what counts among their best performances. The luminous Garbo is perfect as a tired of life ballerina, her stylized acting captures just the right note of eccentricity. This is the film in which she utters her signature line, \\"I want (not \\"vant\\") to be alone\\". Crawford is radiant, chic and sensitive as a stenographer assigned to work for boorish business magnate Beery, who, despite his villainous character, manages to generate our sympathy. Beery is the only one to affect a German accent which serves to underscore his menace and alienates him from the other characters. John Barrymore displays his celebrated profile and gives a touching and ultimately tragic  portrayal as a thief forced into his trade out of dire need, and Lionel Barrymore is a likeable old fellow who believes he's dying and decides to live it up during his stay at the Grand Hotel.<br /><br />The hotel itself figures as one of the main characters, and its elaborate art-deco design is showcased to great advantage, consisting of a circular construction and checkered floor tiles, topped off by the main lobby desk and telephone switchboard. Everything was given top-notch treatment, resulting in a film that epitomizes the Hollywood studio system at its very finest. Quality and dignity represented the order of the day in that classical period of filmmaking, and GRAND HOTEL met every expectation both critically and commercially, going on to win Best Picture of 1932. To this day it's still regarded as one of the greatest films of its decade, and has been selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\\".<br /><br />The newest Blu-ray release of GRAND HOTEL from Warners is quite grand to be sure, with a clarity and density that outdoes the previous DVD. The grain configuration is  tantamount to 35mm film, and details in clothing and background elements are readily apparent. This pristine presentation of an 81 year old film makes one appreciate even more the exceptional skill of the cinematographers of that time. Of course, they also had movie stars with the kinds of fabulous faces that the camera could adore. The audio on this release is clear and crisp, with voices registering at a pleasing pitch without any distortion. All in all, it makes viewing this vintage classic a very enjoyable experience.<br /><br />The extras are all taken from the DVD: \\"Checking Out\\" - a making-of documentary, the Grauman's Chinese Theater premiere newsreel, \\"Just a Word of Warning\\" Theater Announcement, the Vitaphone spoof \\"Nothing Ever Happens\\", and trailers for GRAND HOTEL and WEEKEND AT THE WALDORF - a 1945 semi remake. The only new feature is a well researched commentary by Jeffrey Vance and Mark Vieira which adds insight and is particularly helplful to viewers who are challenged by older movies.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Who doesn't like facebook?  I do like keeping up with what's going on in my friends' lives and their photos, but I don't like all the silly things people put on there to just fill up their time and my page, i.e., &#34;I'm bored. Going to the frig.&#34;, etc. or &#34;sharing&#34; stupid pics and vulgar sayings.
B000BNI90O|3.0|The three CDs are in perfect quality but the DVD is scratched and the box is torn at some places
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's was a 3-4 star book. Kind of slow start and I was not a fan of the ending. Zzz
B007IXWKUK|1.0|enough said. Moving very very very slowly, bored with the characters and i do not need to read book three.
B004IK8Q86|5.0|This is a wondefullly told story of a number of evocative characters, fauithfullyp portayed throughoput the book. Thrilling genre of how the elite and their friends lived in Europe throughout the 20's and 30's in Europe, especially in Paris and the French Riviera. What could be better. Although not a page turner, I looked forward to picking it up again to find out When Larry would pop up again. this ranks up there with the stories of Edith Warten and Scott Fitzgerald.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story is really full of emotion.  While the sex is great the underlying love story is very good.  Almost makes me believe that love can change a man.  Almost, but not quite.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|an enjoyable read on the beach. a little shorter than normal I believe or else I was in a hurry
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Ok go beyond the bro-cest! Just look at the adult live between two men , and my heart swells. Rented first, now I'm going to buy it
B008469DGY|4.0|ok could be better<br />but still pretty good<br />I wish it was a little less expensive<br />overall not that bad
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love it .the gruesome action and the soft moments had me hooked. I would totally recommend this a quick read
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is the game I've been trying to find for some time... I just really wish it did not have the energy restrictions.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I appreciate an author who can tell a story without using bad language. It was a delightful story. Thank you.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love this book. Thank you so much for a wonderful hard working,it really lovely story which open my heart.
B005GHN2GG|4.0|I bought this book becasue of the theme of love in it and I was not dissapointed. The love scenes are very  passionate. The characters were a little bit simple. The narrative good. All in all a very good book in its genre.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game it is very addicttung and. I play it all the timei would recomemd it to anyone.
048623231X|5.0|Dante would be proud to see his masterpiece so eloquently dipected by Dore. It is the words coming to life in pen and ink.
B000W4RFHK|4.0|Great read. If you have something mote profound to read I would suggest that. All in all a great story though.
B004N622EY|3.0|A new and unique world and magic system. Allomancy is interesting. Feruchemy is also an interesting concept where specific metals are linked to specific abilities. Kelsier is an interesting character, but I couldn't relate to Vin.<br /><br />I didnt like the world very much; at least, not enough to return to it in the second Mistborn book any time soon. Also didn't like Americanisms in an epic fantasy. Modern American language does not gel with epic fantasy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This isn't a philosophical book but a book you need to filter.<br />You are .....<br />Wonderful read for anyone at anytime.
B002DOSBMK|3.0|Well written book, but the world is too dark and disgusting. I dont want to return to Menzoberranzan and drows if I can help it.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Absolutely loved the Fifty Shades series, was so addictive I couldn't put it down.  Would recommend these books to anyone who loves a good read and can't resist a steamy romance.
B000I9TY4G|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the series Firefly. It wasn't until the last couple episodes that I really became indignant that there were no more. Too many ends were fraying. Of course I had to watch the movie! It did a good job of bringing things together and tying up those ends. I may end up buying the graphic novels that explain a bit more of what happened in between. Anyway, it was a good story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was a truly enlightening book it told me a lot about my self and others .being a freshmen in high school my self it really helped me to understand I wasn't the only one with insecurities and fears.
0307408833|1.0|Was very excited about this book.  I have tried about 10 of the recipes and most of them either just did not work or tasted straight up bad (way too salty, bitter, etc.).  I've done plenty of baking from cookbooks, including gluten-free, and am usually very successful.  I can't believe how poorly these recipes are written!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn can not be beat. Wish our government had a MR working our problems. We would be a lot better off than with the idiots we currently have in Washington DC. This is a  MUST READ .

B000W7JWUA|3.0|My family really enjoys playing Catan so I ordered this version along with the Seafarers expansion. They work together well enough, but the cardboard that they are made from is REALLY thin. As some other reviewers have noted, the actual pieces that make up the board bend really easy. I don't mean bend from contact, I mean bow slightly from being too flimsy so that they don't always lay down flat.<br />The game is still playable, but it is nicer when the board stays flat and doesn't have the edges of the hexagons lifting up.<br /><br />As far as the actual game goes... it is a lot of fun as always.<br /><br />I would recommend that the manufacturer spend a little more to make sturdy pieces. It can't be that much, it's only cardboard.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This, like all of MobilityWare's apps, is well crafted.  It is visually appealing and works flawlessly. It is classic solitaire, with various options, much like the version everyone is familiar with on Microsoft Windows.  Recommended.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|The color is really a deep plum so its richer looking than pictured.  i agree with issues mentioned earlier about camera functions and orientation but I didn't intend to use the camera. The stiffness of the fold is a good thing..it really holds the kindle without falling back.<br />I'm not sure It's a great bargain. I had purchased  a leather case that was such nicer which had accessories for 1/2 the price but returned it since it didnt fit the kindle hd.  This one is quite nice and does 90% of what it should at a more than acceptable level.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is the best file manager/explorer I've used on android devices.  I tried a lot of different file managers, but this one just does everything a little slicker and better.  It is very easy and intuitive to use and can be used to sideload apps and make backups as well as manage and manipulate files and folders.  A really good effort by the developer(s).
0061733199|5.0|All I know for sure, is that if I ever got caught in a natural disaster or stranded away from civilization I had better hoped I packed this book. Any circumstance you can think of is covered in here, and almost every solution to a dire situation is written in these pages.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and purchase this book. Extremely useful!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a battery monitor, not a battery manager.  It will not make your battery last longer by managing your device's app usage.  What it WILL do is give you very accurate estimates of how long your battery will last while performing certain activities, like watching videos, playing games, surfing the web, etc. You will need to calibrate it to your device per the instructions, but it works really well and, properly calibrated, is very accurate.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|7year old says this book is a ten, not a five. She loved this one more than any of the others.  She read it twice in less than 5 days!
B009G41CG2|2.0|This version of Mahjong is incomplete, not fully ionplementing the rules of the game.  There is no way to reshuffle, etc.  It makes for a much less than satisfying experience. The developer should look at the version from Magma Mobile in the Google Play store to see how a good implementation should work.  Unfortunately, that version is not available through the Amazon app store, sticking us with crap like this.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|My seven year old daughter says every kid should read this book. She would laugh out loud while she was reading.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a very interesting game based on Mahjong, where you work through increasingly difficult levels.  While not conventional Mahjong, it implements all of the classic rules well and is a great diversion.  The most difficult levels are very challenging.  A good job by the developers and I recommend it.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|after a times of my grandson using the jump-o-lene, the air deflated and it is impossible to find the leak, so it is useless. a big waste of money

6305754969|5.0|I'm not a professional reviewer and could not dazzle you with my prose, even if I wanted to.  Plain and simple, it is a good John Wayne movie.  I'm old enough to enjoy seeing some of the supporting cast in this movie and to see how they all come together to make a good movie is quite enjoyable.  Yes it is very similar to &#34;Rio Bravo&#34;, so what, I enjoy that movie also.  Especially seeing Dean Martin and Rick Nelson doing a duet.  And lets not forget a young Angie Dickinson.  Back to &#34;El Dorado&#34;, and to repeat myself, It's just a good John Wayne movie.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|It only took a couple of espisodes to find myself actually eager to watch a television series. I have never watch a show religiously but, if you start with season 1 and by episode 3, your wil find yourself addicted and that's coming from someone who hates to stay still long enough to even watch tv.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|I find it most entertaining to read the reviews of the professional reviewers and those who want to be professional reviewers, but I'm just a regular working stiff who Just likes the movie.  Not only John Wayne, but a cast with a young Angie Dickinson, Rick Nelson, Dean Martin ( who sing a song together ), Walter Brennan, Ward Bond, and Claude Akins.........  Wow, need one say more.  Buy it, enjoy it.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|Great little app that keeps everyone from my 6 year old up to my husband entertained. Definitely worth the download.
1572816112|5.0|Wasn't going to get this deck but the picture for the Hermit stuck in my mind - huddled in the corner of the room looking like he was having a nervous breakdown.  An interesting take on it to say the least.<br /><br />The whole deck is a wonderful journey into a weird and wonderful world and the pictures are incredibly detailed.  I like the attention to detail.  I have used this deck quite a lot now and like how they handle.<br /><br />The accompanying book is only a small, generalised description of the cards.  Would have liked the artist's commentary on the cards produced.
1423136802|5.0|For the price and the shipping time this item is at the top of my list.  My daughter loved these as her Christmas gift.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game in the world. At first I didn't like it that much. It's awesome now. I don't know what came over me. Minecraft is so cool!!!:)<br />Like this if you agree with me!
0060794410|4.0|bought this because a co worker recommended it...overall the book was great and very informative...wish the author didn't narrative, at times he came across cocky.
B005LAII62|2.0|Most PG rated movies are appropriate for smaller kids, but this one was not, it was scary for my kids, and had a lot of inappropriate lingo/behavior. I didn't think the plot was really that great either, just kind of so-so. I enjoyed Coraline, but even that movie is a little scary too for the younger crowd. I would recommend this for kids older than 8 I think.
159413586X|5.0|fast shipping, and arrived in perfect condition.  I would actually have preferred to not have large print, but did not find any.  Otherwise, I'm happy with my purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Got tbrouh this book in about 2 days.  Had such great characters and so many things I just didn't see coming.  Wish there was more,  I could read about Holder anytime.  At first I was concerned about the age of the main charecters, but it wasn't too \\"high schooly\\" at all.  Overall a fantastic book!

B004XNGKBS|2.0|I really liked the this application for the purpose of taking and saving bible study notes. But the pen feature was less useful than the keyboard function, so I switched to that. My kindle fire has a plenty big enough keyboard so I thought I'd like it.<br /><br />My major problem with this app is the lag time! It is always falling behind when I'm typing and I have to wait for the text to catch up with what I'm typing... and when I get too far ahead it always crashes... an incredibly frustrating experience when you are trying to take notes.<br /><br />One thing I wish they could add is a &quot;write-to-text&quot; feature. One that will take my hand writing and change it to a neater computer font. My dad's palm pilot in the 90s could do it, so I wonder why I haven't found an app that can now.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|good, easy to use and readable.  easy, simple, words can no longer describe it.  what can you say about it.  I t is what it is.
B008WOULPK|3.0|easy read that has some interesting stories. overall the writing was fairly basic-at times jumping here and there with scattered thoughts. Something nice to pass the time if you like fashion.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I expected something more detailed.  It's a cute book but feels like a standup routine.  Love Ellen, but not this
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Absolutely addicting,,,,intriguing...you never want it to end...emotional but subtle...best series I've seen since 24 with Keifer Sutherland!  You won't regret the time spent watching it!
B00A2FSXHK|5.0|Movie gets better everytime I watch it!  The best part is the first half of the movie is good, but the second half blows you away.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|OMG!! I don't like reading, but this book is AMAZING!!! Plus it is such an easy read! This is defiantly the best book ever!!!! LOVE IT!!
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Solid movie from start to finish.  It is entertaining for everyone - from my 8 year old to the parents.

B007J2TMQ0|5.0|Outstanding for the way personal, intimate stories are woven into the broader fabric of the history of the war. I discovered facts about wars within the main war hitherto hidden from most accounts. It is also a fine anti-war work.
B0029XFNAI|5.0|LOVE this movie and got a better price on a blu-ray at Amazon than in stores for dvd!!! GREAT MOVIE AT A FANTASTIC PRICE!!!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I have read this book multiple times and often open it at any page and start reading when I feel like I need a refresher, it will certainly change your perspective on events and people.  Great book!
B005C7SXMS|4.0|Submarine is an independent film with Wes Anderson undertones about a young Welsh boy and his struggles with his parents failing marriage while dealing with the trials and tribulations of his first real girlfriend.<br /><br />The protagonist, Oliver Tate, is a high school boy that most will find relatable. Oliver isn't popular, but he isn't unpopular either. He spends his days floating through his classes and trying not to stand out in his uniform and black wool coat. The problem is, when he develops a crush on a classmate, Jordana. Jordana is a bit of a loose cannon in a bright red coat but Oliver can't help but be drawn to her. Eventually the two are brought together and their awkward relationship begins to bloom. Oliver must now juggle his parent's sinking love-life (something that he exhibits a little too much interest in) and his first real relationship.<br /><br />In terms of production, the movie is paced well. However don't expect a roller coaster ride. This is a bio-pic about a young man, his girlfriend and his parents. It's a beautiful story and very relatable. You'll cringe at the awkward moments with him and Jordana. You'll shake your head at the valiant, if a little idiotic, efforts he makes to save his parents relationship. But in the end you'll know that when you were his age, you would've done (or maybe you did) the same things.<br /><br />Filmography is where this film really shines. I stated in the introduction that this had Wes Anderson undertones. It does, but it is anything but a Wes Anderson rip off. It has a very vintage feel (it takes place in the 80s I think) and the color palettes are very deliberate and well done. There are many visually stunning scenes that capture the passion of young love and uninhibited youth.<br /><br />If you're feeling nostalgic for your high school days or just enjoy a good indie film, look no further.
B007EDYN36|2.0|If you insist on reading it, get it on your Kindle. Standard rock-star tripe: boring survey of childhood, lots of stories (none of them interesting) about excessvie drug use, boorish behavior, and carnality, lots of betrayal, crying, and finally religion. If you've read &#34;I Am Ozzy&#34; or &#34;Too Fat to Fish&#34; you don't need to read this.
015626224X|4.0|Orwell describes his struggle to survive in Paris during the Depression in succinct and moving language.  In London he again explains the way he, along with many other homeless men, were able to keep body and soul together in difficult times.  His failure to explain why a young man educated at Eton and from a well-off family would put himself through these horrors is, I think, a weakness and makes one wonder how much of his story is fiction.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Using my PC as a device is fine, but why can't Amazon provide a free Android App for my phone (as Netflix does) so I can view it on MY portable device ?
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I have always liked the Batman series, and the genre.  With the Aurora, Colorado event, I delayed watching it.  I am glad I still watched it.  It was worth it.

0765325950|4.0|Amazon needs to delete the 150+ 1-Star ratings left by all the whining babies who cant get it for their Kindle yet.  Those reviews have NOTHING to do with the content of the book and ONLY represent the fact that these idiots are selfish and impatient.  We've waited over 17 years for the ending, you guys can wait a couple more months if you really need to have it on your e-reader.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's an entertaining game but seems you win more often than when playing with real cards but that makes it less frustrating.
034580404X|5.0|I'm not much for books that have a lot of sex in them. I'm more of the simple romance and action but I loved these books. They are a fantastic read. I enjoyed the story line of a simple college girl finding her true love in a wealthy good looking man. To me, it feels like an adult version of a fairy tale.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This version of Mahjong looks beautiful on the Kindle Fire HD and is well worth the low price of the app. I haven't had any problem with the game shutting down on me. Working against the timer and trying to earn stars is motivating. The layouts can get very challenging. Definitely one of my favorites!

0765325950|5.0|It's hard to believe that this series has been going on for 20 years and is now at the end.  There has always been a new WoT book at some point in the future and it is sad to realize that there won't be any more.  This book has a very different feel to the other books in the series.  The other books had chapters dedicated to characters and this one jumps around a lot between characters within each chapter.  About 75% details the Last Battle.  I have to admit that it did feel a bit wearing to have so much of a book dedicated to a battle, but I think it is appropriate.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson has done an amazing job in finishing this series.  While it took him some time to learn the voice of some of the characters, he nailed most of them.  In past books, it was Mat's voice that was a bit off, for some reason it was Lan's voice that felt a bit off for me in this one.  I feel privileged to have been part of the WoT experience over these years and I'm grateful that Robert Jordan had the vision to create such an amazing series.  Thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson!

B000DWMN2S|5.0|E. A. Solinas has written a beautiful, insightful review on these pages. This is a quirky film, the cinematic equivalent of what the Germans call a \\"bildungsroman\\", a character-development novel. Liev Schreiber has raises the story development up a notch from the book, tightening up the narrative, adding new levels of dramatic tragedy and comedy, a rare talent. The music is also engaging, a bewildering mixture of apparently Russian, Ukrainian, Gypsy, and Rumanian, as one might expect from \\"Gogol Bordello\\", Hutz's group.(The Russians in my building had difficulty in determining the languages and sources.)I watched the video more than once and keep it in my permanent collection. I watch it from time to time, it reliably brings laughter to my heart and a tear or two to my eyes. I would recommend the music CD also.

0765325950|2.0|I rated this two stars because it was too bland and boring to inspire hate. It was one largely ridiculous battle (not done well) with few resolutions. Little things like a full cure for stilling seemed forgotten. Demandred just runs around shouting a lot.  Rand has largely unexplained new superpowers and the vast majority of major characters (Nynaeve, certainly) make cameos while Androl (with his own super power) runs around talking about leather and flirting with Pevara most of the book. Don't forget the cliche existential  \\"good and evil must coexist\\" moment and the personality changes.<br />And there is pointless setup for another series (Children of the Dragon) that is not to be written while real issues are ignored.<br />Also, the Shara. Despite nothing being really known about them by any commander or main character, no one asks questions or gives information. What do we know from Jordan? Despite being the main baddie here, he had said their male channelers were murdered by 21 or at the first sign of the power being present and not taught even basic skills beyond dressing/feeding  themselves. The Forsaken had previously said they couldn't be trained in time for The Last Battle because of this, even though Graendal more or less ruled them. Despite that, they show up as endless trained hordes (maybe two years later?) led by a girl with a crush on Mr. De and destroy as the superbad. Just a blatant example of disregard for Jordan's legacy, in my opinion.<br />I've read the WoT series at least five times. I'm going to pretend MoL never happened.

B008476HBM|5.0|The only way to describe this book and it's characters is literary perfection. Leaves me with a smile on my face. Every girl must read this book.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Its a very good game but it is not updated to its newest version.  Please update the game and this would be 5 stars.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|Fast delivery and good quality.

B0091REZMW|3.0|people who love finding things should get this app it helps you understand things you never knew before but its ok for me
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Best 3 bucks to spend on an app. I love the background music, and there is nothing I could possibly find wrong.
B008Y6S4XM|4.0|I like a lot of action and I love when an action movie can make me laugh too.  This movie has both and its a must see movie.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Out of all the mystery/hidden object games this is by far the best I've played yet. Started with the free version and played that then had to buy and am so loving it!!!  This has been my favorite game of all time so far!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Just another great chapter in this ever-interesting series!  This closer look at the mysterious special agent is well worth the journey, these authors don't disappoint.
B0097PW7H8|4.0|So far I like the App.  Really does what it says it should and does it well.<br /><br />My only beef is purely cosmetic.  since cases hold the kindle fire from different angles it would be nice if app would adjust to the way the device is being held.  Since my case uses left hand side and opens like a book the app is upside down when I use it.  have to flop around a bit.<br /><br />overall.. very good in my opinion.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is a great app I love it runs great no problems at all having a good time but it's not mind craft its like it but not it I love mind craft and I thank this is just as good maby Evan Beyer
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and nice to get around with.  I actually use mine on my KINDLE FIRE HD in church.  I am reading along while others are still trying to figure out what section John is in.  Amen
B002QE3CTY|2.0|This is a slow book. Nothing happens. The only reason I keep reading is because I want to know why the main character is in the maze. Unfortunately, the author basically strings you along the entire first half of the book (thats how far I have gotten), and not in a way that gives me any clues. I started reading it as a post-Hunger Games book, unfortunately it did not satisfy.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Did exactly what it said it would and very easy to use.<br /><br />As with all other ratings when I reviewed it doesn't clean up Safari, but not a big deal.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|No U.S. sports that I can find. I don't give a rip about soccer. I'll be uninstalling it if there are no U.S. sports.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This is a wonderful family movie.  My family loved it.  We watched it multiple times.  I highly recommend it for a family.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's a great read, this is my third time reading it and it still keeps me totally trapped in the storyline!!!
B008BM9L72|1.0|Friends and family recommended that I should read Fifty Shades of Grey - apparently its the new \\"mummy porn\\" I was told. I made the mistake of purchasing the trilogy and unfortunately my personality type is a \\"completer/finisher\\" so even though part way through the first book I wanted to stop reading - I felt miserable as I had to force myself to finish the whole trilogy whilst hating every minute of it. By the time we got to Little Blip in the 3rd book, my head was screaming to make it stop! These books are poorly written in my view and I cannot believe how Ana could be having orgasms every 5 minutes or so, and sometimes it appeared that all it took was for Christian to look at her - or so it seemed. Their relationship is twisted to say the least (and I am not talking about the sex..). They seem like a couple of immature/messed up teenagers from the way they spoke and even their thoughts seemed immature. I got really sick of Ana's \\"inner godess\\" and was totally fed up with the main characters by the end of book One (yes, book One!). The sex scenes were so frequent that I ended up just skimming over them as I didn't find them erotic anyway. I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone I actually liked and I am annoyed that I wasted my money and time reading them. I am also annoyed that I have helped the author to increase her book sales even further.
B0061PEAUY|2.0|I found this novel disappointing.  There was a lot of unnecessary &#34;fill&#34; in this book.  First we were subjected to an anatomy lesson - naming  little bones in an infant corpse.<br />Then we were given a geography lesson on the Northern region of Canada.<br />Ms. Reichs failed to draw her readers in with this novel.  Was she, perhaps fullfilling a contract that required a new book?
B00003CXE7|5.0|Not having alot of movies to do with Ancient Rome I have to say like this movie a great deal. The action, the storyline and the extraordinary acting performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix make this movie a must have.
B00884GR0W|5.0|A tip if you get stuck, on their homepage there is a chat function where you can ask for advice.  Very helpful and friendly.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Overpriced Apple product but it's not going to fail anytime (I assume) and has been reliable thus far. I'd be afraid to buy third-party on something as critical as a dongle.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I loved every one of the books in the series.  I was anxiously awaiting the printing of Two Graves.  Great writers, really keep your interest throughout their books.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Many idol winners have a style on the show and then produce totally different style albums.  This album is consistent with PP style he showed and for me is one of the best albums I've heard from anyone in a long time.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I was happy to even see a Formula 1 race during this era (pre Speed, pre F1 tv in the USA) so the soft picture just takes me back to the way it looked at the time. Remember, they didn't speed the film up for the racing sequences. They really went that fast! I did find out some details that I didn't remember hearing at the time. A tragic end to an amazing driver. One of the best.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|A decent book, It is a good story. I enjoyed it when I was actually reading it, I can't say it stuck with me afterwards though. I like the story and perspective given, I like that its spirituality portrayed by a former sceptic.<br /><br />I guess what it boils down to is whether you choose to see the book as a good story, or if you take it to heart and pursue the general message that the author is trying to get across.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|I had never seen the show before and now I have watched both the first two seasons and am hooked on the show!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|nice cute game but be careful with the gems they are pricey and one click could make you lose money
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams continue to impress me with their acting and versatile characters, and Justin Timberlake was a refreshing addition too. Some tough family drama handled well by all of them, and an enjoyable baseball movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series!!  It's the best tv I've seen in years!  The characters, costumes, settings, and story lines are wonderful!  Reality tv was never very real or very good, and am sick to death of all the violence and sexual innuendos on other shows.  I love the integrity of the characters, the romance, the subtle humor, the good manners displayed by all, and the beautiful and lavish life style that one can only dream about!  Love. This. Show!!
B003UBTX72|3.0|I couldn't get through it all the way. I was bogged down in the slang and references to places that I was unfamiliar with (and weren't explanied enough for the reader-I mean, really part of the reason we read books is to take us to places that are unfamiliar to us but a little explanation, please!)
B00884GR0W|5.0|I own Minecraft PE and love every ounce of it. That said this is everything that Minecraft PE SHOULD be. To say that this is better simply isn't expressing properly just how vastly superior this game truly is. Mobs galore, rich graphics considering the blocky nature of the game and full control of visuals and controls. I can't even begin to go on. Seriously buy this. You won't regret it and soon you'll be saying just how much Minecraft is like Block Story. Assuming you remember Minecraft at all. Five stars and I wouldn't care if it never updated!
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Very fast processor. Runs cool with stock fan and heatsink in Silverstone SG05-BB 450 case. Can't see most people ever needing more processing power than this chip can provide.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|This was a really great unexpected movie.  I can't believe it wasn't successful at the box office.  Must see. I hope they make another one.
B004GGUG58|5.0|it's just hilarious - have loved it ever since my uncle and aunt read it to us many years ago
034580404X|5.0|Great book! enjoyed very much! suggest who like such genre. And hope it will be translated into the Georgian language soon!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I purchased this game for my daughter to use and it will not download. It will eventually get to about 63% downloaded and will freeze. So we have no clue how the game is.
1426308469|5.0|... unwrapped this at Christmas and opened the book. He got so into it we had to remind him he had LOTS of other presents! He loves this book.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Probably. I haven't finished this book yet, but the part I've read seems to be true. So you can buy it.
B001C1066E|5.0|The coin purse was not only cute but adorable and I was quite pleased with it.  It arrived ahead of scheduled date.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|this book SUCKS BALLS >_< i hope the author(s) dies in a pit of acid lmfao just kidding lol love this book
B005H0IW6W|5.0|A great Christmas CD.  Some CD's not all the music is that great.  Michael Buble is the best singing christmas music.  All the songs on this CD are wonderful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is just some of the best TV ever produced. I watched all of season 1 & 2 and am now excited that season 3 has started. I look forward to each episode. The acting is stellar, the plot interesting, the characters all interesting. Michelle Dockery is fabulous in her portrayal of Lady Mary.<br />I had the opportunity to visit Highclere Castle in the UK in 2012, where much of the series is filmed. We went on the tour. It is an amazing place. Even more fun to watch the show now and recall standing in many of the rooms used in the series.<br />Highly recommended if you enjoy period drama at its best.
B008ELUEQC|3.0|I love Rod Stewart.  Have many of his CD's.  Not so sure about the Christmas CD.  Some artist are not meant to sing Christmas music.  I bought it - it is OK.  I so much love Rod with other music nother than Christmas
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had no idea what this book was about.  All I knew was that I had to wait about 4 months on the waiting list of my library to rent it on my kindle.  I jumped in and it gripped me from the very beginning.  It twists and turns and takes you on a journey unlike anything I've ever read.  Just when I start liking one character, it turns on a head and makes me change my allegiances. But then it twists again, and by the end, you have no idea who you're rooting for anymore.  I loved the whole book...until the end.  Which is the only reason it got 3 stars.  I was really disappointed in the ending, although, in retrospect, it was probably the most fitting ending for the lives of these strange and messed up characters.
B006O3MU96|3.0|Fun game but I can't really follow how to follow along and play it correctly. I just keep pushing the button hoping he doesn't fall.  Lol!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its an amazing game just was wondering when the next update is. should buy it before it gets to expensive
0345803485|2.0|Twilight made me gag. Though I enjoy the movies. I couldn't stand reading the phrase \\"edward's cold sweet breath\\"  Then come's gray's eyes, smirks, Ana biting her lip and turning crimson. Barf. The potential is there but omg.  Smirk one more time.  Or bite your lip and Christian will offer to bite it for you <gag>
1400052181|2.0|This was recommended by a doctor friend.  I found the basic theme to be interesting, but only about a quarter to a third of the book was devoted to the science.  The rest was essentially a lugubrious lament that the relatives of the unfortunate woman whose tissue had been used to culture a line of cells used extensively in scientific research did not receive the untold wealth to which they imagined that they were entitled.  They had done absolutely nothing to merit any payment, and Ms. Lacks, whose tissue was used, was a charity patient in Johns Hopkins Hospital, and paid nothing for her extensive medical treatment for cancer.  But numerous individuals in her family saw this as an opportunity for a payoff.  Ms. Skloot used most of her pages to describe these dysfunctional people.  Only one or two were reasonably likeable.
1449433251|5.0|Bought this for my fiancé for Christmas and needless to say, he loved it!! He especially enjoyed the introduction :)
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Wonderful movie - incredible performances by a stellar cast in a beautiful setting.  Profound and touching in so many ways.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Interesting hidden object game. You can spend a lot of time in all of these rooms.<br />Download for lots of fun at a great price ---- free!!!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Loved this movie - as exciting and action packed as all of the other Bourne movies.  Well worth watching if you are a fan.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game=] There's nothing I don't like about this game. I first tried Angry Birds on my mom's phone and I was immediately hooked.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Great cast and acting, but too gruesome for me.  Also, it just felt like something was missing or perhaps it just wasn't what I was expecting.
1568654243|1.0|5  hours I'll never get back in my lifetime...  The movie is DEFINITELY far better an entertainment value.  The book itself is worth using it in the forest, instead of leaves.... You can tear half the pages out and still get bored reading this poorly written page turner... There's nothing of added value; and as for the &#34;different&#34; ending.. there's no such thing.. the movie's ending is merely a subset of what the book offers...  (in the book 5 people travel to Vega...)  but the book adds very little to the plot or subtext... the book is a throw-away...
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I really did not know much about Lincoln's cabinet prior to reading this book.  Now I really feel like an expert on not only the cabinet, knit Lincoln's ability to manage the men that made up this esteemed group.  Somehow  may say it is a bit long but a shorter narrative would certainly miss many of the subtle points that are necessary for completeness.  NOW I can go to see the movie!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have been a fan of Tom Clancy since the 1990s and I am glad that he seems to have recovered his style.
0425166805|2.0|When Däniken, and defenders of the theory of the ancient astronauts have talked about their beliefs that the ancient gods were  aliens, Ok, as an atheist and physicist I think I can digest this.<br /><br />But when we watch some of them on History Channel saying that the aliens were created by some kind of god too, oh come on, this is laughable to say the least.<br /><br />To me, some of them(the dumb ones) are trying to replace one empty faith(religion) by another one even worse.<br /><br />Sincerely, I'm not going to waste my time with Däniken and all the others weird guys anymore.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|I haven't seen the show, but this was on my granddaughter's list and it<br />was mailed to her, so personally giving it a 4.
B0058YPILY|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my sister.  It arrived promptly, was well packaged (in the original packaging & with extra padding), and she said  the disks played well on both her computer and DVD player.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I'm a big fan of Kate Morton and was so looking forward to read this one.  The story itself is very good but it felt really long and drawn out in parts. A great twist at the end!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn brings Mitch Rapp to life in this spell binding book.  I would recommend this book to friends.  Can't wait for the next one.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have read most of Rick Riordan's other books and loved them. This one did not disappoint. I am 24 years old and it really sparks my imagination and sense of adventure! I am dying to go to Rome now!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought the book started off a little slow, but then, WHAM!  knocked my socks off.  Definitely not a predictable book.  Yes, I would recommend to adult friends.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Many books on diet and allergy are written from an &#34;alternative&#34; approach and do not have enough scientific evidence to back up their assertions to satisfy me, as I am a Medical Doctor. This one, written by a doctor, was full of interesting facts, and made a lot of sense about a wheat intolerance problem which I have battled to understand since I was a teenager at boarding school. Previously I had been a &#34;fussy eater&#34; and ate a lot of cheese, fruit and vegetables, meat and fish, and if I did eat cereal it was usually Cornflakes or Rice Krispies rather than wheat based cereals and bread. I never had a weight problem until I started eating bread, pastry, and other wheat products, so I was excited to find this book, and went gluten and wheat free immediately. That was several months ago. My problem now is, that although I feel better, with fewer intestinal problems and joint pains, I have put on 5kg in weight rather than losing my &#34;wheat belly&#34;! So although it is interesting, it hasn't really solved any problems for me personally.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|The book was just OK to me. It's a remake of \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\". I sure wouldn't have lost any sleep skipping this book.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Great album! Been listening on the repeats! Would love to see them live :) favorites include tiptoe, underdog and rocks - the bleeding one is cool too.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I am more of a mystery reader than a romance reader, but this book has enough of each to keep most readers interested.  It was an easy read, kept me coming back for more and had an interesting twist at the end.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B007TK77QE|4.0|So unlike the Harry Potter series, but yet still so well written and easy to read. thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|One of the best books I've enjoyed in a long time!! A real page turner!! Looking forward to Book Two!
B0056E3S4U|5.0|This is David at his best, from ballad to rock, this album is very worth the time to listen. You will not regret it.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I always been a fan of coldplay and just add to list. This album kinda takes you back to songs like whisper, yellow, the scientist, wit ha new beat. Every track is worth it.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Talking Tom has trouble picking up the sound on my Kindle Fire HD.<br />Doesn't appear to work as well as the Apple version.<br />I know the microphone is OK on my KFHD as I use frequently for Skype.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Love 'em, they are the standard in high quality audio in-my-opinion.  There really is no reason to spend any more money on headsets unless you are buying aesthetics.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|I just play the game apps to fill in time.  This is not that type of game.  Required more skill that I desired to invest.  If you are into gaming, you would probably like this and it would be a good buy.  If you are more interested in a game that is easy to learn that you can go to from time to time to fill some empty time, not so much.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app.  its like twitter almost and I love it.  I like to look at the comics and the inspirational quotes.  it also love the makeup ways and there are some other ones I love to! seriously u have to get this app like now!!!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This App is better than nothing, but it has ads that pop up that are easy to accidentally click on which takes you off FB and waste your time.  I understand the Ads are necessary, but it would be nice if it could be done is a less obtrusive way.  Since this is what's out there, that's what I go with, but I wish it were better.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Loved the soft lovely voice and listened to it a lot of times during the Christmas Season.  Would recommend it for others.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Don't understand some of the critics here...\\"Ain't Messin' 'Round\\", \\"When My Train Pulls In\\", \\"Bright Lights\\" and \\"Travis County\\" are alone worth the price. Add to that the truly fine Retro Soul of Please Come Home\\" and \\"Things Are Changing\\" and this is a steal. But it doesn't end there, paying tribute to Hendrix is no easy task and a failure to many but Gary masters the master here in fine form on \\"Third Stone From The Sun/If You Love Me Like You Say\\". He's clearly this generation's Hendrix at best and a stellar song writer and master musician in the least! How anyone could be disappointed in this release is a puzzle to me...Is every song immediately catchy? No but given a few listens they quickly grow on you. I think it's a knock-out punch from start to finish! Well done, Gary!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Hate all the advertising I have to go through to get to the game.  The game is great and I love playing after I finally get to it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|She loved it! She was able to load it on her computer for future watching as well as watch it with the family on the TV. Good movie - lot's of action and some humor for the old folks.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once again 's Collins keeps us turning page after page wondering the fate of these colorful characters.  This is such a fun and exciting trilogy meant for a wide range of readers.
0765325950|1.0|The book was predictable in execution, but the only question was how Mr. Sanderson would attempt to wrap up a few of the 150 plot strands that are blowing about in the breeze. He really did well in the position he was in, trying to make the fans, the widow, and the publisher happy.<br /><br />The series lost steam around book 4. Perhaps it was too ambitious, for it rambled too long and wandered too far from where it seemed to be going in books one and two. Minor characters were given hundreds of pages to interact with people that have almost all the same name, but then major characters are not mentioned in 600 pages. It seemed more to fit the author, stand-in author, and widow's needs more than the reading public's. Being the editor, Harriet should have taken the red pen out a long time ago and told Robert to focus on one or two plot lines, save the many very minor characters for the cutting room floor. Or keep the detail, and make the WOT series into 3 different sub-series. I argue it would have given the adventure more focus, and perhaps Mr. Jordan would have more bestsellers.<br /><br />I have not doubt if Mr. Jordan was alive and finished the series, it would have topped out around the 17 to 20 book range, we would have had about 2500 minor characters dressed in brocaded silks, pulling their braids, and not being able to puzzle out the opposite sex. I would be continually going to the wiki site to recall who everyone is.<br /><br />I bought all the books as hardcover and audiobook. The exception being this last one, I refuse to buy hardcover and am listening to it on audiobook.<br /><br />To sum up, the series started off at 5 stars, slipped to 4 around the midway point, went to 2 or 3 at Winter's Heart, and the ebook debacle knocks this one down another couple points to the 1 star.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have not played, but my kids do. This Angry Birds is different than others and they love it! Worth getting!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is a great movie to watch in 3D. Love it. thank you.<br />You won't be disapointed.  I give it 5 stars
B0070Y46UY|4.0|MARTELS DESCRIPTIONS OF ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, PHILOSOPHY, RELIGION AND THE COURAGE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT CAPTURE YOU. A VERY ENJOYABLE READ!
B000W178XO|5.0|a great collection of Cash tunes spanning his career. Cash fans will have all the congs on this album already but if you only want to buy one  Cash album this would be the one.
B00957T6X6|5.0|It's a brilliant series of books where you are never sure of anything, you can never guess where the storyline is going. The excitement keeps you going. Martin has a great voice throughout the book. Two of the things I like best, is the world does not exist purely through magic; magic is something that is only in stories, yet it seems to be coming back into the world. Secondly I love how vast the world is and how the chapters are divided into the different characters spread across the wide world all caught up and tangled in someone else's stories and lies. Definitely makes for an exciting read. Well worth it!<br /><br />Stop considering and go for it! After all, winter is coming.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I bought this game with such high hopes and was really disappointed. After spending several evenings gathering the items needed to finish the game, at the end it froze and I had to restart it.  To be fair the graphics are lovely and I did enjoy the music, however I really don't want to invest all that time again redoing all the things I did before.  Also had to keep referring constantly to the hint guide to figure out what I was suppose to do next which gets annoying as it's not easily accessible (at least on my Kindle Fire.) Buttons didn't capture my finger and I would have to constantly press over and over to get to the guide.<br /><br />A on the looks of the game but D - on programming.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Its just the same joke over. Its funny at first, but it gets old real quick. If you have seen the trailer, you have seen the movie.
B00004BZ16|5.0|A fantastic album that was originally issued as a 3 vinyl disc package loaded with some Clash favorites along with some stellar little gems that never found the air waves. Do yourself a favor and pick up this nice little treasure and play it as much as you can!
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|the game is great but it takes up way to much memory which is why I only give it a two.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so good that I could not put it down!  Every page was something unexpected.  It was one of the best reads in a long time!!!!  I will read more of Gillian Flynn!!!!
B002TJLEY6|5.0|Excellent read, very informative and helpful with useful facts and information on many neurological disorders. easy to understand and plenty of tried & tested recommendations.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. It was my first Kindle experience and I have told everyone I know, who has one, to get this book.
6303921248|5.0|For those who are fans of Victorian times life,  this 6 part series will not disappoint. The story takes place in England in the 1800's about the everyday life and loves of a family with 4 daughters. The music is wonderful  throughout. A must see for the whole family.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Every song on this album is great.  Once you hear the opening note, you are swept away in a vivid audio experience.
B000006IUQ|3.0|we received this movie a few weeks ago and although it had some pretty heavy scratches on it, I was able to fix them before giving to my husband for CHristmas.  He has been searching everywhere for this movie.
B0031RSA24|5.0|very nice book. it deals in detail with many topics that are fascinating. needless to add Dawkins has nailed it pretty y well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I absolutely loved this game on my kindle fire. Great graphics and storyline. The mini games were very fun as well. I definitely recommend this game.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Great perspective! Creative and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Better for a younger, teenish audience.  Can't wait to see the movie.  The e n d.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|This is the first digital art program I've used and I like it a lot. It took a little getting used to because I previously didn't know anything about creating digital artwork, only traditional, but it didn't take long for me to get the hang of it. I love the different brushes and the fact that the marker tool behaves the way a real marker would (light color won't cover up dark, blue over yellow makes green, etc.) You can have up to 4 layers to work with and it's easy to move back and forth between them.<br />The only thing I wish this program had was texture overlays. There are some splattered and dots that you can use to create interesting backgrounds, but no effects to make the picture look like fabric, paper, aged, etc. I kind of expected that sort of thing to be included, but maybe that's not standard for painting programs.<br />As a newbie to the digital art world, this works well enough for my needs and I would recommend it for new and intermediate artists.
B00979CS50|4.0|If you like Neil with the Horse, you have to love this one. If you don't like Neil with the Horse, why did you buy it?
B007M45PMU|5.0|I found this album on amazon in May 2012, and I honestly still listen to this album almost every single day. I never get tired of it. It's not just filled with a couple hits, the entire album is great.
B009FOBZL0|5.0|The wallflowers new album is great! Hospital for sinners is my top pick. One of the first concerts I went to was the Wallflowers and have been a fan for years. Jakob's voice is as honest and cool as his gorgeous baby blue eyes.
B000O599ZS|5.0|Product was as described! It arrived on time and it was packaged correctly. Great movie for anyone to enjoy anytime
B002KV8NQ0|5.0|love tattoo the cover song is great, but the entire album is really good. Melda May is an Ireland native but you can't hear any accent at all in her singing and she's got her rockabilly down!
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Annoying pop ups.  Repetitive gameplay.  Having to beg strangers to add you to a friend list. Terrible and rude customer support!  Also watch out for gem traps.  If you accidently buy or spend gems earned you won't get it reversed.  It is easy to make a mistake due to pop ups or a simple tap while picking up stars or coins.<br /><br />I urge you to stay away from this game.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|Somehow the selections and orchestrations on her recordings leave a lot to be desired.  Wonderful voicwe but recordings just aren't powerful.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I love it. am a big MJ fan.he is a great singer. sorry he is gone You have reasonable prices
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Captivating story. Highly recommend this book. I cannot wait to start reading the second book. A very ex citing story.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|wonderful sound and quality.The movie was exciting and wonderfully made.I enjoy watching it on this kindle fire vs. I would recommend thus.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This app is great and works fine. My wife and I both play this game with all of our friends and family. Unfortunately we play it mostly on our phones because this version isn't up-to-date enough. It doesn't include some of the latest features like trading bombs to get special words that are worth more coins. Once that has been resolved this review will be 5 stars.
B0010OIN90|5.0|This watch is well made and leads to creativity.  My grandson embellished this watch with his own Lego pieces to create a &#34;spy watch&#34;, a &#34;camera&#34;, and other things.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I was absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity to make this purchase.  I love Led Zeppelin, and was sad that I didn't have the chance to attend this concert, but love that I can still watch, and listen to it and feel like I'm there.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Glad that it arrived and was in perfect condition, now I can enjoy all of my bones series all together
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Really liked this book.<br />Makes your mind explore.<br />Couldn't stop reading it and the ending made me start reading the second book immediately.
B0001E5TSS|1.0|This is the first time I've ever ordered anything from Amazon that I was not pleased with.  I ordered this movie as a Christmas gift for someone who had always wanted to see it.  When she plugged it into her player, it wouldn't play, but displayed a pop-up message with something like, &#34;This movie is for a region other than the one that you're in.&#34;  I was thoroughly embarrassed, but had no idea what to do since neither of us had ever heard of such a thing.<br /><br />Very disappointed.  I've seen the movie and it's a wonderful classic, but this &#34;region&#34; thing was a rip-off.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I would rate this book about 3 stars it was a pretty good book but I've read better but it was a good book
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it .. couldn't wait to read the other two and then start the series again. Didn't watch the movie until after I read it
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is the best game I ever played and I am not really into tycoon games but this one is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i read them in a week that is fast for me.  i hope you all enjoy it as much as i did.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I kept wanting to know what was going to happen it only took me two days to read it
B000V63BN6|5.0|Stevie wonders great Old school music the Definitive Collection nothing like it my family loved some stevie wonder I would highly recommend listening to his music he keeps it real
030758836X|1.0|Let me count the ways I hated this book:<br />1) The characters were not only not believable but not likable. By the middle of the book, I didn't care what happened to either protagonist.<br />2) The story is told, completely told. All writers know that good books show don't tell--they show the readers in order to help them feel, sense, become part of the action. This book does none of that. It tells and tells more. It violates every rule of good writing<br />3) I knew I was reading fiction. In fact I never left my couch; I wasn't whisked away to some fictional spot(The mark of good fiction). Instead I knew I was reading fiction because no one can do what you are lead to believe. Nope, not in real life!<br />4) I went into the book knowing the ending sucked, but I couldn't believe it. The only reason I kept reading and didn't toss it in the trash was I wanted to see how the author tied everything up. Well, she didn't. She just stopped. The ending was neither an ending nor was it satisfying. So, if you read this and think you'll be satisfied in the end, forget it.<br /><br />I'm annoyed that I got hooked into this book because of the reviews and the raves. I say readers beware. This book is not worth your time. Read something really good like the Dovekeepers by Alice Hoffman.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game that is relatively mindless without being stupid--engaging and challenging. A friend recommended it and I really enjoy it
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is the wondrous story of a young and talented musician, whose career tanked in his own country, but was, unknown to him for years, discovered and cherished in another country thousands of miles away. This film is witness to his rediscovery, and his uniting with his faithful fans in South Africa, where he had been, and endures, as a legend of classic proportions.<br /><br />It would have all be for naught, if not for the fact, that Rodriquez's music was, and remains today, so moving and evocative of his still gritty and frank point of view. Technically it's mature and well conceived in composition and melody. It still evokes after all these years.<br /><br />And his attitude to all this very recent attention is itself something to appreciate. He remains the humble and quiet laborer, and faithful to the life he has lived. The film gives one food for thought. It's unusual in this way, and well worth the purchase.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|G5 another hit ... Great story &amp; graphics.  Two big game progamers G5 &amp; Big Fish knocking it out of the block G5 wins this round. Please please do this Again!!!
B005D0RDKC|5.0|This series introduces you to a lot of the lesser-known, but still classic, Cash takes on songs. If you like Cash, you'll love the Bootleg series!<br /><br />And this one introduces you to places, crowds and even Johnny's stylings of various songs that you've probably never thought you'd experience.<br /><br />I'd make this a &#34;must have&#34; for all Cash fans.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you liked the first book then you will find that this book will answer a lot of questions.  Looking forward to reading the next book.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I was hooked in the first 10 pages. I went on to read the entire series and actually like Nesbo's books better than Stieg Larsson's. Harrry Hole is an endearingly flawed protagonist and Nesbo's writing is crisp, taut, and never dull. Can't wait for the next one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not a real Sci-Fi / fantasy fan but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was very easy to become involved with these characters.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This movie was more violent than I expected.  Some of the story was a bit confusing too, but I guess that can happen where time travel is involved.  On a high def TV the way they altered Joseph Gordon-Levitt's face so he looked more like a young Bruce Willis was obvious and a bit distracting at times.  Overall the movie was okay, I'm glad I rented instead of seeing in the theater, though.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't say 100%, but I'm pretty sure that Colleen Hoover must have read The Sea of Tranquility by Katja Millay not too long before writing (or perhaps while writing) Hopeless. Read Hopeless, you'll see what I mean. It's not a bad thing though.<br /><br />Hopeless was everything that I dreamed it would be once I heard Colleen Hoover say she was releasing another book but one more dark in nature. I'm not sure I can compare Hopeless to Slammed/Point of Retreat because they are two very different creatures with very different circumstances and very different characters. I might have emotionally been connected with Will and Lake slightly more than Sky and Holder, but only just slightly.<br /><br />As with Slammed and Point of Retreat, Hopeless has plot twists and such that can't be spoiled for the potential reader. Some of these twists are a bit more visible in their revelation for me in Hopeless than in Slammed or Point of Retreat. But I won't spoil them. I can't. As I experienced with The Sea of Tranquility (my review), even when I was pretty certain I knew what happened, I still wasn't sure. I still had questions. Colleen Hoover did a wonderful job of keeping me feeling like the earth was constantly tilting from one side to the other.<br /><br />All is not as it seems. And everything has it's reason.<br /><br />Beautifully written and fast paced, I couldn't put Hopeless down. I stayed up until 2:45 am one morning reading in the bed because I just couldn't stop. Well... until I hit this one section and I emotionally needed a break (and sleep). At which point I slept for a few hours, then woke up and laid in the bed until I finished.<br /><br />Hopeless did not disappoint. Everything you've come to expect from Colleen Hoover's writing was here and more. I'm giving Hopeless 4.9 Stars. Have you read Hopeless? If not, please do, but read The Sea of Tranquility by Katja Millay first (that's not a must, just my personal recommendation). If so, what did you think? Let me know!<br /><br />P.S. After you've read Hopeless, read the \\"the best fist kiss\\" from Holder's POV that she posted on her website. HHHHHHOOOOOOTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!know!<br /><br />P.S. After you've read Hopeless, read the \\"the best fist kiss\\" from Holder's POV that she posted on her website. HHHHHHOOOOOOTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!
B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie is very entertaining and provided insights unknown to me.  The cast is amazing: Colin Firth as King George VI<br />Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, and Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth
B007JOM7C4|2.0|I got it for my niece. Minus the language. But I ended up liking the song Pearl and other songs.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|Purchased for someone who really enjoys British productions.  It was a bit slow in places, but overall enjoyable. Meryl Streep is fantastic.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like how challenging it can be when you get to the locked levels but I wish they would give you the hole game not just half
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|IT IS AWESOME!!!! I never read book... BUT THIS IS SOO GOOD! The makers left out a lot of information in the movie. I read it on my new Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;
1401322786|5.0|The book was wonderful and extreamly hard to put down.. I bought this for a friend and I got the same respnse from her.<br />The book was delivered on time, not even all the holiday mail delayed it.  I would and do remomend this book to all my friends and family and well as the seller..<br /><br />Thank you so much,  (still waiting on a bood as good as this)<br />Lisa
B003NFM3JK|4.0|Love that this is a Disney movie not geared towards kids. It's darker, sticks to Dickens's script, and has some great actors doing the voices. Love it!
B006OFN0SE|5.0|A wonderful interpretation of the life of J. Edgar Hoover and you will not believe that the star of this movie was the kid from the Titanic.  It brings back all the rumors of Hoover being gay and  keeping secret files on all the Presidents or their wives.  And that probably went on.  Ever wonder how he kept his job under 8 different Presidents?  The period costumes, scenery , autos, buildings were all done flawlessly.  The movie depicts Hoover as a walking basket case of psychological contradictions but when all is said and done, Hoover turned the fledging FBI from where they couldn't even carry guns and people laughed at their attempts to have a fingerprint database into the sophisticated, state of the art agency it is today.  Could somebody else have done it?  We don't know.  But we know that Hoover did do it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|My purse was always stuffed with notes - grocery lists, details about things to shop for - such as the size of the sliding door that I want to get blinds for, authors that I want to look for at the library or other.  I am so pleased to have a place to put these notes that synchronizes between my PC, my android phone & my Kindle.  The phone is nearly always with me  to view my notes but I can type them on my PC and they show up on each device. (I hate typing on my phone - Kindle not so bad.)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought the charaters seem like everyday people, i could relate to.once I started reading I could'nt stop.I  recomend this  a must read.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is an incredible book.  Everything we need to know in order to understand how to show love and be certain the other person feels that love.  I highly recommend this book.  It is an incredible tool for anyone to use, even if your significant-other does not.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love the whole series.  It is delicious!  love the dresses, the whole look of the castle, and all the characters.
B0026SFEW8|4.0|Both classic and dated as the music trumps the plot and performances. My memory of the first time I saw it was better than the reeat veiwing several years later.
0894803123|5.0|The recipes in this little book were amazing.  They were easy to make and the taste was out of this world.  I have made ice cream for years and used old family recipes but these are new and fresh and taste great.  I would recommend this little book to anyone who loves ice cream.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so full of emotion that it drained me.  I felt for the characters and loved the way it was written.  The author had a humor that stayed even when the emotions got high.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil the plot, but if you want a book that you can't put down, this is it.  This is one heart twisting storyline and it brought to life with characters that people can relate to.  I don't cry often being a guy, but this one brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />My advice if you like an entralling story, READ THIS!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great for fans of all ages! It is still fun to play even if you don't spend real money on it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book and will read it over and over. RJ did a wonderful job of expressing the feelings of a 10 year old boy. Readers will not be able to put this down. That is a garuntee
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I like this version of angry birds. It has my favorite bird,  the pink bird.  It changes with almost every holiday. That means new levels and new birds. The thing I don't like is it uses REAL MONEY on some things. STOP THE STUPID POP UPS!
B005LAIGPU|4.0|&#34;Found footage&#34; is all the rage these days, and why not... it works!  You can do nearly anything with it.  This film could have been terrible, but I thought the story was really good.  The film-making was even better.  Definitely worth at least a 3-day rental, if you haven't seen it already.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Although originally from New York, they got their name once in Colorado.....Support Colorado Bands, great CD, worth the mp3 cost, down fall is you do not get the lyrics, but can find them online easily.
B005LAII8A|5.0|Rian Johnson nailed it.  He nailed JG-L as Bruce Willis' younger self.  He nailed the human elements of the story.  He didn't go overboard with special effects, and he said just enough about time travel to say &#34;that's not what the story is about&#34;.  Good for him!  The more I see of JG-L, the more I like him.  His role in 500 Days of Summer was outstanding, and there's just enough of that sensitivity in this one.  Looper was easily one of the best sci-fi films of 2012, and was also in the conversation (certainly Top 20) for films overall.
1419705849|4.0|My grandson was so happy to have received this book as a Christmas gift.  Both he and his older sister have read every Wimpy Kid book.
1451648537|5.0|I got this as a gift for my husband, who's a big fan of Steve Jobs, and he loved it! The book arrived a day late but still it arrived in great conditions.
1423107233|5.0|This book is amazing! I would recommend this for the Disney collector as well as the artist that might be interested in Animation!
B000NDIAWO|3.0|I like the album it had 2 cds with some spanish songs.  its very good and I enjoy llistening to i tI also like Beyonces music R&B sound.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|I first saw this as a play at a college theatre when I was young. Adore both these actors and the story is rich. Absolutely one of my favorite films.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This is a 4 disc collection with inclused 3 CDs and 1 DVD.  The CDs have some unreleased stuff and the DVD has a concert on it which was unreleased on DVD before.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the show, and I liked that I can watch it on any device with my amazon account. I just think that it was better quality when I ordered it through playstation network and downloaded it right to my playstation. I now own all of the episodes, and do not need to steam them.
B001041JLE|5.0|Theiller is my favourite album and I love to hear outtakes and remixes form it. This album has three things of what I love about Thriller the album, song and outtakes.  If you liek Thriller and want a bit more this for you.
0061992860|5.0|Nice little book with great ideas and info for staying alive in any environment.  The 1st part of the book should be read for prepping the correct items and getting some basic water collection plans.  The rest of the book deals with specific environments and can be used as needed.  Small enough to carry with you.
B000NA2776|5.0|I enjoy this album is so up beat and fun to listen to.  Especially Grace Kelly thats one of my favourites.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I enjoyed this story but wasn't impressed by the writing like I thought I would be. Suspenseful despite knowing the story;however, some parts dragged on and on. You may enjoy it more if you don't have the movies with which to compare it.
B0093OGBL6|4.0|This is a great read and I would highly recommend this book.  The author meets Michael Jacksons former bodyguards and has some very interesting stories to tell about Michael Jacksons personality.  Also there is information about Michael Jacksons children and there personalities. Some of the book repeats the same informatino throughout and its not good fromt aht point of view.  Otherwise I found that at parts I cried at, laughed at and was mad at.  Especially those about teh allegations.  But all of the facts are that and it seems to be written by a fan so its all positive.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|The CD was in great condition and an amazing album. Frank Ocean is awesome! He put a lot into this album and its on replay all the time.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Great to have all of Mcihaels Jacksons hits on one CD I really enjoy it and I this one has one extra track called one More Chance.
1426209584|5.0|This &#34;end table book&#34; makes a great gift for someone special,.  I highly recommend it, we gave it for Christmas to grandaughter and her husband, they were thrilled with it.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I really enjoy this game. Its so fun trying to get a dragon you want really bad and rewarding to see your work pay off. My only completes are how unclean the lines are compared to other devices.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|From the non-stop action in Part one, to the unfolding of the story of Helen, this has to me my favorite Prendergast novel.  The reader is treated to explanations of eventsthat happened in the past and surprised at the stories of previously unknown events.  This is truly a must read for fans of our FBI hero.<br />And, true to form, events unfold that will lead to numerous additional stories.  Preston and Child are unique storytellers  that never always provide stories that are difficult to put down; however, this is the best to date.<br />In order to truly enjoy this last book of the Helen trilogy you must read the previous two books.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I picked up The War of Art after a friend mentioned how powerful it was to him. We're both creative people, and he talked about how impactful this call-to-arms book was on his art creation process, so I snapped it up on Amazon at my earliest convenience.<br /><br />The great thing about Steven Pressfield is that he writes like he's a friend I've known since I was in Kindergarten. It feels like he's leaping through the pages to keep me honest about why I create, what I create and how I use my time.<br /><br />A running theme in the book is the enemy of &#34;Resistance,&#34; which will redefine how you approach writer's block and lack of inspiration. He's phenomenally inspiring, a true pro author and an honest voice that stands out in a sea of otherwise wishy-washy self-help writing books.<br /><br />Pressfield is famous for his military fiction, and it shows. In The War of Art, he plays the weathered veteran while you and I sit at his feet as green-horn privates fresh from bootcamp as he passes on old knowledge and wisdom to the next generation of warriors for art.<br /><br />It's an absolutely brilliant read. I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who does anything with their life. Teacher, small business owner, fisherman, hunter, marketer ... everyone should read this book.<br /><br />5 stars!
B001QKSWOE|5.0|It was great.  Just like all of Janet Evanovich's books.  It is very nice to be able to us Amazan to buy my books.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|i received this for christmas  i am still learning how to use it  but i do believe my recent purchases from amazon are going to be amazing !!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this is the best alarm people can have there's a large selection of tones also it tells the weather at the same time.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I love pac- man and when I say I could get it on my kindle I was very excited. However, once I got on to it I say that I shouldn't have wasted my memory on it. It has difficult controls and only lets you play about half way through level two. Also, to get the full version, you have to pay.
0618154043|5.0|I purchased this book for my grandniece for<br />Christmas.  She &#34;loved it!&#34;  When a teenager<br />&#34;loves&#34; a book it must be great!
B008MEM24S|3.0|game is great. would give 5 stars if I didn't keep getting an error message when I try to purchase the additional chapters. please fix!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love this book & it's suspense! I couldn't put it down! Can't wait for the movie to come out next month
B0054XOMX4|3.0|This was a gift for Christmas, I have no earthly Idea what to rate this Item. Looks like it could be fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great read, VERY well written..  I was sad when it was over because I just wanted the story to keep going..
B00APUQT7I|4.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone. it was very entertaining. I would definitely see it again without any hesitation.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Top notch App! Great App!  I would highly recommend this app to anybody who owns a Kindle Fire HD. Ye!
B008ASLNN2|5.0|This movie is full of action and truly riveting.  Lots of funny dialogues and scenes and love the actors and potrayal of characters.  Good directing and cinematography.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Read this in less than a week. I think you shouldn't let your past predict your future. I would recommend this book
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|We very much enjoyed this movie.  Full of action, lots of funny scenes and drama.  Highly recommended to friends and family.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game can't wait to get all the little ponys. Super cute and lots of fun to play.
B005K01VZS|5.0|A wonderful, moving story which reminds us that even though we are different we are all connected... it brought tears to my eyes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVED book brings you in and let's you fantasize about your own desires and limitations and those of your partner. Hated is not a strong enough word for ending. HOPING book two helps finish the story.<br />Sincerely,<br />Teresa L. Moser
B00908DDZM|5.0|Bought it based off of the song Thrift Shop and now I'm in love with every single song. Every song is a little bit different. Some of the guest artists are great as well. Also bought Allen Stone's album just because his voice is so amazing on Neon Cathedral. Enjoy!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really like this game I can leave it and it will progress without me having to go in and collect anything. I'm a busy mom so I don't have to stay glued to it I can stop where I'm at anytime and go back to it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|this is a great show and can't wait for season 3. Had a Downton Abby dinner i was so inspired by the shows.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|It was a great set and all the features were terrific. The clarity and color were excellent as was the sound quality. Try it, you'll like it
B005LAII08|5.0|This movie was fun to watch. The blu-ray gave us great picture quality. You can not go wrong with a Pixar movie.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|cute movie... great story  we all enjoyed it a lot... great for whole family :) :) :) :) :) :)
B0057R5XRG|4.0|This was a great set that contained all of the movies. It was a gift so I am going of their experience when they say it was great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A person doesn't watch this series for Action Adventure or situational humor. Maybe it is the lack thereof in this series that makes it such a standout now on American TV. I love this quiet drama. I love the use of language, the nuanced exploration of class and station, and of course, the attention paid to the sets and costumes. Season three begins with a resolved conflict between two of the main characters that went on for the first two seasons, so it feels like major new plot threads are starting and I can't wait to see where the writers take the story. BTW the writer for DA, Julian Fellowes, is the same for [[ASIN:B000IKQMFO Gosford Park]], so if you liked that movie and other period pieces of early 19th century, you will probably love DA as I do.<br /><br />BTW I watched the first two seasons for free with Amazon Prime with my [[ASIN:B007KEZMX4 Roku HD Streaming Player]]. That was so much easier than having to wait for Netflix to send the disks.
B008XBASVY|5.0|This movie was much more engaging than I would have thought and I recommend that everyone watch. Colfer's character is funny and real, as are the other characters. Very genuine story.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|Works great with all my foscam cameras. Has some extra controls that sets it above some of the other apps out there. Keep up the good work.
B005ZUR724|5.0|same as wow. takes some time to get used to movement but good game. worth the price. wish I knew about it a while ago
B001P9EQH8|3.0|When I received this product, I immediately plugged it in for a charge and it did take about two hours for a full charge like it said it would. Once charged, I tried it on a couple of my tablets and mp3 players. It amplified the signal clearly for my devices that could not power my more powerful headphones and the signal was clear and not distorted. The Flat and Bass settings did little to change the signal, which was not a real problem as I used the equalizer settings on my devices and it translated well. The volume control does not increase volume significantly and so you would still need to rely on the volume control of your device if you need for it to increase significantly.I did have problems with devices that had enough amplification to power my high end headphones though in that the sound would distort and volume would decrease. The solution was obviously to not use the amplifier on these devices. It is small, relatively portable and easy to use and it amplifies well. It just doesn't do much more than that.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Mahjong is one of my favorite games.  This rendition is progressive and fun if you like match games. The tiles are big enough to see what's on them.  Lots of fun all day.
B001DMJAM8|4.0|The performances by Gideon Kramer are somewhat variable, some needing more bite, but the set offers very good value for Piazzola fans.
B008476HBM|4.0|You really need to use your imagination with this book.  Not because the book is badly written, but you have to let yourself go an imagine what it would be like and visualize this in your mind.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Enjoyed a walk into the past.  Scary thoughts of what can happen with just small changes.  Stephen King can still keep my attention.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|My teenage Granddaughter put this in my wish list and forgot about it.<br />She was surprised I remembered to but it for her for Christmas.<br />She loves it!!!
1423140605|5.0|my son was thrilled to see the mark of athena under the christmas tree this year.  he said that it was a good read and he managed to finish it in about 3 days over the holiday break.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I am in level 15 have not bought no peanut yet. Using Kindle Fire no problems at all. Have fun playing.
B003TT2X72|1.0|In \\"what do you get?\\" it says that it includes both the theatrical release and the extended edition. It does not include the edition. It is a single sided disc with the theatrical edition only. I am returning my copy.
B001A3AA0G|5.0|I love this album! It is a soulful mix of sixties and modern indie. Fleet Foxes make some of the best music out there, and this album does not disappoint. Although I love every track, my favorites are Tiger Mountain Peasant Song, Blue Ridge Mountains, Sun it Rises, and Oliver James. You will not regret buying this album!
1440503257|4.0|I bought this book on a whim and enjoy it. I tried the Yorkshire Pudding recipe and it is wonderful! There are many recipes that look like a lot of fun to make. Definitely one to add to your collection if you are looking for authentic British food.
0425252868|5.0|He is a big fan of war stories and planes.  He has been engrossed in this book since he got it  today.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|love this movie--blue ray is definitely the way this should be watched. wish it came with the digital copy though
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|From the moment he started his walk and the different types of people he meets on his journey, good, bad and indifferent, you just want him to succeed.  This book elicited so many different emotions, some funny and some very sad. You could sense his frustration and the many times he wanted to give up and just go home.  His story is so much like our lives..happiness, sadness, frustration, disappointment in people we think we know and what we can learn from the people we least think we can learn from.  I have recommended this book to so many people and those who read it loved it as I did.
1451695195|1.0|Dr Alexander states he is a Christian, yet says that there are many ways to heaven which flies in the face of what Jesus himself stated which is that \\"I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\\" John 14:6. And \\"For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.\\" Matthew 7:14.<br />Jesus Himself would tell Dr Alexander that he is most definitely not a follower, not a Christian. In his book,  Dr Alexander may have realized that consciousness is indeed eternal, but he is deceived in thinking that all roads lead to God.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|It's a nice game when I'm on down time.<br />Graphics are descent, looks good on my phone and kindle.<br />Rather just by the game and earn credits vs buying a silly package, of various amounts of dollars. If not for that, I would have gave u 5 stars vs 3.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Plays just like the original, tons of fun and all of the controls are very smooth for a tablet RPG. Highest recommendation.
034544678X|5.0|Very readable.entertaining book to start with.  The author's accreditations are very substantial. and this gives authority to the advice offered. The book interprets  the many anecdotes soundly and from experienced that is easy to relate to and recognize.  Guess I loved the book because it backed up many of my own intuitive beliefs of getting along with dogs and explains why this would be so.  I feel much reassured from reading it and hope that it will benefit many other dogs and handlers to happy, comfortable relationships.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|My dad bought my mom this cd for hanukkah and both she and I &lt;3 it. we all sing along to \\"I will wait\\". luv it and very catchy.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|It is so refreshing to see older adults depicted as other than invalids.<br />The story's a little pat but so well done small shortfalls  can be forgiven.
B000067J1H|4.0|&#34;Fight Club&#34; was almost not released in the United States.  Edward Norton (Jack) develops an alter ego, which is far from Superman's savior.  Fight Club makes a psychological commentary into the wishful world of Jack and his subconscious desire to leave corporate America and its trappings.  The author's commentary shows how bizarre anyone can become to fight for his or her survival.
B00447G29S|5.0|This movie is simply a must have! I had the DVD copy and bluray is so much better. I love christmas and this movie is a staple must have!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|i like it alot it is nice to use on the go in the car or plane also a train
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read and loved all of Kate Morton's books but nothing prepared me for the wonderful ride \\"the Secret Keeper\\" provided. To date this is her best book. This is not only a love story, but a mystery, with so many twists and turns that the reader cannot put the book down. The resolution is not just surprising but comes with a jolt. All and all it makes for a very satisfying ending. I loved every bit of it.<br /><br />The story begins in the early nineteen sixties. Sixteen year old Laurel Nicholson climbs into her childhood tree house to dream about her new boyfriend. Soon she becomes distracted when she notices a stranger approaching her family farmhouse. Laurel witnesses a shocking act of violence, which nags her for the rest of her life<br /><br />Fast-forward to the present to where Laurel and her four siblings gather together at the farmhouse to celebrate her mother's 90th birthday. There Laurel tries to piece together what really happened 50 years ago when her lovely mother Dorothy viciously plunged a knife into a man.<br /><br />Now begins my favorite part of this story, wartime London, during the Blitz. Here we grow to know more about Dorothy. We meet Jimmmy, her wonderful fiance who is a wartime photographer. We acquaint ourselves with Dorothy's friend Vivian, a young married woman who lives across the street from where Dorothy works as a companion to a wealthy woman. When Dorothy is snubbed by Vivian, Dorothy seeks revenge and involves an unwilling Jimmy. \\"I suppose you want me to take this photograph, is that it?\\" asks Jimmy. Dolly replies, \\"I'm going to take the photograph.\\" She added, \\"And you're going to be in it.\\" The foreboding is chilling. The intrigue is riveting.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to family members and friends. All have loved it. A great read. I can hardly wait for Kate Morton's next book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i am so addicted to this game i play it everyday before work or after work i play it until i fall asleep
B007HACDLK|5.0|This author shows that he knows how things are run in the CIA.The theme is up to date regarding the US involment in the war on terror.I could not put down.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|i like this product because i will know what the temp will be in the city or town i will be visiting
B009TZBEKW|3.0|I was hoping to listen to some tracks that I had not heard yet. Most of the songs are already played out from the radio. So happy i got a discounted price.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. It moves at a fairly fast pace and does not require spending loads of &quot;real&quot; cash to progress.
B006R1T40I|5.0|What is there to say? Bonnie Raitt rocks and this CD did not disappoint. It was long overdue and well worth the wait.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It's so awesome I am totally gonna read the whole series! I recommend you to buy this book at all costs
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I purchased this to catch up on the series before the new season started. It is great and our family had a mini DA Sunday marathon.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game but not the fact that I can't delete the game when you can not win it. It still justs sits there on my Kindle until I ask to play again to a new game.
B000VE439Y|5.0|While many who mention Monty Python bring up &#34;The Holy Grail&#34; (as they should because it's still hilarious after all these years), &#34;Life of Brian&#34; is among their best work ever. My sixteen year old son had been asking me to buy this for him ever since the time we rented it a year ago. It's good that two generations of goofballs can both appreciate this flick. The Holy Grail is best known for its zany dialogue and one-liners (not to mention a budget that can't even buy a house by today's standards) but Life of Brian shows what the cast could do when given some money and the full command of the reins.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Simple and fun &#34;angry birds&#34; having some fun getting back at something. If you like the original game, you'll like this one too.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|Seriously, this movie is bad.  I watched this with my girlfriend, hoping for a suspenseful, supernatural scarefest.  None of the above.  The only positive aspect of this movie is Jennifer Lawrence wearing tight shirts.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|excellent!this one has it all!i was glued to my seat the whole movie.the fantasy seemed so real i could just reach out and touch it,starting right at the waterfalls at the beginning.i am a hard one to keep attracted but this really had my attention.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have enjoyed all Patricia Cornwell, Scarpetta novels.The devil's in the details and these books have it all. Well worth the read.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|movie was great but did slow just a bit,nothing major.great movie.it is hard to keep my attention to one thing for that long,but i really did like his rival in this one.
1401324649|4.0|This is a very enjoyable book. Allan Karlsson of Malmkoping, Sweden is about to celebrate his 100th birthday. This is the convoluted story of his adventures after he steps out the window as well as the story of his life. SPOILER ALERT: Minor characters include 3 US presidents, Mao, Stalin and Einstein's idiot brother.<br />You must suspend belief but it is fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was completely engrossed in this story. The characters are so richly drawn. The story itself grabs you right from the start and doesn't let go.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|The unexpected greeted me when I viewed this film.  The story of my childhood was not what I found.  Instead this is a story of evil at its opportunistic best and the real challenge and danger of overcoming it.  The stars were dazzling; the supporting cast superberb (especially since I recognized most of them from a long distinguished history of acting); the settings and photography were amazing!!!  I cringed at the witch and her ways (Charlize Theron was a very different beauty in this), gained a very different take on &#34;the mirror on the wall,&#34; and wished for a while that I could have visited the sanctuary to see the unusual animals and the Head Spirit.  This is not the film you watch once then leave on the shelf.  This is the film that you add to your film library (the ones you really watch over and over again).  Don't bypass this!  It was genuinely amazing.
B005KELW26|2.0|Did not realize at time of purchase it would not fit my Fire HD. It is really nice, but can't use it.
0547482655|5.0|It's a large artsy book written in French and a classic story which I bought for my teenager who is in her second year of French. She loves the book.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I am a fan of Seth McFarlane's Family Guy and American Dad series and I still went into this film with zero expectations and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how funny it was. This is a comedy for adults only, I have a 10 year old and I would not let him watch it, there is a lot of drug use in this film. Mark Wahlburg and Mila Kunis are a good pairing here, both are very funny. The humor is a little raunchy and crude at times but all that should be overlooked for the Flash Gordon cameo. I would recommend this if you are a fan of Family Guy or American Dad.
0312330855|5.0|Love his quaint charming country story about animals and life in the village. I highly recommend any and all of his books.
B00006AW2M|5.0|For me it's the greatest journey in time and space...a fantasy/ science-fiction album....not at all in the Stones style but brillant and priceless....
0312330863|5.0|This book is for everyone who loves country living, loves animals and loves life. I read it when I was in High School and I just bought it for my teenager.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Even better than I expected...some of the most enthralling books I've ever read. The characters continue to grow, and the new ones just as intriguing...
B008CP6RWU|5.0|All 3 of these games are great for the whole Family. the music that has been made to go with these games is great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love Peeta and Katniss! I can't wait to read the next book! District 12... well I can't say I'm too surprised but DANG!
B000I186FW|5.0|I since this movie so many times but if you ask me this movie never gets old thank for everything
B0063GORYU|5.0|Enjoy this app the most for Spider Solitaire. I recommend it for those who like to play the game. It works great!
B00AHSINKO|1.0|I was never able to see the movie, I rented it to watch on an airplane, I guess it did not download all the way, I was able to see 1 minute of it, and I only had 24 hours to see it, that was the only time I had to watch it, and by the time I was available, it was no longer an option,  I feel I should get my money back or a chance to watch it, but I can't figure out who can help me.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is so good.  It is long but I hated to see it end.  After you read it, you realize how delicate the balance of the world is.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great for passing the time though you do have to either play the same games over or buy the points to open new games
B00ARAO720|2.0|The movie lack depth and a story line. No acting required. A bicycle chase is a very limited story to tell.
0451232577|4.0|i wish to tell uou that this book was also recived on time and greatfully accepted as  a christmas gift
6305949980|5.0|Item arrived waaaaay before expected! Was afraid it would not arrive until after Christmas, but it showed up in plenty of time. Item was in excellent shape. Have watched several times, not a single scratch on the DVD. Very happy with my purchase. Very happy with the seller.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I'm writing this review bc the game told me to so I am writing and I will see what happens I guess.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|so glad i have this app.  it works great let's me know exactly how much battery i have used and how i used it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|to the creators I would like you to make it were you can blow up dinamite on creative mode please
B003INBOE2|4.0|Donnie Yen really did a good job in this movie.  His fight scenes were smooth. The story builds nicely and comes to a good  fight at the end.
B000HIVOI2|5.0|What Can you say its Stargate on Blue Ray love it. Been my favorite movie for years. And watched all the episodes of sg-1, Atlantis, universe and watched both of the other movies. Would recommend to anybody that hasn't seen it or anybody looking to watch a good sci-fi movie.
B0085A9HXS|3.0|This movies had loads of action, pretty brutal and bloody.  It is almost hard to believe some of these guys could still be fighting after the brutal beatings they took.  Like I mentioned the action kept you going even if the story did not.
B0063IH60K|1.0|This was supposed to be an app with no ads but it had them, if I wanted ads I would watch tv.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was exciting and fast paced. I loved it and i held my attention which is rare for most games
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm not sure why people think that this sucks. Some people think this doesn't download. Not true. This completely matched what minecraft is. This is a real review! I paid the 7 dollars and it worked fine. For all you minecraft players who wished they could play minecraft on the go,this is your game. Wish creative was better though.
B001706I5I|4.0|The Grinch was always one of my favorite Christmas movies. I do not own it on video so I decided to rent it on Amazon Instant Video. Always a crowd pleaser! =)
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Ted was not a great movie but I laughed my but off. Because it is so funny I recommend it.
B000I3PERS|5.0|This was an awesome price for having a great classic movie on blu ray. Would recommend to anyone who is adding to there movie collection
B009KHBDUU|2.0|I had high hopes for Dark Shadows. Depp, Burton, and Phfeifer in the same movie. It was long and boring.
0765325950|5.0|.Exquisite!  After 15 years of reading this series it has finally been finished in a way befitting the late Robert Jordan's legacy.  Reading this book was thoroughly engaging and enjoyable.  I would experience great joy one page and on the next page be crying at the lose of a character I have come to love over these 15 years.  No every question is answered and some people may feel like they want to know what the future holds for our surviving friends but, just as in life, we can never know everything that happens and we can never know what the future holds.  This book is riveting and the Wheel of Time series is a must read for any fantasy fan.  Their a neither beginnings or endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time but this is An ending!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game right here is sooooooooo fun except for the hard mission but they have good people well strong people to send out
B0001MLMKY|5.0|I love my Swatch watch.  The date number is big, making it easy to read.  The watched is &#34;attached&#34; to my wrist all day every day.  I sometimes even wear it on dress up occasions.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I'm happy I can just click and see my emails, very helpful.  I have only used it for about a week and I really like it.
0786956291|5.0|If you or someone you know is wanting to get into D&D 4e and doesn't know where to start, the Redbox was made for you/them. This comes with everything you need to start up a new character and run some encounters. One heads up is that it says it can be played with one person, which is true in a sense, but that is only for the introductory part. After they've walked you through some basic game mechanics it requires a few more people to flesh out your party. Not too big of a deal, but if you were planning on playing this with just yourself and a DM then that's something you should know ahead of time.<br /><br />That being said, D&D is a group oriented game so once you learn the basics, go find a group! I highly recommend this products to up and coming gamers. Know your roots!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It was difficult to put down.  Kept me guessing until the end.  Highly recommended to any parent of a teenager.
B00338QENI|5.0|I have been meaning to pick up this book for a couple of years and I'm so glad I finally did! I clearly remember at least learning about, if not using HeLa cells in a biology class (most likely in undergrad), but the person they belonged to was something of a footnote. Her story is fascinating, and I believe the author told it well. The concurrent storylines of Henrietta, her cells, and her children flow seamlessly, and all is told in a very truthful and respectful way. I highly recommend this if you are interested in the science, the history, or both. I couldn't put it down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was drawn in the entire time, already downloading book two, can't wait to see what happens next with katniss.
B0054XOMX4|4.0|it was for my nephew. He liked it, that's what he wanted to play with his friend and compete. thanks again.<br />moni
B008A1TIOK|5.0|I love Four Seasons and this is altogether a new experience with some original elements.  Very original, creative and totally enjoyable.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I bought this app so I could have a word document software. I can not even open it on my Kindle Fire HD. What Kind of app is this any way? I wish I could get a refund. Is anyone listening???
1419705849|5.0|I have 10 year-old twins and we pre-ordered this months in advance.  My kids are both Wimpy Kid fanatics and they couldn't wait for this book.  They actually ended up trading off every other day and both had finished it within a week.  They are now waiting for the next book.  These books are funny and have lots of simple drawings that make them seem almost like a comic book.  Kids can relate to the main characters and I have heard of MANY kids becoming avid readers after starting with these books.  I HIGHLY recommend them!  I have had to buy several of them because the school library is always out of them!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved the Movie, although my almost 2 grandson might have gotten a littel scared when the Bear came on the scene. We just kept him away during that part. great story line.
B004JMSIRC|4.0|We like this movie the best and are glad to have it on Blu-ray.  The high-def is definitely worth the extra cost!
0765325950|5.0|Just finished it and couldn't be happier. It was a perfect ending to the series. I'm absolutely thrilled.<br /><br />Those who leave crappy reviews simply because there's no ebook are jerks. Rate the book only after you've read it. Come on, people. Yeesh.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You have to use logic and really think to get the paths right....I enjoy this one a lot. It is a good game for quiet times.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|its ok but it keeps freezing. other than that its a decent game. I just hate it because right when I get into it it freezes
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's so cliche, yet it's true that this is one of those books that you can't stop reading, but you don't want to read it too fast because then it will be over.  The characters are really engaging and, although sometimes it's a little black and white as far as good/bad are concerned, there's a depth to the good/bad as well.  You find yourself thinking what you would do in the same situations and second-guessing some of the choices people make because it does involve you.<br /><br />I enjoyed these as much as I enjoyed Stephen King's books.  The best part is that there are more to come in the series. I've spent two days reading the sixth book (First Shift) and decided to write a review for Wool when I came on Amazon to buy the seventh book, Second Shift.  After I get that one, I'll go to Mr. Howey's website to see how he's coming along with the next installments.  By all means get this and enjoy the journey!  Mr. Howey, if you're still reading the reviews, you've got another fan and I'm telling everyone I know about your books, too!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|THIS A FANTASTIC THING AND DOUBLES AS STORAGE AS WELL AS AN PLAY ACCESSORY FOR HER BARBIE DOLLS!! IT IS SO LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY FOR HER TO HANDLE!
B00138CT16|5.0|It's the theme music from the movie, one of the more inspiring movies that I've seen in my life, and the music as well is quite inspiring.  I can say nothing more than that.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a good game to sit and pay when you have some free time.  I thoroughly enjoy playing it.
0061801313|5.0|My daughter got me hooked on Pretty Little Liars the show, so we decided to order the books.  Highly reccomend the set.  The books are much better and much less confusing than the TV series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was one of those who watched the movie before reading the book. I didn't see what all the hubbub was about, but thought the movie was good none the less. I was intrigued by the story line and wanted to read the book and I'm thoroughly happy I did. I was engrossed almost immediately and after the second chapter, I had a hard time putting it down. There were some chapters that seemed to drag on a little more than I wanted, but it wasn't too upsetting to give the book a less-than-five-star rating. The movie does no justice for the character Katniss. To understand who she really is and get a more indebted look at her personality, you must read the book. There is truly more to this story the book holds that the movie leaves out. A good read I have already recommended to some. I look forward to finishing out the series!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I have always enjoyed Jodi Picoult's books.<br />She has a way of quickly getting you interested in the story.<br />This one does just that! Have to admit that I couldn't put this down...had to give up<br />other things I needed to do to finish this in one sitting! Nice afternoon spent reading!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I think thia app is great i just wish i was able to get the freebie for my kindle fire hd 8&quot;
B00992CF6W|5.0|My children absolutely love this game!  I have to monitor how long they are playing it, because it is easy for them to get caught up in it!  I have not played it, but they show me the end result of what they have built and how you can walk through their building. It is really amazing the graphics used in this game!
B0066WJLU6|3.0|Have used it several time and all it does is light up the full screen. I cannot get the LED to work like a flashlight.
B007US9NA8|5.0|As a person who is fairly new to the bodybuilding game, I have found this work to be exhaustive!  It spans the entire gamut of bodybuilding.  Lots of history, science and good old &#34;tried & true&#34; wisdom on the subject, given by bodybuilding's most famous competitor.  Highly recommend!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|grandson plays this most of the time when he is using my Kindle. Ha has no problem moving around in the game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a person with incurable cancer, I was searching for something that would give me something to look forward to.  Dr Alexander,s personal and scientific treatment of the subject of Near Death Experience helped me to find some peace.
B009FZFONO|5.0|ONCE YOU START WATCHING YOU CANT STOP.  COULD ONLY STREAM WISH I COULD OF DOWNLOADED BECAUSE OF MY SLOW ISP
B004VMUS9G|2.0|Not loud enough even with volumn all the way up on Kindle Fire.  Most of the ring tones are - just that.  They are like cell phone ring tones.  My rating is: nothing special
0316228532|2.0|very dark reading... made me very sad. I knew going in that it was not a 'Potter' book, but I did NOT expect anything like this from her & I did not like it!
B0071DJZZA|3.0|Well of course there is little comparison between the two. Whilst the movie was OK the book is infinitely better.<br /><br />The author has expressed some bizarre and quirky events which I think will appeal to the younger generation, although I was intrigued by the story, the wonderfully colourful narration and glad when I got to the end.<br /><br />It certainly is worth reading...take it on holiday with you and you will taken with the characters to some place else!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I saw the last episode of season 2 & quickly became an ardant fan!  I spent the next four days 'catching up' with seasons 1 & 2.. I have now started season 3 and wish it was on daily!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|This is a book that will draw such diverse comments simply because it is different. Many of the descriptions are possibly alien to your,  or indeed my way of life and it may be confronting . But at the end of the day, embroiled in the midst of the story is some classy use of the English language, good use of vocabulary and lovely, lively expressions.<br /><br />Is it a classic? No probably not.<br /><br />Is it a good light hearted holiday read? That it is.<br /><br />Will it give you some new ideas to enhance your private life? Well i will leave that one to you.<br /><br />Is it pornographic? Absolutely not.<br /><br />Try it and you might enjoy it, if your psyche will let you read something that will possibly challenge your perceived morals!
0451232852|5.0|A great read - brings one right into the time period of the first world war and how all sides got involved. Suggest young readers could learn a lot of historical facts by reading this first of a 3 book triligy by Ken Follett
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Whist the nuances are similar to the previous two books this one is possibly what the traditional love honour and conquer, mills and boons stories might present. (I confess though that I have not read a M&B ever).<br /><br />This book has a bigger story, it twists and turns and still maintains some of the bedroom challenges and torn emotions of the previous two.<br /><br />Is it worth a read? That it is
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the charactors but lets face it...sometimes you get tired of ready about all the sex. Other than that it was good.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a great game with a good story. My only complaint is that it was shorter than most hidden object games.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Really grabs your attention. Hard to put down! Descriptions are wonderful it's like a movie playing in your mind. Can't wait to start the next book!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This was a great book, just as good as the first book in the series. The ending of her books always grabs you in to the next book, and you just want to keep reading, i love it!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Its a great trilogy and a great box set. What else do you need? Blu rays work well, decent menu options/animations, got a good deal.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|A wonderful, feel-good Family Movie about happier times in our Country.  Delightful Family situations, romance, lots of chuckles, and great music, songs (&#34;the Trolley Song, the Boy Next Door).  The 'Halloween' segment is a 'hoot'!<br />I LOVE young Margaret O'Brien!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Excellent , excellent, excellent....................they never let me down.  Their music touches my soul.  I love it so much.  Thank you
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very good writing.  Could not put it down.  Hoping for a sequel. I am anxious to read more of her books.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|my five year old and three year old love this game.  they love shooting. the cannon. I think it's. gregarious.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I adore this album.<br /><br />I first heard &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; online, and tracked down a few of Mackelmore's older albums and fell in love. He reminds me a lot of Flobots (other Macklemore listeners may want to give them a shot if they are looking for more in-depth listening).<br /><br />&#34;Can't Stop Us&#34;, &#34;White Walls&#34;, &#34;Gold&#34;, and &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; are probably my favorite tracks. The whole album just feels good and is put together incredibly well. Love it!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A Clash of Kings is the first fantasy novel in years and years to be legitimately called &#34;great.&#34; It will no doubt sweep away fans of this senses-reeling saga as effortlessly as its predecesor did, but with a story far more layered, suspenseful, shocking and exhilarating. That Martin can grip a reader so consistently and expertly throughout a story nearly a thousand pages long is no small achievement. Other genre luminaries as Jordan, Brooks, and Goodkind have garnered their followers and made their marks upon the genre for good or bad, but all of their works pale before A Song of Ice and Fire. There's no clash of kings to be had on this battlefield. Martin wins decisively, his genuine epic soaring above the countless wannabe epics weighing down bookstore shelves. And you know I'm not a guy given to hyperbole, if you've been reading this site for any length of time. (At least I think I'm not.)
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|It wasn't really funny like I thought it was supposed to be, but it was a decent story just not what I was expecting.
B0014C0BMU|5.0|I really like this trilogy and this movie was a great ending, I only wish there was more.  Neo sees the light!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It worked out well.  A gift for our son - he had had it on his list for some time.  Was happy to receive it.
B0026HKO2E|5.0|Neo comes of age! This movie s packed with a lot of action and heroism.  The story really takes hold and the plot thickens.  There is a lot going on so pay attention.
0345505387|1.0|I am still waiting to receive this book despite having ordered and paid for it well over a month ago. Where is it?!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|its awesome but I wish it had music so I don't have to those weird alarm clock tones but I just use those bells. I recommend this for u guys who like free stuff and everyone else.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Fabulous book by a fantastic writer. I couldn't put it down! This is one that I will definitely read again in the future.
B002EDH0FE|4.0|This is a pretty faithful adaptation to the comic book series that changed the way comics were written.  Dark, gritty, and well shot, this is a must for any superhero movie fan.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great book.  Extremely facinating to follow the families/characters during the WWI period.  Always something going on.<br />Very entertaining book and one difficult to put down.
B003UYV08E|2.0|Pretty much everyone else here has covered my principal gripes, so I'll just throw in a few observations here....<br /><br />1.  Story: Not Much.  Half this movie is Tony Stark moping around feeling sorry for himself, or engaging in an ego trip to mask the pain of what he thinks is imminent death.  Needless to say, none of this is entertaining, and for a guy who in the last film repeatedly put himself in harm's way to save total strangers, he sure doesn't seem to handle the idea of his own demise very well.  After a while, the audience stops feeling sorry for Tony and kind of wish he could go to his grave with a bit more dignity.<br /><br />2. Scarlett Johanssen looks good as usual, but I'm not as convinced as Hollywood seems to be that she can carry a scene with her body.  She's a walking cliche and CGI-rigged \\"stunts\\" don't help.  Naturally, she must be in a painted-on black suit which accentuates every curve.  She's a gorgeous woman, we get it.  Now please, give her a personality.<br /><br />3. Pepper Potts- well, Miss Paltrow looks pretty awful this time around- blotchy, and her nasty attitude toward her former boss is really over the top.  There's no chemistry between her and Downey, no matter how much they try to convince us that there is by using a heavy, blunt hammer.<br /><br />4. Samuel L Jackson- why even bother?  I can't believe he got a paycheck for this.  Boring, boring, boring.<br /><br />5. Villain- meh, best part of the film but nothing special either.<br /><br />Oh, and btw- in the first film, Cramer bought himself some product placement.  In the second, it was Bill O'Reilly.  Can I assume that Sean Hannity will be in the third film?  If so, could the director please make it long enough for me to use the rest room during that segment?
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've read all of the Harry Bosch novels, the latest one is the best. It was Michael Connelly at his very best.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to a great serious. Definitely my favorite trilogy I harvested read ! ! A must read for  everyone!
B00005NKKY|4.0|I admit that I find some of the songs on this CD to be my favorite S&G songs, such as \\"America,\\" \\"Old Friends,\\" and \\"Bookends Theme.\\"  But, there are also a couple of my least favorite S&D songs on here, \\"Mrs. Robinson,\\" and \\"Save the Life of my Child.\\"  So I give it a 4.  It is still a wonderfully done CD just as melodic and thoughtful as their other CD's, but just not one of my favorites.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This cover was purchased as a Christmas gift along with a Kindle Fire HD.  The cover fits well and looks beautiful.  :)
1419705849|5.0|This book was on both my 8 year old and 11 year old sons Christmas lists!  They both really enjoy this entire series, and loved this one just as much as the others.  My 11 year old said it was an easy read, and since he is starting to think girls are cool, he enjoyed the girlfriend angle.  In fact, he liked the book so much that he finished it in one day.  (And has recommended it to several friends at school, and to me--his mom.)  I think it is a great accomplishment when a writer can entertain a third grader as well as a sixth grader with the same story!  FIVE STAR rating from my son for content.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|Its a good app, the lay out is nice and its easy to navigate. It also seems well designed for tablet use, fast and responsive. Also it appears to be only a mildly intrusive app when comparing it to a lot of apps out there. Just make sure to read the guidlelines before running the app, if you dont agree with the parameters dont install, that pretty much goes for any app.
B003VAF7SQ|5.0|My son, 8 loves Kapla blocks. He loves them since he was.... 4 or 5? and he still enjoys them. (He also likes Lego) He had 200pc and this is just addition to that set. He also has a little booklet for the Kapla blocks which gives him some ideas what he can make. Very nice quality.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  I thought it would be funny and cute. I was at first then it just kinda turned into one of those erotic romance books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves the game and worked hard to get the app for his kindle. It was worth it. It's a great incentive for getting chores and homework done!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It's an amazing culmination of the saga ... thus far.  Really engrossing.  All of the myriad storylines begin to converge and form a compelling tapestry.  Loved it.
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|Purchased as a gift for a loved one. I was unsure the selection would meet what she was looking for. It covered what she wanted from the band.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|As good as the HBO television series was (and it was very, very good), the book which it is based on is better.  I'd start describing the immersive fictional world, the richness of the characters, the ... but I'll stop.  It is genuinely one of the most engaging fantasy books every written.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Hands down one of the best action movies of the year. Dont get me wrong, I still love the original, but this version has Stallone's version beat by a longshot. I don't understand why it didn't do so well at the box office, this movie kicks ass to the 100th power!!! If you love a good shoot em up, kick butt take names later type movie, then this is a must see.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|A lot of times the alarm on my old phone wouldn't go off if it was on silent, so I wouldn't get up when I needed! But with Alarm Clock Xtreme, I set it to go off any time and day I need it to, and I can select any ring tone from the music on my kindle fire... All in all, a great app!!
B003WMA7BU|3.0|Overall, there are many things to enjoy about this novel. From the sharp writing, to the engaging plot, and a slew of interesting characters. The protagonist, however, was just not redeemable to me. He seemed to have an insatiable bloodlust that I found to be off-putting. This should not be read as an indictment on the novel itself. I simply had a difficult time connecting with the main character. Most readers will feel differently since this has become a huge hit.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I never enjoy games like this before!Now I can't stop myself from.playing &middot; I hope you will try this game yourself&middot;
1451629184|5.0|A very sad story with a very happy ending. I detailed view into a sicko's mind straight from the source. She has done plenty of interviews and told her story but this book says so much more. Buy it!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|it is my love whenever I have to go to school I put an alarm in my fire and it wakes me up! I am in love with this alarm
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Got just what I wanted.  Put in the zip and get wherever in the world you might want to know about.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|I ordered this item for my grand-daughter's birthday.  She loves Legos, and she loves that they come in &#34;girlie&#34; colors.  She loves building things.  Maybe she will be an architect...you never know.  The shipping was quick also.  It was a very easy transaction.  Thank you!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|It is not what I expected.  I wanted to be able to just write in, as I have done on my laptop and get my answers choices.  This has categories and I cannot figure it out.  Probably me, but to me it does not get what I want.  Just simple write in question and get answer options.
B0094GW6YE|5.0|For long-time KISS fans and for those just getting into the band today, Monster is quite a treat.  No, it doesn't sound like Destroyer or Rock And Roll Over, but unlike Sonic Boom, it wasn't meant to.  One of the things I like best about Monster is that it doesn't try to sound like a cross between some of their past albums.  It feels like they recorded an album that they would made if Paul, Gene, Tommy & Eric were making their first album together as a band.  Of course it still sounds like a KISS album, but not necessarily like any other in their catalog.<br /><br />When comparing Monster to Sonic Boom, it's a big leap forward in terms of playing, songwriting, guitar solos, production, etc..  Sonic Boom was a really solid album and the band deserves an 'E' for effort for it, but Monster is just better from front to back.  Plus, it rocks a bit harder as well.<br /><br />I never review music right after I buy it because it takes a while to properly digest a new album.  Now that I've owned Monster for three months, I can honestly say that I like Monster even more today than I did the day I first unwrapped the CD.  If you are a KISS fan who only likes their 70s music, this one probably isn't for you, but I really think that those who enjoy the entire catalog of KISS music will not be let down by Monster.<br /><br />Album Highlights: \\"Wall of Sound\\", \\"Back To The Stone Age\\", \\"Shout Mercy\\", \\"Long Way Down\\" and \\"Outta This World\\"
B00479SVBU|5.0|I ordered this item after buying and returning a cheap version from Walmart that absolutely sucked!  I didn't have high expectations about the sound quality or clarity after the Walmart version.<br />I was surprised and amazed at how clear and well made this player is and how easy it is to use it.<br />I was also very pleased that the SD card fits completely inside the player.<br />I also love the scrolling file display for long song titles.<br />My car's power outlet has constant power so having the ability to power the unit off without having to take it out of the socket is fantastic.<br />I HIGHLY recommend this model over anything else found on the internet.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|I'll admit that I didn't finish the book, so maybe there were some nuggets of wisdom, hilarious anecdotes, insightful observations, or the like in later sections of the book. Her style of writing is okay -- some of her anecdotes were funny and well-told -- but I'm not getting the \\"wit\\" or \\"provocativeness\\" that the book description states.  I've read better books in this style that had more interesting things to say, so I returned this one after paging forward quite a bit hoping for more.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|The book begins with a methodical description of  lives of the main characters.  The slow pace of the story development quickly vanishes as espionage and intrigue emerge  to present a very compelling and fascinating story.
1852862912|4.0|Fascinating and intelligent book. In addition the art is detailed and very well done. If you've seen the movie and liked it you will really enjoy this book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|every one in my house loves this app. My 18 month old, my 6 year old, even grandma. This app is free and has tons of versions of angry birds.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was  a suspense book that just kept changing and unraveling. So in tune to many modern day stories you see on the news about wives missing and presumed dead.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I find the game very challenging and entertaining. I keeps you trying different optionions when you fail a level. Each effort gives you and idea of how to beat the level
B008N1V11U|5.0|epicly awsum tam although it takes forever to download the MGB it is without a downtown one of gamelofts best games evur!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I have ever read! It had everything, romance, suspense, and it had me not putting the book down till the end! Don't let the high school romance categorize this in a teen book, it is very well one hell of a book that everyone should read!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good read. Has a cliffhanger for the ending. Now have to finish the series. Definitely going to read this series.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|I watched this movie with my wife because she had heard good things about it and she loves to watch anything with singing(huge Glee fan). I went into it thinking that it probably wouldn't be too bad, but it was actually really funny!<br />In the very first scene, I thought to myself \\"Holy crap, it's Adam from Workaholics! This movie is gonna be good!\\" And it was good.<br />Rebel Wilson is hilarious. And of course, so is the guy from Workaholics.<br />If I had to compare it to another movie, I would compare it to Bring It On, which is another movie I was surprised that I liked.<br />Also, a coworker of mine said that there are a lot of funny outtakes on the internet. Not sure if they are included in the DVD, but its worth checking out.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|JUST LIKE MY COMPUTER..EASY TO USE...GOOD TO HAVE SEARCH ON YOUR KINDLE....GIVE IT A TRY AND YOU'LL LOVE IT..GOTTA HAVE GOOGLE
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Its the best Dredd adaptation yet and Karl Urban is a great Judge!  Now I'm sad I didn't see it on the big screen.  Great acting, story and special effects.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I had gone so long without a good photo software ... this app was so thrilling. I really enjoyed it and it ran so smoothly. Super user friendly which is a must ...that's my highest praise.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want this game but it's tok expensive. I downloaded an older version from a website but I know it's not the same experience as having the full version. PLEASE MAKE THIS A FREE APP OF THE DAY SO I CAN GET IT!!! It would awesome if it was a free app of the day.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Ok so you really want to read this book, since you've obviously read the first one, but the author; in my opinion, seems to be holding herself back.... like if she didn't want to reveal any more details of this amazing story---deliberately on purpose-- until book number 3. It's like while she was writing number 2 had already decided of making this story a trilogy and you just sort of sense this since as you read, seems the story suddenly seems a bit too slow or even monotonous and ordinary.<br />Fortunately by the end, once again, you find yourself opening book number 3 as soon as you finish book number 2
1582701709|5.0|I bought two of these as had been borrowing my mother's and she wanted hers back! I gave one to a very close friend as a gift and can honestly say the books have changed our lives. They are surprisingly insightful and when you start reading you sit there nodding to yourself and finish feeling inspired and wondering why you hadn't read or heard of the book before.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Every question finally got answered and everything falls into place. Realistically and with consequences .<br />I think the ending is exactly what it should have been.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game! I don't think I am playing it strategically but still enjoy passing the time with this game.
1932100660|5.0|This book is easy to ready and understand. If you want to make a serious change in your life about diet and weight control,  Read this book
0780631684|4.0|This dvd is for people who like to watch something exciting. Although, i still think final destination 5 was the best.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was a very good book. It was not quite as engaging as the first two, but was still great to read and did a nice job of wrapping up the story and series.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|This dvd is amazing. the special effects can`t be described. Makes you feel like you are right there. Great dvd
B00003CXAA|3.0|This item came in really poor packaging. I thought the discs may have been damaged considering the box was completely demolished. The plastic wrap around it was extremely loose and looked like it had been through the worst!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could barely stop reading it. I can't wait to read the third one. Also can't wait for the movie.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|great game to play i got to level 95 still trying to get out of that level it challenges you more when you get up to higher levels
B005DR64OQ|1.0|WTF? This was so bad it hurt to watch. Nicolas hasn't made a good movie in ages so I sort of knew what I was walking into. Nicole is normally great and makes interesting, memorable movies. This one will only be remembered as a bad nightmare. Unless you're into torture and weak plots do yourself a big favor and stay away from this. Rent Panic Room instead. You'll be much happier.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Cant get enough of the show or these books. Read them all last summer, hard to put down. Now how long do I have to wait for book six!!?
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the last we will hear of Larrson's Lisbeth Solander and while it is not as good as the first it still stands head and shoulders above others of its like. Maybe I should tone that down a bit since I have not read in this vein for some years since I read things like Bourne Identity and the Manchurian Candidate ( a span of many years).<br /><br />I have reviewed the two previous books of this trilogy and ask that you look at The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.
B00321SMFO|1.0|I was very excited to watch this HD series but unfortunately the audio was incredibly poor.  The audio was phasing in and out making it unwatchable.  I tried watching for 15 minutes but had to give up.  I contacted amazon customer service and they refunded my digital purchase.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I bought &#34;...Dragon Tatoo&#34; a couple of days after my daughter surprised me with a Kindle Fire HD at Christmas (012) and I had seen the Swedish flics as well as the American effort. The whole series is so good I read them one, two, three. finishing the last &#34;...Hornet's Nest.&#34; and found myself mourning Steig's demise in a selfish way See I suspect that Lisbeth's sister was perfect as a mechanism to let her keep goin'.
034580404X|5.0|Got this series as a lightening deal. Best price for the best books. I highly recommend the series to anyone I know.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Good Book, Great original Character(s) the greatest of which is:<br /><br /> Lisbeth is a true creation among characters, a character who will stay with you; a character that compelled me to reread all three books, buy the extended version of the Bluray trilogy and still periodically pick it off my Netflix Streaming que.<br /><br /> I know I have some eccentricities in my tastes but they do not include propensities to join fanclubs--never understood people who loved the Beatles, or Star Wars, or Star Trek as a \\"fan\\"--passionate and a whiff or a stink of obsession--even as I enjoyed all these a lot.<br /><br /> I recently discovered that my older brother had read these books twice in a few months and he is very different than me in his tasts and habits--he reads more than I do in his later years.<br /><br /> This review contains little talk of authorship, writing style, plot progress or themes on purpose, start with the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and if it is not for you dont bother with the rest--this one stands on its own pretty well, and the other two are best if you read the previous.<br /><br /> I feel like the kids I ran into in the earlier days when a 12 year old approached me in book store and earnestly charge me with the task of reading the Harry Potter books, because they are so good.<br /><br />I charge you with the task of reading these books.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|(written by Michael's wife) I got this CD after watching the movie in theaters.  I just couldn't wait for the DVD to come out.  I was pleased with the entire CD but wished they would have included all of the songs from the movie (missing are Titanium - Beca sings this in the shower - and Regional finals).  I was pleased that the CD included the Riff Off.  It is a studio version, however, so it is more put together and actually sounds better than the movie.<br /><br />If you're into the movie or enjoy a capella singing, I would HIGHLY recommend this album.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The feel is great. It stopped giving me a winning deal though. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to play solitaire.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Normally, I am not a big fan of nature programs; however, this is exceptional. The cinematography is simply stunning. It helps me realize that he world is truly a remarkable and beautiful place.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I prefer the Pinterest app over the website! Never have any issues and love how easily I can switch between screens.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This Anker Gaming Mouse is simply the best that I have ever owned!  You can customize all of the buttons, easily change the mouse speed and DPI, select diffierent profiles, change the Anker symbol color and much, much more!  It fits comfortable in my hand and because it's a laser mouse, you can use in practically any surface.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a realiable gaming mouse, this is the one for you.  Low price point, 9 customizable buttons, and one stylish mouse... all ready for all of your gaming needs!  I highly recommend this mouse to any serious gamer out there!
B009CPEOC4|4.0|I thought it would be more like a movie than a documentary, i still liked it and my 13yr old loved it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love the Bosch mysteries.  Michael Connelly is at his best with these.  The Black Box  had lots of twists and turns and kept the reader interested.
B008QYT7DI|4.0|This was an interesting read, something about it sticks within your heart as if an imprint were left there...even if things turned out differently than you'd planned , a sort of tranquillity and tenderness remains in your heart.
014241543X|5.0|If I Stay left me reeling with a book high however, with as good as it was it made me cry throughout the whole thing. I had no idea that this book was going to be so emotional but it was a good emotional. The story is very well done and I can honestly say that I have not ever read a story similar to it. Mia is a fantastic character and has a heartbreaking decision to make. I'm not sure I would have made the same decision she did if I was in her situation.<br />Mia is having flashes of memories from her life since she is now in a coma. Without giving much away, she is in an accident and has to decide whether she even wants to live or if she wants to just slip away and die. The characters were all fantastic, I loved her family as much as she did I think.<br /><br />Adam, her boyfriend, is heartbreaking as well as her best friend, Kim Schein. They do some crazy things to get into the ICU where some of it you just have to laugh.<br /><br />Even though this book made me cry from almost the beginning to the end, this is a fabulous story and very well done. I loved it more than I thought I would. Read it!
1451627289|5.0|A little slow initially then you Just can't put it down I spent So many nights reading till the wee hours of the morning unable to put the book down as it was so exciting well worth the read!!!! Buy it !! I even gave it to my dad for an Xmas present because he would enjoy reliving that era again!!!!
0142420891|5.0|This is the second book to If I Stay by Gayle Forman and it was just as fantastic as the first. This time the story is told through Adam's point of view and it is three years later, Mia and Adam are not together any longer which kind of made me sad to see that in the beginning. I mean, they went through so much in the first book and to not be together? I guess it just goes to show you that death and almost dying doesn't make a romance strong.<br /><br />You get to see all the struggles that Adam is dealing with and the new fame that him and the band now have. He also has a famous girlfriend now that he isn't really happy with but they rarely see each other. He is having an interview done and the reporter starts trying to dig up the story between him and Mia which he has buried quite well in that no one knows they were ever together during high school. She's famous too now, well more up and coming in the classical world.<br /><br />The night after the interview Adam decides to go for a walk and passes a theatre which Mia is playing at. Leaving it up to fate, he goes to see if there is a ticket available and of course, there is. They then meet up afterwards and start a whole night of being together but only as friends. She is showing him around New York and he is reminiscing about what happened before they broke up and how it happened.<br /><br />You just feel sad for the both of them because they so obviously love each other and yes, I did cry during some parts of this book as well. Hey, I'm a sucker for a good story and these books are really well written.<br />I loved the ending and kind of hope there's another one although I'm not sure what more could be done.
0765325950|1.0|If i had not invested time into reading the previous 13 books I would not have purchased it. I will probably shy away from Tor products in the future.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless by Colleen Hoover was amazing. I didn't even know what this book was really about when I first saw it, I was just drawn to Colleen Hoover as I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat.  I was instantly sucked into the story of Sky and Dean Holder and I knew this was a book I was going to love. Colleen Hoover hit a home run, yet again!<br />Sky isn't really like the typical 17 year old because she's been homeschooled her whole life, her mom hates modern technology so she doesn't have a television, cell phone, or even the internet. However, she is best friends with her neighbour who is a bit of a slut but an awesome one (if there is one) so Sky has kind of gotten a name for herself basically by association. For her senior year, she decides that she wants to go to public school, which her mother allows. The girls try to tease her but Sky is hilarious in how she handles it and I love her. I wish I could be as confident and not caring about what people think as she is!<br />Dean Holder has been away from school for about a year and not even sure he wants to go back. However, Sky and Holder hit it off after a chance meeting in the supermarket where he thinks she is someone else as well as on her run Sky ends up panting at the mailbox of Holder's (unaware naturally). It's fate guys. So, Holder ends up going back to school because of something that Sky says to them and they are hanging out at school. Breckin (Sky's new bestest friend in the whole wide world) was a hilarious guy as well. I loved him a lot.<br />I'm all over the place with this, aren't I? Anyway, there are a lot of twists and turns in this book and I'm not going to give them away because I didn't see any of it coming, at all. I would like you guys to not see it coming either so don't read any spoiler reviews. Promise me! Sky's dad...wow. Sky's mom...insane. INSANE but at the same time completely awesome.<br />I loved the story because I found it to be fresh and not the same old bad boy meets good girl drama at all. Sky's whole life is one big mind screw for lack of a better term.<br />Read this, I know you'll love it as much as I did, then come back here and tell me what you think about what happened.<br />\\"The sky is always beautiful.Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy,it's still beautiful to look at....it'll be there no matter what...and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"a at all. Sky's whole life is one big mind screw for lack of a better term.<br />Read this, I know you'll love it as much as I did, then come back here and tell me what you think about what happened.<br />\\"The sky is always beautiful.Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy,it's still beautiful to look at....it'll be there no matter what...and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|New favorite book and I'm almost in tears because it's over!!! I don't usually rate books but I had to with this one. Bravo to Colleen-- you are an extremely talented writer.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|We saw this in the theatre with our kids and we all loved it.  A great story for kids with some deep environmental themes.  Very appropriate for toddlers with very little offensive language (I think The Onceler says idiot and stupid a couple of times).  We love the versatility of this with the DVD for the car, the Blu-ray for home and the digital copy for the tablets.  Gotta see it!
B008SVFX96|5.0|what's not to like about richie sambora waiting for any new records from him will be happy to buy them
B00APUQT7I|4.0|This movie is a good family movie. Our 10 year old loved it. It also made my wife and I laugh.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|While I was browsing Amazon I was surprised to discover Hopeless and was taken aback by its success. This book came out on the 17th of December 2012. 3 weeks later it had 1700 reviews 1480 5 star reviews on Amazon.com and has become the number 1 bestseller in the kindle shop. I was amazed because it Mrs. Hoover's 3rd book, it was only published as e-book and I am not aware of a lot of publicity around this book. I have the impression that people simply liked it and recommended it, enjoyed a fast and intense read. I recommended it, told my mom the story, enjoyed it immensely... and I hope you will too.<br /><br />Sky is a 17year old adopted girl, having lived with her \\"mom\\" for the last 13 years in protective world, homeschooled, without internet, TV or telephone. Her neighbor is her best friend and together they managed to convince Karen, Sky's mother to let her go to public school for the last year of high school. Six however is spending 6 month in Europe, so she will not be able to help Sky, but she will not be alone... She meets Breckin and Holder (sight).<br /><br />The first half of the book is a love story, not the most romantic, nor the most traditional but very sweet and sometimes strange and troubling; the second part is a roller coaster of events and feelings. Sometimes I was surprised, sometimes I thought I knew what Sky and Holder would discovered, but feared to be right in the same time.<br /><br />The Cover is great. The explanation of the title as fantastic. The characters are ... amazing, they are alive, real, fun, deep, and tender; I want them as real friends and I hope that these kind of strong and understanding people really exist. Written from Sky's POV it becomes very intense.<br />I laughed, smiled, was sad and shocked. Sometimes I put the book down having to breath to let go of the story in order to be able to get back in. As sky says I needed a \\"chapter break\\"<br />I really enjoyed Mrs. Hoover's writing; she used powerful words and sentences.There were no lengths or awkward moments because everything becomes clear towards the end.<br /><br />I loved the book, enjoyed it fully, recommended it and I am really expecting any other book of this author to be as good.

B00005AWMF|5.0|Cd plays great music is good artist is amazing received the item for the shipper in a time manner with no problems.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|The movie was better than I expected it to be considering that it is not based on a specific book by Robert Ludlum. The action sequences were very good. I do think the movie ended with out much of a resolution, they could have wrapped things up better and still left room for the next sequel

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such an amazing book couldn't put it down ever!! So compelling and a good story line about two people dealing with so many struggles who still fall in love.
B004SDEP38|4.0|I got this when it was the fee app of the day. It's a great little app that can be used to display and edit word, excel, and powerpoint files. It does the trick for on the fly edits.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|This product came as described and worked perfectly. I consider all factors when ordering, including quality, price and company reputation. This product passed all. I can recommend this to others.<br />Haven't used it that much.

B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Dont get me wrong i like the album because of the songs lies greed misery. victimized. lost in the echo. and burn it down. But it didnt have that hard core feel that rage and anger being let out. like the album hybrid theory Personely i could relate to the songs one step closer and run away them helped with the anger and stress i had. But chester still has that hard core voice that i love and mike still has that raping thats meaning full i hope the next album is more hard core. Also got a lp tattoo to show my love chester. Thanks
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|This product came as described and worked perfectly. I consider all factors when ordering, including quality, price and company reputation. This product passed all. I can recommend this to others.<br />I am the real Jason Borne,but you must keep that to yourself. Seriously this is classified.<br />I just wanted to see how my day job looks on film. Not bad But come on, who can replace Jason. His character had more heart and spirit. Which is sometimes all that gets us through the mission. I am by no means the biggest or strongest guy around but I have what it takes heart and spirit of not quitting no matter what. I hope Matt returns for the roll he was made to play, he already stated publicly that he would if asked.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I Loved this series so much. It is an amazing book filled with action drama and suspense. Throughout the book you also feel extremely close to the main character( Thomas) and you suffer as he suffers. I encourage all to read this book and share the same experience I have.
B002ELM5HY|3.0|Nothing new here...move along. Lots of that same Irish-sounding stuff. I just keep wishing Mark will record an album of great guitar work and vocals along the lines of Sailing to Philadelphia. Not here, but MK at his most mediocre is still better than many others.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Hard to catch on initially, but then soared through an intriging story of survival with one of mother nautres more feared wild animals on a life boat/raft in the middle of the ocean.  One can only imagine the emotional and physical endurance he encountered throughout the 277 days a float.  Want to see the movie!
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|This movie was made for those who didn't feel they had time to read the book. Yea it's Ok but it is just like any other movie based on a book. It only shows what it can but not the whole meaning. The book came into my vlife about 15 years ago. After I read it my life changed. It is a spiritual awareness book ( NOT RELIGIOUS) that is hidden is amungst the car chases and bullet dodging. In the thrill of the excitement you accidently stumble into self awareness.<br /> A must read for everyone breathing.<br /> Then watch the move.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Needs lots of improvements for the Kindle Fire HD.<br />Not a very easy app to understand.<br />Wouldn't really recommend this.
B000E5KJD4|1.0|I live the &#34;Phantom of the opera&#34; so I ordered the DVD. Well the 1st thing I noticed was it was in a different type of packaging . Blue Ray DVD's come in a Blue package. Regular DVD's come in clear or white. case. But this one is in a &#34;Red&#34; case. It would not play in my VCR or even my computer ( That can play anything ). I contacted the seller and their reply was &#34; Oh yea it is in a different format sorry&#34; Well?????? What are you going to do about it?? Yea Yea I only spent like 5 dollars on it but still if they did this to over 100 people then they got $500. for worthless DVD'S.<br />Don't give them a dime more.!!!!!!!
B008I43DYU|4.0|I chose this rating because its a very easy app to use<br />Really have no dislikes<br />I would recommend this to everyone.
0547848412|4.0|I read this book several years ago and then recently reread it to freshen it in my mind before seeing the movie.<br /><br />I should probably point out that this book, more than any other I've read in recent years, has stayed with me.  I find myself thinking about it or remembering parts of it or ruminating on the themes in it quite often.  It is visually stunning, if such a things can be said about a book.<br /><br />And like that thought, I think the book is made of up opposites:  rational (one version of the story) and irrational (Pi's name), dense (themes and information) and sparse (the other version of the story), being with God and being utterly alone, feeling at one with the ultimate and feeling lonely.  The whole book seems to operate on opposite ends of the spectrum in virtually every sense of those words.<br /><br />I am not smart enough to grasp everything that this book has to say (thankfully my copy was a reader's copy with questions for book clubs right in the back so I could use them to help me understand what I had not picked up on while reading it myself) but it seems to me to be one of those books that poses so many questions to the reader and demands so much from you both in visualization and understanding that it may just be too much for many of us to take in completely in just one reading.  Perhaps it's one of those books to be reread every two or three years (maybe ending just before Christmas?) so that you can come to it a slightly different person with better understanding each time.<br /><br />I will say that I had completely forgotten the dry factual story after the first reading and was surprised by it again when I finished the book the second time.  It struck me just as hard the second time around -- maybe more so.<br /><br />If the true test of a book is that you don't want it to end or that you want to crawl inside the book and live, then this fails (for me anyway).  But if it is that you find yourself thinking about it long after youread it and the story is so visually clear and descriptive that you can see everything as if you were actually watching the movie and every time you read it, you realize something new that you hadn't before and come away a slightly better person for having read it and thought about what it had to say and applied various bits of it to your life, than this is a good book.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I'm loving this app so far!  Don't change a thing. Well, maybe lower some of the prices to clear trees, but aside from that, it's great.
B000W93CHC|5.0|EASIER TO FOLLOW THAN HIS FIRST BOOK--KEEPS YOUR FOCUS FROM THE BEGINNING--aCTION PACKED!  SUPERB BOOK FOR THE KINDLE (OTHERWISE, ITS A VERY HEAVY BOOK!)
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I love Angry Birds.  It is so easy to get lost in the game and before you know it you've been sitting there longer than you meant to.  I do, however, miss the helps that you can get when you play on facebook.
B009HELT3C|2.0|The quality of the video was not good.<br />Perhaps need to have the regular version and not HD in the future.
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|Read this for my bookclub - really enjoyed the book. Thought provoking but easy to read. Read it in a day.
B002VECM72|5.0|I just love this movie.  The story is great, Sandra Bullock and other cast are just great.  I like a movie that leaves me feeling good at the end.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think that I would give it a 4 star because It wasn't  really that long and entertaining but I really did like it :) but it wasn't  a  good as the other books
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case works just great with my kindle.  No problems at all.  I love the purple color.  It arrived in good condition.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I was  browsing through a list of recommendations to see what book to read next, and I couldn't help but let this book catch my eye. I've read other books by John Green, and they all were very good and had a firm grip on my attention, but I felt as if I finished this book for the sake of finishing it... Not to say it was  a bad book, because it wasn't, but everything just seemed too unrealistic and at times it jus dragged on. A mediocre book at best; I just hope John Green's next book does the justice of his previous ones.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book started out slow for me but after a few chapters I was hooked. I looked forward to coming home from work so that I could read it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This is the first time I've ever written a review about anything, but after the horrible experience I've had with this case, I'm hoping to save a few other people some frustration.  I had trouble right away with this case.  First, the screen portion had air bubbles in it and was wavy, making it hard to use the touch screen on the phone.  Then, when it got so bad that I couldn't press the END button to end a call, I decided to contact the company. After waiting on hold for about twenty minutes, the CSR informed me that it was a counterfeit case.  So, since this was given to me as a Christmas gift, I'm not the only victim... my mother in law, who gave it to me, is out the money she paid for it.  I am beyond aggrivated at this point.  Please, DO NOT buy this case.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|I love Sting and this was a very nice verison of his music.<br />Very different from the norm. But I like it
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I just got back home from watching the movie, and have to say that I loved it. Both characters have major flaws, and both characters managed to achieve something great in spite of that. A happy ending with bruises.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is my second kindle. I have this app on both. I like the option to have voice notification, it's great at getting my kids to plug it when it gets low.
B00886184A|5.0|First, let me say I am a true Gentle Giant fan ... I have all their albums from the first through Civilian and other compilations, live audio, DVDs etc ... plus I've grabbed any respectable remasters along the way to update my collection ... so when it comes to this \\"2nd half\\" of the GG catalog, I need no convincing; I'm already in ... moving on, this set gets maximum stars ...<br /><br />Here are my reasons for the rating and positive recommendation:<br /><br />1)  THE REMASTERING ... in my opinion, the remastering here is superb ... overall, it is, w/o question, better to my ears than the 35th Anniversary editions ... if I had to use one word to describe what I think is better, it would be \\"clarity\\" ... the remastering here has sparkle and life ... I hear subtle things that are not as apparent in the original CDs or the 35th Anniv editions ... excellent job of remastering ... well worth replacing older editions with these tracks if you are already a fan ... well worth considering this set rather than any other editions if you are missing a complete latter half of GG's catalog ... my conclusions have come from A/B'ing the 35th editions with the tracks on this set ... (one reviewer's take was that the 35th Anniv edition of Free Hand is a little better (less compressed) than the tracks here ... I can hear his point, but again, there is a clarity that I prefer ... either way, I don't think one would be disappointed with the Free Hand tracks on this set ...<br /><br />2)  THE VALUE ... for the money, this set includes 6 GG titles plus 8 bonus tracks ... try getting all that from individual CDs and you begin to realize the bargain<br /><br />3)  THE BONUS TRACKS ... these are not just filler ... there is 1 \\"new\\" instrumental track, 4 alternate studio versions of great tracks from Free Hand (these are informative ... GG used some of the ideas from these sessions for their live arrangements) ... then 3 tracks that are substantially single mixes of tracks from a couple of the later albums .. those 3 are fun but not as essential in my opinion<br /><br />4)  THE FIRST TIME REMASTERING OF CIVILIAN ... since it has been continually passed over for this treatment, even with the 35th Anniv Editions, this set is almost worth the price of admission for that alone ... Civilian is not favored by all GG fans but I happen to like it considering the times, musical landscape and the bands' status during it's recording ...<br /><br />5)  The Packaging is simple but does include a good write up of the history of the band during the Chrysalis years ... I personally think it is about right for this set ... I don't particularly like volumes of write ups or pictures but do appreciate some history and insights ...<br /><br />6)  Renewed appreciation ... this set has given me, an old fan, a much better appreciation of the music in GG's latter half discography ... it hasn't the complexity of their first half, but still the playing is tops and the creativity is ever present and unmistakable ... I am enjoying this music with renewed interest and understanding thanks to the nice remastering here ...<br /><br />There is only one minor \\"con\\" with this set that has already been observed:<br /><br />- leaving off \\"Heroes No More\\", a bonus track that has been included with each release of Civilian since about 1994 ... however, given the fact it was not on the original release, this can be forgiven ... it would have been better to include it even if it meant leaving off one of the single edit tracks but that is my opinion and I certainly think this is a very minor negative<br /><br />In summary, no doubts for me that this is an essential acquisition for Gentle Giant Fans and a great value for anyone wanting to explore the latter half of this great band's history ...the later albums .. those 3 are fun but not as essential in my opinion<br /><br />4)  THE FIRST TIME REMASTERING OF CIVILIAN ... since it has been continually passed over for this treatment, even with the 35th Anniv Editions, this set is almost worth the price of admission for that alone ...

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This season's storyline is based on the book Clash of Kings by George R.R. Martin. There are two things that are obviously different. In the book, Robb's wife is Jeyne, an innocent girl he marries because they have premarital sex. On the show, his wife's name is Talisa and they meet because she's a nurse who is also a Lannister spy. The other thing that's different is that in the book, when Bran goes north he takes with him Hodor and two children-guides, Meera and Jojen Reed. Osha takes Rickon to White Harbor. On the show, Bran, Hodor, Osha, and Rickon stay together, at least for the final episode of season two. Do the changes bother me as a viewer of the show? No, I had no issues. It's more interesting that Robb falls for a spy. Did the changes bother me as a reader of the books? Of course, but I keep in mind that the book series and the show are two different entities. As tv, GoT is still one of my favorite series. Yes, season 2 was different, and I am fine with that and looking forward to season 3 in March
B00APUQH0W|4.0|A cute, albeit predictable, story about a grumpy old father and his grown daughter who is resentful for being neglected when she was younger, and how they rebuild their relationship.<br /><br />The HD digital rental from Amazon was good quality and streamed to my Roku without any problems what so ever. While I prefer the superior audio and video quality of Blu-ray discs, Amazon's video quality is good enough that I'll rent downloads again in the future.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I had found this book at a local book store and almost bought it when I realized I could instead purchase it on my.kindle :) I'm so glad I got it. The plot is well written, the characters are beautifully written, I couldn't put it down! I will be reading this book a few thousand times more before I get tired of it :)
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was Ssuch a great read.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  Our entire book club loved it.  l
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Very good everyday reading. It caught my attention since the first lines of the book, the story is very feasible and well connected.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Suspenseful, violent, and funny. An ingenious plot, outstanding dialog -- this is where Tarantino shines -- and, Brad Pitt's hamming aside, very good performances. Worthy of special note is the gifted Christophe Waltz as Colonel Landa. In my view, he steals the movie, just as he does in Django, Unchained, also by Tarantino. This Austrian actor has been seen very little this side of the Atlantic (Richelieu in The Three Musketeers, one of the fathers in Carnage). This ought to change.
034580404X|5.0|The first book was really good, I didn't want to put it down.  Must reads for women 25 and older!!  I am now reading the 2nd book and so far it is just as great as the first can't wait to find out what happens next!
0761536434|5.0|Used as a gift for my son who is a heavy gamer. He loved it because it had so much information on the development of the games.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read! The book is very intense and will keep you reading! Love it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great mind puzzle game with simple rules of play but very satisfying.  A deceptively simple game thatand a great challenge.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|The story itself is kinda crapy. Its more like a add on the the last one. However I am a resident evil fan and as such I had fun watching it. Just let it be entertainment and turn off your brain while watching. The sole reason I gave it four stars is the presence of Ada Wong.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|My son has everything so he usually ask for movies or games for Christmas....He particularly asked for this movie and has enjoyed it tremendously.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not what I thought this book would be, but still a great story that has you not wanting to stop until the last chapter!
B0095G5AFU|4.0|I would give this five stars if you can tell me why it is that when I save the books as pdf and I go to the location that they are supposed to be at there is nothing there. The rain I'm adding is because it saves the files to the phone but I want to save them to my SD card as well.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game with good hints.  Only thing to make it better would be if you could go to the map and jump to other locations without having to back track your path.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is the game I play twenty four seven it is the best game ever it is awesome if u r thinking about downloading it than think faster download it and if u do not download it than u r in<br />trouble by me!!!!!!! Think think think think!!!!thank u!!!!!!!!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game was great!Hints available when you need it and good ending to the storyline. I highly recommend it to those who enjoy hidden object games.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I loved this book. It was very moving .I recommend this book to everyone who thinks everyone even animals have an opinion on things .
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Maybe the book is always better than the film but in this case the TV series comes out with credit. Anyone who likes the TV series would love the book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the characters, loved the twists.  It had me from the very start.  I'm looking forward to more from this author.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|That was an awesome book I love romance and comedy and books every thing was lovely and sweet thank you
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|This was a terrible movie that went nowhere fast.The only thing lawless was the fact that people paid good money to see it.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|I don't think Ken Follett managed to make enough capital of the time period covered by this link in the trilogy. Had he also managed to capture the War from the perspective of other nationalities who were involved, this would have been far more powerful.  For me the storyline seemed much thinner than the previous book.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I used this as it's easier to use than the &#34;web&#34; area, but isn't as easy to manage as the Google search page on my PC.  But it works.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I can't find what it can do. Refer to Chess! I need clear directions to make it work like I want it to.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|I downloaded this for my grandkids, but I find it enjoyable to play as well when I have some down time and am just looking for something fun to do with my Kindle.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|Chess-It beats me 90% of the time and it's set on the moron level. But, it's still a lot of fun.
B0001I562I|5.0|I was so excited to find this movie, one of my child hood favorites, it got to me fast and with no damage :)
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's sharp, clear and easy to use. I like to check the weather in several places at one sitting and this is not a problem.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addicting game. Coins generate kind of slowly but it just builds the anticipation! I would definitely recommend this game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I cried so many times  and the  end touched my heart and this series will always be with me<br />I loved it
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The whole family loves this movie, despite the whole magic part of it, that can get a little scary for the littles.  It is a great movie that has a beautiful redemptive way of restoring relationship (a first for Disney) between mother and daughter.
B009DT98RK|5.0|I Saw the show live in Austin, texas - the DVD captured the vibe of the moment, great backing band.
0988262592|5.0|I was lucky enough to receive an early copy of \\"The Phoenix Project\\" from Gene.<br /><br />Initially I was surprised to find myself reading about DevOps and IT systems management in novel format. By the end of the book the genius of using story telling and \\"specification by example\\" had hit me.<br /><br />What Gene, Kevin and George have achieved here is significant. They are educating readers on a huge range of complex topics - IT Service Management, Lean, Systems Thinking, Business and IT Operations, Agile, The Toyota Way - and have done so by providing a real world example in a fictional novel.<br /><br />But, of course none of this is fiction. If you work in IT Operations, Development or as a business leader you will immediately identify with one of the main characters in this book. Are you a Bill or a Steve. Possibly you are a Brent.<br /><br />You will then read about these characters facing the same struggles that you do with your organisation. IT is too slow, IT is impacting the business, Developers don't care about operational issues. Business leaders want change and feel held to ransom.<br /><br />I honestly believe that this novel will be a turning point for anyone that picks it up. We will probably look back in years to come and point to this novel where thousands of people \\"got it\\" and started to turn their IT organisations into something very different.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I think it is a very well polished period piece with excellent acting and accurate depiction of the 1960-70's.  overall I would rate this excellent.
B0002W19KQ|1.0|Unfortunately I have been spoilt by seeing the four part miniseries french with english subtitles of Les Miserables and that is what I thought I was ordering. Instead I received  a shortened film version. The miniseries was fantastic and gave far more depth to the characters and understanding of the relationships between the characters. I was very disappointed to have received the same film that I had already bought previously especially with shipping And handling costs as well! If anyone can shed some light on how I can purchase the four part miniseries I would be very grateful.
B000IDGDPA|3.0|The story was interesting, but again, Helen Hunt seemed miscast as the femme fetale'...on the other hand I felt S. Johansan did a great job.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|After reading the first two, I can't believe how bad this was. Missed the boat completely. I was really really disappointed.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Love the show and being able to watch anywhere/anytime is just great. Love the Amazon video feature for my Kindle fire, it makes a good product even better
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Love the movie and all the extras were a lot of fun to watch. It made a great Christmas present.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I love Dexter. So I just had to read the books. They are well written and easy to read. You'll love them.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|While this series does not stretch your brain as much as the BBC series (which only has to produce three episodes a year!), it is still well done and well acted--especially Watson.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|My enjoyment of this book would have been enhanced if the author had ended it about two thirds of the way through. Most of the tension came from the same source (interpersonal romantic complications) and became repetitious. I enjoyed the cleverness and pace of the first portion of the book—more than I expected. But when the relationship hit a bump two thirds of the way through, my only reaction was “here we go again”.  Otherwise the writing carried the story pretty well. If I find something by this author in another genre I’d read it. Mira Lyn Kelly has the skills to tell a good story.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|Amazing to watch Coldplay from their Paris concert. The story line was interesting and the band was well documented. Excellent purchase
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Engaging from both a visually aspect as well as writing and creativity. I thought this movie really did a great job of tranferring you to the time they visit and is just a unique approach. Plus the acting was just great! I have enjoyed Owen Wilson in his comedies, but really thought he did a superb job in this. Another Woody classic!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I love good scifi books and this one keeps you riveted to your seat for hours on end. It is the story of a man who went to Mars with a crew and is left behind when they think him dead after a terrible storm hits them upon their departure for Earth and how he manages to survive until he is safely rescued.The amount of detail the author manages to  convey about this man's survival skills and his desire to live is moving. It is that innate desire to survive that has him come up with ingenious life saving (or shall I say  life prolonging) devices, salvaging parts from equipment left behind by previous Mars explorers. But you must read it. It has many surprises, especially dealing with how to grow food on Mars. You can't help to identify yourself with this very flawed but resilient character.
B001S86J1C|5.0|A great coming of age movie, especially for anyone who was growing up in the 80's. One of Broedericks best!
B002SSBD6W|5.0|The straightforward facts and the author's relatable journey in this book forced me to choose to finally go vegan, or to consciously choose to continue contributing to suffering.  Do not read this if you would rather live in blissful ignorance.  I found this book eye-opening, educational, and it confirmed my belief that being vegan is a way to leave a positive mark on the world.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|What to say, you either already love this movie and are going to buy it or you dont. Anyone who has yet to see this or the franchise, well you have to start here, but remember this movie is going on 30 years old, so the effects aren't as they are now, but the movie was great for its time and the story still holds up!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|i really like this because it wakes me up automatically for school and since i have to walk to school its really helpful. i really recomend this. take it from a 7th grader haha jk but yeah get this app :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you buy this one you wont be disappointed. I started reading this and didn't really put it down till I read the whole thing. I loved everything about the story line and the characters. Kind of sorry that I'm done with it :(

1907590331|5.0|How could I presume to review Steinbeck,...his writing is almost perfect. None of today's politically  correct stuff, just a rationalistic style good book.<br />Many modern TV themes have been taken from this book including a lot of Loony Toons cartoons.<br />Steinbeck s George and Lennie theme is the basis for much of modern day juxtaposition .

B009K0P10K|5.0|I am addicted to this show. It has more twists and turns than the Autobahn! Everytime I think I've figured out a storyline (and there are myriad storylines within the larger plot), another character and storyline presents itself. &#34;Revenge&#34; has something for everyone from family secrets, deception, murder, espionage, sex to the beautifu wickedl and wealthy people who live in their Ivory Towers. The women and men with whom I've discussed the show absolutely LOVE it. If in doubt, watch the Pilot. If you're not immediately drawn into the plot whilw begging for more ,perhaps you will be happier watching a mindless Sit Com.

B008GFI4V8|2.0|First of all, the aspect ratio is stated as 1.77:1 in Product Details section. The aspect is not 1.77:1, but 2.40:1. Secondly, it is written in Editorial Reviews section that theatrical version is applicable. However, there is not theatrical version in any of the discs.<br />I do not understand how Amazon permits this kind of goods sold on its web-site!!!

B000BJS4TO|5.0|After my friend let me borrow this movie for the first time, I couldn't help but go buy the soundtrack! First of all I collect amazing soundtracks, but this one stands out as you watch the movie, it's beautiful! John Williams is a genius anyway, but this soundtrack further proves it. Definitely a must for any score collectors out there!

0812992792|5.0|Beware -- this is a horror story.  But life in North Korea is a brutal horror, so it is probably not far off of the truth.  I recommend this as a fascinating, tightly drawn story told in simple, direct language.  If you are interested in the puzzle that is North Korea, or you are one of those people who can't turn away from a horror, you will enjoy this.  Again, however, it is not for the faint of heart.
B000002PCS|5.0|This gift was bought by my first late husband.  He loved me so much. He would let me hear it and watch the movie 100 times over and over. He would just go outside and let me enjoy. It is so moving.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I have received the product and feel very satisfied with the movie and your presentation is just awsome i like very much the image and the music.<br /><br />thanks
B0039208QM|3.0|Tim Burton's \\"Batman Returns\\" is a difficult film to review because when I watch it I have the feelings of nostalgia as with the previous film and its following sequels (which I will review in the coming days). Despite these feelings that come up every time I see this film, I cannot ignore or deny the numerous flaws and non-sensical things that come up at frequent points during its 2 hour runtime. One of my favorite scenes in the film deals with Christopher Walken's character, Max Shreck confronting Selena Kyle (pre-catwoman) about his protected files. It shows both Pfeiffer's vulnerability as Selina, and Walken's humor as Shreck. Another great scene involves Selina smashing her apartment to pieces, after her tragic \\"she went nuts\\" transformation that this film uses to explain the motivation for Selina's actions as Catwoman. Despite this being very entertaining, as with the original that came out three years prior, but the flaws that plagued the original groundbreaking film seem to be even more apparent, which drag this film down on a narrative level.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-Very Entertaining From Start to Finish<br />-Nice Christmas Setting<br />-The Ice Princess is beautiful! (But has no real name!)<br />-Another Great Performance from Michael Gough as Alfred<br />-Great Batmobile and Batboat Action Sequences<br />-Michael Keaton Delivers as Batman (despite his Bruce Wayne being even more reclusive than last time)<br />-Christopher Walken gives a good performance as Max Shreck<br />-Once again, the Gotham City set design falls in line with the dark gritty atmosphere presented with the comic book source material<br />-Batman gets some more screen time (slightly more, not a huge improvement)<br />-Danny Elfman's score is maintained and even improved from the previous film<br />-Decent action scenes and set pieces<br /><br />The Bad:<br />-Even More Plot Holes!<br />(I wont go over each and every one like last time)<br />-Where did the Red Triangle Gang obtain thecomplete and correct visual specs of the Batmobile?<br />-Why is Bruce so hung up on Selina Kyle?<br />-Danny Devito's Penguin is great, and he gives a great performance, but the character is too ghoulish and dark looking, especially with that black-green bile that came out of his mouth<br />-Once again, as with the previous film--Burton and Co. don't get the essence of Batman's character---he operates as a non-lethal character. Why is he killing a few of Penguin's goons? Why does he feel so good when he does that?<br />-How did Shreck and his Son (who looks like he should be the captain or quarterback of the Gotham Football team)come to Gotham City and what happened to chip's \\"late mother\\"? Who was Chip's \\"late mother\\"?<br />-A lot of what batman does in the film makes no sense!<br />-Despite Her excellent performance, Pfeiffer's catwoman and her transformation is explained as \\"she went crazy\\" after falling 25 stories down. Her character is really better served as a woman of her own merit, or a woman who commits her actions simply because she wants to--or in order to survive (despite that great scene when she destroys her apartment).<br />-Script is really awful this time---too many one liners--more stunt casting and emphasis on the villains rather than focusing on Batman himself--which relegates Keaton to a supporting role in what should have been his own movie; the story is disjointed and comes together like a series of unconnected episodes<br />-Bruce Wayne has no real public persona, which keeps viewers uninterested<br />-Max Shreck's Power Plan has no real basis or explanation in the film<br />-Commissioner Gordon, despite being the second most important character in the Batman mythos still has nothing to do!l<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />The plot is an absolute mess! It barely makes sense, without a serious suspension of disbelief from the audience. Still, this film brings out a lot of memories for me and is still good on many levels, but on a narrative and character level, it falls flat! An entertaining ride, nevertheless.<br /><br />3 out of 5 Stars.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|I have received the product and feel very satisfied with the movie and your presentation is just awsome i like very much the image and the music.<br /><br />thanks
B009GEYX5E|1.0|I don't understand how The Impossible Project gets away with ripping every one off with this film.  As though the price of the film isn't crazy enough, you now only get 8 pictures per pack - not 10.  The developing time is much longer than it took for a real polaroid picture to develop, but it still develops clear which is a plus.  I never minded paying for polaroid film when it was being made by polaroid - but that was $17 for 10 prints.  With The Impossible Project, though, it really does bother me that they are taking advantage of their ability to make the film.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I have received the movie and feel very satisfied with the movie and your presentation is just awsome the book is beatiful<br /><br />the package came in perfect conditions. i recomend this product totally<br /><br />thanks
B004QX07G4|3.0|Just chapter after chapter of silliness - doesn't give much insight to Ms DeGeneres' life just a series of bits - read it because I paid for it but would not recommend it to anyone
B009X011UQ|2.0|So this case definitely covers my kindle which is the point but it is a lot less impressive than I thought it'd be. First, it opens from the opposite side a book does, which I think is just a function of the kindle itself, but I hate that. Also, it isn't very secure when it's in \\"stand-up\\" mode; there's also only one way to stand it up (some other covers have multiple angles in \\"stand-up\\" mode). I think you can find a better kindle cover for your forty buckaroos! If I weren't such a procrastinator I'd have sent mine back to get something else.
0399160450|1.0|I've never read Tom Clancy before (and now I know why).  I was looking for a mindless page-turner, and I got mindless alright.  Not really a page turner because one knows exactly what's going to happen next (I think I kept reading expecting that what I expected wouldn't be and the novel would get interesting, but that never happened).  Incredibly predictable with absolutely nothing left to the imagination.  Mind-numbingly uni-dimensional and bland characters with ridiculous amounts of unrealistic patriotism - ie. very few Americans die in situations where they most likely all would...  Basically 4 guys take on the entire Chinese military and win... He treats the reader with 'kid-gloves' and makes sure we don't get 'sad' (or apparently confused).  Actually as I write that it occurs to me that this novel stirred zero emotions in me at all, which after all, is what we want entertainment to do, isn't it?  I'd pass.  I can't believe I read the whole thing.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie has been a favorite Christmas tradition in our family for many years and we are all happy to have a DVD instead of our old VHS version.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|A weak plot, and very little excitement make for a quick but unfulfilling read.  This must have been the last book in a contract deal.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This one starts out a little slow, but once you get into it, it's really good. I would definitely reccommend it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I absaloutly LOVE this great game that puts you in the shoes of a young dragon owner starting kind of like a zoo for dragons. this game is great I hope my review helped!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I watched this because AARP listed it as one of the top 10 movies for adults in 2012.  I enjoyed it. I found it to be heartwarming and hopeful.  The cast is exceptional.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|A very captivating story of a true AMerican hero who overcame all odds to become one of the most decorated Gentle Warriors in US history.  The book takes you through the difficult times all the way up to the battle that ended his life.  This story makes you proud to be an American.  Well done.
B0012GMW0C|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />This is the first Journey album, & in my opinion their best. The first three albums were before Steve Perry, each one after the first, inching it's way towards a more commercial sound. Later cemented, or buried, by the inclusion of Steve Perry on vocals.<br /><br />\\"Journey\\" is by far their most adventurous album, with ambitious prog rock bordering on fusion. The writing & playing level is ace! This is a Journey that the casual listener would not recognize, & most likely would not embrace, but those of us that enjoy our rock from the outer rim of creativity, this is a masterwork. Dazzling, yet warm, it embraces my ears with the sweet sound of a band at the top of their game. Doing complicated music not to show that they can, but a natural extension of their musicianship & creativity. Following their own muse, not someone else's.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is SOOOO well written. The twist and turns are not usually predictable, and it definitely keeps you pushing play. The best suspenseful movie on television! The acting is wonderful too!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I loved this so much I bought a second one for my sister... This is just a beautiful keepsake of one of the all time classics...
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Love this show.  Once you watch the first episode of the first season you'll be hooked too! this season is great
159102594X|5.0|Joe Abercrombie, (The Blade Itself and related installments) , have been the foundation on which I have rebuilt my love for reading. This most recent purchase was for a co-worker of mine that used his cheapness as a barrier of entry into the Joe Abercrombie universe.<br /><br />He has since purchased every book from The Blade Itself to Red Country.<br /><br />If you would like an extended synopsis, I suggest finding someone who is more worthy than I to right it. However, I will happily answer any questions if you are on the fence.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|this show is great! I like this season more than the first.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves thrilling shows that are constantly good... don't have to know what happened the first season to watch
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This was bought as a gift.  I have not listened to it yet, but heard them in concert a few weeks ago and I know it will be great.
B005PK553C|5.0|cool show! very hard to stop watching once you have every episode available on your DVR or on here! 5 stars
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Just got the CD.  I have just listened to it and it is great.  It is my first time listening to her.
B00783NWB6|5.0|It was shipped quickly; my son really liked it; I liked it and it even played good on his adroid
B001R4BTSU|5.0|loved this record! fast shipping and great quality! overall a very good purchase with no scratches like some other records can have! buy it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Really enjoyed this latest installment of Detective Bosch latest adventure.  A great read.  Hopefully Detective Bosch and Michael Connelly don't retire soon.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is a raw and powerful book and one hell of an epistemological journey.  Thank you Cheryl for this extraordinary novel!  As a person who participated in an Outward Bound experience and as a person who lost their mom at age 16, this book moved me deeply and touched my soul!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its a good time. if you get this app,  your going to have a good time. word of advice though,  save the money you get on this. it'll pay off later if you need it for something.
0525953728|3.0|Present for someone else who enjoys reading. This will enable them to relax with a good book that they have a direct interest in.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I am a  big Step-Up Fan! Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, BAM it did. I have already watched this movie ten times since Christmas. It is an awesome movie for the whole family!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all the hype I was expecting to be blown away.  Instead, I was left with the impression that the author was trying to rewrite Twilight
B006PFC2S2|5.0|Although it was filmed on a sound stage, and this shows occasionally, I love the drama, music, and romance that make up this splendid musical.  I think I like every single one of the songs, and the Gathering of the Clans is thrilling!  This is a movie I could watch over and over again.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie was great. The style was retro and offbeat and it was really well done. I would recommend it for sure :)
B00004YRBC|5.0|A Masterpiece on vinyl can only make it better. This is a great buy if you're a fan of their music!
0590259385|4.0|My 2 year old loves this book. He calls out the actual animal of the mothers - &#34;Must be a ... !SWAN!&#34; The rhyming is cute although it's not as smooth on the last verse. It's not so simple as to render the reader catatonic after multiple readings.
B008XNPO20|5.0|This is one of the best albums of the year (which is quite a big deal with all the great music this year), and it sounds even better on vinyl!
B00AECDDYY|5.0|The third Island to me was way to easy playing the game every other day for 30 minutes it took me 3 weaks to beat it
B000YXMMAO|5.0|Vinyl is definitely the way to go if you really want to enjoy this album. This is my favorite one to liven up the room!
