B000001FMC|5.0|Just picked this up at the Flea Market because I knew the 2 hit songs. So never having heard this till nearly 2011 I have missed out until now. The songs are all good with an uptempo smooth flavor. Maybe a little dated sounding but I'll take that over up to date crap they play on the radio these days.

B003NHRGSQ|5.0|One of the greatest series in the whole world. Maggie Stiefvater has this way with words that are so.... i dont know itz hard to explain but itz mad good. Oh and a heads up there is a couple of new wolfs to the pack. I would recomend this book to eveyone ecspecially Twilight fans. When i finished linger it brough me to tears....literally...about 5 minutes ago. I am mad hype now. I cant wait for Forever to come out. I will die of suspense waiting for it. So anybody who hasnt read linger yet... get off your lazy butt and get linger AND shiver but read shiver FIRST because itz the first in the series.So yea thatz my review on linger by Maggie Stievater.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The final book of the Hunger Games, a thrilling, provocative series that challenges the norm and enchants readers alike. It's a bit different, and frankly, I was not caught under its spell. First off, its all one big jumbled rush to get things done. Its a race that involves everyone dying extremely quickly, the Capitol getting angrier, and war breaking out. Somewhere along the way, Katniss Everdeen turns from the defiant face of the Resistance to a feral animal. The ending was sub-par, with Collins rushing to tie up her storylines in a mere ten pages, resulting in a pathetic attempt at a heart stopping conclusion. I was nowhere near satisfied.
0385528752|4.0|Switch is about How to Change when Change is Hard.  I devoured  it, finishing two-hundred and fifty-eight pages in five and a half  days--all while I continued my normal habits of reading the Bible every  day and reading my RSS feeds and flight test research as well.<br /><br />Chapter 11 begins: \\" 'A long journey starts with a single step'...but you know what else  starts with a single step? An ill-conceived amble that you abandon after  a few minutes.\\"<br /><br />I laughed out loud when I read that, but it's so true.  The difference between the two is only apparent after you've started, so imagine how much time and energy you waste with false starts.  So let me back up to the first steps of my journey through this book.<br /><br />The first thing that jumped out at me is the use of the Rider and Elephant example, a mental image that the authors use to illustrate the \\"who\\" of change.  I am a firm believer that a picture is worth a thousand words, and this is a vivid one.  Our minds are the Rider, and our passions are the Elephant.  So even when we can logically argue that change is good and describe how to change, we've still got to motivate the passions of the people involved in the change.  Armed with this picture, we begin a journey through a repeatable process, a checklist, for change.<br /><br />Secondly, the authors outline a process that is much like Chart the Course.  And they suggest that small, incremental steps are the best way to proceed with the largest changes, just like ATOMs-small, fundamental analytical principles-are the best catalysts for technical leadership innovation.<br /><br />I intend to implement some part of this methodology immediately.  For example, I believe that social media can serve as a catalyst for transformational innovation in flight test.  But I might scare the Elephants if I say something like that.  So I'll start by posting a brief paragraph in the SETP Linked In group explaining how to subscribe to an RSS feed and suggest a few helpful aerospace and flight test feeds to read.<br /><br />Why should you read it? To be inspired to set out on the most monumental of change journeys, to find the hope that you can achieve it, and the tools to equip you for the trip.<br /><br />When should you read it? Immediately...before starting any of your New Year's Resolutions (unless reading is one of them).<br /><br />Who should read it? Here's a short list:<br /><br />Anyone who believes that repeatable, scalable processes might be a valuable tool.<br /><br />Anyone who has a personal habit that needs to be changed.<br /><br />Anyone in an organization that isn't perfect.<br /><br />Anyone who leads at any level of any sized team.feeds to read.

0380820846|5.0|I fell in love with Daphne and Simon so much in THE DUKE AND I that I didn't think any of the other Bridgerton novels would live up to that expectation.  After reading ROMANCING MISTER BRIDGERTON, however, I concede defeat.  This was perhaps my favorite novel in the series so far.  Penelope has been mentioned in previous novels, and I was delighted to see her finally get a happy ending of her own.  Colin, a known rake from earlier books, is a perfect hero in this story.  Their love story is completely believable; the romance is very well-developed.  There's not an \\"Aha!\\" moment, when the characters look deeply into each other's eyes and realize they've fallen.  Instead, this is a very sweet romance about two people who form an attachment as they discover they have more in common than they'd ever realized.  Julia Quinn's writing is masterful in this novel.  I was hooked in the first chapter and captivated until the very last.  You'll need to have the 5th book on hand (or at least on its way) before you start this one.  The next story somewhat overlaps this one, and there are many hints to it in this 4th book.
B00005RHGK|5.0|This one has it all!  It's Ed Gein meets Hitchcock meets Gargoyles.  I can't say enough about this fantastic movie.  I have turned so many friends onto this flick and they can never get enough.  I really can't wait for it to see a proper blu-ray release.  The second installment isn't as good, but still worth while if you dig the first one.  This isn't your average teen slasher flick, this is a real thriller.      Creature fans may also like to know there is currently a prequal in the works telling of the monster's origin.  Anybody that ties a classic creature with an old time, jazzy standard is brilliant in my book!  One of my all-time favorites!
B00275EHJG|1.0|Can't believe I'm canning a Pixar movie.  Prior to Toy Story 3, they just couldn't do anything wrong in my eyes.  I watched this, disbelieving, and it felt like Pixar Studios had been hijacked or something.    I'm completely puzzled by the 4 and 5 stars this is getting.  Are these reviewers the same ones who loved the first two Toy Story movies, Monsters, Inc., Wall-E?  The brilliance, laugh-out-loud hilariousness and charm of those and others?  This, folks, is not in the same class.    I think I got one laugh through the whole thing. It was just such a dark story, with too much in the way of ominous themes - hostage-taking, threatened dismemberment, imminent death by fire and the list goes on.  Sure, our heroes have faced threats and dangers before, but it didn't hit the right tone in this one.  It was too \\"real\\".  There was a feeling of dread that overshadowed everything.    Worst of all was the villain.  I've had 30-something years to become de-sensitized to all sorts of horror movies and such, but the bear villain in this (and the sidekick villain babydoll) gave me the CREEPS.  If I had kids, no WAY would I be enthused about them seeing this.  Not just for the themes, violence and creep-factor, but because through-and-through - and even at the very end - this movie is dark and depressing.  I wish I had never watched it.    Steer clear of this and see How to Train Your Dragon instead.  Far, FAR superior in all respects.

B004DCB62M|3.0|It was a a treat to actually have graphics on a Holmes' collection where it is required on some cases. I haven't found that feature on the free titles on Amazon. But it's plagued with formatting problems when you adjust the text size. Seems to work well on the smallest setting, then it doesn't adjust as you go higher so you end up with sentences an inch long down the page.     On the upside, it has the Casebook of Sherlock Holmes which isn't in any of the free titles (yet).    As far as content, no need to elaborate on how this is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's best work.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|Four for content - Matt Smith is excellent, though I still prefer the Tennant era. However, my complaint here is that the S5 box-set shot up from $51 to $68 overnight, while Barnes & Noble still has it for $40... What the hell, Amazon??
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I loved this book.  I have read all 3 books by Kate Morton and have enjoyed all immensely.  This book was long and perhaps I don't disagree with a previoius review that it was too wordy in some places but the conmplex story, rich character development and satisfying ending more then make up for that that.  I couldnt put this one down and I can't wait for Ms. Morton's next story!!!
B003VANOFY|2.0|Ok heres the deal, this headset is unusable to me because of a feature that they added on it.  The headset auto shuts off after 10 minutes of inactivity coming through the headset.  I am guessing they did this to prevent the battery from draining while in wireless mode, which makes sense.  I dont understand though why, when the headset is plugged in, it still shuts off.  You can be using your computer reading a document, and if you dont have any sounds coming out of the headset in that time they will shut off.  So then when you go to do something with sound, you need to press and hold the power button on them for about 5-10 seconds.  Sometimes that wont even work, and you need to unplug the cable from the headset and replug it in.  I cant understand why they dont have options to adjust this in the software, but they dont.    So unless you want to constantly be turning your headset back on, stay far away from this.  Otherwise they work good, but not the most comfortable compared to the razer and steelseries I have had.
0312600844|5.0|Others can go into detail why, so let me say this novel is one of the best I have read: characters who inhabit their lives so fully you feel you can run into them; insights into what means to be human on every page; comedy and tragedy dancing together. I am a fan of Franzen but would not hesitate to write a negative review if warranted. This is a great read, and will reward the reader time and time again.

0307454541|1.0|Too much hype for this book that isn't deserved. Sup with that? Why the excitement over something so ordinary with the exception of a main character who is basically a goth-chick? I read this and thought...its okay...somewhat unique...average at best. I think it got popular from the marketing. The covers are eye-catchy. The guy is no longer alive and BOOM. Insta-hit. You would be better entertained with the man himself...Michael Connelly. He knows real crime fiction because he lived it first hand.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|One of the best comedies on television, and hits the spot with almost every episode. The show is about one big extended \\"modern\\" family, and everyone gets their chance to shine depending on the episode. I think my favorite is probably Phil, the dad, who I suppose is the main character and is stuck with a child's heart living in a grown up world. His son Luke is hilariously stupid at times. This show reminds me in some ways of Arrested Development just in the way that the entire thing is built around the one family and its characters, and every episode is centered around a particular joke and ties everything together. Give it a shot! It will only take an episode or two and you'll be hooked!
030745455X|1.0|Who likes this book? People that haven't read good books I can tell you that. I couldn't even finish this thing. Now, maybe I will like it years from now. Because I do have that tendency. For instance, I used to hate Lee Child. Now I flipping love his stuff. Same with the Bosch books by Michael Connelly. Now I can't get enough of them. I even sleep with them. But only because I will fall asleep while I hold it. Like a teddy bear. Although a teddy bear is soft and cuddly. Whereas a book made of paper and cardboard is not cuddly.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|At the time of writing this, I will be the 79th five-star rating out of 83 total ratings. I would give Community 6 stars if I could. This is hands down the best, most hilarious show on television. I've already bought five copies of this DVD for myself and others, and I'm certain I will purchase more. The self referential humor is great, the casting is outstanding, and the scripting is fantastic. You haven't lived until you have watched the best \\"couple\\" on TV, Troy and Abed. This DVD would be worth the purchase just for their outro from each episode. In two years of watching this show now, it's only missed on two episodes. Fantastic brilliant comedy - give it a shot. Worth every penny.
B004222UCS|5.0|This seventh star is one of my favorite black sabbath albums, Tony Iommy take Glenn Hughes on his band and this is a good thing to do, It's the first black sabbath album without Geezer, Bill, Ozzy and Ronnie James Dio, this is a different sabbath album, but It's simply great. No stranger to love It's an unforgettable song, and Glenn is a Great singer.<br /><br />The second cd is from seventh star tour, without Glenn but with Ray Gillen, a legendary singer who died in the 90's and did great things with black sabbath and Jake E Lee's Badlands. The sound of the live in not really good, but you will love Ray sings the classic black sabbath songs.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Awesome action, awesome comedy. This movie is for anyone who likes a good laugh, and maybe enjoys seeing some zombies getting splattered along the way. It has a great story line and will be a favorite for any fan of zombie movies. Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg at their best!!!
B004222UC8|5.0|I don't think this was a great time for the band, they were underated, but believe me, this is the only cd I like from the Tony Martin years,Do you know why?<br />Because the songs are born with Ray Gillen on Vocals and they are one of my favorite of all black sabbath history.<br />Tony Martin is a great singer but Ray was absolutely the best!<br />You will listen the demos with Ray in the second cd.

0525423273|5.0|Anna's parents decide she should attend a boarding school in Paris. This sounds like a dream come true to most teenage girls, but Anna is bummed about missing senior year with her friends back in Atlanta. There is also the stress of being the new kid at a school where friendships have had 3 years to form. She quickly becomes friends with a group of teens that includes the dreamy St. Clair. Anna is falling hard, but not only does St. Clair have a college girlfriend, but their mutual friend has the hots for him bad. What's a girl to do?<br /><br />A boarding school book set in Paris! Yippee! I love Paris, and was totally enthralled with the author's description of the sights and sounds. I've had the opportunity to visit the City of Light twice, and now I'm longing for a third vacation to the romantic city. I felt that deviating from the typical east coast setting helps this one to stand out among the others. Once you start reading you just fall in love with the world and characters the author has created. The tension between Anna and St. Clair grows to monstrous proportion. So all you sexual tension fiends are going to eat this one up with a spoon. St. Clair whose first name is actually &Eacute;tienne (isn't that the dreamiest name ever!) is such a great love interest, but some readers might find his wishy washiness frustrating. I thought it made for good book. Did I mention he has a British accent? Those who know me are aware of my love of cuties with accents.<br /><br />British Accent + A Sexy French Name = Love Interest Perfection!<br /><br />There is some angst. Anna gets a little emotional at times. Mood swings ensue, but I thought the author was keeping it real. I always wished I was one of those girls who didn't get weepy and emotional, but alas I am that girl. I related to Anna even though I'm no longer a teen. Please keep the not being a teen part between us ;) I enjoyed seeing Paris through her eyes, and witnessing her coinciding fall into love with an unavailable boy.<br /><br />Favorite part besides boys with accents? The food! The author goes into such detail about all the delicious foods lucky Anna gets to indulge in. I think I gained 10 pounds while reading. Yummy food, a beautiful city, and cute boys! Sounds like a win to me :)<br /><br />The writing in this book is top notch. The pacing is perfect. The characters are well developed. I can't rave enough about this one. 2010 is the year of amazing debut authors. I hope to see many more books from Stephanie Perkins in the future.<br /><br />My only complaint is the cover. Where is Anna's bleached streak and the gap between her front teeth? I loved those two little details about her. The cover model doesn't fit my image of Anna at all, but the book is still freaking amazing.t besides boys with accents? The food!

B0044XV3QY|5.0|Xmas day (2010), my husband and I spent the entire day (and night) watching the new Blu-ray Avatar movie, (The Extended Collector's Edition).  We LOVED the alternate ending, the deleted scenes, and all the extra's.    Originally we saw, (and fell in love with this movie), last Xmas (2009)..... We saw it at the movies in 3-D. (Which was Awesome).  This past spring, we purchased the Avatar \\"first release\\"... And have watched it countless times.  (We were delighted to see the Avatar DVD was wonderful even without the 3-D effects).    If you enjoyed the original version.... I think you will find the \\"Extended Collector's Edition\\" even \\"richer\\".  The deleted scenes answered many questions we pondered... and the \\"Extra's\\" are wonderful.    I have written no \\"spoilers\\" in my post... I will simply say: the \\"alternate\\" ending makes the movie even more \\"heart felt\\".  I don't understand why James Cameron deleted it. Yes, I understand they have \\"time\\" restraints... but the last deleted scene was needed.  My only guess \\"why\\" Cameron deleted it (and some other scenes) was to make the movie PG.  Avatar should be an adult movie (in my humble opinion).     I also found the deleted \\"love scene\\", the \\"hunt\\", and the \\"school house\\" wonderful and important to the story.  And, the other deleted scenes or rough graphic's answered many of our \\"pondered\\" questions.    In the years to come... when Cameron makes Avatar 2 and 3, ... I would love to see those rough graphic's \\"fleshed-out\\" and completed.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I bought it because I am a BIG fan of  Kristin Chenoweth.   \\"Glee\\" manages the balance well; it has a strong satiric pulse that doesn't diminish the characters' identities or dim the showmanship of a talented cast.   I am very happy that I purchased this  DVD collection.
B004EAQNO4|5.0|Though this movie has received mixed reviews from people I believe that this is actually one of the better heaven/hell movies i've seen in a long time.  The characters are developed enough for you to understand what is going on though throughout the movie you only really know three of their names.    There is just enough suspense to tide anyone over, the gore is almost virtually nonexistant which I was not expecting but was happy about.  I just feel that overall this is a good movie to show that anyone, and everyone, has done something in their lives that is terrible, yet it just goes to show that in the end EVERYBODY could have basically repented and been forgiven by those they have hurt...  Overall...this movie deserves all 5 of the 5 stars because it shows reality, anguish, forgiveness, and suspense all wrapped into one creepy movie! Enjoy! :)
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I felt as though I had spent the afternoon in Venice as we watched this movie. Johnny Depp's humor and charm always appeal, and Angelina Jolie's role was a bit of a pleasant change from our expectation. This movie is suspenseful, minus the blood and foul language, in a beautiful setting. So glad we didn't miss it!

0061478784|5.0|I watched the Miyazaki film many years ago, and though I did enjoy it overall I was rather unimpressed with the ending and some of the character development. However, one of my friends had read the book and had suggested I read it.  I finally picked this up the other day, and I couldn't put it down!  I have to say I didn't expect it to be nearly as enjoyable as I found it. Ms. Jones world is absolutely fantastical and fleshed out in such a way that it quickly moves her story along without seeming to skeletal and unrealistic. She also does an excellent job with giving her characters dimension. If you're looking for an epic fantasy, this is not it - as should be apparent in the book's size. However, if you're looking for that warm and fuzzy feeling from a fairy tale along with a dash of biting humor and raised eyebrows, you won't be disappointed!
B004FN2CZY|5.0|At first, I was quite annoyed as I did not think I had received my FREE audiobook as promised in the book titles description  - Well in fact I hadn't, turns out that right at the very end of the book, their is a link to Project Gutenburg website where you can download a free copy of an audiobook version of the title.     But, do not be mistaken in your belief that your getting a professional recording along the lines of Audible audiobooks, no this is a reading by volunteers at the Project Gutenberg website. I haven't played it yet, but I have had some of them before, and to be honest, I don't think I would have bothered within this edition of A Christmas Carol if I'd known, as the quality of recording and reading of these leave a lot to be desired.     Having said that, if your not bothered about the audiobook, don't forget the illustrations as they ARE included and have been taken from the original book, which I think was published in 1843, but whether this particular book and it's illustrations are from that edition, I cannot tell. All the same they are very nice to have.    Shame about the audiobook though.
B00275EHJG|5.0|this was a great buy. i got for about 14 dollars. which was the cheapest i could find. my little brother really enjoys the movie.
B0037KMHRY|4.0|I'm not necessarily a Daft Punk fan, nor am I a fan of electronica in general, but this soundtrack is an exceptional piece of work - as ground-breaking as the technology behind the movie itself. Fusion of the London Orchestra and Daft Punk is seamless, transporting you to a fantasy digital world. The music on this soundtrack was instrumental to making this fantasy world come to life.    Jump on your Lightcycle and take a spin with the TRON: Legacy soundtrack!

0312600844|1.0|I bought this ONLY because it was an Oprah selection.  I wasn't crazy about Franzen's first book, so I was wary to buy this one.  I should have gone with my gut and not spent my money.      The book is full of too much that doesn't really have anything to do with the plot.  He goes on and on and on and on until you want to poke your eyes out with a fork.  There is little to no humor, with everyone in the book leading miserable lives.  The dialogue is stilted, the book is dry.  I just wanted this book to be OVER.  Ugh.  It took me weeks to read this book (I typically read 3-5 books per week) because it was sssoooo not a good book (I'm being nice here), but I felt compelled to see it through to the end.      I don't have one good thing to say about this book, and I can typically find a something nice to say about most anything, but not this book.
0312370849|5.0|You will go through the gamut of emotions with this book.   I couldn't put it down.  It is definitely one for a movie.  I loved the author's way of reverting from one period to another and blending the 2 worlds together.

And dogs, I have three dogs, but did I really want to read a book about a dog?  I wasn't sure.  What I can tell you is that this book has something for everyone!      Denny's analogies make you stop and think, and at times Enzo will make you laugh until your sides hurt.  This book is definitely in my top ten.  I came away from this book with tears in my eyes, and an ache in my heart.  This book will make  you laugh and cry.  You can't go wrong with this book, take it from a girl who doesn't like car racing!!
B00008G7UJ|1.0|I couldn't take Romeo + Juliet seriously because people holding handguns in modern day but speaking like 16th century yeomen. It's a joke, really. I don't know why hollywood keeps churning out crap like this; if you are going to make a shakespearean movie, the setting should at least somewhat line up with the lingo. The actors can't even act; it feels like they are just reading the text out of their high school english books. The only good movie that follows this trend is Hamlet starring Kenneth Branagh (or however you spell his last name), and that's because the dialogue could pass for the time in which the story is set (and Kenneth is an awesome actor, but thats beside the point). Avoid this like the plague.
1400052173|5.0|This is typically not my genre, but after my cousin strongly recommended the book I finally bought it about six months later.     This is an amazing journey not only for the author, but for the entire family of Henrietta Lacks.  Skloot takes the reader on many journeys at one time.  I learned so much about the history of the medical field that it makes me extremely grateful for modern medicine and the laws we now have thanks to Henrietta Lacks.  The journey of Deborah and Skloot was tenuous at times and I was sad at the end (no spoiler here), but truly enjoyed reading and learning SO much about Henrietta Lacks.      Thank you, Henrietta for all you did for me and millions around the world.

B001PJ7TUE|5.0|Best album yet by The Prodigy! Amazing production full of hard hitting aggro-techno punk and industrial layers of fun. This album exceeded my expectations and no Prodigy fan's collection is complete without this essential recording. Awesome music! My favorite Prodigy album to date.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|This headset is killer Makes video games way better. Other reviews mentioned a hissing sound but I haven't noticed it yet. I've only had theme three days now so I'll keep you posted..I've played Red Dead Redemption so much I was sick of it untill these came along you can hear what direction cougers,bears and other enemies are coming from as you couldn't before. Anywho I hope this helps you guys out. so far this has been an incredible gift.<br />Update 5/10/12<br />Junk..I've went threw 3 XP21's since then and they sound great but they're garbage..Go ahead and buy the Sony wireless headset. They are about $20 more but you'll not have to buy another set every 2 months like you will with turtle beach.So now I'm taking the 5 stars down to 1 star..I would give it 0 stars if I could..
B0043ISH6O|5.0|This movie score is worthy of an oscar nomination at the academy awards. A fantastic score and electronic music is due for recognition in the artistic community....and who better to represent the creative power of the electronic musician's potential than TRENT REZNOR OF NINE INCH NAILS!!! NOMINATE!!!!
1861085257|5.0|Super fast shipping. Received my book on Friday. Still reading it. Book is easy to understand because of the great photos and instructions. The techniques described in the book are excellent too. I will not copy what is in the book. What I have learned from the author so far has made me think about ways to develop my own techniques and that's what a good teacher does well. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in creating miniatures of anything, not just food.
B003N7GATM|4.0|Post-industrial and avant-rock artsy fartsy, experimental electro-rock and trip-hop, etc., etc., etc., ...who knows? I think it's simple...HTDA is another great work of art in Trent Reznor's creative powers...and this has the potentiaal to become a very exciting band if record sales will permit it.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|Eclipse is an amazing movie! I loved all the newborn vampires, and all the screen time Taylor Lautner got! It was close to the book, and I enjoyed the history of the Indian tribe. I believe it's roughly close to the real legends of the real tribe so that was fun. I felt some of the things that were kind of skipped in New Moon was filled in with Eclipse.       The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the inconsistency of how to kill a vampire. I didn't realize some shattered like glass, while others don't? In Twilight James was ripped to pieces while in Eclipse all they had to do was hit them real hard and they broke into tiny glass pieces. So I didn't understand that.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|An energetic and fun movie that only falters a little at the end. The characters are all very well fleshed out and lovable, and the pacing never leaves you behind or moves too slowly. The cinematography is great, and some of the visual tricks they employ look absolutely incredible.    If you liked or loved the comic book, you won't be disappointed by this adaption, which keeps a lot of the humor, all of the style, and a lot of the little moments from the books that made you love it in the first place.    If you've never read the books, you will want to.

0307454541|5.0|The type of mystery I'm used to starts off with a bang and takes you on a wild ride. This wasn't that. I found the first chapter kind of boring and the first third plodding. Then I hit page 219. This book's pace feels a little like the first hill of a roller coaster ride. It chugs up the hill and you wonder what all the hype is about, then at p. 219 it starts a free fall down the hill gaining momentum until the end. I read the first 219 pages in a week and the last 370 pages in two days.<br /><br />Plot summary:<br />Reporter Blomkvist is hired by rich patriarch Vanger to examine the cold case of how his niece Harriet disappeared 40 years ago. In their research Blomkvist and his unorthodox assistant Salander uncover gruesome family secrets.<br /><br />My opinion:<br />Holy cow is this good. The story is complex, rich, and in-depth. Most of the details you think are just color are actually significant so pay attention. Larsson may have written one of the most fascinating characters in fiction in Lisbeth Salander the goth, brainiac hacker. Blomkvist is an odd hero; he's ethical as a journalist though morally suspect in a Bohemian kind of way that is a lot more forgiving in a 25 year-old than in a 45 year-old. The characters may not be likeable to some, but they are complete, well-rounded, fascinating and complex. The plot is compelling if gruesome and disturbing at several points. Be warned.<br /><br />There were some writing style things that bugged me personally: A lot of the scenes start in one POV and end in someone else's POV (the pivotal office scene on p. 220 is an example). The names can get very confusing. Where most authors try to avoid even using the same letter in naming their characters, Larsson uses names like Henrik, Harriett, and Harold living on Hedeby Island off Hedestad. He'll refer to a character by three names such as: Berger, Erika and Ricky, but despite some of these minor annoyances, the story and characters are excellent.<br /><br />This book is compelling, fascinating, unique, unpredictable and not to be missed. It's complex and adult -- and definitely not for the under 21s in my opinion.npredictable and not to be missed. It's complex and adult -- and definitely not for the under 21s in my opinion.

B001NEK2GE|2.0|Wow.  Bought this to play FPS games.... Unfortunately for me, I didn't look to see if Linux drivers were available - nope, no drivers.    So, for Linux, I can't use this.  For Windows XP, I have been trying to get used to it.  It does feel comfortable, and it is very well built - it's solid.    The space bar on the keyboard is now a small button to the left of the joystick thingy.  I have big hands, and this is a bit cramped.  I find that I like the keyboard better.  The LCD is about useless... during gameplay, I am not going to look down at the screen.    I find that I cannot find the 'home' keys very well.  There is no 'bumps' to guide you to the home keys.  The indents are not deep enough to identify easily.    I have been having issues with windows since I installed, so have put it on the shelf for now.  I think it has to do with the drivers, but I cannot tell.    Wished I had not thrown all the packaging away.  No a good purchase for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I love when I feel that way about a book!! It was unlike any book I have read. The author paints a very vivid interesting new world and the main character is different than the typical heroin. It is appropriate for teens and adults and would make a great gift.
B002ZG981E|1.0|Besides receiving damaged packaging the audio on this bluray is not in sync with the picture. Warner Brothers should be shot for putting out crap like this. I give the bluray a big thumbs down due to manufacturing defect.
0618918248|2.0|I love Dawkins when he is writing about biology, but this is definitely not the rigorous Dawkins you knew from \\"The Extended Phenotype,\\" or \\"The Selfish Gene.\\" I am an atheist, but this comes as close to religion as the Republicans' idea of trickle down economics to real economics. If you hope to find any subtleties in thought beyond a very narrow view of religion, then you are in for a very bad ride.
B0027LZ4CE|5.0|Now that Karajan's DGG set of the Bruckner Symphonies #s 1-9 is available for only around $25, that is an even better value than this set, because Karajan owned Bruckner like no one else did, and those performances are definitive on most of the symphonies, but the Paternostro is still worth getting as a second choice, because it also contains the must-have Zero Symphony, which Karajan ignored. However, be forewarned that Paternostro is generally not in Karajan's league on Bruckner, not as monumental, and not nearly as mystical. But nobody else was, either.<br /><br />This set has the best Bruckner Fifth I have ever heard, and is good on most of the other symphonies, but poor on the Sixth (where the must-have recording is the hauntingly monumental one by Heinz Bongartz). It's only fair on the Zero (where the great Maerzendorfer  is unmatched, Rozhdestvensky the second-best, and Skrowaczewski a distant third-best). I give this set five stars because Bruckner is astoundingly difficult to conduct well, and because this set is the third-best set overall, after Karajan's set of only the numbered 9 symphonies, and Skrowaczewski's set of all 11 symphonies; this Paternostro set includes the 10, from 0-9, but no Double-Zero, \\"00\\". (Karajan's avoiding the Zero is a major deficiency in his set, since that symphony is greater than any written before Bruckner, and is better than some of Bruckner's numbered symphonies, so Karajan's set is seriously incomplete, even though the performance-quality is the best. For complete sets, Paternostro is third-best. Skrowaczewski is second-best. And only Skrowaczewski includes both the 00 and the 0 Symphony. But Skrowaczewski butchers the 00. So: I'd recommend: Buy Karajan 1-9, Rozhdestvensky's set of both 00 and 0, and you've got them all in excellent pderformances; but in order to have the greatest performances of each symphony, buy also Karajan's 1957 EMI 8th, Bongartz's Bruckner 6th, and Maerzendorfer's Bruckner 0.)<br /><br />Another reason I give this set five stars is its incredibly good value. At this price, every Bruckner-lover should have the Paternostro set (but only after first having Karajan's set).<br /><br />Paternostro's style is reverential, but lacking the craggy or rock-like character which is essential in some of Bruckner's symphonies. At this price, even Paternostro's worst Bruckner (0, 1, 6-9) is worth having, if only to encounter an interesting non-mystical way of performing these mystical works. For example, Paternostro's performances of the 8th and 9th show how good a performance of these supremely mystical works can be while lacking Bruckner's mystical side. To me, that's still fairly good, since everything else in the music comes through pretty well. It's not my taste in Bruckner performances, but still I am more satisfied than I am with such conductors as Wand, Furtwaengler, Celibidache, or Giulini. Perhaps listeners who like the approaches of one or more of those worldly or \\"dramatic\\" approaches to Bruckner will also like Paternostro's approach.<br /><br />And anyone who has never been fully satisfied with any recording of the 5th might find that this set finally provides what none other does: a performance of this work that is good in every way.<br /><br />The performance of the Te Deum (filler on the disc with #0) is also fairly good, but it is dwarfed by Karajan's 1984 definitive recording of the Te Deum, with Muller-Molinari, Perry, Winbergh, and Malta.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Let me first state: I have not read the comic book so I cannot comment on how true the film remained to the original content. That said, THIS MOVIE BLEW ME AWAY LIKE ONE OF THE SEVEN EVIL EXES!!! I've literally never seen anything like it! Edgar Wright is a genius. The filming, transitions, characters, dialogue, and special effects are fabulous! Witty, fun, and all around fantastic film for my generation of gamers! All the actors give stellar performances: Chris Evans as the cocky \\"pretty good skateboarder who turned pretty good actor\\", Brandon Routh as the not too bright but better than everyone else Vegan, Michael Cera as the mousy \\"wannabe lady killer\\", Kieran Culkin as the sassy gay roommate, Ellen Wong as the adorably sweet, but possibly dangerous stalker, Knives Chau, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona giving us the back story on the exes in comic book panels; all were terrific. I don't usually review movies, and you may or may not find this review helpful, but if you grew up when Nintendo was first released followed by Sega and all the rest, you just may see the awesomeness of this unparalleled film!
1439107955|5.0|A biography, a textbook, and a page turner.  Comprehensive and historical. A must for the average Joe who wants to know why we do not have a cure. Should be in every houshold.
0545123267|5.0|At the age of nine, Grace is torn away from a swing she is playing by a pack of wolves that come into her yard.  Surely she should have been killed, but one wolf - one with particular captivating eyes appears to save her.  Since that day Grace feels a connection with the wolves and sees the wolf with the eyes many times throughout the years around her home, almost as if he is watching her.  In an odd way, Grace is comforted by the wolf's presence.<br /><br />Then, when Grace is seventeen, a boy she attends school with is killed in a wolf attack and the hunters take to the woods.  Grace finds a boy on her doorstep with a gun shot wound... oddly, the boy has very familiar eyes... almost like her wolf...<br /><br />Yes, I did it.  After Shiver has sat on my book shelf for a long long time, I finally took the time to read it.  I had heard the comparisons to the Twilight series, and before you groan about me comparing books... there is a method to my madness....<br /><br />First of all... my only real dive into the paranormal as far as vampires, and wolves go is the Twilight books (other than The Passage, but that is really not a comparable book as that is so much a deeper/ complicated read).  And I have to admit after hearing buzz about Sam (Shiver) being a much more likable that Edward (Twilight), I had to bite...  (no pun intended.)<br /><br />Ok...maybe a little bit of a pun....<br /><br />In the early pages of this read as I was introduced to Grace and Sam, I started making a mental list of what I thought so far of the Sam/Edward comparisons:<br /><br />1.  I like that in Twilight we get to know Edward and meet Edward before we are introduced to the vampire side of him.  I found it harder to connect with Sam in the beginning and I feel that is due to me first knowing him as a wolf.  I felt I had to work harder to think of him as human.<br /><br />2.  I didn't find the love connection of Sam and Grace as totally captivating as Edward and Bella.  Edward's love for Bella made you have to book crush on his character as he is so emotionally there for her.  I didn't feel it as strong with Same and Grace although I found Grace a much more likable character than Bella.  No where near as ditzy.<br /><br />My initial plan as I read this book was to come up with a whole pile of comparisons for this review... I was actually excited about it and even thought about a separate post on Sam VS Edward, which maybe... as I read through this series may still happen - but not now and here is why:<br /><br />As I read on and shook off my prejudices, I really started to get into the story line and found it less easy to put the book down and leave it as I had in the early pages.  By the middle of the book I had driven to my local book store only to find out they did not have Linger and not wishing to wait, I ordered it immediately on-line.  I enjoyed the alternating  chapters told in each of the main characters voice.<br /><br />Today, I took the liberty of the holiday weekend to SHIVER under a new blanket from my hubby until I got warm and could LINGER through the end of this book.  I loved that it is set in my home state of Minnesota and I imagine as I am in central Minnesota that I am about two to three hours from Mercy Falls, where Sam and Grace are.<br /><br />In the end, I was really surprised and impressed on how much I enjoyed this read.  I  am looking forward to the arrival of Linger!as he is so emotionally there for her.  I didn't feel it as strong with Same and Grace although I found Grace a much more likable character than Bella.  No where near as ditzy.      My initial plan as I read this book was to come up with a whole pile of comparisons for this review...

0321704452|5.0|Reynolds is a speaker, consultant, a writer, and designer.  He is a long-time student of Zen arts - and is currently an Associate Professor of management at Kansai Gaidai University in Japan.  In his first two books Presentation Zen and Presentation Zen Design, he wrote about tools for planning and designing successful presentations.  In this book, he focuses on the delivery of the presentation...how presenters can deliver natural and memorable presentations that connect deeply with the audience.  Some of the key recommendations include:<br /><br />1) Think Conversation not performance - natural delivery is more like a conversation between friends than a formal one-way lecture.  Don't be boring.  Don't read your speech.  Make eye contact.<br /><br />2) Prepare.  Identify the purpose. (Start with 'Why?')  When you present you are trying to create change in people's minds.<br /><br />3) Establish \\"presence.\\"  Focus on the here and now.  Be present.  Take a risk and express your true self.  Be authentic.  Show your passion.<br /><br />4) Project yourself.  The Way you look.  The Way you move.  The Way you sound.<br /><br />5) Have pace in your presentation.  Attention spans are normally 10 minutes.  You need to mix it up.  Have the audience participate.<br /><br />6) Begin with a punch.  End with a powerful finish (inspire, tell a story)<br /><br />7) I thought this excerpt captured the essence of Reynold's teachings from the book:<br /><br />\\"I've always said that presentation is more art than science.  So what is art?...Set Godin said this about art in the context of work: 'Art is a generous action - it's when a human connects to another human and makes a change.'  The work that we do could be art, but if we are just following the rules, playing it safe, and sort of working-by-the-numbers (as in paint-by-numbers), then the work lacks connection and difference, and therefore lacks art.  The best presentations are works of art because the best presenters connect in thespirit of contribution and generosity and help people make a change.  The worst presentations are speeches are the usual ones, the ones that are perfunctory, route, safe and utterly forgettable.  Nobody ever got fired for doing the expected and the safe...Today, more than ever there are opportunities to speak in front of others to make a connection and contribution to lasting change - that is, to create art.\\"<br /><br />My thoughts on the book:<br /><br />1) Buy the Book - Skip Kindle.  I'm as \\"green\\" as the next reader - however this book is written to be read (and owned) in print and not on Kindle.  It is beautifully designed and intended to sit on your book shelf as a guide.  Masterful in its design - its look and feel is \\"Zen-like\\" if I can take it that far in description.<br /><br />2) This book is a quick and captivating read.  While Reynolds does not introduce much in terms of new concepts, I found his ability to distill the message to the core essence of what's important to connect with audiences to be worthy.  He practices what he preaches - this is a page turner for a self-help book - which holds your attention throughout.  The book is well paced and mixed with stories, quotes, tips from professional presenters and beautiful Zen art.<br /><br />3) Book is best suited for the advanced presenter.  There are better options for beginners and intermediate practitioners such as:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0470597143 How to Give a Pretty Good Presentation: A Speaking Survival Guide for the Rest of Us]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1449301959 Confessions of a Public Speaker]]

B002VPE1WK|5.0|We purchased this to hold an SLR camera. It not only holds that camera and lenses but also our point and shoot cameras and all the needed batteries and cords. The many pockets are nice for holding the instruction booklets and even a few snacks while walking around. It was very comfortable to carry for a long period of time and didn't move around as you moved. I would highly recommend this backpack for anyone that likes to hike with multiple cameras or lots of equipment.

B002QXI2L8|4.0|I love this opera and I love ballet, so I put this dvd in my wish list for Christmas. I got it. The music is wonderful and the singing is excellent.  At the end, they all got a prolongued standing ovation from the entire Paris Opera House, and I'm sure they deserve it. But it was  modern dance not ballet, and the entire going ons by the dancers seemed extrenous, superfluous to the music and singing, not an extension of it.  There is no explanation of why Orpheus appears naked and three of the male dancers are wearing leather aprons, or why a couple of the male dancers appear to be dressed in black suits. I personally, did not like it.<br />Many of the dance sequences were boring and seemed to go on interminably, distracting from the music,<br />This naked Orpheus did not look at all like the mythical demigod of the story, but just like a young, regular, male dancer.<br /><br />The best visual part of this DVD is the picture in front.

B002ZG996I|4.0|As a fan of romantic comedies, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex O'Loughlin, I loved this movie. Yes, it followed the typical plot structure and conventions of romantic comedies, but, so what? (Why aren't action movies, and other movies aimed at men, criticized for being even more formulaic than rom-coms? Only so-called \\"chick-flicks\\" are judged this harshly for following the structure of their genre.) I wasn't expecting a masterpiece that would sweep the awards shows. I was looking for some fun, heartwarming entertainment, and this movie delivers. Jennifer Lopez is wonderful at physical comedy, and we saw another side of Alex O'Loughlin. Having only seen him in intense, brooding roles, I was surprised at how well he delivered in a comedy. As a bonus, we also got to enjoy Tom Bosley in his final role, a bittersweet moment for his fans.
B00003CXRM|4.0|An amazing movie, \\"Oh Brother where art thou\\" is a classic unto itself.  Stunning cinematography ad incredible acting, the movie draws you into a web and refuses to let you go until the very ending.  Based on Homer's Odyssey with a southern twist, George Clooney, John Turturo and Tim Blake Nelson make an unforgettable trio of prison escapees making their way back home and encountering the trials and tribulations on their adventure.  There are parts that will make you laugh until you cry and there are parts that will make you misty-eyed.  In an age of that has seen seven Saw  movies, remakes of everything, and soon to be three Transformers movies, Oh Brother where art thou gives the viewer some much needed intellectual respect.
0143034901|5.0|I may update this review after I finish its' 486 pages, but 27 pages in, I am so hooked and intrigued by the story and the well drawn characters and settings I had to comment.  I initially was looking for a book on angels (and the author has written something with either that subject or related)and stumbled on this novel, I started reading about this story, the reviews, etc.  When I saw that there were used copies at reduced cost, I ordered it.  The book's condition was noted as \\"Very Good\\" and that was extremely accurate.  Just slight wear on the edges of the soft binding, but nothing else noting that it had been read by other people.  The supplier also had a great recommendation by its' name which added to my confidence and frankly my confidence in Amazon.com.  I will definitely order other items from Amazon in the future as I did many years ago.
B003XQPT9A|5.0|I love Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, and the Muppet version is actually one of the best film depictions of the story. It is, of course, Muppet-ized with some catchy musical numbers and humor. Using Statler and Waldorf as the Brothers Marley was truly cinematic brilliance.     I also rented this online with Amazon Video through my WiFi ready Roku, and it worked like a charm.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|This movie is a true classic. Kids and adults will love this movie. There are simple morals and beautiful scenery, accompanied by melodic music that just completes this movie into a wonderful story about discovering yourself, and your place in the world.
B002ZG980U|3.0|Ok I'm going to start off with what I liked about this movie.  Once again I was pleased with Dicaprio's performance, special effects were top notch!! I can honestly compare the effects to the Matrix. The storyline had so many twist and turns right from the first scene.<br /><br />Now what I didn't like about Inception.  I fell asleep on the movie, which rarely happens when I watch a well paced movie.  If you are the type of movie watcher that can not handle a detailed movie plot than I would suggest you rent \\"Devil\\" or something like that.  A dream inside a dream, in someone else dream, being attacked by people in a dream, creating a dream as a maze or a funhouse .. sorry I got lost on this one. I love movies that make me think and pay close attention to detail BUT this one left me in the beginning .. I didn't like Shutter's Island either I fell asleep soon after the opening credits.<br /><br />I will try to sum the movie up for those who want to know the storyline: In my opinion it was about criminal minded people (Dicaprio) and his buddies kidnapping people and entering their dreams only to twist their thoughts so back in reality they get whatever it is they want that person to do or think .. I hope that helped lol!<br /><br />I gave the movie 3 stars because the idea of the movie and the special effects are AMAZING but I kinda got sidestracked trying to keep up with the plot.

The topic doesn't sound like something I'd normally read, but a few pages in to the book and I was hooked. This is a very well written thorough history about Henrietta and the work of her cell donation. It hurt my heart to read how much she suffered before she died. We all owe her a world of thanks.

B0049SF8W4|4.0|I think most the many fight scenes were good. The story was good enough for me. I think it`s a pity that Sammo Hung had maximum 5 minutes on screen. I thought he would have a bigger role. He had more or less a cameo role.<br /><br />His fight (his only fight in the film) against Biao was good, but i wish it was longer. Sammo did some good, fast punches. Yuen Biao had a much bigger role and more fight scenes than Sammo, that was good. There was a few times they used wires in the fights. They didn`t bother me. Of all the Ip Man films, i must say i liked the first one with Donnie Yen best.<br /><br />Picture quality: 5/5<br /><br />I found the quality very good. I had no problem with it. It does look like a completly new film, as it should be.<br /><br />Audio quality: 5/5<br /><br />I only used the Cantonese: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track. I have only a 5.1 system, but it sounds like a new film. The bass was pretty good in the fight scenes and such. The dialog and music sounded great in the center speaker. The rear speakers was used for music and the fights. They was used many times. I think they sounds good. Overall, very nice track, as i assumed.<br /><br />Film: 3.5/5<br />Overall: 4/5
1844137872|5.0|I've always found Banksy's work to be interesting and definitely a unique and interesting style. This book showcases a wide variety of his art, from his sculptures to his famous stencils. One thing I probably liked the most was his commentary on several pieces. It gives you a feel of what actually goes into the secret process of a street artist. I have no regret buying and am enjoying the quality a ton.    -RESPRiT
B003R0LBVW|4.0|As a 46-year-old mother of two now grown daughters, I found Freedom an incredibly disturbing and yet comforting look at what it means to be an individual in the midst of family and marriage. As my youngest daughter prepares to go off to college I am left with both the space to self-reflect and the concomitant fear of doing just that. Freedom does quite a fascinatingly exquisite job of delving into the interior lives of its characters, in particular of Patty and Walter Berglund. A must-read for anyone approaching middle age, and perhaps for young adults who wonder why they have the parents they do and just who are these strange people anyway?
B003INBOEM|4.0|I am not a huge fan of Karate Movies, however I watched this movie twice already... Decent story line and the fight scenes were great... Definitely a guy movie though, my husband loves it.
B002VECM4A|5.0|This is a great movie. I could see using it as the basis for a college class on sexual predators and how they choose their victims. It would be great for discussion. There were a lot of questions that the movie left unanswered. Although the movie is about Precious, and the mom is portrayed as this evil bitch, you come to realize that her mother is a victim, too. That they are both victims of a sexual predator. What the movie fails to address is why the guy isn't arrested and put in jail for his crimes. Even though Precious ends up telling the social worker what he did, the social worker doesn't call the cops, she instead just blames the mom and herself walks away from it. The onus falls on the mother, instead of on the male sexual predator who used her in order to get to her child, Precious. I think that is a fault of what is otherwise a great movie. Another fault is this weird scene where Precious imagines she is white, like she thinks none of this would be happening if she were white. However, bad things happen to white people, too. Also, it doesn't fit in with the rest of the story as she consistently imagines herself as black and in a good place, except for the once. Except for these things, it is a great movie.
B003F256T0|5.0|I gave this gift to a child I don't know and I didn't see him open it (secret Santa type of thing), so I don't know anything about its durability, fun factor, etc.  All I know is that it was a hard to find item I found quickly and easily on Amazon and that it was shipped very quickly, arrived in excellent, gift-giving condition.  Very happy with purchase.
B001GCUO5M|1.0|I am so glad I got to see a library copy before I went out and bought this movie. It is a really bad movie. The plot is corny and unbelievable. It wasn't gripping or scary or anything besides boring. I found myself fast forwarding through much of it. Why would a simple cop with no special Arnie Schwarzenegger type training and who was in on the liberation of Dachau, yet who suffered no PTSD from this, go bonkers because his mentally ill wife killed his kids, kill her and then go insane himself, thereby becoming one of the most dangerous men in America, so dangerous that he needs a lobotomy to save the rest of us from him? Since he keeps looping like the guy in Groundhog Day, I say, leave him to it. And the crimes that brought the other people to this Shutter Island, a place for the most criminally insane people in America, so insane they cannot be held anywhere else, are laughable by today's standards. Even by the standards of the 1950s, they are laughable. We had the guy who used to kill and eat people, dressing them out like deer, in a hospital for the criminally insane right in the middle of our town. He was there until he died.  They missed the boat on this movie. I thought it was going to blow the lid off the bad things that used to (and maybe still do) happen in mental institutions, or the secret Nazi experiments in the US (we gave top Nazis a pass for their crimes in return for their sharing their knowledge with us), or the terrible things we did and do in the name of healing the mentally ill (the guy who invented the lobotomy just stuck an ice pick at random in people's heads, through their noses, I believe). Instead, it turns out the cop is the bad guy and the Nazi looking doctors and police are the good guys. What gives with this?  Personally, I think it is not worth watching. Borrow it from the library or rent it before you decide whether you want to plunk down dollars for it.
1600242405|5.0|Amazon's original product page listed Keith Richards as the reader, so I thought, what could be better than Keith Richards telling his own life story?  Judging by the short intro, the only part that Richards actually reads, it would have been amazing had he done so.  And the book itself is great, especially the parts about music and song writing, where Richards talks about how he developed his signature sound and came to play guitar with 5-string open tuning and why that matters to the Stones' sound.  The details of recording the albums are also incredibly interesting, as are Richards' assessments of his band mates.  There's not much sex in the book, not that there needs to be, although its absence seems a little bit forced, especially since the stories about Richards' drug use are so detailed. Richards is pretty unapologetic about his use of various substances, and his warnings against it read somewhat hollowly given how poetic he waxes about cocaine and heroin in particular, but the stories are entertaining.  Since so many people have reviewed the book in such great detail, however, I'll skip further details about the substance of it and cut right to the problems with the audio version.    After the enticing tease of the intro, the audio contains about 5 discs worth of material read by Johnny Depp.  Not the swaggering, Richards-imitating Jack Sparrow of the Pirates of the Carribean movies, but Depp speaking in an American-accented monotone.  Aside from the fact that this is downright boring, since this is the part of the book in which Richards talks of his childhood, having an American narrator is downright strange and undercuts the sense of  Richards' post-war working-class English upbringing.  Depp puts little pacing or spacing into his droning, which makes it hard to follow the narration since Richards tends to ramble a bit, something which is probably less problematic when you can actually see paragraph or section breaks.  After 5 or 6 discs of this, I was quite happy when the narration suddenly switched, with no warning, to Joe Hurley, who reads the remainder of the book with a broad Cockney accent.  But whereas Depp is downright deadpan, Hurley puts an EMMMM-phasis, on NEARly, EVVVVVery WORD in the ENTIIIIIRE SENTENCE, dragging out syallables, and all the while slurring as if he's drunk.  He  pauses frequently as if searching for the right... word, and laughs as if what he's said is really funny (which sometimes it is, but just as often isn't any funnier than anything else in the book).  It's hard to get across in print how annoying this rapidly becomes.  After awhile you start to miss Depp's monotone.  Also, while Hurley does sort of okay with the French words and place names in the book, he absolutely mangles the Italian and a few other things, which makes me wonder what else he mispronounces.  It sounds like he was reading the book for the first time in the studio, or that he read it once before but didn't bother to ask any questions.  He also has a really deep voice which, in the lower registers, is difficult to understand on the audio.    If you're at all interested in the Stones or blues music or the creative process, do yourself a favor and get this book.  But do yourself an even bigger favor and don't pay the extra money for this audio version, which is little more than a couple of gimmicks gone horribly wrong.
B000FC10H0|2.0|At first glance this book seems like a good buy. It goes directly into the 22 \\"immutable\\" laws and backs each one up with examples and explanations, as does its accompanying \\"11 immutable laws of internet branding\\". But one thing you discover quickly though, is how arrogant the authors are. This is self-evident i suppose, as they're so bold as to call their list of laws as \\"Immutable\\". This is all fine really, but you become aware, as you continue reading, that these laws are anything but unchangable and rock solid. In fact some of the most successful companies today violate some of their so called \\"laws\\", and i believe the authors know this to be true. As you read, these thoughts will be going through your head, but then the author will try and explain away such inconsistencies with falsehoods like \\"Those companies flourish in spite of their choices\\"... yeah right, all of their choices violate the laws, but somehow have grown (not just sustained themselves) after they made them. It also becomes apparent that the book is self-referencing. Need proof of law #15 (randomly chosen for an example) then refer to law #2.   Though, those who read this book now also have the ability of hindsight (book is a few years old now), this truly puts the book to a test as we can see if their predictions are true. When you do this, you see the opposite of what they predicted happened. Predictions have said that some of the biggest companies would have lost an enormous amount of market share, but it didn't happen. One example is Amazon.com, which subscribes to sub-branding, megabrand, extending its product line (line extension), and a few other violations of the \\"immutable laws\\", but amazon has grown quite a bit and their brand has never been stronger. Another example that is quite laughable is the prediction in the internet branding half, where it predicts that the place for search engines is coming to an end and that customers will focus purely on brands and navigate directly to their favorite brand sites... boy are they way off. Even worse, they suggest (as part of their first few \\"internet Laws\\") that your offline (comically referred to as \\"outternet\\") and online marketing and branding attempts should be completely separate. Which hopefully most know these days that it should be a unified approach, at least if you want to get the most bang for your buck. Another laughable internet prediction is that the \\"internet will be the first new medium that will not be dominated by advertising...\\" then it goes on as to why, well let me be the first to say they're once again dead wrong. The internet portion is the worst part of this book as it is so full of misinformation its not even funny (ok, maybe a little). The 11 immutable laws of internet branding section seems like it was written by someone who couldn't keep up with technology, but was thrown in with the other 22 laws in order to make it seem current.  The book would even have you believe that product/service quality is less important than the brand. Now, it is true that some of the top brands may not exactly correlate with quality (compared to other top brands), but there is a limit to how little quality a brand can have and still be a good brand. Hence a company should first and foremost concentrate on quality and then creating and maintaining its brand as a secondary function. They also give an example of beer companies who have created many line extensions, and of course the author has an issue with this as it violates their first two laws. But what happens, do the beer companies lose market share and weaken their brand (as their \\"immutable laws state\\")? Not really, the book goes on to explain that instead their efforts are wasted as the market share of the beer companies never really increased that much. This shows that the authors live and think within a vacuum, their own personal bubble if you will, where their focus is only on the \\"brand\\". Sure, the beer companies market share didn't increase much (but also didn't decrease), but is that the only factor in running a business? Perhaps these decisions were more so based around customer satisfaction, or perhaps another important factor in the overall longevity of a company and its brand (though, i forgot, quality and as such customer satisfaction are not priorities for them).  Now, the reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1, is that it does offer as a good introduction to some ideas, and will at least get you thinking in the right direction, but please for the love of god don't take anything it says at face value. Read, dig deeper with your own research, then make your decision.

030746363X|2.0|review readers should be aware that the vast majority of the reviews here are from already established big fans of Ferris and, as such, are part of Ferris' master-genius plan to drive this, his new book, to the number one position on the Amazon best seller list.  which he has accomplished.  and good for him, i guess.<br /><br />but, really, the book itself is mostly hype and long-winded verbiage expressing not much by the time it's all over.  the first 1/4 is okay, with a lively rehashing of low-carb diets taking on new life as one of his own devising, and the exercise stuff is okay.  but the rest of the book -- ie the remaining 3/4 of the book -- reads like blog post after blog post after blog post -- i.e. padding, and lots of it.<br /><br />yetch.<br /><br />ymmv, obviously.
0060936223|4.0|I found the book delightful; I enjoyed the persona Ms. Smith offered as herself; I appreciated the gentle tone in which she depicted the New York scene and her and Robert Mapplethorpe's complex relationship.    With those wonderful things said (and all quite deserving to be said), I'll shake my head gently at the clear conflict in the Scene's values. The pursuit of artistic integrity does not couple well with with passions regarding appearance and fame. A residue of the Warhol style, which tends to reduce life to performance art, helped propel too many of Smith's friends and acquaintances to early deaths. I was more than pleased that, in this memoir, Smith so fully embraced both love and life itself. That made the book more than worth reading.
B00428CPUY|4.0|Turn up the part with Doyle Bramhall; that is a visceral experience one has got to feel as well as hear.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|I haven't ever written a review on Amazon but feel compelled to do so for Teen Dream, which I bought on a whim last week and have been playing constantly ever since.      I read something about Beach House on Pitchfork almost a year ago when this album came out, downloaded \\"Zebra\\" for free off their website, and went on with my life...at that time really digging Television, Dylan, etc.  I wasn't blown away by Zebra and wasn't even sure if the vocalist was a guy or a girl...    All this seems silly now considering my unapologetic awe at the cohesiveness, beauty, and emotion of this album.  Also considering I have a serious crush on Victoria Legrand, the vocalist.  In an age where CDs are old fashioned and even the album, regardless of listening format, seems dated, I found an incredible satisfaction with popping this CD into my stereo and listening to it all the way through.  Multiple times.  And although it's called Teen Dream, don't let the title fool you - this is not Katy Perry-style hooks.  It's sonically beautiful, complex, and impressively mature.      The highlight for me is \\"10 mile stereo,\\" which has an amazing drum progression and is a major vocal accomplishment.  \\"Walk in the park\\" is also a great track, considering the subject matter of wanting to forget someone that was once important to you.  I always read about great albums to listen to in a particular moment - whether you're getting it on, driving alone, breaking up, etc.  I think one of the strong points of this album is that the cryptic lyrics and \\"dreamy\\" atmosphere appeal to different people in different ways.  It's perfect for a great many occasions.  It's accessible but authentic.  It's emotional but efficient.    As far as criticisms, I will say it is true that the lyrics seem a bit hollow on paper - they require Ms. Legrand's voice to take on their meaning.  Also, the DVD doesn't add much.  Listen to the CD and put your own visuals to the songs - it's not very hard to do.  In conclusion, I give this album my highest praises and hope you will give it a listen - it's the type of quality music that will actually make your life more interesting.

She has is all over Tina Turner when it comes to her song selections and her dynamism on stage.    This CD showcases her covering some fabulous British tunes.  Buy it.  Gift it.  Do both!
B0002TKFRM|5.0|This is a great 3-channel remaster of the great piece into SACD.  With this 'Pictures at an Exhabitation', and if you do have a high resolution system (3-channel) is preferable to stereo for this piece (IMHO), you are in for a very pleasant surprise.  Enjoy the good listen.
159102594X|5.0|We all know the common cliche's in a fantasy book. The usual character developments. The usual good guys and bad guys.     In this book, it is not so. \\"The Blade Itself\\" is an incredible work. The characters are complex, with different emotions, and not just one sense of heroism or one sense of evil. Throughout the book (and the series) there tends to be one character and group of people that are the quintessential \\"bad guy\\". But at different instances within the book itself, the main characters are good or bad, are moral or amoral, or are cruel or merciful. This is partly what makes the series so good, aside from the vividly detailed environments, scenes and impeccable fight scenes. The characters are not what you'd expect, and it makes the book less predictable, while it is not so utterly unpredictable that you cannot follow it, or understand it.     Again, the fight scenes are also incredible, and I never would've thought I would say that about a book, but Mr Abercrombie has changed that for me.     All in all, I would fully recommend this, book, however with the warning that 1. It is r-rated and the rest of the series even more so and 2. it will probably make you spend more money to buy the rest of the series
B0019MQBJW|5.0|You are in for a real treat if you have blue ray, a good sound system and love ballet.

B003ITZBVI|5.0|If you are a fan of Batman, you'll love this movie. Point blank. This is an excellent story, a very dark movie, and the animation is top notch. Voice acting is great even without the voices we've grown to love (Conroy as Batman and Hamill as Joker) it is still awesome. The actors for both Batman and Joker were top notch. The Joker is dark, menacing, and has some hilarious lines. I thoroughly enjoyed ever second of this! A must own.
0802798225|5.0|well minus the musical and Brittany isn't the sister of a rival gang. I was a little put off by Brittany in the beginning, I don't care for fake, 'perfect', stuck up characters. Until I learned her life is far from perfect, the bond with her sister is touching, and right there shows the real Brittany. Then there's Alex, the bad boy gang member. His gang life is so in depth and brought to life. I loved how his culture was such a big part of his story! The connection between both characters is amazing. I laughed, and I got tears in my eyes. I absolutely loved it!<br />I'm not a huge fan of books that alternate characters. But Simone does it successfully!
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|It is hard to find a movie, classic or otherwise that follows the original book/script. The artwork and characterization was stunning. I always look forward to the Seasons Messages through this dynamic story, it truely sets the mood for the rest of the year. It all comes together, the scenery, music and message with modern day technology. I was apprehensive when I first heard it came out, now I want to enjoy it all year long.

B00000JMOF|5.0|I grew up on this and loved it.  We used to mimic the monster, from his cries to his stalking awkward walk.  Having watched it for the first time in 35 years, I must say that it is still one of the greatest horror films ever made.  You get a \\"scientific\\" explanation, a wonderfully creepy monster, and potential for sequels.  Indeed, I enjoyed it so much that I watched many versions, eventually to read the original, which I found astoundingly sophisticated and nuanced.<br /><br />In this, rather than an intelligent creature that could learn, you get a purely brutish monster.  He even got a \\"criminal brain\\" due to Fritz' panic, determining his course in the crudest of ways. This is vintage sci-fi horror, not a morality tale.  The original monster in the novel taught himself to read (Goethe!) and came to his rage out of despair at man's inhumanity and loneliness - he was an innocent who became a monster from experience.  In this, the monster is not very interesting beyond his ability to frighten and rampage.<br /><br />Still, it definitely works.  Perhaps it is too crude for my kids, but I am delighted that this is in my film library.
B002ZG980U|3.0|There are movies and then there are movies within movies....<br /><br />Please. Don't try to make this movie out to be more than it is. A vehicle for some outstanding special effects and an interesting two dimensional tale that requires some fast and fancy footwork to keep your attention.<br /><br />It is like time travel movies. If you think about them too long they loss the appeal. Take it on its surface and have some fun.<br /><br />Cotton candy served in a five star restaurant. Still fluff no matter where it is presented.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|When I heard this book was coming out, I was afraid that I would be disappointed with it and that it wouldn't even compare to the original Percy Jackson series. I was wrong. This book was great-it brought back the characters we love, and also gives us new charcters to get to know. It's full of action, with some humor and romance mixed in. This book really helped me to get back into the world Percy Jackson, and it takes the story even further. I could hardly put this book down, and I am dying for the next installment! Bravo, Rick Riordan, for writing a sequel so enthralling! The Lost Hero is a must-read for all Percy Jackson lovers!
0452284392|5.0|A good introduction to complexity and networks. I would include this in a list of several books to read, including Steven Strogatz's Sync, Duncan Watts' Six Degrees, Melanie Mitchell's Complexity, Mark Buchanan's Nexus, Mitchell Waldrop's Complexity, among others. I appreciated the literary link to Karinthy. Each book of this genre gives unique insights, especially into the author's own research. If at all possible, read several. This book is a good place to start.
0307120007|2.0|This was not what I expected--so be sure you check out the size (5 1/2 inches tall).  I've checked out a version of \\"Pat the Bunny\\" from the library that was bigger...and I think it included more pages.  This must be a scaled-down a cheapened copy.  It's just cardstock on a plastic spine.  Definitely not one you can let a toddler read on their own.  I think my baby will like it...I'll just have to be with her when we read it and be careful!

0061353248|5.0|This book explores the very complex ways in which humans think about personal vs. professional relationships, and about cheating, and about buying things.  The author states right at the beginning, in the very title of the book, that we are irrational, and then goes on to run experiments that exhibit this irrationality.    I found the author's experiments fascinating.  I really enjoyed reading about an experiment, then reading how the author tweaked it just a bit to find out one more bit of information, then often tweaked it a third time in order to tease out one more aspect of behavior.  It was interesting to read about the results of these studies, and to think about where I might fit into the research group with my own behavior.
B001F0WXY0|1.0|I have climbed out of bed to write this for you, because I can take it no longer. Whoever made the kindle version should be fired. The book itself is great. However, random missing spaces, extra spaces, italics that begin or end when they shouldn't, mis-spellings of stillsuit as \\"stulsuit\\"....Please, buy another version. This is an embarrassment to e-publishing....and you'd think with it being on the computer it'd be easier to check for errors. Guess not.<br /><br />Look elsewhere for your ebook copy of Dune.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I know that Band of Brothers is not new... the series aired on HBO a while ago and has been on cable TV during different times of the year since then. But this series is a great picture at how war was.<br />We are actively fighting the War on Terror on two fronts- Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. cringes at two soldiers dying in a single day... Watch Band of Brothers and you'll see that WWII soldiers died at an exponential rate according to today's standards.<br />We as a society no longer have the stomach, nerves or courage to face a war like World War II.<br />Mind you our service men and women do, but we as a nation can't hack it. We complain when a military campaign isn't instantly successful, but then we tell the Commanding Officers when and how they can engage the enemy.<br />During World War II you see a united America willing to let the military do what they do best on the field of battle. The U.S. backed the troops 100% with support back home and the necessary enabling rules of engagement for the front line soldiers to do what needed to be done to end an evil campaign.<br />It wasn't easy. Soldiers died and so did civilians, but lives were saved too. As you see at the end of the BoB series, the lives saved were ones that common people who lived nearby were \\"ignoring\\" or thought were \\"worthless.\\"<br />The men and women in the field did what needed to be done to win and be the heroes we as a nation knew they were... and are today.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining shows that television has to offer. It gives you the value of a story mixed with the \\"supernatural\\" and comedy. It has its horror aspects, yet TV friendly. I watched this show from the first episode and have turned many people on to it. Great show, great adventure, great escape and just plain fun.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|This was received in the best condition. Plays great, and I am very happy with it. I may order another for my daughter who borrowed it and loves it too...or another one for me since she borrowed mine :o)  Thank you for a great product.[[ASIN:B001UW58YK Caught In The Act [Blu-ray]]]
0064410935|5.0|No matter how many times I read this book, I always cry at the end. The lessons of beautiful, enduring friendship are encapsulated in wonderful prose. the characters are lively - \\"3 dimensional\\" - the settings are recognizable, the problems believable. this book can be enjoyed by everyone- your kids, young adults, grandparents. it speaks grippingly and compellingly to all. if you will buy only one book this year, this must be it!
B002AT8KB0|4.0|The Dec/81 release of The Road Warrior starring Mel Gibson was an instant success;coming off the heels of its predecessor Mad Max,it couldn't have done otherwise.On the surface this film is eye candy for those who delight in violence,mayhem and crash after crash in their films.Underneath it all is a smart film continuing on from Mad Max and fleshing out Max's character and his raison d'etre.It was filmed in an out of the way location in Australia and it took the franchise to a whole new level.<br />The story finds Max traveling the roads alone,fending off the odd attack on his vehicle and looking,always looking,for that precious commodity....gas.He comes upon an auto-gryo(a simple,open-air one seat helicopter)in the middle of nowhere.As he approaches it its' owner jumps out of his hiding place and gets the one up on Max.As he attempts to steal Max's ride his dog(\\"dog\\")jumps out of the car and pins him down.The gyro captain(Bruce Spence) tells Max of a fuel refining station not too far away where he can get all the gas he needs.Max and his now captive(the gyro captain)come to a large hill overlooking the refinery and they witness a large gang of desert marauders trying to gain entrance and ultimate control of the refinery,which is heavily guarded by a rogue band of individuals.The leader of the marauders is a fierce some looking,though articulate,individual wearing a Jason-like mask called Lord Humungus(Kjell Nilson),while his first lieutenant is a mohawk-headed \\"dog of war\\" called Wez(Vernon Wells);Max and the harassed populace will have many frighteningly close encounters with the latter.At this time some of the guardians of the refinery seem to be trying to make a break out but it is all for naught.Max and the gyro captain watch in horror as a couple are hunted down;the man fatally shot and the woman gang raped and shot.When the marauders leave Max sees his chance for more gas and arrives on the scene.The man is barely alive and offers Max all the gas he can carry if he can get him back to the safety of the refinery.<br />Max delivers on his promise but the man he \\"saved\\" dies and the people there do not trust him.Lord Humungus offers the settlers their freedom and lives if they will just walk away from the refinery.As they discuss the pros and cons Max offers to go back to a rig he found earlier the day before and drive it back so the settlers can take out their large tanker of fuel that they guard.The deal is struck and Max and \\"dog\\" walk back carrying full jerry cans,followed by a young boy about eight years old,named the \\"feral boy\\"(Emil Minty),who wields a deadly steel boomerang and becomes quite attached to Max.Along the way they meet up with the poor gyro captain who is dragging a stump Max left him chained to.Max of course loads up the hapless captain with the jerry cans,and eventually they arrive at their destination.<br />It is now daylight and Max knows this is going to be a suicide run back to the refinery,having to go through the marauders territory.Undaunted he sets off along with the aide of the captain piloting his gyro-copter.Through a harrowing ride Max makes it into the compound followed by some of the marauders including Wex.After an intense struggle they are all killed or driven out.The truck is not in good shape and it will take about 12 hours to fix.The settlers ask Max to stay and drive the rig out with them but he refuses,insisting he has fulfilled his end of the bargain and just wants to go.This he does next day but not far out from the compound he is jumped by the marauders who take him down.He is thrown from his overturned vehicle and in bad shape.\\"Dog\\" dies defending him while a few moments later his car blows up killing two marauders.The rest leave thinking there is no one left alive.Just as Max faints he sees the gyro captain coming in for a landing near him.Next thing he knows he is back at the refinery.The settlers have voted to leave and this is when Max gets involved in the fight and volunteers to ride the rig full of fuel.<br />At the appointed time Max leaves in his rig(with the feral kid aboard),while the settlers leave in another direction.The marauders all head for the fuel tanker,as was the plan.The refinery is now open and undefended and the few who go in to take it over are blown to bits when a deliberately timed explosion occurs destroying everything with it.Max in the meantime is harassed every foot of highway he rides.All the settlers who come along to guard the tanker are killed.In a fiery explosion both Humungus and Wez are killed at the same time.However Max cannot outrun all of them and his tanker is flipped over spilling its' precious contents.The remaining marauders turn and drive away as we see Max crawling out from the drivers cab.As the gyro captain comes along Max looks at the spilling \\"fuel\\";it is sand.Max was the decoy and the actual fuel is safely on board the buses the other settlers traveled in!<br />The movie fades out as the narrator of the film(in actuality the feral boy now grown up;the film being his reminisces)tells us that this is the last he saw of Max.The last shot is of Max standing sideways in the fading light on the highway,camera pulling back...and fade out.<br />The Road warrior left a huge impression at the time of its release and still impresses today.Well directed with fleshed out characters,interesting scenes and stunts to die for.The stunt work in this movie is still to this day studied very closely by stunt schools worldwide.The film plunked Max firmly down into the dystopian world we knew from Mad Max and gave him a richer canvass on which to \\"paint\\".Characters liked Humugus and Wez and their interaction with their fellow marauders and Max,gave a good part of this film its life.Also Bruce Spence as the gyro captain gave the film a bit of comedy relief at crucial times,playing his part brilliantly.Of course the Wachowsky brothers when they made their classic \\"Matrix\\" movies,didn't forget The Road Warrior and especially Bruce Spence,and put him into the memorable role of The Trainman.<br

1439152780|5.0|I was quite fascinated with this book even given its length.  It's not the type of book you can just blow through. The author spends a lot of time with character development and you will do yourself a huge disservice if you don't take your time with it.  I found the writing beautiful and the storyline enchanting.  The physical descriptions of the castle made me feel as though I could close my eyes and reach out and touch the moldering walls.  I did feel a bit of disconnect between the relevancy of Edie's mother and her relationship to the main story.  I suppose it was the \\"open door\\" to bringing the reader into the castle in the first place.  The next book I want to read by Kate Morton is The Forgotten Garden. She has an uncanny ability to transport her readers to a different place and time.  I am eager to see if she can perform her magic in that one as well.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I purchased this book after my daughter recommended it.  I originally had the sample sent to my Kindle, buy had to buy the book and read the rest of the story.  The story is very touching.  I loved the way the author drew you into not only today's world, but also that of 30 years ago and 100 years ago and made each era interesting and appealing.  I'm usually one for mystery novels.  This story is a mystery novel, but so much more.  It chronicles 4 generations and makes you love each one more than the last.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the original LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, so I fully expected LET ME IN to be bloody awful. Fortunately, I can report that this film is one of the best remakes I've ever seen! The reason is that they kept the heart of the story in tact, while making slight changes here and there, resulting in a low-key reboot that simply brings the wonderful tale to a wider audience. The success of this movie rests solely on the shoulders of the principle characters (played by Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi-Smit McPhee). These two recapture the same magic / chemistry that made the original so special. I can now watch both versions with a sigh of great relief...
B002ZG98LO|4.0|Best part about the movie is that they followed the gritty feeling of the other 2 Predator movies. You get a good sci-fi action movie that was made for mature audiences and adds some little nuggets of information on Predators as a species.     All in all, it follows well in the foot steps of the previous movies and should really be a hit with fans and newbies to the franchise as a whole. Nothing really to let you down in my opinion. Unlike the 2 AVP flicks...and Alien Resurrection for that matter.
B0042RUMEQ|2.0|I'm not a big Nicki Minaj fan but I liked hearing her on other peoples albums. I do not like this album at all. There are a few songs I like. She sounds better on other peoples songs!
B003L20IJM|4.0|Nanny McPhee's working credo goes like this: \\"When you need me but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me but no longer need me, then I have to go.\\" Except who would want to gaze at Nanny McPhee, perhaps the universe's ugliest deus ex machina? But there is implication to her homeliness, a meaning to her monobrow and hairy warts and snaggletooth.<br /><br />The story is set in rural England, somewhen in the early '40s. On a muddy, poo-ridden farmhouse, harried young mother Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) struggles to raise her three boisterous children, with her husband gone off to fight in the big war. The tipping point arrives in the span of one day, in the shape of her very difficult niece and nephew come to stay on the farm while London is being bombed. Her kids and their cousins promptly commence a feud. As a cherry on top, in slinks her worthless brother-in-law (Rhys Ifans), waving his unwanted paperwork, trying to convince Mrs. Green to sell the farm, mostly so that he could pay off his gambling debts. The evening having gone all blustery and ominous, Mrs. Green, at her wits' end, responds to a knock on her door and glimpses on her doorstep the unsightly governess Nanny McPhee, there to impart five important lessons on the children. The lightning flashing in the background accentuates Nanny McPhee's gross unbecoming features. When Mrs. Green insists that she doesn't need help, Nanny McPhee states formally: \\"I am an Army nanny, Mrs. Green. I have been... deployed.\\" In a wartime era, that's enough to sway a person.<br /><br />Emma Thompson writes the screenplay and demonstrates again that she's got her finger on the pulse of what makes a fantasy family picture work. NANNY MCPHEE RETURNS is enchanting and whimsical and quite funny. And, amidst the synchronized-swimming pigs and belching jackdaws and lady heavies and perhaps the most fun defusing of a bomb ever, we're treated to some very good dramatic beats which lend depth and ground the fable. If you've seen the first movie, Maggie Smith discloses a neat, unexpected bit of continuity near the end of the movie.<br /><br />Only tell me that Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal are sharing camera time, and it's enough to inform me of that film's quality. In the Maggie Gyllenhaal Can Do No Wrong Department, Maggie affects a pretty darn convincing English accent, and she's wonderful, as expected. You soon enough warm up to the alarming magical Nanny McPhee, especially as it's neat to see one of her facial flaws vanish each time the children learn a lesson. The children, who tend to make or break movies like this, are fairly terrific. That reprobate Uncle Phil, you won't recognize him as such, but actor Rhys Ifans is the same bloke who played Hugh Grant's odd flat mate in NOTTING HILL. Also, Ralph Fiennes cameos in one of those scenes that simply elevates the film as a whole.<br /><br />Mary Poppins who?<br /><br />No, I take that back. I still love Mary Poppins. But is it me or doesn't Nanny McPhee come across as an ultimately warmer character than Mary Poppins?<br /><br />The DVD's bonus features: Director Susanna White's audio commentary; 12 deleted scenes with introductory captions (totaling 00:15:03 minutes); two featurettes \\"A Look Inside\\" (00:02:38) and \\"New Film, New Story\\" (00:04:09) give behind-the-scenes peeks at the film; \\"Magical Moves\\" - about the sequence in which the children are bewitched into punishing themselves for fighting (00:01:53); \\"Mr. Edelweiss\\" - spotlight on the magical belching jackdaw bird that's hooked on window putty (00:02:04); \\"Emma Thompson Becomes Nanny McPhee\\" - the arduous make-up process, from start to finish, shown thru time-lapse (00:01:39); \\"The Pigs\\" featurette - believe it or not, some CG was involved in the piglet sequences (00:03:42); and \\"The Mud\\" featurette - yes, the cast & crew talk about the mud in the film (00:02:04).ou've seen the first movie, Maggie Smith discloses a neat, unexpected bit of continuity near the end of the movie.<br /><br />Only tell me that Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal are sharing camera time, and it's enough to inform me of that film's quality.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I love Evangelion and have loved it since i first saw it 13-14 years ago.    BUT they left the original intro off the Blu-Ray ... I actually Really missed this.  (Im glad I kept my DVD versions)
0525421580|5.0|1: There are NO animal-morphing, super-powered teenagers. That go to a \\"special\\" Academy.  2: There are NO dead siblings/parents to mourn over. That were accidentally killed by the main character.  3: There are NO stupid/bad parents. Or parents discovered to have been NOT the parents.  4: There ARE lots of real feelings and a proportionate amount of difficulties understanding them. By the characters.  5: There IS fantastic dialog - the script device works.  6: There IS abundant great humor and also very real pain.  7: There is FABULOUS hopefulness and love. And a really great musical that should be produced.  8: This book can and should be enjoyed by so-called adults. Like me.

030746363X|1.0|Others have commented on the content and I agree with those who noted that there is nothing particularly new here, although it is mildly interesting.  If you've ever done Atkins post-induction, especially with added keto cyling, the diet part will look very familiar.  The writing style is also all over the place, difficult to follow and has advice inconsistent with itself in many spots.  He spends way too many chapters trying to convince you that he is worth listening to, instead of just getting to the point.  There is much more of the former than actual content.  He also tries to cover way too many unrelated random subjects in one book and does none of them very well.  I recommend getting a book on whichever of these subjects interests you, as the advice is already out there and with better writing.  The rambling gets much worse to tolerate on a kindle, as the pages are often out of order, and there is no table of contents or index to skip around with.  For a book like this intended as a reference, and where the author advises skipping around to sections of interest, it would have been nice if they put a little effort into the kindle edition to make that possible.  If you are still intrigued enough to buy, get the book on paper to save frustration.
0757302661|5.0|this book was gold to me in my preparation for having a baby naturally with no medication. I loved the exercises in the book to teach me how to relax. Along with the preparation, it really connected my husband and I. I used this on my 3rd baby and he felt more involved than ever. It really works. Mind power is the best. Now I have ordered it for my little sister who is expecting her first. I think every pregnant woman should read this.  Not only does it help you with preparation for birth but also helps understand the history of child birth and how it has evolved over the years.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Great action packed movie, Angelina is believable as an action star.  Truly smart and well made movie, if it seemed confusing to some people   it's simply because of their stupidity, because everything was very well explained.
B001DHXT1G|2.0|Ok... bought this BD of the hulk a long time ago as i'm a big fan of the hulk. wanted a BD copy for my collection and i guess it doesn't help to procrastinate because I finally watched it and 3/4 through the movie, it begins freezing and won't go any further.  can't return it now because it's been waaaaay past the return time and so i'm just kind of stuck with an almost working BD. oh well.... i guess it is what it is.  next time for sure though, will put it in right away but you live and you learn.
B00275EHJG|3.0|Altough it says on the back cover that it contains a french version, dubbed in Quebec, this DVD only contains the english version.
1439181780|5.0|If you keep one book by your bedside, this is it. It is a book that, once you've read it one time through, you can flip to any page at anytime, and be inspired, comforted, excited, grateful. I did enjoy The Secret very much, but this book is much better - the concepts are applicable to everyday, no matter what your circumstances. Since reading this book, I look at my relationships with myself and others differently - lovingly - and I can honestly say all those relationships have improved. For that reason alone, buy this book. Of course, applying the law of attraction can bring you material goods, and I am working on that aspect of the book (and having success!), but the main point I took away is how love and gratitude work wonders in one's life. Enjoy!
B003ELOQD4|5.0|U2 thank you for such a excellent christmas present. As we missed the live show in Vienna this summer - thanks to wideworldticketstore.com...:-( - this video is a small satisfaction. And I can say it is one of the best concert video I have ever seen.

This is a great accessory, it takes some time to get use to it, but once you do you'll end up buying this triggers for every controller you have.  Is not that you're going to improve your gaming by having them, but they definitely make your controller to be more comfortable.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|Wow!  This box is awesome.  I was leery of buying it because of the bad reviews, but now that I've listened to the CDs, watched the DVD, and read the book, I think it's a great slice of rock history.  The music, of course, kicks butt--B.B. and Ike and Tina, as well as the Stones.  The DVD footage conveys a great feel for the times and the people of 1969, as do the writings and photos in the book.  (And the card of Mick in touch with his feminine side is hilarious!)  For $40 at Amazon, I think it's money well spent.  Maybe the CDs could have contained the complete shows, maybe the DVD could have been longer, maybe this, maybe that.  But it's cool as it is.  As they said, you can't always get what you want--but it's sweet to want what you get.

0805091742|5.0|Every weekday morning after I wake up to my cell phone alarm, I complete 36 or so tasks before driving my car to work.  I consider 12 of these tasks to be critical, e.g. put money clip in back pocket (yes, all wise guys carry a money clip), put reading glasses in cover and in laptop bag.  One particular task is mission critical.  If I forget to take my laptop to work (has happened a few times over the years), I'd have to drive back home from work to get it.  The rest I can improvise.  If I forget my watch, I'll check the time on my cell phone or laptop.  If I forget my cell phone, I'll call people using my work phone.  If I forget my money clip, I'll borrow cash from coworkers.  Last Monday morning, I forgot to put the trash out; a rarety.  So I gave my mom and sister a full trash bag each time they visited during that week.  The following Monday night, I put the remainder trash overflow in my neighbors' trash bins where there was excess capacity.      I've been going through this routine for years, and consider myself a \\"super specialist\\" at carrying them out.  Yet, I consistently fail at 1-2 of the 12 critical tasks once or twice a week.  After years of what feels like groundhog day (the movie), I should be able to sleep walk through these 36 mundane tasks.  I fail because I'm under a time pressure, and the tasks are too many for an hour of allotted time (shower, shave, iron shirt are just 3 of the 36).  So there is a level of complexity from the sheer number of them. According to Mr. Gawande, a check list of the 12 critical tasks can be of substantial help.  This check list is short (12 of 36), and should contain the tasks that are prone to memory lapse with a history.  I will not include \\"eat breakfast\\" to this list, because unless I suffer from Alzheimers, I will never fail to perform this step.    Now, should I really create a check list to remember to put my sneakers in my trunk along with the rest of my gym attire (when I forget this task, I have to skip working out at the gym on that day)?  Not really.  But imagine if failure at any of these tasks means putting someone's or hundreds of people's lives in danger.  The stakes are that high in the surgical and airline pilot professions, with mind boggling complexity.  Mr. Gawande, himself a highly esteemed general surgeon discusses case studies demonstrating consequences of inconceivable failures at the highest professional levels in a multitude of industries, and how a simple idea such as a checklist has proven undeniably that critical failures can be reduced significantly.  It is unfortunate that resistance to this idea is rampant.  From page 173 of the hardcopy, \\"We don't like checklists.  They can be painstaking... But I don't think the issue here is mere laziness.  There's something deeper, more visceral going on when people walk away, not only from saving lives but from making money.  It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an embarrassment.  It runs counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly great among us - those we aspire to be - handle situations of high stakes and complexity.  The truly great are daring.  They improvise.\\" Adapt to the environment, Darwin, expletive happens, I Ching, whatever man, we gotta roll with it (appropriate and timely \\"Collateral\\" Tom Cruise quote inserted).  \\"They do not have protocols and checklists.\\"    The checklist is a brilliant and simple idea that is picking up steam thanks to the efforts of Mr. Gawande and those like him.  This book should be mandatory reading in colleges and professions with serious health consequences.

0891419195|5.0|This is a personal account of the harrowing and brutal fighting and horror these brave men faced and hand-to-hand fighting seemingly without parallel in the annals of U.S. warfare.<br /><br />These are the unrelenting, earth shattering and macabre experiences that show how their love for each other did as much for their perseverence as any training or experience ever did. Courage beyond belief, and tragedy without let up until literally the last volleys were expended, and the last Japs and Marines, dead.<br /><br />They lived with death, dying and destruction, artillery noise that shattered eardrums,unthinkable wounds, concussions, shattered bodies hanging in trees, screaming and insanity often minute by minute hour by hour day by day and sometimes, week by week...without letup. Add to those elements, dysentery, pneumonia, walking wounded, the physically and mentally missing...get the picture?<br /><br />AND YET, THEY WERE VICTORIOUS WITHOUT EXCEPTION!<br /><br />Read these old breeds then ask yourself, \\"Could I ever begin to muster up to what it takes to wear the Eagle Globe and Anchor\\"? Their grandsons are today guarding what we all should be so grateful for here, as they continue to spill their blood in the mountains, marshes and deserts of Afghanistan and Iraq.
1591840562|3.0|This book is a great mini bible for anyone willing to start a business. It is short enough to not bore you, and long enough to cover all the basics.     Sometimes tips provided in the book seem logical and common sense really. The value is having all the good practices brilliantly bound together in a logical sequence of chapters. The book style is also very concise and inspiring. This is a great first book to read before branching out to specific areas of interests in the startup world.     My only reserve, however, concerns the fact that the book start with a very high energy and informative passages, and then it loses some of the punch as you go through the chapters. Also some of the Tables add very little value to the book .......  I was also a somewhat disappointed to not see examples about how modern startups solved some of the issues talked about in the successive chapters. All you read is how Apple made it a couple of decades ago. I was expecting more real-life examples of some of the companies the author invested in as part of his VC activities.    It is still a great positive book that motivates you from the start to the end.

The story threads were a mess that never really came together.  The parts that could have been interesting were missing.  Developing the main character would have been appreciated.  The ending read like an afterthought as though the deadline were approaching.  Waste of time and energy reading it.

B003YUC2FE|2.0|My son got this for Christmas from his grandparents and although we are extremely grateful and the price on this is great, the way the discs are packaged is terrible. As others have stated, they do not come in individual cases or even slip cases, they are just positioned in a foam block. It is really difficult for my son to properly put them away himself, so I am worried that over time they will get left out and scratched.     Be aware that if you want to keep them well protected, you will want to purchase jewel cases or at least sleeves separately. The foam block CAN be removed and the discs stored in jewel cases inside the toy box, which is what I'm guessing we'll end up doing.    Can't complain about the price though, and it only took me about 5 minutes to get all the digital copies loaded into iTunes and onto the ipod, which is great.
B003VS0CWO|4.0|Love Love Love this movie....unfortunately we are unable to watch it on the new Blu-Ray version we bought.  The disc will not play.  So looked for advice...said I needed to update the firmware on my blu ray player....so I did.....unfortunately did not correct the problem.  So sad we love this movie and were all settled in for a night of fun watching...alas did not happen.
0143118420|3.0|I like Elizabeth Gilbert's writing style. She has a dry and self-effacing sense of humor and is someone I'd probably really like to chat with over a glass of wine. I enjoyed Eat, Pray, Love, but some of it was a bit thick. The Eat and Love sections were my favorites. Yes, she does do a bit more wallowing in her book than I would like, but really that's what it's all about.  It's probably very difficult to write a story of a spirtual and self-realization journey without some wallowing. All in all, she handles it well, and some of the wallowing was pretty humorous.  And I could also find myself thinking \\"been there\\" at times.
0385528752|1.0|This book is nothing more than a collection of heart felt stories followed by the lesson the story teaches. It's a storybook for people with short attention spans.  Here's the formula: (1) Tell an inspirational story of people overcoming insurmountable problems. (2) Tell the \\"Moral of the story\\" in case the reader couldn't connect the dots. (3) Create warm and fuzzy feeling in the reader by repeating the lessons of the story. (4) Isn't life grand? Anything is possible! (5) Proceed to next inspirational story.  Yada yada yada...<br /><br />The 2 kids who assembled this collection of stories should be charged with a crime for charging money for this pablum.
B00005LOUP|4.0|Christmas classic; Share with everyone the true meaning of Holiday spirit with the fun creatures of Who-Ville. This is a holiday must-watch! Jim Carey plays The Grinch hilariously and determined. Remember that it only takes one good heart to keep the spirit alive! Disc arrived in original packaging, great film!
B000F8O35U|5.0|I had to purchase a used Ariel movie because I couldn't find a new one. Disney is always with the ridiculous idea to hide the movies in a \\"vault\\", so everyone has to go crazy and try to find it by all means necessary. The movie was in good condition and that was really good. I was a little afraid about that.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Awesome movie :) Batman is amazing as always, Heath Ledgers final performance couldn't be any more amazing, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. Disc arrived brand new, still in plastic packaging. Awesome!
0385732554|5.0|The Giver, recipient of the 1994 Newberry Medal, and considered by the American Library Association as one of the \\"100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000\\".<br />The book is about a teen boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect community, a community that is sheltered from the world. In this community everyone has a special job; a job the council appoints them. The day called the Ceremony of Twelve. Jonas is 11 and his day to get his job is coming soon. He has no idea what his job will be. At the ceremony, he is called last. At the end, he finds out he's chosen to be the Receiver. The next day, Jonas meets his trainer, the old Receiver.<br />Receivers \\"receive\\" memory from each other, and from generations of receivers past. With these memories, the Receiver gives advice to the council in making important decisions.<br />Jonas is shocked by the memories, he feels and sees things he hasn't seen. He even feels pain, which he's never felt. He also learns of the startling truths in his community, which makes him want to escape, and he comes up with a plan to escape; a plan that could get him killed.<br />The narration is told in third person. It will remind many readers of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and George Orwell's 1985 in the way that it deals with society, censorship, etc.<br />Lowry uses simple language (unlike Fahrenheit 451) but it also could be the book's downfall if you like more expressive writers such as Michael Moorcock and Terry Brooks.<br />The thing I enjoyed most about the book was the plot, especially when Jonas learns the dark secrets of what his community does behind everyone's back. I hope this book will give you the same suspense and chills as it gave me.
0545265355|5.0|I purchased this book set for around $30 cheaper than the BAMM price! It was a gift for my daughter.  It arrived on time and in new condition as promised!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Avid fan of The Big Bang Theory. Season 2 was wonderful season with non stop comedy in each episode. Highly recommended
B0043VCPW8|5.0|Rarely do artists really understand the desire of fans to hear demos, alternate and live versions of their hits. Bryan Adams has given his fans a true gem in this album.  This raw live acoustic album is a must have. His amazing voice, the acoustic guitar and piano combined with the energy of the audiences to produce a very good quality live album.  If you love the Unplugged album from 96, you'll certainly love this album too.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|I had never read the ESV until I used it with Kindle.  I am very happy with it.  For now, it is the best study Bible that Kindle offers.    Relative to the operational restrictions of the Kindle, it offers scriptural accuracy (at least I think so), well-written notes, and online resources.  One note:  originally, I had no success in finding the URLs,sited on the Kindle page, for the charts and maps.  After repeated calls to Amazon support and the ESV customer service, I finally was given an answer:  The letter 'u', in the URL given ([...]) is in a font that does not show a \\"tail.\\"  Therein lay the problem.  It was not a U, but rather a V.  Now, in my defense, I am using the Kindle because my sight has deteriorated.  It is extremely difficult for me to detect tiny differences in tiny font.    I doubt if this is solely my problem....so, the only suggestion I have is to use a font, for exterior resource, that is BIG!
B00192IV9U|5.0|\\"Michael\\" may not be the King of Pop's best album ever nor the most creative title, but it is still an amazing album.  Even using tracks that were not originally ready for prime time like \\"Hold My Hand\\" and \\"The Way You Love\\", the producers did an amazing job.  I have been collecting so called unreleased tracks for a very long time and these finished products are absolutely KING OF POP worthy.  I can't wait to hear what's next!
0525951652|5.0|A wonderfully well-researched and well-written book, as we've come to expect from Ken Follett.  A great history lesson and an absorbing read.  Engaging characters will capture your emotions and imagination. You will end up impatient for volume 2.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|Even with an OS upgrade this blu ray wont play on  my panasonic blu ray machine.  These studios keep tinkering with the format and you never know what will play or not.  Only the sony ps3 is updated enough to keep up. Other machjines watch out! This gets old.

B00275EHJG|3.0|I rented this off netflix and am glad was very disappointed, bad story, no continuity however voice acting was still pretty good.<br />15 years ago I grew up with this stuff and now looking back I still like the first one the best the second was fun but a bit played out this one is proof the story is dead.<br />the funny thing is that now 3 is the highest rated pure and utter nonsense.<br />if you don't care about quality in anything other than cg this would be a 4-5, bottom line rent it if you somehow like it then buy it.
B00006JKON|5.0|All I wanted was a quickly delivered copy of Warchild, one of the few Jethro tull albums I didn't have on CD.  I ordered it, it came quickly, was not damaged or defective, and I was charged the amount I was told I would be charged.  A pleasure.
B003FXXNH6|3.0|this movie uses more wire and speed up effects to make fighting look spectacular than the old HK movies used to.<br />it is also much lower class and acting is non existent.<br />I have seen 100s of hours of fighting this is just action movie bs and not much action either.<br />put a 50+ year old Don Wilson in the ring with any of these posers and you would see a fight.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I have never in my life purchased a set of any SEASON for any TV program.... UNTIL NOW with DEXTER...I love it..........  I caught the first season on TV way back when it started, and then never saw it again (being Canadian and back & forth) until we purchased a TV package that included 3 mos free Showtime and was able to see SEASON 5...  I told my husband he would like it & ordered Season 1 & 2 for my own Christmas Present and now have him hooked also.  We just went out today & purchased Season 3 & 4, and signed up to be notified when Season 5 is ready for sale... The best way I have found to discribe this show to my friends who have not seen it is... \\"It's about a Good, Bad Guy... who rids the earth of creeps who deserve to die, and it makes you wish there really were more people like him\\"    Keep up the great work Michael & others..& hope Michael is able to beat the Leukmia.
0634022296|5.0|My Dad got this for me for Christmas this year (I am a HUGE Beatles fan!) and I have to say I'm enjoying it quite a bit. I'm still a beginner guitar playing, but this book seems easy to follow and I can't wait to get good enough to tackle some of them. I would definitely recommend this for any other Beatles lover.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Product came super fast.  I love this movie and it was an awesome price!     Thanks!
B003R0LBVW|1.0|Okay, maybe I don't have the historic experience with this Mr. Franzen...some comments show they have followed his work. But I was so enchanted by the concept of this book....the bottom line....I could NOT care about one soul painted in this novel. There was a hint of what could be when we learn of the childhoods of the couple, the Berglunds...she was raped, he had an bizarre Dad and lived in a hotel as owners...but the story, in a text that is fairly long and wordsy....heck it just sunk...(sunk, as it fell sooooo short of what it was hyped to be.)<br /><br />I almost feel it was an effort by the author to strut his broad knowledge of a broad variety of crap most people don't care about...or maybe his research into things he has interest in....but there was no story worth the work he must have efforted.<br /><br />I read...tried to fire up some eagernes---maybe the first three chapters I was involved....but just could not get in it; meanwhile, started other books, finished three, and came back thinking it was a mood thing....and no matter, I had to 'work' at reading it. I am somewhat 'shocked' it received the reviews (nevermind Oprah's Book Club's push)....Sad that we fall for this crap!<br /><br />I have now finished...and frankly felt pissed at the end---which was a shrug at best---I would enjoyed cleaning my house instead.<br /><br />Someday I may read \\"The Corrections\\"....but I surely would not just buy it as I did this one!
B000002AHM|2.0|3 phenomenal guitarists, all on acoustic, and all blazing away. In theory it sounds like it should make great listening but, in reality, without experiencing the excitement live by actually being there, this doesn't really work that well.<br /><br />The songs all sound too similar, the lightening fast riffs take a front seat to the actual melodies and you cannot discern who is playing (with the exception of Paco).<br /><br />If you get this because you want to hear virtuosos, then this is effective. If you want to hear good music, you should stick with the studio versions.
031603438X|4.0|The one glaring negative about Mr. Richards book is that he talks so much about drug addiction - it might be as much as 50% of the book's content. I had hoped for more insight about the creative process and his love for guitars but there isn't much there. Perhaps it's a form of therapy that he talks so much about his past drug addiction...
B003102JDM|2.0|I hate this movie because of the ending. It sucks and offers no resolution. The Coen brothers like to do that (see \\"No Country for Old Men\\" which has the worst ending of any movie).<br /><br />I do not know enough about this movie to offer an intellectual review. For instance, I do not know if this was derived from a novel and the Coen brothers simply mirrored the book (which I think they did in \\"No Country\\"). I do know that this film is largely autobiographical reflecting the upbringing of the Coen brothers.<br /><br />I'm Jewish and yet this was too Jewishy for me. If you are not Jewish, don't even waste your time with this. I interpret this as basically a \\"book of Job\\" situation where the main character gets continuosly dumped on. That's what the movie is about...a guy getting abused...from all angles...and then it just ends!<br /><br />Since the movie had such a narrow focus, with no resolution, no climax, and no lessons to be learned... I found the movie to be a waste of time.<br /><br />P.S.  There was one great scene that has an applicability to life. There's a scene where the main character (the guy getting thoroughly abused) is with his cousin and the cousin cries to the main character that he, HE has it so lucky because HE has such a good life. That scene was powerful and a nice illustration of no matter how your life is going you never want to trade your problems for somebody else's problems.
076781214X|5.0|Had no idea that Francis Ford Copploa directed this. Saw it before but really didn't pay attention. A particular fantasy of mine, of lots of people, to go back to our youth, especially high school, and do it better or something. I'm sure this film prompted the Back to the Future Films and others. The old cars, the clothes, kind of an expensive, goofy Hollywood remake of adolescent memories. The lesson: It isn't what we did in the past. It's what we do in the present!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed with this Avatar Blu-ray.  It's incredibly comprehensive.  I couldn't ask for more supplemental material.
B004529NLG|5.0|OK so the story is simplistic. The acting is passable. However, the dancing is just great! And this is what makes the movie.     We just bought a 3D TV and Blu-Ray for Christmas and bought this 3D Blu-Ray the day it came out. Although the use of 3D is gimmicky at times, for the most part it was a great use of the format and some numbers like the \\"Battle of GWAI\\" had us clapping at the end of it, as did the last dance of the Finals (where the dancers were outfitted in LED lit suits). Overall The movie really benefits from being shot in 3D, and before the end credits began running our kids (7 and 9 YO) were out of their bean bag chairs and dancing in their best interpretation of the moves they just saw.     From the other reviews I knew the story was going to be simple, but the message is still there: follow your dreams no matter how improbable they are. Also, the story line was enough to keep me engaged with the characters and give the viewer a breather between dance routines.    For parents with younger viewers be aware that there is one f-bomb, one s**t, and a bull-s**t tossed out. But they come and go so quickly that it is hard to even realize what was said. My 9 YO, who usually picks up on words he has not heard before, didn't in this case. If it was not for the few swear words I am think the movie would have been classified as PG. Yes, there are intense dance \\"battle\\" scenes. But nothing scary or threatening (no knives or weapons). There are also skimpily clad dancers but actually less skimpy that what one would see on prime-time TV ABC's \\"Dancing with the Stars\\". There is fliting between the two main characters for about half the movie and a couple of kissing scenes (\\"Ewww, why did they have to show that\\" said the 7 YO) but nothing more suggestive than that.    A couple of minor quibbles: for some in-explicable reason the 3D Blu-Ray does not have a scene selection option (the 2D Blu-Ray does). Also I am not sure I need the combo-pack. After watching the movie in 3D, 2D just does not compare. And if you have the Blu-Ray (2D and 3D) why would you need the DVD (I guess you can use it in the car). Like I said, just minor quibbles....    All-in-all a great showcase of dance and the 3D Blu-Ray format.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I could not put this book down once I had started it.  I finished it in less than a full day, and it was AMAZING!  I just received my Kindle for Christmas, and now that it is the 26th I am hungry for more books exactly like this one!  It is well organized, well written, and believable.  I love that it was written from Jack's perspective.  Great read!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This is an enjoyable read and I recommend it, but I don't feel it's as amazing as many are making it out to be.  The NY Times listed it as a top 10 book of 2010 - that's pushing it.  The novel centers around a five year old boy and his mother who are held captive in an 11 x 11 foot room.  I will not go any further into plot so as not to spoil it. BEWARE - many reviewers have innapropriately given too much plot detail which may spoil it for you!    I always sample books on my Kindle first, and you see right away that the book is narrated by the child in the diction and syntax of a five year old.  I found this annoying at first, but plowed on because the book was so highly praised.  You get used to it after a while.  Here's the short of it: The book starts out very ambitiously like a good thriller - you're wondering what's going to happen next, but the second half of the book was a letdown.  The story peaks too early and the second half becomes more of a dry character piece and a commentary on society, rather that a continuation of the tight, plot-driven style of the first half.  That's my only real beef.  Having said that, the book was still enjoyable, quite original and I recommend it.  I just don't think it lives up to all the intense praise it has received.  Add another star if you're a mother, because of the mother-son relationship explored throughout the book.
0525951652|2.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth and World without End and couldn't wait for Fall of Giants...great reading for a Kindle. Like the past two, it is rich in character development and the characters come in and out of each other's lives throughout the book. What I found disappointing was the tedium of the exacting military maneuvers. They took up too much valuable space in this 1000+ page book. I know war buffs will be entranced, but people like me, just looking for a great story and rich characters, feel cheated.
B004CEUEWE|3.0|This movie is nice but very, very slow. I thought I missed it when I could not go to the movie theatre but don't it regret after watching it on Amazon VOD.........
B00280LYHS|4.0|I absolutly loved the whole series. I was a little disapointed in this book because the way it ended, but that is my opinion. I do not regret buyimg the series. It is definatly a page turner.
0470913029|5.0|I bought this book because they were out of Robb Wolf's Paleo Solution. I was not disappointed. I started the diet once I had the basics and then adjusted as I got more information. I started without the intent of losing weight, but it started to come off immediately. I dropped from 196.4 to 177.4 in about 40 days (lost mostly fat and probably 10-15% in muscle). I was eating three solid meals a day and doing some fitness (on average less than 30 minutes a day). It took a few weeks to figure out my energy and hunger levels. I love this book and intend to stick with this diet the rest of my life. It is not a fad/starvation/exercise till you die diet. I wish I had learned about this when I was a kid. There are some sacrifices though - you have to cook, you have to shop and you have to explain to everyone about this diet. By the way I am currently reading the Paleo Solution by Robb Wolf and recommend that book as well.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|The Pacific is definitely no Band of Brothers, but it is still a good series.  Cinematically, it is excellent but the numerous historical inaccuracies really bring it down.  After watching the series I read two of the books on which the series is based--With the Old Breed by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie.  The series does not hold true to either of the books, and they really just seemed to pick out the parts that they liked to create their own story.  I understand that they have to change some things and shorten some stories for the sake of time, but some of the parts that they changed just seemed pointless to me, and some of the details they messed up were pretty important.  I honestly have no idea why they changed so much, maybe they thought the changes would make a better story?  Either way, I was really disappointed in the lack of accuracy especially coming from the guys who made Band of Brothers.  Had they kept the series accurate for the most part, it would get an easy five stars.  However, I think they still did a good job of portraying Marines in the Pacific Theatre and the battle scenes are excellent.
006621131X|5.0|I knew Patti Smith was a rocker, but I couldn't tell you about her music. Nothing against her personally, but the music scene in general has escaped me, as well as the art scene. All featured prominently in her rise in the late 60's/early 70's New York City, and in her book \\"Just Kids\\", which was why she wasn't on my radar. However, the crux of the story lies in her relationship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, and in it, Smith spins a sweet poem of a story that brings to life this name, this icon, and what a read it is.<br /><br />Smith finds herself arriving in NYC without a penny to her name, and a starched waitress uniform in her suitcase. Trying to locate friends that are living there, she mistakenly runs into Mapplethorpe. After rescuing her from a really bad date, the two become an inseparable pair, lovers, friends, possibly soulmates as they begin their arduous, challenging, and ultimately successful lives in the city. They start out with pittance, collecting broken items tossed away and turning them into treasure. People wash into their lives (and sometimes out), with reckless abandon. Many names I didn't recognize, some I did. Smith never name drops for status sake, but for story sake.<br /><br />Smth starts off as a poet, and her prose is very poetic. In fact, it soars when she recounts stories about Robert. Robert forms the emotional core of the book. Her life is definitely formed by his influence, and vice versa. The symbiotic creativity pushed both of them forward until they found their roots and their niche. The weakest parts of the book involve her foray into her musical career, but possibly that was because of my acknowledged lack of understanding of music in general. Whenever Robert comes into her story, Smith's writing blooms and brightens. Her love for him, her understanding of him, shines brilliantly.  In fact, as she winds up her story, and focuses mostly on Robert and his struggle with AIDS, your heart begins to break that Robert's life was ending, and the story is ending. It is some of her best writing, and she saved it for last.<br /><br />Mapplethorpe has almost become an idiom for a profane art show (you're not funding a Mapplethorpe exhibit, are you?). Smith fires back. I hope this book inspires a new path for this visionary art. I also hope this book inspire a new path for Patti Smith; Patti Smith, author.the story is ending. It is some of her best writing, and she saved it for last.    Mapplethorpe has almost become an idiom for a profane art show (you're not funding a Mapplethorpe exhibit, are you?). Smith fires back.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|The best thing about this show is that everyone in my family can watch. My kids ranging from 8 to 16 and my wife and I can sit and watch it together and all laugh. No violence, foul language, just great fun and fantastic writing.
0553381687|5.0|This is the first book in a fantastic in-progress epic fantasy series loosely based on the historical War of the Roses. The book is filled with epic intrigue, battle, and conflict married to a mysterious and building mystical element. If you like epic fantasy, you will not be disappointed that you picked up this book nor the series.
0312600844|1.0|Simply put, as an avid reader, I have only given up on a couple of books, ever. And finally yesterday I called it quits on this sprawling, depressive saga in which no character emerges likable, let alone redeemable, and the plot sags along like a sluggish retro-description by recovered druggies of the 1960s. You can try valiantly to stick with it, wondering at the raves and awards, or like me you can just free yourself from this lackluster effort.
1556438850|5.0|When I saw the size of the book (manual), I took a gulp and set it aside. Then one night I decided to give it a try and couldn't put it down.  Written so well - very down to earth and enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|I enjoyed the Theatrical version of Salt, but the Unrated version blows it out of the water.  Some of the story elements are rearranged in a really great fashion.  Also, a powerful scene in the original is even better in this cut.  It's hard to list the differences without spoilers.  Excellent movie.
B000F8O2OM|1.0|Very poor quality control!  I just bought some of the Thinpacks and have problems with discs on season 1, 2, 3, and 8.  I have yet to watch other seasons.  Some episodes are simply unwatchable due to defects in the discs.  I checked each disc carefully and they are not scratched, but there is a manufacturing defect in them that causes these problems.  Luckily, I bought these seasons on sale for $9.99 each but I would caution anyone about buying the Stargate SG-1 dvd's.  You may get discs with errors on them that render some episodes unwatchable.  Here are the bad episodes on my Season 2:  Disc 3-episodes 4 and 5  Disc 5- episodes 3 and 4
B004EAQNO4|5.0|I don't see how anyone could give this a poor review or rating. So maybe some of it is familiar, but we have been making films for quite a long time now, and originality is tough to come by. These kinds of films that tell a story, that draw you into the common human elements, that have you doubting humanity and bring you back to hope are hard to come by. There was a time, as this film points out that we listened to the stories and wisdom of our parents and grand parents, now we move long distances from them and hardly call them, we put them into old folks homes to die. What this film brings is what we are missing in society. Stories that go in and find a home, and can become a part of who you are. We look for so much action, gore, glory, so much voyeuristic pornography to shock us into excitement that we have lost a sense humanity. If you are looking for any of the aforementioned components don't dismay you will find them in small doses, but don't pass on this film because it doesn't match up to the gore of a Hostel or Saw. Try something different and maybe you will be surprised.
B00377V6J2|5.0|If you're a SRV fan at the level I am this session with Albert will touch your heart. Stevie really seems to be having a wonderful time with one his main Idols. If you know anything about Stevie's relationship with Albert you'll know what it must mean for him to go from a kid admiring Albert at the side of a stage to actually becoming a Peer.  Get this DVD, you will love it.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|OK, we all know this is a fabulous movie with amazing special effects and a heavy-handed ecological message.  With regard to this particular edition, I got it because it has a special edition with all the bad language taken out.  I don't let my 7 year old see PG-13 movies because of the language and occasional booty shots.  This movie doesn't have any of the latter, so I was really hopeful that the PG-13 rating was because of thematic elements and battle scenes.  Alas, the gratuitous vulgarity squashed those hopes.  But then I found this edition.  It has the regular theatrical release, an extended cut, lots of bonus features, 45 minutes of deleted scenes AND (ta da!) a Family Audio Track that removes all objectionable language.  And it really does!   All of the bonus features are great and the price on Amazon is really fantastic.
B002ZG9968|3.0|I enjoyed this film...yes it can be considered predictable..silly..more of a movie made for TV..Yet I found it charming, fun, and a great escape from the normal routine of life for 90 minutes. Its a movie to just sit back..relax, laugh, and enjoy!
B002ZG99CC|3.0|The story is basically the same with the setting changed to China, the kid is AA instead of Caucasian, the martial arts are kung fu instead of karate and the fact that Jackie Chan really knows martial arts whereas Pat Morita did not.  You can really tell that Jaden Smith worked hard on his techniques and makes quite a transformation to a buff little kid.  It is a little faster paced than the original.  For die-hard fans of the original, no remake could live up to its reputation, but I enjoyed it, my kid loved it; in fact, when we saw it in the theatre, it was packed and the whole audience cheered at the end, so I would say it definitely works as a stand alone project.
B003YLM780|3.0|This is an old movie.  It's in black and white, but there's no reason not to watch the colorized version as the Black and White is not nearly as glamorous as in \\"Copacabana\\" or as essential as in \\"Citizen Kane\\".  It's a slow movie, and here that's not necessarily a good thing, as several reviewers have noted.  It's a \\"boy has girl/loses girl/gets another girl/loses her too/no spoiler here\\" type of plot which was quite common when you couldn't shuck your clothes and rub fabulously naked, beautiful bodies together, as they do today.<br /><br />You do get great music.<br /><br />A lot of people note the confusion with the later, technicolor, post-war \\"version\\" known as \\"White Christmas\\" of which I, like a lot of people, can't stand.  That film had issues, not the least of which was the post war cultural divide that was just beginning to tear the country apart.  This film is really a pre-war film in that for the most part everything in it relates more to the era before the war, than the war era itself, although there is a brief musical reference to the war that had just begun for the United States.  That makes it even more interesting for people who like watching films for stuff beyond the plot.  For one thing, the clothes the women wear to dance in are not nearly as grand as the dresses they wear elsewhere in the film.  In that sense, their clothes and shoes reflect a more modern, post-war attitude towards Dance.  Sensible, flexible clothing.  Fred Astaire's partners here all dance nearly as well as he does.  Not a one of them is as good as Ginger Rogers.  Yes, Ginger Rogers was so self conscious when dancing with Astaire, but what she lacked in dancing talent she made up for in Glamour.  Astaire doesn't just dance, he IS dance.  As a leading man, a romantic interest, he's a stretch, but when he's dancing, he owns the stage.  The women in this film are nearly as good as he is, save for living the music, yet they seem like ghosts next to Astaire.  With Astaire's innatetalent, it took Roger's glamour to make the pair.<br /><br />Oh well.<br /><br />One of the touches that makes this film worth watching (once a year) is that while it's obviously a set, and a ridiculous set at that--a farm house the size of a lodge, as if a family of ten added a house for ten to an existing house for ten, and then their kids built another house for ten next to that--and it looks like every seafood cafe/New England in California joint you've ever seen--but near the end, when Der Bingle goes Hollywood, the entire Inn is \\"recreated\\" on a soundstage--and you get to see the set you've just spent so much time suspending your disbelief in, just as it really was, with the soundstage walls towering above, huge doors on massive hinges, and snow released from the rafters on command.  I love it!<br /><br />As holiday movies go, this is a slow one, more for the adults who can self medicate than for the kids.  I'm not sure how younger, more edit-oriented/skin contact film goers would respond.<br /><br />It's so much better than \\"White Christmas\\".  And why not do a holiday party sleep over (if you don't live in a city where you can walk home) and have all the adults come in something comfortable, bring plenty of spirits and fun food, and watch this the way you'd watch a film at the Castro Theater---laughing at everything that is the slightest bit funny, and having fun with everything that isn't?

0061997811|5.0|My 16 year old is a DIE HARD Harry Potter fan.  She has the authentic robe, wand, broom... the books she reads, the hardback books still in plastic... collectables, even her class ring is symbolic of Harry Potter!  She was thrilled with this book for Christmas!  Outstanding look at behind the scenes with little collectable features inside!  A must have for Muggles!
B00003CX5P|5.0|My dad has liked the Star Wars movies and had this on VHS. We got it for him on DVD so he can actually watch it in his room.
B00003CXP1|3.0|In short, I'm not really sure what everyone else saw in this movie that I did not. It was, at times hard to follow and other times just down right silly and/or un-interesting. Didn't rate high on my personal \\"richtor scale\\".
B003UESJH4|5.0|I can enjoy fine movies with minimalist acting.  Where the actors spend a lot of time saying nothing, but looking very serious, or hurt, or angry or whatever.  The kind of the thing that lots of young American actors like to do these days.  Where emotions are bottled up.  This can be very effective.    But sometimes, you just want to have a good, old-fashioned wallow in the kind of meaty, no-holds barred acting that, frankly, the British do best.  And the best, most satisfying example of that this year is THE KING'S SPEECH, a terrific, interesting, engrossing and surprisingly emotional film about a monarch who stutters.      In the years between the two great wars of the 20th Century, King George V ruled England and its colonies with a stern disposition and unshakeable self-confidence.  His eldest son, Edward, is a dashing playboy type, but looks forward to his time on the throne.  Younger son Albert (\\"Bertie\\") is shyer and more conservative...in large part because he has a rather pronounced stammer that years of consulting experts has done nothing to cure.  He has a strong wife in Elizabeth, and dotes on his daughters Elizabeth and Margaret.  And he has no ambitions to be king.     His wife convinces him to start consulting with Speech Therapist Lionel Logue, a commoner with some highly uncomment techniques.  Not only does he work on the mechanics of speech, but he believes that stammers also come from a psychological place as well.  He's a sort of psychologist too.  He works with the prince, insists that two men work on a first name basis, and through sheer force of his eccentric personality, begins to wear the reserved Albert down to the point where we learn much about his upbringing.    And then, as WWII nears, George V dies and Edward serves only briefly, because the scandal of his love affair with divorced American Wallace Simpson forces him from the throne...and George is horrified to find himself about to be crowned.  And eventually, George will have to giveperhaps the most important nationwide radio address anyone had ever given in England up to that point...a speech rallying his people to the cause of war.  He can ill afford to stammer his way through a speech that needs to inspire confidence and patriotism.    It's a fascinating story, utterly engrossing.  But it's the uniformly great acting that elevates this to such a high level.  Small but effective parts are handled by folks such as Michael Gambon (King George V...excellent), Derek Jacobi as the archbishop, Guy Pearce as King Edward (he's quite good) and Jennifer Ehle in a small but delightful role as Logue's wife.  Helena Bonham Carter is more restrained than usual, but also very effective as the Queen.  She clearly dotes on her husband, which makes her very sympathetic, yet she also shows that the trappings and conventions of royalty suit her.  The two appear to be that seeming rarity, a royal couple that are actually happy with each other.  But all this great acting is just icing on the cake for the pure movie-going joy of watching Colin Firth (as King George VI) and Geoffrey Rush (as the uncommon commoner) go toe-to-toe.  Both actors are at their finest.    Rush can incline towards the hammy (as in the PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN movies) but when the script matches his natural characteristics (such as the unappreciated QUILLS)...he's just a joy to watch.  His timing is exquisite and his commitment to his work is amazing.  And Firth, though a more \\"restrained\\" actor, chews into his role with understated ferocity (this seems to make no sense...but see the film and you'll understand).  He makes his Bertie so sympathetic...but rather than just playing a shy stammerer, we see his integrity, his wit, his pain and his explosive temper.  His struggle against the casual attitude Logue takes with him is so much fun to watch, as are the great moments these two have together when they discover how well the King speaks when he is cursing.  The two develop an odd but deeplyaffecting friendship.  I don't know if the film presents history accurately...but it sure presents history as it would be nice to believe it happened.  Both actors should be slam dunks for Oscar nominations...and Firth will be hard to beat.  It may be his best \\"upper class British\\" performance to date.      The film is a bit manipulative. The climactic moments being heavily punctuated with Beethoven seems a bit heavy handed.  Some of the dialogue is just TOO good to be believed.  But the two actors and their co-stars plow right through any weaknesses or pandering to the audience.  A measure of the success of the film...my 23 year old son and 18 year old daughter loved it.  For a film so far out of my son's comfort zone to grab him to the extent it did says a lot.  This is a film worth seeking out and seeing immediately.
031237593X|5.0|I just love rich historical novels that take you to another time and place and give you a feel for how people in another time and place lived, thought, worked, and played.  I want enough drama in the plot, and richness in the historical detail, that I go to sleep thinking about it, and then wake up the next morning *still* thinking about it.  And I want to learn something about history, which requires that the book be reasonably faithful to the events it describes.  The Sunne In Splendour is all of this, and then some.<br /><br />The Sunne In Splendour (I read it on Kindle) is about the adventurous but ultimately tragic life of Richard III, brother to Edward IV (who preceded him on the throne).  For most of the book, Edward IV is King of England, and Richard III is the favored, trusted brother; toward the end, briefly, he becomes King.  This is a very complex story with many characters and subplots, which takes place during the War of the Roses, a civil war in England between the Houses of Lancaster and York in the late 15th century.  The politics of the time were Machiavellian in the extreme: power-politics, scheming, and occasionally outright treason were the norm, along with laying waste to much of the English countryside through continuous warfare.  Within that context was a strange morality, brutal and foreign to the modern eye, but scarily comprehensible on its own terms.  The book provides a rich, detailed look at the lives of all of the major players in the War of the Roses.  It cannot be overstated how rich a tapestry this book is of 15th century English court life.  What really comes through in the book, in a super-interesting way, is how inherently unstable is an absolute monarchical system.  Such a system requires a strong king with a legitimate, widely-recognized claim to the throne, a loyal following of powerful supporters who (continue to) see their self-interest as aligned with the monarch's interests, and a healthy male heir.  Any change in any of those variables immediately produces instability and danger, and the balance of power among competing factions is continually in flux as a result.<br /><br />I did feel at times like fewer words would've helped a bit.  It could've been 10 percent shorter and told the same story, but at a slightly faster pace.  Some of the love story stuff was slightly tedious.  But I'm a guy, what can I say.  I want to read about politics, battles and history, not hand-holding and walking in the park.  My wife, though, who read it on her Kindle concurrently, said she had the same reaction - a few less pages, a bit less meandering, would've made it better.  While the book could've been a few pages shorter, it is still a solid 5 star masterpiece of historical fiction.  Great stuff - highly, highly, highly recommended reading for any fan of historical fiction or English history.iables immediately produces instability and danger, and the balance of power among competing factions is continually in flux as a result.

B002LFPAXY|2.0|I guess I missed the list of selections done with Celine Dion doing the vocals.  This is not what I expected.  Maybe the other contributors should have been listed.  Very disappointed.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|This movie was quite a fun ride. It was very suspenseful and kept me guessing and questioning my assumptions throughout. It had a couple of pretty unpredictable twists. I am looking forward to rewatching the unrated extended cuts and seeing the differences.    UPDATE (12-29-10)  Since reviewing, I have had the chance to watch the two alternate versions.    While the Director's Cut provides probably the eeriest ending, in my opinion, the Extended Cut is the best of the three. Without giving anything away, it provides what is, for the story and the movie, the most realistic ending considering all else that happens. The characters behave in the most believable way (once again, for the story and the type of movie that it is).    The Director's Cut is my second favorite of the three, simply because the ending is quite eerie and ominous.    Theatrical Cut is still a good watch.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|these button extensions were pretty easy to snap onto the existing lower rear buttons on the ps3 six axis controller (not sure if it fits, but it looks like it would fit older controllers as well) and i think they do help by making it easier to get to those lower buttons which is good for games like call of duty where they get a lot of use. the ones i received looked a little different than the ones shown in the product photo, but it doesnt really matter because once its on there you will probably never look at them again.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|A solid movie. Good action, good drama. It really kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen. The four-star rating could improve on multiple viewings of the movie.    Well worth some of the gift card money I received for Christmas.
0374158460|5.0|O.K. Here goes. From what I gather from reading the other reviews, I am going to read and love this novel. I live in St. Paul and I am guessing he is dead on with these characters. The people here are dull bores and are terrible parents and people in general. The thing is that everyone around here says that \\"this is a great place to raise kids.\\" And having the dull/awful woman writing her autobiography is priceless! Because we have \\"The Loft: A Center for Literary Arts\\" where these types of women hang out to get in touch with what they believe is their unique core which everyone will recognize as soon as they can get their \\"story\\" into book form.    Trying to write a current book about modern America is a very daunting task if you at all see it the way it really is and don't buy into what it is supposed to be. I am a former novelist and tip my hat to this guy because, you know what? Most modern day Tolstoy's are too healthy to even want to dwell on it - at all!    There isn't much \\"uplift\\" to our collective story at this time in history. Truth be told, we (the Twin Cities) are gangstalking mecca now! This is an unofficial crime wave sweeping the country, funded by the government in the name of National Security. These people who don't have any society at all to connect with, are easily being duped into this noxious activity of following around designated targets for harassment and ridicule. It is basically a perfect fit for these people who have no idea whatsoever who they really are! Basically, these people are grouped into gangs by someone with local political and law enforcement connections and they are trained in this technology of modern Stazi/Nazi Brownshirts.    That this will lead to the eventual death of the target means little or nothing to any of these people. I'd like to think we are the worst sorts of people in the world, but I fear I am wrong. These people are everywhere around here, driving in packs with their headlights on during sunny days, and following you into businesses and crowding, bumping into you and making rude comments - to them this is great fun!!! They operate in all the grocery stores here and nobody says anything. They never will because there is NO GOOD IN THESE PEOPLE!    So, I am glad Mr. Franzen chose to set his tale of a typical bad American family here, in all its modern innane nastiness. Most of us here deserve the characterization.
1601251505|5.0|The look and feel of this book is great and is well worth the money. Some might say that it's too much like 3.5 to justify the purchase. However, I think most gamers realize and expect a new edition every 5 to 10 years. Also, it keeps my old collection of 3rd edition books fairly useful. While I don't hate 4th edition, WOTC definitely split the Dungeons and Dragons community in half. I'm sure there are good points to 4th edition. However, I prefer Pathfinder as the legitimate successor to the system I have known and played since 1st Edition AD&D. Pathfinder carries the game forward without making a radical overhaul. If you are new to table-top rpgs, you can't go wrong with Pathfinder as it is a solid game with great support. If your an old-timer or returning player like myself, you'll probably prefer Pathfinder (or maybe Castles and Crusades) as the rules are familiar and don't require yet another tedious process of relearning and memorizing.
142314189X|5.0|Bought to encourage my 7 year old grandson to read.  He reads well and loves a challenge.  Popular set that he wants.  Watched the movie and he is excited to read on his own as well as a set his parents will read to him at night and his little brother will be listening.  Keeps everyones interest.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Package came quick. Blu Ray looks excellent and the movie is one of the best 007 movies ever. Also the audio is great. Sounds great. Some demo worthy scenes. Also the difference between this release and the other one was that the audio has been mastered at higher volume so it comes out clearer and louder. So if you're deciding between this and the previous release go with this release.

B000LN7HUC|5.0|Light, compact, cleaning burning and easy to fire up. Have owned this stove for about 10 years now and used on multiple outings. Great for the solo traveler. There is also very little that can go wrong with it so no expensive replacement parts. I would highly recommend this affordable stove.
0439023521|5.0|A great series. Even the style of writing speaks to the strangeness of this \\"new world\\" in which no one can emotionally afford to care for anyone for very long...for who knows when The Capitol may decide their time is up? Currently about to read #3.
B004GGM444|5.0|Skrillex's production quality is unmatched. Listen to this album in the highest quality you can find (~320 kbps) and with the best headphones/speakers you can find (for me it's the Ultimate Ears Triple Fi 10), and his production will really stand out. Skrillex is incredibly talented and utilizes a highly unique sound. Part of his talent is his ability to draw from all forms of music- Electro, Dubstep, Rap (see: Scatta), Pop (see: Lady Gaga remixes), and his metal (see: The Sadness will never end) background to form an amazing and intense sound. Skrillex does not judge what is good music or not- he sees music as neutrally as possible, mixes and melds all these styles on the platform that is electro. In order to produce the trebles, mids, and bass as cleanly as he does, there is no substitute but a lot of time and effort. Get the best quality Skrillex you can find, combine that with good speakers/headphones, and you will have one heck of a time
B0000EES3V|2.0|I received this book as a Christmas gift from my wish list.  It was my intent to obtain not only the original story, but also the original artwork (reprints, of course).  I was happy to add this book because it claimed that Leech was the illustrator.  Much to my disappointment, this was not the case.  Tom Kerr was the illustrator for my version of the book.  So be warned!  The artwork of John Leech does not exist in this book.  Pity.

B001EN71DQ|5.0|Great quality! Came in a cute box set. Each DVD had its own hard case plus a bonus disk! Worth much more than I paid! I love Star Wars!
B000JIHP88|3.0|I think this mobile is very neat looking, and sturdy. It is heavy but secured easily to our crib. Our daughter seems to like it, she is 7 months but can't crawl yet. The volume is just fine even on the lower setting for us. Our daughter isn't around a lot of loud tv or anything anyway. The rain forest sounds are a little quiet but that's okay because they are mostly crickets anyway. I love the music, it is so clear, it sounds great, all of the settings are soothing, not too fast.     I have not seen any other reviewers say this, so I am hoping we got a defective one but our mobile has one big leaf that sticks and delays coming down, and when it does it makes a fairly loud clunking noise which sometimes startles our baby. I don't think we could possibly use this mobile to help her sleep... or a future younger baby sleep. We plan on exchanging it and if our new one clunks I am not sure what we will get.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|I will make this short and sweet:<br />1. The animation was wonderful - very cool to watch.<br />2. It was WAY too scary for a PG rated movie. I have 3 kids ranging from 9 to 3  years old and they were all terrified & covering their eyes AND ears. As soon as they uncovered them, another scary scene came along. It was one scary scene after another. They were too scared to watch most of the movie.<br />3. The characters use 1800s english, with accents, which was very difficult for my kids to understand. They kept asking me what they were talking about.<br />4. Overall, I think it was a pretty good movie, but it just wasn't made for little kids. I think it's appropriate for kids ages 10 & up. I'm giving it three stars because I feel that it was marketed to little kids, and was not appropriate. I would not have rented it had I known how scary it was.
B000R7GKQE|3.0|I was very happy when my product came in, the timing for my order was amazing as usual. But, when i opened the new complete season of Supernatural, i found it to be ripped inside, like it had been eaten and there were bends in the flaps and some disks were covered in something sticky. This was the first time this ever happened to me since i've used Amazon, so i am very disappointed.... I collect perfect condition DVD boxsets and now i will have to return it to get one of better quality.<br /><br />I don't like to complain or bag on Amazon because i love it and i recommend Amazon to everyone... but i want to let them know that the New product they sold me didn't seem very new at all.

1439107955|5.0|The Emperor of All Maladies is a masterful combination of social, philosophical and scientific history of cancer. Mukherjee seamlessly weaves clinical excerpts from his fellowship with a complete history of human encounters of cancer from the ancient Egyptians to now. Given Mukherjee's background, one would expect the thorough review of the scientific history, but the discussion of the political, social and philosophical aspects of cancer was unexpected. Despite the heft of the topic, the book was a page turner and I highly recommend it to any curious mind.

That being said, this book is a beautifully written poem from first page to the last.  It rides through an apex of the New York arts scene in the late 60s and early 70s with grace and style.    I loved it.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|Ok the first movie Twilight got me interested in reading Step's books and i went ahead and read all four of them. The second movie was alright, nothing special, but oh well. Now this third movie... My God did they butcher it or what! It jumped from point to point in the movie. I guess it may just be me since i see so many other reviews that love the movie, but come on! Even the scene with Jasper meeting Alice for the first time was terrible. Oh and showing the vampires breaking apart like concrete.... really... seriously... If i could i would put zero, but i did like seeing the background on Riley, since i wondered about how he fell in with Victoria. I expected so much more from reading reviews. Well Do not worry, i won't be putting money up for the fourth movie, oh wait i should pf said fourth movie part one right? Then i should add that no money for part two either.
B0038P9LTU|4.0|Great solo's, sound's a little like operaetic Blind Guardian, not that Blind Guardian ain't none too opera-like.  It's not pagan, it is christian, in a Middle-Earthy (Lord of the Rings) sort of context.  Which would turn me off to the music if not for the instrumentmanship being so Excellenct; on account of the dipolarity of the subject matters of wizards and sorcery and fake lands and monarchs... then Angels?  Not actaually familiar with Rhapsondy of Fire, but I know what I like.  No preaching about God, obviously, which I can discern.  But they sure do like Angels.  They should put that in an FPS... Opera Like spoken in movie trailer voice.
B001DE29SS|5.0|I have to say, it took me a very long time to finally get around to watching this movie.  But I can see why it's so very popular. This film is amazing! Robert Downey Jr. captured the essence of Mr. Chaplin with an ease and sincerity that was beyond believable.<br /><br />Definitely one of my all time favorites! Any movie that makes me want to watch it again and again is a winner in my book.
B002ZCY7TG|4.0|No, I'm not going to give anything away. But the episode synopsis on this title tells you EVERY SURPRISE IN STORE IN EVERY EPISODE! If you are new to the series and want to be surprised, I suggest you turn away when choosing an episode. I'm not kidding, they tell you EVERYTHING!  Other than that, the blu-ray transfer is gorgeous with a good soundtrack. I knocked a star off for the reason cited above.
0307454541|3.0|When I read fiction I want to be entertained  and  at the same time I hope that the author did some research to portray  the location, time the novel is playing in  and the culture correctly. I thoroughly enjoy books showing me how other people, cultures, countries live.<br />I usually am not interested in reading about serial killers, rapists and Nazi-type characters. I only found my interest in Larsson's books aroused when I made the connection with what is happening to Assange in Sweden. After reading about his problems in Sweden being accused of rape and hearing that the Larsson novel deals with rape in Sweden, I decided to read it.<br /><br />I am not very familiar with Sweden, but I always considered all of the Scandinavian countries as the most desirable to live in, if you can put up with the climate.<br />Getting into the book I was shocked first with the language, but as I read it in the American version, I attributed the language to the translator, having experienced many times that books are translated to fit the country they are published in.<br />But even more shocked I was with the never-ending parade of rapists, serial-killers, cheaters, Nazis, corrupt and completely ineffective policemen, sadists, lesbians, etc. populating Sweden. And if I believe that Larsson's portrayal comes close to reality, I certainly would not consider Sweden as one of the most desirable countries to live in. But I have to say that I do not think that he paints an accurate picture of his home land, but of course I do not know enough.<br />Being in my sixties I have to say that I was sort of fascinated by the  portrayal of the young heroine, though for me she very quickly started to look like a cartoon character.  Tiny, abused, poor without any social net she somehow managed to conquer everyone and everything. Being an expert in many fields without any explanation how she got there but pure genius.  From my tiny life experience very rarely persons are all around experts. Even more I was fascinated by her incredible ability to hack into any computer she wants too. It makes me afraid to open up my laptop.<br /><br />I have not visited Sweden in decades but I thought that the author did a good job to show the Swedish life style and I did not mind at all to learn  in detail how they live, eat , drink coffee and the location descriptions.<br /><br />I have never lived in the South of the U.S.,only visited, but every time I read Grisham's novels I love his descriptions of  the life in the South and recognize the places I visited from his descriptions. .<br /><br />I read the book over the holidays and got caught up in it, but with a deep sense of dissatisfaction, having read too much improbable stories and meeting too many people, who do not care about the life or feelings of others.<br /><br />  And somehow the book seemed to confirm that what Assange is going through with the Swedish justice system is pretty close to reality.

B003YD00RS|4.0|Use a checklist.  This is the major takeaway from Atul Gawande's latest, \\"The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right\\".  Although it's a short book, with just less than 200 pages, it was a difficult for me to get through.  I don't know if that is because I've spent my entire career in and around checklists and believe in their value already (I don't have to be convinced) or because Gawande is reaching too far with his message.  Doing a complex job correctly demands following a checklist.  He suggests that better team cooperation, communication, and discipline are the components of getting things right that emerge from the use of a checklist.  He uses as his fundamental example the growth and now ubiquitous use of checklists in aviation.  And for sure checklists designed to operate something as complex as a large multi-engine aircraft demand such instructions...they also require team skills, communication, disciple, and a lot of experience...which he points out.  He applies his analogy to surgery and how a checklist used during a surgical procedures could help eliminate the most common mistakes made in the operating room...introducing infection, unexpected blood loss, operating on the wrong side of the body, etc.<br /><br />This, of course is rather frightening because I've always viewed the modern operating room as a place where they have already reduced the procedure to its simplicities and required safety checks thereby allowing the surgeon to concentrate on the task at hand.  Perhaps I've been watching too much television where the actors (doctors and nurses) are so familiar with their scripts they work as a team.  The truth according to Gawande is a bit different.  It is normal in a large modern hospital for a surgeon to show up for an operation with a team he has never worked with before...this is particularly troublesome when we now realize they don't have a script or the most rudimentary of  checklists to follow.  How could that be?  No wonder mal-practice insurance is so high!  It's incredibly ironic that we pay more for a medical procedure so the highly skilled doctor can afford mal-practice insurance so when he is in the operating room he can wing it with a team of stand-ins.  For the love of God with other expletives deleted!<br /><br />Don't we all use checklists several times a day?  Checklists are everywhere.  \\"Read this First\\" stickers, warning labels, recipes, instructions, trouble-shooting guides, home improvement tips, and even Google maps.  And we have all not used checklists.  We bake bad cookies, we break things, and we get lost.  Those of us with complex jobs undoubtedly have checklists, standard operating procedures and directions at work which we don't tend to ignore like the ones we do at home.  I am dumbfounded by the lack of checklists as reported by Gawande in the medical industry.  Dumbfound isn't the correct word...appall is closer to my true feelings.<br /><br />Because of this disconnect I've got a considerable amount of criticism for this book and I've been struggling between giving it one star because there is not a single original thought when it comes to large scale, complex program management and the utility of checklists...but then Gawande isn't a program manager and is therefore way out of his element.  And this book is not like his other books where he is an undisputed master of the domain within which he writes.  On the other hand, five stars definitely seem appropriate since he points out this magnificent oversight to the medical community.  And if the medical community is his audience then he has done a decent job reporting on the subject.<br /><br />So in the end I'm going to settle on four stars simply based on the potential value this book could have within the medical community.  I will highly recommend it to medical professionals.  But anyone else, particularly those with a lick of common sense can avoid reading this book and just read the warning labels first.  And we should give thanks that most other professionals in industries that can get us killed or can harm the public, such as the military, transportation, construction, manufacturing, power generation, etc, discovered the checklist a long time ago.professionals in industries that can get us killed or can harm the public, such as the military, transportation, construction, manufacturing, power generation, etc, discovered the checklist a long time ago.
0375842209|5.0|So much has been written here about this magical book, but I wish to add to the long list of those that feel that The Book Thief is a wonderful experience for you and shows WWII Nazi Germany from an entirely different perspective. Liesel and Rudy are childhood friends and neighbors, best of friends really, that live in a small suburb of Munich. Their exploits during the war are told in a story so delicately and beautifully written that it was a pleasure to pick up, and hard to lay down each evening at bedtime. I imagine that this is how life must have been for many families in Germany during these difficult years.     I loved this book and am thankful that I experienced the gifts of Mr. Zusak.

0374290024|3.0|It is hard to decide how many stars to assign to this book. Ian Morris' book would deserve 5 stars if it were merely a world history book. It succeeds in creating a unified, comprehensible narrative of world history from the stone age to the present day in a way that no other book I am aware of has done. For this reason, it would deserve to be classified as a classic.    However, on the other hand, the aim of Ian Morris has not been to write a comprehensive history of the the major world civilizations from the stone age to the present. It has been to explain the Western predominance of the last centuries and to predict what the future will look like. His discussion of the future is quite admirable and thoughtful indeed. However, I have found his answer to the central question the book poses to fall below ordinary academic standards on two fronts: it trivializes the question, and lacks novelty.    1. It trivializes the question. The central question of the book is answered by an argument of geographic reductionism and determinism. In short, the Western \\"rule\\" of the last few centuries is attributed to the shorter breadth of the Atlantic Ocean as opposed to the Pacific. This shorter breadth made the Americas more easily accessible to Europeans than to Asians, hence the former created an Atlantic economy, therefore faced different challenges than the latter, responded to them by the scientific and industrial revolutions, and hence rule. I find this argument to be rather simplistic, and I do not think that there was a need to write such a long book if its sole purpose was to put this argument down (after all, it has been said before - see below). The problem with this argument is that it stops exactly where the truly important questions should be asked. A case in point is Columbus: the author makes fun of him, calling him the best candidate for a \\"bungling idiot\\", because he thought he had arrived to the (by then obsolete) \\"land of the Great Khan\\", while he had only reached Cuba. However, the author fails to notice that Columbus did not reach the Americas merely due to the short breadth of the Atlantic Ocean: he ventured in the open sea aiming to sail as long as it took him to reach the other end of Eurasia, knowing that he should end up there eventually. Even if he had to cross the Pacific instead of the Atlantic, there is a high chance he would make it. It is surprising that, while the author tackles so many \\"what if\\" scenaria to prove his thesis, he fails to consider this fundamental \\"what if\\" question for his main argument: Would Columbus fail to reach the Americas if he had had to cross the Pacific instead? Given that Magellan did cross both the Atlantic and the Pacific a few years later, the answer appears to be in the negative. This observation by itself appears sufficient to refute the author's trivial main argument. The same reasoning applies to several other arguments in the book. For example, the author tries to argue that Newton thought what he thought because of the Atlantic economy, and he has no room for any cultural factor in it; he maintains that \\"each age gets the thought it needs\\". In essence, he maintains that thought is geographically determined. I find this fancy argument hard to accept, as I have not seen any convincing evidence for it. Last, but not least, some of the claims in the book are factually wrong: he attributes the invention of the wheelbarrow to China and claims that it was brought to Europe in the Middle Ages; however, there is evidence of wheelbarrows in construction sites in Ancient Athens.    2. It lacks novelty. The central argument of geographic reductionism and determinism that Ian Morris espouses is not new. It has been made by Jared Diamond in \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" and by J. M. Blaut in \\"Eight Eurocentric Historians\\" before. Surprisingly, the author fails to give proper credit to these authors for making similar arguments, although he does at least cite Diamond. Moreover, the so-called \\"advantage of backwardness\\" of Western Europe, which forms a secondary argument in the author's thesis, has also been made by Patricia Crone in \\"Pre-industrial Societies\\". At least Morris does a good job of bringing these arguments together in a coherent way, but does not go beyond them to deeper issues that need to be addressed (as discussed above).
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is easily one of the best movies I have seen this year.  It is the true story of how Duke of York overcomes his stammering problem with the help of a speech therapist named Lionel Logue.  Colin Firth portrays  Bertie, also known as the Duke of York.  He becomes King George VI after his older brother is not fit to be the king of England. Geoffrey Rush plays Logue.  Both men give Oscar worthy performances.  The film is set in England in the mid to late 1930s.  These are years leading up to World War II.<br /><br />  The heart of the movie is how the relationship between the Bertie and Lionel Logue develop during the movie.  Bertie is apprehensive of Logue's ability to help him with his sppech problem at first.  Much of the humor of the film lies in the methods that Logue uses to help Bertie to overcome his stammering problems.  He encourages Bertie to sing songs and recite tougue twisters to improve the fluency in his speech. This film shows the personal struggle of a British monarch that I knew nothing about.<br /><br />Michael Gambon costars Bertie's father King George V.  England is in need of a king that can inspire confidence in  people.  Michael Gambon conveys this well in the few scenes that he appears in  He is an actor with a strong on screen presence.  Helena Bonham Carter is also very good as Bertie's supportive wife Elizabeth.<br /><br />The music adds so much to the film.  French composer scores the film and provides the movie.  I listened to the soundtrack after I watched the movie.  My favorite music  in the film is a piece entitled the Rehearsal.  The piano playing is beautiful.  This track is light and breezy.  There are also somber instrumental pieces of music in the movie as well. This film includes uplifting classical pieces like Beethoven's Emperor concerto that I love.<br /><br />The King's Speech is an excellent film.  It contains very funny moments between the two stars of the movie.  It is also superbly scored by composer Alexandre Desplant.  It shows the personal struggles of a British monarch not too many people in America know about.  The King's speech proves that biopics can be entertaining and humorous.t shows the personal struggles of a British monarch not too many people in America know about.

It just goes to show that when it comes to 25 billion dollars, all bets are off. I never knew this about Mark Zuckerberg and what he did to his friends and the ideas he stole for making facebook. All i know is from now on, 'The Revenge of the jocks ' series will now start to happen.<br /><br />Onto the movie, it was a tightly packed thriller (with flashbacks) and done in a very edge-of-the-seat but smart fashion.

The guitar work is stellar, the songs very lyrically well written on variable topics & by god this album just is good-ole fashioned METAL !!  The best cuts on the album vary to my mood, but usually are The Abyss, Blood of the Nations, Rolling Thunder & the blistering closer, Bucket Full of Hate.  I never saw this coming nor did most people but after months of playing this album I'm just stunned at the overall quality. In due time will be recognized as one of Accept's finest in their history.

I like the way it engages her imagination, teaches her history (and leads her to ask us questions about \\"how things used to be\\"), and shows her the vast difference in the abundance and complexity of our current lives versus those of simpler, more family-oriented/family-dependent times.  Although she loves the Magic Tree House books on CD series best, these run a close second.  I highly recommend them for a non-screen time, quiet, educational activity.  They're also great to put on your MP3 device and have available for listening to in your vehicle.  This is a purchase you can't go wrong with!

Everything from \\"Best horror movie in last 10 years\\" to \\"easily one of the top 5 horror films of ALL time\\" have been said and so much more. So I thought I would give it a go. Well, this is exactly why you should never go by what other people say. The movie was ok...there were barely any real scares throughout the film, I thought the acting was really subpar, I really didn't give a crap about any of the people in the film. I did however, care about the story. Going into the movie I steered clear of any substantial reviews and possible spoilers, and while watching REC I just had a feeling that this was not you're typical zombie flick, maybe it wasn't about zombies at all.    The last 10 minutes or so lays out the story as to what could be happening in the apartment...and then...you get an unexpected surprise...at least I did. I think the use of night vision when done right can be an awesome effect, and here it is. Some things are better when not fully revealed/seen. I liked the end of the film...but in no way does it make up for the rest and catapult it into any list for me.
1423101499|1.0|I read a few chapters of this where I was staying as guest, then skimmed ahead to see whether I was missing anything. On reflection it seemed like a combination of the worst \\"recap\\" chapters of Oz books, the hip teen vernacular of the Nancy Drew books that causes them to become dated and revised so frequently, and fan fiction based on a superficial understanding of Greek myths. (Had Riordan even done more than browse a dictionary with the most popular classical names? I couldn't tell.) Riordan seems constantly on the verge of avoiding verbal clich&eacute;s -- as if, I surmise he actually wrote the clich&eacute;, then went back to rework it slightly so it wasn't so obvious. The plot was a barrage of \\"sound bites\\" -- strung together without direction, and saved only occasionally by some weakly twisted plot clich&eacute;.<br /><br />I thought about how, as a sometime editor and writer, I could save the book, and had an unusual reaction: Why bother?<br /><br />This volume is hack work, plain and simple. You liked it? Fine. But my guess is that means you'd like any of dozens of other chapter book series equally well. Nothing special here, except for growing boredom and impatience as the pages turn by the hundreds.<br /><br />Parents? This series is no way to get your kids acquainted with fiction or formal writing. (If they emulate this stream-of-consciousness \\"cool\\" style, they'll get low grades.) Avoid, avoid, avoid.

This is a good book, not great and I'm not quite sure why all the great reviews. I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles, maybe not economics 101. In summary, well worth your time to read but not a good enough book to truly fit it's title.

There is a very detailed instruction sheet included that is easy to read and understand. If you go to the Kymera website, you can download an ownership certificate and read up on the wand origins and frequently asked questions.     The wand works well and is fairly easy to program. I have successfully programmed buttons from two remotes (Cox cable box and Samsung TV) into the wand. Essentially, you put the wand into program mode, perform the wand gesture to be programmed, point the TV remote at the wand tip and press the desired remote command button.

I found myself doing a lot more skimming than I normally do with Child's books, and although there were a couple good fights, as always, this was clearly not Child at his best.  I found myself page turning through more boring background information than normal in Reacher books, and when I finally finished the book although I didn't throw it across the room as I have some books, I also didn't tell me wife what a \\"great book\\" it was, because it wasn't.

0156027321|4.0|Do not judge a book by its cover.  When I first heard about Life of Pi, I literally thought it was a textbook discussing the mathematical number Pi.  The book turns out to be the tale of an Indian teenager who survives a shipwreck for 277 days.<br /><br />The beginning of the novel creates a uniquely foreign setting, which drags on for a good portion of the book without the reader realizing.  The turning point comes suddenly and the book eases into a plot similar to Hemmingway's Old Man and the Sea.  The large middle portion of the book is a daily account of Pi's shipwreck life on a lifeboat.  Martel's vivid language creates memorable images of Pi's survival.  The reader becomes appalled, yet curious, by the ways that Pi is reduced to survive.  While there is a fair deal of repetition day-to-day, the passages do not come out dry.  The latter portion of the story contains a twist that I found chilling and thrilling.<br /><br />The end of the story ends as abruptly as all the action started.  A short passage containing an interview of Pi adds another wave of mystery to the story, but is a fitting conclusion to the novel.<br /><br />The reader is drawn into the life of Pi and convinced that the story is real, based on the tale of a real survivor.

0375842381|5.0|In my writing class at UCLA, my professor taught the class that rereading pieces of literature gives the reader new insight into the work because not only does the time around the writing change, but the reader changes as well.<br /><br />I began reading the first book in Phillip Pullman's trilogy probably over five years ago.  As a nineteen-year-old, that's a good chunk of my life.  My bookmark showed that I had finished the first two books of the series and was about a third-way through the final book.  When I picked up the series to read again a couple weeks ago, I barely remembered anything I had read.  As a child, I never really picked up on characterization or foreshadowing or any of those fancy writing devices that were pounded into my head in high school.  Reading a book as a child was simply a different experience than reading it now with knowledge and experience.  Which way is better?  I can't say.<br /><br />Now I don't have writing skills comparable to any successful author, but Pullman does state that his series is aimed towards children, and it does occasionally show with some of the simpler content and writing.  Armored polar bears?  Well, I admit that I did become a fan of Iorek Byrnison by the end of the series.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best of the series is The Golden Compass.  The opening book creates an amazing fantasy world (with armored polar bears) that sucks the reader in.  There is no specific explanation for any of these wild images--the reader is simply let to believe that Pullman's creations, as wild as they are, are possible and even normal.<br /><br />The Subtle Knife continues the series, adding new characters and adventures, but not as powerfully as its predecessor.<br /><br />Although I think the finale The Amber Spyglass was a solid conclusion to the series, it wasn't as gripping as I thought the ending of this series would be.  The conclusion of Dust wasn't the amazing revelation that I had prepared myself for.  A little disappointing, but Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials gets bumped up half a point for being a part of my childhood memories.<br /><br />Last summer I finished A Series of Unfortunate Events and this summer I followed it up with His Dark Materials.

044656740X|5.0|We all want to be rich.  Or do we?  Being rich means having to pay more taxes and fees according to Robert Kiyosaki in his book Rich Dad, Poor Dad.  Sadly, many people do not think this way.  And that is why those people should read this book.<br /><br />What is it?<br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a moderate length book that contrasts how rich people use their money with how poor people use their money.  It revolves around the author's childhood and how he was trained from youth to make money and not to work for money.  The book makes a couple key points: (1) being financially educated creates opportunities for the rich that the poor do not have access to, and (2) spend your money on investments that will make you more money.<br /><br />Pros<br />This book should (at least slightly) change your life.  It was written in the late 1990s, but it is still very relevant today.  I am not a financial expert, but this book convinced me to become educated in the subject.  Knowledge can save you money.  As stated in the book, \\"Being rich is not about how much money you have, but how much money you keep.\\"  Mr. Kiyosaki uses some great personal examples to illustrate his points on how anybody can become rich.  The writing flows and is easy to understand.  For those who cannot stand reading, the book can easily be finished in a matter of days.<br /><br />Cons<br />A couple editing flaws and typos pop up throughout the book.  The information presented may become repetitive at times.  Kiyosaki advises the general actions to be taken, but does not go into great depth of more advanced financial activities.  He leaves the reader to investigate on his own.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Ribert T. Kiyosaki is a great read for those who do not have much financial knowledge or those who are financially struggling.  It convinces the reader to spend money wisely, a skill that most people in this country desperately need.  The book does not take long to read and will change the way you think financially for the better.<br /><br />9/10 -> 4.5/50 -> 4.5/5

Only difference is that Apple did all the work in conversion and you get instant gratification.   If you can wait one week, then the actual cd's you will have forever and you have no restrictions like what apple puts on the AAC files.  It was a toss up from either getting it from Itunes or buying the actual CD's.   A hard copy that is not copy protected is always better.  Also You can convert to MP3 as opposed to AAC file.   Itunes only gives you a certain quality of sound (128KB)as opposed to when you do the conversion onto Itunes you can choose the quality you want.  You can choose as high as you want ie 256 kb.   Only thing you dont get with the cd is the actual concerts that Itunes store added, but who cares.  You get the actual artwork and literature and and cool case.

B003EV6DBM|1.0|The packaging was a real disappointment in that it was cheap paper that scuffed almost immediately when putting the DVD case into the sleeve.  The case itself is an embarrassment because the plastic disc holder is held in place by a single piece of tape that has come free a month after receipt.  I'm hoping I can still return this.    As for content, that is more disappointing than cheap packaging, which for any collector is saying everything.  While the production values seem to have increased and the FX have improved, the storylines and characterization have gone back a step.  While they seem slightly interesting while watching them, they do not have the sweetheart characterization needed for repeat viewing.  I won't be pulling this out on a whim like I do the previous four seasons.      It seems to me that Moffat has cached a couple of great episodes into a fantastic ego trip.  In the extras he talks about how great his Weeping Angels are but he doesn't seem to realize that the actress who played Sally deserves half the credit because it was her reaction to the situation that gripped the viewer, not the statues.  Great lines AND a great actress made that episode great.  That doesn't translate to this season, but to be fair it wasn't because of the acting.  Matt Smith has a good Doctor but the poor man has to deal with too many ad absurdum one-liners that distance his character from the viewer.  Karen Gillan is ok but has more leg than talent, \\"I'm dressed for Rio!\\" seems to be a poor excuse to keep her dressed teen-skimpy.    After seeing this, I won't be getting the Christmas Special or the next season unless they great outrageously rave reviews.

I've competed at college level athletics, done 5 marathons and 30 triathlons including an Ironman...  This book is revolutionary.  It is absolutely contrarian to a lot of the \\"conventional wisdom\\" about diet and exercise.  His claims are backed up by sound science.  The great thing is he has \\"no agenda\\", of which he could easily by creating products that facilitate many of the protocols.      This book makes a phenomenal gift... I have gifted it to 5 people and they each devoured it and have thanked me over and over.      Great work Tim Ferris... huge contribution to your fellow mankind.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am passionate fan of Pride & Prejudice and I was looking for material that would be similar to the plot and outline of Jane Austen's masterpiece. This movie is every bit as good as Pride & Prejudice. The movie itself is wonderful but there are also extras on the discs that gave me further desire to want more of the characters and the actors that played them. The design of the cover was very recognizable and eye catching. I am very pleased with this purchase and glad that it can be proudly displayed on my Movie shelf along other timeless classics!
B000SMWUPS|2.0|This holds many things and even heavy items. However, I made the mistake of closing it along with the stroller and it bent the metal in half. I assume you need to take it off and re-affix it every time you take out the stroller, which is a pain.
B000H5V8DG|1.0|My boyfriend bought me this set a few years ago.  My excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I saw that all of the disks were scratched and/or dirty, and many were unwatchable (as many, many other reviewers have noted).  This year he spoke to someone at Amazon who informed him that the packaging had been redesigned, so he bought me the set again.  It went back immediately, as the packaging was the same and once again all disks were scratched/dirty.  I am now purchasing each individual season in the normal DVD packaging.  DO NOT BUY this item, the problem HAS NOT been resolved!
1439107955|4.0|Yes, this is a compendium of cancer history and knowledge and briliantly written.  It is lucidly explained how barbaric the cures were for a long time because of ignorance.  Also, made very clear that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and we ought to be looking for more ways to prevent cancer beyond smoking, avoiding asbestos, paraffin, radiation, etc. and that successful prevention is far more likely than finding or creating cures. Explaining how the potential for cancer is in our genes and how important it is in the sea of man-made chemicals we now inhabit to identify which of them affect our genes and turn them on and off. He concludes that eventually it will be one in every two people who can expect to have cancer in their lifetime and before long we will take it for granted as a 'normal' part of the human landscape (at least the one we have created).  So all of this is great!  What is the limitation?  Not surprisingly, he addresses only the conventional therapies permitted by the AMA and practiced by MDs that make lots of money but as he also points out really are curing very few cancers except Hodginks or leukemia and doing little for the majority to extend life with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.  He gives an oblique one line mention of the Gerson therapy, does not mention rife treatments, or any other 'alternative' remedies.  I personally know at least half a dozen people who have been cured of cancer using Frankincense essential oil (breast, bowel, uterine etc.)  It was widely reported in newspapers of the time that Royal Rife's technology could cure cancer-- and he was hounded out of practice.  But the darn machines actually do work for many illnesses. I wish this and more could also have been covered even if it is essentially not allowed as part of a normal medical practice here in the U.S.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Perfect in everyway, perfect in price, perfect in shipping, came just in time for the holidays and made a great gift! I highly recommend this to any one who is half way interested because it is hard to find a much better deal anywhere else
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Loved the DVD/CD combo.  Fun to watch the DVD and see the world come together as the One we are.
038533348X|4.0|You'll need some suspension of disbelief with Vonnegut, as usual, but he's a wonderful writer and his social criticism (especially of organized religion, in this case) is usually spot on. Thoroughly entertaining if a little strange.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|When I read one of the magazines giving a review of this straight to video movie, I had to check it out and glad I did.  This version of Hachi's tale is beautifully told and I love the ending because it is so uplifting to me.  I thought Richard Gere gave a beautiful performance and the dogs who played Hachi in various stages were magnificent. Yes, a hankie movie but it was worth it, especially for dog lovers.
0312370849|3.0|I'm conflicted about this book--I enjoyed it but thought it had the bones to be great rather than just good. Partly, it was form: it tried to be much more literary than it was, and it also used some painful exposition. In a book, exposition can just be ordinary text, whereas on TV it often has to take the form of a voiceover or annoyingly dumb character...but in this book, a lot of the exposition came in dialogue, unnecessarily in my opinion.     I also found the content underwhelming at times: some coincidences were overly neat, in my opinion, given a rich underlying framework that didn't need to be quite so contrived. And ultimately I found the protagonist pretty frustrating: overly mawkish, and not an especially good wife, which may not have been intended.    However, it is an extremely compelling story, and sheds light on a piece of history I knew nothing about: the Vel d'Hiv (which is kind of the point, natch).
B003FSTN7A|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows.  The sixth season is as entertaining as the previous seasons.  My favorites are \\"Bite Me\\" and \\"Time Keeps on Slipping\\". But don't misunderstand, all of the episodes are good.    It's too bad that we may not see the show beyond the seventh season (so I've read)...
0393072231|5.0|Very interesting story of a few different investors who saw that the housing market was overvalued and their subsequent attempts to profit from its eventual decline. As is typical of Lewis, very well-written, describing complicated financial products in easy-to-understand language, with more detail available in the footnotes.
B002ZG98LO|1.0|By adding \\"s\\" to the title, I had some delusion that it might (just might) reimagine the Predator universe like \\"Aliens\\" did for \\"Alien\\".  Nope.  Nothing interesting, new, or fun.  The predators were even boring and dumb.  Nothing very \\"predatory\\" and cunning about them. Just cloaking, missles, and big blades.  Remember the guilty-pleasure, comic book drama and action of the first movie?  None of that here.  Just over wrought acting, poor storytelling, mediocre CGI.....ultimately, a wasted 2 hours for a critical sci fi fan. Avoid.
0385333846|4.0|Typical Vonnegut, meaning very post-modern and a bit jumpy, but by far the most serious of his that I've read. Even though this is fiction, I learned a lot about WWII and especially the US bombing of Dresden.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I bought this for myself for one of my \\"Michael Jackson items\\" for Christmas. When I first listened to it, I was somber about it...then I listened 2 more times and afterwards I began humming the songs without thinking about it. The CD has attached itself to my inner thoughts and now I realize that, I REALLY LOVE IT!!!    Michael sounds so good as usual and I'm listening so intensely that it feels as though I can see him performing the songs. I'm imagining I know the reasons behind the making of the songs. It's strange, but fantastic all the same.    I had always known that I would buy the new CD and now I'm glad I have it in my hands and on my phone and on my computer. I just love HIM and having these songs means so much to me.    I'm trying to decide which one I love the most. I think I love the one featuring Lenny Kravitz, \\"(I Can't Make It) Another Day\\" and \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" for the uptempo songs and for the ballad songs, I love \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" and \\"Hold My Hand\\"...but then I also love \\"Best of Joy\\" and \\"(I Like) The Way You Love Me)\\"...well, I still love them all so the ones I mentioned are just maybe at the top of the list.    \\"Behind The Mask\\" and \\"Monster\\" are neck and neck with \\"Breaking News\\" and \\"Much Too Soon\\" just rounds it all out.    They all sound GREAT because it's MICHAEL!!! I didn't buy anyone else's music for the Holidays, so that says it all for me.
B000J6ZD16|5.0|What a rare find! Autographed by Maugham whose writing is always riveting. His book conveys so much more than the great movie with Tyrone Power due to the censorship which took the sharpness out of the movie. The book includes so much more than the basic plot, which I will not repeat. Read it for yourself and you will agree. I suggest seeing the movie first for comparison and don't waste your time on the Bill Murray remake.
B003XKPPOU|4.0|I bought the combo disc even though I don't have a Blu-ray yet, but did not realize the bonus material would be Blu-ray. My fault for not realizing this. I also thought the digital copy would be able to be seen on Media Center as stated, but not true. You have to watch it on the internet. I don't recommend this combo pack unless you have Blu-ray and high speed internet. I could have just as easily gotten the basic copy. Mostly mistakes on my part, as I said, but they should make it clear as far as the bonus material, and the digital copy.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Why is this e-book $16 and the actual book can be picked up for $3 at betterworldbooks.com? This is nothing short of ridiculous price gouging. Shame, this is the reason why most people haven't made the switch from paper and ink to kindle..
1416562605|5.0|I loved this book. It was completely engaging and heartrending and human. And -- although I really wouldn't know -- I suspect it gives you a pretty good idea about what life is like for a lot of people in India: including the endemic corruption that is part of absolutely everything.<br />I'd bet that if you read this along with Ondaatje's \\"A Fine Balance\\" (even more disturbing and great), you would have a basic understanding of how things work in India.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book was amazing!!!!!!collins did a really great job with making the hunger games sound like they can be very dangerous yet fun when your not being hunted by the other contributes.also when the area of choice by the game makers is exactly what people hoped for.just like how katniss i love that name hoped for a woodland area and a bow and she got the woodland and later a bow and arrows.yayayayay for her.also the sweat and sour ending with the sweet ending of  katniss kissing and hugging petta ust to make him take some meds.then the sour ending when collins leaves you hanging with petta and katnisses &#34;relationship&#34;is growing but overall i loved the book and so did my teachers and classmates.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|The graphics were state of the art at the time. They are more than dated by todays standards but still a good story and fun to watch.
B001U3Y5XE|2.0|We bought this as a family gift.  We were very disappointed.  Firstly, there aren't enough Legos to build the items on the cards.  We had read this before purchasing it, but we have enough Legos and figured we could supplement it.  It's a good thing, because the amount of Legos is pathetically too few to do anything.  Secondly, the items to build (even on the easy deck) were too complicated.  And lastly, the rules just don't make any sense.  If the other team guesses what you're building, you don't credit!  We found that one team was much better builders, but they lost because their creations were guessed.  Very discouraging.  This just isn't a very well thought-out game.  You'd be better off just selling the cards as a companion to a family's collection of Legos!  We now own a game that will likely sit on a shelf.
0451219597|4.0|I really enjoyed this, typically read sci-fi or detective books.  This was my first taste of this style genre and I really enjoyed it.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Just read the Kieth Richards book. this is one of the best stones albums ever recorded.Alot of acoustic guitar work.Recommend highly.
0143118420|1.0|This is a terrible book.  The movie and book are boring and self satisfying.  I felt that both were an extreme waste of my time.  I hope that this helps some other people not waste theirs.
1857885082|4.0|As others have said, Fox's book is witty and full of insights about English culture, understood as the way we do business as usual.  Like other ex-pats, I found it a wonderful articulation of my English ways.  After nearly 40 years in the U.S., I notice how English I am in ways Fox identifies--a self-deprecating habit of turning away compliments, for example, along with all the class-marking prejudices about word usage and having an untidy car.<br /><br />And yet...as I made my way to the end of this lengthy book I felt a growing unease.  I had to keep reminding myself that its subject is culture in that anthropological business-as-usual sense, so perhaps I should not expect any exploration, or even hint, of anything like an English soul, equivalent to the way people talk about the Russian soul.  My England, after all, is also the land of rebellions and revolution, great strikes and marches and movements, of martyrs and saints, of Shakespeare's tragedies, Milton, and D.H. Lawrence (\\"my Englishness is my very vision\\"), to pick just a few of the less mundane elements of English culture.  Fox's England seems soulless.<br /><br />The author is wonderful at identifying all the cultural and class markers of behaviors, tastes, and attitudes that we tend to think of as our own autonomous choices or original thoughts.  At times, though, she expresses her own upper middle-class, secular-liberal, cultural-elite prejudices as if they were scientific observations.  This is nowhere clearer than in her superficial and, frankly supercilious discussion of Christianity (and paganism)in relation to the English.  The book is best read, not as (even loosely) scientific, but as a very perceptive expression of the author's own class, academic milieu, and generational outlook.
1595825045|5.0|This art book is absolutely fantastic! The most interesting feature is on each page are descriptions from Mike and Bryan about how they thought up the show, the development of each character etc. Aside from seeing early drawings of the main cast, it goes from Book to Book explaining each new character and episode idea. I cannot imagine being a fan and NOT having this book. Every page is full of interesting things and cool art. 10/10<br /><br />The book itself is hardcover and VERY nice quality as far as the spine of the book and paper quality goes.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|The Track List<br /><br />This review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:<br /><br />Overture<br />The Grid<br />Father and Son<br />The Son of Flynn<br />Encom Part I<br />Encom Part II<br />Recognizer<br />Armory<br />Arena<br />Round One<br />Rinzler<br />The Game Has Changed<br />Outlands<br />Adagio For Tron<br />Nocturne<br />Outlands, Part II<br />Reflections<br />End Of Line<br />Castor<br />Derezzed<br />Fall<br />Sea of Simulation<br />Rectifier<br />Disc Wars<br />C.L.U.<br />Arrival<br />Flynn Lives<br />Sunrise Prelude<br />Tron Legacy (End Titles)<br />Solar Sailer<br />Finale<br /><br />The Pieces<br /><br />Overture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.<br /><br />The Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don't care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.<br /><br />Father and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.<br /><br />The Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.<br /><br />Encom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.<br /><br />Recognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.<br /><br />Armory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it's one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.<br /><br />Arena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.<br /><br />The Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.<br /><br />Outlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.<br /><br />Adagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn's creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.<br /><br />Nocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It's slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.<br /><br />Reflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.<br /><br />End of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best \\"Daft-Punk style\\" track on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.<br /><br />Fall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don't care for the electronic distortion on this track as it distracts from the main musical theme played.<br /><br />Sea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it's the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.<br /><br />Rectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook's Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good track if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.<br /><br />Disc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.<br /><br />C.L.U. is naturally the villains' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.<br /><br />Arrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It's the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.<br /><br />Flynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.<br /><br />Sunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It's the last track in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.<br /><br />Tron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It's an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.<br /><br />Solar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite track as it's just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it's a favorite track for many people (including my girlfriend).<br /><br />Finale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.<br /><br />The Score<br /><br />Tron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It's THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).<br /><br />The first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn't know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk's album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don't believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn't fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn't have worried.<br /><br />Some have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn't disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...<br /><br />This score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.<br /><br />Too Many Adagios?<br /><br />It appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk's past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.<br /><br />Some have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception's score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).<br /><br />Flynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk's Greatest Achievement<br /><br />When I heard the track Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).<br /><br />It would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.se Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation.

B0024FAG62|5.0|I love this movie.  Kevin Costner is just a crazy kid in this one.  One of his first movies, I presume.  He is very young.  Beautiful scenery.  The other guys are great as well.  This is a good western to sit back and watch with your family.
030746363X|4.0|Ferriss does provide a decent amount of information for people to learn from. He also has a tremendous (and respectable) amount of links and resources. Much, not all, of the information is reasonable.<br />I do have some concerns, but first advice about the book itself. Read it all, then go back and be very picky about what you decide to do (after you've consulted with your doctor, of course). Then do some research, ask your dr., get some sense of the part of the book you think is the most useful for you. Then work toward that goal using Ferriss as a starting point. Accordingly, fitness, like many things, is personal and there is no cookie-cutter routine for \\"everybody\\". Yes, there are movements (i.e. exercises) everyone should be able to perform; yet, in the USA, many people have increased weight to such a degree to be distressing. This book may help those who feel working out or getting in shape is just too hard (it's not, really).<br />My concerns are pretty common based on what I'm reading in other reviews. Nevertheless, Ferriss is rather unclear about the sequence of how things happened in the book. For example, he discusses a number of ways to train (get in shape) early in the text. Later in the text (and later in his life), he discusses his injuries and how he seems to make them all better. What is unclear, for me, is were his injuries caused by his training--the same training he demonstrates in the book? Or his extreme sport activity? Or maybe just genetics? It's unclear. Granted this may be minor, but it could also be major. Although there is very little I find outright distressing (or dangerous) in the book (if I do, he already has noted it, which I find very respectable), one must still be cautious when beginning or renewing a workout (or nutritional) plan.<br />A good aspect of the book is that Ferriss does a lot of the \\"what would happen if X\\" type of research some are afraid to do. He takes this somewhat as a challenge and explains what will happen or has happened based on his experience. This is a key point, based on HIS experience. There is an amount of word play going on here (perhaps because of legal concerns) that hedges some of the information.<br />I'm a certified personal trainer (ACSM H/F I) and have a degree in movement science; thus I think I bring some experience to the table relating to fitness. All this being stated, I'm not making any MAJOR changes, but I am incorporating some of the information (after my research and MY experience) to improve my health. We need a game-changer in fitness to get more people active and healthy, and if Ferriss can do it with this book, I'm all for it.<br />Overall, the book is worth it. His writing style is witty and informational. Be smart, ask questions, and act accordingly. I am convinced that this book will make you think about your health a bit deeper and cause you to act in some way for its betterment.ed based on his experience.

030746363X|1.0|i have been a reader of Ferris's blog and checked out the \\"four hour work week' from the library and read it. I have always suspected, between the occasional good idea usually garnered from somewhere else. Ferris's real 'talent' was appealing to the worst instincts in people and making readers think they are clever for reading him.  This 'book' isn't even a book in any coherent sense. It's a quickly slapped together hodgepodge of blog posts, fad/quack diets and supplements, reader comments (conveniently unverifiable) to appeal to nearly every narcissistic tendency in human beings. Other than the occasional commmon sense advice (chew your food 20 times ) the only thing I came away with in this book is a firm conviction that Timothy Ferris is a dishonest, shallow human being.  a quick online search will show that many of Ferriss's  major claims are dubious at best, and his behavior is ethically questionable.   It also should be obvious to anyone by now, as documented by several bloggers, that Feriss has an 'army' of outsourced reviewers that game the amazon system. Shame on you feriss, for lowing the bar of civic trust.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Before I start this this is not a review this in the first chapter of a book Im writing on the Kindle.Chapters will USUALLY be posted daily and are going to be on different book reviews every new chapter.                    Chapter 1         What is a thought? A thought is something that spreads rapidly and can be contagious. A thought however can be for the better or worse. A thought is most importantly a weapon that is not at its full potitial yet. That is what a thought is.                       My job is simple all you have to do is get in get out and do it quick. My job is instraction however you may have heard of that movie Inception that stole instraction from us and turned it into a freaking Sci-Fi movie. No instraction is hard you have to be very tricky and decieving to get the info that you want to get and if you die in a subconcious state you dont come back. No you dont go to Limbo or any crap like that you just die. So now that you pretty much understand my job lets cut to the chase......         &#34;Rocky&#34;, I screamed as we were about to fall to our death, in a dream.           &#34;What?&#34;          &#34;Do you think we canget outta this one?&#34;           &#34;We either let go and fall off the balcony or the men in there with guns will shoot us.&#34;               P.S. we were at a hotel in a very important man's dreams extracting very impotant info.Yes, we did come into this with guns but thy got taken.        &#34;Remember we have parachuts?&#34;, asked Rocky.         &#34;Yes, of corse I do, but we arent suppose to use them until we absoulotally have to &#34;, I replied          &#34;Well we have to!&#34; So in total unison we both let go and pulled our chutes and landed safely on the ground.            Youre probaly wondering how inthe sam heck do you get out of the dream? Simple, throw yourself in water. Luckily we were at a hotel so that means, a pool.             We made a beeline to the pool and jumped in.
B00314VYNE|5.0|My daughter (she's five) said that she wanted a Jessie doll for Christmas.  We all love the movies, and my daughter dressed up as Jessie this Halloween.  There are lots of Jessie dolls on the market, so I could look carefully and see which would be best for my daughter.  This doll doesn't talk or \\"interact\\" with other Toy Story Toys,  but that seemed like much more than my daughter would want.      This doll looks right.  She's a toy meant to look like a toy.  The red yarn hair looks great. I love that she is pose-able.  One reviewer said that the doll had too much of a Barbie body which gave her too much of a chest.  It may be the way that she is dressed, but I don't notice it that much.      When my daughter unwrapped this toy, she yelled, \\"this is what I wanted!!\\"   She watched TS3 with the doll in her lap. She carries the doll around, and sleeps with her. I think that says it all.

B001TKD4ZI|3.0|I received a Kindle for Christmas and \\"How To Marry...\\" was one of the first books I got. I loved the idea/plot of this book but there was something about it that made me feel like this author had never written before although I know that's not true. There were times I thought I would scream if Roman said \\"God's blood\\" one more time but all in all the book was pretty good. It wasn't one of those books that I would find myself wanting to read again and again but I'm glad I got it.
B00284BNKC|5.0|This is an amazing movie if you haven't seen it. Not only is the movie amazing, but I ordered this on standard shipping and got it two day from the day I ordered it!r
B00479SVBU|5.0|Works GREAT!  It broadcasts a VERY strong signal.  Works well at the top of the dial (107MHz) thru the bottom of the dial (88MHz).  Maybe i imagine it, but stereo separation sounds a little nicer down in the 80's tho.  SInce the signal is so strong, the music comes through the radio nice and loud/solid.  The station does NOT drift like it does in other FM transmitters i've used.  I use it w/ a USB drive since i do not want to have to carry around an SD adapter.  With a FULL 8GB USB flashdrive, it loads and begins playing within moments.  I didn't time it, but feels like it's less than 10-15 seconds.    Only tiny complaint is 3 no-big-deal things -- defintly NOT show-stoppers in ANY way:    1.) i wish there was a power button on the remote.  Would be more useful than the hot key.  2.) i wish that when pressing the button on the remote for \\"next\\" or \\"previous\\" track, it would continuously scroll through the songs -- if You want to move forward ten songs, You have to press next ten times.  They should make the remote such that if You hold down the button, it keeps flashing the \\"next\\" command to the SoundFly's IR receiver... Slowly at first... then accelerating the longer it's held down -- like every other consumer electronics device =)  3.) it would be nice to be able to HEAR chunks of audio while \\"fast forwarding\\"    another note:  it has been mentioned in other reviews that You have to point the remote directly at the unit.  This is SORT OF true, but i find that i can point mine at the roof of the car, and it seems to bounce off the window, and or the mirror, or other semi-reflective surfaces.    i HIGHLY recommend this unit.  SOUNDS GREAT compared to any other FM transmitter i've ever tried (tried many)    it feels SOLID/well-built    Screen looks nice.    In my car i can not tip the unit downward because i have a full-sized thumbdrive...  i ordered a TINY 8GB USB flashdrive (Lexar Echo ZE 8 GB USB 2.0 Backup Drive LEHZE8GBASBNA) so that once i load that one with music, it's SO small, i will be able to tip the unit to make the screen more visible.    The SoundFly has very strong springs for the cigarette lighter/power outlet -- so it doesn't vibrate loose (doesn't lose power/reset).    This product works excellent with this unit http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041RSDXE/ref=oss_product  loads quickly -- and since it's so small, it doesnt' get in the way physically
B004C5M282|3.0|I discovered Volbeat on satellite radio a few years ago. I was hooked. They had a great sound, and just something different in the metal community. I own all the albums up until this one. I bought Beyond Hell/Above Heaven for a christmas gift for my girlfriend who also loves Volbeat. It could have been better. It seemed like they wrote for a radio audience instead of their fans.     They could easily get rid of 3-5 tracks to make this cd a real \\"VOLBEAT\\" cd. This album isn't their first three, but I also understand they have to evolve as musicians. If I had the time, I would go through the album, pick out my own favorite tracks, and make a burnt copy of those tracks I picked. Like I said, I love volbeat, but this cd wasn't them. Thats why I gave them a 3 out of 5.

B00335EQ3Q|3.0|After reading and hearing all about how great this film was I finally decided to buy it. I'd heard that it was supposed to be humorous and romantic with lots of great dancing.     I found that Yes, the dancing was phenomenal and it was sorta romantic (though they could have built up the relationship a little more, the story line was not backed up enough with character history and how they all fit in. When you finally find out what has all been going on with the parents I felt like I was getting whip lash because I had already formed an opinion of the mom and dad and here I got all this new information that I had to reprocess).     As for the humor I totally didn't get. The Mom was ALWAYS screaming and yelling which really turned me off. I don't know if it's because I'm not used to Australian humor or if it just wasn't really there, but I found it a real bummer.   I had expected a lot more from the reviews that I had read.   So all in all, if you are buying this for the dancing then it's a great buy, but if you're getting it for the story line, forget it and get Shall we Dance (Japanese) instead.
B000002V1D|5.0|This was probably my second favorite CD after Notorious. It was also the LAST really good CD they put out, unfortunately. When you go messing with something that works and split up then get back then split AGAIN, people move on. Thus is the case with Duran Duran after the Wedding Album, in my opinion.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|Very superficial. I lived and moved around the world and I believe this books success does only depend on marketing not on its content.
0316069884|1.0|This book isn't for those who simply want to learn more about factory farming from a neutral, knowledgeable point of view. There is a decent amount of information about factory farming but the dilettante author's lack of expert knowledge makes the book seem like a bloated persuasive essay written by a high school English student; especially with the inane personal stories about his grandmother whom he decided to make the motif of this book for reasons I do not comprehend.<br /><br />I don't even understand why the title of the book is \\"Eating Animals\\" if the author's supposed purpose is to spread awareness about the conditions in factory farms and not to advocate vegetarianism. The most probable reason is because the targeted audience IS vegetarians and their sympathizers (I consider myself one) which is why the book is more concerned with appealing to emotion than with concisely giving information on factory farming. It's irritating waddling through pages of the author begging us to imagine ourselves as if we were chickens or giving us fun facts about pigs such as \\"they enjoy playing video games\\". Is this really relevant? If an animal feels pain or anxiety then it is already unethical to subject them to the conditions of factory farms and the rest is superfluous. Since, for example, a crocodile or a rabbit does not play video games or do other things that make them seem \\"more human\\" is it ok to treat them inhumanely?<br /><br />It's this excessive sentimentality, his awkward prose, and his general arrogance that make Eating Animals hard to read, even for those who are already on his side. The Author is not a scientist or an expert on animals, farming, or business so the book is all second-hand information which could've been presented by a more intelligent writer whose main objective would be to inform readers and not to guilt them into vegetarianism (might as well grab a PETA pamphlet and waste less time and no money). Preferrably this other writer would also not waste our time by mentioning his grandmother a dozen times, his dog, or stories about his on-again, off-again vegetarianism.waste our time by mentioning his grandmother a dozen times, his dog, or stories about his on-again, off-again vegetarianism.
B0046UGSNS|5.0|This movie was true to life in a  clever way.  Forgiveness is depicted in a raw fashion that shows the level of forgiveness that humans have.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|The movie is great, but dumbed down down a lot from the books. Some of the characters from the [[ASIN:0439884764 Guardians of Ga'hoole Books]] are in the movie, but the storyline has been completely rewritten and does not resemble the books except for the larger overall plot. If you've read the books and expect to see some of the side characters like, Ruby, Martin, Streak, Zan, Mist, and a handful of other characters and their roles throughout the books you will be disappointed.  However that is not to say that the movie in itself is not a good movie. Its a great movie, and might be great for parents who what to get their children interested in the books. So to end it off, yes the movie is overall a great movie to watch for the young and not so young ones, but if you've read the [[ASIN:0439884764 Guardians of Ga'hoole Books]] don't try to compare the two, you'll just be heartbroken. Just enjoy it for what it is a fun, adventurous, and entertaining movie for the family.
B000067J24|1.0|I was very disappointed (as was my wife, for whom the movie was a present) to find that this is not the full version.  Significant parts have been edited out of even what is shown on cable TV.  The package is not marked as such, but this is a real hack job, wrecking a lot of good scenes.  Thumbs down on this release, my first major disappointment in dealing with Amazon.
0141030933|4.0|The Ghost Road (3rd book of the Regeneration Trilogy) won the 1995 Booker Prize which is what prompted me to start reading the trilogy.    Barker used actual people as the core of her characters and wrote around them.  These characters are the poet Siegfried Sassoon, the poet Wilfred Owen and psychiatrist, William Rivers.  The trilogy is set in the UK during WWI though also describes scenes from the war mostly in France.    For Regeneration, the present is 1917 at Craiglockhart Hospital in Scotland.  The central character is William Rivers, the compassionate psychiatrist who has to deal largely with men who are very damaged by the war.  Most of them simply don't know how to deal with the horrors they have seen.  Rivers job is to \\"cure\\" them so they can get back to the front.  He cares deeply about the men he treats but he also knows his duty.  He is a conflicted man.    The key patient is noted poet Siegfried Sassoon, who was an extremely respected and effective officer.  Sassoon has written a Declaration noting that the war is futile and should be ended.  Rather than court martial him, he is sent to Craiglockhart because to the authorities, he is clearly not in his right mind.    This is a very powerful novel.  It can drag a little as the reader can actually become numb to the decription of the mens' conditions and responses and Rivers' angst and conflict.    I'm about 3/4 of the way through the second book in the trilogy, The Eye In The Door.  I echo the comments of some others that the books are very connected and really should be read in order.    I recommend Regeneration but so far think The Eye In The Door is even better.
0316098337|3.0|Unlike anything I have ever read before, however, not something I could recommend or ever see myself reading again.    A college student is kidnapped off of her campus by a sexual predator/kidnapper and hidden in an insulated shed on his own property for sever years.  She is raped regularly and eventually gives birth to a son. To say that the son, Jack, is a victim of arrested development and suffers from lack of socialization would be a major understatement.  Mom makes a world within ROOM for herself and Jack until their eventual escape.    It is here where the novel turns exploitive as Mom and Jack find it extremely difficult to acclimate back into the OUTSIDE.  When Mom inexplicably tries to kill herself (an unusual plot decision since the woman was a survivor of countless horrors for 7 years and then gets suicidal after a bad press conference) the plot becomes extremely manipulative as Jack is sent to live with Grandma and is, obviously, a fish out of water.    Good --- but not nearly the masterpiece many reviewers are making it out to be.

B003YWUTJI|5.0|This is my first Norah Jones CD.  I've heard some of her solo stuff, but never bought any of it.  Then I heard this CD playing in a local coffee shop, I originally thought they had multiple CD's on shuffle, and asked to see what it was.      It's a nearly perfect background mix for the holidays.  But once you really get into it, you realize how much depth is in the mix.  Great song selection, for some of the duets, you have to look at the liner notes to know who is singing on it, there's some really different musical styles for who's on it.      Obviously this is a CD for fans of eclectic vocal mixes, since it crosses a lot of different artists and styles.  But, for my money, it does it all very well.  Great artists, great songs, great mixing.  Doesn't need a lot of listens to get into, and random songs from this CD fit well into a a shuffle mix.
B003Z420NI|5.0|I just received this set in the mail today.  Right now I'm listening to Volume 10 - \\"Instrumentale - The rise of instrumental music\\".  Greensleeves is playing as I write this review.      I had purchased Volumes 7, 8, and 9 before.  I was very impressed with each of the discs.  Volume 7 is \\"Ars subtilior - Dawn of the Renaissance\\" and is so spectacular.  It is the best collection of music from this era I have come across.  But then, you have artistic groups like The Hilliard Ensemble, the Orlando Consort, The Huelgas Ensemble, Ferrera Ensemble, and Ensemble Organum represented here.  Volumes 8 and 9 are likewise done extremely well and carry on with the music of the renaissance in survey form but with excellent selections and performers.      Since my experiences with the discs I purchased was go positive, I have been looking for other discs of early music from the Century series that came out in 2005.  I was about to purchase the Ars Nova disc when this compilation box set appeared.  Some of the items from 2005 are no longer available as a single disc or incredibly expensive.  I believe I saw a copy of Volume 10 on sale for almost two hundred dollars.      Although I have not listened to all ten discs on this \\"Early Music\\" set, I believe hearing four out of ten is a good sample.  Also the one previous reviewer gave this set three starts but I'm sure that is because he knows nothing about early music.  I did not want to have that three star review stand.  I'm sure as other knowledgeable reviewers come along, the average will approach the five start rating this compilation deserves.      Here's what you get and for only $5.50 a disc:    Vol 1 - Music of the Ancient World  Vol 2 - Chant of the early Christians  Vol 3 - Gregorian Chant  Vol 4 - Minnesanger and other courtly arts  Vol 5 - The birth of Polyphony  Vol 6 - Ars Nova  Vol 7 - Ars subtilior - dawn of the Renaissance  Vol 8 - Sacred Music of the Renaissance  Vol 9 - Songs of the Renaissance  Vol 10 - The riseof Instrumental music.    I am looking forward to hearing the entire set.  I promise to return and either amend my review or put in another one if any disc disappoints.  I don't think so because of the caliber of performers that Harmonia Mundi has available and the intelligence that went into the selection of music for each disc.    If you love early music, this is one box set to purchase to feed your mania.  If you need instruction on early music, this set will help provide that.  The box set is packaged with all ten discs prepared as they were when they came out as single discs, so you have all of the written material and translations of the sung material.  This is truly a bargain and contains spectacular performances of early music you can get no where else.

B000002KBU|5.0|This is my first Joni Mitchell CD.  Definitely won't be the last.  My original reason for picking this up is finally getting my music collection to include the CD's that are on everyone's \\"you must own this\\" list.  So far, everything I've gotton on the list has been great, not a single dissapointment on the list.      This is listed as a Must Own for a reason.  It's an amazing work, the whole CD, beginning to end, is excellent.  It's one of those CD's you can just sit and listen to on headphones, or have on as background music, or include in a mix of great singer/songwriters.      Joni Mitchell is an amazing singer/songwriter.  I had already heard at least half of the songs on this CD before, just from random run-ins at record stores, coffee shops, listenable FM radio stations, etc.  It's pretty much a standard for mixes of vocal music.    Yeah, this is a 5-star CD.  Definitely.
6304602944|3.0|The torture scene in this movie is something to fast forward through, but the rest of it is a fairly enjoyable action and humor flick featuring some good chemistry between Stallone and Russell.<br /><br />Good for some brief entertainment.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|I thought the 3D special effects were cool, but the storyline was a little off. Jeff Bridges gives a good performance as do the other two main actors/actress. I was kind of hoping the outside world would have more of an ongoing impact on the grid, like the corporate big shots find out about the grid and try to exploit it. This never happened.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Movie is unusual in that it starts from the end and goes to the beginning. It shows a man hunting for a man through some seedy gay bars in Paris till he finds the one that had rapped his girlfriend. He then beats the guys head in with a fire extinguisher. This guy had brutally raped his girlfriend at a subway station. The rape was long about 9 minutes and was not erotic in any form. It showed the horrors of this crime. This film did a great job of creating this story backwards. I would recommend it to everyone that enjoys movies that are well constructed. I would have to say this was one of the better movies I have watched in recent times.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This review is for the kindle edition of \\"[[ASIN:B000JQU1VS The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]].\\"    I found this ebook to be a great download (my first one actually). It does have an active \\"table of contents\\" that has worked well on my Kindle 3. The only problem I have noticed is that every once-in-awhile a typo crops up.    This collection of Sherlock Holmes short stories make for quick but highly enjoyable reads. Perfect for a relaxing lunch hour or a half-hour sanity break during a long day. Each adventure is very much to the point yet gives little glimpses into the life and character of Holmes and Doctor Watson. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle adds a lot of color within a less-is-more framework that I really admire.    I highly recommend this ebook!

B000NSJ4Q0|3.0|I shoot a lot of roller derby, and these work great with my 580 flashes-- doing everything as advertised.  My problem with them is that I purchased an older 540 flash, and when used with that flash they over heated and stopped working. So, if you choose to hunt down an older flash, be careful when using these packs. I sent my packs to canon to be repaired, but they said that they don't repair accessories.  So, be warned. These rock with the 580, but in my experience will fry your 540 very quickly.  Aside from that issue, you can put one of these on your flash and shoot like crazy for hours.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|I finally saw this movie after all these years, and it was worth it.

0761119752|5.0|Sandra's books have been my daughter's favorite since she was just a few months old. She is now 2 years old and she always circles back to Sandra Boynton!
B004EAQNO4|3.0|This is a not too gory but still frightening horror thriller which, while not well acted for the most part, is watchable and unpredictable. A group of people are trapped in an elevator and one of them is the devil himself, though you can't really figure out who it is. That's the thing, right?  The idea is that the devil could be among you, or any evil force, for that matter, and it could look like anybody.<br /><br />Not great but not bad.
1416972242|5.0|In this story, a young teenager named Clary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see the others: Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries?<br />Clairy has a friend, a normal mortal, called Simon. He keeps her feet on the ground and levels out the differences between the normal world and the paranormal world.<br /><br />It was thrilling to read a story of a teenage girl meeting characters of a different world, a world that you normally  don't see. The characters are believable and the adventures are thrilling.
1569242739|5.0|While most of this book is exotic and insane, I feel that is exactly how it should be. You aren't supposed to make cupcakes every day, or every week. The ideas in here are amazing. I wish I could try every single one.<br /><br />Here's what I have done (All with spectacular success.)<br /><br />- Cookies n' Cream Cupcakes. This is arguably the most phenomenal cupcake recipe of all time. The almond extract and chopped cookies IN THE BATTER are what truly makes this to die for. And every other aspect of the recipe I guess. I could gush over these for days.<br />- S'mores Cupcakes. They don't taste a damn thing like s'mores but they're interesting, different, and delicious nonetheless.<br />- Coconut Lime Cupcakes. Are you drunk? Are you at a party? Is it July? Well, friends, here is the snack for you. Delicious sober as well but I mean I'm just saying. These are so perfect. Everyone will love you if you bring these by.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with the basic recipes either, chocolate on chocolate or vanilla or whatever. I wish I had more excuses, more time, and more money to make everything in this book. Excellent all around.
1601251831|5.0|Quality gaming book. No glaring spelling/grammar errors throughout like you used to find in WoTC products. Paizo is a good company that makes quality products.
B004EJ14V2|1.0|I wish I had seen a couple more 1 star reviews so I wouldn't have wasted my time.  There is no real content or substance to this movie.  I wanted to laugh but saw only stupidity.  Don't watch.
0670019933|1.0|Not as advertised.  These copies are remaindered and are marked on the bottom as such with a felt-tip line.  I had purchased this as a gift but was unable to give it due to the remaindered marking.  The online information about these books fail to mention their remaindered status.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this is probably my new favorite book. collins has a way of capturing your mind as your swept away in a triumphant battle of survival. she keeps you enticed, earning for more. i would recommend this book for any type of reader from the casual reader to the avid readers. well done
B003R0LBVW|4.0|The book was well worth the $$ and time to read.  It was thought provoking, and sad, and beautiful.  Definitely recommend it...
B0045VZSB6|5.0|Works fine. Arrived in a timely fashion. In perfect shape. No complaints. Eight more words are required for this and I don't have any.
B002VECM6S|5.0|very happy that amazon priced this dvd same as any retail store as a black friday promo.  great handling and delivery by amazon. very much like amazon's free super saver delivery
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I love this DVD collection! As a big fan of \\"Grey's Anatomy\\", I was really impressed with everything with htis collection!!!! Highly recommend it for any \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" fan!
B00447G29S|5.0|Let me start by saying that this was our first time to see this movie. We are agressively searching for 3D Bluray movies for our new 3D sets. We were thoroughly impressed with the effects and sound of this movie. We highly recommend this 3D Bluray.
0316019984|5.0|I bought this book for my 5 year old godson, and he absolutely loved it. He is a big superhero fan, and he flipped when he saw it.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I have only the most basic cable TV, so didn't see this when it was first broadcast. My son bought me the DVD set for Christmas, and 2 days later, I've watched the whole thing.<br /><br />Everyone involved has done a superb job. First-rate acting by both men and women, good writing, passionate directing, special effects whose realism is sometimes shocking, and always sobering, and live sets in Australia (close enough to the islands being fought over to have a real feel of authenticity) made for engaging story-telling with the feel of truth, and that's what a first-rate film production should do.<br /><br />This series feels true to the experience of the Marines it portrays. I've read both Sledge and Leckie, and the series seems very much in line with their experiences, physically and emotionally.<br /><br />World War II in the Pacific was truly a naval war (the Marines are part of the Navy), and I'm still waiting for a treatment of equal quality for the shipboard part of the conflict. My Dad was a Navy fighter pilot who flew 45 combat missions from the deck of the U.S.S. Lexington in the summer and fall of 1944, until the ship was disabled by a Kamikaze. He was awarded numerous decorations, including the Navy Cross, and his squadron performed admirably, but like the Marines in this HBO series, their exploits have largely faded into oblivion, as have the experiences of so many others who fought against Japan. The Pacific story has definitely gotten the short end of the stick in terms of popular knowledge and awareness, so perhaps this series, along with Clint Eastwood's excellent films of the Iwo Jima experience, will begin to redress that imbalance.<br /><br />My only complaint is a quibbling technical one about aircraft configuration, but this isn't a series about the air war in the Pacific, so I'll let it slide.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Although this can stand alone as a singular movie, the impact is greater when taken with the first 2 in the series. The surprise villain (who knew teddy bears could be so evil?) was one of this year's baddest of the bad. And grown men actually cried towards the end. There was so much humor and connectedness (I think that's a word) that made this another Pixar movie that reached beyond animation. The warmth and the toys are all there with an almost \\"The Lady or The Tiger\\" ending. This is a keeper.<br />Haven't been able to view all the extras on my blu-ray edition but you can get just the movie.
B003EYVXTG|1.0|The first time in a long time I ejected a film because it had NO entertainment value on any level what ever. In a world of unimaginably bleak poverty in back woods America, a teenage girl is trying to save her fatherless family with a Mother who is completely mentally debilitated from being evicted from their hovel trailer. As this fun started, I watched her roam from one shanty to the next looking for her drug dealing meth head father to get some money. Obviously everyone who has met him hates him and fears the law to the point that a group of relatives beat her half to death in an attempt to stop the girls desperate search.<br />  I had enough at that point. Yes, I am great-full my lot in life is better than that. But I take no joy in watching non-stop suffering and misery on that level. No fun at all.<br /><br />  BTW.  I skipped Misery completely.  'nuff said.  JPF
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I'm not going to write a long review, just wanted to give my two cents.  I absolutely loved this series.  As someone who is a fan of Band of Brothers and teaches a WWII high school course, I was looking forward to The Pacific for a long time and was not let down.  It is very different than Band of Brothers, to be sure, but I thought it did an excellent job of personalizing a part of WWII that many don't understand or place as second fiddle to the European theatre.  It is brutally haunting and depressing at times, but the series places the viewer right alongside the soldier and gives a glimpse into their lives and psyche.  Hopefully this series will go a long way toward recognizing what those who served in the Pacific gave to fight in WWII.
B003PIUC02|5.0|for the guys:Blood, gore, and lots of ass kicking...lots of tits and ass.  for the girls: great story... love stuff, and a whole lot of near naked ripped guys.  BEST SHOW EVER!!!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Love the series Sons of Anarchy! Amazon.com GREAT!!! Not only help you get your iteam at the best price, they are also VERY good at giving you updates on your item!
B002ZG999U|4.0|oh this was just fun. And some moments I just like seeing again. A bunch of old guys (and some not that old) behaving like they are 10-30 years younger. Fun, don't ask too many questions, get the popcorn...sigh...<br />More of a rental though.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This is the most realistic series that I have ever seen.  The gathering of WWII uniforms and weaponry along with all the other associated equipment was so well done I thought I was there and in many cases glad I survived the battles.  However, the blue ray dvd did not contain the previews given on each episode of actual battlefield footage and comments by veterans who were there.  Since I had already seen the episodes on HBO I spent a lot of time explaining to my wife what had been presented on HBO when watching the blue ray dvd.  I would think anyone who had not seen the series on HBO would be inclined to give a lesser review to the blue ray edition.  Not to take away from what is presented here, this has got to be the best WWII series ever made.  I also have Band of Brothers and am in arguments which series is best.  The Pacific gets my vote, but I can understand the differences in opinion.
B003ZJJFKE|3.0|This latest album, as with Satriani's last effort, leave's me wondering if these latest albums have been put together for contractual obligations.  I am a very big fan of Joe Satriani and always look forward to the latest releases of this spectacular guitar player. However, the sheen of \\"spectacular\\" seems to be fading. Along with Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Eric Johnston, and in particular Jeff Beck, there are few others worthy of the applause and coin one spends to hear them and see them play live. These guys play on another level (none better than Jeff Beck I must exclaim !) and it's a certain dissapointment when their new music does not reach expectations.  I feel that Joe's last two studio album's are rather forgetable and I am saddened to have come to this conclusion, but must make comparison to Joe's entire catalouge and to the expansive limits that he has played.  I have seen Joe live many times and his tour through Toronto at Massey Hall a year or so ago was also rather forgetable.  So much so in fact, that I decided to not bother getting tickets to his most recent concert in December this year.(late 2010 anyway). One has to wonder if Joe has run out of inspirational and other-wordly music...his efforts with Chicken Foot would seem to mirror this conclusion.
B0049VZ222|5.0|It can be hard to find good zombie material.  This series was great, highly recommend it.  Can't wait for season 2.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I have purchased each of the Twilight saga DVD's.  Of the three, I think Eclipse was the best by far.  I enjoyed the footage of the surrounding mountains and how it was actually filmed.  The book story line was also well represented in the third installment of the twilight series.  I felt that the first two movies deviated too much from the actual books, but understood that it was necessary to trim the book story line to keep the movie, age appropriate and within a suitable time frame.  All in all, one of my favorites movies.  I wished that the screen writers had not put so many foul words in Jacob's mouth this time around.  It was not necessary for the plot and seemed to cheapen the storyline.  Not every werewolf needs to use foul language to get their point across.  Leave the cheap language out of the next two movies.  Only weak writing needs to use this type of language to carry the storyline.  I was not happy at all that I made an advance purchase of the Eclipse movie before it's release, but did not receive it until several days after the release date.  Because of this, I will never purchase a newly released movie or book from Amazon.  I will go to my local merchant and fight the lines in order to have the item on the first day of the release.  In the past, since I work for the Postal Service, I knew that Amazon sent the \\"to be released\\" materials out to the Post Office to be delivered on the release date.  Even though this made me nervous, I enjoyed serving my customers through Amazon by being able to deliver their item directly to their waiting hands on the day it was released.  I hate that this practice has been discontinued.  It was a great service for those who live in rural areas and can not afford to travel to a store in order to purchase the item on the original release date.  If I had been aware of this fact, I would not have ordered from Amazon.  And I am a loyal customer of Amazon.  Too bad!  I will be purchasing the last two installments at my localstore.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|Keeping to the traditional \\"the sequel is never as good as the original\\" rule, this follow-up gives us plenty of Robert Downey JR (which is a good thing) but now he's mostly annoying. Gwenyth's character is, well, what happened to her? She is not the same. Scarlett is quite good and Mickey is very watchable. But, it's just not the same. It is, of course, marvelous in blu-ray. If you already own the superior first movie, this would be okay to buy but I'd advise renting it first.
B0006ZE7G2|1.0|I can not watch the film as it is the wrong regional code.I do not recollect any instructions regarding this when ordering this, i live in UK and would have thought my region would have been known.  Paul Weller                    Pink Floyd The Wall.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|Worth the $ spent. Longtime skeleton swatch fan. Lots of compliments and well built. All three hands glow when exposed to light. No reference marks for #'s on dail execept for tiny dots for 12 3 6 & 9 on bezel. Did have to have a couple of links removed from band for a better fit done by any jeweler. Even the back of the watch is transparent. Very cool and would buy again.
0316098337|3.0|Bought the book for my 95 yr. old mother who happens to be an avid reader.  Can't actually give a great review as I haven't read it.  Hopefully, she will share!  THanks
B0007OY2P8|1.0|I was fully prepared for a less than stellar production based on the reviews here but was stunned at just how bad this version really is. Instead of portraying Cathrine's youthful fantasy through EVO or a dream sequence that made sense, they make her imaginings seem like those of a psycotic involving all of those around her. The actress seems incapable of smiling and spends much time with what appears to be a smirk on her face. The lack of an abbey has been noted before as well as the shortcomings of the soundtrack so I won't add to those complaints. The acting was poorly done. I don't know if that is because these are not good actors or they were being badly directed. What was offered did follow Austen's work but was too abbreviated to do it justice.<br /><br />I would suggest buying the more expensive version even though it is even shorter. It can't be worse.
0670034711|5.0|Good product, arrived promptly.<br />I preferred the movie over the book; there was less time for all of the author's philosophizing and theologizing--she purports to have found all the knowledge she was looking for!
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|This is an amazing film. The script is air tight. The acting is truly convincing. The cinematography is great in that it encompasses the darker, more sinister story perfectly. The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is matched perfectly throughout the film. Totally immersive and intriguing. Wouldn't be surprised if this film receives Best Picture at the Oscars.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|This review is to praise the prompt service and excellent price by the seller.  The price was better than any others listed.  The DVDs were delivered within a couple of days of me placing the order.  I was completely satisfied.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Set in a post-apocalyptic world where the State of Panem sends two teens from each of its twelve districts to a gladiator-style \\"game\\" where they must fight to the death, Suzanne Collins brings us a book that defies all gender limitations. Boys and girls alike will be fascinated by this novel. It's brutal, intriguing, and not too flowery; that is, boys won't be too bored by clothes descriptions and girl problems, despite the fact that the protagonist, Katniss, is a girl. In this fight to the death, Katniss befriends the boy that is sent to the games with her, a young man named Peeta. Even though only one person is allowed to leave the games alive, Katniss and Peeta struggle to protect each other. It is this relationship that is the only downside to the whole story; the romance that Collins tries to portray is unnecessary and almost unrealistic for two teenagers. However, I was enthralled by Collins's gruesome tale of murder and chaos in her new world of Panem, and recommend this to both teens who need something to read and to parents who remember books like The Giver and 1984.
030726999X|5.0|The book was in excellent condition.  I had waited for it on the waiting list at my library for months.  I got tired of waiting but didn't want to pay full price for it.  It was in such good condition, I donated it to the library afterward.
0142410349|5.0|Fantastic Mr. Fox is the sort of book that every well-read child should own. It bears up wonderfully under repeat readings and is the sort of story that is just begging to be read out loud. Dahl is one of a very small group of children's authors who basically never misfire. I would steer clear of his adult books, but anything he wrote for children is pure gold, from Danny The Champion Of The World to Fantastic Mr. Fox or James And The Giant Peach.<br />Fantastic Mr. Fox is a richly charactered tale of community and family and food. The food! Apple cider and goose and chickens, and who can forget the doughnuts stuffed with liver? Thankfully, we, the readers, do not have to eat those doughnuts. At any rate, I won't ruin the story by letting you in on the plot, other than to say, how can you go wrong with a story about animals and digging and food and outwitting three nasty farmers? If you do purchase the book and are unhappy with your read, get in touch with me and I'll apologize profusely (but I really don't think that's going to happen).
B003TSEL7S|4.0|The Lost Hero is very exciting if you are looking for an adventure story. My only complaint is that it is a little confusing in the begining. When I first read The Lost Hero, I was confused and had to ask my brother what was going on. Other than that the story was great. An action packed well writen story lots of people will love.
B00005NTJK|4.0|Wonderful compilation, a must for any Jethro T lover. I lost this CD (or had my daughter swiped it?)In any case, I am glad to have it back. Iam Anderson's flute soars, Martin Barre's guitar is never over-played and the writing is strong through-out. Enjoy! <joe S December '10>
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community is a wonderfully quirky sit-com with relatable characters. It's great to see how the show develops over it's first season. Abed and Troy are the new Hope & Crosby! The show takes risks, pays homage to pop-culture and still manages to be consistently funny. Enjoy!
1440503257|5.0|I gave this for a gift to a close friend who is a real Harry Potter \\"geek\\".  The feedback was terrific.  My friend spent hours reviewing each recipe and revisiting the places the foods were made in the Harry Potter movies.  Even though I'm not as much of a Potter fan, I thought the idea and content were great!  It made me want to try to make the various dishes.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|As soon as I saw thw cover I was like BORING! I read the first chapter and I learned my lesson, never jugde a book by its cover. Rick Riordan has done it again! Another wonderful book by the one and only Rick. Anyone who like greek gods and laughing READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!! Do it now! Now I say, NOW!
B0016UNG18|2.0|This is one of the best Wings recording - I especially like Picasso's Last Words - Richard Cory. But all I have is the original scratched up album my sister bought in '77. Why can't I purchase the mp3s from Amazon. C'mon!
B0029SCFE0|5.0|Man, this movie was crazy. It's all over the place. It has one of the best fighting scenes ever too.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|I bought this as a gift for my cousin for Christmas. When he tried to take the disc out of the DVD case the DVD snapped in half. He's 10 so he isn't particularly strong but DVD's generally don't break that easily.
B00005JKG5|5.0|This is the second copy of this movie that I've purchased from Amazon. The first copy went away with my ex-wife, this one stays with me. The dancing is terrific, Beals is incredibly gorgeous and talented, very easy on the eye. The dancing super. The dog is a supurb actor as well. For me it is a feel good movie, full of hope, asperation, and art. It does belong in a perminant collection.
B003XQM2YU|4.0|it's funny, if you try to figure out if it's a good movie based on reviews (especially the ones that have bitter diatribes)then you will be misled. If you like the director and producer's work on other movies and you like the cast and your looking for a medieval story that goes as much on historial presentation as well as dramatic story lines then this is a fine movie to watch in my opinion.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|I first saw Jason Mraz on the Palladia channel and really liked him so I ordered the cd.  I have not been disappointed at all like you are sometimes when you purchase cds.  His lyrics are very cool and the music rocks!!  I am very glad I made this purchase.
0385504225|2.0|I have read all Dan Brown's book now but \\"The LOst SYmbol, its the worst of all ! Its feels like a religious brainwashing with 200 unnecessary pages ! A complete disappointment.
031603438X|5.0|This is the greatest, most important rock-and-roll memoir.  Why?  Because it is written by an insider, a moral insider, of the Rolling Stones.  The gloss is off Mick Jagger now, and I always liked Mick better . . . until now.  The truth's out, Mick, and you can accuse Keith of lying for money all you want, but one page of this book is enough to show any fair reader Keith is telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, in his inimitable style.  I have a new hero, and you need to stop reading this review and buy the book now.    In my opinion, this memoir, which is exceedingly well written, is the most important thing Keith Richards has ever done, bringing his accomplishments to another level entirely, which is staggering.
1423113381|5.0|This was a fun and easy read! Totally worth having a peek. If you enjoyed the Fablehaven series, Persey Jackson, and Harry Potter, this is a book for you.  Okay, not the best in terms of literary writing, but non-the-less, its a good journey to dive into.  I look forward to the next books.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Product was exactly as described. Arrived quickly.  Arrived in Good Condition. Has not been viewed as yet.  He wants to keep it as a Collectible. (Factory Sealed). Will order from this Vendor again. Very Satisfied.
B00004CWO8|1.0|A big dissappointment: I expected powerful male dancing as for example Jorge Don delivered in Maurice Bejar's choreography of a Swan solo in the 70's- but instead the male corp dances like Dude's neighbor in the \\"Big Lebowski\\". Thuddy hairy amateurs costumed in lamb skin.  Riding pants hopping about doing hump backed arabesques. The Prince is a jazz dancer doing ballet steps.  The women involved in the court scenes are real ballet soloists and the only honest dancing in the production. Without the strong hype and art-political support this production received on opening this \\"Mutton Lake\\" would have been dismissed out of hand as tacky twaddle.
B002T921AC|5.0|I don't know why there are so many haters out there, but this is a GREAT CD! And his next CD, My World 2.0 is 10 times better! So buy both- you'll love it ;) Some people say he sounds like a girl, but in my opinion I never thought that until I heard other people talking about how they thought that's how his music sounds. I just wish this CD had more songs! But the next one has way more.
0545265355|4.0|I know I'm a little behind the game on this series, just getting it into my reading now, but it was worth the wait.     Katniss lives in the 12th district, the poorest district there is, with her mother and her sister, Prim. She sneaks out under the fences during the day to poach in the forest for food to eat and trade with her friend, Gale. They support their families and keep from starving, but the consequenses of being caught could be deadly.    The day of the Reaping is here. The Reaping is the day two children, a boy and a girl ages 12-18, from each of the 12 districts are chosen to participate in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are a deadly showdown forcing the children to fight for their lives. There can be only one winner....the last one left alive. Katniss is shocked when her sister is selected from the list to participate and quickly volunteers to take her place.    In the Capitol she is prepared for the games with her fellow selection from district 12, a boy named Peeta. They strike up an unusual friendship that Katniss is scared will only interfere with her winning the game so she can return to her family. Once the game starts she strikes out on her own, hoping to outlast the other contestants. But the gamemakers seem to be forcing her to make a decision. A decision between her life or the life of Peeta. After all, there is only one winner.    This book may sound gory and bloody and rather harsh. Parts of it are, but not so much that it took away from the tale of Katniss discovering who she is and who she can be. She learns the meaning of friendship and trust, compassion and revenge, and above all, what sacrifice really means.    The other contestants in the game are written in a way that they stand out as individuals, but not so much that they take away from the characters of Katniss and Peeta. I'm looking forward to continuing to story to see what the gamemakers have in store.    4/5
B0015DROBO|5.0|I have absolutely no complaints about this book. I'm not the craziest of readers, but it is extremely well written and will definitely give you chills at one point or another. However, I think the entire world knows that now :)
1449979688|4.0|This is a really nice book, but it's much bigger than it looks.  Check the dimensions before you buy.

0679746323|3.0|This book provides a great deal of interesting information, unfortunately almost every paragraph in its 700 pages reveals an overpoweringly animus against Mao, a bias so unremitting and focused that, in the end, I feel it ultimately undermines its credibility.<br /><br />The book's uncritical and focused attack is not just unfortunate in marring what is in many ways a very worthwhile and thought-provoking book, but even more importantly, in establishing what most people have acknowledged for many years, that Mao is one of the most vilainous individuals in history.<br /><br />There are also some disturbing subtexts to this book.<br /><br />Mao did many, many terrible things, but it seems the authors were not content with his truly sanguinary record, they evidently feel the need to pile, heap, and blame almost every imaginable catastrophe that occured in China between the years 1894 and 1976 (Mao's lifetime) on Mao, Stalin, or the Communists.<br /><br />Here's an example that really surprised me: according to the authors, Mao and the communists are the true culprits behind Japan's attack on Shanghai and Nanjing in 1937.<br /><br />I find this extremely difficult to believe, both in terms of plain logic or historical evidence.<br /><br />The authors claim that a Nationalist Chinese army commander, Zhang Zhizhong, was actually a communist 'mole', who deliberately provoked the Japanese into attacking the central Chinese region of the Yangtze valley, under direct orders from Moscow, so as to draw the Japanese into an endless struggle, pulling their forces and resources farther and farther away from the Soviet Union's border's, and thereby relieving Stalin from the threat of a two-front struggle against Germany and Japan.<br /><br />If we even accept the premise of a Chinese provocation at Shanghai in 1937, how would this automatically lead to a complete reversal of Japan's geo-strategical direction?<br /><br />Why would the actions of a local Chinese commander, a meaningless pinprick to the Japanese military machine, derail Tokyo's plans?<br /><br />A simple punitive action would have sufficed, as it had in the past.<br /><br />The authors provide no evidence at all from the Japanese to support this surprising claim.<br /><br />But, admittedly, presenting evidence (or logic) is rarely a concern of the authors, because they are so bent, in such a frenzied hurry to dump an avalanche of crimes on Mao and the Communists.<br /><br />Also, are the authors trying to exculpate the Japanese from blame for the 1937 attack?<br /><br />It's interesting that the authors say nothing about the terrible war crimes and massacres perpetrated by the Japanese.<br /><br />It wasn't the Japanese'fault, they were 'forced' into dropping bombs on defenceless cities, use biological warfare, celebrate competitive human decapitation,perform gruesome medical experiments?<br /><br /> How can they seriously blame Mao or the communists for this?<br /><br />The authors perform ingenious logical acrobatics (or simply remain silent, as is the case with the Russo-Japanese War of 1938-1939) in order to push their view, which evidently, can be boiled down as:<br /><br />Mao=BAD<br />Communists=BAD<br />Stalin=Bad<br /><br />Chiang=Good<br />Nationalists=Good<br />Japanese=OK<br /><br />Ironically, just as Chiang and Mao are blamed for ignoring the Japanese threat because they were hypnotized in mutual hate of each other, the authors of this book, hypnotized by their hatred of Mao (which, I repeated is to a great extent, justified), diminish their believability by making too many startling claims with too little evidence.
B0014Z4ON4|1.0|Raiders was great.  LC was great.  Temple is flat out terrible.  Just a ridiculous and poorly done movie.
B002ZG981E|5.0|The Blu Ray picture quality and sound is amazing.  This was a very enjoyable movie, and if you pay attention, you will understand it.  Don't think too much when watching it, just try to believe.  It's the only way this movie works.  Leo puts on an excellent performance, and the supporting cast are all great as well.      This set comes with a digital copy of the movie.  As of December 2010, the package I received said the digital copy offer expires on May 6, 2011.  If you own a copy of this movie, be sure to obtain your digital copy before the offer expires.  If you are purchasing this and want the digital copy, make sure to verify with Amazon, or on the back of the package when the digital copy offer expires.  I highly recommend this movie!
B0043GAZYS|5.0|im really satisfied with this blu-ray edition.not only it comes with a DVD,the blu-ray must have been about 6hours long,if not more.if im not mistaken theres 2 90min extra and another 45min feature with tons of trailers and TV spots,music specials and lots of commentary with the cast and writers.
1593272774|1.0|This was one of our son's worst Christmas gifts.  He is 9 and LOVES legos.  He can build legos designated for 12 year olds in just a couple of hours.  He has gone to Lego Engineering camps and loved every project.  I thought this would be perfect for my budding engineer, but even his father, who is an engineer, couldn't figure out this book.      Our biggest complaint is that there are hundreds of SIMPLE MACHINES pictured, but there is no parts list and no step by step diagrams.  The \\"directions\\" are comprised of photos of the finished \\"machine\\" from a couple of different angles.  The worst thing according to my son is that he has no idea what these machines are meant to do.  Initially when we opened it, I thought it was showing us components to a bigger machine.  Nope.  A whole \\"machine\\" might be only 8 lego pieces, and have no discernible purpose.    I thought he would be taught to build pulleys or small cranes or ANYTHING that he could imagine playing with once built.  Even some of the bigger \\"machines\\" gave no clue about what they were actually for.    I wish I could figure out how to post pictures of a few of the \\"Machines\\" so you could understand what I mean.  If you go to \\"Search Inside this Book\\" and then \\"Surprise Me\\" you can go to pictures of the pages 89-93.  This is a perfect example of what I am referring to.  Each SEPARATE \\"MACHINE\\" is in a grey box.  These are not separate steps to build something, these are each different \\"machines\\" and we have no idea what any of them might be built for.
B001VNB54A|5.0|If you loved Band of Brothers you will find this series very good.  It is an awesome tale about the Marines in the Pacific during WWII told through their eyes.
1577314808|5.0|The book it is at  least as better as I expected or even more.For those interested in espiritual things it is quite good. And I received in less time than amazon estimated it would be. thanks very much.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|This movie is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know it doesn't exactly follow the graphic novel but how many movies do?  Lots of quotable lines here. I've sampled quite a few of them. So looking at this as a standalone movie you won't be disappointed. Don't expect non-stop action though, There is a story here. So the captain recommends you buy it. It's a nice addition to any Blu-Ray collection. Also check out the Natalie Portman extra. I was cracking up. The captain says \\"make it so\\"
B0042GIRYE|5.0|I saw this band on some music awards show and they made me sit up and listen. They performed the song \\"I'm Falling In Love While She's Walking Away\\" and nothing else I heard that night even came close to matching the virtuosity, feeling and warmth (who says warmth anymore?) of that performance. So I downloaded the album and was even more astounded to hear thirteen more songs of the same caliber. \\"Knee Deep\\" is actually a song about me and keeps me smiling until the last chord. \\"Cold Hearted\\" is about all of us at some point in our lives. The vocals are all sweet and the harmonies are the best since the Everly Brothers. The musicianship is top drawer and they seem to be able to create any mood they want. This album is without a doubt the best thing I've heard this year.
B001992NUQ|5.0|I bought the two-disc special edition dvd when it came out (10 years ago!) and devoured it: film, commentaries, extras, everything. With this blu-ray edition, there are a few new extras but what I've only had time for (and the primary reason I'd ever want it) is for the film itself. In high definition, Fight Club is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Great detail, a boost in depth, color and blacks (especially the blacks) and the audio tracks are perfect. All of the supplemental material from the previous release is carried over. I've only watched one of the new extras (where Fincher, Norton and Pitt recently accepted an award for the film and quoted negative reviews; they're introduced by Mel Gibson on a horse?!) but not a lot of new material is needed or wanted. The full package was already there. Very affordable and one of the best blu-ray releases EVER.
B0044X5EYQ|5.0|If you are fan of Jamiroquai -- especially the last album, you should buy this album without hesitation.      I read the one review trashing Jay Kay in a variety of ways -- for an apparent \\"blow\\" addiction and for falling short of funk geniuses such as James Brown, the Meters etc . . . .   That guy really misses the point.  Though Jamiroquai is a funky band, you obviously can't compare them to the funk greats of the seventies.  It would actually do them a real disservice.  They have a modern sound, routed in funk and disco, but it's unique.  They're not trying to sound like the masters of the past -- thank God -- there are enough bands that do that.      If you are a lover the band and their unique sound -- than this album will not disappoint.  This album builds off of Dynamite and expands on the sound of that album.  It has moments that are more rockin than a typical jamarioquai album, for example, on the title track.  Some really sick classic Jamiroqaui funk/disco tune, and there are also two beautiful slow pretty songs (\\"Blue Skies\\") and (\\"Never Gonna Be Another\\").      This is a great album folks.  Great writing.  Superior musicianship.  Jay Kay delivers his use stellar work.  Highly recommend.  A no-brainer if you're a fan . . . .
B0033QC0WY|5.0|In my opinion the most reliable set of recording of Mahler's Symphonie circle.  Three great orchestras, known for their Mahler interpretation, great solists, and Bernstein at his best.
030746363X|5.0|I've read most of the book now, flipping forwards and backwards to various chapters. I've really enjoyed it.     I find it quite different from the other diet & exercise books I've read. Things that come to mind - it is inspiring, straight forward, rational, practical, DOABLE. It is refreshingly without the usual fevered salesmanship, hype, and hysterical nonsense found in most books and programs dealing with the subject.    I appreciate Tim Ferris' approach, the way he deconstructs things into parts, the popular concepts he challenges, the experts he sought, his obsessive self testing. His perspective on the knowledge and information he's learned and his conclusions about it all are refreshing and motivating.    In reading this book, you get the benefit of his many years obsession with understanding what it takes to dramatically influence the state of the human body with the minimum amount of effort necessary - without having to become obsessed about it yourself! (Thanks for writing it Tim!)    I've already put lots of the stuff he talks about into practice and am experimenting with others. I can tell you, the stuff works and is real.     It's a cool book. This information can change your life in important ways.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I love this film. It would definitely make my top 20 if not top 10. And there is a lot to love about this blu-ray release and some nitpicks as well. The 72 year-old film (as of this posting) has been well preserved but at times there are moments of softness and flickering in the image, especially in the first half of the film (like the early banquet scene that Robin Hood party-crashes). It's not abundant throughout the film but it is noticeable in the brief shots where it occurs. Otherwise, stellar presentation. The Ultra Resolution restoration process produces great detail and vibrant colors (Olivia De Havilland looks delicious in high-def). Just as good are the extras from the standard dvd edition, all of which have been ported (the two Looney Tunes cartoons - both Robin Hood themed - are in high def!). Very cheap and highly recommended!
B001N18HOQ|5.0|Although I do not understand the utility of repeating the same songs on the first CD in the second, for the rest of this deluxe edition of the first great album of Pearl Jam is very well made: the unplugged concert has been remastered very well both in audio and in videos, and even the CDs are ok. The booklet made by singer Eddie Vedder and bassist Jeff Ament is not bad.<br />The only flaw in the music album for me is the arrangement of the beautiful song \\"Black \\", the first part, more relaxed, in the usual training sees the addition of keyboards, which gives it a 80s pop sound too for my taste, and in the second part of the backing vocals of bassist and guitarist I do not like that much.<br />For the rest of the band is perfect and had already reached maturity: the bass player in particular I love the perfect way to play his various types of bottom: fretless, 8 string and \\"normal\\" is the singer Eddy is great as usual in the texts in the voice, the drummer is one of the best the band has ever had<br />and guitarist sunny even better than usual<br />I can also say that they are the only group that I like was born and lived after the end of the '70s.<br />LONG LIFE TO PEARL JAM!
B001DCQI8W|5.0|Karajan was 65 years old when he started this project, and his style at that time had matured. For me the ripest interpretation of the Bruckner Symphonies available.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This movie is just too cute.  My three sons all love it although of different age groups and we adults love it too because it does have some adult humor, but always appropriate.  Its a great family movie, and on amazon, its a great value!
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|While Speilberg and Hanks are to be commended for bringing the Pacific Theatre portion of World War II to us, the series was dissapointing, especially after reading the compelling book by E.B. Sledge.  Band of Brothers was character driven.  We got to know the men and to care about them...I found none of that in The Pacific Series.  I would not watch this again.   I have watched Band of Brothers many, many times and always enjoy it.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|I'm still reeling from the final scenes so I don't have much to say other than this movie delivers one of the best \\"creature features\\" that I've seen in a long time. The acting was emotional and absolutely believable given the circumstances these townsfolk find themselves in.     Oddly enough, if you're a fan of AMC's The Walking Dead, you'll get a treat as at least 3 of the main actors find themselves cast in this movie. They all give riveting performances.     Long story short -- watch this movie.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This movie is awesome.  I had no desire to see the movie, but was in complete awe thru the whole movie.
B000MV9026|5.0|I have to admit that I bought this movie for myself, and make my kids love it :)  They really do love it too though. The toddlers love the music, and my bigger boy loves the character.  I love the music.  Its a great family movie, and it will be watched over and over!
0307387151|1.0|Let me begin by saying that I highly recommend Ian McEwan's \\"Amsterdam\\" and \\"Enduring Love.\\"  They are good works of literary fiction, well-written, and they make you think about a variety of issues.  It was easy for me to understand why \\"Amsterdam\\" won the Booker.    When \\"Atonement\\" was released, I immediately ordered it, looking forward to another good book from McEwan.  I was sadly disappointed.  How \\"Atonement,\\" in the words of Publishers Weekly, quoted above, \\"just failed to win the Booker this year\\"  is a mystery to me -- not that it didn't win, but that it was even short-listed for the Booker.  Maybe it was a year of mediocre books.  Or it made the short list because McEwan wrote \\"Amsterdam.\\"      It was difficult to believe that the same person who wrote those books wrote this one.  Perhaps if he had taken all the disparate elements and different stories in \\"Atonement\\" and used them to write three or four separate books, or even two separate books, those books would have had the cohesiveness and interest I found lacking in \\"Atonement.\\"  I just checked and \\"Amsterdam\\" was just over two hundred pages, \\"Enduring Love\\" under three hundred, while \\"Atonement\\" is close to four hundred pages (208, 272, and 368 pages, to be precise.)      I enjoy reading good fiction.  I don't care whether it comes in the form of long novels with complicated plots and numerous characters or short ones with few characters, like \\"Amsterdam.\\"  I liked the 2009 Booker Prize winner \\"Wolf Hall\\" very much, which is 640 pages and has many characters.  I did not like \\"Atonement\\"   The story and characters were just not engaging enough, not real enough, to care about, and there were gaps in the plot that made no sense.      Perhaps McEwan is at his best writing shorter novels.
1453624910|4.0|The slim volumn had a few short stories and art by fans included with each story.  I thought it was cool.  But as the whole volumn was only 100 pages I was disappointed.  I was expecting more.
0670020478|2.0|Wow, after seeing Ken Robinson's talks on Ted.com and Youtube, I expected more from this book.  I bought a copy for each of my sons, but after reading it, I will buy them something else.  The first few chapters are fine, as Robinson outlines what intelligence really is, and describes all of our senses and the creative process.  Even though I knew all of this, I hoped the book would go into greater depth of how the educational system or invidivuals can cultivate both intelligence and creativity in their myriad of forms.  Instead, he focused on far too many examples of famous people who found their element.  I started skimming over them, because they bored me and it felt like someone was hitting me over the head with a hammer to get a rather simple point across.  I also felt insulted the focus was exclusively on famous people finding their element, with the exception of the car salesman.  The entire middle section of the book frustrated the heck out of me.  While expounding the merits of adopting the right attitude to make our own luck, I almost laughed out loud. Robinson said he recovered from polio but a few kids died in the hospital.  Because he recovered from polio, he didn't play soccer but went on to become a brainiac in the field of education.  Oh my !  Did those poor kids who died not have the best attitude?  I mean, their luck obviously ran out :-  That whole \\"make your own luck\\" argument is a new age mantra that I thought was beneath Sir Ken Robinson.  We absolutely have to recognize that immensely large portions of our population do not have as much freedom of choice, based on socioeconomic disadvantages, and they are not all as resilient as the few examples dug up by authors.  He then goes on to talk about mentorship being a necessary ingredient to finding our element which further flies in the face of making our own luck with a great attitude, because not everyone finds mentors.  To suggest otherwise is just silly.  Many successful people who are doing what they love, will be the first to admit they were extremely lucky, that they received one or more lucky breaks along they way. And that they met one or two mentors along the way, who connected them with the right tribe or people.  But herein lies my greatest disappointment in this book.  Who says one has to be famous to be working in their element?  I literally skimmed over the last ten or so examples of famous people to make it to my beloved car salesman who takes pictures of surfers.  But it was too little, too late.  While I enjoyed Robinson's Afterword, I thought it was misplaced and came right out of the blue.  I felt he had to market this book with bubblegum examples of famous people and New Age platitudes, in order to fit a bit of his brilliance in the Afterword.  But it just came off disjointed and I don't feel we got the same man who's speeches are so effective.
0316066524|1.0|A minor talent--both as a philosopher and as a novelist--whose posthumous reputation among his admirers so far exceeds what the reality warrants that it verges on the surreal.  Look, this book has many amusing moments, and a few passages of genuine intellectual nimbleness, but as a whole it's only so-so, passably clever, often dreary and clumsy, and utterly lacking in aesthetic merit.
0451169514|4.0|After I started reading this book, I had trouble putting it down. At least through the first 1000 pages or so. Unlike a lot of people, I didn't have a problem with how the story actually ended. The mystical, cosmic hugeness at the end of the book was great in my eyes. I simply had a problem with how long it took when we finally reached the end. The flashback and forward is necessary for the story to work, and for the most part I enjoyed this technique, but basically reading every situation twice at the end of the book was a bit tiresome. The last 150 or so pages drug on for me and I had trouble sitting down with the book for more than 10 minutes at a time at that point. \\"It\\" was the first King story I had read outside of the Dark Tower series, and I absolutely love how he tied all of his stories together with those books. If the ending were a bit more succinct and wrapped things up a bit more quickly I would say this book is a perfect 5. As it stands, however, I would give it a 4.5 with the ending the only factor working against it.
0439023521|5.0|This is really a good book.  I love to have a book that I cannot wait to get back to.  This is one of them. I really cannot believe this is a \\"young adult\\" book because I'm over 50 and can't say enough good about it. I just finished it and am looking forward to tonight when I can start book 2.  Fast paced with suspense, sadness, humor and great dialogue.  If you like sifi or fantasy, you won't be disappointed.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I was in line in the bookstore to buy the Raymond Briggs book,\\" The Snowman.\\" An older woman came up to me and told me how I had to get the video--that it was absoutely wonderful. When I got the cashier, a very young guy, he echoed the lady and told me how his father had bought it for him as a child and that I had to get the video. Both these folks approached an absolute stranger to pitch this video. Well, gee. I got it. You have to trust that. It is absolute magic. Animation before computers. True to the book. Pure magic!
B0044WUQ3G|5.0|OK OK I'm really kinda shocked I actually liked this movie there is nothing really special or spectacular about it I mean really the main character is the snow but all in all great movie. it mostly plays on your fears (if you have them) of being trapped and fear of heights
0345505387|1.0|I am an avid Diana Gabaldon fan and I would read her grocery list before I would ever recommend this book.  Actually this is the first time I have ever wrote a review for a book because I am so upset over it.  Diana Gabaldon is a smart lady or else we would not have Outlander but what was she thinking with this novel.  As others have stated before.  1 The character's all have an Asian look to them.  2 Claire looks like Betty Boop   3 Very hard to tell who is who... they all look alike  4 Kenneth?  Who?  Are you serious?  It made no sense  5 The characters look different throughout the book    Very confusing reading this book.  I love Diana Gabaldon and I will give her this book as her \\"oops what was I thinking\\" book but I expect more out of you next time Diana and no more Lord John, enough is enough with him....
B004529NLG|5.0|I bought this for the 3D. It's one of the best, if not the best 3D blu-ray that I've seen. It's right up there with \\"Open Season\\", which is a bit different because it's animated. It's definitely the best non-animated 3D blu-ray that I've seen. The acting and plot are almost non existent. The dancing is phenomenal though. I'm not even a big fan of dance, and just bought this to watch a non-animation 3D blu-ray besides some stupid documentary. The dancing is extremely entertaining though. You can tell the film was shot with 3D in mind.<br /><br />The setting is also perfect to showcase 3D. Since the film is based in New York the outside scenes offer incredible depth. Also, the brightness doesn't at all look too low as it does on many 3D blu-rays. I watched for a reduction in brightness the whole time and really didn't notice it at all. Ghosting also never seemed to appear. Both the outdoor and indoor scenes have a great level of brightness. The outdoor scene of Alyson Stoner and \\"Moose\\" dancing is an incredible showcase of 3D and the brightness and color palette are incredible. This 3D blu-ray is a must have in your collection. There are no special features in 3D, which was a little disappointing. The 3D quality of the film and the dancing made up for it though.
0316789720|1.0|I purchased this book for a five year old and I still don't think she would find it at all interesting. I am not returning it because it's not worth my time and money.
B0045MPPJK|5.0|Even though Hip Hop's golden era is long over, once in a while someone helps to redefine rap.  This album is a great example of what happens when artists are willing to take risks in music.<br /><br />What first distinguishes Die Antwoord from other groups is their production, which is a hybrid of rap and electronic rave music.  Most of the tracks are produced by DJ Hi-Tek, with a few co-produced by the group's lead artist Ninja.  The other difference is the unique sound presented by Ninja and Yolandi Visser's South African accents, along with their high-energy delivery.<br /><br />If you have a system in your car, you'll love the lows on songs like \\"Fish Paste\\", an addictive diss track with plenty of NWA references for old school rap fans.  Ninja's a solid lyricist, and his material ranges from funny to dark, with Eminem-style ad libs.  The majority of the tracks are in English, with at least one song (Doos Dronk) entirely in Afrikaans.  The album concludes with the title song \\"$O$\\", a purely instrumental techno track produced by Hi-Tek.<br /><br />Most of the tracks from this album were offered as a free download on the Die Antwoord website back in 2009.  $O$ contains new music such as the 2010 track \\"Evil Boy\\", with guest artist Wanga rapping in the Xhosa language about ritual circumcision in South Africa.  If I had any complaint about this album, it's that they excluded the addictive Afrikaans track \\"Wat Pomp\\" featuring Jack Parow.<br /><br />$O$ is more an of an EP than a full-length LP, but it's a quality album from start to finish with no skits or weak filler.  A digital download of the album is only $5.00, less than what you'd pay for some combo meals.  So if you're looking for fresh new music, definitely treat yourself to a digital download of the album today.

B002ZG99NG|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and absolutely loved it.  It's one of those types of movies that really keeps you on the edge of your seat with an adrenaline rush.  Absolutely loved it in the theaters and knew right away I wanted to own it.<br /><br />When this combo pack came out I thought the idea was awesome and the price of all formats in 1 was a great deal (DVD, Digital and Blu-Ray).  I am hoping I can find more movies in this combo set.  Really versatile.<br /><br />The movie itself is a Boston-lover's dream.  It's packed with excitement from the first 5 minutes onward.  There are unexpected twists and turns and it's a good crime flick ... but in this one, you want the bad guys to win.  It blends history with fiction well and the viewer really gets a great feel of the struggle in \\"Charlestown\\".<br /><br />Hats off to Jeremy Renner and Ben Affleck for great performances and great chemistry on the set.  As a Red Sox fan, I loved when filming took place in \\"the Cathedral of Boston\\" (Fenway Park) and you really get true filming in the bowels of this classic ball park.  This set is filled with extras, and one of the extras has to do with how filming took place in Fenway Park.<br /><br />Just an all out great film.  Loved it.  I put the digital copy on my iPad to watch on trips, etc. and have both the Blu-ray extended cut with some extra scenes and the DVD.<br /><br />If you love a well done action flick with a little Irish Mob action ... you'll love this.  Twists and turns ... great stuff!
B002ZG99CC|5.0|My son was so excited to receive this movie!   I guess its a GREAT movie, no scratches, clean and works as new.
B003UBTX72|5.0|I was unable to put this down! What a fascinating book.  I was never a huge Stones fan... I love some of their music, but certainly not all of it. After reading this, I went and seached out some songs I was not aware of, and am looking at the music in a new light. Keith, I am so very glad you survived the turbulent times in your life! Your attitude is amazing! I am pulling for you! I feel like I really know and understand you through the book. I am so very glad I came across it. Highly recommended read!
B001VNB54A|2.0|The scenes of the action in the pacific are awesome. Some of them I almost couldn't believe except I knew they had gone to great lengths for accuracy. What those guys went through was pure hell. I do wish they would have spent more time on the battle scenes on Guadalcanal. They seemed to fly through that part. Their defeat there was one of the biggest turning points of the war for the Japanese, and lasted much longer than shown in the movie.     For the rest of the movie, I fast forwarded after 3/4 of the first DVD. Trying to watch those scenes that weren't actual fighting or showing something that caught my attention was brutal. To me they were mostly boring, with a few light comedic scenes thrown in.    2/10's of this show was AWESOME! with the fighting scenes.  2/10's of this show was alright with comic scenes and 1 or 2 of the telling points in the movie.  6/10's of the show was absolutely boring...and I mean boring too tears.
B003OJBWGK|1.0|As a \\"child of the 60's\\" & as a radio jock,I would say this would of been a half way decent garage band album,but that's about it.What is it with todays groups,are there no Heavy Hitter Producers around to take charge & has everyone forgot how to sing & write melodies??????????
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This is the best soundtrack I've heard in a long long time, Christina and Cher are the greatest.  Must Buy.
030746363X|5.0|I read Tim Ferriss' 4HWW last month and found it insightful.  When I saw this coming out I preordered it. I like the broad range of topics in the 4 Hour Body. Also the perspective it gives you on health and exercise from the bodybuilding community and from physicians. In order to be and stay healthy you need to constantly read whats out there and also change up your workouts.  He gave me many ideas on changing my diet and getting a better workout in less time. I did the complete P90X workout afew months ago.  It was great and delivered on its promises but man it took alot of time.  Tim Ferriss' ideas are worth a shot. Hey, if he is totally wrong what's the worse that can happen- you eat too much spinach or protein, you miss out on a bunch of bread or you spend too much time outside the gym.  Where do I sign up!  Get the book, for $14 it's a deal.
B0044E9LW6|5.0|As a Dio lover was excited to see this cd on Amazon for a reasonable price. Thanks
B003L20ICE|1.0|Very disappointing movie. Actually, the movie really sucked. Did anyone in production/creation of this movie ever meet a lesbian couple???? Apparently not... First, what's up with the flower-child dialogue? No one really talks like that; in California or anywhere else. Right on?? I guess someone was trying to follow a stereotype of granola, crunchy, non-confrontational lesbians...? I didn't see any Birkenstocks though... hmmm... the rest of the dialogue was meaningless fluff... it was impossible to care about any of the characters since they were so poorly created. And since when do lesbians watch gay male porn?? Are you kidding me??? And of course, one of them HAS to have sex with a man...  Don't waste your time.
B004FEWYXS|5.0|MJ has always put his heart and soul into his music. I probably wasnt even born yet when Thriller came out in 1984 (which I was born in march of that year). Anyway I really enjoyed this one. This was way better than Invincible. If you read the lyrics as the songs play, you can really understand where he's coming from. Out of the 10 tracks I like 9 of them. I really didnt feel the track with Lenny Kravitz all that much. Behind the Mask...great just great, the saxophone player and the lady at the end gave me goosebumps. Overall I enjoyed this album.

B000SJVVZQ|4.0|as far as the abum description was concerned, it was described honestly.  We have not had the chance to play it yet, but I trust it wil work.  The misunderstanding was in the shipping department.  It did not arrive in the amount of time given for media mail due to a wrong address, but this seller was more than wiling to accommodate during the holidays.  Stellar actions on his part!
B004DRDD5A|5.0|This series is a one of a kind show with spectacular graphics. It's more grown up than the 2 Series before it, and brings the Stargate Lore to the forefront.

B0041VB8BO|5.0|one of the better albums i have ever listened to.  this is not a joke, or me being dramatic.  every song on here is upbeat, happy, and extremely catchy.  if that is your thing then enjoy.  this is usually not my thing, but this album is great.  the vocals alone are worth the try.  for 5 dollars this is a great thing.  o and see them live.  they might be the most engaging band i have ever seen.

B0021L8V0M|5.0|I never buy movies because I hate watching them twice but this time, I'm not only going to buy it, I'm going to buy a BLU-RAY version!    Too bad the sound track didn't engage me enough like the James Bond movies for me to go out and buy the soundtrack.    I very much look forward to a sequel!    I love how she's got a full range of emotions (tough, loving, makes up her own mind), and not like the heartless Bond Movies starring Daniel Craig.      --------------------  SIDE NOTE:     Angelina is also very beautiful.  I love how she helps the children of the world.  Lucky Brad Pit!  I also didn't like Brad Pit at first but have changed my mind after seeing that he committed himself to the children of the world with Angelina (I highly admire them for adopting kids).  Awesome job Angelina and Brad!!

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary does an outstanding job of bringing home the details of how a series of truly bad financial actors catalyzed the current (and still ongoing) financial crisis. Many of the specifics of this story will not be new to readers of the outstanding books on the financial crisis. However, to see all the threads of this story pulled together with such clarity and dramatic power is extremely bracing. Equally importantly, this documentary brings home another crucial point, which has previously been little understood. Some segments of academic \\"economics\\" have been bought by elite financial interests (through donations, speaking fess, rich consulting contracts, etc). The professional academy is supported by all of us (through massive tax-payer-funded government support of both public and private universities). Thus, this breach of trust is especially egregious. We have, tragically, come to expect our politicians to be prostitutes, but we should never tolerate whores in the academy. It will be of the greatest interest to see how (or, sadly, if) the economics profession moves to clean up its house. We should all see this documentary and have its message ever in mind as we listen to the dubious pronouncements of politicians and bought economists. Those who have criticized this important piece as \\"socialists\\" are either clueless or have some very narrow interests to protect - interests not confluent with most of the American electorate. If you want to be a part of taking back the American economy for most Americans (rather than the hyper-rich) this film is a must-see.<br /><br />Paul M.

B0036TGSIK|4.0|This genre has been saturated with utterly unwatchable films since the 80's.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  It's well written and well acted.  Other then Penn Badgely (sp?), you can actually believe these kids are in high school.  Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are really good as Olive's parents.  Every kid should be so lucky to have parents like this.  Overall, this movie works, but it does seem to wrap it all up a little too quickly and neatly at the end.  It's worth your time.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Spartacus is a very good acting series. The Blue Ray has an amazing resolution and in some scenes in the Roman theater, you can see some bugs from the digital process. Anyway, effects are very good done. I really expect for the new season with the same level of quality in both, acting and effects.
B002ASVYPU|5.0|I am very peculiar in my music shopping and when I heard these three guys from Dublin I instantly tought U2 has a competion lol(in a matter of speaking of course).  The album it's fantastic. The first song \\"We cry\\" it's an anthem to all that struggle - the mother who wants the best for her child, the guy who tries to get a record deal, the people that live on minimum wage and try to make due - very nowadays don't you think?  \\"The Man Who can't be moved\\" it's a flawless song, has a killer chorus and a gorgeous melody.  I could review all songs but i would never finish, so I'm just going to say that If You See Kay, I'm Yours and Rusty Halo are my favourites to death ... rock, pop and ballad. Perfect.  The whole album it's fantastic and Danny has a voice that was missing in the music world (besides being gorgeous by my standards).  Live performances? I'm not even going there because there aren't many artists that can deliver like they can.Perfect and I can't wait to see them in Portugal (my home country) next year.  Althoug I have the european version of this album, I just had to have the special edition.    Please, also check out their new album \\"Science & faith\\" [[ASIN:B0049JPU8A Science & Faith (US Bonus Track Version)]]that will go out in the US on jan 18th. It's way better than the first- i got the european version and I'm waiting for this one. Just Hope the US really supports them because this is what real music is.They write, produce,and still put up killer shows. Ireland it's back on the map (and don't forget Guiness lol)
B002ZG99A4|1.0|I got this movie because I really enjoyed the last Stallone´s  movie: RAMBO 4.  I expected even more in this one. It is a shame. I paid $19.99 and this movie worth 3 cents S&H incluided. Many parts in the movie are out of focus and dialogues plenty of stupid humor or humor without ingenious. It is incredible how Mr Stallone becomes in garbage a sky plenty of stars.
0240816250|5.0|Disclaimer:  This book is intended for use by photographers who have a basic working knowledge of exposure and who have processed film and made optical prints.  It is beyond basic and seems to be intended for the advanced hobbyist on up to the professional who wants a fresh look at Black and White analog capture.  That being said. . .    Way Beyond Monochrome fills an important gap in technical information pertaining to many aspects of Black and White film photography.  Until now, your most current sources have been the books by Ansel Adams (The Camera, The Negative and The Print), Henry Horenstein's books (Black and White Photography: A Basic Manual and Beyond Basic Photography), Minor White's The New Zone System Manual and Phil Davis' Beyond The Zone System, to name but a few.  All of these are still very relevant to film photography and should be a part of your library as they are mine.  However, all are out of print with the exception of Adams' trilogy.  And that is only a reprinting of 25 year old information for the most part.    The publication of this book has been a topic of excitement at APUG.ORG (the Analog Photography Users Group).  This, the 2nd edition (the first published in early 2003) has been filled with extensive coverage of most aspects of Black and White photography.   A list of topics are as follows:    From Visualization to Print  Print Control  Presentation  Tone Production  Zone System  Intro to Sensitometry  Image Capture  Negative Control  On Assignment (Applications of Photographic Practices and Processes)  Gear  Tools, Tips and Tricks    These are very generic classifications of the topics covered because the 537 pages give more than enough detail to busy the photographer who wishes to improve their craft for a long, long time.    As a 4x5 Black and White photographer, I cannot express how invaluable I find this resource.  Ralph and Chris have given us such a great gift in Way Beyond Monochrome Ed2.  I hope that you will take advantage of it.  You will not regret it.    Christopher Walrath
B003YP7N9O|5.0|I received this 2CD, 1 DVD package for Christmas.  I've only had time to listen to the first half of the DVD, but let me tell you, IF you have a 5.1 surround system and you know how to select the proper audio stream, you WILL get a glorious surround concert right in your room!  I want to thank a thousand times Jethro Tull and the record company for producing a 5.1 recording from Jethro Tull. I know there are still quite a few people out there that really enjoy the surround sound experience.  So far, the quality of the recording is top notch, especially for the time period it was recorded in.  Can't wait to hear the rest.

B000002AH9|5.0|I confess that I was not born a Billie Holiday fan.  I knew about her for as long as I can remember because my father, who spent several years as a professional jazz musician, always said that Billie Holiday was his favorite female jazz singer.  In my younger days, I didn't really see what the attraction was--she didn't have the range that many other jazz vocalists had and, in her later recordings such as this, the ravages of hard living clearly had damaged her voice.  Then I emotionally grew up--and I understood what a great singer she was.<br /><br />Though it brought attention to her tragic life to a new generation, the 1970's movie biography, \\"Lady Sings the Blues,\\" also gave us Diana Ross's \\"commericialized\\" version of Holiday's music, leaving some listeners more enamored with the \\"story\\" performance by Ross than with Holiday's actual singing.  Sadly, that is the shallow depth that many people's knowledge of Billie Holiday has been able to reach, and even that has faded with the passing years.<br /><br />Well, I've come to agree with my late father's assessment of Billie Holiday, \\"Probably the greatest jazz singer ever--maybe one of the best singers, period.\\"  As my review title suggests, I don't think most people can appreciate Billie Holiday until they have been through the emotional wringer--maybe a few times or more.  Have a relationship you thought would last forever come crashing down around your ears, or lose people closest to you, or face your own life-changing crises--well, then you may \\"get it\\" when you listen to Billie Holiday.  And, as others have noted, all of that pain and pathos just comes pouring out in this, what can only be called her \\"swan song\\" album.<br /><br />Listen to this album, and most everything you will hear from then on may just seem emotionally shallow and superficial--especially nearly all of today's \\"pop slop.\\"  This album is for people who are musically and emotionally grown-up.  Nearly every tune on this album is a jazz standard, covered by dozens upon dozens of singers over the years.  But, Billie Holiday, with frail voice and raw emotions, manages to \\"own\\" nearly every one of these tunes, such that you will likely think her version to be the definitive one from the moment you first hear her sing it on this album.  As to some peoples' criticism of the lush string arrangements--well, first, it was not uncommon in the era--part, I think, of the evolution and maturation of jazz.  And what orchestrations they are!  Ray Ellis's arrangements and conducting can not be faulted on this album.  At once both a juxtaposition and cocoon for Holiday's fragile voice, the orchestrations both allow Holiday's vocals to shine and yet wrap it in musical \\"satin\\" as the album title suggests.<br /><br />Would this album be as good if Holiday's voice  had been the marvel it was in her younger years?  Would this album hold the listener in an emotional vice had it not been recorded at the end of Holiday's sad and tortured life?  Acadamic questions, really.  Just know that that album is a masterpiece--probably one of those \\"essential masterpieces,\\" not only of jazz, but among all musical genres.  I believe it was Louis Armstrong that said about jazz, \\"If you have to ask what it is, you'll never know.\\"  Well, if this album doesn't twist your heart in an emotional knot when you really sit down and listen to it--that is, listen to the music and to what's in your heart--then no music will ever touch your soul the way that it should.s upon dozens of singers over the years.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Love this movie.. and watching it on Blu-Ray is awesome!<br />I was less than impressed with the limited bonus features included in this blu-ray pack.  There are two short pieces on the technology of Batman and the Psychology of Batman, that were somewhat interesting.  I would like to see more behind the scenes look into the creation of the film.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|If you like this movie, you have to own this DVD.  It's so well done, that it's like you're watching the movie in the location it's being shot.  The sound is crisp.  The high-def is as good as it gets.  I suppose the next thing they can come out with is a 3-D version of the film.  But nothing tops this version.  It's a class-act unto itself.  A small, but new piece added at the beginning with a piano is as lovely as the original songs.  I watched that piece alone a few times.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|For a band hailed as the next big thing out of the U.K. since Oasis, it is still surprising that more people haven't heard of the Arctic Monkeys.<br /><br />With its third album, \\"Humbug,\\" released on Aug. 25, the lads from across the pond are steadily entering into American consciousness, though longtime fans may be disappointed.<br /><br />Those of you still wondering \\"Who The @*%! Are The Arctic Monkeys?\\" look up its first two albums.<br /><br />The debut album \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not,\\" and breakthrough single \\"I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor\\" came out in 2006. Through constant touring and Internet fan pages, it became the fastest-selling debut album in British music history.<br /><br />Sounding like the recording came straight out of the garage, the raw energy and unpolished nature of the band appeals to any fan of the do-it-yourself attitude. Each song in \\"Whatever People Say,\\" composed of what seems to be several tunes hacked together, evolves beautifully with its own beginning, middle and end. Singer Alex Turner is an observant and sometimes bitter wallflower - commenting on situations with a strong Yorkshire accent that adds a charming flair to his otherwise brooding nature.<br /><br />The Monkeys' sophomore album, the significantly heavier \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare,\\" perfected its unique formula to make a CD that sounds fantastic from start to finish. The album is much more polished than its predecessor, but still maintains that sound of controlled chaos with songs like \\"Brianstorm\\" and \\"Teddy Picker.\\"<br /><br />As a third album, \\"Humbug\\" in its entirety may seem to be a bit of a disappointment, though it only appears so when compared to the Monkeys' previous works.<br /><br />Produced by Queens Of The Stone Age frontman, Josh Homme, the Monkeys introduce a new dreamy background ambience of sound that was only hinted at with Turner's side project, The Last Shadow Puppets.<br /><br />Also, fans of producer Dangermouse will appreciate the introduction, but it might alienate those waiting for another dance number.<br /><br />The first single, \\"Crying Lightning\\" weaves dreamy guitars and clever wordplay into a grand showcase of what the band does best. Pulling together Turner's storytelling genius and the band's penchant for a living, breathing musical backdrop, \\"Lightning\\" is the best song on the album.<br /><br />Halfway through the album, long-time Monkeys fans expecting something more dynamic and danceable will find it in \\"Potion Approaching\\" and then \\"Pretty Visitors\\" with more familiar, funky rhythms.<br /><br />Most of the songs are missing that defining vitality that allowed each song to unfold into several different rhythms and melodies.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a sign of the band's maturity, to make a song as consistent as some of these are, but I miss the almost haphazard combinations of song elements. Of the ten songs on the CD, only a handful follow the usual configuration.<br /><br />It is unfair to say this is a step back for The Arctic Monkeys. Instead think of \\"Humbug\\" as a slight sidestep exploring only a certain vision of the band.<br /><br />Fans can appreciate that the Dylan-esque social commentary-through-storytelling is still there, further defined in soulful ballads like \\"Cornerstone.\\"<br /><br />While \\"Humbug\\" would indeed complete the collection, fans of the first two albums are better off looking up the multitude of unheard B-sides, which are all masterpieces in their own rights.<br /><br />[Published in the BU Scout on September 9, 2009]another dance number.

B001C46P2K|5.0|I waited months for this to come out and was not disappointed! The writing, acting, costumes, cinematography, musical score- everything about this movie is of the highest quality and it all comes together beautifully, making a story worth telling come to life! I have watched this a dozen times and loaned it out, and everyone I know agrees with me. I do wish it had been longer. It gets you fully immersed in the storyline and then suddenly ends, making you want to cry, \\"Not yet!\\" This will take your breath away!
B003OF3R0S|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and this band. Avenged Sevenfold was the band that introduced me to rock (this coming from someone who was obsessed with Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears in Middle school and High school, so that says ALOT.) Ever since then, I mainly listen to Rock. Mostly A7X. Their music is amazing. Some people call it emo but it makes me feel great so I don't know exactly why they call it that. Maybe they close their minds to it, not sure. Anyway, like I said, I LOVE this CD. It was great! I hope they keep writing music.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|This movie has much more potential than what we saw in this movie. I honestly liked it. But I expected a lot more from it. The story line and dialogs were either undone or felt like it lacked something, like a sauce for a spaghetti. Now let's take a look at the positives. Stallone chose a good(but not great) team of actors. There's plenty of money were put in the making of film and loads of nice ammo, shooting. But still it felt different as I mentioned above. From the team of veterans(well-known action actors) I still expected better roles as for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. I expected the whole movie to be great. But as much as I wanted to love it from the first minute I can't say I did. And it was hard for me to decide to either give it three or four stars. I decided four for all the efforts. I wish the next people who will make a movie like expendables will do it a lot, a lot better. They will definitely know this movie, know what people want, what was good and what was missing. And make another, one hell of an amazing action movie!

B003U0AHBO|4.0|Being unprepared as I was for this version of the fabled archer turned out to be an advantage of sorts. It could have had another name unrelated to previous versions and I wouldn't have had to shift my expectations for the storyline as it unfolded. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and will view it many times to glean the details.

I finished the book in one day.  I simply could not put it down.  The character development, the story, Ms. de Rosnay's writing style--all were first rate and totally engrossing.  I highly recommend this book not only for a history lesson into one of our darkest periods, but also for beautifully written prose and intricately drawn characters.

0060936223|5.0|Sometimes when you read a memoir (e.g., \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\"), you leave impressed by the author's struggle to tell the story as honestly as possible.  In the case of \\"Just Kids,\\" it's not about being literally honest;  it's about conveying the innocence, sweetness and intensity of a first love and the perseverance necessary to become an artist.  Through artful prose, Patti Smith shares with us her years with her first real love, Robert Mapplethorpe, at a time when America was undergoing a major shift in cultural values.  These two young people worked so hard at their art and supported each other's artistic pursuits so wholeheartedly -- even after their sexual relationship had ceased -- that they both rose to the top of their respective art worlds.  I recommend this book for young artists.  For those interested in learning more about Mapplethorpe, I would recommend Patricia Morrisroe's excellent book:  \\"Mapplethorpe: A biography.\\"      One caveat:  I originally purchased this book on Kindle and was disappointed that it did not include the photos included in the hard copy. I would definitely recommend the hard copy on this book.
030746363X|4.0|It's no secret that the best of the Slow Carb diet information located within The 4-Hour Body is actually located on Tim's blog for free.  So, if you are just interested in the diet plan, I would highly recommend that you take a look at it there.  Just search for \\"lose 20 lbs of fat in 30 days\\" on Google, and it should be listed at the top.  Since part of the 4 Hour Workweek lifestyle is to actually cut down on information overload, the blog is really all you need.  But to get the information in a format that doesn't require a Google search every time, then I do recommend the purchase.  Compared to other diet plans, the cost of the book is extremely cheap, even if you do get a lot of information that you might not need.<br /><br />With that being said, I actually used the information from the blog to lose 47 pounds on this plan starting at the end of December 2009 up until the end of April 2010, so I know that it will work!  I lost 20 pounds my first month, 15 the next, and then the rest over the next 6 weeks.  I also suffered some pretty severe hypoglycemia episodes before the diet, but they have all but disappeared now (well except for when I splurged on desserts at Christmas).  Because of the help I received from the blog, I gladly plunked down the money to purchase The 4-Hour Body because I feel that the positive change in my health is easily worth the $15 I spent on the book.<br /><br />That being said, I do wish the orgasm sections weren't in this book.  Those parts kept me from purchasing several more copies to give away as presents.  I'm not a prude by any means, but I feel like some people (i.e. female employees, Mom, Dad) would take it the wrong way if I gave them a book with those sections.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this book.  It can change your life if you follow the diet plans (it certainly changed mine).  It might change your life if you follow the muscle building tactics.  Tim says that everything in the book are experiments conducted on himself and others, but doesn't guarantee the same results for the reader.  If you are stuck or limited in your own weight loss or exercise routines, give the book a shot, and see if it helps you out!doesn't guarantee the same results for the reader.

0312370849|3.0|While the story goes back and forth in time, the book is engaging and interesting, and I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  But after about 2/3 of the way through, the book goes flat and is disappointing.  I felt let down afterwards and couldn't figure out why.  It is a good read and the story telling is well done, but the main character loses something once she puts all the pieces together.

B0042RUMJG|5.0|This is definetely one of the best or maybe the best bluray concert I own.  All aspects: video, audio, edition are excellent.  The berlin orchestra is outstanding and Sting´s vocal performance is awesome.  Every Police or Sting fan should own this product.  Since Sting´s music has a very strong classical influence, the blended arrangements fitted as if the music had been created for it.  Only one complaint and is regards to the track list, were I missed to see the greats from \\"Ten Summoner´s Tales\\" (Fields..., If I ever lose... and Nothin´about me).  They were part of the concert, because I saw some domestic footage in YouTube, however wasn´t included in the Bluray listing.  In my opinion, the best tracks are: Desert Rose, King of Pain, When we dance, Mad About you, and every little thing.......
B003VR5PPY|4.0|To put it simply, this game is wonderful. There are minor points of frustration to be sure, but overall, 999 delivers.    First of all, the writing and story are spectacular. And the character development is nearly unparalleled in today's games. 999 serves up a deep, gritty, and rich narrative that absorbs you into another world.     The gameplay element, comprised of various puzzles, while not the strong suit of the title, are fairly engaging as well. They are usually a welcome pace breaker. However, they can be tedious at times, especially when completing them for the third or fourth time.    This brings up my final point. The game has 6 (not 9) endings, so multiple playthroughs are required to see them all. After the first playthrough the game grants a \\"fast-forward\\" feature to blow past things already read, but it does not allow you to skip puzzles. This is a little annoying, but again, it is a minor complaint.    All in all, 999 is a gem that deserves to be played. And its \\"true\\" ending is definitely worth the multiple playthroughs necessary to reach it. So get it now before it's really hard to find!

B002T9H2MO|4.0|Director Duncan Jones pays homage to previous science fiction classics such as 2001, Silent Running, Outland and Alien, and does so from the same type of \\"grown up\\" science fiction perspective. His first film, Moon, does just that, offering a psychological edginess to one man's experience out in space. In the film, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is completing a three year contract for Lunar Industries, where he lives on the moon and collects samples of helium3, a source of energy. He has virtually no contact with humans other than via video messages from his wife; GERTY (Kevin Spacey), a robot, is his only companion during this time. Sam feels a sense of cabin fever and claustrophobia as the time winds down, and begins having strange hallucinations as his time is almost up. While exploring out on the moon, he has an accident. The aftermath of the accident is where the film gets tricky. He wakes up in the infirmary talking with GERTY, but sees what appears to be another version of himself in the room. Realizing that he is not hallucinating this time, Sam begins to uncover secrets about Lunar Industries and events back home.      Some may take Moon to be standard sci-fi fare, but I think Moon has its own approach to understanding the effects of isolation on an individual, and what it means to be human, and develops its own answers for these issues. Sam's searching for answers out in space involve being exposed to emotionally-draining truths and revelations. Moon is an intelligent, thought-provoking movie that you can step back after watching and reflect upon. At points, the film investigates the claustrophobic feeling of not only being \\"closed in\\" and isolated from society, but from doubting one's own identity or where one is at in the universe, spiritually, psychologically, or physically. An unsettling perspective is realized throughout Sam's point of view, and Sam Rockwell does a superb job of capturing a wide range of emotions: anger, frustration, despair, paranoia, sadness, hope. The ending might not be awe-dropping, but Moon is a solid, smart sci-fi that makes you think about the essence of technology and its place, and what measures we should or shouldn't take in gaining knowledge.     The extras from the DVD are exceptional. There is a commentary with Duncan Jones as well as The Making of Moon, which sheds some light on the basis for the story as well as the effects. I particularly enjoyed the Q and A session with Duncan Jones at the screening in Houston. Hearing the direction for the film, and the inspiration for it, gives you a better perspective for what the film was trying to achieve.     Over all, Moon is a great addition to the sci-fi film genre.
B0002BO05S|3.0|\\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" is another biblical epic about the life of Jesus. It follows his story from his birth to his crucifiction and resurrection. The film is very beautifully staged and filmed. The pace is slow with much focus on Jesus's philosphy. Max von Sydow plays a larger-than-life Jesus, who speaks in King James Bible quotes. He's never developed into a deeper, multidemensional character, which makes it somewhat difficult for the viewer, or at least for me, to really get involved in the story. A Christian viewer may find it easier to relate to the character and story; the film definitely takes Jesus's teachings and the gospels very seriously. The acting is good. Some have criticised the film for the many celebrity cameos. They didn't bother me, and I must admit I didn't even notice Angela Lansbury or Shelley Winters in the film so their cameos must have been very small. Von Sydow is good in the lead but because his character is underdeveloped there are others that are more interesting. I especially enjoyed Charlton Heston (as John the Baptist), David McCallum (as Judas) and Telly Savalas (as Pontius Pilate (this was apparently the film he first shaved his head for)).    To sum up, \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" is a gorgeous, technically very well made film that's weaker on characterization and narrative, but still definitely worth watching for fans of biblical and/or epic films.
006123141X|1.0|Somewhere, there's a lonely guy who continues to send hate mail to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their vicious Best Picture snubbings of _National Treasure_ and _G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra_.<br /><br />James Rollins wrote _The Doomsday Key_ just for that guy. That's my theory, and I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />Nothing else could explain the level of vapidity on display in this novel. The plastic, stereotypical characters. The artless prose. Dialog unworthy of an elementary school Christmas play. And humor even Tom Green would not have allowed to taint _Freddy Got Fingered_. Is it possible that this is the novelization for the sequel to _Team America: World Police_?<br /><br />So why do I keep reverting to movie references when this is a novel? Because I'm struggling to think of a novel I've read in the last 20 years that could possibly be this bad.<br /><br />Seriously, I think I lost IQ points reading _The Doomsday Key_.<br /><br />Was it the horde of rampaging polar bears? The elaborate booby traps engineered by ancient Christian monks (\\"Impale thy neighbor?\\")? The love-starved female assassins? Or was the mind-numbing seriousness of it all what ultimately dooms this book?<br /><br />If anyone even cares to ponder those questions, get professional help.<br /><br />No matter what you do, avoid this book like the plague. I don't hand out a lot of one-star reviews, but if I could petition Amazon for the addition of zero stars, I would make a special effort for this novel.<br /><br />If Sigma Force were real, I'd suggest the biggest apocalyptic threat they need to neutralize is James Rollins's publishing contract. Maybe then we would all sleep more peacefully.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Got this DVD to try out the new 3D TV and Blu Ray player, well it worked perfectly.  Watching it in 3D was way better than watching it in 2D.  Although $30 is a lot to watch a movie once, it was great.

B002ZG99QS|4.0|I have always been a big fan of the original Tron, having seen it multiple times at the local theater house back in 1982, so I was psyched to see this sequel (which, I believe, is the longest time in the history of movies between an original film and it's sequel - 28 years). I did have some trepidation since many of the super-hyped films of the last decade have been consummate flops or, at the very most, \\"so-so\\" films.       I am happy to say that \\"Tron: Legacy\\" does not fall into that category. The film delivers a logical sequel to its predecessor and, like it's parent film, has broken new ground in the realm of special effects. IMHO, it even gives \\"Avatar\\" a run for it's money in that category.       So, let's start with that. Like the original \\"Tron\\", \\"Legacy\\" is incredible eye candy. I was able to see this in IMAX 3D and that is defintely the way to go. Some complain of headaches and other issues when dealing with 3D, but I found it to be a pleasurable experience (unlike other 3D films I have seen) and even a vital or necessary way to view \\"Tron: Legacy\\" in order to get the full effect of its rich, detailed and mind-blowing special effects. The combination of live-action and computer animation is seamless and masterfully done. The use of light and shadow was also very evident throughout the film and it definitely gives you the feeling of being immersed in \\"the grid\\". The combat sequences were very well done, but we get a little too much of the \\"Matrix\\" slow-mo dodging of bullets (or discs in this case). That kind of thing was the way to go back in 1999, but it seems so cliche now. Other than that, a very exciting experience. Also, the CGI rendering of Kevin Flynn to make him look 30-ish again was pretty damn convincing.        Next seems to be the biggest problem that most of the critics had with \\"Legacy\\" and that is the plot. Personallly, I found the plot to be well-conceived, logical and engaging. The relationship between Sam and Kevin Flynn was well-played and gave the film biblical undertones. At one point in the film, a minor character cries out \\"Behold! The son of our maker!\\". I won't give away any more details than that, but you can catch the parralels between Christ and Sam Flynn with that one phrase. There are other parallels as well. Regardless, the story makes sense, continues the plot elements of the original film and is easy to follow. The film does slow up a bit and gets bogged down with the \\"we have to fill you in on what happened in the past 28 years\\" sequences, but then it picks right back up. There are some memorable characters (I loved the night club owner) and really good one-liners, but sadly, the film's namesake \\"Tron\\" is only a minor character and we barely get to see him.       To sum up, \\"Tron: Legacy\\" delivers. The special effects are absolutely amazing, the story is engaging and the characters are memorable. This is definitely a film that you will want to see again and that, folks, is why we go to the movies.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was the first book I bought on my Kindle and it was well worth  the money spent. Emma Donoghue creates an inspiring story of a young boy and his mother who have been held captive by a disturbing character named &#34;Old Nick&#34;. After years of confinment, they hatch a mastermind plan to make a &#34;Great Escape&#34;. This novel is a truly amazing piece of work as Donoghue brings to life a story of captivity, freedom, and meeting the world for the first time through the mind of a five year old boy. Personally, after reading this I have a renewed appreciation for freedom and the world I am so blessed to live in.
B0049VQZUA|1.0|There are just too many key elements of the plot revealed here and it's always a shame when trailers wreck the really great films they are intending to promote. I was just lucky to have watched Episode 1 before watching the free 5-minute preview. And Episode 1 is spectacular... a 5-star show, excellent special effects and great acting. I am hooked and can't wait to watch all of the rest in Season 1. This is the best zombie flick ever and some very fine sci-fi in general. It just leaped way ahead of Zombieland which was my previous front-runner. The story is much more true-to-life and riveting. BUT... DON\\"T WATCH THE FREE 5-MINUTE PREVIEW FIRST.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|Watching the beginning of Tron Legacy requires bracketing out two prospective ironies. First, did Disney, the litigiousest place on earth, recognize itself as Encom, the high tech firm shown introducing its heavily rights-managed software to the world? And second, in a nod to the film's theme, is the horrifying CGI young Jeff Bridges a comment on the inability of computing systems to render \\"imperfect\\" humans?     Tron Legacy seems to be assembled out of separate component parts that don't quite fit. On the one hand, there is the story that tries to be a meditation on father/son relationships, and the nature of digital systems. Then there is the direction, in which Joseph Kosinski's greatest concern seems to have been making sure that underwear lines aren't visible. Then there are the actors who seem to be fending for themselves, never sure what's happening around them and why. The effect is like watching a music video in which distant, hazy memories of Willy Wonka, Star Wars and the original Tron are remixed with a special issue of Dwell.    Kosinsky knows how to make a sexy Elite model of a film that yearns to be ogled. Yet, the requirements of narrative film are such that there needs to be emotional and thematic engagement. So the father/son relationship and the \\"what is perfection?\\" theme are grafted on via endless exposition. The end result is more like watching an experiment in implantation than drama, perhaps fitting for a film about technology.

0920236162|5.0|I first found this book years ago - when my now 12 year old daughter was about 4 I bought it for her birthday. I keep purchasing this book over and over - for every little girl I know. I was never into the fairy tales that the girl got saved by the guy - I always liked ones where she either saved herself/overcame obstacles or it was a collaboration, so I loved this book from the first time I read it - and both my daughters love it too. My 9 year old still asks me to read it to her often, and we have fun with it. I also tell every parent/educator etc I meet about it - lol and I know quite a few of them - and know many have purchased it for girls in their lives and love it as much as I do.    Thank you Mr. Munsch for writing this fabulous story which shows that   A) girls/women can not only take care of themselves, but are also often the first to help others  B) that females are smart, strong and creative  C) for encouraging the above with a fun and funny story  D) that no one should put up with anyone who acts as \\"prince Ronald\\" did - and you can live without them    I will keep buying this book as long as I live.....for every girl I can!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book, like other books written by Rick Riodan, is an amazing read.  The characters are easy to relate to and, although I prefer Percy over Jason, have very distinct personalities that make their points of view interesting for the reader.  The plot is fast paced and exciting, filled with many unpredictable twists.  This book enhances the world introduced in the Percy Jackson Series and I would definately recommend it to people of all ages.

B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|This is a review of the 2009 release of \\"Time out\\" which has an extra cd of live material and a dvd. Haven't checked out the dvd, but the live recording is a nice bonus.       \\"Take five\\" is a track I've know of for a few years now, so I thought I'd give the album it came off of a listen. Haven only heard a few jazz albums, but this is the first one which scores full marks from me. I'd describe the album as easy listening and perhaps demonstrating some classical music influence. Since I've recently been listening to jazz on the radio (to get away from songs/acts I'm not into on stations with a \\"classic hits\\" format), I've found myself liking the drums, bass and piano or brass instrument set-up. What makes \\"Time out\\" so well suited to the tag \\"easy listening\\" is the mellow sound of Paul Desmond's alto saxophone. Other jazz bands have a brass instrument which really demand your attention and are quite sharp to the hearing. Not hear. Apart from the double bass player, all the musicians add nice touches to the music...Joe Morello on drums, Paul Desmond on alto saxophone and Dave Brubeck on the piano. Eugene Wright's double bass playing doesn't strike me as interesting but he doesn't detract from the sound of the album, which is good.        Studio album length - 38:36 minutes long. Live album length - 54:19. Not sure how long the DVD runs.      The classic (\\"/\\"):      Take five - 5:27 minutes long. Iconic elements to this track include the simple and catchy cymbal riff intro, simple and catchy piano riff and the alto saxophone melody. Morello's drum solo in this track is extended and restrained. Good and interesting solo in any case. His live version is a treat too...he really rocks out on the drums on the second, live cd.       Next best (on second listen - \\">[.]\\"):      Blue Rondo à la Turk - 6:46. Has a sort of familiar piano melody...not sure if I know it from elsewhere...I'm not aware of knowing any other Brubeck compositions apart from \\"Take five\\". In any case,the piano plays a catchy motif. One piano melody has a sort of children's chant vibe to it. This is one of those tracks with a classical music vibe to it (in my uninformed opinion). The alto saxophone melody is also nice. A poppy track, which then gets mellow and then has grandiose elements to it...as if for an Ali Baba movie or something of the sort.      The rest:      Strange meadow lark - 7:24. A mellow piece with long piano solos, in a classical style, I think, bookending the track. Brush type percussion and cymbals feature as well.     Three to get ready - 5:27. Has a nice piano melody...a bit classical in style. Brush percussion and regular drum percussion. Another children's song kind of melody played on the piano. This is nice enough, but I prefer it when Brubeck works up a sort of funky rhythm on his piano...it sounds sort of like the piano is doing the equivalent of vocal scatting.    Kathy's waltz - 4:51. A mellow track. Brush style percussion features again. Brubeck's piano has a different tone in this track...sort of tinnier sounding, if that makes sense. A couple of melodies/licks in this song sound familiar...e.g. there's a bit which reminds me of the later Beatles' song \\"All my loving\\" (perhaps for the line which goes \\"Tomorrow I'll miss you\\") as well as a lick which reminds me of the song \\"Hello Dolly\\"...another song which postdates this album.     Everybody's jumpin' - 4:24. A mellow track. Brush percussion and cymbals feature again. The drum tone has an interesting texture and you get a mini drum solo. The piano sometimes plays a couple of notes which brings \\"Take five\\" to mind. Track has some modernish pop melodies to it.    Pick up sticks - 4:16. Cymbals on this perhaps have a \\"Take five\\" vibe to them as well.       Second CD: Live at Newport - 1961, 1963 and 1964.      Excellent sound quality on this cd. An announcer introduces the band. Brubeck introduces one song too. You can hear the crowd a little bit on this album and a lot towards the end of this cd. Maybe jazz 'purists' will appreciate this live album more than \\"Time out\\"...it's less poppier in my view. I'd probably give this cd 7/10.      The best tracks:      Take five - 7:18. Maybe more variety in the drum tones in this version. Perhaps the piano plays a different melody in the interlude. The introductory notes on the piano perhaps recall a Nina Simone song...pretty vague, I know. Morello's drumming is hard hitting on this version, in contrast to his restrained performance on the studio album version. However, I like the subtlety to his drumming on this track as well...his rhythm (and I'm not talking about the stuff he does on the cymbals here). This is the final track on the album and the crowd is rapturous at the end of it.    Koto song - 6:00. \\">[.]\\". The weird symbol on the left denotes that on second listen I found the track slightly noteworthy. A pleasant, mellow track. Interesting piano melody at the start. Piano and double bass playing delicate at times. In fact, the piano is quite faint. Brush percussion and cymbals used.      The rest:      St.Louis blues - 7:55. Laid back jazz track, thanks to the alto saxophone. Piano is jaunty though. Drums are off kilter and you get an extended drum solo later, with some solid hitting by Morello. Definitely a track to consider for the tail end of my list on songs with great drum parts to them.     Waltz limp - 4:57. Pretty much a piano and cymbal dominant piece with the latter providing an insistent rhythm. Later you get more alto saxophone and bass.    Since love had its way - 6:19. Busy cymbals dominate in this track then lots of  alto saxophone.    Pennies from Heaven - A jaunty track. Some brassy instrumentation...sounds sharper, so I'm not sure if the alto saxophone is still being used. Later the piano plays a recognisable tune...not sure if it's the same one found in \\"Kathy's waltz\\"...maybe a bit of a \\"Hello Dolly\\" kind of vibe to that part too...or was it \\"All my loving\\"?    You go to my head - 9:36. Track book ended by the alto sax. For most of the track though it's a mellow piano piece...which is nice at times. Simple bass and cymbals  with the piano doing most of the melody of the track.    Blue Rondo à la Turk - 7:22.  By the time I listened to this track the piano lick had become familiar. From 4:44 I heard some familiar piano notes, but I couldn't quite place them. Interesting drumming patterns and I think that a bassy drum is used at times, too. Think that my notes say that the last 25 seconds of the track have a grandiose sounding piano...as in the studio version of the track (presumably).      Recommendations:      Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers - Moanin'. 75/100. Instrumental jazz album. Good track on it for drum lovers (\\"The drum thunder suite\\"). Has a variety of sounds and moods to it. Interesting drumming too.    John Coltrane - Blue train. 72.5/100. Instrumental jazz album. Jaunty, with busy and sharp sounding brass. To this novice the album sounds modern later.

So I put it on my Christmas list, and Santa was listening (well, now he's deaf, I guess!).    The new fellow is kinda like Arnel Pineda: he echoes the original singer well enough to make things work comfortably, but has enough of his own sound to avoid a copycat designation.    I'll give it 5 stars-it's not like the greatest metal album of all time, but ya gotta give it to these guys for coming back after a long time, with a different singer from the iconic Udo Dirkschneider, and cranking out some face-melting tunes. Up to the standard of \\"Restless and Wild\\"/\\"Balls to the Wall\\"? (Or for that matter \\"I'm a Rebel\\"/\\"Breaker\\"?). Mmmm, maybe not quite, though I'm just on the first listen. But certainly worthy of mention in the same breath.    Finally, how can you resist a record released on the \\"Nuclear Blast\\" label?!?
B00005RIKI|5.0|I love this album every song is great and very well done also they had one of the best producers ever al kooper he produced a masterpiece this album should be in everybodys collection i know free bird is one of the most played songs ever in radio history but i dont care that song is beautiful gary rossingtons slide guitar is a very beautiful masterpiece and the guitar solo on free bird is one of the best   i have ever heard i suggest everybody to have this album second helping,nuthin fancy,gimmie back my bullets,and street survivors they are all a must have thats how talented this band is
0307271862|1.0|Q: Do I blame the author or the translator? A: the author    This is one of the most puerile pedagogic rants you will ever read. Let's start with the plot. You can guess who of the \\"dun it\\" by page 70 of the 359 page book. Clue? He does one of those Conan Doyle alkali plane tricks. Then there's the circa 1970s NUS bromides throughout the book. The evils doers are all capitalists, with a special place reserved for Americans. Then there's colonialists. The author can't seem to maintain his calm as he describes Ian Smith's Rhodesia as brutal, racist and fascist on three successive pages. Mugabe is \\"misunderstood and fair\\" and, best of all, the Cultural Revolution a \\"whoops but well intentioned mistake\\" that modern China should yearn to return to.     It's palpable nonsense from beginning to end and swarms with that upper class superiority that only the Swedes can engineer. Don't bother. My copy hit the trash the day after Christmas...and I paid for it.
B00005R8FI|5.0|Well i bought this cd thinking that mick taylor was on this album so i bought this piece of music blindfolded i was pretty bummed when i opened the cd to find that he wasnt on this album so i put the cd in the player heard the first song and i instantly loved it this album and everysong is awesome i am very grateful to hear this album the musicianship and the workmanship on this album is subperb i love it the classical guitar playing by jon mark is great and the flute and the harmonica and alto saxophones are beautiful and they play great live
B003O86FMW|4.0|With the first book in the trilogy, The Hunger Games, you expected some ramp up time into District 12 (Katniss's home), her life and the world she lives in so it was to be expected that there might be some time to acclimate. You wouldn't think that would be necessary in a second book, but it seems to take a lot longer for much of consequence to happen in this one, or at least that's the way it felt for me. This book starts shortly after the events of the first book and the aftermath of not only Katniss winning the Hunger Games, but how she managed to keep Peeta alive as well by threatening to kill herself and the fallout that has caused. Granted, there is an intense scene somewhat early in the book with President Snow visiting her and her family that sets up the main conflict for this and the next book, but beyond that, it seems like much of the first half of the book struggles to stay focused and seemed really just a prelude to the real story that was about to begin.<br /><br />That being said, once it's clear that Katniss has become the catalyst for revolution, the story really picks up and gets interesting again. We are introduced to some very memorable characters in the second half of this book and the action once things get moving is faster paced than in the first book which helps you really relate well to what Katniss must be experiencing when trying to make sense of people's actions in the Quarter Quell(a special Hunger Games held every 25 years). In fact, by the time you get to the end of this second chapter in the trilogy, your sort of left wondering \\"what just happened\\" which was I'm sure the author's intention as it ends on a cliffhanger.<br /><br />While I don't think this book overall is quite as strong as The Hunger Games and probably does suffer a bit from being the middle of a 3 part story, it is still a very good effort and ends very, very well, albeit on a cliffhanger that is resolved in the third and final chapter. As with the first book, it's written for young adults and is probably best read by kids 12 and older.tten for young adults and is probably best read by kids 12 and older.
B000063DFQ|5.0|What great album this is great heavy metal adrian smith and dave murray are great musicians and subperb guitar players and lets not forget steve harris one of the best heavy metal bass players of all time anyways piece of mind is one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time and every song is great pick it up you will play it forever guaranteed also check out powerslave its just as good
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I started out reading this because my 12 year old daughter told me that they had read this book in school and I wanted to see what she was being exposed to. I had heard some things about this book being violent and I knew that it was being made into a movie so it was a relatively popular book and I had so I decided to see for myself what the book was about.<br /><br />Turns out that the story itself is somewhat violent in the sense that many teenagers are sent to the \\"arena\\" and most die, though many end up dying \\"off screen\\". The some deaths that are described are fairly tame and don't get graphic or too descriptive, though one death is fairly emotional when it happens which might be challenging for some younger, more sensitive readers. I wouldn't recommend the book to much younger than a 12 year old, unless your child is pretty mature and isn't going to be overly sensitive to characters they may have grown attached to dying.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I ended up getting hooked and reading through the whole thing in a couple days. I found it to be a fun, enjoyable read with characters that were pretty believable. This book is intended for young adults much in the same way that the first two Harry Potter books were. I was able to the books for what they were and accepted them for what they set out to be.<br /><br />While I did enjoy the book, I also thought there were some missed opportunities as well. I thought the book ended a bit clumsily and left some golden opportunities unexplored, I thought many of the characters were not very well fleshed out and came across as 1 dimensional including Katniss's family.<br /><br />All in all I'd recommend it to just about anyone as an easy but interesting read that sets up the next two books in the trilogy nicely.
B001EN71CW|4.0|So this is where me and the girlfriend are coming from. We are not big Sci-Fi people but people kept on saying you have to check out Battlestar Galactica. So I was able to convince the GF to watch (she is  not a fan of Sci-Fi) and we watched five hours the first night.  So we loved BSG (though thought the ending for BSG was lacking - but that is another discussion ) We were recommending BSG to our friends, and they said they had already watched it, and if we liked BSG that we might like Firefly.  So we instantly picked it up.     Well, it took a few episodes of firefly to get used to the mix of western and space genres. But it was very entertaining and brought some real new orginal stuff to the screen. (though, I kept getting reminded of the star wars character, Hans-solo with the mix of space and western outlaw) Its an interesting ensemble cast and some good storylines.    So if you are a fan of BSG and haven't gotten to firefly I would recommend it. It really is a pity it was only on for one season because I think the stories and acting would have only gotten better with more chemistry and actors and writers getting a feel for the roles.    all that said, its still a mix of space and western which could be a turnoff to people.  It reminds me of fusion food, where they combine two different genres of food. theres a sushi fusion place that serves hispanic inspired sushi rolls.  its that type of combination , that you will either love or it might turn you off, but definetly worth trying.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|I loved the first Iron Man, like most people, and thought along side of The Dark Knight was one of the finest superhero movies to come along in a long time. This second movie adds the incredibly beautiful Scarlett Johansson, though she doesn't have a lot to do until the last part of the movie. While I certainly appreciate her addition, I did feel like the Avengers sub-plot stuff got in the way of the movie and ultimately detracted from the story. An example of real life concerns negatively influencing the art it creates. Mickey Rourke is largely wasted here and much of the movie sort of just drifted from scene to scene. For the most part, I agree with a lot of the reviewers here that said Robert Downey Jr. is the only reason this movie succeeds to even the degree it did and that the rest of the movie was not nearly on par with either it's predecessor or other superhero movies.<br /><br />I got the Blu-Ray combo pack so I did like that it was very easy to stick this on my IPod and the picture is beautiful, but unfortunately, the movie itself could have been a lot better. I'd cautiously recommend this movie to someone who's a huge Iron Man or Robert Downey Jr. fan provided the price is right, otherwise I'd say rent it, don't buy it.
0312370849|5.0|From the moment I picked up Sarah's Key, I was unable to put it down. I have not had that experience in quite some time. The book switches between past (Sarah) and present (Julia) every few pages. Each \\"chapter\\" provided just enough information to peak my interest to continue.    The book follows Sarah, a young Jewish girl, who is taken along with her family by the French police in July of 1942. Sarah had been sheltered from the increasingly hostile climate towards Jews and was left unaware as to what was happening around her. She was able to use her quick wits and intelligence to figure it out fairly quickly. Her journey begins the second she locks her four year old brother in a hidden cupboard, promising to return for him in a few days. She is determined to make it back to him before it is too late. I can't help but think that the key to the cupboard was also her key out of the concentration camp. If she had not yearned to save her brother, she would have been unable to save herself--something she never realizes.    Julia, a journalist, is writing a piece on the French roundup. Her story leads her to Sarah and she becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her. Their paths intertwine and it makes for a great read! I love Tatiana de Rosnay integrated historical events into this story, especially an event that is apparently, not only unheard of but also ignored by many.     I highly recommend this book!
B00415ZW58|3.0|I loved this movie.  I watched it with a friend first then I felt very touched and wanted a copy of my own so I did some research online and found that Amazon supposedly have the best version of this movie so I decided to invest in it.  I love the picture qualities, audios, and the subtitles were great but two of the four dvds' were defected.  Skips and freezes so I contacted the seller and got those two exchanged.  Now I'm happy.
0375842209|5.0|4.5 stars.<br /><br />Never read a book like this.<br /><br />The alternative writing style and formatting appealed to me. I love section breaks. It provides me with a breather, gives me a waypoint. And Zusak provides copious section breaks, sometimes for no apparent reason. And I loved it.<br /><br />The story, told from Death's POV, appealed to me, also. A nice voice. Mostly, though, Zusak writes Death's voice with explosive imagery. Not all the metaphors made sense, but they always created an impression, blooming with color, expression, and visions that were so vivid that I could feel the dank coldness of the basement, the misery of the Jew parade, the thrill of Ilsa Hermann's library, the drag of a cigarette. I was less concerned about where the story was going and settled in to enjoy the ride. The words transported me (and I read every single word, no skimming; rare for me). Of course, the power of words was the main thrust of the plot, so bravo, Zusak.<br /><br />The story was long. There were many scenes that were extraneous, especially 2/3 of the way through. I started to wane at that point. I suppose this is the only reason I rated it 4.5 stars instead of 5. But, like Zusak's unusual writing style, he tells the story in unusual fashion when Death gives away much of the ending along the way. I found this intriguing but noticed how it weakened the ending's impact. That shouldn't have come as a surprise. Even though I knew what was coming, I still expected to be moved more than I was. Still, it was difficult not to love almost all the characters by the end, including the curse-filled Mama. But especially Rudy.<br /><br />I'll go back to another Zusak book in the near future.
0399250395|5.0|We have a daugher that isn't quite 2 years old.  When I added this book to her wish list, I had NO IDEA how awesome it was.  My grandmother bought it for her as a Christmas gift and we have read it everyday for the last week...MULTIPLE times!  She adores it.  She can practically tell the story herself now and points to all of the things that pop up.  This is not like any pop up book I remember as a child.  I love how much she loves it!  We have to make sure she doesn't get a hold of it when we aren't around or she would probably destroy it.  But, with adult supervision for younger ones, I think it is the best gift idea ever!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Amazing book, I read it in one day. It was a heart wrenching, painful, but wonderful ride. Definitely one of the best books I've read in years.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|I had been looking for this Blu-ray to get as a gift for my boyfriend.  I had trouble locating it.  THe product was in perfect condition.  Very satisfied.
B00005JLKN|1.0|Hands down, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can't believe a cast of such amazing actors failed so miserably, but I guess it all depends on your director. Ed Norton acts like the father figure in an after-school movie - yeah, it's that campy and kitsch-ey. Anthony Hopkins, in trying to reproduce his role as Hannibal Lecter, goes over the top and looks about 20 years older than he did in Silence of the Lambs. Which I understand! But why recast him at all?!? Harvey Kietel... terrible! From The Piano and Pulp Fiction to this? I am such a huge Ralph Fiennes fan that I can't even speak of his performance here, it is far too dreadful. The ONLY good actor in this entire film was Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had a very small role.     I have never even seen Manhunter or the original film adaptation of Red Dragon. What I have done is watch enough good movies to know that this is NOT one. It drags on, it has to explain every inch of progress for the dim-witted viewers, not enough character development behind Francis Dolarhyde OR Will Graham... I could go on for ages. Just skip this movie and read the book, I implore you. Save yourself the 124 minutes and make soup or something. Boil 124 eggs. Sitting and staring at a wall is a better use of 2 hours. I can't even understand what the positive reviews are about, good lord.
B004259BMM|5.0|Keith Urban just keeps on getting better and better.  I love every single song on Getting Closer.  I  love this man and musician and want him \\"playng on my radio\\" all the time.  He is a keeper.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I highly advise anyone reading this review to not buy this book! If you feel you must read it, borrow it from the library! I read this book with high expectations, there are so many positive reviews. I will say, the book is thought provoking. But it provokes thoughts of how this book could have been better written!!    I agree with many of the other reviewers, Jack does not have consistant speech patterns in this book. At times he sounds very much like a 5 year old would be expected to speak, other times he has much more advanced speech. Even when Jack sounds like a 5 year old, this gets annoying really quick. The idea of telling such a story through a young child's voice is original and interesting, but the execution of the idea was horrible.     *Spoiler alert*  This story would have been better told with alternating chapters of Jack and his Ma telling the story. There are so many lose ends by the end of the story. What happens to Jack? Does he ever adapt to the outside world? What about his mother? Will she ever have a normal life? What mental hospital would let a patient who just recovered from a suicide attempt move out of the hospital and resume care of their child unsupervised?!?! There are a number of unbelievable aspects in this book, but this one bothered me the most.    Overall, the book was not a good read. I was left feeling like the book ended right before questions could be answered. There is a rushed feeling to the book after the escape. Before the escape, the story was a dull listing of what mother and son did all day. This got old real quick. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. I almost quit reading it, but the escape plot interested me again and I wanted to see how that would turn out. The first couple chapters after the escape were good, but after that the book took a turn for the worse. This book was a waste of money, I wish I would have waited to get it at the library.
B002SQ364Q|4.0|Okay, I confess, and confess so publicly, that while I am a certified proud member of the generation of '68, the political branch of that generation, I was not even remotely near Woodstock, New York on that fateful August weekend of 1969 when the myth of \\"youth nation\\" took on a certain substantive possibility that we might, after all, make a \\"newer world.\\" Others may have regrets that they did not attend but I unlike non-attendee Joni Mitchell, whose words from her song Woodstock form part of the headline for this entry, and the others am not. I, actually, was heading elsewhere, heading hard elsewhere on the highway hitchhike road in search of the blue-pink great American West night that was another branch of that same experience. That experience I am very happy that I undertook, and have written about elsewhere.     That said, we were, wherever we were, in those times, at least those of us who were fighting for some version of that \\"newer world\\" seeking, children of Woodstock. Maybe not that particular experience, after all half a million hardly exhausted the numbers who were \\"searching\\" in those days, but some experience be it another of the myriad musical festivals that took place in those years, or a communal living experience, or like me a highway hitchhike break-out in search of the great American West night, or just took a \\"hit\\" of dope or popped a pill that in earlier or later times would have been scorned. It is under that sign the renowned director Ang Lee has creatively taken a back story from those times, a back story centered on the locals rather than the rock stars or the \\"hippie\\" touristas associated with the name Woodstock, and meshed it with one of the locals' self-discovery in 2009, the 40th anniversary year of that event.     Whatever Woodstock, the place, and its environs were after the festival invasion before that event it was a dying Catskills resort area and farmland. That resort idea is central to the story line here. The Catskills, in theold days, before there was more widespread assimilation and Jews began to be accepted in other locales was always associated with the place where they went for vacation and as a \\"proving ground\\" for up and coming Jewish entertainers. By 1969 that idea, and those places, were passé. However, not everybody got the word, especially not an old Jewish couple who were hanging on to their mortgaged to the hilt motel for dear life, despite the best efforts of their assimilated son, the central character, of the film.     They did hold, or rather he held, an important asset: permits to allow the festival to go on. The story, the Woodstock and self-discovery story, take off from that point as we view the trials and tribulations of producing this spectacle, its actual occurrence, and the sometimes funny experiences that mother, father, and son experience, including the mandatory drug experimentation, sex (hetero and homosexual), and rock `n' roll. Is this the definitive study on Woodstock, on the 1960s counterculture, and on the generation of '68s jail break-out? No, hell no, but it is a very nicely done slice-of-life film around that seminal 1960s event. Nicely done.

More than enough storage compartments in this bag.  For the price there isn't a better backpack like this on the market.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is hands down one of the cutest and funniest children's movie I've ever seen. Whether you're 4, 11,15,18,22, or even older this movie will have you in stitches!

B002SR2PKG|5.0|I would have given this 10 stars.  I read this novel for the first time back in 1986. I was 16. I'm 41 now. This is my first review since then.  I remember going to the library and getting the hardcover edition with the original cover(over 1,100 pages long). Because the novel had just come out recently. It doesn't matter how long the novel is, because it's definitely worth the read.  Pennywise, ( killer clown/Bob Gray) aka &#34;IT&#34; gave me the chills. I was definitely scared. (I read this during the summer)  When the TV movie came out in 1991, I definitely watched it.  Tim Curry as Pennywise/IT scared the daylights out of me. He's a very good actor. As this character, he did an excellent portrayal of &#34;IT&#34;.  Whoever did the casting must have remembered him from &#34;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&#34;.  Remember John Ritter? Disappointed.  Stephen King wrote a superb novel. The characters grow up from preteens to adults. When King writes this way, it shows that you get to know them as children facing their fears growing up. It's shown in the Interludes from '58' to '85'.  When they come back together again as adults, they are stronger than when they were children. Good vs. Evil (supernatural) is definitely what King is excellent at. His writing style is beyond genius.  This is storytelling at his best.    I would recommend this novel even though there's about 933 reviews of this already. Everyone writes the same type of review for this.  Too many reviewers ruin it by writing the 'spoilers' of the novel. [the plot, ending, etc].  Hopefully by now, these types of reviews will stop, but who knows, maybe not.  For King, it's the horror genre and his best, especially &#34;IT&#34;.  For anyone willing to read and to take your time getting scared, this would be it. Read this first, then continue with his line of novels.  I recommend it.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I loved this film - I certainly recommend seeing it.  Great intrigue, some unexpected twists, Johnny Depp continues to be one of my all-time fave actors.  And I loved the ending EXCEPT I couldn't help but wonder if Hollywood didn't have the last laugh by leaving the door open for sequel(s).  I don't know about the rest of you, but I like a film that finishes definitively and I LOVE a sequel that picks up on that and continues the story.  As you might imagine, I'm not so positive about the opposite.    And I'd like to know how YOU feel:    a) Great film vs not so great?    b) Sequel too obvious or not?    c) Do we all want to marry Johnny Depp????
B0040UAYI4|4.0|This thing works exactly as promised. You won't get near the responsiveness that you get on PC due to the translation that's going on, but it's close enough. The only cons I can think of is the slight input lag and the fact that you have to spend some time configuring the device if you want to be effective.
044654759X|3.0|The book is very typical Nicholas Sparks style.  I found this one to be too much like the others.  Different characters, same story.  Kevin's character was obviously crazy but I found his constant rantings about the same thing way overboard and I really lost interest.  It's a quick read but definitely not my favorite of his.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I have read other versions of this book, but I think I like this version best because it really sounds like its her real words. I thought it was very good. :)
B001VNB54A|4.0|The Emmies gave this one Best Miniseries for its particular year.  First off, let's get the BAND OF BROTHER comparisons out of the way.  It's very different.  Less focus on heroics, no focus on one company, less time to focus on sub characters and there's nobody who owned like Spears.  In fact, this series focuses much more on the environment working against the marines (i.e. malaria, mud pits and other diseases) and especially on their mental breakdown as they witness atrocity after atrocity.  One of the arguments is that those fighting in Europe has it easier but that's up for debate, I suspect.  The miniseries follows three marines in different locations so at times the series lacks cohesion.  There's an extreme focus on the raw brutality of war as well as the overall bleakness experienced by its soldiers.  When you see Sledge trying to just get off the boat during his first island hit, well, you'll understand.  Nice touches on how most Americans didn't get what those veterans went through, especially in the last episode.  Surprisingly, my biggest letdown was that Leckie didn't get the girl I hoped he would get but I won't say anymore so as to avoid spoilers.  WHEN WATCHED: November to December 2010; STORY/PLOT POINTS: B; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus; SCOPE OF THE PACIFIC WAR: A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I selected this book solely on the number and quality of its reviews.  I was somewhat skeptical, given that I had never heard anything about it word-of-mouth.    This is a fantastic book.  Do yourself a favor and get Shantaram now.  Don't be put off by the length - you'll be sad when it is over.  My wife, who has a master's degree in lit, is reading it now and I can't pull her away from it.  I just bought it for a friend as a birthday present.
0439023513|4.0|The bittersweet finale of a trilogy focusing on a post apocalyptic society that is under the thumb of a capitol city that forces its children to fight to the death once a year on worldwide cameras.  Interesting writing style that isn't your typical past tense.  The heroine is wonderful but at the same time understandably flawed.  In the final book she seeks revenge against a President Snow who ruined her life as well as the city capitol but along the way she has to decide on which boy she will choose for her future.  WHEN READ: October to December 2010; PLOT POINTS/STORY: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; WRAP UP/SATISFYING ENDING: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.
1579128149|4.0|This book is very well described elsewhere. It is spectacular. But, I first saw this in Barnes & Noble and then bought through Amazon. On the B&N version I spotted a DVD. My Amazon edition didn't come with one. Huh? On checking more closely I found that B&N have a deluxe 'The Elements' exclusive. It costs more than this Amazon edition but the additional DVD includes an interactive periodic table and images of the elements that are capable of 360 degree manipulation. I'm not complaining, the book alone is excellent value. Anyone wanting a still more involving experience might wish to consider the B&N alternative.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|This is a great CD. On this record Lamontagne emphasizes his vocals with simple but very appropriate musical arrangements. The songs are largely reflective, with a couple down home foot stompin' gems that he is known for. I highly recommend this album for anyone who loves Ryan Adams, Gillian Welch, the Head and the Heart of similar bands.
0439023521|2.0|Gimme a break.<br /><br />This book was not frightening, it was not creepy, it was barely compelling. It's well written and the story moves quickly but it is not at all what I expected. All the praise and word-of-mouth I heard made me believe this would be a dark, disturbing, and fascinating tale of a post-apocalyptic fight to the death where innocent teenagers were thrown into a gladiator-style arena and forced to compete for their lives. This is the backdrop of the book but not the story. It's essentailly about a girl who camps, forages the woods for berries and rabbits, hides, gets lucky, finds herself in the right place at the right time and then ends up in a sappy, forced romance that will make you barf.<br /><br />I never felt that the main character \\"Katniss\\" was ever threatened. There was plenty of contrived danger out there, but I never once worried about her. I knew all along that she would be just fine. As for the dark, creepy world the author creates, it's nothing special. Nothing you haven't read before. Teenagers killing each other: Lord of the Flies...A post-apocalypitc arena filled with gladiators: The Running Man. An oppressive governement that controls it's citizens: 25% of every book ever written. There was nothing shocking in this book - not the violence, not the circumstances, not the setting. I was not distrubed - I was just bored. In fact, the most disturbing thing about this book, is how \\"disturbed\\" all of the writers of these 5* reviews are.<br /><br />This book is nothing special - it filled 4 hours, good for a long plane trip or vacation.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I love this movie!  So far in the past two weeks we have watched it five times and it hasn't gotten old yet!  The movie is about a villan name Gru who is evil but hilarious.  He plans the biggest heist of his career and with the help of his minions (little yellow creatures) they almost pull it off.  In comes Vector who is another villian trying to make a name for himself and does his own crazy heist.  To beat Vector, Gru adopts three little girls and uses them in his plan, but he of course falls for them.  It is a great movie and between Gru's accent and the minions, we all laughed throughout the movie!

030746363X|5.0|Tim's book Four Hour Body, was one that I initially rolled my eyes at. As a former anorexic, I imagined it would be another gimmicky, scientific based diet that would be ridiculously difficult to follow and way more attractive to my boyfriend, building his muscle, than me.<br /><br />Was I ever wrong.<br /><br />I picked up this book and read with my boyfriend a few days before Christmas Eve after getting 2 copies in the mail. And I haven't stopped eating it up.<br /><br />Tim's scientific studies, supporting information, and justification for the \\"rules\\" and myths of eating that are so ingrained in my head make sense to me. I'm normally quite stubborn in my own eating habits and don't like to be told I'm wrong. But this stuff just makes sense. And it's working--I can say that already even when I'm heading into Day 5 of reading. Now focusing on my week ahead and feeling confident with eating, with body and lifestyle management, I'm embracing this with gusto. My past beliefs and ideas about nutrition have been blown out of the water. I'm feeling better than ever about eating--and that's a big deal to me.<br /><br />Thank you, Tim. Home run, baby.
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|Well, first of all, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this album. At first, I was hesitant to watch their show on Nick but after a couple episodes I really started to like them and their music.  In 2010, I bought a huge amount of CD's that were released this year and I have to say that BTR was my favorite album of the enire year.  I just found myself listening to it over and over when I was cleaning, organizing, or even working...I really liked it.  I have probably played it about 50 times all the way through.  Ok, enough of my blabbering.  This is how I am going to review it: I'm going to talk about each song in this album, so here I go...    1. Til I Forget About You...5/5  This song was really catchy and it's nice to listen to when you need a little of energy or to make you happy.  I think that this was a great way to start off the album.     2. Boyfriend...4/5  I was never a huge fan of this song even when it came out on the show but I have to say that it is actually quite nice and catchy.  It's what teen boys go throught with their first loves and overall it is nice.    3. City Is Ours...5/5  Another great upbeat song by the boys.  Nice and catchy and I really enjoy it everytime I listen to it.    4. Nothing Even Matters...5/5  This song is also really nice and I really like that Logan is the main performer in this song; he doesn't get many solos.  It's nice the whole way through.    5. Worldwide...5+/5  This song is one of my favorite songs ever.  I really love the way James and Logan execute this song.  Their vocals are great and they did an amazing job.  Carlos and Kendall are also showcased in this song and it makes it even better that all four of them actually have a part in the whole song.  I just really like the way James sings here...and I have to say he is my favorite singer from all of them but I like all four.    6. Halfway There...5+/5  Amazing!!! I really like the message of this song A LOT!!! It's meaningful and it empowers you to reach for the stars and to achieve all your dreams.  My favorite saying in this song is Logan's solo.  A great, powerful song.    7. Big Night...5/5  This song is great because it makes you want to get up and move.  It's just an upbeat song with great vocals.     8. Oh Yeah...4/5  This is probably my least favorite song in the whole cd.  I enjoy it but not as much as the other tracks.    9. Count on You...5+++/5  This one and Worldwide are my favorite ever.  I have never been a fan of Jordin Sparks but this song made me see her in a different light; it made me appreciate her voice.  I don't have words to describe this song; I just love it to death.  She and the guys did an amazing performance.  AMAZING!!!    10. I Know You Know...5/5  This is another great song.  I really like it and the girl here is great too.  The guys' voices really fit the beat of the song.    11. Big Time Rush Theme...5/5  Who doesn't like this song?  It introduced us to these guys.  It plays over and over on the T.V. show and it's just great and fun.      EXTRA: I have the album that has STUCK and THIS IS OUR SOMEDAY as extra tracks and I have to say those are also amazing, especially Stuck.  I believe that Stuck should've been on the final album but I don't know whey it wasn't included.  It's great, and I'm pretty sure that fans would've loved it even more.      Well, I hope you like my review.  I never thougth that this was going to be so great.  I'm 23, and I'm happy to say I love Big Time Rush!!!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Purchased this item mainly on price $3.99 - Great Deal! Purchased as a Christmas gift.  Great movie, have it in Blue Ray as well.
0738212415|5.0|I have used this book to learn the basics of realistic drawing with great pleasure. If you can give it 20 minutes or so a day, and follow the steps outlined, you will improve your sketching ability greatly. The step by step instructions and the encouragment given by Mark makes this a fun to use resource.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|The whole show is stupid from the beginning of season 1.  It's nothing more than a daytime soap opera with a bigger budget to allow for more special effects.  There were never any rules of the world that was created other than there are no rules, so essentially anything goes from episode 1 of season 1.  Lame!  That's exactly what happened throughout, ideas were made up and implemented as the show moved along, and over the course of 6 seasons the \\"geniuses\\" behind this lame show found themselves boxed in a corner with no winning way out.  They were actually boxed in a corner long before and at a certain point just kept getting more \\"lost\\" in their box to a point of no return other than more and more garbage.  The ending was actually fitting for such a stupid show.
0440180295|5.0|My senior year of High school my english teacher was fresh out of college and brought in a great deal of \\" new blood\\" to the lit dept. This book was enjoyed by myself and my classmates! Highly recamended for academic or pleasure reading.
B000063NPX|5.0|We just love this movie.  Have watched it twice now. The fact that it's a \\"Special Edition\\" makes it even more special.  Glad we have it to enjoy over and over.  Thanks.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I'm currently watching \\"The Pacific\\" right now and it is completely off the hook! A few times, I laughed my ass off, especially the scene on Guadalcanal where the Marines pillage Army loot and then race away from the incoming MP's, then with the Marine officer telling the thief who stole the moccasins and the cigars, \\"Don't let them catch you with those.\\" while the officer is currently holding a stolen crate of liquor! Then the scene where the gunnery sergeant on a firing range curses at a surprised officer who was waving his weapon around casually down the line and throws a few bullets in his face while doing so.<br /><br />There are many complaints about this movie, about how \\"it's hard to follow the battles\\" and \\"inaccurate maps.\\" Well, I found it easy to follow the battles because I WATCHED the battle scenes, and as an Army veteran, found it to be some pretty good scenes of when Sgt. John Basilone and his men mow down hundreds of Jap troops in their suicide charge. I like when Pvt. Sledge enters the movie for good, since I read his book, \\"With the Old Breed\\" and some of the battle scenes match his own experiences. Sledge is shown as a rookie in the Corps getting to get the feel of the campaigns that he participates in, and by the end of the war, he has made the rank of Corporal, and the survivor of two bloody campaigns. Sledge has passed away ten years ago, but I think he would've liked to see this movie, despite what the critics say. I even own \\"Band of Brothers\\" and when I ordered this movie, I thought, \\"About time!\\" It would be good to have a miniseries of what happened in the Pacific while at the same time the Airborne boys in France, Holland, and Belgium mow down Nazis.<br /><br />Order this movie and it won't be a waste! Unless you have no stomach for war scenes full of men that helped to earn the freedom that these pacifist and liberal critics take advantage of today.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|Yes, modern - and not so modern - media have bombarded us with version after version of this classic tale. Some have been good, some have been ridiculously horrible (e.g. Kelsey Grammer in a \\"musical version\\"....aaarrrrgghhh!!!). However, none of these forms have ever accurately conveyed the imagery so wonderfully as the original written text by Dickens. Though written some 150 years ago the mastery of the English language portrayed in the book can never be duplicated by video. Take for example Dicken's description of Scrooge as a \\"squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner!  Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\"  Tremendous ! Or Scrooge's nephew Fred's description of the season as \\"a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time: the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely\\" The literary version also contains numerous snippets of marvelous text such as Dickens desciption of Scrooge waiting for the first spirit when he notes that Scrooge could \\" no more go to sleep than go to Heaven \\". Or when waiting for the second spirit that he was: \\"ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much\\". I know of no media version other than the written text which delivers these literary gems.    In the book, Dickens notes that he is \\"standing in the spirit at your elbow\\".  Do yourself a favor. Read the book !  Give Dickens a chance to spend some time in the spirit at your elbow and you thoroughly enjoy what he notes in the preface is a \\"Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it. Their faithful Friend and Servant\\"    Go ahead, give him a chance.
1577314808|4.0|Just finished the book and can say it was pretty good,especially the first half. This is something anyone can practice (Nowness) and make oneself more alert.     The book got off track a little talking about men/women/civilization issues that make it not a completely self improvement guide. I sense a lot of the information is quite similar to Scientology- isness, present time (now), body-pain (engram) and the issue of our civilization. Wonder if he got some of the ideas from Ron Hubbard/Scientology? Nevertheless, this was a better than average book.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|I loved this movie. Great story, great action, great acting.   This one kept you watching and you found yourself rooting for the bad guys.  4 friends from a tight knit neighborhood pull capers.  Enjoy
B001ECQ75A|5.0|You will certainly love this product. you need to get this if you don't have it. it is great. yes
B000Y9Q59W|5.0|Excellent movie, just watched it last night for the first time ever, do not know what i was waiting for.  Classic story of good vs. bad.  Capitalisim vs. socialism  I guess it depends on which side of the fence you are on to side with one side over the other.
B003UESJH4|5.0|While I had expected to like this movie, I actually loved it.  Very well-written, brilliantly acted by all, wonderful production values (from costumes to settings),  directed crisply (it was just as long as it needed to be so there was no checking of watches) and a wonderful, touching, true story.  Plus, no special effects, no loud music, no overlong endings.  This is what, imho, an excellent movie should be.    Run, don't walk, to see it.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I first saw this picture when it was initially released in IMAX format. I had never read the graphic novel but after a stellar review in the NY Post and having an afternoon to kill I went to see it and was totally blown away. So much so that I went back the next day to see it again while it was fresh in my mind. I have since read the graphic novel and have re-watched the movie perhaps ten times, most recently, the Director's Cut in Blue Ray. WOW!!! In some ways it is superior to the novel, most obviously in the fact that it is absolute eye-candy and I think the characterizations by the cast is exactly right. The scenes and music during the opening credits (Dylan singing, \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\") are worth the price of the disc alone.  In brief, this film deserves to be seen by anyone who loves great movie-making and if you are a fan of the graphic novel and have not seen this movie you deserve a visit from Rorschach at about 3am.
0525951652|2.0|i am a huge Follett fan, but i was terribly disappointed by this book.  I would never have associated this book's shortcomings with an author possessed with such talent.  Can't explain it.    Poorly written, very boring, it was very difficult to finish, and i wonder why i did.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Pixar is known for quality work, they will not do anything unless it is top notch. I was highly doubtful that even Pixar could equal the sequel, so to speak. The story telling is excellent, the animation amazing, and the voice acting stellar! It is truly a fitting crown jewel to the Toy Story saga. Fun for kids of all ages! shame on him who thinks evil of this!
B00009W0U4|2.0|If the purpose of this movie is to make the viewer uncomfortable, then, congrats, mission accomplished.  The problem with this, of course, is that ipecac, roller coasters, and soiled baby diapers do the same thing.<br /><br />Warning:<br />If you are prone to motion sickness, have vertigo or epilepsy, or got ill when watching the camera work in Cloverfield, then you probably shouldn't watch this movie.  Because it's far worse.  Ten times worse.  And at times even amateur.<br /><br />Having said all that, this is nothing more than the typical rape-revenge tale, but told backwards like Memento.  I'm not completely opposed to the rape-revenge genre; it's often entertaining to cheer on the revenge aspect.  There is even a decent performance turned in by Vincent Cassel (The Messenger, Eastern Promises) as the enraged boyfriend of Monica Belluci.  Kudos to her as well; she endured what has to be the longest, most realistic, and most brutal rape scene in movie history.  It makes [[ASIN:B002DKGWSE Last House on the Left]] seem like a date movie.  The graphic brutality of the eventual revenge - a completely barbaric and primal display of raw emotion displaying the fire extinguisher's density advantages over the human facial bones - is almost too realistic.  To make matters worse, the movie eventually removes all the morbid gratification of the revenge - the one justifiable reason for watching movies of this genre.<br /><br />All of that, however, does not make up for a weak script, the pointless and color-blind camerawork, and needlessly long, uninterrupted scenes and front-loaded significant content that makes the 97 minute running time feel MUCH longer.  This is pretentious, pseudo-intellectual art-house nonsense; it lacks insight and has no actual resolution.<br /><br />At one point a primary character, Pierre, says of another's actions, \\"F--- B-movie revenge crap.\\"  That pretty much sums it up.  It may be trite, but watching this movie is irreversible.<br /><br />Jason Elin

B001R9THMK|5.0|Excellent sandal, which is very comfortable even when wearing for the first time.  Relaxed, yet firm fit which conforms to the foot.  The tensioning laces are easy to tighten & appear to stay fixed in the adjusted position.  I have not yet had them wet and worn them to dry, but I do not anticipate that as a future issue.  A very comfortable sandal to walk in with good support & comfort.   Highly recommend.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I love this show, so I had to buy all 3 seasons because Amazon has an amazing price. The shipping was super fast, my package showed up the first day of their estimated shipping date. The contents were in perfect condition!

B001NXDSLQ|3.0|I'm a child of the Sixties. Was overseas in the Army in 1969. Love that era's music. (Beatles, Stones, Animals, Doors, Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Simon & Garfunkel, Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, The Temptations, Four Tops, Wilson Pickett, Creedence Clearwater, Santana, and so many others.)<br /><br />My only problem with the film is the music. Some was great (Joe Cocker, Santana, Sly, CS&N), some awful (Joplin, Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane), but too much just mediocre. Why did Joan Baez, John Sebastion, and Arlo Guthrie leave their best songs at home?  How did Sha Na Na even get invited, much less make the editor's cut? What of the other musicians we hear about who performed at Woodstock?<br /><br />I'm selling my copy and hoping to live long enough for another version to come out. One retaining all the wonderful documentary footage but bringing us a better selection of music.<br /><br />The 50th Anniversary Edition? I can only hope I live so long.
B000T1JJFC|4.0|=== Update 3/25/13 ===<br />Benefit is my favorite Jethro Tull album, period!  The quality of the recording on this particular purchase is as good as I've ever heard.  Every time I hear this album, I just smile.<br /><br />However, after listening to this album over the past 40 years or so, one just gets used to the order of the songs.  Fact is, the order of the songs on many albums & CDs is usually a deliberate choice made by the producers and musicians.  What kind of galled me about this particular recording is that someone took it upon themselves to rearrange the order of the songs!  In my opinion, that they added new tracks to the existing list doesn't make up for such a seemingly ham fisted decision.<br /><br />That being said, I doubt Ian Anderson ever lost any sleep over it, and it's not really a compelling reason for anyone to not purchase this recording!  It's just a bit if a shame that those who have never heard this recording before now will not hear it as it was originally intended if they only listen to this particular release.  Notwithstanding, it's still excellent music, that has held its own over the years!<br />=== End Update ===<br /><br />=== Original Review ===<br />Still the same music, I could hear no differences from earlier edits.  However, what I didn't like was how they added other tracks, and then changed the order of the original track list!  And, wouldn't you know, even if you rename and rearrange the songs in the folder, and remove the extra tracks to another folder, Windows Media Player can still figure out how everything is supposed to go, promptly finds all of the tracks, puts them back into order, and negates your careful edit job!  Oh well, at least I can copy the tracks to my no-name MP3 player, and still hear the songs in their original order... without the extra tracks... just as it should be!<br /><br />Oh well, I guess it's kind of like complaining about your job.  We should count ourselves lucky to still have one (those of uswho still do, that is...), and count ourselves lucky that this music is still available!  And, hey, we do get the bonus tracks as a consolation prize, right?<br /><br />Would that some people in the recording industry would get an actual clue... Oh well, such is life I suppose!
B0042RJWTM|5.0|Lee Marvin in a perfect role!!!  The story itself is an awesome portrayal of both friendship and love in the changing west.  The remake was great, but, this original version is even better thanks to the chemistry between Marvin and Jack Palance.  The supporting characters were great too. A true classic!!!
0671449028|5.0|I started sleep-training my son when he was a little under 4 months old.  To establish a bed-time routine, I decided to buy a bed-time book to read to him.  I researched on Amazon and bought this book because of so many great reviews.  This book didn't disappoint me.  My baby absolutely loves the book! Sometimes when he was too excited to fall asleep by himself I would hold his little hand, look at his eyes and start to read \\"the sun has set not long ago...\\".  He would instantly calm down and threw me a cute smile.
B000W91RUG|3.0|The package arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I enjoyed this season.  It's funny and you get to understand the characters.  The second season is funnier, but only because you have the back stories from this season.
0452295548|5.0|A fabulous book written by an incredibly brave lady who against all odds found good in something so devastating.  Should be read then passed on to Doctors Nurses and anyone looking after someone ill. Could be read by everyone just to learn how precious life is and to treat other people kindly especially if they are ill.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|This arrived in time and in perfect condition.  This season was great.  Very funny.  This is the year most of the recurring inside jokes started.  It was great to go back and see how they started.
B0000CDJPQ|4.0|It works. I'm using it to transfer digitized slide film images from a Nikon scanner and am getting clean, sharp images. It's not an absolutely tight fit so care must be taken, particularly with the Nikon's thick Firewire cord, to keep the plug centered in the socket -- bumping the cord can cause a loss of connection. But if you set things up right, it won't budge on its own. And you can't beat the price!
0425205061|1.0|I purchased a NEW book and to my chagrin, when the giftee opened up the box, it contains a USED book. Had a label on the back that said it was Used, in good condition. If the book was not available New, I shouldn't have been charged full price...
B0015OKWL2|4.0|DeNiro is the master of this genre and doesn't disappoint in this film.  Unlike Pacino, DeNiro suspends all disbelief in the authenticity of his character with his very natural style.  The chemistry between him and Pacino is good.  However, one is often aware that Pacino is acting as he forces his character on the audience.  His over-acting is often unintentionally humorous as it was in \\"Scarface.\\"  Nevertheless, the script and direction are very good in this excellent thriller.
0394873742|4.0|This item was a big hit with an 18 month old.  My grandson immediately squatted down in front of it when we held it up (it's large maybe 18x30) and he excitedly pointed at everything he recognized.  Despite all the other toys he received he kept going back to this favorite.  It is a little unwieldy but if flat on the floor he can crawl over it looking at every little detail.  Richard Scarry is awesome.

B002FOQY2M|3.0|As a huge Format fan, i was very dissapointed in this album.<br />I gave it 3 stars only because Nate continues to flex his already incredible voice through out.<br />I found all the extra, digital sounding, instruments to be over the top and concealing of the bands strongest aspect. Again, Nate's voice.<br />i expected a lot more and rightly so. With all the potential and talent fun. has amassed behind them. This should have been a power house of an album.<br />Instead we get a weak, noisy, let down.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|This is an amazing album.  The kind that grows and grows on you like moss, taking on bigger shapes and forms and meanings with each listen.  I am a member of Flowers's church and have really enjoyed the religious tone of much of this album.  Much like a lot of his lyrics with the Killers, the lyricist leaves the lyrics open for the listener to interpret for themselves and whereby 'make the songs their own.'  This is an extraordinary gift and Flowers has it.  Flamingo is a deep soul-searching album that has consoled me on many a-day, helping me realize that I stand not alone in my struggles and and at times doubts in life.  Life is a process for each and every one of us.  This album is about that individual process.  Make it your own!    Other Comparable Albums I have been listening to:    Johnny Cash American V : A Hundred Highways  Josh Ritter : Golden Age of Radio  Bob Dylan : Freewheelin' Bob Dylan    All of these are amazing albums, Flowers sings his album at a younger age than Cash and doesn't achieve the sort of simple wisdom that Cash is able to convey with American V, but nonetheless Flamingo runs deep indeed!    Out on a Wire is EPIC!
030746363X|5.0|After the Four Hour Work Week, Tim Ferriss became, by far, my favorite author.    In tune with all his writing, this book over-delivers on some pretty lofty claims. Most authors don't go through the extensive research and real-world testing that Tim subjected himself to before writing this book. In true form, the Four Hour Body covers what 10 other books would, but written so you don't want to put a gun in your mouth after page 5.    Really, if you're at all interested in the subject matter (living longer, better sex, athletic performance, a diet that actually works) just buy this book now.    If you don't like it, I'll buy it off you and give it to someone who's not so dumb...
4770031246|5.0|My mom saw this book on the Just Bento website and said she wanted it for Christmas. I decided to get it for her along with another cookbook. Once I received it, I was flipping through pages to see the overall quality. The pages were vibrant and the directions were pretty straight forward. The book is organized into sections so finding recipes is a cinch. I'm surprised to see this cookbook is sold out right now. For the price, it's a must have.     Btw Just Bento is one of the most popular Japanese cooking blogs on the web. If you're looking for good Japanese cooking, check out Makiko Itoh's blogs.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This is a film that Roland Emmerich made for disaster movie junkies.    Emmerich started his homage to the subgenre with Independence Day, developed it into a fine stew with Day After Tomorrow and puts it completely over the top with 2012.  In this film, he intentionally pushes the genre completely over the edge and I don't see how he can make another disaster movie after this unless he tries to completely reinvent the form.    As I watched the film, I kept thinking back to Earthquake, The Posiden Adventure, Twister and any number of other films that he winked at on the way past.  He has taken some of these special effect concepts and tweaked them to the point where all you can do is laugh.  They are completely dazzling, but also so far over the top that he is actually making a comment on the very nature of disaster movies while dazzling.    As if to punctuate that point, he has terrific actors in cardboard roles.  If Charlton Heston made you laugh in Earthquake, John Cusack and Woody Harrelson will absolutely crack you up in this film.  It is so absurd that all you can do is laugh.    It's not exactly a put on, but Emmerich's tongue is very deeply in his cheek.  I laughed all the way through the movie.

B003VS0CX8|3.0|The Blu Ray is good, but if you have a good upcoverting bluray player and own this on DVD, save your money.  The Blu Ray version is not so much better that you need to buy this version too.  It's a great movie and one of my all time favorites.  I gave it three stars because it is way over-hyped special edition that tries to get you to feel you must own this new Blu Ray version.  However the difference between the DVD and Blu Ray is small.  The hype is too high.  If you don't own Sound of Music, then buy the Blu Ray. You'll be getting the best available version possible.  If you own this on VHS tape, you may want to upgrade too.  But if you own a DVD, think twice.  It is really not worth the extra money.

030746363X|4.0|Tim Ferriss is a master marketer.  He has pushed this book up to #1 on the NYT best seller list. He could well be the Ron Popeil of the Internet age.    But wait! There's more!  In the marketing of this book, Ferriss uses hype and hyperbole. In many cases, within the book, he uses hype and hyperbole. Without hype and hyperbole, not a whole lot of people buy self-help books.     But wait! There's more! The basic diet and nutrition stuff has been around for a while. The basic strength information has been around for a while. The basic fitness and athletic performance has been around for a while.  And I'm not sure that the female anatomy is anything really new.     But wait! There's more! Tim Ferriss has taken this information, packaged it with a lot of personal anecdotes, and presented it in an enthusiastic and entertaining manner. The result:    * Some people who wouldn't touch a South Beach or Atkins book are going to try restricted carbohydrate diets.  They will lose weight.   * Some people whose entire idea of exercise is 16-ounce lifts after work, are going to be swinging kettlebells. They will become more fit.  * Some folks, both male and female, who would never buy a \\"sex\\" book, will read a few chapters while no one else is around, and will try some new things, and may enjoy them.    Tim Ferriss' primary message in his first book (The 4-Hour Workweek) is that if you don't like your work environment, and how you spend most of your time, get off your backside and change it. Here are ways you can do that.  The message of this book is if you don't like your physical well being, get off your backside and change it. And here are ways you can do this. Many are well-known, but a some are not, at least to the general public. There is nothing particularly magical about losing weight, being fit, or running a marathon. All it takes is the will to make the change.  While the hype may offend diet and fitness purists, (I assume sex experts are non-offendable) they aren't thetarget audience.      The end result, is that a certain number of this book's readers are going to have measurably happier lives. A far larger number of readers will find it interesting (or not interesting) to varying degrees, and not do a doggone thing.  I may, (or more likely may not) run a marathon some day. And Tim Ferriss will make another pile of money popularizing health and fitness in an unconventional way. It's hard to find a whole lot wrong with any of that.      A PS to the original review:  There are a lot of objections out there based upon the laws of thermodynamics. Calories in vs calories out, and so forth. This is true as far as it goes. If you increase your metabolism, you burn more calories. A lot of Tim's advice falls into the metabolism-boosting regime. The other is that calories excreted, in #1 or #2 fashion, aren't an active part of your weight-calorie balance. If the \\"excess\\" calories bother you, that's where they go.    The cheat day, (binge) regimen as part of your diet to maintain insulin levels has been around for a long time. I had a trainer tell me about it some 10 years ago, and it wasn't new then.    I'm not necessarily a Ferriss fanboi. I think the book is overhyped, (anyone offended by that, I understand) and I certainly wouldn't do everything in it. And a lot of it was apparently previewed on his blog. But it is very interesting, and it has exposed me to a number of ideas that I wouldn't know of otherwise.
B003XT60KO|4.0|Hazlitt is one of the prominent voices in the Austrian flavor of Economics.  This version of Economics has recently come to the mainstream in light of the economic hardships and out of control spending from the federal government.  This book is dated but contains a lot of relevant information.  I was surprised to see just how big of a concern inflation and deficit spending was in the 40s to these very intelligent and honest economists.<br /><br />What will you find inside?  Well the bottom line is everything you do, no matter how noble, affects someone else in the world of economics.  If the government steps in to help one group of people it is hurting another group of people, usually resulting in a net harm.  This is because anytime you artificially stimulate, subsidize or promote one behavior over another you are promoting inefficiency or protecting the least profitable option.  This raises prices on goods and decreases real wages.  The only way to create wealth and grow the economy is to produce more of a product with the same or less effort.  This will in the long run make everyones cost of living lower and bring more prosperity to the country.  A great example he used was the hypothetical situation where the government continued to subsidize the horse and buggy industry despite the innovation of the automobile.  Sure jobs were lost when cars started replacing horse drawn carriages but eventually more jobs were created and the country was a whole lot better off.  He also dispels the myth of saving too much money and discusses why it's necessary to save and what your savings accomplishes.<br /><br />Other discussions include real world examples of why labor unions are harmful to the economy, why it's bad to raise minimum wage, evils of price fixing, the problem with subsidizing, rent stabilization and who it hurts, inequities and harm of tariffs, and much much more.  I deduct a star from the book because it got a little repetitive after awhile.  A lot of the arguments are repeated and there is a definite recurring theme in every problem he poses.  This is not to detract from it's validity, and each problem does propose a unique flavor of this principle.  A lot of these things I knew were intuitively  wrong but the examples he gives makes you nod your head and puts your gut thought into words.  This book was a refreshingly easy read and very insightful.ments are repeated and there is a definite recurring theme in every problem he poses.

B003PIUBZS|2.0|First, let me share some demographic info ... I'm nearly 40.  While my taste in film has changed over time, I still can enjoy sex and violence in a movie or TV show if it advances the story.  For example, The Sopranos had plenty of both, but I never felt like it was there for the sake of ratings.<br /><br />This show is filmed in a vibrant, graphical style, complete with slow motion decapitations and brilliantly red blood splatters.  And plenty of skin is shown throughout the show.  The problem I have is that it seems that makes up 80% of the show, with 20% actual story.  I'm sure this show will appeal greatly to certain demographics (I would have loved it when I was 12, for example), but overall I give the show two thumbs down.  I would not say it is terrible, but in today's world of quality TV programming, this show is definitely below average in my opinion.<br /><br />That is just my opinion - I will say that technically the show is well done.  The visuals (comic-book style) are impressive and unique as far as TV shows goes.  So for the right viewer, this could be a fine viewing experience.  But for viewers who like to focus more on story, I fear you will be disappointed by the series.

0679422714|2.0|I have been a big fan of Jung Chang's best seller: The Wild Swans, but not this one. It was so hard for me to finish reading it, as I grew up in China and have know some history of it.<br />On the other hand, this is Jung's portrait of history when she was just a teenage and her family suffered a lot during the Culture Revolution in China. Only objective history can tell that the creation of disaster was not all Mao's fault, and Mao's personal life can not be solely judged in western's values. Mao grew up at times when China had a emperor in Qing Dynasty, and many people of his generation have held similar views on family and wives, including people living in Hong Kong when it was still a British colony.<br />One thing I may add, right after the book was published, I was so excited and couldn't wait to read it and bought 3 copies together from Amazon. Before reading it, I planned to buy more to share with my friends in China, as I didn't think that they could get the book there. Had it been as a good book as Jung's previous one, I'd have bought more than 10 copies. Now, I have felt shamed, as I have given one copy to my sister and another to my best friend. Both of them are professors at colleges in China. This book may be worthy of reading if you are interested in China as outsiders, but not to Chinese intellectuals. They may benefit from reading more English books though.

B000AY74OG|1.0|This was never designed for kids to watch alone.  Much of the movie has adult oriented jokes and scene reproductions from older adult movies that kids simply just wouldn't get (For example; drug induced hallucinations).  For kids it offers cartoons acting silly and has questionable entertainment value and certainly little real educational or learning value.    I as an adult give it three stars as i rather enjoy lemurs calling other animals \\"Pansies\\" and the penguins are very funny but for kids it is one star.
1416562605|4.0|***1/2    A witty if rather cynical novel, White Tiger tells a story of India through the eyes of Balram Halwai, an impoverished village boy from \\"the darkness\\" who manages, through a combination of subservience and cunning, to become a driver for a wealthy landlord, and finally, after a terrible act, a self-made entrepreneur. Balram serves as a sort of sardonic tour guide for the two halves of India that he sees; there are the poor: miserable, forever indentured to menial jobs, and finding initiative only to prevent other poor from rising above them; and there are the rich: corrupt, malicious (or, at best, weak-willed), unapologetically self-serving, and indifferent to the poor. I've noticed that more than a few Indian readers online have criticized the accuracy of Adiga's skewed depiction of the country, but, as an American, I found it an eye-opening read and perhaps not a bad starting point for literary excursions into India. Sometimes, the picture it paints is darkly funny. Sometimes, it's upsetting.    As a novel, White Tiger has a few flaws. Balram's description and wit often hit their targets, but he himself never becomes a very involving character. Mostly, he's just a passive observer until the plot requires him to do something significant. Even the crime he commits has a perfunctory, self-serving aspect that does little to make him a more likeable, interesting, or powerful character. (And why he chooses to tell his life story to the Chinese premier via email, I don't know, though it's an amusing device.)    Still, I got something from Adiga's scathing humor and his tragicomic portrayal of a life caught between poverty and wealth, and servitude and freedom. Being a short read/listen, White Tiger didn't overstay its welcome.
B004APVI1G|5.0|I received this movie in the 3D combo pack. My thoughts are strictly concerning the 3D blu ray for home viewing. I have seen many 3D blu ray movies since acquiring my 3D set last summer. This film is hands down the best looking 3D movie I have watched so far. Beautiful backgrounds, great story and characters, intense battle scenes, and awesome 3D rendering makes this a must-have if you have a 3D tv.
0756405890|4.0|An entertaining fantasy novel that will delight fans of Robert Jordan, Orson Scott Card, JK Rowling, and other luminaries of the genre. Obviously a fantasy buff himself, Rothfuss wears his influences on his sleeve (literally -- trust a guy who dons a Joss Whedon shirt for his web site photo). Plenty of direct comparisons to various well-loved series can be made: the setting feels reminiscent of that of the Wheel of Time series, the gifted and reckless young hero a little like Ender, and the school for Arcanists a little like Hogwarts. But Rothfuss weaves these familiar elements into the fabric of a story that's all his own. Be patient, reader -- it takes about 80 pages for the tale to really get started, but once it does, it will suck you in with an involving world; a protagonist who's flawed and likable despite the fact he's naturally better at most things than most people (and knows it), and an enjoyable mix of fantastic and familiar problems. Even my mom liked it.    The book does have a few flaws, though. First, Rothfuss's writing can be a bit adverb-happy and overly precious about his character's emotional lives. He's clearly in it for the long haul, and readers aren't going to find a clean story arc, but 700 pages of setup for future volumes. A bit of editing wouldn't have hurt a few sections, such as the plodding opening. In a way, the book reminds me of one of those adventure video games in which there's a main quest, and lots and lots of little side quests.    Well, Rothfuss is all about the joy of those side quests, which will please some readers more than others. He's unapologetically writing for an audience for whom the whole point of reading fantasy is to get lost in an imaginary world. And there's plenty to get lost in here. The Name of the Wind is an enjoyable coming-of-age story filled with life and discovery. If subsequent books follow suit, this ambitious cycle will no doubt attract as much fan adoration as George RR Martin's Fire and Ice series. Can't wait for the next one!

0307454541|4.0|***1/2<br /><br />I'm not normally a big fan of mystery thrillers, but I found this one entertaining, if a little over-hyped. The main plot is entirely conventional: a wealthy heiress disappears, leaving behind a series of unlikely clues that an intrepid journalist just happens to have the insight to piece together with the assistance of a talented hacker (who's also a romantic interest), putting him on the trail of a chilling-but-typical villain. Larsson doesn't skimp on the Hollywood-ready sensationalism, either -- look for corporate conspiracies, sado-masochism, and ex-Nazis.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed the characters and the Swedish setting. The protagonist is a likable, flawed guy, and the relationship he develops with his socially-challenged, fringe-dwelling hacker partner, Lisabeth, has dimension (even if she's a little unbelievable). They play off each other's strengths and weaknesses in an enjoyable way. I also found the book's window in Swedish culture interesting: among other differences, characters seem a bit more casual about sexual friendships than is the case in the US or UK. The writing takes on more energy and authority whenever Larson moves away from the plodding murder case and focuses on the things he seems to be most interested in: the dealings of corrupt corporations, media intrigue, and espionage. Hopefully, the sequel will go more in that direction.

0439023521|5.0|****1/2    The concept of youthful contestants pitted against another in a fight to the death in some futuristic, dystopian game show has been done before in fiction, but I don't think it's been done in a young adult novel -- at least, not as well. The Hunger Games is set in a declined, post-United States world where a decadent capitol region exerts its authority over poorer subject states by demanding teenage \\"tributes\\" to be sacrificed in its reality TV-esque Hunger Games. However, Collins doesn't focus on how or why we got there. Instead, what gives the book its chilling power is its immediacy and the way its characters seem conditioned to accept the Games as an inescapable reality: the murderous eagerness of the serious competitors, the nonchalance of the capitol residents who grow mushy at players' costumes, but place no value on their lives, or the resignation of the tributes who have little apparent chance of surviving.    Collins keeps the focus tightly on her narrator, Katniss, whose vulnerability, pragmatism, and kindness make her an appealing heroine, but who shows just enough ruthlessness that we're not sure how far she'll succumb to the cynical manipulations of the game makers. Once she's thrown into the arena, the rules, landscape, and cruel tricks of the game offer plenty of twists to keep the suspense level high -- after all, only one player can come out alive. Collins makes the violence shock the old-fashioned way -- not through gore, but by lulling the reader with a calm, familiar scene, and then dropping in a terrible one. There aren't many encounters in the Hunger Games that can be called a fair fight. In this way, Collins makes it hard for readers from Generation X-box not to look beyond the fantasy and draw psychological parallels to today's world. To what depths would we let ourselves sink to be entertained? How far are we willing to go along with the cruel mandate of an unjust authority? A typical 12 or 13 year old won't have to look too farinto his or her own experience to know that the possibilities Collins is implying aren't comforting ones.    The novel has a few flaws, such as some cliched moments and characters, a cultural backdrop that could use a little more context, and the fact that its narrator, a coal miner's daugher from a poor, oppressed state where people regularly starve to death, inexplicably speaks like a prep student -- but these aren't major complaints. A gripping read for both young and older adults, and a reminder that there are still authors writing effective, readable literature-with-a-message.

0316017922|3.0|***1/2    In this book, Gladwell asks whether highly successful people, the elite athletes or powerful business leaders that society sees as \\"outliers\\", are really so different from the rest of us. Is their innate talent and drive so exceptional, or do they benefit from special advantages along the way? It's not the most controversial question -- we all understand the value of being in the right place at the right time -- but Gladwell goes deeper to examine how myriad factors like birthdays, cultural background, parenting style, and classroom time can be powerful determinants of success (or missing out on it). As with Gladwell's other books, Outliers is enjoyable for its case studies, which approach a familiar question with the kind of engaging narratives that a talented teacher might use to get his or her kids thinking about an issue from a fresh angle.    Taken as a whole, though, Outliers isn't a very cohesive work. Gladwell flits from topic to topic without much in-depth analysis or scientific rigor to tie them together. Sometimes his reasoning is overly simplistic (as in the \\"why Asians tend to be good at math\\" study) and he makes assumptions while showing little evidence to back them up. I get the impression he'd previously written a few articles on intriguing social phenomena (such as the hockey player birthday study or the way culture played into the Korean Airlines plane crashes of the 1990s), noticed a common theme, and cherry-picked a few more studies that he could massage into a book.    Then again, Gladwell's not an author you read for a deep, critical examination of an issue -- you read him because he challenges you in an entertaining way to think about a broad question. I consider this a worthwhile book if it gets more people to reevaluate the \\"self-made man\\" myth that still influences American politics, and to think about the powerful and complex roles that privilege and historical legacy can play in determining a person's success. If our society paid more heed to its structures of opportunity, there'd be many fewer children left behind, and many more who'd achieve their full potential as productive citizens. Even if Gladwell's own answers are a little fluffy, there's no doubt that he's getting us to think seriously about crucial questions.

0439023491|4.0|The Hunger Games was one of the most gripping young adult novels I've read in a while. Set in an unspecified year in the distant future, the story revolves around a teenage girl selected by lottery for a cruel to-the-death televised game show that's run yearly by an authoritarian capitol district to punish the impoverished citizens of production districts for once rebelling against it. Collins exploits her premise masterfully, turning the traps of the arena, the clever, sadistic manipulations of the games' overseers, and the fragile alliances of the other players into nail-biting twists and turns.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is also one of the smarter, more classroom-friendly young adult novels out there. Though the book contains plenty of typical sci-fi elements, its world is clearly not intended as a prediction of a likely future. It's more of an Orwellian alternate reality that reflects, indirectly, on today's world, challenging the reader, in an unobtrusive way, to think about how far we are willing to go for entertainment or how an unjust authority might use people as pawns.<br /><br />Catching Fire is roughly the sequel I would have expected. Since the world of the Hunger Games is already familiar to the reader, the book lacks the shock value of its predecessor, but Collins does a good job of keeping up a sense of fear and tension. While Katniss's victory in the Games has given her a certain celebrity, it's also gained her the enmity of a government that could squash her under its thumb at any time, and isn't coy about pointing that out. Still, Collins holds off on the inevitable confrontation, developing some of the character relationships she established in the first book, introducing some interesting new characters, and digging deeper into the tensions between the districts and the Capitol. It's a bit slow-moving until the action-filled final third, and doesn't so much advance the plot as get all the pieces in place for the third book. Most of Katniss's internal conflicts remain unresolved, as well, including her feelings for the two boys in her life, Peeta and Gale (which is just as well, because the latter never gets much screen time). But, I blazed through it and want to find out what happens in the sequel, so I won't criticize the second-book syndrome too much.<br /><br />Overall, the series has a few flaws. Some of Collins' sci-fi inventions are a little hokey, the portrayal of the villains lacks much depth, and she indulges in a bit of unnecessary melodrama (the sort where characters act obtuse just so the author can explain to readers who don't get it what's at stake). Also, I remain curious how the citizens of the Capitol, who are certainly shallow and self-centered, but don't seem especially bloodthirsty, aren't more affected by the cruelty of the Games. Is the recent \\"reality TV\\" trend really a gateway to a world of Roman Colosseum-style horrors?<br /><br />These are minor gripes, though; Catching Fire continues a gripping series and I look forward to the final book.ernal conflicts remain unresolved, as well, including her feelings for the two boys in her life, Peeta and Gale (which is just as well, because the latter never gets much screen time).

0375703861|5.0|****1/2    A smart, hilarious, and surprisingly knowing novel for an author of only twenty-three, White Teeth deserves its accolades. Beginning with the absurd failed suicide of a haplessly indecisive middle-aged Englishman named Archie, who reminds me a little of Arthur Dent from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, then moving on to his friend Samad, a hilariously self-important, argumentative Bengali (whose \\"slapping your salami\\" discussion had me snorting with laughter and trying not to drive off the road), the story eventually comes to encompass the key members of three colorfully fractious families, across several generations.    Smith writes with a keen eye for satire and an effortless authority that suggests much personal experience with born-again Jamaican grandmothers, irascible Indian housewives, white hippie-scientists with overly progressive parenting styles, and other figures that populate multicultural, urban Britain. Some readers (like my mom) might fault her for being a little too cynical with her characters, who are put into caricature boxes that they never quite manage to escape, or a little too self-indulgent (which I thought was true in spots) but, overall, I enjoyed her Catch 22-esque wit and felt that it was rooted in compassion, offering surprisingly mature insights into culture clashes, growing up, growing older, and the mental contortions people put themselves through in order to put on a front for the world or themselves, despite what they actually feel inside.    White Teeth isn't a very plot-driven book, taking snapshots of its central figures and their lives through multiple decades, but it's this epic sweep, I think, that really gives Smith's novel resonance. From beneath the comic posturing and postulations of her characters emerges a true sense of the vital undercurrents of history, as seen by a member of the generation about to inherit it. Few writers in their 30s show such talent, let alone those among Smith's 20-something peers (back when she wrote the book, that is). Vibrant, funny, and moving -- highly recommended.    (PS: The audiobook version was excellent -- the narrator did a great job with all the accents.)

B001DPHDCY|5.0|Dr. Seuss is like a childhood staple, and it is so wonderful to see the everlasting presence he has on literature, even today.  With my unending love for the writer, I'm actually shocked it took me this long to actually see `Horton Hears a Who' but I finally did and I must say that I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />The film follows the tale of an Elephant named Horton who is a beloved teacher in his jungle town.  When he hears a high pitched cry for help on a tiny speck floating in mid-air, he risks his life and reputation to save it.  His former friends and neighbors, spurred on by Kangaroo, turn on him and label him a risk to the values of their community.  If you can't see it or hear it then it must not be real.  Alas, Horton is an elephant, and elephants are faithful 100%, so he presses on in his determination to find that speck a safe home.  It's a good thing too, since on that tiny little speck there is an entire world of Who's, tiny people living in a world where nothing bad ever happens.  The Mayor of Whoville joins forces with Horton to save his people from destruction at the hands of the mean spirited Kangaroo.<br /><br />Speaking volumes about acceptance, perseverance and the power of kindness, this wonderful film captures the heart and soul of Seuss and makes it perfectly accessible to your little ones.  The films themes can be taken a few different ways (depending on your personal stance), which is quite possibly the point, but the obvious moral here is one that is universally understood.<br /><br />I loved the animation choices; with rich, lush backdrops elaborating the worlds created here, and I really loved the inserts of Anime inspired segments and even classic Disney'ish moments that add splashes of color and excitement.<br /><br />The narration is also splendid and adds a poetic essence to the film.<br /><br />I really commend this film for `going there' without forgetting their key audience.  This is an animated film FOR CHILDREN and it remembers that while crafting the sequences of peril.  While there are moments of tension, nothing is so extreme that children will lose themselves in fear.  As much as I love and adore `Toy Story 3' and many other animated films as of late, it seems all too common to forget that young kids are easily shaken.  `Horton Hears a Who' understands the importance of maintaining a certain level of innocence; so when Kangaroo bows her head in shame and then, when prompted, returns a kind deed with another, you can sit back and feel content that this film not only entertained your kids, but it taught them a valuable lesson as well (without giving them nightmares).es of peril.

0671004107|5.0|Politics, theology, and sci-fi possibilities abound in this book, blended together in a brilliant manner.  Sagan develops his characters better than Arthur C. Clarke does, though that's not to say that Clarke's work is any less intriguing.  But this book addresses the \\"what if\\"s quite adeptly, illustrating the classic attempt for some people to blend religion and scientific discovery (personally, I hate the idea of \\"guided evolution\\" myself, so I could relate to the protagonist's feelings of pure scientific discovery for its own sake; here, the discussion of whether life is out there and if it's truly more advanced and benevolent as we would expect is unanswered).  Most of all, there's no happy, wonderful, flowery ending.  Nor is there a bad one, but one that -like all of Sagan's works- leaves the reader thinking.    At the end of a book, I want to ask the hard questions rather than have a forced discussion about what parts one enjoyed.  This novel enables one to do exactly the former of the two: it sets up arguments, allows for critique and belief in the possibility that we really may be \\"it\\" out there, in spite of however much searching we may hope to accomplish.  That's not an easy prospect, considering Sagan's \\"Cosmos\\" discusses the odds of discovering life and in which stages of development/advancement we'd find it; here, he lets us imagine that we may be the end of the road, and that the non-thinkers who tend to run our societies could end up ultimately lead to our ruination rather than let those who think out-of-the-box take the world by the hand and lead us forth.  Hard stuff indeed.  Great book, highly recommended.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|`Winter's Bone' has me straddling the fence with my own opinion, because I find myself completely torn as to how I really feel about it.  It is, in most respects, a very good film.  But (and there is that pesky `but') there are elements of this film, key elements at that, that seem off-kilter.  Often referred to as that little Indie that could, `Winter's Bone' has achieved a lot of praise and accolades this Awards season; in fact, it's sitting pretty for some key Oscar nominations, including Actress, Screenplay and Picture.  For me though, this film kind of boils down to one person; Debra Granik.  With a script that can become repetitive and obtuse, to acting that runs the gamut from unapologetically stereotypical to downright sincere and believable (so, in other words, uneven), it all comes together thanks to Granik's marvelous direction.  She understands the chills needed in the atmosphere to get under the audiences skin and create something unforgettable out of a story that is, to put it bluntly, rather forgettable.  `Winter's Bone' has a lot of fans, and I am kind of one of them.  As much as I rag on some of the films generalities, I did enjoy it and certainly would recommend it.  Jennifer Lawrence has some very good moments as the determined Ree, even if I found her handling of some lesser scenes to be awkward and unbelievable.  John Hawkes is the star of the show, for he really creates someone phenomenally centered and conflicted and haunted from start to finish.  It's the dark and spooky climate the makes the movie though, and Granik manipulates it with stellar results.  While it doesn't emotionally connect like it claims to (it is notably cold and distant, but I feel that was intentional and even commendable, to a degree) it does leave an impression thanks to Granik's attention to detail.
B000HLDFM2|5.0|I think oldboy is one of the best film of our times. This edition is perfect for anybody who is in love with the film. Also if you are a film buff, their are lots of extras that you will like.
0307278255|2.0|I am reading this book for a book club and I really want to like it, however I find it depressing.  The word Monotony comes to mind.  I have read books with depressing stories but this one seems to have senseless depression.  The characters have such potential and you have hopes that things will get better but they don't and the story just ends.  Everyone has problems but the characters in this book seem to suck the life out of the reader.  Instead of Unaccustomed Earth perhaps it should have been Misery on Earth.  Couldn't wait for it to end!
1615230823|5.0|I don't know when I have talked about a book I was reading as much as this one!  Some very interesting ideas and theories - many ideas you have thought yourself but couldn't express it as well as this.  Very well written and easy to read.  I highly recommend this book.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I will say this show takes a few episodes to get going, to find it's legs.  When I was watching it when it was airing I kept waiting for it to get good week after week.  It's funny, watching a few episodes with commentary the writing / directing team totally acknowledges that they didn't know what they were doing with the show early on either.  But.... once this show found its direction, I'd say around the 5th or 6th episode it became one of the best shows (maybe the best comedy) on TV.  I absolutely love it, I can also go back to the early episodes that I thought were no good and see good in them.  Totally worth checking out if you haven't seen it.  The writing is clever and witty, the actors are all amazing and the plots are hilarious and hilariously bad (on purpose).
B0043A0PXU|5.0|This review is a rehashed comment I'd left previously for a droning \\"fan\\".  Lennox strikes a vital nerve by bringing the listener home regarding the true miracle of Jesus's birth. After listening to \\"Santa Baby\\" and \\"Christmas Time in California\\" at my job non-stop since Thanksgiving, I'm thrilled to have a CD which completes Christmas and makes it beautiful again.  For the brainless that say Lennox is \\"angry\\" - just keep up to speed with your copy of \\"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\\" and all is well.    Don't ever change Annie - your true fans totally get it!
B0035V35PI|4.0|Make no mistakes, this movie is bloody.  Packed with Matrix-style martial arts and ninja stars flying everywhere, this is the ninja movie.  Far from the almost seemingly campy Sho Kosugi movies of the 80's.  \\"Ninja assassin\\" brings forth characters that are larger than life.  I enjoyed Rain in this movie and did not find out until much later that he's actually a pop star in Asia.  You would never know it.  The story is good but the acting is somewhat mediocre in parts.  However, if you're looking to a ninja action movie for great acting, you need to get your priorities straight.  All in all, I enjoyed this film and I'm sure you will too
B00004WLXZ|5.0|The film begins with two sombre screens covered with gothic script:  \\" 20 years ago Germany was defeated in the Great War... 20 months ago, new Hope arose!\\" The camera then focuses on the single wing airplane gliding above the clouds,  over medieval cathedrals, castles and houses of Nuremberg. There is the implication of the triumphant meeting between History and Today (i.e., 1934). And then  Hitler disembarks amidst solemn ceremony and pomp, surrounded by assorted rascals, thugs and hangers on.<br /><br />This is a fascinating film which should be required reading for every film student. Masterful use of sound, special effects, editing and especially, a new application of modern media to harness the propaganda power of symbol and myth. There is nothing intellectual about intricately choreographed Nazi ceremonies, the nightly torch-lit saturnalia, siegheiling and endless marches. Riefenstahl is interested in tribal stuff encompassing the relationship between individual and the collective mind.  The camera zooms in from  pseudo-Roman battle standards and goose-stepping SS/SA legions to individual faces that seem to glow with joy & ecstasy. The  message to young German men and women is not subtle: uniforms and war games are cool. Who wouldn't want to prance about with a flashy uniform and a sword? Who wouldn;t want to make babies with those soldiers?  You can see it in women's eyes. i wondered how many of those bright-eyed men and women were still alive 10 years later. Probably not that many.<br /><br />Riefenstahl shows us a wannabe-Wagnerian Germany rising like a phoenix from the ashes of Versailles, a disastrous treaty in which Germany lost thirteen per cent of its land; six million Germans found themselves citizens of other nations and  German Army was forbidden from having tanks, warplanes or heavy artillery; Germany was indefinitely forbidden from joining the League of Nations. The Germans believed, with some justification, that the punitive measures and confiscations were instigated by Clemenceau together with powerful and strongly anti-German zionist circles which sought to defend their interests around the Balfour Declaration. The excessive sanctions caused much anger in Germany which eventually became focused and channeled by one madman into another cataclysm.  \\"The future... belongs to us\\", screams Hitler in the film. The man, filled with rage and resentment also displays the confidence and hypnotic clarity of a narcissist, together with an intriguing inner emptiness that to me reflects the absence of a human soul.  Unlike his sidekicks many of whom read from prepared notes, Hitler seemed to always know what he wanted to say: subjugate your personal will to that of the Party and the Nation, \\"unsere Deutsches Nation\\". His smirks reminded me of a kid who pulled off a prank, or a bad actor. The thugs around him  - Streicher, Goebbels, Goering, Hess, Himmler - were actors as well yet unlike the boss, these guys squeaked their \\"Heils\\", sweated  and tried hard to seem hard.<br /><br /> The film works through visual effects, catchy military tunes, manufacturing and fanning of national pride. There is little spoken commentary/narrative apart from Hitler's speeches and a few sycophantic phrases from Goebbels et al.. The banality of the pomp, the banality of the evil underlying it is what is scary, as is the ease with which a civilized people threw away individuality and intellect.<br /><br /> Riefenstahl is widely considered as one of the greatest female filmmakers of the 20th century. This phenomenally conceived and executed film received the 1935 gold medal at the Venice film festival and the gold medal at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937 but also cost her her career. As far as I am concerned,  her most impactful and courageous work was performed years later  in the Nuba mountains, in which she bravely documented the plight of the Nuba people against  the genocidal onslaught of Janjaweed-alikes and the Sudanese army.ations were instigated by Clemenceau together with powerful and strongly anti-German zionist circles which sought to defend their interests around the Balfour Declaration.

B0040JHXTI|5.0|I won't repeat the two featured reviews, which are quite insightful. It is such a thrill to get an official video from the Darkness tour that one has to overlook the modest quality of the Houston video and audio - it really is like a bootleg compared to all the other videos that Bruce has released.  The sound is compressed and the low end collapses into a thick lump whenever the full band is playing. In Thunder Road, it sounds like Max is having a pillow fight instead of hitting a drum.  It's not Max's fault, the mix just submerges the bass and drums under the vocal, guitars and keyboard. The glockenspiel is more prominent than the bass and drums in the mix in several songs. So in that respect the Houston disc really is more like a bootleg than a modern Blu Ray or DVD. In contrast, the Phoenix cuts - 5 songs on the disc that has the 2009 performance of Darkness and numerous \\"home movies\\" from the Darkness recording - were filmed for the purpose of being released and thus have very high quality sound and video. They are certainly not a throw in.     Back to Houston - what a set list! That was the tour when the E Street band went from clubs and small halls to arena sellouts.  Theretofore, Bruce had done shows of 15 or so songs.  On this tour he simply added most of the Darkness songs to the old material and expanded the shows to 3 hours in length.  I was fortunate to catch 5 shows in that tour and it has been thoroughly bootlegged.  In the autumn of 78, the band hit a stretch in which they had some of their most renowned performances, from the 29th birthday shows in later September at the Passaic Theater to Winterland on December 15th.  The Houston show falls in the middle of that great run and is a fantastic document for us fans to have. In addition to the Darkness and Born to Run songs, you get Fire, Because the Night, a couple of the songs that show up on The River (Independence Day and Ties That Bind) and most noteworthy, The Fever and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  The band is cooking and at the top of its game and what a treat so see (a) a full concert intact and (b) the young Bruce and his band with their skinny stomachs and tight skin!     The effort that went into this product is extremely impressive. Bornin time's review covers it all and I won't repeat it. Yes it is expensive but it provides dozens of hours of material.  Plus the remaster, you get a good documentary; tons of paper and video work in process including dozens of pages of Bruce's notes and draft lyrics; and then 4 full discs of unreleased performances, I think you'll agree the price is pretty normal. If you are a fan, this is worth the money.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|I almost did not buy this cd. I saw it while I was shopping at amazon.com one day, Oct 30th,read some reviews and listened to a sample of each track and said WHAT! Ozzy what have you done? Have you joined the heavy metal screamers that cannot sing? I went back and watched the 'scream' video and re-read reviews.I have been a Ozzy ( BLACK SABBATH )fan for 40 years and you have to take the bad with the good.Got the cd from amazon in a couple days.I forgot that you cannot play Ozzy cds at full volume at first but on low volume and pick up bits and pieces until you get into the Ozzy Zone. After playing over and over etc,all i can say is this cd ROCK'S! Ozzy sings his heart out about life and getting older ( aren't we all glad he did ) like 'Time Won't Wait' and 'Time' are worth the price of admission. This is not 'Black Rain 2',it is better and his new band is great with fresh riffs and young energy. No offence,but Zack has been there for almost 25 years,time for a change. I think we will see more songs and sooner with his NEW band.
1441866868|3.0|From the start of the book I was entranced by the dystopic world the author had created.  It had such great potential but then it gradually lost its lustre, and I almost put the book down halfway through, wondering why the windup girl wasn't as central a character as you would expect her to be given the book is titled after her.  I expected lots more philosophical opportunities of personal rights and morals of humans vs windups, particularly given the early rape scene which was so cavalierly legitimate and expected in that world.  I didn't put the book down, and it did pick up again for the last third, which made me grateful I keep reading, though I found the ending a bit weak and lacking in storytelling power.
0525951652|5.0|When this book arrived I thought i'd never get through it and would loose interest before I finished. however since I started i can't put it down. It is very interesting following the lives of the different families involved over the 4different countries.  I also find amazon very effiecant to deal with.
B0036EH3UC|4.0|I'll keep this short and to the point. This set includes the the pilot miniseries, all four regular television seasons, the long version of Razor, The Plan, and most of the webisodes. It is missing the \\"Face of the Enemy\\" webisodes. That's the only missing story material I've (not) found so far, and I really had to look, because the slimline case inserts don't have complete catalogs of the disc contents, and the box descriptions aren't entirely trustworthy (one promises an extended edition of \\"Islanded in a Stream of Sars [sic].\\" Perhaps this is a followup to The Woman King in which the Sagittarons get yet another respiratory disease). The Plan was unfortunately packed in Season 4.0, Disc 4's case, with no notice of this on the packaging at all. It will, of course, spoil you terribly if you watch it at this point in the series. This is what I suggest:    Acquire the \\"Face of the Enemy\\" episodes through whatever means available to you. (I am sending my duplicate to seduce Ronald D. Moore and access the NBC Universal video mainframe.) Once you have done this, burn them to a disc, and do some disc-shuffling. Put Season 4.0 Disc 4 in a case by itself, and use the double case to pair your new Face of the Enemy disc with Season 4.5 Disc 1 or 2 (it takes place between these discs). Put The Plan in its own slimline case and stick that in the big box after Season 4. There's just enough room to do this; in fact, it's pretty obvious that's what the manufacturers intended before they rushed their product out the door. You can probably find a fan-produced insert to make this case match the others, or make your own if you're feeling creative. Then you will have a complete, if partly fan produced, edition of Battlestar Galactica.    Bonus material junkies will find a wealth of commentaries, podcasts, deleted scenes, promotional material, and retrospective material. I have only seen the smallest fraction of these features, but they were pretty enjoyable as far as these things go. The bonus materials produced for the miniseries are not included; you must purchase the miniseries separately if you wish to see these.    The series gets an A. The DVD set production gets a B for incomplete disc descriptions on the case inserts, missing material, and a spoilerific epilogue movie inserted in the middle of the final season. If this were a lesser series I wouldn't mind so much, but when you're so close to perfection every blemish stands out in stark relief.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|... for a publicity stunt. This is a decent \\"cop novel\\" with all the expected elements - well thought out plot, good atmosphere, interesting main characters (both \\"good guys\\" and villains), cartoonish support cast, about right amount of humor... It is neither Chandler nor P.D.James, but whoever wrote this know their craft, and produced an entertaining (although not particularly thought provoking by any stretch of imagination)quick read. Warning to the TV show fans: dynamics of the cop vs. writer relationship is a bit different, and delightful characters of writer's family do not appear.
B003WTE886|5.0|I loved Fearless. Although, 2 or 3 of the songs on Fearless just lacked the catchiness and/or country twang, bringing the album down a little bit. It's the same way with Speak Now. Most of the songs are AMAZING. but a couple of the songs are kinda boring (sparks fly and the story of us.? but once you hit skip on those the album is AWESOME!!! Fearless had great love songs, but the heartbreak songs were monotonous, Speak Now is almost the opposite. The heartbreak songs are AMAZING!!!!! There are very few love songs on this album (just Mine, sparks fly-if you buy the deluxe, Ours is on it) The only really catchy love song is Ours from the deluxe cd. ****BOTTOM LINE: definately buy, if you're into songs about heartbreak. They're AMAZING.***
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This is my umpteenth hundred book from amazon, but my first review. This book was fantastic. It really gets you into the mind of this boy, Jack. In a way like not even the best autobiography, you ARE Jack. Through his ambiguous understanding of the outside  world, you realize as a reader (with outside world experiences) what the plot is about quite soon into the book. And, that's when this book hooks you in like no other I've read. There is a part in particular that will hook you so tight, you'll lock yourself away to find out what happens.    Believe me, I'm purposefully being vague because the part that hooks you is the emotional realization of what's happening to this boy and I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone.
B00005JSGK|5.0|This is one of the Duke's BEST movies ever!  I recieved the DVD one week to the day after ordering it and it arriaved in perfect condition!  I would do business with this company if I find they have something I'm looking for.  Thanks and keep up the good work.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|While the songs are short, they do the job well.  Twenty-two tracks of enticing rhythms and beats that keep your mind at a higher level.  Listening to this soundtrack after seeing the movie you will connect to the server and be able to see the story through sound.  Definitely a great soundtrack that runs like a story down the line and keeps you satisfied  until the finale.<br />Daft Punk has given new life to a saga that now begins anew.
B000F4MLZ8|4.0|I bought this CD after having purchased \\"Simple Times\\" and \\"The Rock and The Tide.\\" Although this CD isn't my favorite of the three, it is still true to his style (especially since it is his first CD).
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Got this as a Christmas gift and was impressed at first listen and it has grown on me since.  It is nice to see that some groups can still put together a whole album.  If I had to pick a genre, I'd have to go with alt-folk.  Little Lion Man, White Blank Page, and Thistle & Weeds are the standouts, but all 12 tracks will stay on the i-touch.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I have fallen in love with this movie and wanted to own it.  I have been buying used DVD's lately with great success, except for this one.  Other than the glitch where the movie froze, right before the love scene, it was great.  I couldn't get it passed the freeze.  I had to go to the beginning and punch up the scene just passed it.  Disappointing.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Its a good cd and I recieved it in less than a week after I ordered it!Got it really fast!
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|This book was one of m favorite books of all time...<br />Although I beleive that the first was much better, I couldn't imagine Maggie writing it any differently...<br />Right now the only con I can think of is that she write a sequal and FAST!

B003XQRZ7E|5.0|Great new cd by the supergroup! Hughes voice is still awesome, Bonhams drums rip like Bonzo, and Bonamassa's guitar shreds on this cd! Buy this now, you will not be disappointed!
B002LE8D2K|5.0|This is good quality RAM.  It you are gaming and have a Intel Core i processor, this is for you.  Check your MOBO's specs first though for compatibility.
B00005R2M3|4.0|For it being her debut english album it is great.  Although her albums since have been better, this is a must for any Shakira fan.
B003Y8YXH6|4.0|So far I have only listened to the stripped down CD (there are two of them); and I have found myself listening to them over and over again. You could say the effect is like looking out a window that you have looked before but somebody has cleaned the glass, I would take it a step further and say not only are you looking out a newly cleaned window, but you have bought new glasses for the first time in years.    John and Yoko's voices really pop on the stripped down side; I am not normally a Yoko fan but I actually found myself enjoying her songs as well as those of John's. Well worth it.
B000024E9H|4.0|This is the very first Genesis album I ever heard, borrowed from an older friend when I was 16.  I was completely blown away.  And I still feel this is the most amazing music I've ever heard.  Especially the first song, \\"The Musical Box\\" - very, very heavy and mind blowing music.  Not just tepid heavy metal, but intricate classical styling, with both quiet \\"sensitive\\" classical parts, plus heavy, heavy parts where you crank it and totally scare the neighbours.  SEARING guitar with really cool unique sounds.  Heavy, heavy keyboards.  Heavy pounding, yet intricate drums.  I will always go to my grave thinking Musical Box is almost the best song I've ever heard.      The rest of the album is not a \\"must\\" buy, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  If all the songs were as good as \\"Musical Box\\", it would be a 6 out of 5 stars.  Other people might say \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" is a more \\"quality\\" or \\"mature\\" album, but it doesn't really rock like this one does.      But the rest of the album is really good, too.  3 or 4 long, heavy songs, and 2 or 3 quiet delicate harpsichord-ish songs. The heavy songs don't just have plodding heavy metal, but intricate classical styling, with both quiet \\"sensitive\\" classical parts, plus heavy, heavy parts where you crank it and totally scare the neighbours.  SEARING guitar with really cool unique sounds.  Heavy, heavy keyboards.  Heavy pounding, yet intricate drums.     Better than their next album \\"Foxtrot\\", and better, of course, than their previous album \\"Trespass\\".  If you are interested in their first 5 years, 1969-1973, the best 2 albums to buy are this one (\\"Nursery Cryme\\") and also \\"Selling England by the Pound\\".  \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" is a bit more mellow, with a more polished sound.  This one, \\"Nursery Cryme\\", is more \\"rocky\\" and heavy, though with many quiet, sensitive passages and songs (like \\"For Absent Friends\\" and \\"Harlequin\\").  The quiet passages really make the heavy passages seem much cooler and very intense...someone else mentioned the longer songs are like stories.  Yes, and there is lots of drama musically (as well as in the lyrics of course).      If you are a person who likes classical rock fusion music, \\"art rock\\", or \\"progressive rock\\", from bands such as \\"Emerson, Lake, and Palmer\\", \\"Yes\\", or early \\"King Crimson\\", you should definitely give this early Genesis music a try.  When Peter Gabriel left in 1974, and then Steve Hackett in 1977, Genesis adopted a more poppy, mainstream sound.  Their early stuff with Gabriel and Hackett is more rock sounding, heavy, with a classical-rock fusion sound.  \\"Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time with approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide.\\" (Wikipedia)
B0015DROBO|4.0|If you are offended by the underlining sadist theme that strings the novel together, then stop reading it.  However, if you continue on, you will find two characters (Blomkvist and Salander) that are always evolving and creating conundrums that you hope will be explained or solved.  As for the writing style, yes some of the writing is poor or not realistic; however, with a good editor, those areas could have easily been resolved.  Just remember that John Steinbeck's editor had to send The Grapes of Wrath back to him more times than he liked before it went to print.<br /><br />I like it for what it is, a mystery/thriller novel which in my opinion has been a much better reading than some of these \\"romance novels\\" masked as a mystery/thriller novels.<br /><br />Am I going to read the other two novels to find out how the characters of Blomkvist and Salander further evolve?  Because of my Kindle I am able to purchase the other two books for just a few dollars, thus, it's only small price to pay to find out more about the lives of Stieg Larsson's protagonist and deuteragonist.
1591843162|4.0|I think Linchpin is an interesting read - it certainly makes its points, and shares some interesting vignettes - the one complaint I have would be that it seems to hammer some points home far too much. And if I had to read \\"lizard brain\\" one more time, I'd weep.    Buy this book for the soon-to-be college grads you know.
B000SEI230|5.0|My friend first suggested this novel to me but I had my doubt. But  I read it anyway and wow... this book is really something. I highl recommend this but make sure yo have a tissue handy... it is a real tear jerker!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Yes, there are some maybe potty jokes, but this is a really cute movie with a good moral.  Love the voice of Steve Carrell as Mr. Gru and the minions are cute as well as the girls.    Couldn't think of a better Christmas gift!
0780622650|4.0|This film starts out with a similar plot to the TV series. But there are interesting time-travel dimensions and a robot who is truly evil in the beginning (programmed by Dr. Smith). It was great to see June Lockhart and Mark Goddard in cameo roles, too! Would be really interested to see if they do another sequel to this one.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Please get this movie and watch it. It's super awesome and great for anyone who likes movies in this sort of genre. A++ WOULD WATCH AGAIN, OH WAIT, THATS WHY I BOUGHT IT.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|While understanding my deep love for Bond films may have influenced this rating, I did find the blu-ray to have excellent sound and picture quality, not to mention a bevy of features that kept me watching long after the film had ended. I viewed it on a 1080p LED 46\\" Samsung tv with a Boston Acoustics 2.1 sound bar and was thoroughly impressed by the depth of sound even without a 5.1 or greater speaker setup. Bond fans will enjoy the film that restarted the franchise and everyone else will enjoy the beauty of the movie set in many exotic locations.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|Dickens is a master of creating characters that personify myriad human weakness and deficiencies. And the BBC can be relied upon to bring these characters to life on the screen. This is a captivating story on 4 discs that we played one after the other until the end. It is the best adaptation ever with beautiful production quality and amazingly good casting, acting, and directing. The love story between Amy and Arthur intermingles with the ups and downs of fortune and the gradual unraveling of mysteries that ultimately yields a satisfying and happy ending.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|If you have eyes this set is for you. It is a shame that there are some people on earth that won't get to see this masterpiece so do yourself a favor and buy it. Just do it.

In which case you still might be entertained by Sir David Attenborough's narration and wonderful background music. A++ WOULD WATCH AGAIN, OH WAIT, THATS WHY I BOUGHT IT.
B002ZG980U|2.0|Seriously, I don't get the hype about this movie.  It's not that complex.  It's just The Matrix with dreams instead of a computer program with the heist element of Ocean's 11 (12, 13, etc).  There's virtually no character development, like how instead of keeping to himself about Mal, Leo Di Caprio just blurts his heart out to a girl he just met a couple of days ago.  I didn't care about any of the characters and it's a concept that's been done to death.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|I've been skimming through the reviews, and really don't get it. The reviews rated as most helpful are primarily negative. These reviewers say \\"there is nothing new here, don't bother...\\".    My experience with this book was very different.    I've been working on my health for over 6 years now, and have made tremendous progress. I weigh what I weighed in college, I feel good and energetic every day, I'm sleeping well, I enjoy the food I eat, my posture is good, and I don't count calories or work out to lose weight. Over the last 6 years, I've read countless books and applied what I learned from each one, together with the results of my own self-experiments (starting with a glucose meter to normalize my blood sugar, with fasting levels of 83, peaks no more than 120).    When I read a new book that has one or two useful bits of information, I count my time as well spent.    Tim's book has many useful bits. If I'd had it available a few years ago, I would be much farther along today. For example, I recently found out about the problems created by high ferritin levels, and am having a series of phlebotomy treatments to get mine back to a good range. This information is available from other sources, but is far from an \\"everybody knows it\\" paradigm.    Tim has done a great job of pulling information together and making it accessible in an easy-to-use, easy-to-integrate-with-your-life manner. He's also added information from his own self-experiments that I haven't seen anywhere else.    From Tim's book, I got exercise ideas for how to get stronger and reduce the chance of injury without investing a lot of time, ideas for how to keep my blood glucose peaks lower, ideas for learning to run more effectively, and more. I'm still going through the book to decide how much of it I want to implement and on what schedule, and am finding it to be a great resource.    Tim's book is also fun to read. I wouldn't dream of doing some of the things he's done, but they make a good story.It would be worth the price just for the entertainment.    With regard to the negative reviews, what matters is what is new to you, and I have to believe that Tim covers so much, in an accessible way, that almost anyone will get good value from it.

B003SLE6DA|3.0|This is a very interesting book. Mr. Judt explains sixty years of european postwar in this great book. He describes all the challenges that europeans had to face, most of them enormous. He does so from his political principles that you may share or not, but gives a good explanation and analysis of those years. It's a very interesting book that I read with care. Sometimes it's quite repetitive since when describing things that affect two or more countries the same things are repeated two or three times.<br /><br />The bad thing about this book is the edition. It is awfully edited. It has a lot of sticked words (without due separation), it has footnotes that do not refer to anything (they are not hyperlinked and they don't have even the same numeration), the maps can be zoomed, but they are still very tiny to study (I suppose you can zoom them more if you use the Kindle PC version) and the photographs of the paper version are not included, though they are credited. I hope editors will enhance this digital version to use all the potencialities of kindle.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Robert Plant is one of the only rock star from the sixties who remains relevant today; rather than safely trading on nostalgia, he attempts something unique with each new album and succeeds.  \\"Band of Joy\\" is masterfully sang, played and produced for the rapidly shrinking group of adults who still buy music.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I have just finished the book and I must admit I LOVED IT. okay so i practically love all vampire books.... but what got to me was the storyline and how the author didnt make it all about vampire and human lust. she added side affects of being with a vampire. A drawback for me would be that Shana couldnt get over tne fact that she loved Roman. I feel the author emphasized too much on 'no i like you. but we can never be because im human and your vampire' and with no offfense taken to Kerrelyn Sparks but the title does not suit the story. Beside these small drawbacks. I must admit i LOVED this book. If only all the Love At Stake books shared a little about how Shana and Roman are doing.   :]
0749453893|5.0|Agree with others that this book is very well written.  Easy to understand and reads quickly, which is notable for a book on a subject that could easily be made a much more complicated and technical conversation.  Especially helpful are the 'pledges' at the beginning of each chapter that identify questions up front that the content in the chapter will address.  Also helpful are the case examples at the end of each chapter.    From a content perspective, the book explores the main components of digital strategy, and is written in a way that is relevant to any size business, whether it be a large organization or a start-up.  Personally, as a brand manager within a larger company, this book added depth to my basic understanding of digital marketing strategy and helped me better understand how it should be integrated into overall marketing strategy and execution.    However, since the digital (and especially social media) landscape has been evolving at such a rapid pace (and since the book was written), it would be great to see updates made to some chapters within the book to make it even more relevant.    Otherwise, this is a great book for those looking for an in-depth introduction to digital marketing principles and strategy, or even for those already familiar with digital marketing in their organization who would like to better understand how what they do fits into an overall digital marketing framework.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|I really love the new format (DVD + Blu-Ray) because I can play the disc on my laptop (DVD) and TV (Blu-Ray). No need to review the movie - it's from Pixar!
B001FB55H6|4.0|this is a great movie. blu-ray really does it justice.<br />i was excited to get this movie, and even more excited when it arrived with a digital copy disc inside. the disappointment came when i tried to get the digital copy onto my ipod.<br />the \\"license\\" expires after july 2010 so if you didn't buy the blu-ray before then you won't be able to use the digital copy disc for anything other than a coaster. toss-it, it's just junk.<br /><br />the movie is great, i can watch it again and again - just don't expect that convenience of the digital copy, you'll have to make your own. :(
0307387178|5.0|As i write this, I notice 597 reviewers said \\"five stars\\".  Me, too, only because there isn't a higher rating.  I read this in one day after my senior in high school grandson said it was \\"over the top\\".  He was right.  I was a bit disturbed, though, when he said the main character \\"spoke to him on some subjects\\"  Since Alex was the guy who died in the bus, I asked for some assurance from my grandson that he didn't have a trip to Alaska booked anytime soon. I'm now adding Into the Wild onto my \\"top ten ever\\" list.  Another Krakauer book, Into Thin Air, is on that list.  Now I've got to learn when Krakauer is going to be singing books in my part of the world.  Unqualified recommendation.

0062004352|3.0|Lindsey Kelk's I HEART NEW YORK is an entertaining -- if predictable -- novel about a young woman's late blooming. Though our main character is hardly a teen, it read like a coming-of-age story; Angela's awakening to life beyond Mark, her stodgy and boring ex-fiance, and the hum-drum life they'd formed together.<br /><br />Everything in I HEART NEW YORK felt implausible to me. To say that life just happens to Angela is an understatement. At more than one point in the book, I let out this condescending chuckle, like, \\"Really, it's that simple?\\" For example, the fact that Angela has been in New York less than 24 hours before meeting Jenny, the woman who becomes her BFF and soon shares an apartment with her. It's pretty convenient that Jenny has an opening to completely take over Angela's life, rearranging her grief and anger at Mark into something bordering on productive. Oh! Oh! And how about a friend of Jenny's who can hook her up with a contact at a very popular women's magazine -- and said magazine happens to have an opening for a blogger? A dating blogger. And Angela? Angela's dating. Two dudes at once, in fact, and she's a writer, y'all. So she's perfect for the position. Of course.<br /><br />And the guys she's dating, Tyler and Alex? It's the classic bad-boy/good-guy tripe, pitting one against the other. Tyler can give her wealth and stability, lavishing her with expensive gifts, while Alex, a musician, has the hot emo skinny-jeans thing going on. Despite all her back-and-forth about what to do, it was obvious who she was going to pick -- and I didn't blame her. What I did find fault with was the fact that both men apparently knew about Angela's dating blog and didn't care. I mean, girlfriend was writing a blog -- about them, their dates, hinting at their sex life -- and neither of them seemed concerned. Um, what?<br /><br />But, to my surprise -- you know? I liked it. Kelk's writing was funny and endearing; Angela, for all her ridiculousness, was a character I enjoyed reading about and rooted for. Even though her life became just so picture-perfect and awesome, I didn't begrudge her that. Lord knows our girl went through some tough times to get there. The book flowed seamlessly and featured realistic dialogue -- even with the unrealistic plot twists.<br /><br />Also, New York really functioned as another character in the novel. Seeing the city through Angela's eyes was a treat, especially as she grew used to American customs and the Big Apple's cultural landmarks. She fell in love with New York just as she was learning to love herself, and that was an important lesson. By the final page, I did feel as though Angela had undergone a great change -- an instrumental part of me enjoying any book.<br /><br />This book was pure candy for me: sweet, non-filling, enjoyable. I turned each page and was wildly entertained by Angela's misadventures, which equaled a pretty fun romp to me. Lovers of chick lit and British women's fiction will likely enjoy our heroine's story -- as long as they can suspend disbelief for about 300 pages.and rooted for.

B003HYNB34|5.0|Being a life long fan of the Doctor, I have can say the newest Doctor really had me questioning the path this character was taking. It wasn't until the season finale that I felt he truly captured the essence of the Doctor. Granted many of the previous persona's he had were more fluid in their conversions, I really feel that the initiation of this new form really clarified for those unsure of what it is like to get a new body for the Doctor. In previous series, it was hinted at but not quite as clear but this series really gave shape to the challenges the Doctor faces when his form changes.<br /><br />I also think this new perspective of the Doctor with a more dark and less empathetic for the human kind has become more like the Master was in the earlier series so I wonder where they are going with this approach. I wonder where we will go next. But you can be sure, I will be right along with him as he goes through these challenges and changes.
B001NXBRJG|4.0|Action, latex and a philosophy lesson all at the same time.  What more could you ask for?  Borrowing ideas from Gnostic and Hellenistic Philosophy, the Wachowski brothers create a tale that will have you pondering your own existence long after the credits have rolled.  This movie is intense.  So intense in fact that it was written ten years before it's release but was put on hold due to the technology needed to produce the film was not created yet.  There are three parts to the Trilogy including Matrix, Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions.  All three were planned before the filming began for the first one and it shows.  Each film is strong in it's own right but together they flow continuously following the adventures of Neo (Keanu Reeves).  What Reeves lacks in emotion and acting quality, Lawrence Fishburne and Carrie-Ann Moss save him, making the film terrific.  Go ahead, take the Red pill.  I would not recommend the anniversary edition as it is somewhat of a letdown unless you're a huge fan of the movie.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|This album is very dreamy and emotional. When I first listened to it I thought that the first portion of the album was better than the second half but upon subsequent listens I found that the entire record is great. The song writing, the musicianship and the vocals for me is a perfect ten. I like to stay away from reviews until after I've listened to the record myself because I find that it's never good to approach anything with expectations in mind so I think that you should do the same, ignore all of these reviews and just give this album a listen.

B0042MEQVG|3.0|The service for this product was great, how ever this movie wasn't as big as every one claims it to be. I think its more of the women that love this movie because its based on a love story in general with abe rippign guys and sensative people where a lot of women are deprived. There are some guys like that, if you look at the right place. This movie was too much for me, the plot of it just seemed bland and basic. Love a friend dont want to tell him because I'm in love with a guy the cry and argue over the girl fight for servival and end to be continued. The movies or no where near as good as the books but overal I gave this three stars good attempt, a little bland cool acting and nice screen play and graphical work

0765326353|4.0|The greatest challenge when writing a 1000 page novel that will be the first of a decology is to keep it moving even though you are trying to lay down the setting for the entire series.  I think Sanderson did a pretty good job of achieving this goal.    To me, the very nature of great epic novels is that they pull you in deep into the characters and the world the author has created.  I was able to picture Sanderson's world clearly, and he made me feel like I know the characters.    I have read several other books by Sanderson, including the latest WOT books, and can say I will read all of his previous works.  However, the biggest problem with a series like this is that by the time each book finally comes out you have forgotten much of what happened in the original.  So, unless you are really looking to dive in to the book right now, I would recommend waiting until a few more come out.    Of course, I didn't take my own advice because I was excited about a new Sanderson book.  Maybe I'll wait for several other volumes come out before I pick up the series again....but probably not.    Come on Brandon...when's the next one.

There are many books in the Harry Bosch series.
0439023513|1.0|Spoilers      As other reviewers have stated, this book is completely different from the previous two. They balanced the darkness and the light in humanity very well. One was never left bereft and hopeless. This book, however, has no balance.     Katniss spends most of the book sedated, hospitalized, and suffering severe PTSD. Peeta is tortured and brainwashed into wanting to kill her. Gale spends his time developing anti-civilian weapons. The leader of District 13 is at least as evil as President Snow.    The only major counterbalance to all this horror and misery would be Prim. Her death was so gratuitously pointless that it sums up the entire book. Good people lose, evil people win, nothing ever really changes.    Wow. Way to ruin a great series. I am off to look for a little sunshine and hope now.
B001QKSWOE|1.0|I usually enjoy the Stephanie Plum books but this one is a big exception.   The plot is practically non-existant - the bad guys are so devoid of any character that you don't care whether they are caught or not.  The other non-recurring characters are just plain ridiculous - Easter Bunny, Sasquatch, Jersey Devil, and most of all the Fire Farter - which is the most stupid, ridiculous thing I have ever read in a book.   So Janet Evanovich,  Either shape up or give up altogether - many more books like this and you will be out of a job.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I no longer think of Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy! He is now George VI. He gives a wonderful performance in this movie and has become a really fine actor. Every actor in this film is first rate. (Mr. Collins and Elizabeth Bennett also appear, for you Jane Austin fans) I'm buying it as soon as it's available because to appreciate ALL the performances one will have to watch it repeatedly. The sound track was also very good.  Please see other reviews if you want the story line. Better yet just go!

I had a dvd copy of this film and compared the two and it looks outstanding on blu-ray. The movie was filmed with all kinds of cameras so people might get confused by the look and say it does not look so great on blu-ray but thats not true. The film is a classic. If you have not seen this in a while def buy it, you will reconnect all over again. Also the audio is outstanding on blu-ray. 10 out of 10.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I can think of one and only one major flaw in this documentary: It ends too quickly.     The filmmakers unearthed stunning footage from the early '70s -- Rush playing small gigs before they were signed, Neil Peart's previous band in action, even a family argument in which Alex tells his family he's leaving school to pursue music.     The band is remarkably candid about several issues in band history. Alex and Geddy agree that they disagreed over the role of keyboards in their late-80s output. The famously reclusive Neil opens up about his reluctance to greet fans and, to my great surprise, about how he coped with the family tragedies that put the band on hiatus.    Add the interviews with fellow musicians, and we're left with a clear picture of how Rush influenced music and how they went about the business of doing it.    The film never lags. It's never repetitive. I'd agree with other reviewers that even those who don't like the band but enjoy the creative process would find the film interesting, funny in many places and sometimes touching.    Hard-core Rush fans may complain about a favorite topic left unexplored. I was surprised that the filmmakers didn't mention Geddy and Alex's solo projects. Some of the changes in producers and record labels are omitted or mentioned only in passing as the film rushes (pardon the pun) through several albums of the 90s and 2000s. They never explain all the goofy stuff on stage with the band -- dolls? Washing machines? What is all that?    But this film could've been five hours long and still left someone's pet question unanswered. What we have here is stunning in its own right, and it doesn't gloss over whole periods of band history (cough cough ... Behind the Music ... cough ... Fleetwood Mac ...). I had high expectations for this film, and it met them. Fans will not be disappointed.

On another note I would give the story itself 4 Stars, meaning I hope they make another one but I save 5 stars for very few movies.

Suzanne Collins has written a phenomically dramtic climax to an amazing series that will have you not only on the edge of your seat, but falling off of it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is a great series. Havent been able to catch up with the newest episodes but hoping I can soon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a book that has not been topped in unpredictiblity. Suzanne Collins has written a novel that has you gasping for breath when you reach the last page. It makes you demand retribubation. My favorite book in the trilogy, it explains a lot of the questions that I had after reading The Hunger Games.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Love the movie but think its stupid to continuously keep re-releasing the movie to make even more money. Dont they think the movie has made enough money already. Anyway I only re-bought the movie because I just recently got into blu ray just before this release and gave my dvd copy to someone as a gift.
B00006JIA4|2.0|My set was delivered yesterday.  I opened it up this morning only to find that Disk 1 is missing, hence the 2 star rating.  My set was wrapped in soft plastic unlike most new CD's which come wrapped in the stiffer clear plastic you have to cut open.  The plastic wrapper also had a sticker on it labeled \\"as seen on TV\\".  Go figure.  I'm sure Amazon will make this right via exchange, but it's a hassle.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a &#34;must read&#34; for all sci fi fans as well as a great intro to the genre for all others.
B001UHOWXI|4.0|Although it is in Blu-Ray... it is still not Blu-Ray quality because it is old. But they did a great job of cleaning up the video. Fantastic! But the audio is still mono. I watched the colorized version but it is in the 4:3 format so I will not give it five stars because of that. Other wise this is fantastic. But 4:3 stinks.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Create printing. They jump out at you more than ever and you will jump more than ever also.  Makes a great movie even better at home.
B000002UWP|5.0|Why beat around the bush here?  From start to finish, this album is fantastic.  Who knew pop could be so much fun, so filled with emotion, so filled with passion?  And here's another little nugget of info you might find interesting -- I actually owned this CD for more than TEN YEARS before I realized what a gem it is.  And as you may have suspected, the reason for the initial purchase was for the two popular hits it contained -- \\"Joyride\\" and \\"Church of Your Heart.\\"  But like I said, if you limit yourself to only those tracks, you'll definitely be missing out on something wonderful.  This album is filled with a wide variety of imaginative, catchy, and carefully sculpted songs, ranging from thumping, jubilant rock to tear-inducing, heart-breaking ballads.  The vocals soar, the instrumentation is tight and precise.  Don't make the same mistake I did by taking so long to discover this CD.  I am going to consider purchasing more Roxette material in the future -- if the rest is as good as this, it will be a wise investment.
6305127646|5.0|It really is a great movie.  I already watched it in the theaters when it first came out and then on DVD a bunch of times.  Now, I could watch it on BlockBuster streaming or over and over again on my DVD and I never get sick of it.  I'm surprisecd there's so many people that still didn't see it... but, that's okay.  At least it gives me an opportunity to watch it again with those people that have never seen it.  I've seen it 20+ times and I would still watch it again.  A++ guys!  Good job!    BTW... great price on Amazon!!!
0061733199|5.0|I have been reading this book for a while now and I will have to say it is a great book. Even if you do not want to sit down and take the time to read the entire book it makes a great reference guide with everything you will need to know about survival in many different situations.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I received the DVD set for Christmas and am simply in love with it. Any issues with the packaging have been corrected. It includes the asides, Razor and The Resistance (Unfortunately, due to the writer's strike of '08, the Face of the Enemy webisodes are not on the DVD, and most likely never will be.)  And, I don't know if the set has been updated since most of these reviews were written or not, but the set I received INCLUDES \\"The Plan\\" direct to DVD movie. Inside of the boxed set, it's in the case with Season 4.0 Disc 4. I was putting in Disc 4 of Season 4.0, looked over and HEY! There's \\"The Plan\\" next to it! Certainly a nice surprise, in addition to a brilliant series.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I bought this cd because i loved his singles on the radio. To my suprise, the whole cd was just as good. I was worried that it would be one of those cds where the only good songs were on the radio but I quickly fell in love with the whole cd. This is worth every penny and I still can't stop listening to it. One of the best cds out there right now.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|we got this as a gift from our son about 5 years ago.  I bet we have watched it 20 times.  it is so good. we enjoy it everytime we watch it.  so, this year I bought it as a gift for my brother.  he has not watched it yet, but I know he will enjoy it.
B0042816YK|4.0|Nope, I didn't read the book. I have three copies, all given to me by friends who loved it and I just didn't get around to reading it.  Having read many of the reviews here, I had no interest in seeing this movie at all. I was not too happy on Christmas day when I was with friends, and everyone wanted to see this movie.  I reluctantly agreed to watch, and was pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoyed it.  Visually it was beautiful. I found some of it touching, some of it a little trite, and some of it amusing. The characters were ordinary, likable, and mostly believable,  I actually identified with her search, and her commitment difficulties.  I traveled like this for many of the same reasons when I was younger... I spent time at an ashram in India, spent some time in Bangkok, some time in Rome, some time in London and Paris.  I had wonderful experiences, and a lot of fun. Did I solve all of the mysteries of life, settle all of my issues... No. But I learned a lot and grew as a human being. As, I think, she did.  I was satisfied and entertained. Given that I thought this was going to be the worst movie of all time, I was really delighted.  In fact, I just ordered a copy for myself, because I want to see it again... and will probably watch it a third time at some point.
086719720X|4.0|The art collected inside the pages of \\"Fushigi Circus\\" is some of my favorite Mark Ryden work to date.  And while each piece is amazingly unique and surreal in the way that Ryden's work always is, several of the previous reviewers are entirely correct: this book is tiny!  Tiny, tiny, tiny.  It is hard to appreciate an intricate piece of artwork when it has been reduced down to such a miniscule size.  I would not trade my copy for the world; it is, afterall, still Mark Ryden and I find his work genius and inspiring.  However, I would have gladly paid the extra money to have the book in a sufficient size so that the detail of the work can truly shine through.
B000TRSAAG|4.0|Dexter Gordon was at one of his peaks with his Blue Note sessions of the early 60s that included such awesome accompanists as Sonny Clark, Butch Warren and Billy Higgins (Go, A Swingin' Affair), Kenny Drew, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones (Dexter Calling) and Horace Parlan, George Tucker, and Al Harewood (Doin' Alright).  When he landed in Europe in 1963, he hooked up with a trio composed of Bud Powell (p), Pierre Michelot (b), and Kenny Clarke (d).  That trio was a cohesive unit that recorded some excellent music, as the two trio tracks show.  One bright spot is Bud Powell, well into his final decline, sounding better than he had in some years.  The transition from playing as a piano-based trio to accompanying Dexter with his dynamic, galloping, uptempo style was not a smooth one.  The rhythm section seems out of the groove and not quite swinging in trying to keep up with Dexter.  A lot of Clarke's accents seem like random crashing around that doesn't really build the musical dynamics.  The quartet session did produce two ballad tracks that are in my opinion among Dexter's best ever:  Willow Weep for Me and Stairway to the Stars.  Stairway in particular reaches rare emotional heights.  Dexter also lays down an awesome, push-the-edge, Coltrane-ish solo in A Night in Tunisia and the rhythmic flaws seem less distracting than on the other uptempo tracks.      In summary, there are some excellent tracks and some deeply flawed ones on this album.  I find the overall listening experience less satisfying than with Dexter's other albums of the same era.  But if you already have his other early-to-mid 60s Blue Note albums, there are enough gems to make it worthwhile.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Wow. What a fantastic movie. This movie is wonderful and insightful. It challenges you to think about how hard it is to defy your own nature. This movie is about Mr. Fox, who as you might have guessed... is Fantastic, back in the day he was the best chicken thief around, until his wife tells him to quit. After this he starts to write a column in the local newspaper for a living, but that life just isn't enough. Mr. Fox struggles to maintain his current life for his wife, while fending off his true nature... the inner animal you could say. This movie follows his struggles and eventually, how he decides to live his life. Some people may be discouraged from this movie because they are \\"puppets\\" but you hardly even notice. This film is one of my favorites, and it's Wes Anderson so you know it has to be good!
0439023513|1.0|Once again, I strongly caution parents to read these books first before thrusting the series at your unsuspecting children. The violence is abundant, graphic, and mindless (this is a war, after all.) Most children in the \\"young adult\\" category to whom this is marketed may not understand the dystopian society in which these books take place. They also might be too young to be as heartbroken by the rampant needless violence as they should be.<br /><br />Words cannot express how much I disliked these books, but I'll give it my best shot.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is the single most despicable protagonist I've ever been expected to root for. She's selfish, foolish, demanding, an incessant whiner, and not very bright.<br /><br />I'll try to explain what I mean without spoiling too many things:<br /><br />Her selfishness knows no bounds, and not just with the yawn-worthy \\"can't I have both?\\" love triangle featuring Gale and Peeta that continues until the conclusion of this book. She also threatens suicide yet again when she doesn't get her way. Suicide is NOT a bargaining chip! Katniss is immature and has no concept of the show of strength known as compromise, so when she doesn't get her way she throws a tantrum and threatens to kill herself. What's worse is she does it more than once. This really disgusted me.<br /><br />Her foolishness is featured in nearly every chapter. If you manage to make it through the second book and into the third, I won't have to explain this one to you at all.<br /><br />Demanding? Absolutely. You're a player in a game, Katniss. Just because they put your picture on the box doesn't mean you get to dictate how the game is played. This thing - this revolution - is far, far bigger than you and your petty concerns.<br /><br />Why did I say she's not very bright? In the first book it was glaring from every page how frustratingly thick she was, from \\"what did it mean when he...\\" to \\"I couldn't figure out what that meant.\\" I couldn't believe guys were fighting over her!<br /><br />The whining goes back to the demanding attitude of hers. If you're astute enough, you'll pick up on everything that is wrong with elevating the despicable Katniss as a hero. She would have made a much better martyr, and preferably before we got to know her as well as we did.<br /><br />I really can't respect a \\"heroine\\" this immature; she spends a good portion of this book napping in supply closets to avoid responsibilities or slipping into a drug-induced haze to keep from dealing with difficult situations. (I don't know of any drug that makes my real-world problems go away, nor have I ever been able to run away from something that must be dealt with.) Heroines are meant to be admired. The Katniss I saw was utterly unworthy of respect or admiration. The Girl Who Was on Fire flickers weakly throughout this book, but unfortunately does not get snuffed.<br /><br />I did NOT expect a perfect ending, and I couldn't care less about the Peeta or Gale debate (in my opinion she didn't deserve either of them) but I did not expect to be so absolutely put off by these books. I couldn't wait to be done with them, and I don't recommend them to anyone.
0061703257|5.0|In the summer of 1954, US Marshal Teddy Daniels travels to Shutter Island, home of the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  Together with his partner, Chuck Aule, Teddy sets out to find an escaped psychotic patient named Rachel Solando.  Apparently, Rachel Solando has managed to escape from a locked cell, walk past a group of orderlies and get past two guarded checkpoints.  Given that it would be impossible for her to swim from the island to the mainland, she must be somewhere on the island.  But where is she?  Is there an answer in the cryptic coded message that she has left behind?<br /><br />The mystery in this novel is not only about Rachel Solando. Teddy Daniels was very keen to accept this particular assignment and despite his fear of water - which made the ferry trip a nightmare for him - has his own reasons for wanting to be on Shutter Island.  His wife's murderer is on the island as well, and he is keen to find him.  Teddy Daniels is also curious about what goes on at Shutter Island: there are three wards housed in separate buildings and an apparently empty lighthouse is surrounded by an electrified fence and armed guards.  Why?<br /><br />When Chuck Aule disappears, it  seems to confirm that Teddy Daniels's own life is also in jeopardy.  But why?  And why are the doctors not completely co-operating with the investigation?  What is the truth about Shutter Island?<br /><br />The hurricane that sweeps over Shutter Island provides the perfect backdrop to the story. And the ending?  It took me by surprise, and then it made its own form of perfect sense.  Maybe.<br /><br />`They're creating ghosts here, Marshal.  Ghosts to go out into the world and do ghostly work.'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B001DHXT1G|4.0|This was one of the first movies I saw on Blu Ray.  I had the movie on DVD at the time and for comparison purposes wanted to see if there was really much of a difference.  YES.  There is.  The colors pop a lot more and The Incedible Hulk is a great movie to utilize not only the visual side of things as it pertains to a Blu Ray, but also the sound side of things.  The Incredble Hulk is one of my favorite Super Hero movies of all time and I was so pleased that the Blu Ray was solid in it's presentation of the film.  If you're on the fence about picking up this title on Blu Ray...come down...just get it...you'll be pleased.
0307272702|5.0|Gary Taubes's earlier book had a huge effect on my eating habits.  I quit eating sugar and flour.  I got curious about how different foods effect my blood sugar so I got a tester at Wal-Mart and was dismayed to find out that whole grains and beans caused my blood sugar readings to spike, just like the refined foods.      The good news was I found out there were endless things I could eat that don't raise my blood sugar at all. The result is that my blood sugar readings, which had been creeping up for years, have started creeping down back into the normal range.  I haven't lost much weight, though.  I am enjoying the new book, and though his views haven't changed, there are new slants on the same issues, and it's much more fun to read.
B003TXSF5C|3.0|Theoretical physicists have extraordinary propensity to assume they can have secret knowledge, and nobody else.  So a beautifully written book like this gives generations of thinking on the subject of being and creation, a proper survey, but fails to conclude that a \\"Grand Design\\" demands a \\"Grand Designer\\".  Perhaps this is ultimately the conclusion that will put the questions (many of them) to rest.  But, not in their lifetime.
0553805371|1.0|This book is a disappointing effort from scientists of this caliber and distinction. In some respects it is an embarrassing, foolish book.    1. The book is disappointing because it often fails as a work of popular science. For example, I have read enough popular science books to have been exposed to numerous explanations of the \\"double slit\\" experiment. This book's explanation is one of the worst I have read.     2. The book's statement on its first page that \\"philosophy is dead\\" is a foolish, ignorant statement. So, the logic goes as follows: because philosophy's traditional explanations of the physical world have been superseded by physics, all of philosophy is dead. But this obviously makes no sense. Nothing in modern physics replaces philosophical theories of ethics or political philosophy. Or, for that matter, nothing in modern physics makes superfluous the methodological discussions of the philosophy of science. In fact, much of this book is really not a work of popular physics, but rather an argument for a particular philosophical approach to theoretical physics.     3. The fact that one particular version of physics theory, for which there is not much empirical evidence, can explain how the universe might arise from a particular variety of nothing, does not really explain the origin of things. It simply pushes back the question of origins one stage. Even if this theory was proven correct, we would then be faced with the origins of a particular type of nothing subject to a particular type of physics principles. The authors are too easily satisfied with their own theory.     It would be interesting to read a book on this topic -- the origins of everything -- by physicists who might have read some philosophy, and might be open to a wider variety of theoretical explanations. It would help if those physicists also made a greater effort to provide good explanations of physics experiments and theories. The present book, however, is a failure both as philosophy andas popular science.

B000MGB6M8|5.0|Great chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Action packed! There is never a dull moment. I strongly recommend this must have movie.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|Jason Statham framed for the benefit of a televised prison massacre on wheels; more punches, explosions and gunfire than Roger Corman could ever have imagined; the evil and sadistic female prison warden who learns the meaning of karma the hard way... what's not to like? If it's unbridled mayhem and no-holds-barred prison warfare you want, this fits the bill. Short on plot, long on action... and a foregone conclusion: Statham gets both girls - the hot one and the cold one. Satisfying.

B001GCUNYO|5.0|An old story: the naive teen taken into white slavery, and Liam Neeson as the guy you should know better than to cross. Spectacular action, and Neeson plays the part of the protective father well. It's hard to believe that he manages to wade through so many bad guys without losing his life, but this is a morality play, and it turns out that hell hath no fury like a former covert operative with a bad temper, a teenage daughter and endless resources. Non-stop action and a predictable but satisfying ending.
1401922732|5.0|The Archangel Michael oracle cards are beautiful.  They also are very helpful in my daily worship.  Very powerful and very enlightening. I highly reccomend  these cards to coincide with my daily meditation and worship.
B000MGB6M8|4.0|For simple fun, you can't beat an actioner about a husband and wife trying - for most of the film, anyway - to kill each other in the most creative ways. Jolie and Pitt have real chemistry, regardless of what the tabloids might tell you, and Mr. And Mrs. Smith allows Pitt to flex his considerable comedic muscle.  This is the best civil-war-under-the-same-roof flick since The War Of The Roses; it's light, fast, funny and visually appealing - and the combatants survive both each other and one of the campiest, most over-the-top shootouts I've ever seen. Suspend disbelief, and this film is a very satisfying fun-fest.
B004EJ14V2|1.0|This has seriously been the worst movie I've seen in a very long time. The acting is atrocious, as if every person on screen has never been an actor and was suddenly told to read lines. The humor is unintelligent, as if the script was made by a Middle School child who tried to write what they thought High School was like. Just simply horrible. How anyone could like this movie seriously makes me question the quality and intelligence of the people giving these reviews.
B00445JSX2|4.0|I love the dvd. My only complaint is that they messed this dvd up when transfering over. I saw DM twice last year and i have to say ... Martin Gore's voice is too low in the mix here. I mean extremely low. Dave Gahan's is fine but they screwed Gore on this. Pretty dissapointed with this. However, for anyone who didn't catch this live show- its a must. For those that did, its a nice reminder of how amazing these guys are live.

0525951652|4.0|Typical of so many in the One Star Brigade, Olga Bezhanova fatuously intones: If you were one of those people who eagerly awaited the release of Ken Follett's Fall of Giants (The Century Trilogy), you are in for a nasty surprise.<br />Fiddlesticks!<br />Is this great literature?  No.  Is it even scintillating storytelling?  No again.  And is it a \\"surprise,\\" either \\"nasty\\" or otherwise.  No for a third, unremarkable time.<br />Please remember we're talking about the writer who gave us \\"Hammer of Eden\\" and \\"Lie Down with Lions.\\"  He is as capable of thin-as-gruel drivel as he is of spellbinding talecraft (\\"Eye of the Needle,\\" \\"Pillars of the Earth\\").  But only a naive or overly optimistic reader could expect him to deliver any more than he did in \\"Fall of Giants.\\"<br />How could this far ranging and disparate view of a riotous decade--told in fewer than a thousand pages--have been anything but what it is, a period piece soap opera on which to hang a lucid and provocative account of historic developments.<br />Where did you folks find the \\"nasty surprise\\"?  Anyone who has read Follett's \\"Man from St. Petersburg\\" knows exactly how he treats his costume drama history lessons.  They are moderately entertaining, populated by characters you can feel something for--not much, but something and not necessarily affection.  But for me, and for millions of others like me who simply abhor reading straight history, Follett is able to put age-old myths and legends into a coherent and meaningful perspective: Ferdinand and Sarajevo, the Somme, trench warfare, The League of Nations debacle, the rise of the Bolsheviks, and well, hellloooo, Hitler.  Sure, I knew bits and pieces of all these developments--much of it from better written, more tightly focused books like \\"All Quiet on the Western Front.\\"  But Follett's easy to digest, bedtime read showed real imagination in giving a human face to a complex and confusing web of inhuman events.<br />I wasn't blown away by Follett's handling of the years around World War I.  But Follett writes like Follett, not like MacKinlay Kantor, not like James Michener, not even like E. L. Doctorow.  \\"Fall of Giants\\" is certainly as good--I'd say better--a reflection on WWI as \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is on the U.S. Civil War, and it's a whole lot more enlightening.<br />When I opened the book, it was difficult not to notice the author's name on the cover.  I knew exactly what I was letting myself in for, including his fumbling, sophomoric efforts at writing sex scenes.  And I got just what I bargained for.  I look forward to the next two volumes.f the years around World War I.  But Follett writes like Follett, not like MacKinlay Kantor, not like James Michener, not even like E. L. Doctorow.  \\"Fall of Giants\\" is certainly as good--I'd say better--a reflection on WWI as \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is on the U.S. Civil War, and it's a whole lot more enlightening.<br />When I opened the book, it was difficult not to notice the author's name on the cover.

B0029LHWFO|5.0|I read this book a little over a year ago. It had a profound effect on me and even though I was always a confident person, I had a renewed resolve that I could do anything I put my heart to and overcome any kind of obstacle such as prejudice and such. It is a well written, candid, interesting book. Shortly after, I was able to pen my own first book. It gives an accurate angle on the struggles of a minority, the confusion of a bi-racial person, resilience and how to turn the negative in your life into a motivating factor. For example, the absence of his father made him a great husband a father. He touches on how there is no room for bitterness and one continually needs to press forward in life and be the best you can be, aiming for the sky. Barack Obama of course is very articulate and great with words. I will read anything he writes. It comes highly recommended.

068987474X|5.0|I read this book in 2004. Thereafter, I went on a crusade to get every single female I knew to do the same. I encouraged them to own a copy, keep it on their nightstand and read it over and over till it sticks. I have been married since 2006 and mastering the principles in this book added to the changes I made in my thinking which translated into my behavor and eventually, a successful relationship. I recommened it to all women who desire marriage but it appears to have eluded them. We know everybody is not going to get married and there aren't enough men to go around but reading this book will bump you nearer the top of the list to be picked! And when you do get in that relationship, your tendencies to self-destruct will be less, I promise you. I can't even locate my copy and might just purchase it again. Highly recommended.

B00003JRCQ|3.0|Persuasion is a slow paced movie, not for those who typically like fast-action flicks. Very little actually happens during the story, but it is rather a character-driven movie about a man and woman reforging their past love for each other; a love that never really died.<br /><br />The story begins eight years after Ann has rejected the marriage proposal of Frederick because she was advised that he was beneath her station and had no prospects. Then, during their eight-year separation, he gains a fortune on the high seas and Ann's family is near bankruptcy because of their pompous father's financial extravagance.<br /><br />Both main characters never married. Ann (played wonderfully by Amanda Root) is considered a dispirited, sad \\"old maid\\" and Frederick (played by Ciaran Hinds) is considered an eligible bachelor by all the young ladies who try their hand to win him, since he is newly returned from the Napoleonic war and ready to take a wife.<br /><br />The story is predictable, with no major surprises. It is gentile and fun, though, and I found myself intrigued toward the end, even though I nearly turned it off in the beginning because it was paced so slowly, showing people walking, horse-drawn carts and carriages, countryside and so forth. There was lots that I would have cut in order to get on with the story, but much of the pacing WAS the story. It's a different era with an emphasis on quiet conversation. People talk and talk, and they walk and talk, but the talk is often delightful in its common curtesy and politeness. Many modern young women could learn much from watching this movie.<br /><br />Let this be a possible gage: if my review seems dull, then the movie may also seem dull because this review reflects the pace of Persuasion.<br /><br />To me, it was ultimately a \\"feel good\\" movie that produced a smile.

Told by several enthralling narrators, we're allowed a glimpse into a world of cunning bravery, ruthless plots, unshakeable love, and proper etiquette.

B0042JTDXK|1.0|I have always been a HUGE fan of Josh Groban, owning most of everything he has done, but this CD I just could not even like, even a tiny bit.  I loaded it into my iTunes immediately and started to listen and I groaned.....just awful!  Any artist's attempts to push the envelope is okay with me but keep in mind not everyone might like the leap you have made.  For me it didn't measure up to his soaring, melodic, romantic voice I have been used to listening to.  So sorry I can't return it!  Okay, all you knuckle heads who want to rip me for not liking this latest production go right ahead but I stand by my opinion, which btw, I'm entitled to.  If you have not heard any of these songs then I recommend finding a way to listen to them BEFORE you spend the money to purchase.  If you like this latest by Groban then three cheers for you.  I'll stick with his older music, thank you very much.
B003UESJHE|5.0|He is about to make quite possibly one of the most important moves of his career: A speech to thousands of quiet and on-the-edge-of-the-seat people at the Wembley stadium. He stands at the podium, with the speech in hand and his lovely wife by his side. He begins to open his mouth... but the words can't come out. He fights himself to get the words out, but no matter how hard he fights, Prince Albert's- soon to be King George VI- stammer gets the best of him. His wife, Queen Elizabeth, is worried for him. So what does she do? She looks in the paper and follows an ad that leads the two to failed Australian stage actor Lionel Logue, who teaches him how to do his best in the situations where his stammer gets the best of him.<br /><br />The King's Speech is based upon this incredible story, and is really a remarkable film in every aspect. The film, unfortunately, was slapped with an R rating from the MPAA for about 12 occurrences of the F-bomb. It's too bad the MPAA don't know how to take things into context and like to automatically slap an R rating because of one four letter word, even despite the word being used in a non-sexual context. Even young children are taught the swearing trick in speech therapy.<br /><br />The performances in the film are nothing short of incredible- Colin Firth has yet again proved why he is a great actor. He apparently studied stammering to get prepared for the role and I'm not surprised- his stammering was realistic. Helena Bonham Carter gives a sexy and suave performance as Queen Elizabeth, the supportive wife and woman who's at his right hand all along. Geoffrey Rush and Guy Pearce are also incredible, Rush giving a nice and comical performance as Lionel Logue and Peace playing the brother, David.<br /><br />I will admit I was wondering how a movie about a man who stammers could be good, and I can safely say after seeing this movie, it was done in a way it could be entertaining!!!! The therapy scenes are wicked fun and hilarious. The funniest of all being where Bertie is taught the swearing trick, where you can release your stress by unleashing a whole load of cuss words. That scene had the whole theatre laughing out loud and was definitely one of the highlights of the film. However the true highlights was the big speech near the end, where King George VI is faced with the biggest task of his career- a speech on the radio. The whole scene is intense and has you on the edge of your seat- it is every bit as suspenseful as being at a soccer game in the final few minutes and hoping your team can win. I felt like I was one of the many people listening to the speech on the radio. It was effective and you will definitely be on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />In short, I walked out of the theatre with a big smile on my face. It is amazing how such a small film can have a big amount of heart, and this film, I can safely say, is aw-aw-aw-awesome, and is one that should not be missed.Bertie is taught the swearing trick, where you can release your stress by unleashing a whole load of cuss words.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful collector movie sets that I have ever purchased! The sale price of $15.49 was just as awesome! This set is beyond amazing. Such a great buy and def better than just a single DVD set! If you love Avatar, especially because of the beauty in the colorfulness of this movie, this set is just as breathtaking! It's set up more like a book. You have about 6 pages of beautiful pictures and the DVDs are set inside as a pull out insert. Just amazing!! Fav movie purchase of the year!
B003PIUC02|5.0|I heard alot about this show but could never see it cause I don't have Starz so when I got a new blu ray player this was one of the first dvd's I purchased. What a great show but now I'm bummed out that the main actor is out due to his illness. But I hear they may do a prequel season(?) Anyway this is a good show. Almost like 300 made into a series. It was worth the wait and will pick up the other seasons when they become available on blu ray.

B00005JK8K|4.0|Great movie, very realistic, and I completely disagree with the Navajos who posted negative reviews, but are factually rather superficial.  1 - I believe the movie was not focused around Nicholas Cage's character much at all, in fact, we don't know much about him and his past at all (other than he's Italian and has an Italian last name), when in fact we DO know what the navajo characters did before the call of duty.  2 - I strongly disagree that the movie should've focused on the \\"origin\\" of the code talkers, as it would have made it a much slower, far more boring movie, for the vast majority of the public. I believe when you decide to make a movie about WW2, you have to show the grim true reality of combat, for future generations to learn from. This movie (great director) shows combat scenes VERY realistically, and in my experienced -but humble- opinion, the best WW2 movies ever, are always the more realistic ones (Saving Private Ryan, Band Of Brothers, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Schindler's List).  Bottom line: there is no way that whoever watches this movie and has an IQ higher than average would intepret it as \\"the code talkers were depicted as a back-burner\\". I am a huge WW2 fan, I study everything about it, I've had family members who were deported in concentration camps, I had family members who hid jewish people from the nazis. WW2 marked my whole life. I know a thing or two about the WW2 subject, and I must say one reason I enjoyed this particular movie is because of the code talkers, what they represented, how they integrated among white men, and the fact that they had a good, honorable company sergent they respected.  Great movie.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I read all the Sookie books and loved them I couldn't put them down. I am feeling the same way with the DVDs! My hubby got me the season one set on black Friday for like $10! and we picked up the second season for $15 yesterday. So excited. We started the first season and seeing as tho it's not a kids show I only have so much time between work and all. But when I get some free time that's what I have been doing.    I love the different angels the series gives and it still basically fallows the Sookie books story. It's nice having more on the others and not just all Sookie. I highly recommend this.
B000A7X6WM|3.0|I hesitated to buy this 5.1 mix for a long time because another reviewer trashed it.  Well I LOVE surround and like Goldfrapp, some releases more than others, but what the heck lets go for it.  This won't be my first pick as to do in 5.1 from their catalog and not my favorite album of theirs either BUT I actually like the album better after listening to in surround.  If you're a fan of this album and/or a big fan of Goldfrapp you might want to pick it up if it's not expensive ( o yeah thanks to the other reviewer for a least keeping the price low for slamming it).  Not the best 5.1 mix but definitely not the worse.  C+ overall. Sound field kind of blurred but full (but that may be what they wanted) mixed heavy toward the back with very little center speaker but worth a listen if you like the title. Have fun!
0060936223|5.0|Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe were just names I knew, yet I knew nothing about who they actually are/were. (I'm 36 years old.) I have always romanticized the late 1960's and 1970's New York City, and Smith writes the story of her and Mapplethorpe's meeting as young adults all the way to (SPOILER ALERT if you have no idea who Mapplethorpe is) his death.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about the artists and the famous people they met yet they always returned to each other, both as lovers and ultimately as lifelong friends. This is a story of friendship, through hardscrabble times and drugs and love.

B00005ATQD|5.0|Tom Cruise is a doctor. Nicole Kidman is his wife in the movie and when the movie came out she actually was his wife in real life.<br /><br />Cruise is a very straight laced serious doctor but Kidman is wild and one night tells Cruise that she has had a serious fantasy about some other dude. Not Keith Urban, but some other dude she just happened to bump into in the movie. Cruise didn't know Kidman even thought things like this and he's trying to deal with it but keeps having flashes in his brain of a nekkid Nicole with other dudes.<br /><br />Doctor Cruise can't handle the truth! He's freaked out by his wife's thoughts but stays very calm because that's what serious doctors do. He starts to take a look around however and notices things like hookers and other chicks that like him.<br /><br />Tom Tom meets one of his old friends from medical school that plays for different bands. The friend dropped out of medical school. The friend gives Tom a super duper secret password to something wild and Tom has to wear a mask and costume to the secret crazy party.<br /><br />Something wild turns out to be some kind of freakazoid underground euro halloween sex club! Tom don't fit in and soon other people notice. Is Tom gonna get killed or what? Years later the real life Tom gets deep into the cult scene and stays there.<br /><br />It seems like a few seconds of a nude Nicole Kidman pops up every five-minutes or so. When she's not nekkid she's cussin'. No way Tom and Nicole can be proud that their kids will one day watch this movie. No one can deny the fact that they are both great actors and Nicole lets her accent slip maybe once in the entire movie. That fact would only be noticed by someone who has a great ear for that kind of stuff. It's amazing how American Nicole Kidman can sound.<br /><br />This ain't really a sex movie. It's just a very interesting crazy movie like a lot of Stanley Kubrick's stuff. This movie does not drag and despite the length of the film, when it ends, you want more and you're like \\"Oh man! It's over!\\"over!\\"
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|I bought this for my 6 year old son, as he loves Lego's and builds things every day, so this gift was a no brainer...at least that is what I thought.  The pace of the game is really slow, as you wait for the person to build and because there are limited number of Lego's you really need to figure out how to build what is on the card you draw.  This is an okay game, probably better for older kids.

B003V1WUKS|1.0|i think that despite what most other reviewers say that these are pieces of extremly well written literature. that is, until you get to the ending. i was able to really get into these stories until they reached the end. when it got to that point they just stop abruptly. these arnt so much stories as they are quick glimpses or memories about some degenerate kids. and i guess theres a place for that. its a pretty gritty and honest book. and theres a few good insights. i dont think franco should quit writing and stick to acting like all the reviewers on this website are saying, he just needs to master this craft. learn to write endings man! and ill buy your next book if you do that. the only stories that are really great are the 1st two. and the others are okay. i wouldnt reccomend buying it, but if a friend or someone owns it it would be worth borrowing and reading.

B00003CWRX|5.0|\\"The Insider\\" focuses on Jeffrey Wigand. He is an ex research scientist from the  Brown & Williamson tobacco plant. The reason he is fired, is because he finds out that the company has placed some illegal substances in their products.  Lowell Bergman, a representative from 60 minutes catches wind of this and wants Jeffrey to give an interview on 60 minutes, describing what wrong Brown & Williamson company have done.  Without giving out any more spoilers, I can't say much more about the plot.    What makes this film truly an epic film is the wonderful acting by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Pacino gives what is truly an Oscar worthy performance.    I highly recommend \\"The Insider\\" as it is not a simple film by any means, it requires you to think.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|There are only two such amplifiers on the market.  This kind or the Upbeat Audio Boostaroo for PC and Audio Apps - T613-EN.  The upbeat can be purchased under different names and from different stores.  I have both.  The Upbeat kind has the input wiring attached.  This failed after a year of use due to normal wear and tear (bending) near the jack.  In order not to repeat the issue, I bought this model.  I use these models in my car as a preamp for my mp3 player.  I only take it out of the car to charge it.  I use it during driving, which is a few hours/minutes a day.    Advantages to FiiO:  1) very small, nearly the size of a quarter  2) rechargable battery with miniusb plug.  Many other [[ASIN:B000EIWCFE Upbeat Audio T613-BNC Boostaroo for All Audio Application]]devices take this, so ease of use & availability.  3) sound seems slightly more clearer and more amplified than the Upbeat.  4) 2 audio wires included in box.    Disadvantages to FiiO:  1) battery life only a week or two.  the upbeat needs batteries, but they last a month+.  2) volume control onboard is redundant.  mp3 players have one.  I don't need 2 volume controls.   3) no audio bypass.  if you do not turn the amplifier on or if it runs out of battery, you must remove it from the \\"chain.\\"  This is inconvenient.  the Upbeat has a passthrough so on or off, you will hear the audio.

B00081U7HC|5.0|If you have never seen this movie, it is a MUST!  This is a classic - a fairytale romance between two highly unalike people, a wealthy businessman and a comman street \\"hooker\\".  The movie is filled with laughter and fun, and famous lines from this movie are still quoted today.  Julia Roberts has long been remembered for her beautiful long, red hair in this movie, and Robert Gere is the man of every woman's dreams.  They are a perfect match for the movie, which is filled with laughter and love and has a great fairytale ending!
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Admittedly, I haven't followed Accept all that closely over the last 20 years.  They were one of my favorite bands during the \\"Restless & Wild\\", \\"Balls to the Wall\\", \\"Metal Heart\\" era.  This CD was recommended to me so I checked out a few tracks and a buddy of mine bought it for me for Christmas.  Plain and simple, it rocks!!!  This is like a time warp as it is old school Accept.  If you are a fan of the earlier Accept material, you will love this CD.  It's solid all the way thru.  I'm only listening to it for the 2nd time right now and a couple of highlights for me are \\"Beat the Bastards\\", \\"Rolling Thunder\\", \\"Pandemic\\", and the title track.  It's not often that a CD hits me right off on the first listen these days.  I usually have to give it a couple of listens before it starts to sink in and grow on me but this one was great on the first time thru.  Great stuff!

0312600844|5.0|I have a sense that fifty years from now, American literature classes at Macalester and Swarthmore and Wesleyan will see Franzen's works in much the same light that I regarded Sinclair Lewis's social realism in Babbitt and Main Street when I was reading him in high school. Freedom, in particular, documents the dysfunctions of contemporary family life during our era with precision, humor and suspense. This is a brilliant and ambitious novel that seduces you into its multi-faceted world and forces you to reflect on your own feelings and sensibilities as an American living in 2010. I loved every page, and I delighted in Franzen's method of embedding the cunning device of Patty's autobiography within the early and late stages. In some respects, it gave me the sense of having come upon a series of documents dropped off on a park bench, with the task of attempting to piece together the whole story. There is much to reflect on beyond the plot itself. This novel spoke to me unlike any that I have read in the past ten years and for that I am grateful.

B004132HZS|5.0|I'm not a particularly big fan of Sherlock Holmes. I've seen various film and TV adaptations in the past (I've never read any of the stories) but I have always preferred Agatha Christie's detectives to Sherlock Holmes. But almost from the first moment of the first episode of this new series I was hooked. Everything about this series is first-rate, from the acting (Benedict Cumberbatch becomes Sherlock Holmes-it's amazing to watch!), the directing, the cinematography, the screenwriting, etc. I could go on and on. This DVD also includes the original pilot episode of \\"A Study in Pink\\" and i'ts fascinating to see how they changed/expanded the story for the final version. I also enjoyed the special on the making of the series and the commentaries by the actors and producers. This is an excellent example of taking something old and making it into something new. I highly recommend this DVD set!

B000YXMMAE|5.0|Yes, In Ra In Bows. It used to be that Radiohead where the bastards of Pink Floyd, but now have turned around and gone Wyatt. Amazing how history repeats itself. The feeling of wandering and wondering are In Ra In Bows. A world gone wrong. A world of mislead Hope. Were life is slowly loosing it´s meaning. Away from nature into digital reality. In Radio Heads. Like waking at the bottom of an aquarium in the middle of the night and asking oneself, can it be true? and believing that it is true. Gasping for air when no air is needed and accepting water into life. A musical journey into English minds gone world viral. The very inner deep side of Cold Play. It´s good to have extremes in the middle. Love it as it is....
B0040UAYI4|2.0|Not a \\"pro\\" gamer like some who've reviewed this product but came up through the ranks playing Doom, Quake and UT all the way to COD and BF2 titles on the PC. Got this to run BF2 Bad Company on the PS3 and my first pickle was using the repair tool to fix the jeep in the training level. Acted strangely and would only hook up on the Hummer to repair for abut 1 second out of like every 120. I jumped all over the vehicle and ran around it until my finger got tired.<br /> I got around this by using the regular controller and saving. Then I had to jump in the  Hummer and drive. Wrong ... Nothing mapped would control the vehicle. OK ... Maybe this works well with other games that don't have the vehicles that the BF series does, but that's my game of choice. I think Sony needs to pull their heads out and market a Keyboard and Mouse that doesn't need a conversion. Perhaps I should have looked into a Firmware patch or something, but I have gotten to the point where I'm tired of farting around with devices that should work as advertised, period. Not Ohh with this game and this configuration and with that patch and Ohh well you can do this but not do that...<br />So yes, this is as close as it gets to real PC action and if you want to fart with setting it up a little differently for different games and reconfiguring it all the time, then it will probably work for you. For me it was easier to go back to the PS3 controller and when I want to WASD just go back in and sit at my Quad Core with the NVIDIA GTX 470 and killer response time.
B001CTUI8M|3.0|As a big fan of gothic and symphonic metal, I bought this blu-ray with high expectations, but felt greatly disappointed by the sound recording. Throughout the concert, Sharon's vocals drowned out all the instruments except the orchestra! I love her voice, but not to the point where I can't hear any guitars and drums. They always sound one notch below Sharon's vocals. This way, Sharon sounded more like screaming and losing her pitch to the point where her voice became irritating. Not sure whether the recording was originally like that or there's a problem with my audio setup. However, I did try different settings, but to no avail. Has anyone else experienced the same problem with this blu-ray? in contrast, the visuals are fantastic. Plus, it has tons of extras and a bonus DVD with a very intresting documentary on their world tour. I really want to love this blu-ray, but I can only give it 3 stars since I can enjoy the concert only visually. Maybe the DVD version sounds better?
B0032O6S4I|5.0|My daughter got this from Santa and is absolutely, completely in love.  It really is a marvelous toy.  Though pricey, it's so much nicer than almost any other \\"made in China\\" toys out there on the market that cost almost as much.  There are a lot of pieces, and it does take time to assemble everything, but the quality cannot be beat.  No hanging upside down, desperately trying to match up poorly made screw holes or fit things where they refuse to fit.  These pieces snap together effortlessly and perfectly.  This is our second playmobil set (we have the dinosaurs and volcano) and I am sold.  Compared to the junk that is in most stores today, this is a quality toy that will last her through her childhood.  She loves the animals and the details are incredible, down to the flowers on the plants, the informational pictures for the animal pens, and the moving elephant ears!  My daughter also loves the tourists, especially the baby in the stroller.    Note that there are many, many, MANY tiny parts - brushes, leaves, flowers, buckets, hats - so make sure your child is old enough to manage keeping up with them all. It's a little clumsy to move once it's assembled, so put it where you'd like it to stay.  It can be moved in parts, but the fencing tends to unsnap apart if you try to move it all at once.  Enjoy this great toy!
B00003CXB4|5.0|I used to sit and watch this movie all day everyday. I knew every word and I could even act it out. I'm so glad they didn't just make the new version come out on DVD, because that would have been a disappointment. This edition comes with 2 discs. Disc one is the first edition that I know and love. The second disc is the \\"new\\" edition they added more stuff to. I started watching, and when Zazu started singing his new song \\"Morning Report\\" I stopped. It just wasn't right. Disney should just leave classics as they are, and don't try to fix something that is not, and probably never will be, broken.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I had not seen this at the movies. It has been 11 years since Toy Story 2,what a wonderful wait. They pick up in real time with him going off to college, and deciding what to do with his old toys. On my 11 foot screen the characters jump off the screen. And of course it is about the engaging story. Must have in your collection. Pixar does it again and again.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Not much to add beyond what other reviewers have said, but be aware that this product will off gas for quite some time.  It has a fairly potent chemical odor that won't quickly disperse.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Go back to your childhoood. The sound and the picture are outstanding. If you are a fan, you MUST own this blu ray set.
B00007FOMP|5.0|The best album of all time, as far as I'm concerned! The man was way ahead of his time and that's what makes this album so special. Right on, Marvin!
B00127RAJY|3.0|This DVD was not as good as I'd hoped. The work out was kind of boring. And Jillian wasn't as motivating as Jackie W. or other fitness/exercise DVD trainers. Maybe this would be a good DVD for someone who is fairly over weight - for someone who is in relatively good shape it was not. I will not buy another Jillian exercise DVD.
B003V6L94Q|4.0|Great performer, was disappointed in with this album because of song selections but I'm no producer just consumer. He has done a lot bet songs than a few of these and better earlier albums.
0307272702|5.0|I was unsure about whether to buy this book at all.  Wouldn't it just be a dumbed-down version of Good Calories Bad Calories (GCBC)?  Wouldn't it just reiterate the same points, just with less information and context?    Well I've just bought this book for kindle and couldn't stop reading until I finished it half a day later and I'm happy to say, that none of the above is true.    Ever since I've lost weight with the Atkins diet about 5 years ago I've read dozens of books worth of information on diet and metabolism.  This book is the most comprehensive, concentrated, thrilling and enlightening resource I've ever found.  Not only does it explain how the very misconceived notion about dieting and health could become accepted by the health sciences despite being flawed from the get go, no it gives the reader a working understanding of how one gets fat and what to do about it (as the title promises).  It's not by accident, that the only concrete dietary recommendations are found in the appendix - after reading the book the reader can come up with those themselves.    Beware though that the clear contrast between the logic in this book and the presented examples of conventional \\"logic\\" and the resulting epidemic of illness may temporarily raise your blood pressure despite being on a low carb/ paleo diet.    So to whom would I recommend this book?    Well obviously to anybody who wants to lose weight and hitherto wasn't able to do so.  To any low carber / paleo dieter who wants to know why what he does works .  It's also more of a treat for the paleo crowd, because it brings in evolution more for it's points than GCBC.    However there is another group who should read this - fans of science.  This book and the knowledge about obesity, in combination with GCBC has something which nearly all other diet books lack:  explanatory power, the power to explain large numbers of observations with an elegant hypothesis.  Have you ever wondered why some people get fat and others don't, why Asians remained lean until relatively recent - despite eating rice and such, why you get fatter with getting older, despite eating the same way?   You'll not only find the answer to those questions here but the knowledge to come up with these themselves.
B002WIDRM6|3.0|Could of had better songs like in past? Great performers with great harmony in their voices but album didn;t live up to my expectations.
0312600844|1.0|This book was a gift from a family member who had heard of its glowing recommendation from Oprah.  What an agonizing read.  The shallowness of the characters, the sameness of their dialogue,  and the disconnect of many of their unbelievable out-of-character actions made for bad storytelling.  This, along with the relentless cynical prose page after page, has taught me that the Oprah list is one I will stay away from in the future.
030746363X|5.0|If you are familiar with Tim's work, enjoy his writing style and blog, and are into nutrition and fitness in anyway, you will really enjoy this book.  I've purchased both the hardcover and Kindle editions and couldn't be happier with my purchases.  The focus on getting tested for inflammatory markers, vitamin and micro-nutrient deficiencies, etc. shine the light on preventative medicine and the profound difference it can make in your life.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|watched this many times with my daughter
B003KT3NRA|5.0|When I first heard that Vince Neil would be doing a solo project like I was doubtful,. However I'm admitting that my skepticism wasn't necessary. This is great album with brilliant songs. Well priced with 11 songs. Happy with my purchase.
B000AS4L16|5.0|I bought this version of Shoah almost four years ago. There was no American version, and there still isn't one.  I have had no technical problems with it.  Others on Amazon have described the content.  I do not know how to speak about that content. Perhaps, no one really can. I do know, however, that this massive effort is the closest I have ever come to understanding/feeling the Shoah. As others on Amazon have said, Lanzmann created a masterpiece. This is true. The film is literally unforgettable.  That there is no American version of such an important and powerful film both puzzles and depresses me. Why do we have to buy a British or a Korean version decades old? What does this lack of American availability say about us as a people? There is something wrong here, and I don't know but that the fault is in me - in my being a \\"stander-by\\" to the indifference that seems to be prevalent. I need to bear witness. We need to bear witness.
143911000X|5.0|If you're a HIMYM fan, this is a hiliarious book. I gave it as a gift and the recipients loved it!
1439152780|4.0|I very much enjoyed Kate Morton's first two novels: \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" and \\"The House at Riverton.\\"  Thus I eagerly awaited the release of \\"The Distant Hours.\\"  This book reprises the general framework Kate Morton's other two:  A mystery is buried in the past. The present day protagonist seeks to uncover its secrets.  The narration gracefully moves back and forth between time frames and we become involved with characters from both present and past.  I enjoyed \\"The Distant Hours\\" well enough, but it felt a bit more formulaic and less inspired than Ms. Morton's other novels.  Still---those who liked \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" and \\"The House at Riverton\\" should enjoy \\"The Distant Hours,\\" if nothing else for its similarity to the previous two Kate Morton books.  If you are deciding which Kate Morton book to buy, however, I would more strongly recommend either \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" or \\"The House at Riverton\\" over \\"The Distant Hours.\\"
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was my favorite book in the Percy Jackson series by far! It revolves around battle much more than any others, which brought even more excitement and action. Although this book has a very serious setting compared to the other books, the humor is still there, and so is the romance. A great ending to a great series, Riordan leaves you satisfied, yet it will also leave you craving for more Percy. So much so that after finishing it, I didn't want to read anything else for a while after becoming so attached to the world of Percy Jackson! This it a great book-don't hesitate to read it!
B001U3Y5XE|2.0|We were really enthusiastic about playing this game as a family.  My boys LOVE legos and I played with them a ton as a kid.  However, you're just given a handful of each color and a bunch of weird little blocks that you have to really think outside the box on how to use.  So in that respect it's good as a brain-teaser I suppose, because you have to try really hard to figure out how to make your creation with the tiny amount of blocks you have.  Unfortunately this also makes it pretty frustrating and you end up with things like a patchwork green/red/gray/yellow chicken or whatnot, so guessing from color is pretty much out the window.  The pictures are also really hard and overly detailed.  (One one turn I got the Sydney Opera House?!!?)  We still did have some fun with it, but overall we couldn't help but keep voicing our frustrations throughout the game, and no one seems to be very excited about playing it again.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a fun challenging game. It is possible to move the hexagons to create a whole new board for a new game. I really enjoy playing it. If you have more than 4 people in the house, you might want the extension pack.
B00428ZRFE|4.0|I enjoyed Rihanna's new album from start to finish.  She sang the songs well and the album flowed beautifully.  I listen to her album from beginning to end and enjoy it tremendously.
0321687299|5.0|I don't usually read technical books front to back, this one I did! The authors kept it interesting and (mostly) pertinent :)
B00004SA8A|5.0|In his notes to his recording of the complete Schubert sonatas, Wilhelm Kempff quotes a comment about Schubert attributed to the composer's friend and patron, the singer Johann Michael Vogl:<br /><br />\\"'You see', Vogl was usually heard to say in a low voice, indicating with a sideways glance, when Schubert stood lost in thought, unaware of his surroundings, \\"the man has no idea what is alive within him!  It is an inexhaustible flood!\\"<br /><br />With their introspection, long wandering themes, sponanaiety,lyricism, and frequent pregnant pauses, Schubert's piano sonatas are an inexhaustible flood indeed. Most of Schubert's piano sonatas were ignored for years.  Only in the mid-20th Century did they come into their own.<br /><br />Kempff (1895 -- 1991) is best-known for his recordings of the complete Beethoven and Schubert sonata cycles.  He recorded the Schubert sonatas between 1965 and 1969 in Hannover, Germany.  The set is available in this 7-CD compilation from DG at a budget price. Kempff plays the sonatas with a restrained lyrical romanticism.  The readings are quiet, meditative and focused. Kempff seldom loses sight of the broad structure of the music in its long, meandering passages.<br /><br />I first got to know Schubert's sonatas long ago in LPs of Kempff's recordings of the final two: the A major sonata, D. 959 and the B-flat major sonata, D. 960. It was good to revisit these readings again after many other performances have been sandwiched between in the course of years.  The A major, in particular, receives an outstanding performance as Kempff brings out the flailing sorrow of the second movement and the serene musical lyricism of the finale. Beyond these two final masterworks, I had not heard Kempff's Schubert sonatas until I purchased this set.<br /><br />I wanted to hear Kempff's reading of an earlier A major sonata, D. 664, opus 120, because I have been learning to play it. Kempff plays this youthful work with, the slow movement excepted, a light joyful character.  He also observes both Schubert's repeats in the opening movement. While Kempff's reading of this music is idiomatic and convincing, it reminded me of the many possibilities of interpretation for this deceptively simple and apparently naive score.  I also enjoyed Kempff's readings of the sonata in a minor, D. 784, opus 143, a lyrical work of a different character from its A major companion that was composed at about the same time. It is among several of the many Schubert sonatas that deserve to be better known.<br /><br />Other outstanding performances include the long, tragic c minor sonata, D. 958, part of the final trilogy composed in the last months of Schubert's life together with the A major, D. 959, and B-flat major, D. 960, sonatas. The extensive, late G major sonata, D. 894, opus 78, receives a somewhat lighter interpretation at Kempff's hands, than under many other readings of this transcendent work. Kempff brings out the heroic, large scale qualities of the D major sonata, D. 850, opus 53, the tragic qualities of the A minor sonata, D. 845, opus 42, and the stunning, unfinished sonata in C major, D. 840, known as the \\"Relique\\".<br /><br />Besides Kempff's own introduction to the sonatas, this set includes a good introductory analysis, \\"Form and Feeling in the Schubert Sonatas\\" by John Reed together with a chronology. Both will be useful to the new listener. Given the music, the performance, and the low price, this set is a treasure both for listeners new to Schubert and to those listeners who have not yet heard Kempff's recordings. This is music to hear when you are alone with yourself.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanyful character.  He also observes both Schubert's repeats in the opening movement.

0399536108|5.0|I've followed Chris Guillebeau's Art of Non-Conformity blog for awhile, and was excited to see that he had written a book that focused on his message of living life on your own terms.  I picked up The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World and started it yesterday evening.  I didn't put it down until I finished, and then ordered my own copy today to take over from the library copy I had.  This is an excellent book, and has me re-examining why I do what I do (and why I don't pursue the things I really want to accomplish).<br /><br />Contents:<br />Part 1 - The Remarkable Life: Sleepwalkers and the Living World; Setting the Terms of Your Unconventional Life; Smashing Through the Brick Wall of Fear; How to Fight Authority and Win<br />Part 2 - Reclaiming Work: Competence Is Your Security; Graduate School vs. the Blogosphere; The Power of Your Own Small Army; The Personal Finance Journey<br />Part 3 - The Power of Convergence: Radical Exclusion and the Quest for Abundance; Contrarian Adventures; Your Legacy Starts Now<br />Conclusion: Dangerous Ideas<br />Postscript - The Most Important Thing; Gratitude; Partnership with Charity - Water and Ethiopia; Frequently Asked Questions; Online Resources<br /><br />Chris has never been one to do the conventional thing.  He went to college after dropping out of high school as a sophomore.  He enrolled in multiple colleges at one time to get his degree more quickly and save money.  He started numerous businesses as he didn't want to work for someone else and be dependent on them for a paycheck.  He volunteered on a medical ship for four years in West Africa.  He has a goal to visit all 192 countries in the world (and he's within striking distance of it).  Basically, he's accomplished more than any five \\"normal\\" people put together, and it's all because he refuses to let others dictate his lifestyle because \\"that's the way it's supposed to be done.\\"  Rather than say it's better to ask forgiveness than permission, he figures (and rightfully so, in my opinion) that most situations don't require *either*.  You simply have to make up your mind to do something, and then act.  Chris shares his philosophy and experiences in a conversational manner, and it reached past my normal cynical filters and made me consider what it is I do and why I do it.<br /><br />I've got some dreams and goals I haven't been pursuing with any level of commitment or urgency.  The Art of Non-Conformity made me realize that I'm so much further ahead in some areas than I give myself credit for, and there's no reason why I can't build on that and start to accomplish those things that I think about when I let my imagination go.  Once my copy shows up from Amazon, I'll be re-reading certain chapters and focusing on making 2011 a far different year than 2010.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedures (and rightfully so, in my opinion) that most situations don't require *either*.

030746363X|5.0|Great job, Tim Ferriss! I admit that I had never heard of him before and have not read his 4 Hour Work Week book....yet. I receive emails from trainer Joel Marion and he mentioned this book being 'progressive in making a better you'. At $14, how could one not give it a look?     I wrapped it for myself and opened it on Christmas. I spent the majority of the evening reading this intriguing book. I am a RN and require the \\"science\\" of why something works. Tim Ferriss provides this. In some chapters I thought, \\"what were you thinking?!\\" with some of his experiments, but how cool is it that someone is willing to do things like ice baths or weigh their poo to prove a theory? Thank you, Tim! I bet you are an interesting dinner companion....I would love to pick your brain! Keep your inquiring mind active and please keep enlightening us with what you learn!
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I purchased this album for the one song \\"Just the way you are\\" and the price was reasonable. I was pleasantly surprised at the calibur of talent this guy has. I am in love with the songs from \\"Marry You\\" (My new favorite) to Grenades.. He is truly genius.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|the case of the dvd was incredible..nothing was wrong with it so far. the movies are in perfect shape. i wouldnt change it for anything. i got it for a christmas present for my mom and it got here before it was scheduled to so that made me happy. i would def purchase something for Amazon again :)
B0027HOBM2|5.0|Mad Men Season Two is when this show really hit its stride and proved it had staying power.  The commentaries are delicious and captivating.  Don't watch this before you watch season one.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had ended up having to read this book for a school project. Id heard from one of my friends it was really good. I fell in love with this book. For people looking for an interesting book to read I would definatly recommend they pick up a copy or possibly download it on their kindle if the have one. I also believe Collins is a very talented author.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|When my 4 month old opened this on Christmas, she starting squealing.  So much so that we had to immediately take it out of the box.  She then proceeded to hold it, stare at the mirror part, and make the music play and then she proceeded take 2 naps with it - with her hand on it at all times.  If anyone tried to remove it, she immediately started screaming.  She also quickly learned how to make the music start by moving her feet on the wheel.  I can't wait until she is able to crawl along with it.    It really is adorable and can function three ways.    1 - crawl along, the snail rolls forwards and backwards and plays a tune  2 - sit and play, the snail rocks back and forth that will activate the music  3 - stand still, the snail is stationary but the ladybug moves and that will activate the music    This toy is a keeper!
0810993139|5.0|Hilarious book- had to buy it for my 23 year old brother so he could reminisce, too! Really captures the middle school kid's dramatic view on life.
B001GQSY5K|4.0|This is a fun take on the Star Wars universe. It was made to set up the kid's show that is now in its third season on Cartoon Network. There are significant changes from the traditional Star Wars movies that we fell in love with, but they are all acceptable. It is clearly made for children to enjoy, but even adults can have a good time watching it. If you keep a lighthearted mindset throughout and expect to enjoy it, then you will.
B003VS0CWY|1.0|The Sound of Music (film) is wonderful but I bought this version for the DVD (only) after enjoying so much, the \\"5-Star Collection\\" edition that I bought my parents for their anniversary.  (THAT version was a big HIT!)  I don't have a Blu-ray player & I don't care about getting one.  Picture on my 46\\" Sony Bravia LCD is spectacular enough.  This edition is advertised as a 45th Anniversary with several Special Features!  If you buy it for the DVD, you WON'T BE ABLE TO WATCH *ANY* OF THEM!!!!!!!  The LEAST they could do is include the same Special Features on the DVD, putting them on more than one DVD-disc, if necessary.  There are only two measly \\"Special\\" Features on the DVD.  They are SOOOOOOO UNBELIEVABLY LAME! It practically adds insult to injury.  One is a 3-min AD for the tour company in Salsburg that apparently still does Sound of Music tours.  The other, the Sing-Along, is just stupid.  The Karaoke-style lyrics display during the musical numbers but but cuts out the beautiful voice track.  So you hear the instrumentals ONLY, without Julie Andrews beautiful voice & (Ohhhh Great) only your 80-yr old Aunt Bertha singing every number.  If you only want the DVD, AVOID THIS EDITION & GET THE \\"5-STAR COLLECTION\\" INSTEAD!!!
B003V63VNI|5.0|Brandon Boyd is amazing and this CD will not let you down, especially if you are already an Incubus fan!  A great buy!!!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my son.  The sound of the mono set is outstanding and they remind me of the original vinyl.  The packaging is good and the artwork from the original albums is a nice touch.  If you have not listened to the original mono cuts I recommend listening, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B000SEI230|5.0|this book is the best book i have ever read it is so touching it shows you how the world used to be...the two main people in this story really feel love. when i was reading this book i truly felt like i was apart of the story.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|If you are a fan of the director, or a fan of comics, or a fan of videogames; Buy this movie.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan has done it again! This is an action packed book with twist and turns all in it. Like the series of Percy Jackson. This is all about the greek gods and there children. There is new characters and old characters in this book. So have fun reading readers.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I had this movie on vhs before I picked this up.  Seriously, If you need a review, that means you haven't seen this movie yet.  You have to.  Just buy it.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|Ok, so I've had this product for over 6 months I believe. The surround sound is stupendous, signal is pretty strong, and chat booster allows for better communication. The only down side, which I find to be a big issue personally, is the fact that it runs off of two AAA batteries, which tend to run out of juice quickly! This is very annoying when playing a game of Search and Destroy on Black Ops, and all of a sudden you lose all communication. There I am rushing to find my other pair of rechargeable batteries and wasting valuable minutes of gameplay.     So that's the only real annoying issue that I've had with this headset. I mean if you don't mind switching out batteries very often, then go for it.
0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss...  What a great title, don't you think?  I absolutely fell in love with this story - about American Anna being sent off to boarding school in none other than Paris.  With no friends or family in Paris - Anna finds herself alone and crying over her circumstance.  Luckily the girl next door hears her wailing and takes pity on poor Anna and invites her over for some hot chocolate (because really, hot chocolate is soothing to the soul).  Through her new friend she meets other kids that also attend the school, but she especially meets Etienne St. Claire.  Etienne - the perfect boy, he's cute, funny, smart, he's into history, has a British accent (which I find quite sexy), and he is a great friend to Anna.<br /><br />I loved the relationship between Anna and Etienne.  Ms. Perkins realistically captures this couple's relationship perfectly.  Although I do believe in love at first sight, that is usually not the case.  Relationships take time - sometimes they start through friendship and slowly evolve into more.  That is the case with Anna and Etienne.  Two individuals who are not perfect, yet they are perfectly flawed.  I loved everything about them.<br /><br />Aside from the romance (le sigh), the descriptions of Paris are so stunningly visual.  I loved reading about the local hangouts, the museums, the restaurants, the theatre... but especially, the food.  I think I may just need a trip to Paris to verify facts (wink wink).<br /><br />In conclusion, I can honestly say that Anna and the French Kiss lives up to the hype.  It really is awesome.  It is a sweet romance that will have you feeling so warm and fuzzy inside I guarantee you'll feel all yummy for a while just thinking about it.  One of the best books I've read this year.  I cannot recommend it enough.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love spy stories, but I was reluctant to see this movie in the theaters because I thought the comedic aspect of it would make it a disaster.  Boy, was I wrong.  This film, with it's awesome cast, is the perfect blend of comedy and action and a must-have for any spy fan. Definitely grab this one.
B00125WAWS|5.0|This movie was a requirement as my speech project in college.  I totally recommend this movie and if it wasn't for school I would have never seen this movie.  Never saw it advertised.  It is a movie with a life lesson on speeches that everyone can benefit from the film. If you take a speech class you will definately relate to the film.
0812548094|3.0|Note: I would read book one first entitled Wizard's First Rule.<br /><br /> I don't usually read books over 800 pages. Why? Because I get bored. That is why I don't read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time saga anymore. By no means are Jordan's books badly written, I just get confused with which character does what.<br /><br />When I started Terry Goodkind's gigantic Sword of Truth saga, I was worried he'd confuse me later. Thankfully, he did not. He kept me on my toes throughout Wizard's First Rule , throwing shocker after shocker, and awesome fights reminiscent of R.A Salvatore.<br /><br />Book two, Stone of Tears begins with a bang, and ends with a bang, with smatterings of classic political tension, and true love in the classical sense.<br /><br />This isn't a book for the faint of heart. Action is bloody and very graphic. And yes, there is sexual tension ( the kind which can be skipped over, without losing important information.). And even cannibalism.<br /><br />The villains are very, and I mean very diabolical. The kind of villains that are dangerously too smart for their own good (which eventually gets them killed.).<br /><br />Goodkind also weaves heroes that actually act like real people, by the way they think, feel and act. You will be able to relate to most of the heroes, and yes even the villains.<br /><br />I give this book 3 stars out of 5.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This film is great!  I almost decided not to buy it, due to the negative comments here.  This film is a must see!  Great story, great characters, good visuals, and great acting!
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I use this with my 4th generation iPod Touch, and it's like bread and butter; perfect!    The iPod fits perfectly, it's very stable, and it's compact!  Perfect for making videos with iPod Touch 4g!
B000M5AJQI|4.0|The movie is superb and the Blu-ray makes it even better. Good value for money.  Must have in a collection if you like crime/thriller genre.
0385342039|5.0|I've always enjoyed Kinsella's Shopaholic books, but I especially love Twenties Girl.  The premise is both touching and funny.  A great aunt who dies at the age of 105, forgotten by the world, never visited by family. The ghost of this same aunt, in the form of her flapper 23 year old self, haunting her great-niece. The mystery of a lost necklace. The truth of a girl who stupidly pines for an ex.  And a cast of interesting characters. You'll be riveted and endlessly entertained as you flip the pages of this novel, and let it work its own ghostly magic on you.<br /><br />One especially beautiful scene occurs when the heroine visits a nursing home and sees the youthful spirits in each wheelchair bound elder rise up and dance. Fabulous writing.<br /><br />You might hear people refer to this dismissively as chicklit and light and fluffy. But, honestly, it was a hoot to read, engrossing, and had some real depth. Everything you could want from a book on a cold wintry afternoon. Highly recommended.

0385341008|5.0|Just finished The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,  I couldn't put it down.  Ms. Shaffer was a truely talented writer,  I wish that she'd had time to write more books.  Great book!
B003DT19F0|4.0|Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue is a cute movie, but it isn't as good as the first two.  The first two had more comedy and action.  This one focuses more on the father/daugther relationship.  If you get a good deal (1/2 price) on it like I did on Amazon.com the weekend after Thanksgiving, it's worth getting.  I sure wouldn't give the full price for it, though.
B002ZG980U|2.0|Just couldn't suspend my disbelief enough for this one... I kept wondering if any of it was actually plausible, even within the universe the movie was creating. The Prestige is a much better Christopher Nolan film, and of course the Batman movies.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|The reason i am unhappy with this order is that you sent me the wrong movie. I ordered Twilight, new moon, and eclipse. You sent new moon with a movie which was not eclipse part of the twilight saga, but some movie called THE ECLIPSE I would like the right movie sent please as I already paided for it and the movie you sent is older than time, isn't worth the dollar amount I already paid for. I am still waiting for twilight, please correct and send out the right movie (ECLIPSE PART OF THE TWILIGHT SAGA)    Thank you    Cheri O'Neill
B0036EH3WU|5.0|When this is on the lighting deal, it is a MUST get for me. NO REGRET AT ALL!<br />I watched everything on my laptop. With this, I can finally watch on my big TV screen!<br />It's very well packaged with so much details. The real life set looks even better than the photo. Even my dad is very impressed with it. I have to keep asking him to stop touching it.<br />And there is so much bonus stuffs...I only started watching LOST this year. So I haven't watch all the bonus clips yet! Can't wait to watch them!!<br />I am also very impressed with the DVD menus. The menus on each disc shows a different background. I don't think I have another TV sets that has this. They just stick to the boring same background.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is the cardboard sleeve packing. I prefer plastic case. But the backing seems pretty smooth.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|First of all...wow. this book is too good for words.    I am a kid who can't put these books down.  Rick, don't listen to anyone who tells you your books are anything less than stunning. By the way, what is a snausage?
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I had figured that this was a kid's movie, but rented it because of the great reviews.  I loved it so much that I went ahead and bought it. It's one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can love, for different reasons.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I'd been wanting to see this series since I'm too cheap to subscribe to HBO and I prefer to wait until these series come out on DVD so that I can have a group video session where we can watch as many episodes as possible and get the continuity that allows.  Although written-directed-produced by basically the same people as Band of Brothers, and about the same overall conflict, Pacific is unique on many levels largely because the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) was a completely different type of warfare.  I won't belabor my review with an explanation of this, but suffice it to say, it has a completely different \\"feel\\" than BofB; not any less of a production, maybe even better, but different mood all together.      One should be prepared for a different type of warfare being waged by a different enemy.  For a prelude, I would recommend reading \\"Flyboys\\" by James Bradley in order to have an understanding behind the type of warfare that was waged in the Pacific by Allied forces against the Empire of Japan.  Much has been written about this conflict, but little has addressed the causes of the war and why the war was so brutal from the perspective of both sides.    That being said, \\"Pacific\\" is a great series to own because, at least for me, I missed a lot during the first viewing sort of like Band of Brothers, which I've viewed probably 40-50 times, and learn some new detail each time.  I found it hard to retain the names and significane of the people being portrayed after only one viewing and I remembered that only after watching BofB multiple times was I able to retain a comfort with who each person was and what they contributed to the conflict.    Highly recommended!
0316789720|4.0|I bought this book for my 8-year old son.  Five minutes after receiving it he drew me a train.  The book basically uses simple shapes and strokes set up in a series across the page of the book.  It shows both the stroke/shape and what the picture should look like after that stroke/shape.  We are not ready to sell my son's work yet, but he is having fun trying.

B00005214X|5.0|I had originaly bought All Things Must Pass as a Christmas present for my wife. But after we sat down to listen to it, I was taken back to when I first listened to it many years ago.

1439177783|5.0|I finished reading the memoir in a day after watching Portia's interview on Ellen.  This is not a \\"how to\\" manual of any sort, as other reader's suggest.  This memoir is a troubling account of a disease that consumed a very talented and beautiful woman for nearly two decades.  I have never dealt with an eating disorder of my own but I've witnessed several friends delve into that terrority and others dive in head first until they are drowning in it.  From watching the interview, I knew that the book doesn't focus on the passing of her father.  The author is only now trying to come to terms with his death after years of struggling with anorexia and bulemia.<br /><br />While this book is not a guide on recovery, it is a true, honest account of how someone that the world views as beautiful and successful struggles with self image, doubt and feelings of inadequacy.  Perhaps, I enjoyed this book so much because of how much the interview with Ellen touched me.  This is clearly not another celebrity on a tour of self promotion looking to enhance their celebrity status.  This is a woman who wrote a book as a way to accept and heal from years of battling with disease.  The book does not try to win your sympathy.  In fact, it doesn't try to do anything other than honestly tell a story of how the author's perception of will power, self control and self doubt consumed her into a life that nearly killed her.<br /><br />The book never pretends to be a tell all tale of life on the Ally McBeal set.  I think Portia has too much class to comment on the other actors she has worked with.  After all, it didn't matter what set she was on or which camera she was in front of.  Her quest and demand for perfection warped her sense of being and clouded all rational thought during the difficult time in her life.<br /><br />I believe Portia is very brave.  Her detailed account of her own body and her comments on the bodies of those she scrutinized as part of the disease are nothing more than brutally honest.  She never pretends that her scrutiny was reserved for herself.  To do so, or avoid the topic entirely, would be a lie.<br /><br />We live in a society where Spanx are sold in extra small and jeans can be a size 00.  How can someone's size be less than zero?  How can someone that is categorized as an extra small need to feel that they have to hold in their stomach with an uncomfortable, albeit flattering, piece of spandex? So called \\"normal\\" people are held to a standard barely attainable without a nutritionist, personal trainer and live in chef. Actresses are held to an even higher standard considering they have the means to obtain a nutrionist, trainer and chef.  Models are 14 years old and prepubescent.  Some will never even menstruate because of the starvation practices they inherit as part of the job.  On the other end of the spectrum, people in this country are morbidly obese.  We are a nation consumed by food.  We are either consumed by what we can't have and when we can't have it or consumed by fast food and larger than life portion sizes.<br /><br />Though the book doesn't focus on recovery, one of the truest passages comes during the brief description of Portia's relationship with her girlfriend Francesca.  It was from this relationship that her toxic relationship with food began to change.  She no longer saw food as something she had to devour now because she wasn't going to get any more of it for a long while.  She learned that food is to be enjoyed in moderation and that it will always be around.  It stopped being a now or never phenomenon.<br /><br />Does Portia pretend to be completely healed?  No, she claims to be better.  I hope writing this book not only helped her but also helps so many others.  I think any woman, with or without an eating disorder, can relate in some way to what is described in this book.  If someone as beautiful and talented as Portia can succumb to the pressures of perceived beauty in today's society than the restof us are surely susceptable as well.  Thank you, Portia.l.   Thank you, Portia.

B003R0LBVW|4.0|Stick with this one past the lame-ish beginning and it gets very interesting -- particularly if you are middle aged, maybe better if you're a woman. The format is unique (alternates between objective narrative voice and autobigraphy written by the protagonist)and I think it works. Ultimately, this book is about the choices that we make (and usually regret) and what happens if you embrace them instead. It's kind of a take on \\"be careful what you wish for\\", but not that pedantic. Life is short and freedom can be found within the perceived boundaries of the lives that we have constructed for ourselves, whether deliberately or not.

B0000E2FLC|5.0|I got this DVD as a gift for Christmas this year (among other things).  I have been a fan of the band for years. They ARE Rock n' Roll. This is an incredible concert, and very well filmed.  The music ROCKS!!! The set list is great, and the sound quality is top notch.  The DVD also has some really cool features such as commentary by Malcolm and Angus Young themselves. AC/DC played an incredible gig, and you can watch this concert over and over.  So glad I got it, and I am definitely looking forward to jammin' out time and time again!.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|A few years ago, I read Daniel Woodrell's WINTER'S BONE and found much to admire.  Set in the most destitute portions of our nation, the Ozark country of southern Missouri...it told the story of young Ree Dolly, a 17-year-old girl and her desperate efforts to find her missing father and bring him to court before his bail is revoked.  Because the bail her dad put up was the deed to the Dolly house and land.  This would have left Ree and her two young siblings and her mentally ill mother homeless.    The book showed in great detail a land wracked by poverty and ruined by crystal meth.  An insular society where the only code is not revealing anything to the outside world, especially law enforcement.  But a society where women, especially teen girls, are not allowed to snoop and pry into the doings of the men.  A society in which being beaten or killed for asking the wrong question is tolerated.  A world of grinding poverty, poor health care and terrible education.  And in the midst of all this, was the heroic Ree...smarter than everyone around her, but also forced to accept a role beyond her years.      The book was atmospheric and well-written.  But it was slowly paced and ultimately a bit boring.    Now the film version has come along, and it captures the book nearly perfectly.  Both the successes and the failures.  The film does an outstanding job of capturing the landscape and the desolation.  There are many movies that show bleak landscapes and somehow make them beautiful.  WINTER'S BONE shows an area that is deeply unattractive and does not try to show any hidden beauty or stark nobility.  It's cold and it's covered with trash.  You look at the land, and realize that no one COULD ever prosper there...the poverty we see has bled into the land.  This is very effectively captured throughout the movie.    Ree Dolly, who is in every scene of the film, is played by Jennifer Lawrence.  She looks a little like a young, cherubic Renee Zellweger.  It's her first major role, and she is thoroughly committed and accomplished.  Her accent is perfect, and she captures the great intelligence of her character.  It's an intelligence that has been muted by circumstance.  And she's also very brave, because she knows she has no choice but to succeed in her quest, even at the risk of her own safety.  Most other roles are fairly small, but all are played well.  I particularly liked John Hawkes, who played Ree's Uncle Teardrop.  A mildly dangerous man who feels compelled to help out his kin.    So there was much to admire in the film.  It certainly treated the book faithfully.  And thus, the movie was slowly paced and boring.  It was frankly hard to care much about most of the characters.  Even Ree is mostly compelling intellectually, not emotionally.  Everyone tends to move very slowly, and there are just a lot of scenes of Ree walking from place to place.  Again, we get a GREAT sense of the place...but if I just wanted to look at landscapes, I'd watch a Terrence Malick film.  I want some compelling story, purpose or character to draw me along...and to a large extent, that is just missing.   And as with the book, the ending is anti-climactic.  It fits the whole morose, slow-paced tone of the story...but it also results in a film that never raises our pulse.  Honestly, I simply struggled to remain awake to the end, even though the movie is only 98 minutes.    Jennifer Lawrence may get a well-deserved boost to her career with WINTER'S BONE.  And often, a good performance is enough for me to recommend seeing a film...I think good acting needs to be seen and appreciated.  However, the film has too many other problems, and I'd recommend passing by this dark, dreary journey.

The only thing I don't like is that they don't show you, in English, how to say the word. It tells the definition in English, but the pronunciation in Katakana or Hiragana.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums, and I've never liked a movie soundtrack like this, NEVER! All the songs on here are great, and if you are a Twilight fan you begin to remember what scene each song is from. The songs are varied which other reviewers have mentioned, some are slow and mellow, while others are more upbeat, but that's just like New Moon. It's an excellent and unique mix you're sure to love.
B004856SQ8|4.0|I have to say that before watching this movie, I had only seen one episode of the original A Team series.  I didn't enjoy the series too much, but I did enjoy this movie.  Its not often you see an action/adventure movie that at least tries to have a plot, but this one did.<br /><br />Starting in Mexico, we are introduced to John \\"Hannibal\\" Smith (Liam Neeson) who is being held hostage by police officers and we see just how resourceful he is.  He escapes and with the help of B.A. Baracus (Quinton Jackson) set out to free another member of his team Templeton \\"Face\\" Peck who is also being held by the corrupt Mexicans.  Along the way, they enlist the help of the slightly crazy H.M. Murdock (Sharlto Copley), an expert pilot.  Together, they outsmart the bad guys and go on to become a successful special ops team with the American Army.<br /><br />Not all goes as planned though.  When sent on a mission to recover some treasury plates, things go horribly awry and the team is wrongfully convicted when a general is murdered and the plates go missing.  They have to escape from jail and seek out the plates in order to restore their good names.  They have a lot of opposition however.  Despite being backed by CIA Agent Lynch (Patrick Wilson) they are pursued by the military and Face's former lover Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel), and private security leader Brock Pike (Brian Bloom).  With a lot of adventure, explosion, and action, the team has to succeed as there is no plan B.<br /><br />I have to say, just knowing from popular culture about BA when played by Mr. T, Jackson just doesn't measure up to his character despite good acting.  Its a hard role to fill and they just didn't develop his character correctly.  The rest, from the little I know, did an ok job and I especially liked Face as a character.  He was just a bit more entertaining than the rest.  The bad guys weren't particularly menacing despite their guns and bombs.  Jessica Biel did so so in her role and I think they could have really expanded on her part and gave more depth to her character.<br /><br />This movie had some great action scenes.  While they were largely unbelievable from a logical standpoint (how they survived some of that stuff especially) it made for good entertainment and kept you at the edge of your seat.  There were of course lots of pretty explosions which always add to an action movie and quite a bit of gun fighting.  This could potentially be a violent movie for younger kids.<br /><br />The music in this was ok.  Nothing really stood out to me.  I do know that they used some of the original music tracks from the series.<br /><br />If you're looking for action this movie probably has enough.  Aside from some weak character development it was a pretty decent movie.  Grab some popcorn and enjoy!<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2010on her part and gave more depth to her character.

B000CCIVDO|4.0|Got this from another store.Sounds great. For its price it actually exceeded expectations. This seems good enough for professional stuff. It fits to both 1/4 and 1/8 inch TRS output. By default it comes with the 1/4 inch plug, but once you unscrew the detachable plug, the 1/8 inch plug is 'hidden' inside. Before I discovered this I was about to buy a 1/8 converter! The plug looks solid and no chance of a loose and noisy connection.<br />However, in terms of comfort, the ear-pads could have been better (and a little bit bigger I guess) as it tends to get uncomfortable if you wear it for hours at a stretch. The cord should have been longer.Apart from that this is awesome. No artificial bass boost, noise cancelling etc...you just hear what you record..plain and simple sound. I recommend this to anyone..specially those who are semi-professional.

0385738757|5.0|To start off, I think it is unfair to say that these characters are not compelling.  Through their actions and dialogue, they are well defined and truly make an impression on the reader.  And their use of \\"shuck\\", only enhances the story.  It doesn't confuse you because the word really doesn't have a meaning.  This story keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way.  And for the girls who read this book, there is a little love triangle mixed in.  This book picks up extremely fast.  Like I'm talking from the first page.  Make sure you remember many of the minor details from the first book.  James Dashner uses these to connect his sequel back to the first book and they really enhance the story.  They could be missed out on if your confused by James's references.  The end has a cliff hanger that will leave you puzzled, scared, excited, and demanding that Mr.Dashner hurry up and come out with the last book.

B003ZSH606|1.0|In the last several years before this long awaited 'creative' effort, JK (like many other artists) has spent (& lost) lots of his energy fighting his previous record label (Sony) for more artistic control.     Now that he is freed from the evil tyrants (that made him a star) & been fully granted all the control he'd seek, it is quite aggravating, brutal even, to witness the lack of creativity presented here. Sadly for any music lover & even sadder for any true fan, five years in the waiting, what you get here is a mismatched, uninspired, time-filling, disconnected mixture of what could have barely graced b-sides of his past-life singles.     Be-side (pun intended) 'White Knuckle Ride', an uplifting & infectiously effective 'disco-electro' classic JK track (that I suspect, as it is so far off the rest of the album, was destined for a previously unreleased effort), there isn't anything quite aurally spectacular anymore about Jamiroquai's music. The writing is rather futile (compared to his usually intricate lyrics), the arrangements are repetitive & uninspired, the melodies are, for the most part, weak & fast forgotten. Even the self-loathing cover of the record suggest he's over the hill or well on his way there.     When JK was in his prime, the Buffalo Man was often used to distance his pretty looks from his art. And since the art was so incredibly good, one couldn't care less that no pics were found inside the booklets. One would focus on the groovy music & luscious, deliriously vintage arrangements instead. If there was a time I wished the B-Man was dusted off & put back to use on a cover, it has to be on this one. JK looks almost ridiculous. Even his facial expression seems to suggest: 'Don't I look silly?'     Don't get me wrong: I simply adore & respect this artist, i really do. Jamiroquai (Jay Kay) is a master at what he does. A skilled producer, a (usually very) inspired & inspiring writer surrounded by great, almost surreal musicians / vocalists. But let'sbe frank, if Jamiroquai was still under Sony's management, this record would have NEVER been released.     Stupendously, tyrannous record companies will often protect artists from attempting to release any crap they make, especially when they're so full of themselves to think ANY of their offering is good enough to go platinum. This was, several years ago, why JK got out of Sony, yet this is exactly one of those moments when a higher power should have stopped this mess from happening.     I am now 15$ shorter & terribly sad to admit that this album has only one undeniable quality: It makes ALL its predecessors scream genius, virtuosity & talent. This ain't no Dynamite, this ain't no Cowboy, no Synkronized... Nope.    Very rare are the artists that have actually been able to produce succesful, quality records after the epitaphic 'greatest hits' collection of their past successes. I am afraid there will never be a 'High Times' part 2.     'Pressure, it gets ya'. Nicely put JK, nicely put.
031603438X|5.0|This is the book of the season.  Should we be surprised?  The surprise, Keith implies (tongue in cheek) is that he remembers it all.  The surprise for me was the skill with which he has developed an authorial voice.  Of course, he's a creative artist, but a 3-minute song is different from a 550 page book.  Even though the book was written with the help of his old friend, James Fox, the voice comes across as pure, unadulterated Keith.<br /><br />Some snippets of the book have been publicly discussed, in particular his comments on Jagger, but they are incidental to the story.  The short shrift given to Bill Wyman is equally interesting and the praise lavished on Charlie Watts comes as no surprise.  Fundamentally, this is Keith's story, from his beginnings in a gritty London suburb to the final image of him in his Connecticut library.<br /><br />That life has always been about the music.  The drugs are a distant second; they helped (for a time) facilitate the music--not to inspire it, but to enable the long hours and the metering out of energy.  Sex is a distant third.  This is a book about a man, his musical aspirations, his idols, his struggles and his triumphs.  It combines rock-solid honesty with a sense of fundamental decency and intelligence.  Who knew that KR was a great reader?<br /><br />The book is long, but it is a joy to read.  The inside scoop on the source of the song titles and album titles, the Stones' methods of composition and technical details on such matters as open guitar tunings are the book's gems.  A friend of mine was married to a prominent rocker close to the Stones.  She told me that whatever you read in the tabloids about sex and drugs should be balanced by the realization that, first and foremost, it's always about the music.  That is the Stones' first and last obsession.  That comes through loudly and clearly in KR's autobiography.<br /><br />He is also, of course, a man of family and we meet his mum and dad, his children and his loves, but fundamentally this is a book about the sixties and seventies and some of its greatest music.<br /><br />Read and enjoy.bout the sixties and seventies and some of its greatest music.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Many of the reviews on here were very accurate.  This cooler performs very well and is reasonably priced.  I made one small mistake and placed the fan toward the case exhaust - blowing back into the case.  My CPU was hovering around 28C.  It was easy to move the fan to the back thereby causing it to blow toward the exhaust.  By correcting this I'm now seeing temperatures at 26C.    I avoided the water cooled options because many of the reviews suggested this was just as good, lower in price, and did not require stiff tubes that were hard to work with.

Since 1997, he has been based in the United States and to date he has composed the musical scores for over 50 feature films.<br /><br />The Music:<br /><br />The musical score for this film is very emotive and uplifting. It has a very unique and mystical feel as at points a very soft choir is used. On the other hand, it can give you that 'up and away' feeling as the wind instuments raise the tempo.<br /><br />This CD has a very nice mixture of songs (25 in all) that convey different feelings and emotions. The lengths of the tracks vary from as little as 45 seconds up to 6 minutes and 18 seconds. If you like well composed music with a lot of rich textue, you will surely enjoy this CD.

B002JVWRAO|3.0|SOME SPOILERS<br /><br />Going into Season 5 of Supernatural all the pieces so painstakingly gathered over the course of the first four seasons are finally--and enticingly--set in place. Sam is addicted to demon blood and has fulfilled Azazel's every hope for him by siding with Ruby over Dean and killing Lilith and, by that, unwittingly releasing Lucifer into the world for an Armageddon-like smackdown engineered by angels and demons alike. Dean, for his part, broke the first seal leading to the Apocalypse when he broke in Hell and has been told by the angels that he's now the only one who can stop it. The tension couldn't be greater. The foundations of the boys' relationship have been razed. Sam has a demon-blood addiction to fight and is apparently the vessel of choice for Lucifer himself, while Dean has angels breathing down his neck insisting that he step up and become the vessel of the archangel Michael, whatever that might mean for him and Sam. Once more, this time above all, Dean may yet have to save or kill Sam. The Devil is roaming free, ready to party. And the Earth and the lives of all the billions on it are now in the hands of the two guys whose mistakes started it all...<br /><br />Season 5 has its moments, but I think it ultimately threw away nearly all of the potential it started with. The Apocalypse itself seemed distant, a looming threat that never really gained much immediacy. Worse, the series finale--the end of a story arc developed over 5 seasons--was sadly anticlimactic. Let's just say you have to completely shut off your brain to find the canon solution to the problem remotely believable, especially when at least three other potential strategies with far more promise for defeating Lucifer are presented earlier in the season but dropped. I didn't go in with any great expectations, but I found myself cringing and laughing in disbelief at the the dialogue and absurdities of it all. Yet the episode was even in a meta moment smugly dismissive of anyfan who was dissatisfied with what Kripke gave them. Lucifer seemed content to do nothing truly significant through nearly the whole season. There were far too many comic episodes that not only weren't particularly funny, but didn't contribute a whit to the overall storyline. The angels were every bit as corrupt and conniving and heedless of humanity as the demons, and if I'd hoped the archangels would be more interesting than the rank and file I was sorely disappointed because they were even more whiny, with daddy issues. Even Heaven was treated as a Stepford parody of anything that would actually merit the name. (If there are no good guys, and heaven is just a bunch of memories that's really hardly any better than Hell, why does it matter anyway if Lucifer wins?)<br /><br />Then there are the glaring plot holes and inconsistencies and the ridiculous way certain points were retconned. It was as if the writers honestly gave up trying to give the story any coherency whatsoever with prior seasons. While in prior seasons unnecessary collateral damage (especially to possessed innocents) and Sam's demon blood addiction and ends-justifies-means morality were treated as BAD things, S5 pretty much threw out any such nice scruples. John and Mary Winchester weren't necessarily in love; they were forced together by cupids just to produce their sons. The Trickster that plagued Sam especially was--surprise, surprise!--the archangel Gabriel, incognito. Hellhounds can suddenly be sent after anyone, whether or not they've made a deal. (If demons could set hellhounds on people at their leisure, why don't they?) Dean's amulet, given to him by Sam so many years ago, is actually a God detector, except that the prophet Chuck is evidently God, so the God detector is evidently broken around the one it's supposed to detect and the storyline of Castiel's search for God is dropped like a hot potato.<br /><br />Most importantly, storyline after storyline about the brothers themselves was dropped or mangled. Sam's addiction storyline petered out and was finally abandoned. He doesn't seem, in the end, to have truly overcome any of the flaws or hangups that got him into this mess to begin with, and though the season gives lip service to Dean's depression and loss of faith in Sam, all of that is somehow suddenly all better with a little trust from Sam and comes to nothing; the status quo is restored and Dean's big lesson is that Sam is a big boy so Dean shouldn't get in his way. Dean was somehow an overbearing bully to Sam all of those years and forced Sam into Ruby's arms, though through the first four seasons we never saw anybody stop Sam from doing something Sam really put his mind to and we saw Dean deferring to Sam plenty of times. Not to mention that Sam's most critical choices regarding Ruby were made while Dean wasn't there to harass Sam about them in the first place. Dean was supposedly the only one who could stop the Apocalypse and, by saying yes to Michael, save the world from Lucifer, but suddenly he's told by Death that he's no longer part of the story and replaced as Michael's vessel by a bit character at the critical moment with absolutely no trouble. Sam totally ignores Dean when their plan goes south and Dean tries to convince him not to say Yes to Lucifer after all. In fact, even getting beat up by Lucifer in Sam's body makes no difference. Dean's ultimate contribution to stopping the Apocalypse is driving up the Impala so that Sam can see a little toy soldier stuck in the ashtray that somehow allows Sam to take control of an archangel...though Sam earlier in the series was powerless when possessed by small-timer like Meg and there is absolutely no precedent in canon for overcoming angelic possession, much less possession by the Devil himself. When Dean tries to interfere, neither of two archangels, both of which want to fight and have to see him as a nuisance, get rid of him or send him off to Timbuktu or simply set up some kind of forcefield to keep him out of the way?<br /><br />There are some good moments...mostly Dean ones. I really think this season cheated Sam in particular in the characterization department, but it did a number on Bobby and Castiel too. My suggestion? Enjoy it for what it's worth, but don't invest much in it.
B000BYA5G4|4.0|Instantly it became a favorite. A climatic, based on true-life Faustus tale. Left me thinking on it for days.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I researched several headset models after my razer barracuda's earpiece broke, including the megalodon, madcats triton, and corsair types. I ordered actually 2 of these, and continue to be impressed. The gui is user-friendly, the macros located on the left earpiece are very handy, the roller volume is so easy to use and find with your left hand, can run all day on a single charge. No problems or interference with my wireless network or the fact 2 headsets are running simultaneous within the same home office size room. The sound is impressive and exciting, have played CS-Source, HL2, GOW via LAN. In GOW it took some gain tweaking to kill the feedback, however that was a minor issue. A case would have been nice, however thats a rarity with any manufacture these days. The wireless range is as it says, have had mine 30 feet away with brick chimney and kitchen appliance obstacles, no problem.
B002T921DE|5.0|I was fortunate enough to have seen this concert live.  The DVD does a fantastic job both visually and musically.  The quality of the sound is as good as it gets.  You don't get to see George live in concert that often.  This is a great substitute.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Easily the best film surprise of 2010 for me was Scott Pilgrim. I knew nothing of it going in, never heard of the comic let alone read it, and knew only Cera and Schwartzman. Which is perfect, as this movie just blew me out of my seat from moment one and never let up.<br /><br />Pilgrim is one of the most successful hyper-modern films I've seen, in terms of its incredibly fast, bright visual sense, and quick cuts that linger just long enough to let your brain grasp what's there but not quite process it fully. It's how video game players see life, and that connection is played to the hilt here, with so many vid game tropes milked for all they're worth. Yet for me it all coalesced into a thrilling ride through the worlds of some extremely brilliant minds.<br /><br />Director Edgar Wright has created the new touchstone for meta-cinema here, to my eyes, and I'd love it if most films were this smart and sly and self-mocking. There's so much going on in this film it's hard to describe; suffice to say that there's a laugh a minute and at least two nice visual puns in the same time. There's a loving retro vibe that's both uber-ironic and heartfelt, and if you lived through the 80s and played some of the old arcade games, there'll be some nice quirky reminders for you tucked amongst the acton.<br /><br />There's also a couple of quick little nods to Seinfeld, its music as well as Larry David's rule for the show, mocked here by Schwartzman: \\"No hugging, no learning.\\" But this film takes Seinfeld's intellectual slapstick and ratchets it up at least a couple notches.<br /><br />I liked the script, and wish there'd been a movie this hip when I was a kid! Then again, we had a few...but nothing this non-stop cool yet geeked out at the same time. So many flicks aimed at a young market pander or are just plain cheese, but SP stays far above all of that, delivering its own reality for 110 minutes with nary a groan-worthy scene.<br /><br />To me this film felt as fresh on first viewing as did Fight Club and The Matrix in their day, high praise indeed.<br /><br />Cera takes his nerdy thang to its ultimate heights; I thought he was both convincing and funny here, as is everyone, Weathers and Schwartzman and Wong especially.<br /><br />The music is often excellent, not just a satire but a good tribute to emo and alt-rock cliches, on the quality level of Spinal Tap (more high praise). It didn't surprise me to hear that Beck wrote many of the tunes; they're that good. His version of Ramona at the end of the credits is well worth hearing a few times, very haunting like some of his fabulous Mutations album, and his punky romps are hilarious and also musically interesting, no mean feat.<br /><br />Plus which, grand slam, the blu-ray is exemplary, full of bloopers and various docs and music shorts and just way more than usual, and way better. This movie deserved a great BD package, and got it. The transfer is perfect, and the intensely saturated colors and wild angles and set-ups look gorgeous, as does Toronto. Can't wait to watch it again to see the no doubt many things I missed.<br /><br />All in all, a true work of art.<br /><br />If you haven't yet had the pleasure, and enjoy fast, sharp, smart films full of color and brio, Pilgrim will keep your brain plenty busy and plenty happy. This film was too bright for the average movie-goer (it semi-tanked in its first run), but I'd bet anything it'll be a major cult classic in years to come.eir day, high praise indeed.

B00454U1NS|4.0|I enjoyed rocking out to this album while driving through the blustery snowstorm today! This CD contains all of the hits as promised, and is thoroughly enjoyable. I found it to be refreshing; songs that aren't all so serious, but fun. It was a releif to hear Pink belt out \\"So What!\\" while sliding down the highway.<br /><br />This album is the perfect answer to those who enjoy Pink's hits, but do not know her less popular songs as well. There is an album or two that only has a couple songs that I enjoy. This CD stops me from having to skip songs on my drive, and just jam to her hits.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|this movie was awesome once it finally got to me....It was alot closer to the book than the first two movies. I still think it could have been longer though....I really like the Cullen family. The love story is great! Glad Stephenie Myers decided to write about her dreams....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great book- as always, Sparks delivers. I downloaded the kindle edition this morning. I need something to do as i'm stuck in my house due to a blizzard and 30 inches of snow! Well, i couldn't put the book down... finished it in one sitting. The flow of the story is seamless, and the ending is one i didn't see coming.  Beautifully written! As with all his other books, i cannot wait for the movie to come out. The books are ALWAYS better, but i just love to see how others interpret the story versus how i visualized it in my head.  I wonder who'll they'll get to play Katie and Alex?
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I Love love LOVED this book :) My fiance actually read this book first, during a two week training period over the summer (He's in the military) and as soon as he came home, he handed the book to me and told me \\"You have to read this, its really good.\\" and it was! I have a soft spot for military men and Logan is spectacular :)I recently heard that they are making this into a movie and filming in Louisiana. So excited if thats true!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Never in my whole reading career has a book taken me beyond watching the characters do what they do, and actully make me feel like a part of the stoy itself.  This trilogy takes you from reader to tribute within a couple of chapters.  I have never met anyone who has not liked this book, and if you're in for the reading expirience of your life, then pick up &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;  I can almost garrentee that you will love it.  Unless you're a fantasy hater who also hates action stories, you NEED to read the most amazing book known to man.    ~ Fantasy Lovers Unite!
B003CR9BYE|5.0|As a long-time listener of the Sid Mark radio program in Philly, I am very familiar with the Sinatra Bossa Nova material.  I'm also a Jazz radio host and a big Stan Getz fan.  And I think Tom Jobim is suberb.    I compiled my own Sinatra/Jobim \\"album\\" several years ago using the Complete Reprise Box.  When Concord's release came out, I re-sequenced mine to match that.    I'm happy!
B003YWUTKM|5.0|Today I received the album called Metallic Spheres with The Orb featuring David Gilmour. I was very glad to hear the good and creating music on this album. At the same time I immediately recognized the sound. It was like a déjà-vue. And when I had wondered for some minutes I remembered where I had heard this kind if music before.     Sir Paul McCartney has done three albums under the pseudonyme The Fireman. The first was issued in 1993 and was called Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest and the second one was released in 1998 and was called Rushes. There were no information on these albums about who played other then The Fireman. The Beatles fans knew from the beginning that it was Paul McCartney under diguise who had made those albums. The titles revealed that it was connected to The Beatles single from 1967 Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane in which Pauls sings \\"The Firemen rushes in...\\"    Two years ago he released a third album as The Fireman. But now he even wrote his real name on the sleeve. And also with whom he had done this album. And that was a man called Youth. And if you have heard those albums and the album Liverpool Sound Collage which he did with Youth as well in 2000 you hear the same sound which appears on Metallic Spheres. That made me glad and satisfied. David Gilmour who is on this album has also co-operated with Paul McCartney several times before.    So I will listen to this album over and over again reading a good book at the same time.

B0042RUMG4|5.0|Kanye done did it again. This album is beautiful. Kanye shows us that once again, as much as we don't like his ego, we have to appreciate his music. He has great featured artists and a new original sound in every track. He takes you through all sorts of emotions. Every song is top notch. Do yourself a favor and purchase this album. Put your dislike to Kanye aside, this is history in the making.
B002ZG981E|5.0|After the release of The Dark Knight, there was no questions concerning Christopher Nolan's directing abilities.  But following that blockbuster, Nolan made a masterpiece!  Inception is easily one of the best movies of 2010 if not all time!  The direction and cinematography are amazing and Leo diCaprio's performance is superb!  There is a great blend of solid action with psychological twists that will bend your mind and force you to think.  I would recommend this movie to absolutely anybody.  Just know, however, that you need to pay attention because at the end of the movie, you WILL want to watch it again and again.  As far as the Blu-ray combo goes, there are two Blu-ray discs.  The first disc offers the feature film in fantastic high definition and the second disc has all the special features.  Which includes a section on dreams and a comic of the prologue to Inception.  The third disc is just the standard DVD.  It only has the movie, there are no special features whatsoever; only the ability to change the language and to add subtitles.  This version also comes with a Digital Copy which can come in handy when you don't have the movie.  Overall, this is a spectacular movie for anyone who wants to see great action integrated superbly into a mind-bending story.  The two disc Blu-ray version is a great buy for anyone.  You get three discs (two blu-rays and the DVD) plus the digital copy on the go all for under $30.  This movie is a dream come true...or am I still sleeping?
B003PIUC02|5.0|I had already heard nothing but good things about this show, so I am not really surprised that I enjoy it so much. I haven't finished the entire season, but I'm far enough in to know that it's very entertaining. I love the fight choreography, the ridiculous way the blood sprays out reminds me of the old Chinese films that I like. The actors even do a good job. It's pretty impressive for being a TV series. Well, a pay-channel TV series, but still...it's awesome.     I will admit there's a bit more nudity in it than I thought there would be. A fair warning to you fellas out there, be prepared to see quite a few penises. I didn't think they could get away with showing that on Starz, but apparently they can. they have yet to show the nether regions of the women, so perhaps that area is still off limits.     But yes, the show delivers the testosterone trip I was looking for. I'm very happy I bought the Blu-Ray of this as well. The new TV I picked up, with my surround sound looks fantastic with this show.
B002VECM6S|5.0|this is based on a true story. while i will image parts of the move were tailored to be less offensive, the movie is great. My wife and i enjoyed it alot and hence we bought it. we rent a lot of movies, but only a handful get purchaed in our own collection. this is one of them. we also bought some as gifts for friends/family for Christmas 2010.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Let me start off by saying...I don't watch crime shows on TV hoping to view an extremely real story line or orthodox police methods. I watch for the entertainment of it. And this one is on the top of my list. The writing is witty. Nathan Fillion (Castle) is perfect in his dialogue and mannerisms. Not to mention, he's gorgeous (for the women out there.) I've seen better acting than what comes from \\"Beckett\\", who is his female detective muse. But, she's not terrible and her and \\"Castle\\" compliment their characters well. This has become one of my favorite shows! Enjoy
8172237480|5.0|The Zoya Factor is a hilarious feel-good book that centers around Zoya, Her Luckiness, who happens to bring good luck to the side she cheers for at a cricket match. Zoya tours with a young unproven Indian team to Australia where the Cricket World Cup is at stake. In an age where gym routines, training exercises and computerized analysis dominate sports, here is Zoya - the Indian cricketing good luck charm blessing the players before each match. Born in a country where cricket is practically a religion, you can see an innocuous little \\"power\\" like this can spiral out of control very quickly. This goofy setup is complemented with an assortment of equally goofy characters including the studly Nikhil Khoda, skipper of the Indian team, who doesn't believe in luck.    The story grabbed me right away. I could tell that it was authored by a creative ad exec type just from the flavor of the writing. There are lots of clever one-liners and pop culture references that add color to the story. I'm not the type who laughs out loud when they type \\"lol\\" in Google Chat (who is?) but I must admit that I was actually laughing out loud while flipping through this book more than a couple of times. In fact my only real negative comment is that there are way too many references that will be totally lost on someone who doesn't speak Hindi or hail from India (or the Indian subcontinent, at the very least). I can't really recommend this book to non-natives.    The book claims that it is \\"now to be a major motion picture\\". I honestly think this material is suited more for a sitcom since the book is somewhat episodic in nature. At any rate, if Ms. Chauhan is reading this, I implore her to retain the \\"Hinglish\\" nature of the book in the movie along with all the colorful language, since it gives the book a lot of character.     In summary, even though at times it felt a bit school-girly, I enjoyed this little adventure. If you made it so far and are wondering what the title of this review means,it is a reference from the book which translates to \\"This one is a bit toinnggg!\\". Just don't ask me what toinnggg means!
B003UGLCIA|5.0|There is a shot where the priests who have just entered the house are standing near the stairwell,the personal assistant in coming down the stairs and Ellen Burstyn and the maid are standing off to the side. A down angle shot that includes all of them. They all look up at once because of the horrible noise that comes from Linda Blair's room. They all look up because they are so shocked but on the DVD there's no sound for that quick moment.You don't hear what's causing their reaction.    Does anyone else have this defect on their DVD?

B00275EHJG|4.0|This wonderful film answers the important philosophical question what happens to toys once their children outgrow them.  The answer takes us on a grand adventure to a child care center, waste treatment facility and finally, to the house of a little girl who inherits the no longer needed toys.  Growing up never looked worse.  Probably best of the three Toy Story films, each of them with their own wholesome message.

B003DZX44I|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is my personal all-time favorite animated film. It has my favorite Disney heroine ever, the independent strong willed Belle, along with the complex Beast and a host of great supporting characters, some of the best songs ever in an animated musical (or maybe in any musical period), and is wildly entertaining, enchanting, and emotionally riveting from beginning to end. It's a classic romance tale beautiful, epic, and without a major flaw I can see.     Well the blu-ray transition is another homerun from Disney. It is unbelievably good. It's an enhancement which respects the original masterpiece and gives a whole new life to both previous fans and first time viewers with picture and sound quality unlike few blu-rays I have seen before. There are a lot of great extras including deleted scenes and a brand new documentary that lets you choose what path you want to take, quite unlike anything I've seen before.    If you have a blu-ray player you have to get this movie. And if you don't have a blu-ray player this is perhaps the movie you buy one for. It's that good.

B000ICLRIE|2.0|It's a great movie but this Director's Cut is missing the other 3 discs with all the special features. Apparently it's not Amazon's fault and they wouldn't exchange it for what I wanted.
B0018CMJSU|4.0|The restoration seems even darker; not in tone but in cinematography.  With the interiors you feel like you are inside a large black, velvety fedora.  Was the director trying to make a black and white movie, but knowing he was forced to use color?  Though the sequel (II) is probably the better movie, it misses the presence of Brando.  After one has watched The Godfather twenty times one starts asking what if, but never to analyze it to search for deeper meanings or underlining gems of subtlety that suddenly showcase in your mind some lofty idea in the story that caused the director to shoot the movie in a certain light.  Orson Welles wanted the role as the Godfather.  It would have worked, but  with likely completely different results.  He would have been swarthier, more sedentary, looking more like a capo than a businessman.  In any case The Godfather is one of those movies you can watch again and again.  It is thoroughly entertaining.  If they made it today, Jim Carrey would play Sonny, George Bush would play Fredo, Johnny Depp would be Clemenza, Leonardo DeCaprio would be Michael, Robert Duval would keep his role and of course the Godfather would be played by Angela Joli...or maybe not.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headset, the G930 wireless, is by far the most frustrating piece of computer equipment that I've ever used. Installation is a breeze (don't plug it in before you finish installing the software), but after that, it begins getting tedious. I've tried this on two computers, both with Windows 7 Home Premium. On each computer, it most often required a reboot after turning on the headset to get it to work. It doesn't seem to like having Skype open when I want to use it for Ventrilo, and it doesn't want to do much of anything with iTunes open. Perhaps the most frustrating part is, if no sound comes through it after about 10 minutes, it apparently goes into a power-saving mode and turns off. This is VERY problematic when talking to someone after a long lull on ventrilo. I don't understand why it would do this, and there's no note anywhere in the documentation that comes with it about this.    The saving grace of this headset is that, unlike the Creative SoundBlaster wireless World of Warcraft headset, this is built sturdy and is VERY comfortable on the head. The noise canceling is very good, the 7.1 simulated speakers sound great.    I'm weighing in my head whether it's worth the hassle of putting up with the first paragraph's problems for the benefits of the second, or whether I'd just be better off returning it. Hopefully, Logitech will be able to fix these problems. I'm pretty sure I'm going to keep it and hold out hope that they will.    EDIT: See comment section for a few points I've mellowed on in the time since I bought it. Added two stars because of it.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|If you liked the first BDS movie, you'll find this one as entertaining. The Saints are back! More mature, more prepared, deadlier! With a new side-kick, Romeo, the trio will blow you away while making you laugh you pants off. And Il Duce is close behind. Yes, there is a female lead. BUT! She is as bad-ass as the boys. No romance to ruin the action.<br />Again, it's an awesome movie. I totally recommend this, and the first one if you haven't seen it already.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|The movie is okay, nothing really great but if you're a Hugh Jackman fan, it's a must have for your movie collection.
030746363X|4.0|This book is a good choice for beginners, iron-heads, and health and fitness science geeks alike. Tim has a gift for cutting through the fat and getting to the meat and bones of an issue and then being able to disseminate practical information. The content is there and the writing style is fun. Tim is very open minded and virtually fearless (or perhaps just courageous) when it comes to exploring everything from strength gain to sexual health in the most in depth, hands on way possible. I've been studying health and fitness and cringing under the iron for a decade and a half and not a week has gone by in that time period in which I haven't spent at least 10 hours a week reading and researching in this field. If I learned something, I'm sure you can too.

B001UV4XHY|3.0|I really enjoyed not only the stories in the Harry Potter series but also the great talent and forethought that went into creating them.  Each book speaks to a different age group in terms it can understand and does so in a vocabulary that stretches the growing reader without boring the mature reader to death.  Syntax gradually becomes more complex with each book, and the social issues faced at each age are presented realistically if not in the context of reality.  The plot structure is respected, with a beginning, middle and end that show continuity and respect for the reader.  Up until now, each of the films has also respected the story teller's art and the fictional work itself.  By these criteria, however, this installment of the film series is a dismal failure.<br /><br />The public relations for the film suggest that two parts were \\"required\\" to adequately present the book, but I disagree.  Two parts were necessary to adequately squeeze every last possible penny out of the franchise, and it is painfully obvious.  Part of the film maker's job is to translate the words and pages and the narrative episodes of a written work into a visual work that captures the story in a meaningful way, keeping the story on track by editing episodes where appropriate.  That doesn't seem to have happened here.  What we have is a meaningless bridge from the previous story to the d&eacute;nouement, a bridge we really didn't need and one that seems purposeless. The viewer ends up feeling like he took one of the stairways at Hogwarts, and it redirected him to a floor he hadn't intended on going to!<br /><br />The present film is more of a picture piece than a work of fiction.  Those who enjoy glorious filmography and natural settings will be pleased with the work, as it is definitely eye candy in this respect.  CGI buffs will also receive what they have come to expect by way of special effects in this series.  Those who have come to expect the drama of growing up into adulthood will be very disappointed.  The adult responsibilities and relationships, the personal losses, and the expectations of individuals against the grander background of world events that the final book portrays is somewhat lacking here.  There's a big build up, but nothing really happens that needs to have been enlarged on to the extent of a full 2 ½ hour film.<br /><br />The young people have started on their search for the parts of Voldamort's soul stashed in various objects, but most of the film has them \\"camping out\\" in lovely locations while trying to come to some plan of action.  Quarrels ensue, separations result, true camaraderie wins out and everyone comes together again, but other than that, not very much happens that forwards the story.  We've already seen the tiny tent with the capacious interior, of which Hermione's purse is just another version.  We've already gotten used to the concept of invisibility; we know that magic can be deadly and wicked people do wicked things.  The story has no beginning, middle or end.  The film just seems to mark time.<br /><br />Anyone collecting the films will hardly miss this one if they choose to have only the second part..

Since it is highly unlikely I got two things with faulty HDMI slots I point to the cables which are both the same. Got different brand of HDMI cable and everything is working excellent now. You get what you pay for. And these two cables I got it alright. Two cables that lose its signal.

B0043GAZYS|1.0|I watched this movie with some people who had already seen it. For me, it was the first time and while I understood the basic premise, the movie was just not funny or engaging. Even my fellow movie watchers felt let down the second time around. It was a real struggle to watch to the end. Our theory is that Scott Pilgrim is a group-think movie. If you're watching it with people who are laughing then you might enjoy it more. But I kept asking questions like, \\"Seinfeld? Why are they doing a Seinfeld parody when nothing here reminds me of Seinfeld?\\" and \\"Wait, he's sleeping on a mattress on the floor with his gay roommate who is sleeping with two other gay guys on the same mattress at the same time and, and, and you're saying Scott is NOT himself gay? If he's not gay, then why is he in bed as 3 gay guys?\\" And \\"So how big *is* that mattress?\\"    In the end, we decided that it's a stream of consciousness movie that is best viewed with those who love it and are passing around a bottle of something intoxicating.
1576754227|3.0|From a Woman Business Coach's Point of View:<br /><br />Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy has some good solid advice about how to get more of the important things done without feeling overwhelmed. Some of his tips overlap and are made up of age-old advice, but it's still nice to have it all in a small volume.<br /><br />There are a few things that I see my business clients do that Tracy points out actually gets in the way of being productive. One is to set aside blocks of times for really complex tasks. I encourage my clients to put aside blocks of time for strategizing or handling management tasks, the things that only you can do that really need to be done when you're at your sharpest.<br /><br />Another one is the addiction we all have to things electronic. It's very difficult to repetitively interrupt yourself when you're trying to do a task that requires some perspective.  On top of that, when you're so close to the trees it's really difficult to see the forest. Your field of vision becomes narrower and you'll miss the \\"aha\\" moment of real insight.<br /><br />Pick up a used copy of the book to read and reference the next time you're \\"stuck\\" and you'd like a new perspective.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|To be honest, I hated but loved the book. I was extremely excited to read Mockingjay after I read Collins Catching Fire. The energy at the end of Catching Fire is awesome and you begin to speculate what happens next.    But I set my hopes a bit too high because I was dissappointed by the lack of ..... feeling. Katniss was different and was on the point of breaking. It was not the energy I felt in Catching Fire.    My only favorite parts were whenever she was with Peeta, because she seemed to be the Katniss Everdeen I came to know and enjoy. I  really liked Gale, but Katniss wasn't right without Peeta. The ending of the story was VERY sad and I cried. But I think that by adding an epilouge to the end of the story, Suzanne Collins left the readers feeling a bit happier.    All in all, it was a very good and dramatic book. It shows you that all books don't have to end with a happily ever after, cause real life isn't like that, you still have to live with your problems and deal with it.

B001VNB54A|1.0|Tom Hanks and HBO both boast that they're honoring our Pacific Theatre vets.  The film proves otherwise.  I've read both E.B. Sledge and Robert Leckie's books about the Marines in Pacific.  The books With the Old Breed and Strong Men Armed do not once go into the pornographic depictions delivered by Tom Hanks and HBO.  HBO totally missed the mark.  The film could have better honored the men by leaving out the raw sex scenes.  It could have also focused more on the goodness of the men inherent in this Greatest Generation instead of embellishing and exaggerating the minority few poor traits that may have existed.  This series will make you come away with less admiration for our vets than they deserve.  The licentiousness was completely inappropriate and took away from any good the film boasted that it delivered.  I recommend instead to read the books and stay away from this lackluster production.
B001EX81ZI|3.0|I ordered these to use instead of the nipples. I work and pump while at work and it wasnt very cost effective using a nipple for each bottle so these covers came in very handy. My only problem is when my mother is on the go with my baby, she cant use both the sealing disk and the nipple like with some other bottles.
B0042MDAL8|2.0|Got the movie for my Wife for christmas. After she popped it in, I was shocked that this is seriously no better then an upscaled DVD. The pixellation is awful, even seems to be using the same hexagon upscale algorithm our DVD player would use. The audio was fine, though was only 5.1 which is a little embarrassing for a modern blu-ray these days.    Just be advised if you purchase this to NOT expect Blu-Ray quality, this is at most an upscaled DVD.
0765326353|5.0|Sanderson is one of those rare authors who crafts interesting, multi-layered worlds, *and inhabits them with people we care deeply about. The words he writes are almost always in service to the story, not devices to display how clever he thinks he is. It's ironic that someone so economical with words required a thousand pages to introduce us to this series. Ironic and a very, very good thing.    Are there a few soft spots? Certainly. Predictable moments? Of course, life and people are often highly predictable. But surrounding these are vast sections of brilliance. How great writers like Sanderson, Rothfuss, etc. are able to do this is beyond me; it's literally like magic.     In my opinion, those most compelling character/plot-line was not Kaladin but Dalinar. His idealism, insecurities and interactions with both his family and Sadeas are riveting.    I'm hoping Sanderson will follow this up quickly, but don't to let potential gaps in the continuation of the series stop you from opening the door. You won't regret it.
0451228375|1.0|I must preface this by saying that I have not even read the book yet.  I got it for my husband who has started to have to pull things away from him to see clearly. I have perfect vision, but as soon as the book was delivered I was so annoyed that they didn't use a few extra pages and make the print a bit bigger..really I would have paid a couple of dollars more!! If you like reading at night when your eyes get sleepy, then you may be a bit annoyed at the size of the print.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|If you are a fan of Dexter like I am then the third season will not disappoint you.  I unfortuantly was unable to watch Dexter while it was on Showtime but this actually makes it better for me because I don't have to wait for the next episodes to air. The third season hits the ground running with Dexter soon to be a father. If that wasn't enough, the addition of Jimmy Smits to the cast as his new best friend and partner in murder was something I thought would never happen. Dexter breaking his code!!  All in all the season played out very well with Dexter having to match wits with his protege all the while preparing for a child and a wedding that he never Harry never imagined would happen for Dexter. Add in the developing story of Detetive Batista and the wild ride of a life that is his sister's Deb. This season in my opinion outshines the last two. Michael C. Hall almost makes you believe he is his character, add in the eye candy of Julie Benz and Lauren Velez and you have the makin's of a great show.
0307269760|5.0|Alice Munro is one of the few authors I have read who so artfully relates the throes of the human condition through her characters' active and reactive thoughts revolving around people with whom they are intimate and others whom they've simply met on their path through life. Having just devoured Too Much Happiness, Munro's book of short stories, I am reeling from the power of her words.<br /><br />I have the habit, when reading brilliant authors' works, of writing down certain passages that strike me with their eloquence or bite me with their awful truths.<br /><br />The following are several extracts, in italics, from the ten stories in Munro's newest book (short thoughts from me tagged on without italics). While reading these clips, as they flow down the page and with the characters' thoughts out of context, I'm hoping the effect will not be too strange. If you take your time with each, and I believe the protagonists' inner thoughts will grab hold of you like they did me so you'll be enticed to read Too Much Happiness, although I don't think you'll find too much happiness overflowing the pages.<br /><br />Love...if the great happiness--however temporary, however flimsy--of one person could come out of the great unhappiness of another. This thought had me questioning happiness altogether.<br /><br /> She was nearly crying with exhaustion and alarm and some familiar sort of seeping rage.  This is another line from another story where familiar paired with seeping rage caught hold of me, because of the sad fact that seeping rage would actually sound familiar and resonate globally.<br /><br />There is something I think you ought to know, said a mother to her daughter after her father's funeral. These may be among the most unpleasant words that person ever has to hear. There's a pretty good chance that whatever you ought to know will be burdensome, and that there will be a suggestion that other people have had to bear the burden, while you have been let off lightly, all this while.<br /><br />I began to understand that there were certain talkers--certain girls--whom people liked to listen to, not because of what they, the girls, had to say, but because of the delight they took in saying it. A delight in themselves, a shine on their faces, a conviction that whatever they were telling about was remarkable and that they themselves could not help but give pleasure.<br /><br />The worst was that her fingers had pressed my back. Through my coat, through my other clothing, her fingers like so many cold snouts.<br /><br />The yellow paint seemed to be the very color of insult, and the front door, being off center, added a touch of deformity. I playing with the color of verbs.<br /><br />But only adults would be so stupid as to believe she had no power. A power, moreover, that was specifically directed at me. I was the one she had her eye on. Or so I believed. As if we had an understanding between us that could not be described and was not to be disposed of. Something that clings, in the way of love, though on my side it felt absolutely like hate.<br /><br />When I first saw the look on Charlene's face I thought that her money had been stolen. But then I thought that such a calamity would not have made her look so transformed, the shock on her face so joyful. When you read this story, you'll be shocked that Charlene could be joyful doing what she did!<br /><br />From what I had said, Charlene seemed to have got the idea that Verna had actively harassed me. And I believed that was true, except that the harassment had been more subtle, more secret, than I had been able to describe. Now I let Charlene think as she liked because it was more exciting that way.<br /><br />Memories of childhood were much more distant and faded and unimportant than they seem today.<br /><br />He knew how much she valued me and now at the end of her life she seemed very keen to see me. She had asked him to get hold of me. It may be that childhood memories mean themost, he said. Childhood affections. Strength like no other. Yes, and the strength of childhood bonds are the mortar of memoir.<br /><br />He still tells her things--it's a habit--but he is so used to her now not paying any real attention that he hardly notices whether there is an answer or not. This time she echoes what he himself has said, \\"Never mind. You've got enough to do anyway.\\" That's what he would have expected, whether she was well or not. Missing the point. But isn't that what wives do--and husbands probably the same--around fifty percent of the time?<br /><br />I have never been so tempted to write romances, as when with Fat Maksim. And he takes up too much room, on the divan and in one's mind. It is simply impossible for me, in his presence, to think of anything but him.<br /><br />And at the end of his letter one terrible sentence--\\"If I loved you I would have written differently.\\"<br /><br />Always remember that when a man goes out of the room, he leaves everything in it behind, and when a woman goes out she carries everything that happened in the room along with her. It will serve me well to remember this pearl of wisdom.<br /><br />Which surely meant that he would consider she had some hold now, and would have felt it beneath his dignity to deceive her.<br /><br />He had to be careful about saying what he really believed--that there must be something like intuition in the first-rate mathematician's mind, some lightening flare to uncover what has been there all along.

I bought this originally back in 2007 on DVD and loved it so much that later, when I got a blu-ray player, it was one of the first blu-ray discs that I knew I had to have.  Both sound and picture are stunning.  You will not be disappointed.

Where do these directors and writers get this crap from? Unless you like sick, twisted movies, I do not recommend at all.

0786955570|5.0|Based on an Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Gothic horror adventure module from 1983 and it's offspring,  Castle Ravenloft is a cooperative dungeon crawl game, were the players either all win or all lose as they battle their way through the dungeon,  dealing with monsters and traps, attempting to complete the adventure requirements.  It is a moderately complex game, particularly for players who have never played a fantasy role playing game.  After playing a solo adventure and a group adventure, the game mechanics and rules are straight forward and easy to remember.  It is still a hard game to win.    Castle Ravenloft is a very large game with lots of pieces.  It comes with more than 40 unpainted miniatures as well as dozens more dungeon tiles, cards, tokens, etc.  There are more than a dozen adventures in the adventure book.  With the random dungeon creation and the various hero arraignments, it has great replay value.    The quality of the game seems first rate.  The dungeon tiles and tokens are made of thick cardboard.   Take care in punching the pieces out of their cardboard frames and they should last a long time.  The unpainted miniatures are made of plastic.  A few of the miniatures have bent weapons or other parts that should be straight.      The rules are spread across the rule book, the scenario book and the various game cards.  It takes a few plays to get the game play down.  If you don't know what a particular marking on a dungeon tile means, ignore it, as it most likely is explained/used in a later adventure.      This game seems to be designed for future expansion and customer content.  Following the pattern of the existing adventures, heroes, monsters and villains, it's fairly easy to create your own adventures.      If you find the rules too hard or too easy, modify them or create your own.  For example, we play with two house rules.   First, if two or more heroes flank a monster/villain, the flanking heroes get a +2 to their attack role.  Same rule applies if two or more monster/villains flank a hero.   Second, if you have not moved your maximum squares when uncovering a new tile, you can continue moving into that new tile until you use up your speed and possibly get the drop on a monster if you have not already used your attack.    This is a great dungeon crawl game without the time, preparation, and number of players required for a full D&D RPG adventure.  No dungeon master is required.      At $65 MSRP, the game is a little expensive, although, if you enjoy Dungeons and Dragons type games as well as miniatures, the game is well worth the price.  With the size and number of pieces required to play Castle Ravenloft, a large table is required.
B002W1HBN4|5.0|When the legendary Clive Davis signed Whitney Houston to his Arista label in 1983, he decided to turn her into a superstar from the very start. Davis spent well over a year auditioning and selecting songs for this all-important debut set (some say the album's budget was set at a then-eye-opening $250,000.00) and he paired Whitney with several then-hot producers (Narada Michael Walden, Jermaine Jackson, Michael Masser and Kashif) whose contributions would make the album appealing to both Urban R&B and Adult Contemporary audiences--and it worked out perfectly.  Not only did this album go on to become one of the 1980s greatest success stories--it also established Whitney Houston as one of the last great Black Music divas.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I'm a fan of the show, so of course I'm going to like this.  However, I didn't discover it until season three.  Season One is just as good, and unlike Seinfeld or Friends, this show hits the ground running.  Smart and witty, this is a damn good show.  It answers the question of what happens when a cute girl moves in next door to a bunch of dorks.  But you don't have to be a nerd to appreciate it (says the nerd writing this review), my wife is quite hip and is able to enjoy the universal humor.  Try it.  You'll like it.

B0041EVYVK|3.0|Received this for Christmas.    That's what Christmas is for - getting things you would not necessarily get for yourself.      I like Daniel Lanois, and was very curious about T. Whitley's vocals, having heard her do backing vocals on a few of her late father's songs.      As a whole, the album drones on a bit.  Some of the tracks are overly long, showing the need for tighter song craftmenship.     Admittedly, I'm not a fan of jam band - type music, so I'm predisposed against extended instrumentals.    Long, at times-generic-sounding-blues, or vaguely reggae sounding jams... meh.    The \\"tighter\\" songs on this record shine, and elevate my review from 2 to 3 stars.  Tracks 2,8 and 9 standout in my mind.    Vocals are great.  Even more so than I had hoped.     Individual musicians are all extremely talented.      The pieces are all there, but only really come together for me on maybe half the tracks.     Caveat - review based on my first listen. But my commute is a long one, and I got to listen in it's entirety.      Perhaps it'll grow on me.    2-1-11 -  Nope.  Hasn't grown on me much.  The songs I already liked when I initially reviewed this, are truly impressive after a dozen or so listenings, but not so much the album in it's entirety.

BB King + Ike & Tina<br />2. Original GYYYO<br />3. Encore set (new 5)<br />Then watch the DVD of the Encore set and check out the cool footage, extras<br />The Hard cover book is very nice as well.

B004FTSAMC|5.0|\\"A tour de force performance by Emily Deschanel as Temperance Brennan- and kudos to the writers of the episode that brings a long-awaited climax to the relationship between the two main characters. The whole focus is on Brennan as she seeks to put together the life and final moments of a gifted cardiovascular surgeon. She is guided by the voice of the dead woman herself dictating her office notes, and by the observations of a museum security guard. In the process, she is forced to confront some very painful truths about herself. It may be that I have too much Christmas on the brain, but it reminded me alot of Dickens' Christmas Carol - Temperance certainly is no Scrooge, but her emotional heart is certainly as heavily guarded as Scrooge's gold. Like Scrooge, Temperance has the only key to unlock it - no one else can do it for her. She has to work it through for herself. And - you have to give her credit, when she decides to turn the key - she does it with an honesty and courage only Temperance could produce. I am anxious to find out where the writers will take it from here.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|I got this set for my Toy Story-loving fiancee and he loves it!  We don't currently live together but it's great since he has a bluray player and I have a dvd player!  It's truly the best of both worlds - plus the digital copy is perfect for our iPad and iPhones!  Love it and highly recommend it for those big Toy Story fans out there.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Whilst most of this book is a reflection of his pre-stardom days, it is anything but boring. As well as describing his hard upbringing, decadent lifestyle as a musician and descent in to alcoholism, it also describes his desire and dream for a life in America and how he sought help and got himself onto a path of sobriety and citizenship.<br /><br />As an immigrant to the United States myself, I found this book to be an inspiration to me, as I go through the processes. The final chapter is a \\"must read\\", not just for prospective citizens, as he explains very well the feelings that (I imagine) most immigrants, even those of us, like Craig and I, who come here from other Western democracies, feel about our new home.<br /><br />In short, this book is an inspiration to the importance of hanging on to one's dreams, of seeking help when life takes a downwards turn and of the hope and rebirth a person can still find in the \\"American Dream\\".
B0041KKYEM|1.0|This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long while. The plot concerns itself with the cutthroat world of female ballet performers and follows a rather predictable set of formulas. We have the good girl (Portman) whose position is threatened by the bad girl (Kunis). We have the bad mother lurking in the background. Then we have the unleashing of the \\"dark\\" side of the good girl through competition which the good girl then struggles to control. Its all a set of very old cliches seen many times before.    There is a term in music, overproduced, that has bearing on this film. Darren Aronofsky \\"overproduces\\" the film in the sense that he puts heavy layers of technique and gimmick over everything. A little of what he is doing would be ok, but its layered so thick that it drags down the entire film. Too much playing with perspective. Too much layering in of dream sequences. Too much emotion. Too many tantrums. Too much of everything.     I don't think much of the cast either. I've never understood what people see in Natalie Portman as an actress. Her performance here is one-dimensional. She gives us a workaholic pushing toward a breakdown and a woman becoming a monster. But there is nothing special to what she does. Its a very predictable and ordinary performance with no particular edge to it. Mila Kunis does nothing interesting and mostly plays one of her stock characters. Vincent Cassel is too over-the-top to take seriously. Winona Ryder gives her best performance in a very long time, but the range is limited by the overwhelming emotional intensity that the film pushes all the time. Barbara Hershey brings no subtilty to speak of to her part.    The film plays with every cliche with regard to women in the book. But to make these chiches work today requires doing unexpected things with them or giving performances that do subtile things with them. But the film on every account is obvious and almost overbearing.     The film was a good idea in conception. But with theemotional intensity cranked to 11, all the cliches, all the dream sequences, the overproduced visuals and the bleak nature of the story, it fails. The good story here was in athletic and competitive nature of ballet. The good story would have been in an examination of why and how people push themselves to the very top. A good story would have been more in the real world. But it is what it is.     Combine \\"Showgirls\\" with \\"Single White Female\\", add in hallucinations ala David Cronenberg, ratchet up the emotional intensity to 11, add in weird perspectives and you get Black Swan. It will be highly praised for six months and then forgotten.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I wanted a camera bag that could grow w/ my camera/lens collection ... THIS BAG is the answer to all my needs :: PLENTY of space for various lenses, adjustable compartments and lots of pockets for all the \\"extra\\" stuff you may need.  I did A LOT of research before picking this particular bag ... comparing it to many \\"top name brands\\" and this one was the PERFECT pick for me.  Thank you, Amazon :)
0321647440|1.0|Although the book is good, it simply does not match the CD. Since all book lessons are based on the examples on the CD, I am completely lost and learning at a snail's pace. Do not buy this book unless you can learn without the CD support system.  I'd like to change my position. Don't buy this book. Chapters 2 and 3 are just as difficult to learn with or, in my case, without the CD. I find the book confusing and wish I could return it had I not opened the CD. This book is difficult to understand with or without the CD. Buyer be cautious.
0060594888|5.0|Great book ! I had gotten it from the library and liked it so much I had to buy my own copy.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Love the movie.  High Def blu-ray only makes it better.  Throw in a DVD and Digital copy for free is just sugar on top.  Stallone does a great job bringing multiple action stars into a pure testosterone driven old school action flick.  If you like any of the actors that are in the movie in action roles (or if you are a man), I guarantee that you will enjoy this movie.  Get it on sale...even better!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I like getting the 2-disc sets, because I actually enjoy the commentaries that play during the movie.  You learn some stuff about the movie you wouldn't find out anywhere else.  And I'm surprised, and glad, that Stephanie Meyer is in one of them.  It's nice to see her play a bigger part in her own franchise, other than being author of the books and as a consultant for the movies.
B00418NVMQ|4.0|I have the first Halestorm CD but when I heard the live version of a couple of songs on Octane I had to buy this album too.  A couple of new songs and great live versions.  Definitely worth the purchase.
072325804X|5.0|How could one go wrong with Beatrix Potter!  I purchased this copy as a gift for a great grandchild!   I have a copy of my own![[ASIN:072325804X Beatrix Potter The Complete Tales]]
B0044CE682|1.0|In the time this video took to start playing, I downloaded it on itunes instead, in HD and watched the episode. If your vod service is going to be this slow and useless, please at least price it accordingly. The five green dots of the loading never stopped, even when moving the player to low quality setting. I would ask for a refund, but I bought the episode from a $5 twitter credit (encouraging people to try it for free, I guess). Obviously that post has been deleted. Lesson learned, amazon vod still behind itunes, which for the same price is a no brainer.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The DVD set arrived shortly after ordering. Everything is in perfect shape!  Totally satisfied with the low price!  Thanks for the great gift.    We are loving having the opportunity to see the beginning of this show at our own leisure!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Spectacular book. If you've read The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks as well, you'll constantly find yourself remembering the tips and tricks you learned from the Guide and screaming at the characters when they make bad decisions and rooting for them when they make good ones. Also intriguing are the political aspects of the book and the depth that Brooks goes into the consequences of different country's decisions in the wake of the outbreak. If you like zombie fiction, this is a must read.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|We got this for our brother-in-law who is very interested in WWII. He does not have HBO so we got it for him for Xmas. We watched this series and were in awe each week at the end of the show. It depicts the war in a very realistic way and we were speechless every week. It also showed what life was like at home for the families. Excellent watching. Would recommend.
B0047T86G0|5.0|As a South African who grew up in London this will always be my gold standard.  Not sure why I was lucky but I slipped though a time window and ended up with it on my iPhone for free.  Now the Kindle version is not available in the USA.  Very glad to have it on my iPhone.
B0009P66TK|5.0|I knew I was buying a big watch and I only realized how big it was until I opened it.   I even thought of returning it but my wife said when she saw it \\"What a great watch! That is VERY trendy!\\" and my sister in law said the same thing. So I thought \\"What the heck, I'll give it a try\\" and wore it for the evening that day. Days later, the more I see it, the more I like it. Very classy and not common at all! I like it very much -and you can see the time across the bedroom!- Anyway. Great purchase, quick delivery and needless to say, I'm willing to buy another big one.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|This movie ROCKS.  I like Robert Downey and he did an awesome job as Sherlock Holmes.  Jude Law was exceptional as Watson.  Not a big fan of Guy Ritchie's work but he did an awesome job with this movie.  Can't wait for #2.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|After about 30 mins of setup this worked great.  My cheap Gateway mouse and $10 usb keyboard from KMART and it worked as advertised.  If you want to use a mouse and keyboard to play games on PS3 this is the right product.
