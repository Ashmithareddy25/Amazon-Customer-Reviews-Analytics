B000JMKTLO|4.0|So far, this is probably my favorite of the 3 Gillian Flynn books. It is SO screwed up, really. I thought I had guessed what happened spot on, but boy was I shocked. It actually horrified me. Flynn definitely keeps you on your toes. I think I gave it a four instead of five just because of how twisted the book was. However, I am looking forward to whatever her next book may be.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This was my book club selection; however, I found it rather boring and did not like the ending.  There are so many books out there that would have been better choices.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Very inspirational! I knew there had to be a better way to raise a child and this was it for me! This book teaches so many valuable parenting skills, I am using it as an instruction manual although it is not so much in instruction-manual format as it is story format. She gives a brief intro to each value, then goes into stories and examples of what she had experienced or seen.<br />It teaches how we don't need to give up our whole lives as parents to be GREAT parents, that we can go out to eat and actually ENJOY the meal together, knowing the difference between teachable moments, listening moments, allowing small acts of naughtiness, and just plain unnecessary micromanaging (!!), and so much more!<br />Going to also purchase her &#34;Bebe Day By Day&#34; and look for cook books that specifically emphasize the French values of introducing foods to your children. I NEVER made separate meals for my daughter, always had her eating what we did (and at 3 she eats tons of fresh veggies and fruits), but this book is inspiring me to find more interesting ways to do it :)
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I was a good deal. Only liked one song on it till I listen for awhile. Now I love the whole thing.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Well written;  gripping story;  couldn't put it down<br />showed how characters changed as they became closer<br />good analysis of families involved as well
B006GECE9Y|3.0|Yea its better than firefox on mobile. But mobile is the key word. So far I haven't been able to get a normal web page view like you would on a PC. Mobile is limited, extremely limited.
0805095535|2.0|I guess, in the main, I didn't care for the 'daily journal' format, finkdng it uninteresting a droll at points.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game and easy to use. I personally find it quite addictive because I am always trying to beat my highest score. I also have this game on my phone for those moments when your waiting for someone whilst sitting in the car. Beware I find time goes by quite quickly when I start playing this game.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Really good movie, even for Cruise. Special effects are really good, highly recommended, the twist will surprise you and make you go Hmmm?
B00915G6WQ|5.0|As Always, the Series keeps one wanting more and more<br />Sad to see only one more Season left, but its been a killer run.....
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is the best series ever! Blue ray only makes it better. Things you may have missed before while watching are brought to the forefront in this format.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I've watched this series three times and enjoyed it each time. The attention to detail is amazing....the acting is wonderful and the story line is completely believable.  Highly recommended.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Dislike the trying to force buy of items &amp; commercials to pop in. Will quit game if commercials continue. Will not buy from companies doing it. Like to earn the items instead of buying with real cash. Chests should be more help not spending more for less.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|I've had the first two Mika CD's for years and loved them. When I saw he had a new album out, I had to snatch it. And what a fantastic album it is! I like to say that we went through a &#34;Mika Craze&#34; this summer at my house. I listened to the album, and loved it. Then I shared it with my family. My dad loved it, my mom had it stuck in her head, my sister grabbed it too...at one point, you could walk into any area of our house and hear it playing. My room, my sister's room, the living room while my mom cooked in the kitchen, the garage where my dad was working. It was crazy. It was a Mika Craze. As we were listening to the first track at one point, &#34;Origin of Love&#34; my dad simply stated, &#34;I think this song is just...awesome&#34;. And generally, my dad doesn't even listen to this type of music, so there you go.<br />I've listened to this over and over, and still can't stop!
0440246016|4.0|I am a die-hard Reacher fan, but this book did not propel me to read into the wee hours of the morning as a Lee Child novel usually does.<br /><br />The storyline is classic Lee Child and well executed.  The dialogue is crisp, spare, to the point. The descriptions of physical surroundings are focused toward the story, not used as filler. The numerical and time references play well into the storyline and tie the actions of all characters together masterfully. And the conclusion was both realistic and satisfying. But, it felt as if the cerebral / physical balance of the story was off, somehow.<br /><br />Perhaps it was because the author has Reacher, for the first time in over 10 years, question his choice of life-style. Reacher questions his appearance and he questions his physical and mental acuity. He wonders if he just appears to be a loser to his former special investigative team members or if he really is a loser.<br /><br />I have always questioned the author's literary reasoning associated with Reacher's appearance and his lack of even a single bag of toiletries and a single change of clothes. It just doesn't feel realistic, not mentally and not monetarily. But to support this device, Lee Child always has Reacher explain to the reader in each novel why he travels light and looks like a bum.<br /><br />However, the explanation just doesn't jive with the reality and the circumstances of this storyline. For instance, in this book, the imbalance between appearance and circumstance becomes strikingly prominent as early as page 5. And, quite frankly, I had a hard time understanding how certain events could have actually taken place with Reacher looking the way in which he was described.<br /><br />As is often said, \\"The devil is in the details,\\" and my suspension of disbelief just wouldn't kick in this time.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I gravitate toward anything by David Baldacci. This one was my first of this series and it was not a disappointment. I am eager to follow the characters further. I have not ever watched the television series; maybe I don't want to now.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Young or old.... this is a must have. We listen to the CD almost every time we are driving and we downloaded all the lyrics to sing along.
B0063GORYU|1.0|I find it very annoying to have to delete the advertisements between each game.Is there a way to get rid of these ads
B00DNDR29I|3.0|ArchAndroid was better, IMO. Surprisingly disappointed with this one. There are a few songs that grabbed me immediately (Give Em What They Love, Q.U.E.E.N), and others that initially seemed appealing, but ended up being simply derivative (Ghetto Woman, Dorothy Dandridge Eyes). With so many collaborations early on, it takes a while before you get a sense of Ms. Monae's self & expression. And the \\"future radio\\" interludes were distracting and superfluous, killing the flow of the project. As usual, it's a double album with only about one disc's worth of killer, and one disc's worth of filler. It could have used a round or two more of deciding which songs to cut.
B00CD36FF6|5.0|He uses simple tests on groups of people to gain an understanding of how they tick. This book is very Interesting.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|kids have watched the movie over and over and over so there was no problem with the disc. The shipping package was good too. Not any hassel getting it open. The cover on the movie was in reat shape too. Loved it all!!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|While I bought this item for a gift - I got really excited seeing the package! Brought me right back to being a kid! The box was slightly dinged in the corner but a true fan like I am did not care!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is like temple run but it's better loads of u guys should play it lol I love it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great summer read, takes you to another place and time and then back again. The sacrifices and choices made in life mold us into the people we become.
B009RX85N0|5.0|I missed a lot of the episodes when it was on TV, so it was great to catch up with the DVDs.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Just wish at level 17 there were more quest to do and when it says 24 hours when you start one it actually waits the 24 hours before it ends
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I really enjoyed the first book and I rarely like the second better than the first but thus one was amazing. I loved the suspense and drama, without it being overly dramatic. It's an easy read and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the hunger games.
B000JCSPG0|4.0|Great sci-fi watch.  Movies like this and the inspiration that come form it and hard to come by now a days
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Very good c.d...music is very unique..you get a little jazz, rock, r&b,etc...will buy newest c.d in the very near future
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A nice development of the characters with a twist at the end. The accent was difficult to follow at first but by the end of the book I felt as though I was speaking along with them.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|like maggie smith a lot but this fell a little short of her acting ability. seems like something was missing that you keep looking for, then it was over.
1402543689|5.0|I love all books from the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series.  This one, like the others, did not disappoint.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Everyone should read the books and see the movie.  It is AWESOME!!!  I can't wait for the other movies to be made.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|This is a great series and they take you on a great adventure through all of the books. They are a must read for any age that likes to get lost in adventures!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My Son loves it and can't let it go, he always has this one or the Giraffe Wubbanub. He has his binki and stuffed animal in one.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|Great little time waster. If you like Tetris, you will love this. Definitely worth the purchase price, I am glad I grabbed it as the FAOTD. Small kids probably wouldn't like this, not a lot of bells, whistles, or complicated moves to make. Great game for someone raised on Atari and the original NES.
630460288X|5.0|If you like to watch Sylvester Stallone movies then this is a movie that you people should go and watch.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|want more, can't wait for the new season, way too involved in their lives. Great period pieceI feel like I'm evesdropping on.
B00006JDU9|5.0|If your a really big fan of the Star Wars movies then you will like this one as well as the other ones.
0143124544|5.0|Has been a long time since I have read a book that grabbed me like this one. A great read!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very enjoyable game that you can play for long periods of time. Many levels that keep you entertained.  Great for all ages.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book really drags you in. It is very clever with unexpected twists and turns. The audio book from audible is also very good.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|I must confess that I have only come lately to appreciate the artistry of Guy Clark.  Before downloading this CD(and several others)I knew his songs only through the able interpretations of singers such as Jerry Jeff Walker, Mickey Clark, Jimmy Buffet, and Willie Nelson.  That led me to check out the music straight from the man himself. Now I appreciate the artist.  Guy Clark can wrap words around music and paint a sonic picture of feelings that reflect the inner soul.  Mr. Clark is a Highway Man at heart and his Texas soul shines as bright as a Luckenbach moon.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I wasn't sure I would want to completely read this story once past the 6th chapter, but I am glad I did and read the entire Trilogy.  There was a plot and great story line.  Each book left you wanting more.  I was very happy with the ending and the pulling together of all the components of the story.  It was great!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Good game and easy to play. Very simple for all ages.<br />I am pleased with the purchase of this game.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|It was fast reading 8th grade level, but true to life...did not affect my life path...good murder stories all of his work is.  Redundant but, when you have a series you must repeat a few things.<br /><br />Sumner
0812986180|4.0|Much less dramatic than the TV show but probably more reflective of the quiet, WASP-y author.  Still, I enjoyed it very much as it illustrates the insane way the federal Bureau of Prisons creates a population of people unable to cope with the real world once their prison sentences end.  Much reform is needed and the tie-in contains references of where to get more information.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have never played it but my 10 year old loves it. He says it's similar to the old Jaws Unleashed on the original xbox, but better.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This series is more about the 'human condition' than it is about zombies. Zombies just represent the challenge. It is interesting to watch how the writer/s approach this horrific situation. Everyone handles the situation differently. One thing remains the same. The majority look for leadership. No one wants the job cause no one wants responsibility just in case they make a mistake and they do not want to be blamed for it. So someone bold and brave steps up to to plate. Very interesting. I just watched on old black and white movie on TCM called Abandon Ship staring Tyrone Powers. Excellent movie! It addresses the very same issue that TWD does. TWD also satisfies those who enjoy watching how people react with a 'challenge' that is too unbelievable for the mind to conceive. We know that nothing exist to transform people who die into brain dead flesh eaters, or is there?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm a fan of tetris, so this is a fun twist on a puzzle game. Just started playing, and only made it through 5 and 6 so far.
0345529057|5.0|Just what i wanted...the complete set assorted accordingly in a very simple but good looking frame. Would deff recommend it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I am enamored with the characters and the mixture of drama and comedy. Huge 2 thumbs up for this show. I'm officially addicted.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie.  It was fun.  There was a little mystical element to the story that I found strange that didn't quite ring true to me.  When it got to the big reveal, I felt that it kind of tricked the audience.  By that I mean, looking back you could see where a certain character tricked the other characters, and you go ah-hah, I see that now.  But, it felt like some of the tricks were only aimed at the viewer and didn't involve other characters, so that's not fair play in story telling.  But overall, I would recommend this movie.
1454704225|5.0|fun to read  very easy directions to follow, simple recipes for drawing .... a must have for the casual doodler
B000T433CO|5.0|If you don't LOVE this movie and it doesn't touch your heart, then you need to go find where you left your heart. Do your heart a favor and buy this for your collection.
0425263916|5.0|I read it three times and still can't get enough. Silvia Day is a genius, truly gifted in her craft.
B00F35B8F8|2.0|Im a fan of the older Star Trek series but I kept an open mind when watching the first J.J. abrams movie and enjoyed (ended up buying it). Unfortunately, this movie throws all logic out the window... i guess just to see how far the director can go before making everyone hate it. Dont want to spoil it for anyone but lets just say its a pretty straight forward and predictable plot without much character development. Good if you just want a popcorn action flick.
0425263908|5.0|I wasn't sure how I felt about the book when I first heard about it, However my opinion quickly solidified to one of completely and utterly amazed. These two characters are similar to ones we all know very well, however they are very much different. The similar pain of both their childhoods makes them both vulnerable and drawn to each other like moths to a flame. I wonder who will burn who first.
1451613512|5.0|Everyone should read this book.The real USA the good guys my ass.Wave the flag you have no idea the greatest country? spoon fed propaganda We are the EVIL EMPIRE.The truth can be painfull.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Great season, definitely excited to start season 2. Keep up the good work! Hope to see many more seasons in the future!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|The first few seasons of this series seemed to have a weak start, but the intensity ramps up (especially between Will and Alicia) and gets better towards the end.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This Game raw to be for the Kindle.... I thought it was go be decent, but it turned out to be better than I thought....<br />Jo.V
B007FIY3VW|5.0|It is very helpful and is eaiser to carry around a kindle than a laptop at times. Great for budgets and quick notes
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This at is on point with the style of note taking. It is also good to study off of because you can read the handwriting lol
B004T4LUPW|5.0|haveing my calendar with me in the kindle is a very usefull way to keep my schedule and it keeps me on track
1844137864|5.0|This was purchased as a present for my freshman college son, who had seen it in the bookstore during visits. I should say that he does already have familiarity with Banksy's work. He loves it. It's well made, very sturdy, nice binding (hardcover bought). Had terrific pictures and graphics. Lot's of captioning, some longer writing about pieces, periods, etc. Very dense, perfect for browsing thru bits at a time. And it's a real conversation piece in the dorm, helping to strike up conversations with other people who are interested in Banksy, art, street culture, you name it. Plus, my son isn't normally too interested in visual art, but here he is appreciating the medium in a very subversive way - that sneaky Banksy!
B0063M22QO|5.0|this game is fun to play and great way to exercise your brain. Makes you think and look closely at what you think you are seeing.
0321928482|5.0|I have found that the Adobe Classroom in a Book series is the very best way to introduce myself to new Adobe software or updated Adobe software containing major changes. It is almost as good as being in the classroom with an instructor looking over your shoulder.The training CD that is included with the software contains the same images that the book is using to demonstrate what the book is trying to teach. This method of training works very well for me when I do not have access to a campus classroom. This is the first book I look for when there is an Adobe software release.
B002Z8LPZ4|4.0|A little hokie but entertaining. Had suspense and some surprises at the end which are always appreciated.<br />Worth the watch.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|1997 Movie with a very young Matt Damon and Danny DeVito. Action packed comedy about a young attorney who has the case of his life.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product.  WE use it to get Netflix on a non-smart TV in our bedroom.  Casting movies from other streaming sites is ok, yet from what little testing I've done the quality has been bad.  Yet I don't care because I spent $35 to get Netflix on our bedroom TV....
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|I barely got through the first 35 minutes. After hearing the &#34;n&#34; word too many times to count and my adult son telling me the end was as bad as the beginning, I never finished watching it. I can think of better ways to spend $5.99. I gave it 2 stars becauseI I am feeling generous!
B009IRVSVQ|2.0|The seller stated that the CD was new and factory sealed.  Not true!  The CD came wrapped in a thin cellophane wrap and not sealed like CD's that are purchased in stores. This was the second CD that I ordered that stated new and factory sealed.  There is one song that has profanity, had I know that I would not have ordered this CD.
B00D6QUJ6U|4.0|I had the DVD that I lent to a friend and never got back so I ended up purchasing the BluRay.  The quality is about the same so if you can save a few bucks by buying the DVD I'd do it.  Either way, great concert!
B005EVVESM|5.0|The seller stated that the CD was new and factory sealed.  Not true!  The CD came wrapped in a thin cellophane wrap and not sealed like CD's that are purchased in stores.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really love this game. It is refreshing and calming. Love the music, would like a choice on what we listen to though so I could change it up sometimes. I'm on level 28 and there has been a glitch, but that's okay. It's just hard for me to pick a new name. I've started over several times and its no big deal. I don't mind starting over. People it's just a game. It's free and you don't HAVE to buy anything, it's your choice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of the best game ever and I am 28 and saying that<br />So gather the family around and play this game
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|Some of the disks were bad!  The complete second disk of year one was the same as the first disk, just mislabeled.  There were bad sections to every year of the series.  This was very frustrating!!!
9889979942|3.0|Much more is needed to describe the diversity of the Chinese population and their subcultures. The book is too small, too heavy, and lack of description.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book got me so excited that I couldn't put it down!  So glad that there are 8 in the series!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is very intuitive and user-friendly. I enjoy not only the broad range of sounds, but the binaural beats are a great addition that I use often. This app also lets you run more than 3 sounds at a time. Highly recommend this app.
B00DY951RQ|4.0|My bootleg of the Isle of Wight show has finally been obsoleted. The Band and Bob present an interesting new arrangement of each of those songs.<br />Also, for years I had been wanting to hear the rest of the songs from the New Morning time period.<br /><br />Yay, BOB.
B000SE0OYA|4.0|its works  about all there is to say!  But also all that is required for it to be a good purchase
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A fun game especially for horse lovers.  Great graphics and lots to do. Love that it is safe without violence. Highly recommend.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I have always Creedence Clearwater Revival, ever since I was a young teenager. I loved the country mix of sounds, the upbeat songs and the fascinating lyrics. I have most of their cd's.<br /><br />This one is no different for me, It is wonderful and fabulous. I hope that he never stops recording, he would be sorely missed if he did.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was so good. Worth reading. I could not put it down. I highly recommend it. I really enjoyed the escape from reality it provided.
0738212415|5.0|So glad I selected this book! The step-by-step directions gave me the confidence to create drawings I wouldn't have otherwise attempted.  Chapter end bonus challenges reinforce what you learn and encourage you to try something a little more difficult. It took me a little over two months to complete every lesson by drawing 30-60 minutes per day and I wish there was a second book. Drawings look refined, not sketchy or cartoonish. Didn't appreciate this until I started looking for a new book. Highly recommend for beginners or anyone returning to art after a long break.
0451419243|1.0|I have read and liked all of Ken Follett's previous novels and looked forward to this one, especially after enjoying 'Fall of Giants' so much.<br /><br />So sad. While the first book of this trilogy gave me a good understanding of the causes and development of World War I, this one was more like a poorly researched capsule outline of a momentous period in world history. I kept wondering if someone else, perhaps a wannabe beginner writer or a burned out hack had been hired to write the book for him. It was superficial. It was opinionated and pedantic and often unbelievable. It might give a developing writer a real understanding of the idea of 'Deus Ex Machina.'<br /><br />The slang was sloppy as well, for example, many years ago I was a 'white hat' in the navy, not a 'round hat.'<br /><br />This one did not have the maturity level of a 'young adult' novel. The shallow, unrealistic sex scenes seemed like pre-adolescent fantasies.<br /><br />One positive note. I did get a somewhat different and in some ways more enlightening view of the Spanish Civil War.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Dave Grohl hits it out of the park with this effort! It's a marvelous journey through a place that was the cradle of so much music history. The people and artists add a phenomenal heart to it all. I can't give this any more stars or I would.
B000050XEI|5.0|Again, Enya has made a beautiful CD music disk. I really love listening to her Cd's as they are so soothing and wonderful to listen to.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS. JUST TOP NOTCH. I MUST SHARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Another Lee Child book. Fast paced and enjoyable.Same format as most of the Reacher books ,but that is what I like about them.<br /><br />I recommend the book.
0767811070|5.0|WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS. JUST TOP NOTCH. I MUST SHARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
B003JQLHY0|5.0|The service was great and represented the product well.  Easy to read dial was a plus for me.  Seiko quality to boot and priced well too.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS. JUST TOP NOTCH. I MUST SHARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great place to obtain and share ideas. Recommended for any creative mind! Warning extremely addictive! I am on Pinterest everyday looking for recipes to try or decorating ideas for Holidays. Check out my boards if you wish, I repin often. Username is tcat82 !
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Intuitive and it even works like an alarm clock,<br />elegant and simple.  It wakes you up on time and that makes for a nice day.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|There's enough challenge to keep it from being boring but not too much to keep it from being easy entertainment.
B00CF9P5EA|4.0|As a book review I did a few years back infers, I collect ribald LP jackets. So, it 's the vinyl I bought of this. As an added bonus I like the music too. I have occasionally appreciated Oasis, and more often haven't. Liam Gallagher has created some listenable music in this LP. I think the Beatles influence is still pervasive and that helps. It's the harder edged Beatles that is represented here- - -Lennon's I Want You and Paul's Helter Skelter for example. Still it could be an Oasis LP so it's really for Oasis fans.<br />And the jacket is a good addition to the collection.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Great book. Brings back memories. Got it for my son who is in high school and reading suspense books. He's not putting it down either
B00DW39B2K|2.0|Seldom can two people carry an entire movie and this is an example that proves the point.  John Travolta's accent seems like it comes out of a &#34;B&#34; rated TV show as does the hair that seems to be painted on.  Travolta would have benefited by passing on this role.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|In the same way that Shakespeare has been successfully restaged in unlikely settings, &#34;Elementary&#34; gives us Sherlock Holmes in contemporary NYC with Homes as a recovering addict and a female Watson who acts as his sobriety companion.  (The underlying potential romantic tension between the two adds an element of suspense.)  Conan Doyle purists might object, but for those who love mysteries, this is a very enjoyable series.
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|loved it, haven't heard this album in years, and is one of the best. with the line up of band members it could not fail
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|This was perhaps the biggest disappointment I've ever loaded to my Droid X.  It promises smoother functions, more memory and simpler user interfaces.  Initially it worked great for about a week.  After that, it started acting very buggy.<br /><br />Before loading it, the phone and all the apps worked.  Some were slower than others but they all worked without glitches.  After installing this (advertised on the Amazon App Store as compatible for my phone), some of my applications would randomly stop or start up.  Two weeks in, I received a warning message from Google, that someone in China had tried to hack my account through my mobile device.  I immediately suspected this software and checked the time stamp of the attempted hack and the last use of this app.  They matched.<br /><br />Almost immediately after uninstalling the software/app, the phone stopped working correctly.  The unit would glitch on start-up and within minutes the screen would go blank.  Think of the \\"blue screen of death\\" in a Windows environment or an infinite 'do-loop\\" from the DOS days.  After multiple attempts to get the phone to work, I finally had called my carrier's customer service on my wife's identical phone in order to do a hard reset of the phone (ie, I lost all my data, calls, txt history... everything).<br /><br />After a full reset, my phone worked fine.  No glitches or anomalies.  Once the hard reboot was completed, I have slowly re-added most of the apps I had before.  With each add, none have duplicated the glitch.  I must it associate to this application.<br /><br />I would not recommend this software to anyone.  I recommended to Amazon that this product be pulls, but much to my surprise, it's still out there and still potentially being used to hack or infect devices.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|It doesn't matter if you are a kid or in your 90's, this movie is a classic and is always funny!
B002SRQ214|5.0|Perfect for the basic budget pc built for my grandparents. It runs everything very snappy and is a great value. Paired with a nice budget gigabyte motherboard, this made one great cheap pc.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Pretty fun little puzzle game. Does get annoying having to wait for an energy recharge though. Wish it was easier to zoom in.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|Arrived just as expected we have already watched it and enjoyed it just as much the second time as we did the first.
B0000039QA|5.0|I like the album it's pretty nice. I never bought it when it first came out. but it's pretty good.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I've tried a few other ambiance creators and in this one I have complete control and so many options, and its FREE!!
B008K7RGA2|2.0|I've seen several  Tosca performances and though Angela Gheorghiu was amazing, I expected  more from Jonas  Kaufmann's wonderful voice.  His  Recondita armonia  nor E lucevan..  did not make my heart go pitter patter (Ah any of the Three Tenors), )  and Bryn Terfel, one of  my very favorites, made Scarpia into too much of a caricature.  He looked as though he forgot to take off his Wotan wig and all that eye rolling did nothing to add to the role.  If this is  how the stage director Jonathan Kent visualized  Scarpia  he needs to go back to square one.  Scarpia  is evil but he is not a slob as he has been portrayed in some recent  performances.  He is elegant, grim  and his  evilness oozes from the music and  his singing. Personally, he is my favorite villain and I have  yet to see someone top Juan Pons  in the role.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I was familiar with parts of the storyline, but was eager to read the full story so I could thread all the pieces together.  It left me with a hunger to read more novels written by the Bronte sisters.  I got the immersion reading with this classic and enjoyed it all the better.  The voice talent was pleasant to listen to (which isn't always the case).
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I love nearly every song on this cd. Great songs and messages as well. Something I can blast in my car.
0307352153|5.0|This book provides an evidence-based counter message which balances what one usually hears in the culture.  Very readable, and provides food for thought in terms of the  methods/styles that introverts and contribute to the interaction.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|If you liked The Killing, you'll really like this, enjoy. The BBC channel is one of my favorite channels now.
0937381888|5.0|This is a great book to have when first starting out brewing. Gave this to my friend and they absolutely love how this book goes over the different types of malts and barley, as well as tips on how to get started brewing.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|Does just what I wanted, definitely worth a look since it's free. Allows you to download podcasts directly to your phone/tablet and listen on the go.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|It was all there the battles , The love and the hate! What more could you ask for.....Well a hope that they spin a series out of this dealing with Julius Caeser. Great , Great show.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The kindle app has spared me the back pain I used to suffer while carrying manuscripts around in my backpack. Paper is heavy, electrons are light. I now read more than ever before thanks to e-books.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I haven't had it very long, but so far I think it is fabulous.  I can see me using it for a long time.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Learned it at some friends house and loved it so much that we decided to get it for ourselves.  It has nothing to do with love letters, but the game is a blast.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I like bruce willis, I have seen most of his movies but I only have a couple, I am thinking of starting a collection, this one is one of his best movies, I highly recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|bound to become a cult classic.  It's a shame the season ended.  can't get enough of it...and I will watch it over and over.
B00448SE4S|5.0|I watched this movie at the theater and I loved It, it is a great movie to watch if you are a fan of old style video games.  I highly recommend it.
0385523394|4.0|This is a well written book that helped me learn a lot about the US prison system.  However, it is nothing like the Netflix series, so if you're expecting a funny, snappy, fast-paced book you may be disappointed.<br /><br />Although the people described in this book are interesting, the author either can't or doesn't share very many details about them.  And, unlike in the Netflix series, there are no \\"flashbacks\\" to the scene of the crime or descriptions of their lives on \\"the outside\\".<br /><br />However, if you are interested in learning more about prison, this book will help you do so.  Just don't expect any juicy details or too much intrigue.  This book is less like a soap opera and more like a long letter to the editor about the social and political implications of our criminal justice system.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|So enjoyed this novel. A light and cheery read with beautiful nuances and such clever humour.<br />A terrific holiday read.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|The book was very interesting. The narration is superb and often, the author is able to surprise with the amazing and yet obvious laws of physics. The whole text is very scientifically accurate and the imagination put into it goes very far while still being plausible. The end, however, was slightly disappointing. Overall a very entertaining and engaging story!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|So profound was this writing, that I could only read in small pieces.  I would be,so upset by what was happening to the characters in this racially driven book, that I couldn't't read on.tHe characters were so real, I felt I was part of the family,but which part, I didn't know.  A good emotional read.
B005LJITS0|1.0|This movie had no ingenuity behind the plot, the special effects are just replaced by random CG, the CG is terrible, the script is terrible and it's boring. The acting is actually not bad, they just had nothing to work with.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I enjoy this game though I don't appeciate having to buy more chances so I stop playing and return when I have built up some more while.  Bought coins once but don't enjoy games that cost me money to play when they are 'free' to begin with.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|. Human & Insightful .  He writes like a poet always.  I would suggest this book to most of my friends.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|I just couldn't figure out how to play this one and get through the door - there were no instructions and no way to get help.  I deleted it from my Kindle.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was spectacular, though this is my second time watching it, that powerful feeling of sadness and anxiety will continue to catch me on every turn in the plot. A very well-made film, the details closely resemble the Hunger Games book at most parts and it'll keep you entertained for the full two hours (that is, if you're the type of person who doesn't get carried away).
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|If you are a Guy Clark fan and, or want to enjoy a newly made desert island disc, simply purchase this disc. It is really that good. There is not a marginal song on it and it is formatted to give the listener a heart felt ride with emotion. It is not meant to buy a cut or two. The production and mastering are first rate as well. You will not be disappointed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I get a  &#34;chill &#34; when...Sorry. .I think AccuWheather is the best weather app on the market today.  It gives you your day at a glance.  Everything you need to know about the weather before you walk out your front door in the morning.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Would be better if could get invest points families faster.  Try hard to resist buying but I guess that is the catch weigh a free game.  Need to pay this  programmers some how
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|This is one hands on cube of pure fun. It's very sensitive though when your moving the different pieces into the cube so be careful cause if you drop it  it takes off points and messes with your score. Your gonna love this game.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like the app, it's just very tedious, especially if you don't have money to purchase pearls. I'd recommend this game if you ever liked playing farmville.
B009A87X80|5.0|She had the purest voice I have heard especially what she was dealing with.<br />You can hear it from her soul!<br />I had one cd and I think one of my kids took it. I knew all the songs.<br />My husband and I were in Maine in a music shop and the guy working there had her cd playing and commented on how much he loved it but did not know her name. I immediately said Eva<br />Cassidy and told him her story. He was shocked. We are from South Carolina. Think it blew his mind that us Southerners would not know that info
B0030B624E|5.0|I loved this movie. I think a lot of people should buy this because it was soo funny and  it was funny when they saw the twinke car, they opened it and there were snow ball instead of twinkes
B00AVXVQGI|4.0|I frequently re-read books I enjoy.  As long as this remains on my Kindle, I'm sure I'll read it again a number of times.  She always writes a good read if you enjoy the period in which she writes -- and I do.
B00DGABUIC|5.0|I wanted to buy two of these but there was only one! Still I loved it! toothless big eyes are gorgeous!!!!
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Fun to read a new author...interludes were driving me nuts at first!  Well developed, well done!  Looking forward to next book!
B00CXLQG0M|5.0|Thanks to its new mechs and Elite ranges, the Rebelle range is something to look forward to despite it's girly overtones.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Its as if Ozzie never left.Great sound. They weren't just going through the motions. This is the comeback album of the year!
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|I like that it still works when  doing have WiFi! It totally helps here in the desert when I have no idea what to wear lol
B000AYEL6U|4.0|This is one that has grown on me after watching and reading it a few times.  The setting is just not pleasant, unfortunately, and there is a great deal of ugliness in the scenery and in some characters' behavior.  It's not as \\"feel good\\" as Wives & Daughters, but it is very well done.  The casting is excellent, the acting perfect, and it does have a happy ending, for all the misery that you have to see throughout the story.  It was written to draw attention to the misery of the working class in mill towns, and it certainly does the job.  So, even thought it's less fun to watch than Cranford or Wives & Daughters, it is a very well done movie.
B00987MQRQ|2.0|This book is, in theory (and pr&eacute;cis) actually fantastic.  Reading it was tedious to say the very least.  More style than substance.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book 5 begins with narratives that parallel lines from Book 4,but then moves into new plot lines.  Many surprises, no wasted chapters, and further deepening of some of the strongest characters.  Previously odious characters teeter close to redeeming themselves, and others who had become somewhat vanilla roar back to life.
1451697686|5.0|Absolutely love this book!!  I found this book to be very inspirational and educational in regards to the whole Zero Waste lifestyle.  I've been sharing it with friends and family and trying to implement  the ideas and tips as much as I can in my life.  It really is possible to use less and to buy smarter.<br />Thank you Bea for writing this book!!!
B003L20IHE|5.0|I first seen this movie on one of the premium channels and instantly wanted to know what was going to happen.  It is a tear jerker so you might want to have some tissues handy.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It`s awesome, but it needs more stuff. It dosen`t even have any armor and only an iron sword. But under all that it`s awesome.
B00866JL96|5.0|Chick Flick for sure.  Zac looks delicious and it's a love story - boy seeks mysterious girl, girl is skeptical, fate throws them in a convenient situation, there's some conflict and of course there is a happy ending where boy and girl end up together.
1843793792|5.0|This CD series is just wonderful . Mr Armitage's voice is like silk, but after a bit you forget it is just one man reading this novel, and not a series of players.  What a treat!
B0069JBKHI|3.0|Just like any new tech its a bit glitchy and slow.  Over all I am happy with it and use it regularly.<br /><br />My first one broke with in 3 weeks,  the video went all distorted with rainbow colors.  Withings support was USELESS,  after 3 attempts to contact them they claimed I must of dropped it &#34;which I did NOT&#34;,  they made no offer to help me.  Lucky Amazon is awesome, I was able to return and have it exchanged by Amazon.
B0018M6J90|5.0|What a delightful little movie! Each of the cast members are well-chosen for this sweet love story about decisions. The acting is perfectly and eloguently executed.  Do we chose to live our lives or let others live them for us?  The musical choices are just enough to give us a sense of the era, the costumes and settings are delightful, and the love story unforgettable.  1939 England, just before it all changes for good.
B0031R5K68|2.0|The Lost Symbol was simply a pretty boring book. It was predictable, and too many unbelievable things. It was a chore to get through and I am wondering if the Robert Langdon series has run out of steam. The first 2 books were entertaining and I almost didn't want the stories to end. In contrast, I couldn't wait for this one to end.
B009A87X80|5.0|I play this CD over and over.  Eva's voice is so clear and delicate; her versions of these well-known songs are what those tunes begged for,  What a talent!  What a tragic end for her and for us all!  How fortunate are we to have these remastered recordings with which to remember her.
B009WUBERW|4.0|If you like lots of explosions and action this movie is for you.  The plot might be a bit cheesy since it seems like every past super star comes out of the woodwork but it is fun intertainment.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk's latest endeavor is a nice little flashback to an era where dance ruled the social mainstream.  I listen to &#34;Get Lucky&#34; and can almost picture the 70's again, but with enough of Daft Punk's flair to keep it relevant in the present.  Another track harkens one of the Daft Punk duo talking about how dance music in the late 60's/70's influenced him.  Overall, the album is great to listen to and shows off Daft Punk's talent and thumbs the nose at release-every-two-year-album artists out there...they don't compromise on each release that they have made and their latest project is exceptional.
B00263HWM8|5.0|I think this was better than MIIII.  Lots of action.  If you like actions movies you will love this movie.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|I have followed Beth Hart for some time and this is the second CD I have order where she teams up with Joe Bonamassa, together it is what I remember music sounding like, in other words it is great, with what we used to call &#34; sound quality &#34; ; ) But again Amazon has sent a CD with a cracked case because they don't protect them. I purchased a bunch of extra cases from Office Max some time ago and use them to replace the cracked ones I get from Amazon, so just a note to the people at Amazon, please protect CD and DVD cases, it is just no fun to look forward to something, then open it and find it CRACKED again...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have already turned quite a few friends on to this app. What a great way  to relax, meditate or fall to sleep!  Being able to control the volume on each layer is a great way to personalize just what you need when you need it.. Being able to save a favorite collage is  Ideal too. I have been using the free &amp; then upgraded to the premium , not so much as the  free App was lacking in anyway, it's just when you find something this well made support it!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Best CD I've heard in years.  Every song is good and ~5 of them are great.  Given that so much of the music today is insipid pop pablum, Black Sabbath has reminded the world what greatness sounds like.<br /><br />I hope that after some rest, Black Sabbath goes back into the studio to record again.  I'd also love to see Led Zeppelin reunite and put out a new rock album after >30 years.<br /><br />\\"13\\" is outstanding.  The only thing I don't like about it is splitting the music into 2 CDs so that they can charge more when the songs would easily fit onto 1 CD.  Go ahead and charge more - but put it on 1 CD!
B000ICZCZS|5.0|I love this movie and have shared it with my son (now 21), my daughter (now 19) and finally my youngest daughter (14).  The topics of bullying and mental illness hit close to home so I felt it important to show my kids that both are prevalent in places across the world.  The humor in the movie &#34;lightens&#34; the mood without diminishing its story-line and its ultimate message.<br /><br />I could (and do) watch this movie over and over... I don't know why I haven't bought it!<br /><br />Enjoy!
0142000655|5.0|After seeing the movie as a child I was surprised to discover that the movie was not based on the entire book, but only started at chapter 37 forward.  I was curious to read how the characters in the movie evolved.  I have finally discovered how and why Adam, Cal and Aron's behaved as such.  The book has answered many questions for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it because of all the different versions being at my fingertip.  I like all the extra things you can do with it once you sign up.  I am surprised this is a free app.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved Gideon and Eva so much. A powerful story about how love is destined for even those who feel they don't deserve it. Great story. Hot and steamy make-up sex!!!!!
0345803485|1.0|It took me almost a whole year to complete this book because it just was NOT interesting. I decided to buy it when the whole hype was going on and I thought I would give it a fair chance even after I had heard how awful it was. Many people said the book was mainly for women over the age of 30, but I am 23 and went in with that frame of mind. Nevertheless, I still found it boring. There was no real story other than an abusive lover and a poor girl who couldn't say no wanted to be together without actually being together.. I hated how it went around in circles. She wants to be with him but doesn't know if she can handle it and that's pretty much what all 300 pages or so are about. Save your time, money, and energy. It boggles my mind that they are making a movie about this book. HOW?!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|There are lovely graphics. The game has Interesting characters and a good story line. Some of the objects are rather more behind things than they are hidden, but there are enough helps.
B000KIPT30|5.0|this box is very well made and will last a long time. the controls are very tight and are not loose or sloppy. i like the fact you can daisy chane this device with more of the same. i am very happy with this purchase and i will be buying a few more now that i know they are made with quality and functions perfectly. i would tell my friends to buy this with no problem.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|The product does exactly as advertised. And Anker tech assistance is forthcoming and very understandable. I had mistakenly thought that I could use this gizmo to convert a home network (cat-5)feed to the USB input on an old laser printer. Anker kindly pointed out that this product has to connect to a computer USB port and in my case the old printer does not \\"speak\\" computer'ese to it's USB input. Perhaps a revision to the product specs listing could help the befuddled avoid my error.
B00062PN6I|4.0|first off these headphones sound very good. the ear cushions are nicely padded. it comes with a 3.5 to 1/4 adaptor and it screws on and off so you can you it on your computer or anything with a 3.5 jack. unscrew the adaptor and your ready to plug it in your guitar amp or any 1/4 inch jack. you need to remember the plug is stereo so you can't plug into a mono device without buying stereo to mono adaptors. i did find the headphones to be a little tight and after wear them for a few hours your ears became a little soar. but i fixed that i by heating the top of the headphones with a warm hair dryer to warm it up then i pressed the top of headphones while i bent out the ear section on both sides at same time just a little bit at a time until i get it wide enough to take that extra pressure off your ears. i did this a few times just a little at a time untill i found where they fit the best. so if you do not mind doing this little trick then these headphones will be perfect. but you do this at your own risk as if you spread them to fast or to far you can break them. so do at your own risk, do not hold me resposible for you doing this and you break them. but like i said take your time and it works very well.
0143124544|5.0|Loved that the patient could choose to decide when to go and the fact that his loved ones were willing to abide with his decision, as difficult as it was for them to say goodbye. Really enjoyed the book.
B00B7G3Y4U|5.0|paranormal Avtivity 4 was just as good as all the others. It tied in well to the other movies as well!
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|this was my first time ordering a movie from Amazon.. so I didn't know exactly what I was doing.. I would've ordered the blue-ray disc rather than the download.. but I am pleased with the movie..
B008XG1X18|1.0|I loved this at first. Now, however, the app crashes every time I attempt to open it. It has to be &quot;force closed&quot; constantly. I'he removed it from my device completely.
B004HD61KE|4.0|James Rollins keeps you glued to the page.  I am so surprised the wide range of historical and scientific knowledge he infuses in his storyline. Most of his books you read at a fast pace.  You don't want to  put the book down!
B0049J2BSM|4.0|My two and a half year old granddaughter stayed interested and attentive throughout the entire movie.  It was very entertaining!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is a great series.  It keeps you involved right from the beginning.  The second series is even better.  Can't wait for the 3rd season to be over!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The author is a genius! So much wisdom, so much life assessment, so much love and loyalty between Enzo & Denny. It will be on my &#34;must re-read list!&#34;
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I downloaded like 4 other programs before I downloaded this one. My son broke his wrist and needed something he could type in and then e-mail his work to get printed. It works perfectly for what we needed and it keeps his work separated by subject.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Book was a great read, and I couldn't put it down.  My wife and I read a lot, and I would definitely recommend this book to her.  I already bought the second one in the series.
044661758X|5.0|I recently came across the Michael Connelly Harry Bosch crime/mystery novels, and have been enjoying them ever since. This is a good one.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app. For cleaning out! Best part it's so user friendly. My 6 year old grandson uses on his kindle also with no problem.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Awesome! Ran out and bought the book after seeing it! Loved them both!! Great casting, filming, and overall creepy zombie effect was perfect!
1934429821|5.0|Paging through this book, seeing Harper's art from the beginning to the end just engages one even more with his wonderful style.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I know a few vocal, die hard Trekkies didn't like it. However, this was well done, well written and had great special effects.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I am always mixing up cords with devices. I have a Razor phone and the cords do not interchange. So when I remove the cord from the docking station to the outlet plug I get them mixed up. It is just nice to have two. I keep this one with the outlet plug. Came in a short period of time. Good price.
B00CKH9WOQ|2.0|How cheap this doll is made must be a joke. One time I received a free Barbie doll with a purchase at Toys R Us and it was a cheap hard plastic- Catty Noir is made the same way...except she was $22. Her shoes don't come off!! Her legs are a very cheap hard plastic, not the typical type of plastic Monster Dolls are made of. Is this a joke? It must be April Fools Day rather than Friday the 13th!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book and loved it. It reminded me of one flew over the cuckoo's nest. I immediately purchased the DVD and was so disappointed the storyline changed and it was not as funny or as strong.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed watching the entire 2nd season on my kindle fire HD. My four year old monopolizes all my tv time!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|It was hilarious.  I'm a drama and action person and generally don't find comedy all that funny.  This was full of action, romance and comedy. Yes, I did say romance, rated G of course.  I saw it on TV and enjoyed it so much I had to get a copy.  I generally don't buy kids movies (as i do not have any) but my sister and I were channel surfing, came across Rio and enjoyed it so much, I wanted to get it to share with the other adults that need a good laugh.  It is perfect for the entire family, even kids!  LOL!  Loved it!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|A DELIGHTFUL MOVE - ENJOYED IT AS IT WAS RELAXING AND ENTERTAINING.  A GROUP OF RETIRED MUSICIANS LIVING IN A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY.
B005N09L5C|4.0|But a bit disjointed in places. Read the book first so this will make more sense.<br />overall well worth watching.
B00BIR381W|5.0|Such a good series, lots of twists and turns and suspense. Even my boyfriend enjoys it! Fantastic series for us
B007IXWL2C|3.0|These books where fun to read because everyone was reading them and you could have fun discussing them, but they were not quality reads, although I look forward to the movie.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Very short game.  Felt like a few puzzles and then you were supposed to buy more.  I have played other games over and over for less money.  I did not appreciate that you were to stop and buy more puzzles so soon.<br />Thanks, Tess
B007IXWKUK|3.0|These books where fun to read because everyone was reading them and you could have fun discussing them, but they were not quality reads, although I look forward to the movie.
B00ATP24NW|2.0|Two stars, I do not like this product. I think the sound engineering is not up to par. Bass, and mid range is muddled, and is not well intergrated with the rest of the recording. Sounds compressed, with low dynamic range.<br />The performance lacks in caliber to other indie recordings and performances, compared to other indie CDs I just received; Alt-J, Ben Howard, Te Head and the Heart, Of Monsters and Men,Tame impala, Foals, and The cinematic Orchestra, just for example.<br />I dont see the musical talent on this recording. It i my recomendation to skip this CD. Buy the one or two songs you like, and skip the rest.<br />There is no audiophile caliber material here.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|This case is made of great material. Strongly recommend it to Kindle Fire HD users out there<br /><br />Thumbs up to this product
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Before I had problem  -  Runs A Camera In Another Room but with this cable it is possible.  100% quality
B004UUKD6W|5.0|This is an excellent CD by one of my favorite groups, which has the nice bonus EP with it.  I have to say that I haven't really listened to the bonus EP yet as I just love the original album so much, but I have several other Queen CDs with the bonus EPs and they are a great offering for true fans.  If you love Queen you need this CD.
B00947NAHU|5.0|Got this as birthday gift for 14 teen year old boy & he loves it!!<br />Some how I thought there'd be more guitar playing, still very well done over the top romp! Half way expected Hero to wander into that western ghost town the Red & white Samurai gangs were battlling over in that Soba western the kid likes so much! I think that one was presented by the wonderfully talented Q.T. Anyway for now everybody happy.<br />Haven't heard of a first person shooter game of Django Unchained, but sure kid will be howling for that when it does come out!
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|It was very intense and kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie, but portions of it did get slightly corny and gory.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This book was great. I had to read it for school and I loved it. Amazing. Just plain....awesome. Wish there were more like it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Really cute game with characters that make you laugh, speedy challenges that test your reaction well, really good graphics and color schemes, a game that truly just about anyone can play.
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|Its a fun and challanging game but would have liked it to be more fast paced - overall review it's okay
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Thank you for everything RedWing! I am blessed to have men and women fight for our Freedom every day like you did for us!
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|Great stuff. It lets me bring beach play home. I'll have to get more. My granddaughter has appropriated this box. I highly recommeng it as a play thing for all ages.
B004CURZFC|3.0|Surprised at the tone & story line of this movie for a children's film. Visually, it was beautiful. It was dark and had a fair bit of violence in it.  My husband said it was like Gladiators meets the Owl Family.  That about sums it up. Maybe not suitable for children under 8
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun game, makes you think about where to go next. Will say I was not expecting to do any math in this game but it did not ruin it for me. If you like to think and you like puzzle games than this game is for you.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I think it is their best album! Not to mention Impossible Germany could be their best song. Two thumbs up👍👍
B00371XIJE|5.0|A beautiful love story between an owner and his pet...and true! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has ever loved an animal!
B00BEIYOHC|5.0|[I bought the combo and here is my review]<br /><br />I really hesitate to call this totally original film a franchise. James Wan creates a film that is a superb experience in the cinema, and is brilliant on the Blu-ray delivery in all respects. Thankfully, it is not a sequel in the traditional sense, and delivers the scares with both barrels. I would expect that you probably know the story by now, if not, you should see INSIDIOUS first and then come back to INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2. This film starts with scares right from the beginning, and takes you on a tremendous roller coaster ride with the original cast.<br />  The extras on Blu-ray are brilliant again. The work in progress: onset Q&A deals with story issues and last 23 minutes. Peripheral vision: behind-the-scenes is a great bonus and last 15 minutes. Insidious: spectral sightings are supposed to be web-i-sodes, which I hope is self-explanatory, but if you have not seen it this is next level freaky, even from the point of view of INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2, mainly because it is so intense and in a few short minutes Lynn Shaye delivers more of a power packed punch than she does in the main film. I think that if you enjoy insidious chapter 2, then insidious spectral sightings is going to be something you love. The extra HAUNTED HOSPITAL: ON LOCATION is kind of so-so but one item in it may give you a spine tingling fright. GHOSTLY TRANSFORMATIONS is about the makeup and is intriguing but would've been better in a wider documentary. Leigh Whannell's Journal is actually quite enjoyable but at eight minutes it is way too short. Overall, whilst I would've liked a commentary in the bonus, I think that what we have at the moment is pretty fun. I hope you enjoy this roller coaster ride as much as I did, or even more; I know I'll be watching it a few more times the volume up and the lights turned down... Pleasant dreams.<br /><br />********************************************************<br /><br />I rarely write a review of the films before the DVD or Blu-ray is out. I had no expectations of what the sequel would bring to the party. After seeing the promo I was won over. Anyone who has seen the promo/s will have an idea of what I mean. The one thing I do agree on is that any comment on this story would give away too much, but not to mention by word-of-mouth that this is a great supernatural horror film would be a disservice. As many horror films as I have seen,I sometimes think I am a little jaded, or even more accepting of the spook type of films. Lucky for me I had about 15 young people sitting in the row behind me, and every time I got spooked, they screemed or more, and this was a good barometer. For a truly scary film this one touches all bases, and if James Wan is leaving horror, then that is a big loss to supernatural horror. If you have ever walked through an old house late at night which you thought was haunted and felt the chills, then this film is for you. Even if you have ever seen what you thought was a ghost, or just a shadow casting a weird caul across your eyes, then this film is for you. Forget what people with negative comments have said, this film checks all the boxes... Pleasant dreams.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I found myself relating to most of the women in this story in one way or another. I also found myself laughing at a lot of the authors descriptions and subtle humor.  The story itself was a good read although I felt the ending was abrupt. Just , ok.. Done!  I just felt it could have been a bit longer and more detailed into the what happened next but I suppose it isn't that sort of a book, which I can appreciate but just not used to..  Anyway, I did enjoy reading it and look forward to trying a few of the authors other books now.
B00328G4Y8|3.0|I purchased this for someone else.  I did not listen to it but the man said he liked it and thats all.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Great special effects.  The 3D was exceptional.  The story was a play on previous stories but it was a fun romp.
B000G73U5Y|4.0|This was purchased as a gift.  I have not listened to it yet but i'm sure it sounds great and there were no issues with order or delivery.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Arnold didn't let me down.  Funny, butt kicking action.  If you like this kind of movie you got to see it.
0062082353|5.0|Being former military I find this book interesting and entertaining.  It takes a special person to go through Sniper school and this books proves the end resullts.
055350259X|5.0|I guess everyone has different opinions.  Because I enjoyed this book so much, I find myself a bit surprised at the negative reviews some have left here.  Bill Bryson's sense of humor speaks to me.  If you enjoy any of his books, I am confident you will love this one.<br /><br />I have read almost every Bill Bryson book (having just ordered the yet to be released One Summer) and I found this to be the best read yet.  Like so many of his books, \\"In A Sunburned Country\\" manages to entertain with humor, describing modern-day Australia while also slipping in historical (hysterical?) facts.  I read this book while lying on the beach in the South Pacific.  At times, (and much to the dismay of people around me) I had to put it down to laugh out loud.  Many sections I have read again and again when I need a good chuckle.  (BB's description of a cricket match is spot-on.)<br /><br />Mr. Bryson shares some fascinating facts and history in this book.  These are not only typical recounts from history books.  These are stories of everyday people, scientific oddities and incredible coincidences that tell more than just the history, but the uniqueness of Australia.  Like he says, \\"Trust me, this is an interesting place.\\"  I would have to agree.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I am a huge Sanderson fan and this little novella was great! Only disappointment is that I want more! Awesome.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|How I wish for you to stop reading any more reviews of this wonderful and magical book. Just read it and you will know what I mean and probably also just want to say &#34;thank you&#34;.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Have you ever read a book that just makes you smile over and over again? One that leaves you at the end with a smile on your face and a super content sigh leaving your lips? That is what Rainbow Rowell's books do for me every single time. I always leave happy and content, and for that reason she has risen to be probably my favorite contemporary writer of the past few years. Her romances are subtle. She doesn't rely on gimmicks to move her readers. She trusts her characters to move me ... and they do each and every time.<br /><br />Have you been looking for a book that captures the angst and adventure of new college students who are heading out to forge their own paths in the world? A book that relies on great story telling, not graphic and sometimes even violent sex scenes? Well, finally that book has arrived. This captures one example of the college experience that most people will be able to relate to. Why can't more New Adult writers write this way?<br /><br />Fangirl continues the streak of five-star amazing books from this talented writer. Like Attachments and Eleanor & Park, Fangirl has a REAL person as the lead character -- not real as in an actual person, but real as in someone with flaws and quirks and things that make them seem incredibly average ... the type of person that you might meet every day at work or school or in your family. Cath is the lead for this story, and more than any of Rainbow's other characters I found her to be the most like me. That was both wonderful and horrifying at the same time for me as I read. Cath is a megafan of a series of fictional books that seem to be the equivalent of the Harry Potter books. Cath doesn't just love the books ... she worships them. And she has been writing fan fiction about the two lead characters of those books for a few years. She's an amazing fan fic writer and has a devoted following of thousands of people. If you are not familiar with the world of fan fiction, this entire scenario will seem a bit odd, so you might familiarize yourself with the phenomenon before you begin. It will give you an appreciation for what Cath's life revolves around.<br /><br />I really loved Cath ... a lot. But she is not perfect. She enters her freshman year of college and she has really poor social skills in so many ways. She avoids the cafeteria and decides that she will subsist on a diet of protein bars for the duration of her time in college simply because she is concerned that she doesn't understand how the cafeteria works. Sadly, I could see myself in that same situation. Cath would rather avoid almost all social interaction and simply live alone in her room, content to live her life through the lives of her fan fic characters. It is almost disturbing to see that in some ways. Luckily Cath has a roommate who isn't exactly the friendliest girl on the planet, but she does decide that Cath needs some social intervention to get her out of the room. And along with that comes Levi, her roommate's maybe boyfriend.<br /><br />Levi was just amazing. He is not a flashy hero for this book. He is just an average nice guy. But he is able to see the wonder inside of Cath. Frankly, I don't know how he can. Cath is so closed off and sometimes even rude at the beginning of the story. But Levi sticks around. This romance is just perfectly subtle. There is no insta-love. There is not this mad rush of hormones. It is gradual and sweet. There shouldn't be a thousand fans of this books who say, \\"I wish there were actually guys out there like Levi.\\" There actually are. He is just so normal and flawed, but kind and perceptive. The scenes between Levi and Cath could be so sweet and heart warming, but they never got into syrupy sweet territory. It never got too hokey. I know I keep saying it, but it's true ... it seems real.<br /><br />There are excellent issues explored in this book regarding divorce, mental health, college alcoholism, and the changes in sibling relationships that occur when they begin anew life in college. All of these are handled wonderfully within the context of the story so that they flow naturally throughout the book. They don't seem like plot devices. They are just part of Cath's life and experiences, things that make her who she is.<br /><br />There are snippets of this fake book series that Cath loves so much found throughout the book along with Cath's fan fiction excerpts. They were almost as fun to read as the actual book. I really did want to know how Cath would write Simon and Baz's next scenes. I could believe that thousands of people would follow her stories. They almost seemed better than the original. It was enough to make me want to go out and explore the world of fan fic that is out there.<br /><br />AMAZING characters, wonderful writing, and a story that feels true to life combine to create another Rainbow Rowell book that will join my favorites list. I will read this one again and again. Five huge stars!new life in college. All of these are handled wonderfully within the context of the story so that they flow naturally throughout the book.

B00ESY7QXI|2.0|The movie was too over the top for me. If you like movies that are extremely dramatic, you may like this.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is one of the best alarm clocks that I have seen in android. Just make sure your volume is up.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The husband's secret<br /><br />Excellent excellent excellent very well written, the way the author slowly entwined the  characters, even the ones that actually were not there, ( the third person) more than  one husband had a secret so to speak. By Chapter 12, I had figured it out. Chapter 19, I was right. Never the less I couldn't stop reading Ah!  I missed the rosary clue. Humorist and emotional so realistic.<br />The thought of being so insecure thinking one is  not good enough for someone to end a relationship, to cause such reaction, was and is incomprehensible, but I guess at that age it's understandable. Then to never know the truth.<br />The story had a lot of truth and life lessons in it<br />Cecilia I thought was courageous she had mettle<br />Couldn't imagine what I'd do in that situation (thought provoking)<br /><br />Great book club book<br />One of the best books I've read.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I would Recommend this to most gamers that want a reasonably priced, good quality sound, and a sturdy construction.<br /><br />I would definately purchase a second one.
B0094K1K8I|5.0|I love scary movies and I have seen the first Paranormal movies which were also good but, for some reason I feel like this one was a little more creepier. I had the feeling of not being able to breath the whole movie because I never knew what was going to happen next. There were many parts that I jumped and even screamed which I dont usually do. I would highly suggest watching this movie if you want a good sit on the edge of your seat movie!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Grissom pulls the reader into a relationship with two women whose roles are defined by the social mandates of the era of slavery in America and the hardships immigrants faced as they assimilated into an unwelcoming new world.  As the characters tell their stories they become living history of a period of time that enforced strict expectations on defined social classes. They experience melting of those roles, the shared emotional and physical suffering both social classes endured and the joy of setting the stage for the breakdown of long accepted dysfunctional society.
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl lives up to its best seller hype; a very good novel full of suspense.  It has a great story, too; you become invested in the characters, despite their flaws. The reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was the sex--it was a little rough and gratuitous.  But don't let it stop you from reading it.  Very good book.
B002MCYWHG|5.0|i enjoyed this product, wish i bought it earliar, because now it's becoming snug in size. great buy, I recommend it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I love the TV series, but I am the type of person that likes to read the story as well. The books are amazing!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Maybe you know a lot of this stuff already, but it is nice to have it summarized in this book. And just maybe there may be few things that you have not thought of before, or at least in the way the author presents them to you.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|nice storyline and easy to keep up with. keeps it interseting<br />. I like the planting and interaction with the npc's
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I like the new relationship between Rick and Kate - not overwhelming but<br />still glad they are finally together.  Exciting twist in some of the shows -<br />and what about finally meeting Castle's Dad -
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|It is a pretty good twist similar to a few other games. For some reason I expected the pieces to fall from the sides or only slide that direction, but that isn't the case. The snapping when the piece is positioned is a little off and sometimes claims a piece won't fit when the outline/shadow shows it is fine. I've had to try and place a piece 3 times to make it fit(even the last piece)...and each try counts as a move.
B008PZZYB2|5.0|Hilarious always an instant classic! Ben stiller is just great in all his movies even his dry humor films are great!
1250029465|5.0|I was blessed by reading the book. I am a cat lover, and I consider her a rich blessing in my life. She has made me a better, more-thoughtful person. I can't imgine my life without my special companion, and I really identified with many of James's emotions concerrning Bob. Animals can truly be life-savers and, most certainly, life enhancers. I pray that James and Bob have a lifetime of rich moments together because theirs is a very special friendship. I look forward to reading more of his books.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|Great series! Can't stop watching. Very original in storylines and themes. Great comedy that offsets the gorey scenes! Makes me laugh out loud. Great music also! Stories,  though not  believable, are about good versus evil and angels and demons/monsters/Gods etc. Also a great story of brotherly love that overcomes all obstacles even death and hell!

1439153663|5.0|A one day read packed with action and sprinkled with humanity. The ending was sad but that was reality in the historical sequence.
B003BA4CAU|4.0|This movie hit home for me since I too have lost the love of my life.  It was nice to see, even in a movie, someone else going thru the process and coming out with hope.  The hunky cast was a total plus!!  :)
0061950726|5.0|I loved Orphan Train!  It was so much of a page turner that I wished there were more pages to read!  I read the book in one day and was so impressed with the historical fact.  The author did her homework before writing this novel.  The intertwining of generations was sureal.  Amazing how the characters were molded be their enviornments and experiences as they pioneered through their young lives.  My only dissapointment was how hurried the ending was.  I felt the author missed a great opportunity to bring full circle to the closure as May learned of her birth mother's life.<br />Iv'e already shared the book with my sister and neice and when I get it back it will go to my friends.
B00B7I8HZ4|5.0|I bought this model the[[ASIN:B00B7I8HZ4 Intel Next Unit of Computing Kit, Black/Grey BOXDCCP847DYE]] along with an msata drive and some RAM. I loaded up openelec and voila I have a flawless XBMC system that my whole family enjoys. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to use this. It quiet and barely uses any electricity.  Once of the best purchases I have made this year!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved this book. Very good! I always knew my dog was a person trapped in a dogs body!! I thought this was a cute book & everyone in my book club enjoyed it also!
B001VTTRC6|5.0|Most of the time the movies aren't nearly as good as the books. Well Clint Eastwood has done it again! He not only captures the essence of the book, but successfully turned it into an entertaining and enjoyable movie. It's so sincere and passionate with some of the best performances I've seen from Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Marcia Gay Harden, and Tim Robbins. The book was great and I love the movie. This is just a masterpiece and such an amazing film. I recommend this to anyone looking for a downright great movie. The performances are so genuine and emotional with a brilliant plot. Just a brilliant movie all around.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Fox cancelled this and Glee is still on?  What is wrong with you people? At least they wrapped up the story line with Serenity. Thank you to all responsible for this production. Your efforts are so very much appreciated.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have heard raves regarding Downton Abbey for a number of years and wanted to experience it for ourselves.  Thanks to Amazon Prime, we were able to watch Season 2 and are looking forward to watching Season 3.  We really got caught up in this series.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I enjoy playing this app. Needs a bigger reef so you can see the fish. To many plants grouped together. need more room to spread them out.
B00DP3IESY|2.0|too much reliance on special effects. Movie too long. Plot was weak. I've seen better post apocalyptic movies elsewhere. not recommended.
B005ES0YA4|4.0|Very comfortable, would like them to be a bit more roomy.  I am very pleased with this product.  Would purchase again.
B00004XQ83|5.0|full of fun. Great dialog and excellent storyline based on a classic. Some of the background humor makes it even funnier. Well recommended.

B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I have read all of the Reacher books, and believe me I was having problems with the casting choice with Cruise.  I had always pictured Reacher as a Eastwood/Dwayne Johnson/Nick Nolte hybrid, so you can imagine my concern with Cruise.  I have to give the man his due though, this was actually better than I expected.<br /><br />Worth a rental but not worth a theater trip.
0689835604|4.0|My son loves this book.  Has since he was 3-4 months old. Now at 12 months, he lifts the flaps himself.  Also gives us an opportunity to go over some of the body parts.  he also plays peekaboo now as a result of this book. Loves it!. The flaps are easy enough for him to handle. I just wish the pages/ flaps were a bit sturdier.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I saw that this movie was coming out soon, so I thought I would finally give this series a read.  This first book is really good, the second book is good-ish, and then it gets kind of eco-political in the same theme as Avatar.  I would suggest reading this book, but think of it as part of a two-book series with a run-on ending.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|accurate program has increased speed on both kindle and anroid phone. less forced closures since installing and less lagging in programs

B00CIOFXH6|5.0|I had originally purchased this video hoping that one of the blondes on the cover was Bobbi Star (a porn actress).  It wasn't.  Although another actress featured within appears to be Eve Angel who stars in multiple girl-girl releases from Viv Thomas (who is one of the best).<br /><br />This video certainly isn't up to Viv Thomas' standards.  But it's not bad for a limited budget European release.<br /><br />The opening scene features a blonde and a brunette who engage each other wearing nude body stockings.  There's quite a bit of foot play in this scene and one other for those of you who like that sort of thing.  Boring. The other segment features two babes dressed as teens in flowery cotton panties making out on pastel colored sheets.<br /><br />The two blondes on the cover were, for me, the cutest and quite buxom.  They were also extremely pretty all over.<br /><br />Eve, of course, is no slouch in the looks department herself, and she appears in two romantic segments, one with another long haired brunette (who sort of resembled Jessica Biel) and one with a short haired blonde.  Eve's tongue covers the most ground.  Both partners have very beautiful figures.<br /><br />The kissing in this video was somewhat sparse and could've been a lot more generous.  The action, however, is very tasty and juicy.  And all of the actresses, for the most part, are also quite attractive.<br /><br />This is a movie I'd highly recommend for both guys and gals who like to watch two beautiful babes being lusciously amorous together.  Seeing Eve Angel is also real treat.  Enjoy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good story. Keeps you on your toes and leaves you with questions. But some of the language is not what I like to read.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This movie provided years of entertainment for Trekkers with the changed timeline.  Very consistent with original series AND very tongue in cheek comedy.  Especially Simon Pegg (love him!).  Chris Pine is a super yummy Captain Kirk...great pirate smile.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Gatsby Shannie Aspiring writer Nick Carraway goes to New York City at the height of the Roaring Twenties and is drawn into the world of the super-rich and the mysterious millionaire, Jay Gatsby.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|C-Beams! Fantastic film, flawless. A lot of questions are left unanswered to spark long debates. Like tears in the rain.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I'm biased because I like UK shows, and this doesn't disappoint. A good old fashioned who done it, although the victim being a child makes it disturbing.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Great movie. If you love Wes Anderson you will love this. Very cute, if you have half a brain then give it a watch.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Woody could have made the movie lower, but with his minimal speaking, it only lowered it to a 4 star.<br />He was a poor choice for his role...
B00A77II0U|5.0|this is a fun and addictive game.  I can hardly put it down to get things donee!very enjoyable. For the price it should have been a lot longer.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Though written in the way a teenage boy speaks this book is surprisingly good. The troubles of this young boy though appearing simple and odd through most if the book are also emotionally inspiring. Must read for everyone.
0765325950|4.0|It felt a little less &#34;together&#34; than the books written by Robert Jordan, but I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked the ending as I alwasy thought I wouldn`t, I couldn´t imagine how they would be able to end a series that had gone on for so long. It´s nostalgic and a little sad to have reached the end as this series has accompanied me for my entire life, basically.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I had not read anything by Kate Morton prior to The Secret Keeper. I was led to this book due to searching for something different, with some true history behind it. The story is complex and intriguing and difficult to put aside to sleep. I highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Strangely ironic story line. Story went well through the book but the ending left me wanting. I would hope that eventually there would be a true prequel or sequel.
B00433QE3M|5.0|Right of the bat I almost didn't buy this album because of some of he negative reviews. I actually do not disagree with many of the negative reviewers.  Many of these songs are not faithfully covered.  Riders on the Storm is a perfect example.  Much of the flavor is changed and if you are looking for a faithful cover, then just buy the Door's release.  What Santana has done is rearrange the works into style, where is guitar become a voice that essentially duets off the lead singer.  You're either going to love it or hate it, I loved it.  There are four arrangements that are worth the cost of the album: While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Photograph, Dance the Night Away and I Ain't Superstitious will tear your soul out.  This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it worked for me,
B004LWZWGA|4.0|The highlight of this seemingly silly and senseless yet still rewatchable film is an hour and seven minutes in when Catwoman calls Bruce Wayne back so he is actually standing next to a charcoal portrait of himself on the wall of her gypsy caravan-like abode.<br /><br />Alfred has to be in the real League of Shadows or Illuminati - the movie makes sense if Bruce Wayne has been manipulated to go into a funk for six years only to emerge at the right time to deliver the necessary blows to effect change.  That may be what Liam Neeson was talking about in Part One.<br /><br />Ultraviolet has yet to work for me.  Now that I know it is from Sony whose Playstation customers got their accounts i.e. credit card information hacked, I have decided to not allow it to access my personal computers.  In God We trust but that would not be Japan's Sky King of a \\"god.\\"
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|There is nothing creditable about this movie.  The acting, dialog and even the visual scenes were poorly executed.  No thought was given to create this movie.  This movie's monetary success is based upon marketing and nothing else.  Its a complete flop! Don't waste your money!! The storyline is weak and as you watch the movie the camera flashes scenes so quickly you don't know what is going on!!  Which in an odd way is good because the whole movie is not worth seeing anyway.  Spend your money elsewhere.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Good. The story attracts attention and it makes you wanting to know what will happen next. It is worth reading.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|Ryan Murphy certainly knows how to end a story and go out with a bang! It was perfect how everything seemed to come together in the end! Julian McMahon and Dylan Walsh were THE perfect Christian and Sean! I cannot say enough good things about this series! I was always captivated, engaged and thoroughly entertained...which is EXACTLY what a TV series SHOULD do! Kudos to you Ryan! It's a shame to see it end, but what a ride it was! Thank you!
B00000D9TQ|4.0|My favorites on here are the power ballads, I Wish it Would Rain, and others.  There are also the catchy tunes that make you want to dance.  Also, In The Air, it has the great drum pieces and reminds me of Miami Vice the series.
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't put this down! Read all 3 books within a week and I'm not a person that enjoys reading. Would definitely reccomend

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Who dosent think this game is awesome? Almost as american as apple pie. Kids love it when we tell them 250 coins gets you cookies and milk after dinner.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|On their previous albums, I only really liked about half of Avenged Sevenfold's songs. This album is much stronger all around. The two slow songs (Crimson Day and Acid Rain) aren't amazing, but put together, this is the band's best album yet. In my opinion, of course.<br />Side note: if you're an Iron Maiden fan, you'll love this album.
B00CTT9646|4.0|I couldn't wait for the movie, so I already bought the blu-ray combo pack at Walmart. I enjoyed the movie, and will watch it again soon, and I suppose the Walmart edition does contain some special features that aren't part of this set.... I may or may not check them out. I'm more into the movies than the special features usually anyway, so I don't care much either way there.<br /><br /> So....  the phaser you ask? It's pretty darn awesome. I had already read the reviews posted here, and agree that perhaps it could have been put together a bit better, but fortunately my copy is definitely acceptable. In fact, I'm really psyched about it. The parts line up well enough unless you get really nit picky about it. The paint looks good, no obvious runs or drips. Feels nice in your hand, and sits in it's stand perfectly. The barrel doesn't spin all the way around freely as mentioned by other reviews, but the two tips can be set straight in front and stay there nicely. I'm glad I read the negative reviews, because that way I was expecting much worse.... This thing is primarily a display/prop model after all. What else are you going to actually do with it? On that score, it rates 5 stars looking at it in it's stand on my shelf. When you see it, you absolutely want to hold it and check it out. I'm keeping mine!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Similar to 50 shades of grey. But I think I liked it better. And there's two more books coming out that will go with these three!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Tom Cruise is always great playing a one off character like this.  Just some guy living his life when, OH NO, he's framed for stealing the knock list, he's framed for a pre-crime, aliens invade, Cameron Diaz can't handle a one night stand, someone is trying to steal a battery, etc.<br /><br />He's makes you believe he's the character in the movie, and that's why it works.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This app is great!Amazing graphics and just like nova 3.sorry the minimum Bush's hushed bag hd hd shush hugged branch
B003U6BE8I|3.0|Its an okay movie as far as kids movies go but make sure your kids are old enough because there are some scary scenes.
B00F35BV64|4.0|It was ok,to much of the old star trek series stories ,Kahn and the yelling out of his name,but the special effects were very good.<br />The movie was worth watching.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|All of the YouTube functionality and great resolution on the Kindle Fire HD.  i would recommend this app.  Works great!
4898153194|5.0|The photos are just lovely! Its so enduring to see the love that there is between these two. Its kind of on the small side but if you like cats and if you like well taken photos then this is the book for you.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Loved the story.  Couldn't put the book down.  I have recommended it to several friends.  Hope they make a movie.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I love the jungle book. I have been collecting all the classic Disney films on dvd and just love to see where the story's came from and how much has changed between the book and the film.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Duckie and I decided to begin watching the best movies. This was the first and it was a grand experience. Mockingbirds!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|One of my all time favorite horse games ever! Horse people must get this game good graphics and really fun
B000V0ON52|5.0|It was delivered much before the estimated delivery date. It is one of my most favorite books! A must read if you like philosophical children's books. This translation is best (its originally a French book) Other translations are lacking in my opinion.
B004132I20|5.0|It's not classic sherlock in jack the ripper era, this is a very good adaptation of sherlock in modern days, played with character by Bennedict, absolutely must see
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app.you can keep multi. Times for the alarm alone with a snooze button.  You can set the volume for alarm to wake any person.  It's very easy to use my husband can even use it.  Great app!
3836538725|5.0|The whole book is definitely the sum of all the dedication Sebastiao put in his work, the photo are stunning !!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|THIS APP IS AWESOME! NOT ONLY CAN YOU PLAY BINGO, BUT YOU CAN ALSO PLAY SLOTS! YOU CAN GET EXTRA ITEMS EVERY 24 HOURS. YOU GET EXTRA BINGO COINS EVERY HOUR. YOU HAVE TOURNAMENTS AND SO... MANY OTHER WAYS TO GAIN EXTRA MONEY AND BINGO COINS!!!<br />YOU MUST TRY!!!!
0821221841|3.0|I bought all 3 classic Ansel Adams' book and for me this one is the least appeal since its mostly contains camera history. But still a good read
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Very heartfelt and honest writing. I appreciate Sheryl's candor and willingness to encourage women to take an active role in leadership opportunities while acknowledging the major challenges that exist.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book is a great book. although it didn't make me cry or anything, i recommend this book to everyone.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Hands down the best season to date for AMC's Walking Dead & they delivered it with a collection piece worthy of the season itself. This collection piece is just awesome and is worth every penny in my opinion!
B002ZG99TK|5.0|ONE GREAT MOVIE<br /><br />UNSTOPPABLE IS FANTASTIC!!  Superb action and special effects.  Sounded great on our surround sound system.  Acting was good and not overdone.  Made me think that, at times like the situation with Syria, this could actually happen.  Really makes one think about where the U.S.A. is really headed.  We saw the movie once and had to buy it right away!<br /><br />W/A/M  London, KY
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game!  Now that he has his own Kindle with Minecraft I get my phone back!  LOL!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a really good game. I wish though that it explained more about each detail. I still can't put it down.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love this game.  Been playing it for a couple years & enjoy going back often as it's rather addictive.  It has a good variety of tiles, with different powers.  Lot's of levels keep it interesting!
B0097HSS4M|4.0|A good on the go editor. Ones editing the picture looses a bit of sharpness. But overall OK. I hope next edition will correct this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series was amazing. So much for these authors writing children's books. The characters setting plot and writing made for an amazing story all around.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Very smart app. Works fine and stable. I tried other apps with the same purpose (paid versions) but this is the best, also to handle bigger sized docs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best series since Sex and the city. I was so addicted I watch seasons 1-3 in 2 weeks. Can't wait for season 4 next year!
6305878323|5.0|Shipping time was awesome!  Product was exactly what it said it was.  Quality product as well and the price was very low!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|It was so fun sitting down with a mixed-age group (4 years old to 70) and not having to cringe at what might appear in the story.<br />It was sheer fun.<br />Our four-year-old jumped up at one point and began dancing with the dancers in the story.<br />And we were all clapping enthusiastically at different parts (to the music).<br />A really sweet, touching, fun story okay for families, but not, like, boring at all.<br />Very well done
0316044695|5.0|This book never lost my interest. Brilliant recollection of an intense training and battle and the folks back home. The best military related book I've ever read. A movie is coming out in January of 2014 and I will see it but I don't think they can possibly come close to what is in this well written book.
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|But that's the extent that I can describe my slight disappointment with this production.  Of all the interviews, I only found Rick Springfield's to contain real substance and I believe it was more that he offered that information as a way to purge rather than was asked.  The interviewees delivered their responses in a monologue style so that the audience is unaware of what questions are being asked.  Were we privy to that information, it's no doubt we'd find the questions keeping a respectful and deferential distance from the artists and staff.  Not that I was looking for dirt, but I think it would have piqued my interest a little more if the interviews or narrative covered more about competition or comparison to other great studios.  Instead we are simply invited to marvel at the wonder of a rare sound board and how people who know what they're doing can make analog tracks sound breathtaking.  Presented this way, the studio themselves can't adequately explain their own success and chalk it up to the sound board mojo and the eventual commercial successes of the bands they recorded.<br /><br />As a musician though, I respect the sort of awe and sense of mystique that many of the artists seem to hold for Sound City and as an unlikely launchpad for the careers of some of the most well-known artists around today, I can't blame the production for approaching from the angle that Sound City is or should be legendary among recording studios.
B000092T6M|4.0|FUN MOVIE!!!  MORGAN FREEMAN DOES A SUPER JOB.  ALAN RICKMAN OVER THE TOP BUT FUN TO WATCH.  WAS LOOKING TO BUY THE BLUE RAY VERSION.  AFTER CHECKING THROUGH ALL THE REVIEWS, GOT MORE BANG FOR MY BUCK WITH ALL THE XTRA'S ON THIS TWO DISC VALUE!  LOVE IT WHEN SPECIAL FEATURES ARE PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE IT FUN FOR THE OWNER OF THE DISC.  SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DID GET YOUR MONIES WORTH.  IN MY THINKING WHEN YOU PURCHASE A BLUE RAY MOVIE, SINCE THEY COST MORE, YOU SHOULD GET MORE IN THE EXTRAS DEPARTMENT.  BUT, I'M NOT SEEING THAT!  THEY ARE GETTING OUR MONEY, YET GIVING BACK NOTHING IN RETURN.
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|Very nice set...but missing some things.  I know there is a behind the scenes for MM2 that is missing.<br /><br />The big let down was that there were no extras at all for MM3  that really stunk.<br /><br />But what a great bunch of films!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE SURFACED LONG BEFORE NOW!!!  THE WAY TO LONG WAIT COST AND SECRET OF THE BAD GUY COST THE FILM MAKERS MONEY AT THE BOX OFFICE.  IF THIS WOULD HAVE COME OUT AT A REASONABLE TIME AFTER THE THE FIRST STAR TREK...IT WOULD HAVE  BEEN A LOT BIGGER HIT!  I REALLY LIKED THIS ONE, HOW IT WAS PUT TOGETHER.  THE WRITING, ACTING AND SO ON...JUST WAY TO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO REALLY HURT.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|This is a great read for understanding the current state of affairs in this country, and around the world.<br />Written in an approachable form, this is worth the money I spent on it to read on the Kindle. I got several key ideas from it about what really matters in driving a modern economy and how blindingly simple it is to get out of our current mess.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|AAA+++MOVIE IN EVERY WAY.  EVERY ONE JUST GREAT IN THIS CLASSIC FROM THE DISNEY STUDIO'S.  THEY DON'T MAKE EM' LIKE THIS ANY MORE, AS THE OLD SAYING GOES!!!  WONDERFUL FROM START TO FINISH.  DICK VAN DYKE SHOULD HAVE WON AN OSCAR!!!  HE WAS EVEY BIT AS GOOD AS JULIE WAS.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I absolutely love this app and everything about it and if you write a review about it they give you more guns
B000GCFY0I|3.0|Interesting concept, it is getting a message across about beauty that's more than skin deep. Good read for young adults.
B00BC24NT4|2.0|I have always liked le Carre but for some reason it didn't seem to hang together.  I never could get involved in it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Such a disappointment. You can't get very far in the game without needing to buy a way to continue the game. Very frustrating.
B000002H5I|5.0|I have never heard this cd but love her music in &#34;New Beginning&#34;, came new at a great price, perfect.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have tried other Pinterest apps but none have been a accurate and efficient as this one. I would recommend this app for anyone
B00DJLLO0M|2.0|Key points:<br /><br />-There are a few good tracks<br />-It's not as memorable as Blackfield I or II<br />-Very short, even for Blackfield (not one song over 4 minutes; only one track comes within 15 seconds of 4 minutes)<br /><br />It's not a bad album, but it's not a good album. It's just ok.<br />There are some good tracks such as \\"Pills\\", \\"Jupiter\\" and \\"Lost Souls\\". I would even list the fresh sounding \\"After the Rain\\" as possibly the best track on the album, but it ends right when it should get started; and that is a major flaw I find with this album, too many songs end when they should continue.<br /><br />The other three Blackfield albums had short songs, yes, but the majority were just under or over 4 minutes. The older songs also felt complete and fulfilling. But Blackfield IV has most of the tracks under 3 minutes or just over, and the songs begin and end so quickly that they become an afterthought.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed 'Welcome To My DNA' a lot, and I think it deserves more praise than people give it. With that said, I was excited to see where Blackfield would go musically after DNA. Unfortunately Blackfield IV sounds like leftover songs from 'Welcome To My DNA', I say unfortunately because if true, the leftover tracks are not that great (aside from a few) and I much would've preferred if Aviv put some more effort into creating some newer tracks.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Rocky rightfully won various awards and Stallone really put himself into these movies as an actor. You can see his physical development and acting skill change throughout the course of these films and they are great movies, especially the first two in my opinion.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The author offers solid examples and thoughtful ideas about how introverts should face this bussiness-oriented world.<br /><br />I highly recommend for INTJ !
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Lethal Weapon 1-4 spans the development of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover through various times and situations. Personal life struggles, toeing the line between law enforcement and vengeance, plus a slew of comedic situations and characters makes all of these movies great.
B000HZCZYW|5.0|This is probably my #2 favorite out of the original Star Trek movies. The screenplay and acting in this movie keeps one on the edge of their seats and probably never figures into the closing scenes of the episode. The villians are well portrayed and well concealed into the script as to make everything that seems obvious...is not.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|It has been some time since I have seen all three Mad Max movies so I had forgotten how solid the storyline for these movies is. It's also funny seeing Mel from his far younger days but he still has the same presence in these films as he does now. The action in all three movies is great, the dry sense of humor is solid, and it's easy to imagine the world existing under such post-apocalyptic conditions. In my opinion these are classic movies and can be enjoyed anytime, especially the range of characters, young and old.
B000HZGNDG|4.0|As a &#34;Trekkie&#34; this movie is one of the least &#34;Star Trek like&#34; episodes to me. I say this because of the fact that it approaches a question that all of us face at some point in time... Where is God?  Good screenplay and sequencing of action in this one.
B000N0WCLC|5.0|This is an excellent film that intertwines personal struggle, questioning of morals, action, and truthful insight into the very controversial existence of blood diamonds. Great actors propel this story throughout the entire film and there are numerous intense scenes!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I really liked this playing game!  The only problem I had with this game was it did not have enough floors.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Fiona is one of my favorites. I have all her albums and she outdoes herself with each new one! Awesome
B00CF34B2I|2.0|It would be Better if i wasnt lied to and told it was free and then download to tell me i have to pay if i want to play F That
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very accurate and detailed. Better than other weather apps by far. The automatic display for each hour is by far the most used feature for myself.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Not what I expected. The story is weak. It doesn't live up to expectation. Wouldn't recommend watching this movie. Waste of money
B006S08RLU|5.0|Cinematography was on point!! Absolutely incredibly directed.<br /><br />Story, acting, ending, sets, language, etc., etc. I really appreciated this film.<br /><br />Worth watching.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Best raceing game I ever played in my life I give it a 5 star rating and its free boss game
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a screwed up woman and marriage!  She was one sick chick.  I really enjoyed the book.  It kept me interested to see just how twisted she could be.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Works well for me as long as I have the alarm sound set at old text alarm sound. For some some reason I will not wake up to any other sound may they should get some other alarm sounds.
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|I thought this ap would be great! But trying to use it on Kindle Fire HD is an exercise in futility. I just use the online version because this one just randomly would freeze up. It became annoying to the extreme, so I had to delete the ap and just keep refusing the obnoxious little invites from the site to get it all over again. I love reading the Mail Online and it's easy enough to do on the Kindle without this glitchy accessory.
B009AMANBA|5.0|The film is a master piece, with a perfectly blended cast. Also the historical acuarcay of the film is spot on all the way from Lincoln's voice to Daniel Sickles's leg.
030758836X|4.0|A great read!! I will look into reading some of her other works. I do not feel I need to write a dissertation for this review.
B003Z0BWRM|2.0|The movie was absolutely terrible, and watching it i was wondering if that was the script's fault, of if it was the source material which was bad.<br />They both were equally at fault. Despite all the action, this book is boring and seems desperate. Desperate to be action packed, desperate to be a romance with a forbidden love story, desperate to have cool characters, desperate to have its own mythology, desperate to offer something new, and it fails at all aforementioned. Characters are either arrogant or whiny. Motivations are weak. Writing is average. It was also too long and bored me very much.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|It touches the very fabric of one's being..captures the essence of living...<br />Very inspiring...in the present times, where 'trust' the core expectation of humans is at stake, this book nudges one to relooked and see us surrounded by trust...if only we look beneath the what and how people do things..look at the intention...<br />A must read....
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I love the way this was all pulled together. And brought to an end... maybe. The door was left open.
0394800184|5.0|I read this book to my son 30 years ago  and he loved it so much we both  memorized it. We could both read it without opening the book. Now,  his daughter is enjoying this same story. Loved that it was a recycled book and I just had to have it since his was long gone. Amazon deliver was very prompt.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I have been unable to download all of the books in my library and I'm not sure if it is due to restrictions on certain books. The Kindle staff at Amazon have been great in working on this issue, following up, and keeping me posted.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I love the look of the characters and the peek into their past. I don't like that they have an alternative timeline that disconnects it from the former series. Just takes the nostalgia away.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Easy to navigate and the voice on the audio reminds me of Charlton Heston in the 10 commandments.  Great app.
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|There is nothing redeeming about this movie.  It bears no semblance to the book, the characters are dull and formulaic while the plot is uninspired and predictable.  Moments that were suppose to be suspenseful were embarrassingly transparent and painfully unsurprising.  There was no real story here (Zombies come, Brad Pitt has an aha moment, things are looking up), no compelling characters (Brad Pitt loves his family)and really nothing emotionally or aesthetically engaging enough on even the most basic of levels.  It felt much more like a two hour preview for a movie the production crew had in mind, but most certainly didn't come close to pulling off.<br /><br />Save your money and your time, don't watch.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is a bad girl!  This story is a hard one to put down.  It would be nice to see the series continue, but that's not likely since the author has passed on.  I would recommend this one to anyone who enjoys mystery/action/thrillers.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This game has many options and levels to keep me interested.  I'm not pleased with the numerous ads in order to continue playing.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This movie was enjoyable enough. I doubt that the excessive blood and head blown off were really necessary and the use of frequent profanity just indicates a lack of vocabulary.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|It was an interesting and well-presented alternative approach to the life of Jesus.  The bibliographical material provided some insight into how this approach was developed but it would have been interesting if the author had added information on the others who practiced &#34;magic&#34; during that era.
B00F35BV64|5.0|As a fan of Classic ST, I am even happier with the New &#34;Classic&#34; ST!!  The 2nd movie was fantastic!  I love both movies.  The actors are spot on, plots are good, acting great - It's all good!  And Cumberbatch was perfecto for his role in ST2!  Can't wait for #3!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of fun. We have had other games that didn't work as well. Easy to use and never locks up. Even the grandkids enjoy this game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has been a nice change from the shows I've watched in the past. I  have really enjoyed this series. They packed a lot into Season 3 and I found I couldn't wait for each episode. I am very disappointed in the ending, but am anxious to see how things resolve themselves next season.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants to take a short escape from your own world.
B00ET0PZDO|3.0|The game is a lot of fun and I really hope that they release not  levels soon, but it doesn't get very challenging until the last three levels.
0385360177|5.0|Great book.  Loved it on audio.  Easy to listen to and pause if I need to.  I have listened to all three books twice.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Amazing book with events similar to The Hunger Games and a plot kind of like Divergent but totally different. I highly recommend reading this book
0385360185|5.0|It was a great ending to a love story with a few twist along he way.  I have recommended this book to others.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I think Tina Fey is hilarious and I really enjoyed this book. Easy, funny read for anyone especially if they enjoy SNL.
B001JV5BIA|2.0|I bought a used copy for one cent (plus shipping). I was curious about the hype. I'd say I got my money's worth. I watched it twice and may watch it again someday if the mood strikes. It really is as bad as people say, but I must say it wasn't nearly as bad as 27 Dresses.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|If you've given any thought to your own creative pursuits, there's nothing in here that's going to floor you. The idea that we are what we eat is not revolutionary. However, I gave this 5 stars because it serves as a quick pep-talk that urges you to take action. The author has a good voice and gives great advice while leaving out any fluff that might bog you down. Also, I  found the illustrations to be quite entertaining as well. :)<br /><br />If you're in the dumps creatively, I recommend you give this a read. It gave me just the reminder, the bit of perspective I needed to get inspired again!<br /><br />Good luck! :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is my favorite book ever. It made me laugh, cry, it broke my heart into a million pieces and stitched it together again. I loved it, I absolutely recommend it. After you read this book I'm pretty sure you'll  will want to read it again.
B00DQVSTCG|4.0|I will make this simple.<br />I have been her fan since the beginning, and I have been a disappointed fan for the last years, especially after Timbaland's productions on Hard Candy. On her favor, Duran Duran were also victims, with a bigger disaster as a result... Therefore I had little to no good expectations at all.<br />But I was wrong; the quality of the show's production is over any other of her previous tours. I don't care if she did playback all over the show (who doesn't do it these days). The stage, the dancers, the choreographies, the segments, the wardrobe (specially Gaultier's designs for the 3rd segment): simply flawless. Not thrilled about the songs selection, but I understand it was the promotion of the MDNA album.<br />And undeniably, the co-star of the show: Rocco! He has the charms! And which mother wouldn't be proud of having her son next to her in front of millions?<br />Get it, and get it on blu ray. If you don't have a blu ray player, get one! This is worth it!
B009YN2M7S|3.0|I was quite surprised at how different the book is from the movie-I have to say that I like the book a lot more. Safe Haven, is really slow at first-the first 45% or so of the book really dragged on. If you aren't a patience reader, then you might want to check out other books from him. If you enjoying &#34;story building&#34; where the picture in front of you gets clearer bit by bit, then you might enjoy sipping on some iced tea and slowly dipping into this story.<br /><br />Katie, is a really closed off character, and I don't really get to know much about her until towards the middle of the book. Plus, life in a small town is charming, but it doesn't really leave her with much to do-therefore, there isn't much action going on in the beginning.<br /><br />When I found out about Katie's secrets and her past life, I felt so devastated for her and realized what a strong woman she is. When her secrets started to spill, was when I really started to feel connected to Katie-as if I wanted to get to know her, and help her despite the fact that she is a character in a story. Her emotions and thought process, felt so real.<br /><br />I also like how this book is realistic, and it took a long time for Katie to be able to trust and feel again. It wasn't as if she met Alex and fell in love right away or if she bonded with Jo the first time they met-it took time, and it was a very slow transition-as it should be. Maybe that was why the book was so long, and dragged on during some points of the story.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed my stay in Southport, North Carolina. The city, as small and sometimes lifeless as it may seem, also seems beautiful and tranquil. An escape from the city, where neighbors genuinely cared for one another and everyone found peace going through the motions. The acres of land and trees and abundance amounts of sunshine, sounded like paradise and I would love to visit.<br /><br />Nicholas Spark is a great story teller, and this book was paradoxically, a serine and emotional read. He knew when to let the reader in on what the characters were thinking; yet, at the same time he knew when to pull back and kept some secrets hidden to grab the reader's attention as well. The love story isn't as memorable as his other works, but keep in mind that Safe Haven is NOT JUST A LOVE STORY. Yes, there is a romance going on but that isn't the primary core of the novel. It is about finding strength in places you'd never known to exist, and forgiveness and moving forward despite the fact that the past clings to us like wet clothes on slippery skin.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Safe Haven, and cannot wait to dive into another one of his books. I appreciate that he is another rare author who continues to produce great works after great works, and there is always a book of his to read. He continues to write, and doesn't have gaps in between releases.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the book-a lot. And it was hard for me to decide to give it 3 or 4 stars. But in the end, it was a memorable read but doesn't strike me as one of the best books I've ever read. None of the characters stood out to me as characters I would want to know more about. Despite that, I still recommend it because it was a good read.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|The pen portion of the sonic screwdriver keeps falling off and the sonic sound is so low that it is barely audible.
1401937519|3.0|I read this book because I heard the author on the radio, and her presence and nearly unbelievable true story were absolutely remarkable. The unusual aspect of her profound physical healing is a striking aspect of her NDE, and is worth reading about. I also highly commend her for undertaking the huge task of writing her story, which is not an easy thing, and she is clearly not a writer. This is a story that needed to be told!<br /><br />That being said, the book is rather poorly written and slow going. I came to this having just finished reading a well-written book, and the contrast jarred me as I slogged through the story of her upbringing. While important to her overall story, for me it was draggy in the telling. As far as later in the book, after her NDE, I appreciate that her experience would be very difficult to put into words, and I know that altered, expanded states can often defy human language~it's almost like having to do a translation job from one reality to another dimension. However, it gets weary how repetitive she is in using phrases over and again. Yes, we are all magnificent (great news!) and perfect just as we are (more great news!), but unlike many spiritual teachers or better writers, she often repeats these same phrases, not adding much depth or ability to \\"feel into\\" how we might access that type of wholeness. (And I realize she pretends neither to be a spiritual teacher nor writer, and again I will say I give her props just for sharing her story). Unfortunately, she doesn't readily convey or translate this state of wonder to anything that is very useful or moving, in my own opinion.<br /><br />That is my criticism. However, her story is amazing and actually worth reading about--or maybe better, hearing her speak if you get the chance. I did find, that for some reason, the end of the book with questions from others and her answers was the most juicy and useful aspect.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I bought this game for my little girl on my phone. As soon as I got my Kindle it was the first thing downloaded. I say its for her but in actuality I play it more often. Its educational and entertaining.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|A very good investment for anyone with a Kinect that games in a small area. However, some games are not compatible with the Kinect Zoom.
1611294185|5.0|Great book I enjoyed reading it cover to cover. I would highly recommend the book or add it to your list of great reads
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Very entertaining movie even for someone who is not a &#34;Trekie.&#34;  Lots of action, good storyline, interesting characters and scenery.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is one of the best games in the world. it could use some more stuff like more monsters and resources. It does need an update, but to occupy yourself why you wait you go on creative mode an  make a great world or go on survival mode and dig and mine for iron, gold, and diamond.
0767020308|5.0|I love this time period and the innocence of the young ladies of her stories. Except for the one, in this case Emma, who thinks she knows so much more than she actually does. Though maddening by all her little games, her failure to realize the damage she is<br />causing nearly costs her her own true love.
B005S39YGU|5.0|SO very funny. Laugh until I have tears in my eyes and my stomach hurts at almost every episode. The characters are perfect depictions of very smart , but very socially inept nerds which I have encountered numerous times in my 30 year career as a teacher. Don't know why I didn't start watching it from the first season when the show the show began, but kept hearing how funny it was from others who had, so decided to purchase earlier seasons and catch up on it. Well worth the money because the humor is priceless!
B00DW5IKJI|5.0|All her best! Lots of beats make it a great work out cd, plus I was really happy it came w the digital download, made my work easy.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|this is maybe the worst movie rendition of gatsby  and the music is not scored to such a movie see something else instead
B00B935SUY|5.0|I love music and live with music daily.  I always look forward to the day when my life is more surrounded by it.  This documentary offers so much in the way of inspiration, appreciation and knowledge of part of what shaped the music industry today in its own scale of a recording studio.  Truly worth watching if you love music and want to learn more about what goes into making albums from the recording side.  It shows the human side of it and is literally priceless.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I never knew there was such a thing as the Orphan Train.<br />Your heart goes out to all the children that had to endure such treatment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have had this app on my Iphone 5 ever since I got it a couple months ago and it is so fun.Its pretty much the Despicable Me version of Temple Run but with cute minions,even cuter upgrades(fluffy unicorn,Gru's missile),and funny boss fights.The aim of the game is to collect bananas while trying to unlock different locations and upgrades.You can also unlock different costumes that help boost your attributes in some way just like in Temple Run.The colors and 3d characters makes this game so fun to play for any age!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I grew up reading Marvel comic books. It was great being able to watch the movie. It really kept me engrossed in the story line. Great special effects.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Grandma doesn't understand it but grandkids love playing it all the time.  They try to teach grandpa but he doesn't get it either.
6305313687|5.0|Great movie! Wish they would make more movies with this great acting. The quality of the film was great, with no damage.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Very stingy with shadow cards especially when only one or two is needed, and I am getting very tired of spending money get nothing in return.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Where does this guy get his history from?  I'm not saying the Bible is always accurate, but I have no idea how he knows things that happened 2,000 years ago without documentation.  I want my money back.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Glad to add this season to my collection.  House was a very good series that I always kept up with each week. It's hard to put into words House as a character.  He was a bit of everything to everyone but you couldn't help but like him.  The series didn't end as I had hoped but it was a satisfying conclusion to a long run.  It will be a while before such a commanding series comes along again.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Jaden Smith does a fabulous job in his role as the karate Kid!  The entire cast was very impressive!  My family enjoyed this movie so much that we purchased it as soon as it was available to buy on Amazon.com.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. It challenges you to think outside of the box, truly! There should be more games like this instead of the bang bang kind. Great job and can't wait for more levels to be developed.
B000IDEORY|5.0|This movie has been a favorite of mine for years!  It is exciting, mixed with sexy scenes and a fabulous love story!
B008A1NSTG|5.0|I remember when this actually happened - and I happen to be a sucker for true or based on true stories. The acting is fine (love John Krasinksi anyway & Drew Barrymore!) and the story is cut lean enough that the action is sustained building to the climax, while still allowing the characters to be fleshed out enough for us to care about them. Especially love the part about the two men from Minnesota who helped keep the holes in the ice open with their invention. Good family movie- shows what we can accomplish when we put aside our differences and work together!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I rented this since I am a Cruise fan and pretty much see all his stuff automatically. After viewing it, I bought the blu-ray--I knew I would want to see it several more times. While I actually liked the story, I was particularly drawn to all the sets--the house in the sky, the pool, the earth landscape, the cool plane he flies, even the drones. I found it easy to become immersed in that world....which made the actual story less important. Watching the extra features greatly enhanced my enjoyment as well. A LOT of work went into making this movie look the way it does. Five stars all around from me.<br /><br />Edited to add: I notice that a lot of reviews are complaining that it was too digitized and too many special effects. How ironic that the producers would go to such lengths for realism (as shown in the extra features).....and they were so successful that the assumption is that it's all fake! The vast barren earth scenes are real, shot in Iceland. The scenes out the windows of the sky house are actual photographs of clouds and sunrise/set, projected onto a 360-degree screen surrounding the house (no blue or green screens). Surprisingly little of this film was CGI.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Nice movie, kids were entertained. Problem with the audio it was choppy in the first 30 minutes, even though the video was fine but there were some brief silent moments. I think I have a decent internet speed connection and my wifi equipment is decent as well.
B00DH1G7DS|1.0|This game, while pretty, forces the player to waste a lot of time watching the numbers spin around every time:<br /><br />All positions of a number are filled up.<br />Any time a row is completed.<br />Any time a box is filled.<br />Any time a column is completed.<br /><br />As the play advances to the end, when the game should go faster, you are forced to wait and watch the numbers spin and dance before you can fill another cell.  I am also not thrilled with the game play where I have to touch a cell and then touch the number that goes in it. That adds strokes to the game. Also, the game won't let you fill in an incorrect number. Way to go.  All you have to do is keep trying numbers until one gets accepted.<br /><br />I wound up uninstalling this game as it turned out to be more of a waste of my time than the usual game should be.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love this show... the cast and the story line keep me interested and waiting for more. It just keeps getting better!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This may be an unfair opinion, as I did not finish reading the book. It is not the type of novel I generally choose. I  gave up on it about a third of the way thru. To me the plot was shopworn , and the writing average at best.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game!!!  It's been a fun way to relax while waiting for appointments and other events.  The only thing I don't like are the pop up adds but that's why it's free.  It doesn't keep me from playing this game.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Just as i thought it would be or my name isnent jace yes chap good news is awesome job of the chipmunk
B0053TMP24|5.0|I really love this book so much and your such a awesome writer I love all of your books but we'll this part I really didn't like or hate BUT I do enjoy how you make each chapter title really funny so I was kinda disappointed when you quit doing that but other than that a reaaaallllllyyyy awesome book. I've already read the third and I absolutely can't wait for the fourth one.<br /><br />MAY THE GOD'S WATCH OVER YOUR READING!<br />Your fellow demigod JONATHAN FITZGERALD
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great game!! love how your able to see the whole person. For anyone downloading  this its a guarantee great game. The search for great adventure/action game is right here!!!!
B00AX6KMGS|4.0|i liked faculty, very interesting.  if you like the strange, i say this is the movie to watch.  it will for sure keep you on your toes.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I am a big Leonardo Dicaprio fan, but this movie just had way too many special effects! Watching the trailers, they really had to cut and paste pieces to make the movie look so great, but in fact, it was, but not as great as it was advertised.<br /><br />If you like a lot of special effects, you will love this movie!<br /><br />If you like Leonardo Dicaprio, you will love this movie!<br /><br />If you like movies that are more real, you will not like this movie!<br /><br />If you like a love stories, you will like this movie.<br /><br />If you are a passionate person, you will like this movie!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Ok game don't get a lot coins to play with.so you got a buy them ..would be better if<br />didn't cost to play each hand
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the music, why would you put current hip hop music into a movie that based in the 1920's awful choice.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|John Corey is my ultimate favorite character and Mr. DeMille cannot write new books with him fast enough for me. Dry, sarcastic wit along with the cocky assuredness of his expertise, John has become a real person to me over the course of these novels!
B00BHMEOP2|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Watched with 14 year old daughter. Only problem was language, but husband and I had already seen it so we knew was coming (lots of f- bombs etc). Great movie!
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|The original Emperor's New Groove is one of my favorite animated movies and I still get a chuckle watching this. That said, the sequel is terrible and not even Saturday morning cartoon quality.
B004UPANAI|5.0|Even if it did not follow the basic original story line from the comics, it was still a good movie.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|greedy -.-ridiculous amount to spend.  I really wanted to finish the game... e.e blah... whatever. Gameloft is allways greedy with its money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game, very very very very addicting!! Love playing it with all of my nieces and nephews all the time!
0553108034|5.0|Great timing. The book was in good condition, only that (all Ice and Fire books that I got for 10 bucks from different sellers ) came with a red dot at the bottom, nothing crazy though.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This is such a great app! My kids love it and so do I. Fun and educational. Easy way to help children understand law of gravity and physics.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Written well but little too boring.<br />“Twist” is not a surprise at all.<br /> Felt like wasted my time reading it
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I really like this book because it works... Whatever we focus our attention on I'd what we get!!! I loved it!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, and did not expect to at all.<br />A nice surprise, I will read her other books.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It was worth watching once, I defininatly would not buy this movie, but it is worth watching once. The plot is a little silly even for fiction movie.
B006X50OPW|4.0|This book really opened my eyes to what goes on inside the mind of the greats. While it has some dated material, the concepts by and large hold true even today. This is a great book that should be read and re-read many times.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This device was cheap and is pretty good for streaming Netflix to tv from my pc. It could use more apps for streaming other content but if you just want to use for Netflix and YouTube it is a good device.
1476733953|5.0|This series is so amazing and I cannot get enough.  Even if I have 5 minutes of free time I find myself picking up the book to read.  The writing is superb and the storyline amazing and engaging!!  On the second shift right now and cannot wait to see what happens!  Bravo Hugh, Bravo!!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I love every song on this short album. I didn't expect the depth in the songs. I am now a fan.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love trying to beat my best time, also like trying to get 3 stars.  Love that you have several games to choose from.  Already played once and cleared all levels. Now going back to try and get 3 stars on each level.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I expected another over-the-top ho-hum shoot 'em up/blow 'em up Tom Cruise sci-fi romp.  Instead, this is a well-thought out and masterfully executed effort that is strongly character driven, romantic, and a spectacular audio visual experience. It is absolutely incredible to watch on the big screen.  The sound mix is near perfect because you almost never think about it. It concentrates on immersing you in the story rather than taking you on an amusement park ride.<br /><br />Cruise delivers, but the female leads also deliver moving performances. I highly recommend that you watch the extras on the making of the movie, and watch it again with the running commentary where director Kosinski and Cruise give you insight and nuance to the story and its twists.  From this, it's clear that Cruise just does not phone it in; that he was deeply immersed in the success of the project. They also discuss how many of the amazing visuals are much more \\"real\\" than we would anticipate in this green screen age...which accounts for much of its impressiveness.<br /><br />There are a lot of flying sequences which are all extremely well done. If you watch the behind the scenes extras, you'll find out how they did it. The in-cockpit effects with the actors are the best I've ever seen, and as a former fighter pilot, I can tell you that it adds exceptional realism physically and in the influence on the actors' performances.<br /><br />I agree that the visuals have an entirely different experience depending on the size of the screen you watch. This movie was designed for the big screen, and there is depth to detail that just cannot be seen on the small screen. Close-ups of actors are deeply immersive on the big screen because of the insanely sharp definition and depth in actors' eyes due to the cinematography and new HD camera and lenses. When emotion is high, this becomes an amazingly powerful tool in this film.<br /><br />Find a friend with a front projection home theater and bring the popcorn.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I discovered James's blog and this book yesterday, and read it every chance I had over the last 24 hours. I'm now about to see if there's an audio version so I can listen to it during commutes to keep my ass in reality. I don't even know what all this information will do for me, but it completely straightforward and useful and resonated with dangling nerves I've been belly-aching over for years.  You know what I am grateful for this weekend? Mr. JA putting down in writing why it doesn't need to be so ridiculously complicated to live well and how to build it up.  I've officially nominated and chosen myself to live well.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Endings are hard to get right and this was just fine, wrapped it all up in a bow for me
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Good capture of personalities and the political action at the time.  Great acting and scene sets.  Best to be viewed by serious adult viewling because the movie is mostly conversations with very little action shots.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star Trek of old and new are the best!  My Grand daughter has really gotten into the new versions and loves it!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I love to listen to Josh sing. He makes beautiful music. Bought this to add to my collection of his songs.
B0026772N8|5.0|I've never read any books like this before, and I have to say I am hooked. I love the book, and the thoughts he presents in it. I don't know if you'll like it though. To be honest, I'm not even sure why you're reading this. My opinion shouldn't affect your opinion at all. What are you, some sort of sheep? Following the lead of others? Listening to what other people like? Baaaa Baaa!<br />Go! Make your own opinions! Live your own life! Be free!<br /><br />Jez
B007ZI06FE|5.0|If you like steam punk and supernatural romances, you'll love Kiss of Steel.  The female main character is strong, smart and buttoned-up sexy.  The male main character never new what hit him once she came into his world.  The author creates believable engaging characters and a vivid, wonderful new steam punk style world.  Can't wait for the next book in the series!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I still find this game interesting, is not my first choice when I choose to play... I find quite annoying the fastest of energy consumption... when I am in the middle of searching an item, I find myself without energy... but is ok, I'm going to other game and while I am playing the energy is building up. :)
1423101472|5.0|My 9-year old son loves the Percy Jackson series of books and loves this one as well.  Great to get a child interested in reading longer chapter books!
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Awesome game!  Very challenging and great graphics.  Some of the puzzles are almost too difficult, but I really enjoyed playing.
0788844989|1.0|only got the documentary (disk 2 - additional features) and not the disk itself.<br /><br />(watched the documentary and wasn't impressed by the main character -- as she's beginning to sing she asks for cigarettes :) )
B00C061I1M|5.0|I purchased it after hearing pushin against a stone but I love Shotgun, could listen to it over and over. Great hillbilly jazzy sound.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|classic, edgy, and smart!<br />Jake Bugg is a true song writer, there is thought and meaning in every song.<br />Poetic at sometimes and a must have in your music collection.
B00CATSONE|4.0|And book is full of interesting facts about N.Tesla, and it is very easy to read it. Was very interesting to know about Edison and Tesla &#34;war&#34;.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I felt that the author was very believable in his journey to heaven and gave a detailed description of his events.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Friends of mine told me this was a good film. They recommended it warmly. And I still didn't expect it to be *this* good.<br />The story in itself is incredible enough, I mean, of course it deserves to be recount as a story (all the events actually happened in 1920s Los Angeles). But what gripped me was the execution.<br />The setting is so accurate and so vivid you really think to be there. The pace of the film is just right. There isn't much action, because this is mostly an intimate story, but emotions comes to the viewer so strongly - through events and characters' actions and reactions that are always logic and never over the top - that you naturally feel involved. You naturally feel for this mother.<br /><br />But I think what really involved me in the story so much are the characters and the actors.<br />All the actors are outstanding, in my opinion, no matter how long or short they appeared on the screen. I liked John Malkovich and Michael Kelly in particular, although they both appear on screen for limited time (Kelly only appears in the very last part of the film).<br />But it's Angelina Jolie's performance that really stayed with me. She was intense as Christine Collins, this single mother that fights against everyone to get her child back. She was always demurred, never over the top, and still so emotionally invested that this viewer could only root for her from start to end.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Downton Abbey was great. So much drama with twists and turns. However, I did not enjoy the ending of Season 3, with Mary's husband dying in an automobile accident right after she gave birth to their baby boy! So sad,
B001AQQR2S|5.0|One of my favorite movies! Very light and comical :) I've watched it at least 5 times already, and I recommend this movie to everyone, especially families looking for a movie to watch with their kids.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Watched the premiere on the Disney channel and knew we had to have the DVD. Great movie for the kids. Love that it was dedicated to Annette Funicello.  Reminded me of Grease + Beach Blanket Bingo.  The whole family can't stop singing the songs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game, I love it!!!!!!<br />Next best game since Angry Birds came out.<br />A word for the wise &#34;Be careful to not become to addicted...like I am &#62;_&#60;&#34;
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Though of course it is a rarity for a movie to match up with its leafed counterpart, this attempt surely is admirable and quite entertaining. The actors and actresses selected could not have been more perfectly chosen; the cast truly embodies their roles and bring a more accessible picture of the characters to a wider audience.
006029129X|5.0|I had completely forgotten about Harold until I saw something about him recently on Facebook. I thought I'd get it for my 3-year old son, so I could read it to him like my parents read it to me back in the 70s. We got the book, and as I read the story about the enchanted garden (the one I knew from my childhood), it was like I was sucked back in time with those unforgettable pictures! I now remember being completely engrossed in the little guy who creates his own world with his purple crayon. Wonderful book that stimulates the imagination.  /CW
B008QZ1ZYQ|1.0|Don't know how it works .does not do as it should when you tap on a line it won't cancel the line so. You can't stop the bug.
B003O86FMW|4.0|For someone who didn't even want to read these books, I can't read them fast enough!  Intriguing, unexpected twists & turns keep the plot fast paced & exciting.  I can't wait to find out how it turns out.  Book 3 will be my next read!
B00B2166BS|5.0|The pogo cable is by far the fastest way to recharge the nexus 10 tablet. You can easily get a full charge in 2 hours or less vs the USB cable.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Excellent film. Love it because it helped me understand why it took so long to get Bin Laden. It was not an easy task and I didn't even know it was a woman who worked tirelessly to get this terrorist. She never gave up looking for leads. I almost felt her frustration when she got no support from the higher ups. I love it and do recommend it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is concise and to the point and tells you what you need to know, in the order that you need to know it. I highly recommend it for the first time Kindle publisher.
0307386171|2.0|Ian McEwan is one of my favorite authors from any time or place.  Atonement, The Innocents, Amsterdam, Saturday, Enduring Love...I've found that virtually every single one of his novels is an absolute pleasure to read.  However, I absolutely hated On Chesil Beach.  The characters are flat and boring, the story of no apparent consequence whatsoever.  McEwan must have had his reasons for writing this one but I can't figure out what they were for the life of me.<br /><br />Now evidently many people did enjoy this novel and perhaps you will too. I write this review only to warn you that if you enjoy McEwan's novels for their mystery and suspense, this one may well disappoint.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Couldn't wait for each episode.  Watched it during the season but hubby wouldn't watch.  He doesnt like &#34;Horror Shows&#34;  Made him watch 1 episode on amazon and he was hooked.  We marathon watched the entire season in one day.  Couch potato until it was over.
B002RT85RW|5.0|This is an awesome bundle of discs I love it.. copied most of my data from an external drive to take a back up of that to be on the safer side. The copying is slow but this is better than External drives that also can get a virus

A few songs might even put you to sleep...
B0092YO8C6|5.0|Great Album! Go Austin & Ally!  I'm astounded at the vocals of this young artist. He is one to watch.
B009ZQJ0ME|5.0|The movie is great from start to finish. It is a Psychological thriller. It reminds of the book/movie 1984 by George Owens. I wouldnt mind watching this movie again.

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have a short period of time playing this game, but love it.  This game can be addictive.  I like hidden object games and puzzles that make you think.  This game has both.

B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton Abbey is a 5 star pleaser!  The scrip, setting, costumes, cast both upstairs and downstairs are outstanding!  The historic timeline is well captured as the story moves through the generations.  I'm not a viewer who faithfully follows programs, but this story has changed that!  Anxiously awaiting Season 4!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book takes us once again into a life that is unimaginable to me, but I have seen it, and I think others should, at least through this author's eyes.  One act and the resultant break from a family member puts a family on a heart-breaking track.  All the ways this one act, and the reasons for it, have life-changing results for all the characters in the book make it a great read.
0452295548|1.0|I really had high hopes for this book, especially being a nurse.  When I started reading it, I didn't feel any connection with the author whatsoever and this unfortunately continued through the whole 140 pages I did make it through.  I'm not denying the fact that it's incredible that someone who studies the brain survived such a massive stroke and fully recovered, but it doesn't seem like it was a humbling experience at all for Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor (as she refers to herself in the entire book-- I don't recall her once referring to herself as just \\"Jill\\").  To me it felt like it inflated her ego even more and there were even some instances I felt like as she was describing the day of the stroke, she was not-so-secretly hoping she was indeed having her \\"stroke of insight\\" so that she, the Harvard trained brain scientist (she doesn't let you forget that either), could write a book about it.  There is also a chapter where she describes the brain and its functions in \\"laymen's\\" terms, but having studied the brain some myself even I had a hard time following it (maybe because I was totally not into the book).  I was determined to finish the book because it is pretty short, but reading each page was like pulling teeth and I eventually gave up.  It truly could have been an incredible story, but needed a different teller.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I've used a different type of swipe keyboard before, and I definitely prefer SwiftKey. It is not without its flaws, but the predictive ability is very nice and seems to be getting better as I use it. I do feel a little weary about what I type being analyzed, but their privacy policy claims they use &#34;anonymized requests&#34;. I'm still getting used to using it, but the learning curve is low and I already feel like i can type faster. One nice feature is the ability to swipe and add spaces so you can just keep swiping for the entire message.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Okay - so I love this despite the director and writing.  The stars and acting is just perfect.  Pine's Kirk, Quinto's Spock, and above all else Urban's McCoy is just perfect as the trinity in charge of the sweetest ship around - the USS Enterprise.  I saw this in theatres twice - and it was worth it.  Also, I loved Benedict's John Harrison (I wish they would have cast a POC as Khan - cmon guys) but Benny's acting as John Harrison (which is what I am lying to myself as his character for most of the movie) was amazing.  All around - great acting.
B000EGCITG|4.0|There are some really good songs on this album, I like listening to it.  Some of the better songs have not been played on the air as much but are just as good as the hits. Cause I can is a good one, U and ur hand,
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|God, she makes me feel so unaccomplished.  16 and putting out albums like this!  Lorde, you are amazing.  What a voice - reminds me of Lana Del Rey - another on of my favorites. I cannot wait to see what else she puts out on her long career ahead of her.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Funhouse was one of her best albums, Glitter in the Air, Don't leave me, Ave Maria, are just a few of my favorites, So looking forward to seeing her in October!
B005LAII80|5.0|Sweet Lord! This movie is amazing.  I want them to put out a sequel with Karl Urban and everything.  This was the perfect movie to watch when I was feeling down/angry at the world.  Karl Urban's Dredd is perfect - just erases the crazy image that was Sly Stallone's Dredd.  Which I thank you for, Karl Urban.  I have already convinced ten other friends to watch it since buying it last month.  So good!
1594135851|5.0|the final chapter to the story of Katniss and Prim.  I love the series and the story it tells.  The ending although sad also teaches that you can come back from the farthest brinks of despair , there may be scars but it can be done.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Loved the second season as much as the first one. looking forward to the next season on television, and then getting the third season when its available. hope they keep continuing the story line. I also received the item fast and in perfect condition. Thanks.
0859531368|5.0|I am happy with the purchase. The price is fair and the book looks great for my little nephew. It came well packaged.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|It works and that's all I can ask from an App.  I would still rather use my computer, but the app is nice if I have a random thought on the road;)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I keep coming back to it to play it so it has to be somewhat entertaining<br />It's a city builder game if your into that then you should like it
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a &#34;can't put down&#34; book from beginning to end.  An electrical subject - an easy read - very well written.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft has always been my favorite game. Minecraft pe is no exception. I love this game so much. Highly recommend it.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|I like how well the author describes the Lewis communities and I can see that he really has put an effort in understanding the people´s life there. I like the way the author goes back and forth in the story, giving us enough information about Fin´s life on Lewis and after Lewis.
B008OFNWQ2|5.0|The build quality on this bag, so far, is very good, had it about a month.  Lots of pockets to put stuff, plenty of room for whatever I need to bring with me, and it fits my MSi GS70 which is a very large 17&#34; laptop.<br /><br />All in all, it is serving me well, and fits everything I need, as long as the bag holds together I'll be good with this for a long time.  Highly recommended for large laptops.
B004FP1WX0|3.0|Intresting plot that tleaves you guessing if this is real or a contrived situation that was imagined.<br /><br />It is an interesting comment on our current infatuation with meeting and getting to know people on line, without having the benefit of really ever meeting them in person.  What is real?  What is pretend?  Sometimes 'real people&#34; pretend, bt physical reality limits the exrent of the fiction.  On line, those limits are entirely removed, and only limited by the effort the eprson creating the illusion wishes to put in.  3 stars because I was left feeling this could have been much more dramatic and explored more deeply the motivations behind on-line fiction and roll playing,
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Fully functional well thought out little calculator.  The fact that it runs on my Kindle 7 HD ensures that I am only hitting one key at a time.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I think this book is just what young adults are into. I liked it and will read more in the series.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This might be good for backpacking, as is will make a knife sharper, but won't give a particularly sharp edge.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|An amazing short history of the Sound City Studios. Some amazing stories (Rick Springfield?!?!) and AMAZING music. And I love the &#34;jam sessions&#34; at the end.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Had my G930 for several years, sound is excellent.  Comfort is not bad, you tend to get sweaty after several hours of wearing the headset though.  The signal reception is really good and better than any non-gaming wireless Logitech headset I have owned in the past and now.  Really liked this headset, but it does have one flaw.  It is fragile, I dropped the headset from hanging it on a hook against the wall.  The hinges have plastic covers that cracked and broke off on both sides.  Ended up where the headset is no longer usable as it started to just come up with a bunch of static and then friends say they could barely hear me while gaming.  I have now replaced it with a Plantronics Gamecom 780 headset that is wired.  Wireless might be cool, but they tend to be heavier than wired headset so I figured this time I wanted a more durable headset.  No comments on the wired Plantronics as I just purchased them today, sound great (just as good as the G930), and quality seems to be good.  I'll write a review after I have enough hours with the Plantronics in the future.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Nothing like Big Bang Theory and season 4 is just as good as the first.  Like I said before a day without BBT is a day without sunshine.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|Like the original crew, and the story line!!  One of my favorite movies, from the original crew!! A must Get
B0053O89WY|5.0|a day without BBT is like a day without sunshine.  Great season.  Took forever for me to watch the first show but now I'm hooked.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|My favorite &#34;new crew&#34; film like the interaction of the players. Brings elements and background into focus, to understand the story line flow.
B002BJGYU8|5.0|I love all the seasons of Gilmore Girls and this arrived in good condition and on time.  Will enjoy this season on DVD!
B000SP1SH6|5.0|I love this movie and it is worth watching more than one. It is funny and comforting in some way. It a feel good movie that a classic
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|I love Hillary Scott's voice.  She is the reason I bought the album and that I enjoy so many of the songs.  I thoroughly love &#34;It Ain't Pretty&#34; and &#34;Nothin' Like the First Time.&#34;
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I  love the continuing excitement in David Baldacci books.  He is a great author and Will Robie is a wonderful and exciting<br />character.  I picture Bruce Willis playing the part in a movie along with Helen Mirren .
0061120073|5.0|The book was as described and very pleased with the arrival. Shipping on the other had was a bit long, but glad it arrived just in time before my daughter started school. Thank you and pleasure doing business with. Thank you!
B004EF8ARM|5.0|I love, love, love this movie!  I laughed, cried, snickered, sighed, became annoyed... my emotions showed mixture throughout. However, the undeniable emotion of love prevailed and I loved every minute of this film.  I have watched it twice before and cried more, during this viewing, than both times previously.<br /><br />I love both of the main male characters/actors and, finally realized, that I have found the perfect combination in an admirer/suitor of my dreams in this reality :-).  This cry of contentment was soothing to my heart and soul.  Watch and enjoy... for I have, truly!<br /><br />All the best...
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|My two teenage sons, as well as my husband and I loved this movie. The special effects were great, and the story line was very engaging which kept us interested the whole way through the film. We not only highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies in this genre, but we will be purchasing it so that we can watch it again and again. :)
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|He has found a contented place it seems and the music reflects it.  There is a lovely soulfulness to this cd.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series!  Can't wait for season 4.  I wish there were more series like this to choose from.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Its very unusual in a bookclub of males and females of all walks of life and literary persuasions to unanimously agree that they loved the book.<br />A very rare Laugh out Loud book that was hard to put down. Would highly recommend. 9/10 from me
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This may be a youth book, but adults will enjoy it as well.  Very astute and in touch with what it feels like to be 10 years old.  Makes you think.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. If you love puzzle games like me you will really enjoy this game.
B004S5C91Q|3.0|Certainly thought provoking and gripping at times. Found much of it unrealistic though, particularly the advanced level of thinking of a 5 year old. I also felt the first half really dragged on and the child's narrative became a little grating and tiresome. A decent read but far from a &#34;great&#34; work of fiction.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love how everything looks exactually like the movie. I just hate how in the higher levels such as 25 u have to have A LOT of experience
B001CDR1FG|5.0|The speical effects are group, and it helps lay out the character of Banner for not only the next Hulk film, but for the Avengers as well.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|My granddaughter really loves this.  She loves stickers (3 yr old) so these reusable are right down her alley.  As soon as her baby brother goes down for a nap she gets them out.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I don't like Facebook on the Kindle Fire HD.  It doesn't compare to using it on a regular computer or laptop.  I am very disappointed with it and will rarely if ever use it with my Kindle.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I was given this book in return of an honest review by the author.<br /><br />I am speechless to say the least of this book. I was asked to review Peter: A Darkened Fairytale and was more then excited when I was asked to review Peter, Enchantment and Stardust-The Poems. I normally am not drawn to books of poetry, but this one drew me in from the start. This book opened you up even more to the the first one. I think that one of my favorite Poems was Wildflower Valley, because I could really almost feel as if I was in this mystical Valley with all it's wonders.<br /><br />I can't wait to read more from this author. Defiantly one to keep watching.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|We enjoyed the movie very much and look forward to the next one. It was a bit predictable, but fun :)
0071636080|5.0|For anyone who wants to put on a great presentation this is a must read. Steve Jobs had this figured out to a tee.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Just watched Season 2, another homerun for this show.  Claire Danes is amazing! Can't wait for Season 3 and where the show will go from the Langley explosion.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little divice is so good. Its easy to use, very usefull and can use it in any TV with HDMI output.
B000TEPL92|5.0|Love this album, I knew all the songs from growing and my mother listening to them.  Great voice, great lyrics!
B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC-BACK IN BLACK: The brain pounding platter by which all others are measured, this titanic follow up to departed belter BON SCOTT's cocky curtain call HIGHWAY TO HELL netted AC/DC the top selling rock album of all time, with around fifty million units moved. A jam packed juggernaut punctuated by axe mutilators MALCOM YOUNG's crunchy rhythmic riffs and big bro ANGUS' bad boy blasts of galvanized boogie, the ominous opener HELLS BELLS plays on an oft visited \\"down under\\" theme...and we're not talkin' Australia, folks. Rowdy radio faves SHOOT TO THRILL and BACK IN BLACK are merely two more of the heavy highlights, with the titillating anthem YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG rivaled only by HIGHWAY TO HELL's title track for sheer sleaze-rock awesomeness. Tough guy front man BRIAN JOHNSON may lack SCOTT's leering howl and bawdy sense of humor, but proves a fine gravel-gargling caterwauler in his own right; his bloozey, blood curdling screech on ROCK & ROLL AIN'T NOISE POLLUTION caps a platter so nearly perfect in its raw, unbridled energy and over the top execution, it's not a shocker that AC/DC never topped it.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE BELLS
B005MHI0QM|5.0|It is the real story of anne frank just....,. WONDERFUL her and her family go into hiding during the holocaust and she just writes about her life in the secret annex❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I BOUGHT THE KINDLE FIRE HD BECAUSE I WAS TOLD BY COMNPUTER THAT I<br />NEED THE KINGLE HD.  STILL HAVEN'T GOT THE GAME.  ORDER WHAT I THOUGHT<br />WAS THE AME BUT INSTEAD I GOT 2 BOOKS WHEN I TRIED TO ORDER GAME 2X'S
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I liked the story line and the acting. All beautifully done and a wonderful way to honor the lives and sacrifices made be the help...
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is a fiction novel about the complexities of a marriage gone deadly.  Nick's wife, Amy disappears and the reader is left following the storyline with an altered narration between Nick and Amy describing their perspective in different times.<br /><br />The book was easy to follow and I liked the narration.  The author went into great depth of the characters and I found myself wanting to know more.<br /><br />Some of the story was downright unbelievable and I do not want to write a spoiler, but will say that I think the author went overboard and some of the actions of the characters.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Exactly what the title is. If you don't like dubstep or violin, you won't like this album. For the rest of the world, this a fantastic album with beautiful songs. No lyrics, who needs them? Great listen!
B0064MGU98|4.0|The writing and themes are so much better in this show than most of television. Enjoyable to watch and some nice suits on display!
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Everyone should be exposed to Janelle Monae. EVERYONE! Start with her first album, Metropolis: The Chase, then get her second album, The Archandroid, and then you are completely prepped for the awesomeness that is her third album in a series of storytelling songs and creative vocals and wicked guitar riffs. Just buy it.
B005DR64QE|5.0|Great movie to look at with a lot of suspense. I think it was worth the purchase. Buy it and you'll see that I was right.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Amazing story telling. Couldn't put it down! The scenes of Barcelona are haunting and the descriptions feel like you are standings beside the protagonists
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Some songs off the album were decent, but Ghetto Woman along with few others like It's Code, another song produce with Prince are a keeper.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is great for people that like to play their way the only problem is the energy gets low quick
B005OT2YVA|5.0|A other great story -  (and even better than the comics) - with just another exceptional special effects and good acting
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I loved the sense of humor of the characters plus the mystery and ending was unpredictable.  It's hard to find good writing these days so this series is a winner for me.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Many will say that there is no true storyline. And they'd be right! This isn't for people so unused to reading nonlinear, or who attach mainly to characters. This book is insanely well written, and told in snippets. This book is literally a journal of short interviews with the 'survivors' of WWZ. The characters are memorable in some cases, not so much in the next, because it is a story about experiences, not characters. Frankly I thought this was easy enough to understand, however after checking out the 1 star reviews, apparently some people can only understand standard plot/character books. This book is primarily political, however it doesn't seem like it, it covers many countries and peoples response to this. For instance, America hears about it, so America creates a placebo pill/vaccine. The Arabs hear of Israels offer of sanctuary, they think it's a ploy. The Japanese hear about it, they evacuate (all but a few key individuals). North Korea is even given a mysterious backup plan. This book is all about emotion and response, not character and plot. Is there ever truly a plot or character in a war story? This is one of the absolute best books I have ever had the privilege of reading. It's setup just makes you want to know more. If you are able to think and enjoy fictional history, you'll love it!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Also have season 3, have watched them all twice in anticapation of Season 4, October 13th. Addicting!! Miss Merle and Shane
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|somewhat similar to temple run but with more variety. instead of tilting your device you swipe to move side to side, but you still swipe forward to jump and back to slide. you can also buy power ups and complete goals like in temple run
B000OV85AW|5.0|A classic movie, contrasting two classic acting styles...a riveting story line...character driven with an amazing soundtrack as well.<br />Marv Berman
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Horse game very interactive super cute easy to use game kids love parents love huge fan kids are fan cute cute cute
B005USZML4|3.0|There is too much filler and duplication from other Boone novels. Grishman must be getting stale if he has to resort to this kind of plot.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb racing is amazing it is one game I will let my brothers play<br />It is also a good game to play on a long rided
B00A1AU72A|5.0|this is one of  the greatest american classics ever made! Glad i purchased this!! i love movies and this is a great film to show someone whos never seen it or who hasnt seen it in a long time!
B000XUBC5E|1.0|USA Today said this novel has more twists and turns than an amusement park ride, and they are right. The problem is that many of these twists and turns are ridiculous and confusing. Stay away from this one-he has written far better.
0061743526|5.0|bought this book because i love the movie! and its awesome!!  definately completely different then movie of course but definately worth the buy!
B007SGM084|5.0|Here are reviews from all three books<br />I love this book! I've read it before, but wanted to read it again. It was just as good the second time.<br /><br />Anna's roommate is sick with the flu. Kate has attempted to get an interview with Christian Grey for 9 months for the student paper she works on. She can't pass up this chance, so she begs Anna to do the interview for her, because she is sick.<br />Anna is nervous, and literally falls into Christian's office. Anna reads the questions that Kate has prepared. One of the questions was, Christian are you gay? She was so embarrassed, and explained that she was reading the questions that her roommate wrote down. After the interview Christian wants more time with Anna. He ask if he can show her the building. Anna says no, that she needs to get home to study. Christian is torn. He knows he needs to stay away from Anna, but he is drawn to her. He goes to her work and shops. He agrees to a photo shoot to go along with the article. Before long Christian is attempting to talk Anna into being his submissive. He gave her rules, and a contract to read and go over before she makes up her mind. Anna is so innocent. She doesn't know what half of it means.<br />I love how Anna's subconscious is almost like another character in this wonder story. The subconscious will sometimes cheer Anna on, or at times make snide comments.<br /><br />My favorite parts to the book are below:<br />Sample from chapter 10:\\"What's vanilla sex?\\" I ask, if anything to distract myself from the intense, burning, sexy look he's giving me. He laughs. \\"Just straightforward sex, Anastasia. No toys, no add-ons,\\" He shrugs. \\"You know...Well actually you don't, but that's what it means.\\" \\"Oh.\\" I thought it was chocolate fudge brownie sex that we had, with a cherry on the top. But hey, what do I know?\\"<br /><br />Sample from chapter 11: The only man I've ever been attracted to, and he comes with a bloody contract, a flogger, and a whole world of issues. Well, at least I got my way this weekend. My inner goddess stops and smiles serenely. Oh yes... She mouths, nodding at me smugly. I flush at the memory<br /><br />Sample from chapter 26: This is a man in need. His fear is naked and obvious, but he's lost...Somewhere in his darkness. His eyes are wide and bleak and tortured. I can soothe him, join him briefly in the darkness and bring him into the light.<br /><br />The sample from chapter 26, sums up the book. Anna is so full life, so innocent. Christian however is a darker soul. Has had a bad childhood before he was adopted. When he is around Anna we get to see glimpse of him laughing. Anna, and Christian share many first together in this book. I loved the book, but didn't care for the end. It does however end perfect to set up for the next book in the series.<br />*********************************************<br />This is a series of three books and should be read in order starting with 50 shades of grey. This part of the review is for fifty shades darker.  In this book I loved how Anna's and Christian's relationship grew. I really enjoyed their fun email, and text banter.  The suspense to the story will keep you holding your breath. In this book Anna has to deal with her boss who is a pervert. Christian and Anna have to deal with Christian's crazy exes. The romance between Christian and Anna is off the charts Hot and steamy. This is an adult book for 18 and older.<br /><br />In the past Christian never did romance or love. He had subs to satisfy his needs. He met Anna in the first book. Anna took his breath away. He asked Anna to be his sub. Anna left him before she signed his contract. The second book starts out with both being miserable. They both want more. Christian offers Anna a relationship. This is new to both of them, so they experience a lot of first together. Anna is afraid she can't be everything Christian needs. Christian assures her, she is everything he will ever need.<br />Sample from chapter 9 - \\"Do you have any idea how exquisite your scent s, Ana? It's irresistible.\\" His words do what they always do, Flame my blood, quicken my pulse, and he trails his nose down my throat, across my breasts, kissing me reverentially as he does. \\"You are so beautiful,\\" He murmurs,<br /><br />Sample from chapter 12 - \\"Anastasia, It's not like that. I don't like talking about this shit. I've lived in a bubble for years with nothing affecting me and not having to justify myself to anyone. She's always been there as a confidante. And now my past and my future are colliding in a way I never thought possible.\\" I glance at him and he's staring at me, his eyes wide. \\"I never thought I had a future with anyone, Anastasia. You give me hope and have me thinking about all sorts of possibilities.\\" He drifts off.<br />**************************************************<br />This is a series of 3 books that should be read in order. Fifty shades of gray, fifty shades darker, and fifty shades free. This series is for adults 18 years and up for it is an erotic romance. The sex is red hot, and the romance is sweet. This part of the review is for the book fifty shades free.<br /><br />Here are some samples of my favorite parts of book three.<br /><br />Sample from chapter 7 - I kiss his chest, and we lie silently watching as the x-files finish and the commercials come on. \\"It's been a heavenly three weeks. Car chases and fires and psycho ex - bosses notwithstanding. Like being in our own private bubble,\\" I mutter dreamily.<br /><br />Sample from chapter 8 - \\"You've got to let me make my own decisions, take my own risks, and make my own mistakes, and let me learn from them. I need to walk before I can run, Christian, don't you see? I want some independence. That's what my name means to me.\\" There, that's what I wanted to say this afternoon. \\"You feel railroaded?\\" He whispers. I nod. He closes his eyes, agitated. \\"I just want to give you the world, Ana, everything and anything you want. And save you fromit, too. Keep you safe. But I also want everyone to know your mine.<br /><br />Sample from chapter 10<br /> \\"What do you need?\\" ask Mrs. Jones, stepping forward. She's recovered her composure. \\"Something to restrain him, cord or rope,\\" Ryan replies. Cable ties. I flush as memories of the night before invade my mind. Reflexively, I rub my wrists and glance quickly down at them. No, no bruising. Good. \\"I have something. Cable ties. Will they do? All eyes turn to me. \\"Yes ma'am. Perfect.\\" Sawyer says, serious and straight faced. I want the floor to swallow me up, but I turn and head to our bedroom. Sometimes you just have to brazen things out. Perhaps it's the combination of fear and alcohol making me audacious.<br /><br />Sample from chapter 13 - He tips my chin up with his finger, leans down, and kisses me tenderly. \\"So are you.\\" I smile. \\"Though I feel like I cheated. I didn't have to wait for you at all.\\" He grins. \\"Am I that much of a prize?\\"  \\"Christian, you are the state lottery, the cure for cancer, and the three wishes from Aladdin's lamp all rolled into one.\\" He raises a brow. \\"When will you realize this?\\" I scold him.<br />Sample from chapter 23 - \\"Oh ana,\\" Christian whispers, his voice anguished and pained. \\"I thought I'd lost you. Then I thought I'd lost you again. Seeing you lying on the ground, pale and cold and unconscious, it was all my worst fears realized. And now here you are, brave and strong...giving me hope. Loving me after all that I've done. \\"Yes, I do love you Christian desperately. I always will.\\" Gently taking my head between his hands, he wipes my tears away with his thumbs. He gazes into my eyes, gray to blue, and all I see is his fear, and wonder, and love. \\"I love you, too,\\" He breathes. And he kisses me sweetly, tenderly, like a man who adores his wife.<br />********************************************<br /><br />After reading all three books I can't help but smile on thinking back to how Christian and Ana got together. Ana's roommate was sick, so Ana was volunteered to interview Christian (Mr. Gray) for Kate that worked on the student newspaper. After graduation Ana got drunk for the first time ever, and drunk dialed Christian...And this is how the story begins. Ana and Christian is a beautiful, and erotic romance.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|I hated this movie the first time I saw it...really hated it.  Everyone that I have talked to has agreed that this movie must be seen twice in order to be appreciated.  It's meant to be stupid, so just loosen up!
1475143389|5.0|Originally, I bought the book on Audible. I am Diabetic and hurt my ankle, so I needed to excercise to keep my sugar in check, thus decided to build muscle to help burn the sugar. I am a puddle jumper truck driver. Meaning I go home every day so am able to work out. I have listened to the book several times and learned something new or different each time. So I decided since there is so much infomation I went ahead and purchased the book and highlighted all the information I wanted to remember (which is alot). This book is great for beginners or for those already working out and don't seem to be getting any results. This will explain why and how to alter or change your routine. I would suggest this book to anyone interested in getting bigger, stronger or leaner or all of the above. At the end of the book he gives a web site for more info, of which he requests your email, which obviously I did. He then sent me an email to see if I had any questions and then another a few weeks later to check up on me. Mike is legitimate in regards in wanting to help people. Just get the book and try it and see if the rest of the 700+ reviews are wrong. Stay strong & focused.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a well written, perfectly cast series. The characters are believable and lovable (the spinster sisters and Mrs. Brown are my favorites) and the plots are great. I binged all four seasons in two weeks and I was sorry to see it end.

I started the first book on a Friday night and by Sunday had completed all three books.  I would definitely recommend to anyone whom enjoyed the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy.
078322947X|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out.  I loved it then and I still love it now after all these years later.  It's such a thriller and I'm a big fan of Roy Scheider.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device does work as advertized but not on iPad and iPhone. I would like to see iit work from Chrome browser on all devices.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy the challenge of this. I feel like it is good for my brain.I am going to look for some similar apps now!
B009CCBCU4|5.0|This novel is an idea that hits the first page running ... and the pace never quits....<br /><br />In central Mexico, at a time when there were Aztecs--but shortly before the Aztec empire came to be--there were a number of tribes around Lake Texcoco, and some of them had created what might as well be called city states, for they indeed had cities, with stone buildings, plazas, pyramids.... One of these cities was Tenochtitlan, built on an island, home of the Aztecs.<br /><br />Coyotl, teen-age son of the ruler of another of these city-states--Texcoco--wanders into the hills, where he accidentally meets, and befriends, a hereditary enemy, the eponymous \\"highlander,\\" considered a barbarian by his own people. Kuini, the highlander, also manages to meet Iso, Coyotl's adventurous sister by one of his father's other wives. And from there, their three fates become entwined ... as a war for power begins among the peoples surrounding the lake that built the Aztec civilization. But I'll leave it to Saadia's talent to take you through the twists of this tale....<br /><br />One of the intriguing things about the \\"New World\\" is that native empires had recently formed (and were expanding), when the advent of Europeans destroyed them (the Maya excepted). In Mexico, the conquering Spaniards also systematically destroyed the codices (picture writing) of the Aztecs (though not all of them) essentially erasing much of their culture and their past for the future. Which means that Saadia had far less than she might have to work with, recreating that amazing time and place. Yet what she brings to life is a wonderful exploration of this \\"pre Aztec\\" world, new to historical fiction, for to my knowledge she is the first to do so.<br /><br />The Highlander is a great read, tautly plotted, the characters colorful. I'm greatly looking forward to the rest of the series....
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I had a Kindle given to me - one of the older ones with a keyboard on it and came home to fine the screen broke.  I was in the middle of reading an awesome book so I downloaded Kindle for Iphone but wanted a bigger area to read so I bought the Trio Stealth... It took me a while to figure out what I needed to do but finally got Kindle loaded and all my books - AWESOME  still figuring it out but I love it so far.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|it was action packed and all around a great movie for the average movie watcher. i would recommend it for sure.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|aMOL is the culminating book in the series with about 1/3 of it dedicated to the Last Battle.  It is an exciting final chapter to the WOT story.  The pacing is not perfect, there was definitely some slow moments but it really picks up steam, especially towards the end.  The Last Battle itself manages to exist on an epic scale while still seeming a little too overly simplistic.  I enjoyed the closing of most of the character arcs and decision making, however there were a few characters that agitated me to no end (cough..Elayne).  If you enjoyed the rest of the books then this is definitely worth a read.
B007G51UV0|4.0|This board is nice and it has good support for pretty much everything you would want. It has plenty of places to connect extra fans, extra USB 2.0/3.0 ports, etc.  The only downside to the board is the built in heat sinks that it has on things like the chipset, etc. These heat sinks caused some issues for me in terms of fan placement in a midsized case.  If you install into a full sized ATX case, I don't think that this would be an issue.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It's fun till I run out of lives and refuse to buy them. I do suggest it though if you like uno. US there's no clean up lol
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book left me speechless. I'm not even able to come up with the accurate words to justify the greatness of this book. It not like any other book I've ever read. It goes readers such a different understanding of cancer and the people who suffer from it's harsh symptoms. It doesn't romanticize cancer to make you feel sorry for the characters. It makes you realize that they are regular people, just like you and me, who experience the same things we do and want to live a normal life.<br /><br />While this book is written with young/teen readers in mind I never realized this until I read reviews after I read the book. It's content is emotionally mature, but an easy read. This is probably one of the best books I've ever read. This is my first book to review, and if I could give it 6 stars I would!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I actually sat through the whole thing without getting bored or thinking I have better things to be doing at the moment. It hooks you. It's terribly sad in many parts but the horse (Joey) just keeps plugging through - it all comes together in the end so wait for it. War is hell and this movie really shows it as such so be prepared for that. 100% recommend for anyone that loves a good drama with many heroes throughout.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|The Diary of a Wimpy Kid are by no means &#34;great American Classics&#34;, but they are entertaining to read.  This is a book that I am comfortable letting my 6 year old son read.  He frequently is laughing out loud at something funny in the book, and he enjoys re-telling the story to me in his own words.
B001TH16DI|5.0|It brought back many memories and reminded me of what a great series it was. A perfect gift to receive.
0802473156|5.0|I am very happy that I purchased this book. The shipping was quick and the book was in great condition. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and have shared many of the concepts with friends and family. I recommend it to all ages!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I'm fairly surprised at all of the gushing reviews.  I mean, I like it, but it's very limited in what it can do.  You can stream YouTube and Netflix and Google Play and sometimes videos from your browser (if they don't use Silverlight) but it's not a \\"screen mirroring\\" type functionality that can just cast whatever is on your screen to your TV.  You can't stream a powerpoint presentation or hook it up to Hulu.<br /><br />So basically it's a Roku that costs less and does less.<br /><br />BUT...it's portable.  It fits in your pocket.  It fits in your change pocket, even.  It's not much bigger than a bluetooth earpiece.  I like it because I can stick it in my pocket, go to work and plug it into the TV so we can all watch some YouTube videos or something on Netflix while we eat lunch.  I imagine if I took it with me on a trip it would be an easy way to get my Netflix account streaming on the hotel TV (if they have open HDMI ports anyway).<br /><br />Setup is very easy.  You just need a good wifi connection that can be shared with your casting device (your phone or your laptop, etc) and start the app and follow the steps.<br /><br />It works great; it does what it says it does; it's cheap; it's portable; but it doesn't do as much as you're probably hoping.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I am having so much fun playing this game. Would highly recommend this as a great exercise for your brain. Good luck putting down.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A very good read and an amazing story of faith, triumph, and the power of the human spirit.  Whether in a training environment or the rigors of combat the American combat veteran embodies the words of General Douglas MacArthur:  duty, honor, and country.  The power of prayer is truly amazing...thanks for not giving up...Marcus thanks for telling your stories and thanks for honoring the lost brothers in arms and the afghans who sacrificed so much to save your life.
B00000JPH6|5.0|hello:<br /><br />this is a very good and beautiful movie, my children like it very much, the old fight between good and dark forces<br /><br />regards
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the book and the way each chapter switched back and forth between the two main character.  It kept me thoroughly involved and hated to put it down.  BUT, I did not like the ending, I was hoping for something more or definitely a different outcome.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|If I had any doubts as to the brutality and thoughtlessness of the industrial food chain they have been put to rest by this book.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|The product was perfect.  As a matter of fact there were parts of the movie left out on TV that were included on the DVD.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I don't care if the character is reminiscent of the Jack Reacher stories; I like the Lee Child series.  This Baldacci novel stood on its own and was a pleasure to read.  There is nothing wrong with more than one kick-a&& military cop in the literary world.  I'll read another book with Puller as the protagonast.
B00846REIS|3.0|thsi book isgood butas a Christian Grey person, this book was far to similiar. probaly wouldve been better if hadnt read the 50 shadeds series
B000HF0IIC|5.0|I saw this movie before and liked it so I rented it for my 8 year old grandsons to see. It was great.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Always a good read,Austen transcends time with heartfelt and beautiful language. It doesn't matter how many times I read this book, I still laugh and enjoy the language and characters. She sure had a great gift for social commentary.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|Perfect image and sound quality (and there is a stereo track for those who don't have a 5.1 set, which is great, because a 5.1 on a stereo device make the characters' voices not loud enough when there is music or loud sound effects).<br />The bonus are interesting and funny (I laughed like hell watching Good Morning Storybrooke)<br /><br />Waiting for season 3 ! Can't wait !!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This item never appeared for download to phone or Kindle and I had totally forgotten about it I was disappointed
B0040HO01Y|4.0|While this series is of different classes of the common folk rather than the nobility, the stories ans characters are fascinating! Love it.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men is a very quintessential Steinbeck story. It has a lot of the themes of Steinbeck's other stories in \\"seed form\\". Such as the isolation of life, the essential communion between man and land, the potentially predatory nature of women, and the bitterness of events.<br /><br />In this John Steinbeck story, we follow the short tale of George and Lenny. Two friends who stick together in a cruel world, only to be eventually crushed by it's oppressive weight.<br /><br />All in all, it's a pretty good story and one of the best ways to be introduced to Steinbeck.
1417618108|5.0|I read this years ago and then the films came out so I decided to read them again. I almost forgot how good they were, the movies have taken over the brand. I think this was the first, if not only, book series I've read about this kind of 'CIA operative going against his boss' theme that isn't about money or his parents being murdered, etc. When you think of spy books, you think of Jason Bourne.
B00AEFZ6V4|4.0|When I received this movie there was a chip in the case and when it broke it fell inside the box and dislodged the disk from where it is normally held. So during shipping the disk received a lot of scratches I thought about returning it but decided to play it first and it still works perfectly fine. It was cheap and the movie worked well I was still very happy with this!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I have played this game twice a day or more for w3ks now. It's been fun and entertaining game until it reset me to zero today.I went from having most everything I wanted to starting over again. THIS is the second time ans seems to be correlated with a change in cities. THIS TIME I don't wAnt to start from scratch and M giving up the game. Thanks for the months of entertainment I had
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I love the series, please don't let it end, It is an all around wonderful series and besy I have seen in a long time and I am an od lady .
B00CXQL828|4.0|Amazingly not as shreddy as I thought it would be but still has a lot of killer riffs __ as one would expect for all the talent !!
B002KGEORM|5.0|As the seasons go on the show just gets better and better with more twists and turns, with more things going crazy and sideways it will keep you guessing and wanting more.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I think this show is awesome. Lots of action lots of think through wonder what's going to happen next and it will make you do a double take and say (&#34;WHAT?!?!?! I never would have guessed!&#34;)<br />If you are looking for a good series to keep you wanting more this is it.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Good movie, but kind of left me with a less than satisfactory ending. Don't want to spoil anything so I will say no more than it was kind of predictable yet still worth watching as long as expectations are not to high. That guy McConaughey is great.
0061900656|5.0|We gave this as a gift to our grandson upon the arrival of his new brother. It is written for parents to read to their son and as such was warmly received by my grandson. His parents were impressed how much he liked the book so I must recommend the purchase to anyone in the market.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|A quick,review of the new google Chromecast device.  It has a very  limited capability with the iPad,  Essentially it will interface with Netflix, YouTube  and a couple of google apps.  However, the casting will NOT work at all with Chrome from your iPad.  It gives you a very definite error message, to the affect,  this device, &#34;if we have any say about it at all&#34; will NEVER work with Chromecast!!!!  You get the idea.  However,  it will work with you lap top and potentially, although I can not vouch for it, non iPads,  smart phones and maybe some other devices.<br /><br />The laptop using Google Chrome and an add on for casting works, surprisingly well, what you see on your computer, anything , can be cast to the tv screen.  However, there is a one second lag, between audio and video.  So don't count on watching Hulu or other video products other than YouTube and Netflix with out bad lip syncing.  Looking at your Facebook picture file on a 60 inch is quite nice.<br /><br />So if you thought as I did there would be some compatibility between your iPad and the device,  that's not in the cards.  But using your lap top or non Apple  product you might have more luck.<br /><br />Was it a good 35 dollar investment.  Perhaps, but it could be so much better.  I guess we just  have to wait and see.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movies was very entertaining, clever and funny!  Their magic shows were very exciting and dramatic, but my favorite part is how they were able to &#34;pull it off&#34;.  It's not a deep-thought emotional provoking kind a of movie.  there is one scene that I didn't think fit, I guess it was included to add some sort of mystical element. A good movie to have friends over and watch together.  I would watch it again.  Download was easy with no problems.
B000RUAR5G|3.0|Today's animated films do a better job balancing appropriate content for children while entertaining adults.  This movie does the former very well, that latter...not so much.  That said, my six year old loved it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful scenery, excellent actors, great story line with history as a backdrop and always full of surprises.  What more could one ask?
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Another Longmire book and it was interesting to see what parts of the book they put in the TV show!
B009329Y30|4.0|Zac Efron, that's who's lucky!  He's a good looking kid and I hope he stays clean, not like some other young actors.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Definitely a benefit if you're taking college classes with books online!  Good app and works good too!  I recommend it!
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|Hilarious geometry based game. Put a tennis ball in the face of someone that you've always wanted to. A clown? A cop? A hipster? A lawyer?It's a riot! Also, I'm on the 5th level and it has never crashed, which is a huge bonus.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|You'll get just as lost in this intricate story as you did with his other novels. It touches your soul, I promise.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|While I love comic books, I'm typically wary of their TV or Movie versions. But the creators of Arrow did a great job putting together a (mostly) solid cast and great story lines. Many of the characters are based on their comic book counterparts, although it seems Season 2 will move away from that trend. Serious hats off to actor Stephen Amell (Oliver Queen). He does a great job with the physicality of the role and truly brings Arrow to life.
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|I liked it! The storyline resolved pretty well for only having 2 seasons. Hope to see Eliza Dushku in another series! Perhaps the new Sarah Michelle Gellar show will be good...
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|This was a very nice album. Some songs had to grow on me, but I loved the songs... Cole world has done it again. One of the best of our generation. Much love here.

B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|This game is fun and easy to learn. I don't like how you have to buy coins, but u can earn gems. You should be able to earn the coins also.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Great show for me. not a patient person I enjoy watching from start to end the whole season. worth the wait.

B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|Kinda just blahh got to write all toghther notes comees out in small headline retarded way basic too.so yeah blah
B008JFUPK8|4.0|The character of Superman is a very hard character to portray in film. Everyone has preconceived notions about him, as well as ideas in their mind about how he should act and behave. Snyder's portrayal and Cavill's delivery of the character make this film excellent. The Superman created in \\"The Man of Steel\\" is one that can be related to, (as much as one can). Keeping the original creators meanings behind Superman in the film and the interactions between Clark and his earth parents and his interactions with his space dad, just add to this movie's greatness.
B009UOI9UK|5.0|A B+W rubber hood ($15.00) makes more sense. However the esthetics of this hood are impressive and considering the price of the camera, it is worth the expense.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Damian Stevenson's \\"The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal\\" follows up his first \\"Fleming\\" novel, \\"Operation Armada\\" with a twist.  As the Allies are grinding towards victory in World War II, the British government learns of a plot by a cabal of German officers and industrialists to overthrow Hitler and replace him with a saner, more competent leader - and potentially prolong the war indefinitely.  So, Ian Fleming, agent 17F, is dispatched on the strangest mission he could imagine: to save the life of the Fuhrer.<br /><br />The book takes Fleming all across Europe, and eventually to a showdown in the heart of Africa as he attempts to infiltrate \\"Parsifal,\\" the group that seeks to create a new and even deadlier fourth reich.  Stevenson describes everything in loving detail, capturing the feel of the James Bond novels while at the same time laying the groundwork for his fictional Fleming to become their creator once the war is over.<br /><br />Everything you'd expect in a Bond novel is here: girls, gadgets, Bondian quips, exotic locations and a memorable adversary.  It's a lot of fun, and highly recommended.
B000005AYL|3.0|The sleeve of this record is not what Amazon has displayed as the main picture.  The user uploaded image is what you will actually be recieving, a plain black sleeve with sticker on it.  I was a little bummed when I opened up the box and thought I would pass it on.  For $8 bucks you can't really complain though.  I have not had a chance to take a listen to the quality of the record yet but I will updated once I have.
B004WQ2L9G|5.0|Set includes Barenboim's peerless recording of the Wagner Paraphrases, one of the greatest piano recordings of all time.  I'd buy this for tat disk alone.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Easy to read and understand. Its a good book  to encourage people to be an Enterprenuer.<br />I would highly recommended it.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said?  This album, to put it simply, is outstanding in virtually every way.  The songs sound like they are from the Necroticism/Heartwork era (my favorite era of Carcass), while still sounding completely fresh and new.  Bill Steer's riffs, melodies and solos are blistering throughout the entire album.  Jeff Walker's vocals are classic Carcass - disturbing and funny at the same time.  While I miss Ken Owen, and it's a tragedy that he can't perform anymore, Dan Wilding's drums blew me away on this album.  There are so many memorable songs on Surgical Steel, but \\"Cadaver Pouch Conveyor System\\", \\"Noncompliance To ASTM F 899-12 Standard\\", \\"Unfit For Human Consumption\\" and \\"Captive Bolt Pistol\\" really stood out from the rest.  Surgical Steel will go down as an instant death metal classic from a band that showed the world 20 years ago how it's done.  If I could only buy one album in 2013, this is the one I would buy.

080701429X|2.0|I came to this book interested in reading an Auschwitz survivors' understanding of our human need to look for 'meaning' in life events.<br /><br />Reading it I was reminded of an incident that happened in my own childhood in Germany in the 1970's which I would briefly like to relate. I was fifteen and living on a British Army camp in Dortmund. My parents held a party for the other officers and their wives and my elder brother and I were were given 50 DMs or something to act as waiters.<br />I can't remember now if:<br />a.) I witnessed the conversation AND heard my Dad discussing it afterwards,<br />or<br />b.) if I only witnessed my Dad discussing it afterwards,<br />probably the latter.<br /><br />But, anyway, an interesting and quite heated conversation ensued at the end of the evening involving my father and the wife of the Colonel (I think). Everybody by this time was 'well-oiled' on alchohol and inhibitions were relaxing.<br />The Colonel's wife was German. And somehow the topic of conversation came around to where in Germany she was from. It turned out that she was from some area where there had been a concentration camp during the war. So then the discussion came onto the persecution of the Jews in the forties and the alleged policy of mass murder in the concentration camps. My Dad had wanted to know why the ordinary Germans hadn't done anything to stop it or to speak up about the exterminations. She was adamant that she herself did not now about that policy of the mass gassings. She also insisted that no-one she knew, knew of it either.<br /><br />My dad was quite incredulous, and persisted that she must have known. They all must have known. How could they live so close and not have known?<br />In the morning he was going on about it, and that he couldn't get over that she was still denying that after all this time.<br />As an impressionable fifteen year old it made an impact on me and I naturally accepted my Father's view of that, ...and yet... (?) there was something that didn't quite sit right.<br /><br />Years later (summer holiday of 2011), having long forgotten this episode, I spent a few days lying out in the sun in the garden reading this biography of Viktor Frankl \\"Trotzdem Ja zum Leben sagen\\" (Man's Search for Meaning). I realised I had never read an eye-witness account of the biggest crime of the last century and I was also interested in the subject of how we apply meaning to our experiences. So I bought it online here from Amazon.<br />In the first half of the book Frankl (who was a psychiatrist) wrote of his experiences in WW2 as a Jew in concentration labour camps. As I read it I noticed he kept jumping between two contradictory viewpoints, sometimes in the space of a few pages.<br /><br />At some places he affirmed that all the Jews themselves knew that if they were going to Auschwitz, then they were destined for almost certain annihilation. And at other times he asserts that they didn't know.<br />At some places he asserts that he and other people upon arrival knew that they were getting segregated into lines for either gassing or for work, and at others he maintains that the people didn't know what the segregation was for.<br />That was confusing.<br /><br />At one point he states how he himself knew, as after being selected by Joseph Mengele \\"to the left for the gas chamber,\\" he relates how he \\"switched behind Mengele's back\\" to the right.<br /><br />Then there were other odd things. He says he got out of Auschwitz by volunteering as a doctor. He wrote that he left in a transportation of ill inmates taken to Bavaria in 1944.<br />The thought occurred: 'Ill Jewish inmates were not being gassed then? They were instead being transported out for medical care elsewhere?' That was a bit surprising.<br /><br />Then he wrote how in Bavaria he worked as a doctor treating ill inmates in a hospital camp in the typhus ward near Dachau.<br />I thought: 'Er... They were taking care of them? In 1944? Jews with Typhoid? Trying to cure them?'<br /><br />THEN after finishing the book I discovered that despite him giving the impression that he had been at Auschwitz for at the very least many months, that Frankl had in fact only been there for 3 or 4 days. :-o<br /><br />It was then that my curiosity was piqued and my research into this started. And it was then that I was reminded of the Colonel's wife (who had been a young girl at the time of these events) claiming that nobody knew what was going on in the camps.<br />So it was that I started to re-evaluate all this.<br /><br />How was she - and the other town residents- supposed to know about what was going on in the camps, if a camp inmate at Auschwitz (Frankl) couldn't make up his mind if he himself knew or not.<br /><br />And now after my research I find that she was right. She didn't know about the mass murder of jews at whatever camp she had lived by. THERE WERE NO extermination camps IN GERMANY. It is now accepted after many decades of misleading propaganda that ALL the alleged extermination camps were in what became Soviet occupied Poland. This is now a well attested statement of accepted historical fact. So... my Dad had been wrong to assume she was in denial. It turns out it was in fact he who had been.<br /><br />It was reading this book by Frankl and its obvious contradictions that started me looking more into this episode of history.<br /><br />Before I finish, I would like to make clear that the appalling number of fatalities at the wars end in those camps was clearly and obviously a terrible tragedy of epic proportions. I do not mean to minimise in any way the suffering of those poor people.<br />Its just that I now understand that a mythology HAS developed around that which I was not aware of before. A mythology that demonises the Germans unfairly via denial of some basic uncontested but little known or publicised facts. A mythology that has become a taboo topic that cannot be discussed in some parts of Europe under penalty of imprisonment, and in most of the western world without receiving public censure and rebuke.<br /><br />A mythology of which this book I now regard as a small contributing part. So I am am not sure exactly what rating to give it. Thus I give it only two stars...oid?

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this app at the request of my 6 year old granddaughter who thought it looked like fun. She was right. It is entertaining and teaches planning of your moves before you make them in order to maximize performance. Great for kids and adults. We had fun working together.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this to come out. I have seen every movie and never bought a single one in hopes that they would all come out in a Blu-Ray box set. Well finally my wish has been granted and I am so happy. I know not many people are fans of this, but I like the whole story of it all, and they are good movies to watch when there is nothing on cable, and football season is over.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Has an interesting storyline.  I enjoy the varied games within the story. Graphics are good and<br />there is adequate help throughout.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I loved this book, it was hilarious! The author drew the cats really really really well. I loved it so much
B004B8K2C8|5.0|Since I was first introduced to this show just a few months ago, I have been addicted. Every episode draws you in. The crimes are so complex and to finally understand them makes you want more!<br /><br />The modern Sherlock Holmes setting, I think, is one of the main aspects that makes this show popular. We're used to seeing industrial age Sherlock but with a 21st century twist, it interests viewers because we can definitely relate to a lot more in the story.<br /><br />Overall, fantastic series. I can't wait for Season 3!
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|...  And just FYI, This is the WORST MOVIE with the WORST ACTING EVER... If I could get my money back I would! Terrible, and Brad should be ashamed..! I will NEVER see another movie he puts his name on again...!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is as good as advertised. I love documentaries and this one is great. Unbelievable true story. I measure music,art,cinema, entertainment all the same...if it moves me. Buy it, watch, tell people about it. That's what will happen. Enjoy.
0345548981|5.0|Well written.  I loved this book and the message of being positive and the strive for balance, rather then perfection.  Also that he made it clear that each person's body is different and that we have to start to listen to our bodies.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I love this cd.  The entire cd is outstanding and the song is never lost with the incredible musicianship.  If you like hard rock with a little bit of blues mixed in, you will get hooked.  I highly recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was unable to put this book down although at many parts you want to do some self introspection.  It is very interesting as well as emotional demanding. All the what ifs in life become an essential part of the characters stories.  I recommend this book to all readers as well as book clubs.  It provides so many aspects of life.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game. It's so cute and it is fun. It's not time consuming so you can enjoy it throughout the day a little at a time. Good for any age.
B003Z0BWRM|3.0|I found this mildly entertaining but not riveting. It feels like this genre has been overdone and there is no true originality in these books. i much prefer The Daughter of Smoke and Bone and The Kiera Hudson series in this genre. I will not be continuing with the other books in this series.
1616550414|4.0|The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia is can't-miss reading for all devoted Zelda fans. This compendium is a celebration of the art and worldbuilding of a cherished franchise now in its 4th decade. The most significant revelation found here is the official multi-game timeline that ties the entire Zelda universe together. Fans have debated its structure--its very existence even--for years. The timeline's current form is a clever construction of parallel universes spanning countless generations.<br /><br />Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo have done a masterful job crafting and growing a brand that hopefully will last for decades to come.
B003477DVK|4.0|This is a very cute movie, suitable for all ages. I enjoyed the lack of strong language. Mind you, I swear myself on occasion, but too often in today's culture and conversation, harsh words are becoming commonplace. It doesn't lessen the pain they can cause. Watch this movie!
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|This is a great follow up to \\"\\"Peter: a Darkened Fairytale\\".  The poems are very imaginary with great style and writing.  I loved the novel \\"\\"Peter: a Darkened Fairytale\\" and these poems are a nice follow up to it and to Peter's adventures.  One of my favorites in this book was \\"Finding Fingle\\". I look forward to reading more by this author and to learn what his imagination will offer us next.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|it works great for me, setup didnt work from m computer for some reason so i did it from my phone in minutes. youtube is great because there are no ads, netflix works great but since i change servers to watch netflix in different countries the chromecast wont allow it. And for the google play music im not allowed to play music that is already on my phone is that is kinda of a downer to me too. And i never use google play video so hat is useless to me. I wont they keep supporting it and dont just forget about it because it has alot of potential. If not then i might have just wasted 35 dollars and 3 months waiting for it to arrive since everyone wants one. Other than that its a great device. (better and cheaper than the nexus q)
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Really fun and time consuming. I play it alot!!! I REALLY SUGGEST THIS APP! Me and my friend LOVE it
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The characters believably portray the younger version of those we grew up with and are a joy to watch.<br />The movie itself was exciting, well written and full of action.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this story. The Characters were strong and interesting, and the story line was compelling with a strong narrative drive. From one scene to the next, I couldn't stop turning the pages. This was a fun-filled, excellent read, and I'm happy that I took the time to check it out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The book was a little racy but enjoyed reading about these characters, and looking forward to the next book in the series
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|I could not wait to see this movie because of the hype.  However, it was very disappointing and did not think it rose to it's reputation.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|His books have opened a whole new world for me, did not know that Darpa even existed.  Always anxious for the next book to come out.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This was a good movie to watch for the family.  We laughed and even cried a bit.  Barbara and Seth were a great team.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|That boy Jermaine Cole always comes with the heat. Definitely did not disappoint on this one. I think I like it even more than his 1st album. 4 1/2 Stars
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I adore Lana Del Rey. This album has a slightly different feel than her Born to Die album, but it's really amazing! Her cover of Blue Velvet is....UNF!
0307476073|5.0|I heard so much about Wild that I picked up a copy at the airport and read it on the plane. I had a hard time believing how naïve she was at first but I must confess at the same time I couldn't put it down. Sometimes in our lives we can feel lost or abandoned for different reasons but Strayed tells her story painfully well of how she was able to find her way (although she didn't think so at the time).<br />This book would be great for discussion at a women's book club. My only regret is that I would have loved to have seen a picture of the \\"monster\\" that she lugged throughout her journey.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I was a skeptical fan... I know he can rap but wasn't sure what the complete album would deliver. He came with a top album of the year. There was also a lot of growth from his previous work.  The deluxe edition has a 2nd cd with a darker vibe that was mind blowing.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|You can watch basic clips on this however it seems like there is a time limit on how long they can be.  All the clips on here are very short.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series keeps getting better. Great book, couldn't put the book down! Finished in a week. :) I usually never buy books but this is one that I would read again
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this game. It is very cute and brings in many things from the movie.  It is a pretty simple game similar to a temple run-however it is something to play if you don't want to use a lot of brain power.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really like this game. The hidden aspect of the game  is amazing. I would definitely recommend this game to others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It keeps my baby cousin busy and me too. It's never blurred and is a lovely game. I recommend this to anyone. Especially children though
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I like how this app suggests moving things to the sd card & works efficiently in the background,  doesn't use much memory and doesn't:::: bother you much.
B00BMKH5NW|2.0|It was  just an okay book but I just didn't connect with it like I did with her other two books. I've never been into the world of fan fiction and I kept waiting for Cath to realize that she was better than that - that it was something that she was hiding behind.<br /><br />Rowell had an interesting premise and a opportunity to start something that had a YA flair to it and turn it into something more and she wastes it. What could have been a really beautiful modern coming of age story just sort of turned out to be weekend pop culture mind candy. I had hopes that Rowell would mature as a writer herself and really dig in for something meaningful instead of going for the easy YA win. It didn't happen.<br /><br />***Spoilers after this ****<br /><br />The setup is Cath's supposed to be this incredibly gifted writer but she we never really see her leave the easy stuff behind and really challenge herself, it's alluded to at the very end but we only get the immature fan fic as readers. She takes the easy way out - the road more traveled - and we're supposed to happy about that?<br /><br />I thought maybe she'd finish \\"Carry On\\" and realize it was a closed chapter in her life forever and realize it was a crutch and an excuse not to really work at her writing and she would be free of it from that point forward and start to grow and that would be where the story took us on that journey but sadly no.<br /><br />I didn't read the fanfic inserts - that just seemed too tedious. Honestly I don't understand why she made up a whole other world rather than just setting the whole thing in the world of Harry Potter fandom, which she was clearly imitating - where their legal issues with that? It would have wrung a whole lot more true.<br /><br />Her made up fandom just seemed like a lame rip off - especially considering that she mentions Harry Potter in the book so she's having us try and buy into a reality where the Harry Potter series has been trumped and surpassed by another set of books about a magical school and magicians and a chosen boy who has to fight the ultimate evil - that were all published at roughly the same time period the Potter books were. Potter was 1997-2007. Her fandom's 8th book is published in 2011 but she references that they were at least 8 years in the making if I remember right so that would have put some of the publishing simultaneously. It's just too hard to buy that another similar franchise would have gotten off the ground like that.<br /><br />Loved the Reagan character and wish there was more meat put there... if we could have sacrificed 1/3 of the words dedicated to the boyfriends smile.. Seriously he's so unmemorable of a character I can't even think of his name and I just finished the book but there are at least 10,000 words talking about his smile - we know little to nothing else about him other than that though, evidently he's all cheerfulness and good teeth.<br /><br />And this book did something else that's a pet peeve - it's set in a static period of time. One academic year. But 90% of the book is set in 50-60% of the year and then March, April and May are all handled in 2 chapters. All of a sudden all loose ends tied up neatly 1 2 3.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book I really did and for about the first half of it I thought I was going to. I was excited to see where it was going - but then it just went no where. Cath started out this really interesting damaged writer hiding behind her fan fic and personality quirks forced into a new situation that was going to challenge her in all new ways but then she just sort of suddenly morphed into at typical college co-ed that found a boyfriend second semester of her freshman year and that just fixed everything. No more damage, no more quirks, no more hiding - just fall in love and life fixes itself right up.<br /><br />Please...

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game play and excellent graphics Hard to put down New challenges every week makes re play value a plus A must have game for any collection
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I saw the movie first - not the same story. Very good account of the world turned upside down. Great read
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really keeps the grandchildren entertained on trips and other times when boredom takes over. Enjoyed by ages 7 to 12 years of age and maybe more.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I used to collect magazine clippings of my favorite places, spaces, recipes and ideas. Pinterest has made by little folders of clippings obsolete as well as providing access to more topics than I could have accessed on my own!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The movie was great entertainment for an evening at home together. Has characters who are clever, fast thinking, and humorous in some events.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|awesome game something to do when I'm bord never gets old I loved it hope you like it to you would get it but when your car clips over you can hear the guy neck crack I could not get over that it sounded weird lolz
1451695195|5.0|I fell so in love with this book, I got it right away and started reading and finish the book in 2 days!
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|I miss JM like he was ten years ago, his style has changed a lot and I am a fan, but just let down a bit on this one.<br />No cool random lyrics like his first few albums, more background music to me. The more you listen, the more you like it, but I'd prefer to like it right away. The best song is the single, paper doll-down hill from there.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|It was like one long amazing trailer for a film. It left me unfulfilled and asking a lot of questions.
1594200823|5.0|Required Reading for Son's College Course, he says the book is interesting, which is good because he's not big on reading. I personally am looking forward to reading it after he's done. Got a great deal on this book on Amazon as usual.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game, it's alot more in-depth then other search &amp; find games, I have spent some money on it but that's because I'm impatient at times otherwise game does last a while, it's worth it, play it!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is so much fun and it works you mind  l have a lot of fun playing. The game is so colorful and bright
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Im from Australia and recently went to Warner Bros studios and did the tour. We went to the set of Pretty Little Liars and i felt so out of it as I had never heard of the show. When i arrived at my friends place to stay I saw PLL was on netflicks so thought I'd watch an episode so i could see the set i visited. I was hooked and have been staying up till 2am watching the series. I have loved it so much that i ordered the 3 seasons available and will wait impatiently for season 4 to be released on DVD. I love it.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I don't know what it is about me and &#34;blockbuster&#34; books-but this one failed to grab me ( I was one of only a few in my circle not to get into the 50 shades, twilight and Harry Potter ones either!). I just didn't get it-I didn't care about the characters at all and struggled to finish the book. If asked to sum it up in one word-meh!
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|I've been listening to Nine Inch Nails since early 1991 when I first heard Pretty Hate Machine. For the next several years I was all about NIN. Yes I loved other artists across several genres of music (from \\"Industrial\\" to UK Shoegazing) but NIN was the stuff. Everything about NIN seemed so cool, from their incredible live shows to the cataloging of the releases as \\"HALO\\" numbers, the machine sounds permeating the music, think of the industrial sounds present in \\"Reptile\\". But as we went through Y2K I began to listen a little less, the newer music didn't grab me the same way that everything did from Pretty Hate Machine through to The Downward Spiral and all its remixes did. I really wanted to fall in love with The Fragile and there are still times when I pull out the CD and listen to the tracks I do enjoy, but on the whole it wasn't the same anymore.<br /><br />In 2005 when With Teeth came out I enjoyed the album, particularly the DualDisc ([[ASIN:B0008ISM40 With Teeth (Advisory) (Digi)]]) which contains a fantastic 24/48 5.1 high resolution surround mix. If you have a surround system and like NIN but don't have this DualDisc, pick it up! Even without a DVD-Audio player you can still listen to the surround mix in Dolby Digital although the fidelity is definitely reduced. As an aside, the amazing 5.1 mix of The Downward Spiral is also available as both a DualDisc ([[ASIN:B0006FFRW0 Downward Spiral (DVD-A Dualdisc)]]) and a Super Audio CD ([[ASIN:B00066N8JS Downward Spiral (SACD Hybrid) (Deluxe Edition)]]). While I enjoyed the music, the end result was similar to The Fragile, it didn't grab me musically by the nuts and not let go. I enjoyed the live shows changing at this time too, but missed the Self Destruct tour of 1994 which I thought had a greater impact. This sounded like a less industrial more grungy NIN live and I didn't think the older songs worked in that environment.<br /><br />Later in the decade both Year Zero and The Slip were the albums I took to the least. I did like a couple tracks, In This Twilight is awesome, but the magic of early NIN for me wasn't there. I saw the NIN/JA tour in 2009 and definitely enjoyed hearing some of the stuff from The Slip moreso live than on the album and that's always good, the live shows always kept me interested in what TR was doing.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2013 and I got excited for three reasons: 1) NIN were back! 2) There was new music!! 3) The first single sounded more like the NIN I really liked. Then two weeks before release date the announcement that really blew my mind - there would be an AUDIOPHILE MASTERING of the new album if you pre-ordered from the official NIN website. YES! In this day and age when so much music is destroyed by the loudness wars it was great to hear Trent was listening, as certainly there was lots of negative feedback over the massive amounts of dynamic range compression found on the 2010 Pretty Hate Machine remaster. So on September 3rd, 2013, I downloaded my \\"audiophile mastering\\" of Hesitation Marks in high resolution 24/48 2.0 WAVE files. To my dismay when I compared the waveforms and the dynamic range logs, it appeared there was on average only a single decibel difference. I wondered if we were being stitched up? This is definitely not what audiophiles would consider an audiophile mastering. The original 1989 mastering by Barry Diament (famous for his amazing masterings of Bob Marley and Led Zeppelin) of Pretty Hate Machine, THAT is an audiophile mastering. Anyway, I was pretty dismayed, but I did want to hear the album obviously to see about the music...<br /><br />WOW! This is Nine Inch Nails for those of us who fell in love with the early stuff. Talk about a return to form. This album is amazing from start to finish, not a bad track on here. I feel like it's a cross between Pretty Hate Machine, The Downward Spiral and perhaps some of his instrumental work and scoring with Atticus with a touch of Underworld mixed in, who are the best electronica unit out there. There are HARMONIES on here for God's sake, ha. There is plenty of minor keys here and lots of dissonance, but the resolve is as good as ever. Take the resolve from the cacophonous first chorus from \\"Everything\\" into the harmonies of the second verse \\"Wave Goodbye\\" - you can feel yourself breathe a sigh of relief as the tension dissipates.<br /><br />I have listened through the album now seven times and each time I love the music more and more. I can't analyze the lyrics much at the moment but in time I'm sure that will happen, this album doesn't feel like it's going anywhere anytime soon. I tried to think of my five favourite tracks yesterday and came up with:<br /><br />1. In Two<br />2. Find My Way<br />3. I Would For You<br />4. Copy of A<br />5. All Time Low<br /><br />I suppose that could change at any minute, but boy it was hard to pick an order. The music is just amazing throughout.<br /><br />The question on how to get the most dynamic version of this album appears to be answered by one word - vinyl. The vinyl for Hesitation Marks was cut by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering, but unfortunately it was pressed at United Record Pressing in Nashville who just seem to have so many off centred pressings and noisy vinyl. The European pressing which you can order through Amazon UK or Amazon Canada was done at GZVinyl in the Czech Republic, they have their own issues but I find their vinyl is usually quiet. Whether it's the same Chris Bellman cut I haven't found out yet, I might put a question into BGM and see if I get a response and update. I may just go with the US pressing and if it's off centre or noisy send it back to Amazon US and order from Amazon UK.<br /><br />The worst part about the loudness wars is, we know the lack of dynamics can't be baked into the mixes. You can go to the ninremixes (dot com) website and download the multitracks for the entire Year Zero and The Slip album, as well as tracks from the NIN/JA sampler (Jane's Addiction's Chip Away for example), tracks from Pigface, How To Destroy Angels, Burn, and a couple tracks from With Teeth. If you add the individual wave files to Audacity and mix and render them, then compare them to the album version from the CD, it's night and day! The multitracks have their dynamics intact and on decent hifi playback equipment the music really comes alive.<br /><br />There is a massive amount of low end on this album and clearly the audiophile mastering does present an ever so slightly more open sound on most of the tracks, but hopefully someday we'll get a true audiophile mastering to enjoy this masterpiece in all its dynamic glory. For those listening on the go in iPods with inexpensive in ear buds, or listening in the car on a factory system with lots of ambient sounds from traffic, etc., the lack of dynamics may not be apparent. For those listening on good hifi systems, you may find you experience some listening fatigue when trying to listen to this album all the way through even with the audiophile mastering.<br /><br />Thanks Trent for this amazing new collection of songs, you're still the man.nica unit out there.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Like a million others, I had to write a lame joke about Wool.  It's a strange title for a plot and setting that is far from it.  Neither here no there.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book.  I put it down for a while, then saw something that reminded me that I haven't finished it, and went through about 50% (Thanks Kindle, for the accuracy) within a week.  It's a good story, a take on a post-apocalyptic, back-to-basics sort of theme.  With the occasional casting off of those that are severely criminal.  Like that idea.<br /><br />It has memorable characters, at least those I remember.  You can rally on many of the focal characters, but they don't always make it to the end of the book.  There's plenty of detail on the ecosystem everyone lives within which made for a more interesting tale.  The inter-dependencies of the people became much more important that simple symbiotic living.  I think that part will stick with me most.<br /><br />I'm surprised that the book has 6,000+ reviews and is five stars.  That's unusual in anything in life.  I wouldn't go the five-star route as I don't have that feeling after reading it that \\"I'd like to go back there again\\" with a sequel.<br /><br />I'd tell you more, but I wooldn't want to ruin a good story.<br /><br />I'll be here through Thursday.  Try the fish!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This is not the review of an obsessed with Benedict Cumberbatch fan. With that being said; Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in this series, as well as Martin Freeman. In this day and age television is inundated with a copious amount of shows to choose from. Even so, we are forced to choose between a great show with mediocre acting or excellent acting with mediocre writing. Every now and then we get the perfect storm, and Sherlock is that perfect storm. The caliber of acting on this show is excellent. The chemistry between the actors is astonishing and poignant. The writing is fantastic! Mark Gatiss' and Steven Moffit's writing is nothing short of impressive. They are always tying scenes, quotes, conditions, etc. from the original stories into a contemporary Sherlock/London. You never feel like your watching a stuffy old Holmes and Watson. Your not stuck in a previous time period with formal unrecognizable speech. It is contemporary in every sense of the word; cars, iphones, modern medicine, subway system, etc. As for the idiosyncrasies well known to Holmes and Watson instead of doing away with them, or sticking to the same boring composition, Gatiss and Moffit have modernized them as well.  For example, Holmes originally smoked a pipe, in modern London he uses nicotine patches. The excellent cinematography, music, props, and on and on I could go. My recommendation: watch it!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I've always enjoyed &#34;the guys&#34; and their quests to conquer the evil beings that live amongst us.  I also enjoy the backstories about their families, even though some don't.

Dean is allowed to lighten up, and be a part of the joke for a change.<br /><br />But to the Producers of the show - never, EVER change the car or the music!

0061726834|5.0|I have been dying to read Delirium. I loved Lauren Oliver's Before I Fall, I love dystopian settings, I love the concept, and the first sentence is completely gripping. So finally, I made the time to read the book because I just knew I would love it. And I did. And I'm really glad I knew I would love it and I went ahead and purchased the entire trilogy, because I need to know what happens next!<br /><br /> Lena was a fascinating character. My absolute favorite characters in dystopian fiction are ones who don't realize their world is dystopian at all. I love being a part of that dreadful realization and watching characters start to question everything around them. I felt like I could really understand her by watching her world slowly turn upside down.<br /><br /> The society in Delirium was absolutely fascinating to me. I loved the quotes used at the beginning of each chapter from different texts that the characters in the book were familiar with. I was able to understand the history of the society and the way people felt about others through the texts and Lena's own point of view. I thought the concept of love as a disease was pretty unique. At first, the idea seemed absurd, but the more the texts were quoted, the more I realized that, while I do understand and root for love, it does have its own side effects and symptoms that can seem quite crazy. I love how the author was able to take such an absurd idea and make it believable.<br /><br /> The pacing was great. I'm sure some people will find the novel to be somewhat slow, but I thought it was perfect. I liked getting to know Lena and understanding what her life was like and what her hopes and dreams were before everything started to change. It made the metamorphosis that much more powerful and shocking. I knew a lot about the plot before reading it. I supposed that Lena would eventually fall in love and that would be the major catalyst. But once that began to happen, I was pleasantly surprised at how slow it all was. I was expecting insta-love and then instant decision making and instant risk. But Lena showed character and bravery by not blindly following one person, regardless of her feelings, and it made the book less predictable overall.<br /><br /> I loved Alex immediately, before I even knew his name. It is so great when I can be introduced to a character and know that I'll like him right away. I was intrigued and I wanted to know his story. I wanted to know more of Lena's and I wanted them to share their stories. I loved watching their entire relationship unfold in front of me. I also have a soft spot for Lena's best friend, Hana and her cousin, Grace. In their own unique ways, they were there for Lena.<br /><br /> I highly recommend Delirium and I am mentally smacking myself for waiting so long to finally read it. I really liked it and I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. The book was so thought provoking, intoxicating, and full of so many feels!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|this is a great piece to build and looks great once complete! even if you are not a huge back to the future fan, this is just a really fun lego build and great car!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I must agree with John Williamson, I installed it on my Kindle Fire HD, I believe it was one of the first apps I installed.<br /> I like how I can keep up with my battery usage from game play to music to web browser use. I can't imagine not using it now.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I would recommend this book to more than just horror fans. It reads like the most exciting and moving historical account.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Cleverly conceived concepts and puzzles to solve; that will keep anyone entertained for a good while!! Almost every puzzle is a challenge that makes one think without being too challenging as too frustrate you into wanting to give up and quit. I don't like games that you feel like you have to be a genius to play them.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; you will have puzzles in this game that you'll need to try and figure out several times to solve. Or to accomplish in a timely manor. But it will be so satisifing when you do!<br /><br />But for the most part the puzzles are unique and therefore require a different approach to problem solving to accomplish your goals. Good luck and have fun!
B000I186FW|1.0|Disappointed in the obvious slanted left message...Nothing like trying to watch entertainment and indirectly having propaganda thrown in your face.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the story line...giving multiple characters and their thoughts and actions...really love  Jo didn't see that coming. Loved the ending. Would recommend this book
B00F91H666|1.0|9/17/13: Paid twice to rent the movie but it doesn't show up in my library. I got an email saying its been paid for, the email says its in my library, but nothing there. Everytime I try to watch it,i'm prompted to pay another $3.99, so I gave up. Tried contacting Amazon right away via their \\"Help\\" link, but it doesn't list help for instant videos.<br />9/18/13: This morning I was able to send an email directly to Amazon regarding this issue. It has been resolved after careful consideration of the circumstance and a refund will be issued in 2-3 days.<br /><br />Since I was unable to watch World War Z, I tried renting another movie \\"Phantom\\", as a test. Its a good movie and I didn't have any trouble watching it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Really a nice addition. The alarm sounds and ability to add my own is a nice feature. I can see the time, weather and temp first thing. I look forward to using the app on a daily basis.
B003WGM40S|1.0|The picture is lovely and the beginning is fine. Unfortunately the story never takes a turn for the better but for the worse. This is a very depressing show and I would not recommended to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is my game I love it so much. and more power to the people who made this game. if you are wondering if you should purchase this app you should and you'll love the cute minions
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is extremely AWESOME and fun it is worth buying even though it is seven dollars.I have been waiting a really long time for the roller coaster  update to come out.
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|Great cast, very funny baseball movie. Many stars appearing early in their careers, Wesley Snipes, Charlie Sheen and Rene Russo.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|If you liked the first movie, this one will be a treat.  Khan's character was well-executed as a villain and the chemistry between Spok and Captain Kirk was as good as ever.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This movie makes me want to give up movies forever. I was so incredibly let down by the crappy ending I've lost my faith in Liam Neeson. I even paid attention the whole way through - treally expecting it to go somwhere.<br />it doesnt.<br />save your money.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|As usual Michael Connelly keeps you interested and in suspense to the very last page. All of Harry Bosh's  cases keep me enthralled.
B00F6NKFQK|5.0|Sometimes you need to take a break and read something silly. This fits the bill. Instead of trying to explain, I decided to tease you with my favorite quotes and then simply say, you'll have to get your own copy to understand.<br /><br />Here they are in no particular order:<br /><br />--\\"A lot of my loyal blog readers, Twitter followers and even members of the Royal household (who should really know better; I'm looking at you, wife number 17) ask me, 'Why do you want to conquer Paris?'\\"<br /><br />--\\"Zeus. HA! I think I dated that guy.\\"<br /><br />--\\"Like people were alive in the twenties.\\"<br /><br />--\\"How often do you dream of Jeopardy AND Alex Trebek?\\"
B004SIP9B0|5.0|Great movie!! The cast did an awesome job portraying the royal family. Interesting take on the aftermath of Princess Diana's death.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I stepped WAY out of my normal genre on this one, but I'm so glad that I did, because now I want to see the movie.<br />Spies, action, Nazis, and an assassination plot come together in this well-written, fast-paced story.<br />Pick this one up today.
1936608898|4.0|good basic info written in easy to understand language that helps connect the dots on why good nutrition is so important.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great. Was hard to put down.  Grisham was getting predictable but this one kept you guessing. Glad he is back to his old ways.  Thoroughly enjoyed this.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I tried a few other competitors to swift key and got frustrated with having to type in the same phrases,  many of which I use all the time.  Swift key seems to have the ability to learn how I prefer to use the keyboard on my phone.  It is definitely a keeper!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I couldn't wait until Netflix made them available for streaming, so I rented the 1st episode. Great show! Now season 3 is available on Comcast On Demand. Netflix streaming release date is 9.29.13.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much. I have very good update ideas. Mob spawn eggs. Real crafting Redstone logic and real nether and nether portals. Thank you
B00000F214|4.0|The Usual Suspects is a fairly dark penetration into our perceptions of reality.  It tends to question the things that we're aware of versus that which is beneath the water line. I've watched it twice, and I have some trouble following it, but I think it is worth my time. I'm gonna watch it again and again, because the nuances are difficult to pick up.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I loved this movie and the movie's soundtrack! I would totally recommend this movie. I watched it twice because I loved it so much and I never watch a movie twice.
B00723NWJE|4.0|Norah Jones has now established herself as an eminent icon in &#34;Little Broken Hearts.&#34;  It's not bubble-gum; it's mellow and a bit dark. It's my kind of music!

2090338482|3.0|chapter 1 starts right in on verbs, assuming the student knows things like the alphabet & pronunciation already.  it is not a beginner book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun, mindless entertainment. enjoyable! makes you want ti keep getting the puzzle pieces. fun when bored. good time passer! I like it.
B001I45UFC|4.0|I really think you should read this book because you don't know what will happen next it feels like it's 2 books in one
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard for Android, hands down!  The predictive input is excellent and the swipe input is awesome.
B00E687MWQ|5.0|In the world of metal a self-titled album can mean a few things, either a band is running out of ideas or they have recorded a record which captures the spirit of their music. While many \\"black metal elitists\\" out their will say the former is true for this record I have to strongly disagree as Satyricon is probably their strongest release since 2002's Volcano, even though I loved both Now, Diabolical and The Age of Nero! Anyway onto the review, Satyricon is an album that greets us with its thunderous analog production which is something we have not had in a long time, which is a good thing because analog production brings out the guitar tones and the drums a lot better than the modern day digital production we have become accustom to.<br /><br />When the thunder of the opening instrumental Voice of Shadows marched its way through my ears it became apparent to me that this album was going to be much more mellow and laid back than any of the bands previous releases, which isn't a bad thing. The mellow and laid back approach Satyr and Frost took with this record allows for some of the most emotional moments you will ever hear from them. From the melodic Tro og Kraft, the doomy cries of Nocturnal Flare, to the sweeping grace that is The Infinity of Time and Space the album just hits you with emotion and atmosphere!  However, there is a song on this record that will take all black metal fans by surprise on their first listen of Satyricon, and that song is Phoenix sung by Sivert Høyem of the Norwegian rock band Madrugada. Sivert's clean vocals will be taken as blasphemy by many black metal elitists, while I myself see it as a great change of pace, it calms the mind after hearing the anthem Nocturnal Flare, and when your guard is down you shall be smacked in the face by the aggressive might of Walker Upon the Wind.<br /><br />Overall, Satyricon is a solid release and one which should be approached with a open mind, do not come here expecting Nemesis Divina part 2 or a continuation of The Age of Nero, if you do you will be sorely disappointed!  However, those that do listen to this album with an open mind will be in for a treat!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|From my 11 year old son, \\"This is the best book I've ever read - ever. I don't want<br />it to end, its really a good book.\\"
B000W93CHC|4.0|It is excellent but it is VERY long. It was very interesting and you got a good feeling for the conflict among the church leaders and the difference with the &#34;common folk&#34; and the difficulty of enlisting the aid of the wealthy in a project as vital as a bridge. Is that any different to today's problems???
B00A0MJ9VY|5.0|my kids love this movie. peter pan has always been a favorite. this movie will go on in traditions forever.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|This is a very funny movie! First saw it on Netflix.  It was so funny that I wanted to purchase it to add to our movie library.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|THe story is too disfunctional for me. It rang home at how messed up kids are when they have tough childhoods.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I consider this one of the best QOTSA albums. It has a dark, vintage rock feel to it at times, while a grunginess with a modern twist to it at others. It's worth the investment.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I just got my Chromecast and I am not happy at all.  I was told that we could stream local video but that does not seem to be an option.  There are only 3 apps you can use. YouTube, Netflix and GooglePlay.  What a disappointment.  Don't buy this unless you only want to push that content.  I am sending my 2 units back and buying Apple TV
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game tons of rooms with things to do outside of them I'm not sure if there was an update but I removed and re-downloaded and is a much better game thus far play it
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|This albumm is full of little surprises. These guys really put time and effort in making this album different from what people are used to. These songs are awesome live btw.
B009AY04A8|3.0|This is a great game a little to much talking but a very interesting game. Easy to play and keep up with looking forward to part two
B007N31YH0|5.0|This one is timeless.  It's a great movie for all ages, any generation, or to just sit down and be amazed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent. Keeps you sharp!  You will get lost in this world if you are not careful. Graphics are amazing. Highly recommend
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Easy read that packs a punch. Lots of good practical tips and tricks. Well worth reading, I'll be going back to it
B00ESY77LO|4.0|I had heard that this was a remake of a classic movie and began watching the movie without much expectations.  The movie was EXCELLENT!!  The only reason i'm giving it 4 stars out of 5 was because i didn't like the ending...not from a filming standpoint but just how the story unfolded.  It was different to see a period piece with modern music, but that also was some of the appeal.  Definitely one of the best surprise movies i've seen in a while.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I ordered the series for my grandson. It makes you jump every time! He has seen it again and again.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This was a really short demo. I only got about 5 minutes play. I dont even feel like I got a demo at all.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|No sound on TV When i play local video within Google chrome browser<br /><br />- Sound works fine on TV when streaming movies from Google chrome.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!
0307476073|5.0|Excellent.  Cheryl Strayed did an amazing job making an 1100 mile journey exciting!!!  She deserves a tremendous amount of credit for all she has been through.  Sharp lady and author.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|It's been 17 years since the last studio album from Carcass. When I heard they were releasing a new one I was highly surprised. Necroticism is my favorite album by them and Heartwork is a masterpiece. I had the pleasure of meeting the band and seeing them when they toured for those classic albums. Swansong left a bitter taste in my mouth, so much that I never bought the album or gave it a proper listen . Fast forward to 2013 and Carcass are back with a vengeance. This has to be one of the most successful comeback albums by any metal band. Obituary and Suffocation made solid returns to the fold , albeit in lackluster fashion. Surgical Steel is an album that perfectly meshes nostaligia with modern progression. Press play and this album will transport you right back to 1994. While Jeff Walker and Bill Steer are the only founding members, they managed to resurrect the classic Carcass sound. Interestingly enough, this album plays out in the succession of their last 3 albums. It begins with the cold, clinical and macabre brutality of Necroticism then morphs into the polished, hooky melodies of Heartwork and then closes with the Thin Lizzy and Megadeth -like hard rock melodies of Swan Song. Jeff Walkers' voice is in top form here with added depth and more demension than previously heard. The new drummer is an apt replacement for Ken Owen. If anything, my only criticism would be the lyrics ; they seem to be much more tongue and cheek than before. It is astounding that a band gone for nearly two decades could return with such force and precision ; it's as if they never missed a beat. Colin Richardson's production is powerful and pristine as always. This may not be as exciting as Necroticism or as memorable as Heartwork but Surgical Steel is a vicious return to form . While it may be a little late in the game for Carcass to step up to the plate, I'm glad they have because this is a cracking grand slam for the metal world . How your poor heart will bleed .
B009GEFXLC|5.0|If you're a Castle fan, this DVD set will add to your collection.  Delivered as promised; PRIME membership is great and we've used it for the past few years.  Items always delivered as promised in condition as promised.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I love Star Trek it reminds me of my youth with my family watching it on the one family tv
B00ECUARO8|4.0|No high tech sci-fi here.  Not so much a happy ride into the sunset either.  But truly a story you get absorbed into.  The writers brought emotion and basic human nature into this story.  Who do you trust, who do you show loyalty to?  How do you make those choices?  This movie shows you the depth of human character.  I had to reflect on this movie a while to realize... I really enjoyed it.
B00EYAMEX8|4.0|I bought this for my soon to be 11 year old daughter. I listened to a few of the songs and they are very suitable for her age. I would recommend this to any parent who is cautious and concerned about what their child listens to.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Incredible graphics, fun and challenging puzzles. An excellent game in the best Myst tradition. I can't wait for part 2.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love the app! Its fun and easy Nybody can play this. Some words are hard but easy to figure out. (:
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Loved this movie so much I am totally hooked on them now. See this one first though Enjoy it again and again
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It is easy to play and it can very easily become addicting.  The graphics are pleasing as well as having a good story line.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This story didn't end the way I would have thought it would have, that said it was a good read and glad I read it.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Having read Khaled Hosseini's previous two books The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Sins I was excited to see another book from him. I did enjoy the story but found some parts a bit drawn out, to the point I wondered why they where at all. Never the less it is a good story.
B000IMUYJM|1.0|I SEARCHED THE WEB FOR THE ALL TIME SCARIEST MOVIE. THIS WAS AT THE TOP. WHAT A JOKE!<br />IN FACT IT WASNOT AS I EXPECTED. THE EVIL DEAD WAS BETTER THAN THIS.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I got the update it sucks if search a YouTubers name it pops up random videos the old one was better
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I bought this album just before a roadtrip in the US and it was definitely the soundtrack of that adventure. This was Coldplay's best album in my opinion.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wow, this was so much better than the movie, as books always are. Charlie is special. He makes you really appreciate life as it is no matter the heartache or the love you feel. This story will stay with me always.
015206057X|5.0|Whenever Mem Fox and Helen Oxenbury get together, you know it's going to be good. This is a sweet book for young children, which exposes them to a multicultural perspective without being over the top.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play this game it's a great distraction from boredom in waiting rooms. Good game to play when u have a little time on your hands.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Another sweet movie by Miyazaki and the Ghibli crew. This is the story of a boy and girl who work together to save an historic building. Suitable for all ages.

B008SAZHLQ|4.0|very well-written.  a unique approach to coming of age/young love that is poignant and pretty credible.  i enjoyed the book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|..5 star  Gone girl as told was suspenseful and quirky.LoLita of twists and turns loved the first person chapters. Great
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is awesome I love it, it's like Dragon vale. I kinda think it's better than minecraft  and I love that game. What you get to do is have a floating island, make habitats and breed dragons. The point is GET THIS GAME.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game!Anyone that loves My Little Pony will love this game. I rate it 5 stars! The only part you will not like is that Rainbow Dash and Rarity cost gems. But I promise you will love the rest of the game. Enjoy the app!
1587143879|5.0|Great books offering, great deal, excellent package, super-fast delivery. Just satisfied with the purchase, contains all the described features, the CD's and the books are in nice readable prints.
B003UYUP58|3.0|This is the history of how the medical establishment approached the treatment of cancer rather than the story of how we achieved our current level of understanding about this disease. As a teacher and medical researcher I found this account quite interesting as it covers many of the misconceptions of the past. There is very little in this book that will inform the reader about the exciting new scientific concepts currently under consideration. Descriptions of chemotherapeutic regimens are presented in great detail along with the politics of the medical community. Its value lies in its description of the clinicians who fought cancer rather than in a discussion of the disease itself. I would not recommend this book to a person currently battling cancer.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|I didn't have a clue what this was about before viewing it, and enjoyed it. The production was very well done. The only negative I have was the outcome of Tess' struggles. If you're looking for a happily-ever-after, this one isn't for you. The ending was just, but left me bummed-out. I won't spoil it. The production was very well done, and the period piece seemed accurate.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book cannot be put into words but I'll say this: You must read! Anyone over the age of ten would enjoy this book. I could not put it down!
B009AY04A8|5.0|I got this game and was surprised how fun it was.  It kept my attention through the whole game.  I really like the option to skip the dialog.  I recommend it.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|I bought this dvd as a gift for my husband, who is a huge fan of the series.  The quality of both the dvd and the packaging were high, and he was thrilled with his gift.

B00275EGWY|4.0|I have seen Hurt Locker several times and still enjoy it. Being a retired Army Vet, I know the film is a fictional story no more accurate than Rambo!!! When I see this film, I treat it the same way I treat the Fast and Furious series or anything with Tom Cruise - as a fantasy on film with the purpose of entertainment!!! To those who never served, this film is nothing but fantasy. To those who have served, this is just a fantasy film. Either way, it was well made, well acted, and a good all around movie. If you don't criticize Fast and Furious for not realistically portraying illegal street racing, why would you criticize this film for being equally unrealistic?
B00CL151G4|5.0|I am a Holmes fan and I was skeptical of Sherlock in New York and Watson a woman.  I decided to give it a chance and now appreciate the writing, the acting, the setting, the twists and turns of plots.  It you enjoy real brains behind a project and relate to creativity this is satisfying and rewards you for your time watching.
0375869026|5.0|This is a must read for all kids so they appreciate life and have a insight in someone else's shoes.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I like all the different ways this story could go! I like the blending of all the players and what will their next turn be? I love the love story with all the drama that comes with being in love! Can't wait for the next book!
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|The first in this fantasy series by Scott Lynch takes a little while before the story really takes off, but the second half of this book is superb.  Great action, well-told, and a terrific finish that leaves you eager to read the second book (which I have not read).  The main character of Locke Lamora is interesting, worth rooting for, and cleverly created.  Lynch clearly has talent, and I'd recommend reading this book.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|I watched this movie with 2 sons and daughter-in-law yesterday. Gruesome and absolutely hysterical at the same time! This is now one of my favorite movies! I ordered the dvd so I can watch it with my husband, then lend it to others.
B00APACSJG|4.0|Maybe it's been awhile, but this book seemed . . . for lack of a better word - &#34;old&#34;.  I missed the old flair of Miles - although he was there, and still was able to get into, and out of, one crisis after another.  It's just that it seemed to be missing something.  It was &#34;good&#34; . . . just not as exciting as the other Miles books.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book really kept me interested from start to finish.  I liked the characters portrayed and the way the story was told from different viewpoints that you knew would, sooner or later,  converge.  Very interesting characters!  I cannot wait to read more by this author!
0920668372|5.0|I may have been particularly emotional or attached to my parents when I was younger but I remember when they bought this book, it was for my younger sister.  I stayed in the room when they read it the first time and fell to pieces by 2/3's in.  I'll never forget the line \\"I'll love you for ever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living my baby you'll be.\\"  I remember telling them that I would never grow up and leave and I would always stay their baby.  I'm 25 now and my parents still quote that to me which still gets me.  Love the book, it's beautiful and I will definitely read it to my children whenever they come. Hopefully I'll be able to get through it when I read it to them!
B00CSYRHG6|3.0|This movie was nothing liked the other studio ghibli offerings that we've enjoyed. It has a more serious and an even somewhat dark tone, and lacks the innocence of the other films. As it begins, a boy and girl start to fall in love with each other, and then by happenstance find out they may be brother and sister. The movie then takes you through the process of finding out the truth. I wish we could have enjoyed it more, but everyone seemed to share the same opinion after it was over, which was \\"it was just ok\\". I also couldn't imagine ever watching it again, unlike the other ghibli movies which we have watched many times. I would suggest that you do watch the movie and form your own opinion, however I wouldn't suggest buying it right away like I did. Maybe rent it the first time until you decide if you like it. We will still anxiously await the next studio ghibli project though!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I loved this book! Just reading through the life of the world's greatest inventors was inspiring in and of itself. It's a pretty quick read, but is still deep enough that you really get to see what made him tick.<br />There were a few typos, like some of the other reviews said, but mostly you could get past them. Although when he called him Telsa instead of Tesla several times on the same page, I almost wrote the author a letter.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|....three things I love in an app. I got this app when it was Free App of the Day and was instantly entranced. I had no bugs or issues on my device. The games got really hard and my pages were pretty messy towards the end. I would recommend this app to anyone who is looking for a game that requires thinking, quick reflexes, and strategy. Unfortunately, I cannot give this 5 stars. I finished this game in less than a day and was like :-(  when it was over... just like that. I hope for more updates and puzzles to make me curse and want to bash my Kindle Fire HD against my head.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Special effects were top notch but the story blows. Spock is an emotional cripple, Kirk is a wussy, Uhura is a nagging girl friend, Sulu is still nothing, Chekov is a dope and Scotty is relegated to little more than comic relief. The only real positive was Bones because Urban is the only one to actually try to emulate his predecessor.  Skip this one unless you are a brain dead Abrams fan. Real Star Trek fans see this crap for what it is.  PURE CRAP!

B00E6890RG|5.0|I loved Visions and one thing I can say about this band is that they are consistent. Where as a lot of prog bands are playing the same stuff they are progressing. High points for me Atlas Stone, In Memoriam, Because it's there, Pareidolia.

B000087F6M|5.0|I know the courtroom is supposed to be this hallowed venue where justice is meted out with dignity and decorum. But, man, do I love it when the circus comes to town. I watch the courtroom drama for the theatricality of it. I love it when this or that lawyer resorts to putting on a show and is threatened by the judge with being held in contempt. I love it when the incensed judge commands both counsels to approach the bench and then chews them out.<br /><br />To quote Assistant D. A. Tom Logan: \\"A person is entitled to his or her own opinion. Lawyers have to prove theirs in court.\\" He said that in LEGAL EAGLES, a 1986 Ivan Reitman production. It's a film that tries to be all things to everyone. It's a courtroom drama, a whodunit, a romantic comedy, and an action thriller. That it works as a highly enjoyable picture is thanks largely to the inarguable chemistry between Robert Redford and Debra Winger. They play courtroom adversaries who end up putting their heads together to resolve a particularly explosive case.<br /><br />Tom Logan (Redford), polished and elegant, is being groomed as the next D.A. Laura J. Kelly (Winger) is a defense attorney who once tried to put a dog on the witness stand. They've only ever known each other peripherally in the court houses of Seattle. But this and that happens and Logan and Kelly find themselves in a lively partnership, probing a cover-up of an 18-year-old murder investigation.<br /><br />Ivan Reitman - who writes, produces, and directs the film - hedges his bets by introducing summer blockbuster beats, and I'm of course talking about all the scenes where things explode or get set on fire and cars crash and our heroes dodge bullets and plunge into the drink off a forklift. But you strip away all that and what's left is the film's saving grace. LEGAL EAGLES is never more captivating than when Redford and Winger are sharing the screen and engaged in banter. They're so watchable together, and Winger is so damn endearing here, and Redford is absolutely correct when he remarks on Winger's marvelous eyes. She uses them to wonderful effect. Maybe it's sacrilegious to compare Redford and Winger to Tracy and Hepburn in how they propel the age-old battle-of-the-sexes theme, but I'm comparing anyway.<br /><br />The screenplay invests our squabbling attorneys with affectionate character touches. Tom Logan tap dances in the bathroom whenever he gets insomnia. Laura Kelly is a backseat driver who doesn't know how to drive, and I know that that's not really an affectionate trait but damn if Winger isn't so likable that she turns that into winsome behavior. It's massive fun watching Logan's precision and elegance run into Kelly's imagination and unconventional methods.<br /><br />At this stage in her career, Daryl Hannah was still considered hot property, based on the cachet earned from earlier hits like BLADE RUNNER and SPLASH. She's again a hypnotic presence, here playing Chelsea Deardon, the troubled, enigmatic 26-year-old performance artist who becomes Kelly's client.<br /><br />It hearkens back to the screwballs of the 1930s and '40s. It's a sweet love story. It presents one of the most memorable (and combustible) opening statements an attorney will ever make in a courtroom. One of the film's flaws is that we never get enough of Logan and Kelly in court. I could've done with more personal moments between the two and maybe less of the explody stuff. I could've done with more of gazing into Debra Winger's eyes or her being a klutz or her just standing there being wonderful. Robert Redford's alright, too.ord is absolutely correct when he remarks on Winger's marvelous eyes. She uses them to wonderful effect.

I mean come on, 1st few minutes it was confusing, then them characters like Rain and Todd were in multiples, one bad one good, Red Army zombies (for real?,some people came back from dead, don't know bout rest of viewers but I did scratch my head more than once while watching.....time to wrap it up!

B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game made me laugh a few times the first time I ran it. It has great visuals and smooth animations. I couldn't get the hang of the tilt controls but the touch controls seemed to work for me most of the time. Sounds are good enough to keep you immersed but not amazing. I like the dynamic soundtrack which changes based on gameplay.  I love games that reward you for playing and &quot;progressing&quot; and this game does it well. You can pay to progress your shark or be patient and just play. Eating fish will keep you alive as well as increase your level and give you points. Fun game.

B000IAXVGW|5.0|It's a classic TV story, a classic scenario - submarine warfare - but done well. An excellent guest star (Marc Lenard as the Romulan Commander), and containing some \\"Star Trek\\" additions: the wedding (and subsequent funeral), and the bigotry issue (and subsequent resolution).<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this episode to anyone who wants to know what Star Trek was all about in terms of TV history.<br /><br />I would _not_ recommend it to anyone interested in a fast-paced TV show with lots of action. That's not in there!
0143124544|4.0|I read Jo Jo Moyes' \\"The Girl You Left Behind\\" right before reading this one.  I'd seen a blurb about that which interested me, and when I went to buy that book, read some of the reviews on this one and felt it might also be interesting, as well as challenging subject matter.  I much preferred \\"Me Before You.\\"  The characters are believable -- flawed and quirky.  The story is thoughtfully told and well developed, and concluded realistically.  I won't say more on that for fear of ruining it for others.  There are some narration changes slipped in that were at first off-putting, as you weren't expecting the sudden shift to a different narrator, but they did advance the story in ways that wouldn't have been possible with Lou as the narrator.  So, I forgive the author the awkwardness.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Take it for what it is - a book about dominant/submissive relationship & sex.  If you are expecting a literary masterpiece, you might be dissapointed.  I enoyed the book & look forward to reading the next two books.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|I struggled over the rating here. Five stars for the music - no question. The packaging, however, gets three or four stars. The concept and quality of this Rhino box and its LP-styled CD covers is definitely better than all those 'Original Album Classics' boxes put out by Sony, Warner, and others (mainly in the EU). But, it's not as good as Legacy's series of 'Complete Albums' boxes (such as the fabulous [[ASIN:B00CJCHJ8S Nilsson]] box), which use heavier stock for the album covers and include detailed liner notes and track annotation in a separate book.<br /><br />However, if you don't own the early, classic Joni Mitchell albums - which I didn't, having only ever sprung for [[ASIN:B000002N9Z Hits]] and [[ASIN:B000002NAX Misses]] - it's an excellent, affordable way to get up-to-speed. And, that's worth five stars!
B00F57VFXO|5.0|This was my first exposure to Bond creator, Commander Ian Fleming of the Naval Intelligence Department.  It becomes obvious that much of 007's adventures were based on Fleming's exploits. Stevenson's tireless research on the subject is evident in the books tiniest of details.<br /><br />Set in WWII Britain, Agent 17F is sent on an assignment that would save Hitler from an assassination!  Save Hitler?  Why in the hell would the Brits want to save Hitler?  Because those plotting to take his place plan to make peace with Russia and a new and even more powerful Forth Reich would emerge.  The complete and utter invasion of Europe should these two mega-forces unite would be inevitable.  At least with Hitler in charge the Brits have a chance to win the war.<br /><br />Stevenson has a very definitive and concise writing style.  He does not add fluff where it does not belong.  This is WWII Europe after all.  While reading the book you almost get the sense that he was there.  His ability to transport you back to 1945 with his descriptive imagery is second to none.  I admit to not being a big follower of Bond or WWII movies but I could not put this one down.  It's an edgy, fast-paced, action-packed thriller that is a must read for any Bond fan.  This would make an awesome movie!

B00EL8JCGU|1.0|I made the mistake of reading the book first, then seeing the movie. The book is a panoramic view of the world coming to grips with a worldwide plague, told from numerous viewpoints with depth and drama. Compared to that, the movie was a mess. Rather like the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, all the producers did was buy the title of a good book and stick it on a bad movie. If you must spend money on it, wait until it comes to Redbox and only lose a buck.

B0025VLELQ|2.0|I bought this film on Blu-Ray without having previously seen it, on the weight of the stellar reviews it has on Amazon and elsewhere. The Blu-Ray transfer is very good, slightly grainy, but that is typical of films this age. The movie itself is pretty dated and feels very low budget.<br /><br />Filmed and set in the eighties, The Last Starfighter tells the story of an average teenage boy who does so well at a video game he is recruited into a previously unknown space armada. If the plot sounds cheesy to you, that's because it's cheesy. If some eighties cheese doesn't bother you, the acting probably won't throw you off, and you'll get a kick out of some of the film's genuinely funny moments.<br /><br />This was one of the first films to make extensive use of CG, and it shows in the atrocious quality of the numerous fully rendered space sequences. CG objects are low-poly and usually untextured. The space battles are very poorly choreographed, and don't match well with the live-action footage they are interspliced with. In short, the space battles are painful to watch, and they make up a significant portion of the film.<br /><br />Catherine Mary Stewart was a highlight of the movie for me. She looks gorgeous. Your mileage may vary, but if you think she's cute and don't mind eighties haircuts, it might be worth the price of the BD just to see her in high-definition.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Wow - I love this three match game! Playix makes the best puzzle games and I look forward to downloading more of them. The play is fun and sometimes frustrating with the boulders &amp; walls but never discouraging so that I will stop playing.
B00DVT54RQ|5.0|Faith No More is probably best known for their breakthrough album &#34;The Real Thing&#34;, but the band continued to evolve and push the boundaries of music with each new release. &#34;Album of the Year&#34; was no exception. With Mike Patton's insane vocal delivery he's all over the place on this record... and that's a good thing. From his lounge style singing to all out screaming psychotic bursts of energy and everything in between, your ears will be delighted and bleeding! The band is super tight and mixes it up nicely for one incredibly diverse album. There's not one throwaway track on this album, each one is a masterpiece unto itself. So stop reading this stupid review and drop this in your cart.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like it because I do and didn't cost anything but annoyed I have to do this now. Maybe charge something and not make us rate. Had no internet access so couldn't play until I did and could rate.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app has a fairly user-friendly interface, and has many options for viewing conditions and forecasts.  I'd like to see an option for accessibility, to increase font size, but it is usable without that option.  I'd recommend this app to others.
B002RVCD6O|1.0|After the movie begins, there is a 24 hour window in which it must be completely watched.  This is the second time we did not make the window and missed the last 1/2 hour of the movie.  My family has busy schedules and 48 or 72 hours seems more fair.

B006ICOK00|5.0|My boss bought this camera for a time lapse project that he placed me in charge of during this summer, capturing video of the construction being done on our university. We also bought a TimelapseCam 8.0 from Wingscapes.<br />Avoid that camera.<br />Anyway, the Brinno just amazed me! The battery life is phenomenal! On 2 AA batteries, it runs for 4 or 5 days. This is what I experiences having it take a photo every 10 seconds.<br />I also love the way that it puts the stills together for you. I do video editing with Premiere, and was planning on taking still frames and making them into a timelapse video on my own, but I couldn't be happier with the quality of the video that the camera makes itself!<br />You can choose the frames per second that you want your video to be made into. It is .AVI format.<br />You can also just have it export stills and put them together by yourself, but I see no need to do it.<br />With the shaking of our building, the camera fell down from the suction cup mount that we had it on several times. It is durable! It still works great.<br />It is small and light and aesthetically pleasing.<br />I really couldn't be happier with this camera. Great product!<br />We also used the wide-angle attachment. This gave us a bit of a wider view. It connects to the lens via a magnet and a metal ring around the lens on the camera. Sturdy and good quality.
B00C0K6NUY|5.0|Graham Masterton's Broken Angels is a superb detective thriller and gruesome to the point of being horror. Detective Inspector Katie Maguire is under pressure from all sides. First, she is a woman in a man's world doing a man's job. Second, she does this job better than anyone else. Third, she must solve a brutal murder case with very few clues and last, Katie has a train wreck of a personal life to deal with.<br />Two fishermen discover the body of Father Heaney in the Blackwater River. Once Katie arrives it is soon discovered the priest was tortured in a particular way that suggests revenge for child molestation. This immediately sends up red flags through the church and a cover is implemented. Katie does not fall into the trap of the obvious and leaves the revenge theory as just that - a theory. She will not come to a decision until all her ducks are in a row.<br />But when another priest turns up with even more horrific injuries, Katie must decide if a serial killer is on the loose in County Cork, Southern Ireland. Add to her mounting problems the Catholic Church with too many secrets and ways to conceal them and a lack of solid clues then poor Katie's task seems insurmountable.<br />Graham Masterton expertly juggles Irish humour written in the local tongue, deep knowledge of the Catholic faith, and Katie's personal struggles with her boyfriend, father and wayward sister. His descriptions of the torture scenes are graphic in the extreme, and yet, also there is a lyrical quality throughout which deftly underpins the sadistic killer's traits, creating a masterpiece of detective writing.<br />I would recommend this FIVE STAR novel to anyone who enjoys a great thriller, intricacies of detective procedures and a book that lovingly describes Ireland, its people's idiosyncrasies - of which there are many, countryside and quaint villages.

B00DMEQP46|3.0|I went into this release blind, having heard none of the songs and knowing virtually nothing about what how it would sound. MGMT is a duo that is full of surprises, to say the least, and this release is no exception. It's chaotic, loud, psychedelic, and free-flowing. Those looking for another repeat of their debut will once again be disappointed, as this picks up right where their excellent sophomore album left off. For listeners looking for something challenging and different, then this is a trippy and wonderful world to visit, if only out of curiosity.<br /><br />\\"Alien Days\\" is a fitting opener, with vocals and atmospheric twists that help to make it sound as if it's being transmitted from another planet. Like most of the tracks presented on this record, it's ripe for interpretation and multiple listens to uncover everything it has to offer. \\"Mystery Disease\\" would have fit in well on Congratulations, its distorted drums and chiming synth work coalesce into something quite experimental and funky. \\"Your Life is a Lie\\" is a quick, noisy number that has potential but passes by too quickly to ever fully form. \\"A Good Sadness\\" helps the record recover with some spacey vocals and unique structure, as does \\"Astro-Mancy\\". \\"Introspection\\" is decent, a Faine Jade cover that's serviceable but nothing that couldn't have been filled by something else (though it does deserve recognition for sounding a bit more listener-friendly for those who want something more accessible). \\"I Love You Too, Death\\" once again has potential but never gets off the ground, instead choosing to float by in a wall of psychedelic swirls and beats. \\"Plenty of Girls in the Sea\\" and \\"An Orphan of Fortune\\" both close the album on a decent note, though neither track is a particular standout. Producer Dave Friedman has the duo sound more than ever like The Flaming Lips this time around, although I think the Lips can pull this off with more confidence. MGMT sounds buried under the production and the album lacks the confidence needed to elevate it to greater heights.<br /><br />One thing these tracks will make clear is the major recurring problem on the album: the hooks are few and far between. While the songs themselves are often fascinating and fun to listen to they're also somewhat forgettable, packed at times with so much production that the heart of the songs seems buried and almost non-existant. While MGMT has never been geared toward mainstream consumption they did always carry a sense of fun and structured pop that allowed their tunes to appeal to the public as well as the indie enthusiasts. Unfortunately this release is a cake with a lot of frosting but very little actual cake buried beneath. Couple that with another over-compressed and horribly mastered sound and you have a record that certainly stands out but only for a brief period. It's fun to listen to and will certainly be receiving many spins from me; this time, however, it will be more out of curiosity and less out of love for the actual songs. I like what they tried to do here but after two years of production it sounds like a lot of tinkering and promising ideas without strong tunes to back them up. This group is growing and I admire that, yet they seem unfocused and unsure of what they to do and where they want to go. After two albums that had charm, hooks, and a clear direction it seems their third album finds them at an impasse between staying in the past and moving forward. Here's hoping the next installment will take the great ideas from this record and meld them into something more tangible.cks the confidence needed to elevate it to greater heights.<br /><br />One thing these tracks will make clear is the major recurring problem on the album: the hooks are few and far between.

1619491486|5.0|This is the story of Lady Constance Chatterley, or 'Connie', her loveless marriage to Sir Clifford Chatterley, a man rendered both physically and emotionally crippled and impotent by the First World War, and her love affair with their gamekeeper, Mellors, a unique character who has deliberately retreated from opportunities for social and economic advancement and returned to his working class roots. The story is completely character-driven, which is why its grand themes of the immutability of the class divide, the dangers of championing the mind over the body and the fundamental human need for true 'connexion' with other human beings are almost never jarring.<br /><br />This book surprised me in so many ways. I expected it to be erotic, which it was not; what I didn't expect was a narrative voice that so perfectly matched the evolution of the plot - a voice both flexible and artistically true. At the beginning of the story, when describing Connie's butterfly-like peregrinations from one casual affair to the next, the voice is whimsical and childlike. From somewhere around the middle of the book onwards, the plot steadily intensifies, matched blow for blow by the narrative voice, which tightens its focus and becomes much more cynical and fatalistic.<br /><br />With the touch of the iron fist inside the velvet glove, Lawrence moves his characters to steadily expound on his themes so that you never realise you are being taken on a journey until suddenly, you find you have arrived at the destination. You can look back and realise that the repetition of concern with 'connexion', that the almost comical regularity with which Connie was said to feel genuine emotions 'in the womb' and Mellors was said to feel the same 'in the bowels', and the myriad other earthy metaphors involving parts of the body or sexual intercourse were all leading you to the realisation of what Mellors, the oracle of this tale, sums up so neatly in the end:<br /><br />'Sex is really only touch, the closest of all touch. And it's touch we're afraid of. We're only half-conscious, and half alive. We've got to come alive and aware.' (DH Lawrence, &lt;i>Lady Chatterley's Lover&lt;/i>, Empire Books, USA, 2013, p. 336)<br /><br />Through the characters of Mellors and Mrs Bolton, DH Lawrence leads you gently to the book's anti-intellectual, anti-authoritarian conclusion that there is no crossing of the class divide, but the joke is really on the upper classes, because real truth and beauty reside almost entirely with the working class. This is memorably summarised once again by Mellors-as-oracle:<br /><br />'I can't stand the twaddling bossy impudence of the people who run this world. That's why I can't get on. I hate the impudence of money, and I hate the impudence of class.' (DH Lawrence, &lt;i>Lady Chatterley's Lover&lt;/i>, Empire Books, USA, 2013, p. 334)<br /><br />A surprise package in almost every way, subtly profound and unfailingly engaging, &lt;i>Lady Chatterley's Lover&lt;/i> is enigmatic, unsettling, funny and stylistically beautiful.

B00CL68BK2|2.0|I found this movie a bit depressing and I was bored most of the time. I almost turned it off after about 20 minutes but my husband wanted to keep watching.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game. I would rate it five stars if I did not have to wait for the energy to refill.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My daughter loves her Wubbanub. I give this as a gift now to every new mom I know. I don't know if it's good or bad but my 19 month old will not sleep without this so we had to get a backup just in case so we are never without one! It's very soothing to her and she loves it!
B004XZR63M|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone trying to gain further knowledge about financial management but also just things to learn in life as we grow
B000JIHP88|5.0|As others have said, this mobile is not very loud but when you have it in a quiet nursery I do feel that the volume is appropriate and just right for helping baby fall asleep. My daughter loved this.
B005TZFZ9W|4.0|Young Money Records. One of Lil' Wayne's heavy hitters on the label going solo. Thank you for the deals Amazon.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My husband and I are both 30 and we loved this movie. It was entertaining from start to finish. I would highly recommend.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|My boyfriends birthday is coming up and he loves Johnny Depp. He's been looking nonstop for this movie so its the perfect gift. it came in perfect shape. And it came with a FREE movie also ,which i was surprised. So i will be buying more movies from Amazon!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|After watching this season on Blu ray I realized that I liked the season better than I thought. When I watched its first run on HBO I didnt love it as much as season 1. But after watching the blu ray through, I can say I shortchanged it. Really love this set.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Like most product that just been created, this one offers a lot of potential for the future. I found it really need to be able to cast netflix or a youtube video onto my TV from my phone and even if my phone gets turned off it doesn't stop playing! Also on my laptop it is really nice to able to cast my browser onto the TV and read my emails or read an article. The only problem with the chrome cast is that if you dont have a decent internet connection you can experience lag on the TV or if your computer isn't currently a semi new computer you will experience a lag or google chrome will fail on your computer, so there is room for improvement. I only recommend this if you are looking to turn your tv into a \\"smart tv\\". however if you already have a media box, there really isn't a need to get this right now. It cannot cast anything well other than Netflix, Youtube, or Google play. It does come with an USB cable to power it if there is no USB on your tv there is a plug for you to use for the wall outlet.
0470876417|4.0|I really liked the way this book was organized and walks you through the various models, attributes and examples of how they are implemented.
B00BS4QP60|3.0|Not bad but not all that good. I am a country purist who has learned to like some of the new style but not most of it as for most of it isn't really country. This album follows the cookie cutter sound that Nashville has created for all of the kiddies. There are a few good tunes and the best songs are only available when you buy the deluxe version. Best song he has done in years is one of the bonus tracks called frame of mine but you will never hear this on the radio because it is a country song and they don't play country music on the radio anymore
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am an adult who enjoyed reading this book that is meant for teenagers. It was interesting to read about an evil and suppressive government forcing innocent children to fight to the death for survival just to prove how superior and powerful it is, and to keep the population in control. While the eventual winner was obvious the change in the rules to allow two winners was a nice twist. I would have preferred more background on the government and how it came to be but I suppose that is for the sequel.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This fifth book in the Outlander series is another fabulous continuation of Claire and Jamie's story. These books are so rich in history, adventure and romance! Amazingly well written and given to exacting details of the events unfolding, you feel as though you are going through everything the characters experience along with them. I highly recommend this outstanding series....it is one of the best I have ever read.
B0037A4ILC|5.0|I was born in 1934 so I mostly know the period of 1940-45 from the point of view of a child.  This film told me what else was going on in the world while we watched the newsreels at the movies about the Nazi regime.  Politics and propaganda gave us a very limited view about others living through the same period.  It's an exciting and educational film and I would recommend it to educators of social studies, language arts, and world language teachers.  I gave this film as a gift to a teacher friend of mine who was a child in Giessen during the war.
030758836X|4.0|This was a very suspenseful,hard to put down book, that I read every night until my eyes were tired. Until the last fifteen pages or so. The ending completely falls apart, its almost like the author had someone else write the ending for her. Still worth reading, but be forewarned, you may be disappointed in how the book ends (or doesn't end).
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I wanted to cry when it was over. I didn't want to leave Cath's world. So many worlds, stories, and characters to miss. All in one book. I hope there is a sequel someday. I need to know what happens with all of them. Every character, there is so much more to explore.<br />Write all the words Rainbow, write many many many more words!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I do like the app, but a big problem with it is that it shut down randomly. I'll be watching a video and it suddenly closes.
B00D82BNLC|5.0|COAST TO COAST PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION: THE JOURNEY UNDERNEATH by CAROLYN BENNETT is a spine tingling book into Greenhurst Hospital. This is a place where the  Coast to Coast Paranormal Investigations encounter their worst fears.<br /><br />Intertwined with the supernatural and  mysterious thrills there are deeper encounters here. I thought this great book was much better than any of the paranormal investigations on television. I was glued to the pages that flowed smoothly and were well written.<br /><br />If you like all things spooky and anything paranormal this is the book for you! Leigh MacLeod is a wonderful character and there really is no way to prepare for all the encounters. (No Spoilers)<br /><br />I received this copy as a gift and hope there will be more from this author. Highly engaging and recommended.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This is one of my most favorite series!  You won't be disappointed in the good read! This author puts out books very quickly so no waiting for the next installment
B000W93CHC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Pillars of the Earth.  Before I read World Without End, I read numerous reviews especially the negative ones. I decided to try a sample. I liked it and just finished reading it. Even though I loved the Cathedral architecture theme of Pillars, I liked WWE as much as Pillars. I enjoyed the complexity of the characters and the story. I especially appreciated the struggle of the women. Their story is a vital yet often ignored part of history. The historical setting was appropriately vivid, detailed, and believable. I did not find much justification for the criticism. There have always been independent thinkers who are ahead of their time.  Some of these people are women! As we know from history, such individuals were often persecuted by the prevailing religion of the day, as heretics and witches.  Why be offended by an accurate description of society.  I was not bothered by complaints of expressions that were not likely used in a particular historical era. I couldn't possibly comprehend a story written in the language of the time. Why wouldn't the story be written with words that let us understand, identify with or vilify the characters!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I have bought this app and I have been having trouble with it every since I've had it. It will not load halve of the time and you have to keep going back to your home page to get back on. I have reinstalled it so many times that I decided not to have it any more.  Also on kindle fire you cannot play Facebook games and th a t sucks.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|this was truly an amazing book and an even more amazing series I suggest reading the rest of the series.

B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Great game just, like Bloxorz and Factory Balls, if you hop on a computer and google one of the games, it's online for free. But other than that I love the game.
B00BUKODDO|5.0|The tunes as written have the complexity you expect in improvisations, while the solos grow out of the music and sound as though they might have been written.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's a very calming game, keeps my baby quiet for a long time and she's two! I also like playing it.....very soothing background music.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|its so amazing.  this app; Alarm Cock Xtreme Free does something so few things out there actually do anymore...its job.
B00C5R8364|2.0|Couldn't care less about major characters. Story like most others of the gendre. Forsyth seems to be living on his reputation. Have read better books by no name authors.
0399159347|1.0|I was in for a \\"GREAT READ\\" and was sorely disappointed.  To me they were just a bunch of sick characters ... I wasn't the least bit \\"entertained\\" and it sure wasn't a page turner.  I found the book BORING and sorry I wasted even five minutes reading it.  Sorry but this is my opinion but apparently a lot of people loved it.  Also, if you are an older person or one with poor eyesight, you might need a magnifying glass ... that's how small the print is.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I am finding this new game challenging and addictive. It really gives my brain a workout, each game requires 15 to 30 minutes for me, reqjuiring much more strategy and much less luck than ordinary solitaire.  Thank you for the distraction!
B007AL48UK|5.0|I hate waiting for ppl but with this game I don't mind so much. It's a great little time killer.
1781162646|5.0|This book, by Stephen King, is more like and old time mystery novel. No monsters, aliens, vampires, killer diseases. Just a fun read as you piece together clues that surface while the main character spends his summer working at an amusement park, healing a broken-heart, making new friends and learning to wear the fur. This book is pretty tame for a King novel, however, the story is well told and the characters and the setting grow on you. I found the book to be an enjoyable read that kept me turning the pages right up until the very last. The story flows quickly and before you know it you are faced with a puzzling crime, a storm, a mysterious phone call, a face-off and a couple of head-scratching twists that all add up to a true who-done-it and a really good read. I only wish King had done more work in this genre. I judge a book by how I feel when I am finished and close the cover. Joyland is a book that left me satisfied, but wanting more. Stephen King is a masterful writer who took me back to the 1970's, when I was the age of the main character. A time that was familiar and rich with memories. A time when life seemed less complicated. That is, until we uncover a murder. Well done, Mr. King.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It teaches children  budgeting and care for their special dragons! I love this app because it mixes  Creativity and real life skills and  care!
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love the cast. Great characters and great writers. Alexis's and Castle are my favorite characters. I wish she was a bigger part of the show.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I've been away from using Opera for some time now. I remember it was great for my old Windows Phone. It still looks and functions perfectly, but it takes a bit of &#34;getting used to&#34; after using other browsers for a few years.

B0000CESR7|5.0|I really underestimated this cycle when I first bought it, though I'm not sure why. I was immediately attracted to Chailly's 6th, however, and after more listening, I think that his outstanding 6th exemplifies the strengths of the set. Chailly's approach features melodicism with flowing tempos and the ability to draw significant contrasts within a movement, while still maintaining cohesiveness and forward momentum. I think the performances here are of consistently high quality. Most of these are recorded with the world-class Concertgebouw orchestra, which seems secure and confident in its delivery, and the Concertgebouw hall has exceptional acoustics. The recording sets the orchestra naturally within that acoustic. But by the standards of some more recent recordings, which are often closely miked or spotlit, the sound may seem slightly distant. I believe that may be the one real drawback to this set, but it simply requires a little accommodation by the listener.<br /><br />Anyway it seems that this is among the best Bruckner cycles, and more consistent in quality than, say, Jochum's two traversals on DGG and EMI. I do wish that Chailly would have recorded the original, uncut version of the 3rd, but I'm not sure any complete Bruckner cycle includes it. It seems to only be available on single discs (there are good ones by Nott, Nagano, and even Norrington.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I think this app has everything I need to access PDF files on the go using my tablet. Great work
1410429385|1.0|I have read several of the Jack Reacher novels (out of order) and have enjoyed everyone until I got to this one. This book is awful and actually painful to get through. If you are interested in starting to read the series do not start with this one, in fact never even read this one. There are several parts of the book that make absolutely no sense at all, weak sauce altogether. This one was phoned in. Laughable.
B005R32L66|5.0|Yes there are a lot of other apps that do the same thing, but Skype is still my favorite, for both personal and professional use.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Exceedingly well written about a depressing subject.  The point of view from those without names was intriguing. Well worth the time.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This is the best game I have tried in a long time.  It is challenging and keeps me wanting to play more and more.<br /><br />Love it
B00CPLGGXM|4.0|Performed over expectations. Fast, great performance, and best of all hundreds of dollars cheaper than the nearest comparable Intel. Handles all my games with ease (also got an hd 7950 handling graphics) and soon to be combined with an ssd. Best bang for the money they're asking for. Recommending this for any first time gaming builds.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|reminds me of the old super Mario bros game but with some differences. A very enjoyable game and easy to play.
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|Been listening to these guys since Constellations and was totally pleased with Rescue and Restore. It has the sound of Messengers and Constellations mix together with trumpets thrown into the mix. Really great album that shows these guys have matured as a band and continue to push the envelope and evolve as a band.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is the first book that I have gifted to anyone, much less more than one person.  Not only is it well written, but a smooth, easy read as well.  On top of everything, it delivers.  It delivers a message of hope, and it offers easy ways to change and improve your life.  Pam Grout is a blessing that my friends and family will be grateful for in years to come.
159514188X|2.0|Thirteen Reasons Why - a parents review.<br /><br />My son came home after an evening with some friends saying the kids were talking about this book - it was required reading in one of their classes. We homeschool so it wasn't required for my son. However, after he heard the kids talking about it, he was intrigued and asked if he could read it.<br /><br />I thought it over and reasoned that because we lost a very close family member to suicide a short time ago, because I knew my son to still be struggling with the loss, because my son was 16, able to make his own decisions for the most part and because I thought it might be helpful for him to reconcile the loss, I said yes - before I read it.<br /><br />Had I read the book first, I would not have allowed my son to read it. And here is why...<br /><br />It glorifies suicide. I know there are many that would argue this case. However, this is my biggest complaint with the book. Having lost someone in the family this way, I have seen FIRST HAND the contagious effect it has on people. I have watched the repercussions snowball until all sense of normalcy is gone. You see, when someone dies, even in a suicide, it is common to remember the good and forget the bad. It is common to cover the suicide with gentle euphemisms and only highlight all that is lovely. And so, as is the case, it causes a chain reaction. People begin to wonder if others would say the same nice things about them. People tend to envy the \\"attention\\" the deceased person is getting.<br /><br />Although the character Clay obviously was upset about how Hannah went about things and obviously didn't want her to die, I felt this whole book was set up in a way that glorified the act.<br /><br />This was done through the CONSTANT blaming of other people for her woes. At the end, she accepted a couple of major mistakes but for the most part, she blamed everything on just a few people. The author kept referring to it as \\"the snowball effect.\\" It all started with one stupid high school freshman making a mistake and snowballed into her ruined life. With the cassette tapes Hannah left behind, she told that kid he started it all.<br /><br />Now, I know this is just a story but let me get a little personal here. Having someone you love and care about kill themselves is something you will NEVER get over. You will probably blame yourself for the rest of your life - filling your head with \\"what ifs\\" and \\"if onlys\\" - so the LAST thing someone needs is for another person to blame them. It would ruin someone's life. I understand what the author is trying to do here... you never really know how your actions effect another person. But I would not recommend someone reading this who has lost someone to suicide because it will make them think about all the things they could've and should've done. Forever. And guess what, regardless of what studies stay, there is really no way to stop someone once their mind is made up. And, as in our case, when someone knows the \\"danger signs\\" they tend to outsmart them anyway.<br /><br />There was SO MUCH BLAMING in this book. I felt it promoted victimization. Don't get me wrong. Suicide is a very real problem and we need a solution. We need to be kind to each other. I just didn't feel that this book helped promote kindness. In fact, I felt it promoted the opposite.<br /><br />The character, Hannah, wasn't trying to make a difference or help someone. She was trying to hurt people. Plain and simple. She wanted to ruin their lives like she felt they ruined hers. She said mean and hurtful things. She exposed secrets (some of which should have been exposed to the police) and she didn't hope for anything good for them. Except Clay.<br /><br />Hannah says somewhere in the book that she begins to wonder what people would do if she just never came back. Then she goes on to send 13 people on a meaningless journey around the town. There really was no point to walking around looking at her old stomping grounds. Otherthan to glorify the act. She wanted people to care. She wanted to make them sorry for what they did for her. And she wanted them to respond in just a certain way. And at least one of the characters did just what she wanted.<br /><br />For someone considering suicide, if they feel like people really will do all those things they fantasize about, they are going to be more likely to follow through. I know that sounds heartless but think about it. A person who is considering this needs desperate help. That's a given. No one, in his or her right mind, would even consider this. So they are not thinking rationally to begin with. If they think that people really do all the things they imagine, it will only further solidify their case. The author could have done it better here with the same tapes and yet having the character refuse to go around town... not giving in to her last wish.<br /><br />One of the reviews referred to this book as being hopeful. I would have to completely and whole-heartedly disagree. Until the last few paragraphs of the book, when Clay reaches out to an outcast, you only know of all the horrible, rotten breaks this poor girl got. I would guess many of us have experienced similar incidents in high school and, yeah, its awful. But to set out to hurt people because of that? To leave behind, as your last request, something that would hurt others... where is the hope in that?<br /><br />Even though Hannah acknowledges that she is giving up, even though Clay keeps \\"thought-speaking\\" to her to NOT do it. I am concerned it still gives the reader the idea that suicide is an option. Other than Clay crying and a few remarks of people looking awful there is no indication to the utter devastation that this act has on a family, friends and even a community. All the emphasis was on Hannah and how unfair her life was.<br /><br />Another thing that I, as a parent, just hated was the fact that all these kids felt like they couldn't share any of this with an adult. Nobody. Clay stayed away from home all night, lying to his mom, to listen to the tapes. The thought of bringing an adult into it was out of the question. But you know what?? Kids need to know there are adults they CAN trust. It would have been better for the author to not even make mention of that than to point out the need to stay away from home, parents and all other adults.<br /><br />The language, while probably being true to the high school experience, was offensive to me. In my opinion, a truly talented author can create an authentic experience without having to reduce their writing to curse words. As if the language wasn't bad enough, we get to \\"witness\\" a rape in the story as well as a first sexual experience. This doesn't even count all the talk of making out, petting, grabbing, etc, etc. The author could have brought us to the point of understanding without having to describe the way Hannah's panties rolled as Bryce fingered her waist. We also don't need to know that his finger went in and out or that her breasts showed under her wet bra. To me, this is just lazy writing. It is possible to bring the reader to the point of understanding without having to describe it. Yes, these were pivotal points in Hannah's life, but it was not necessary to go into so much detail.<br /><br />In the end, I understand what the author was attempting here. And yes, there will be many who are helped through this book. Perhaps there are those who are selfish & hurtful that can be touched by this.<br /><br />That being said, I cannot recommend this book. At all.  I think I could forgive the language and explicitness... but I honestly felt this book promoted victimization, condoned retaliation, and glorified suicide.<br /><br />I can't believe this is REQUIRED reading in our local school district. Just one of a million other reasons why I homeschool.

0385528787|5.0|This is the third book in a set, and if you haven't read the other two, I would suggest that you do that first before picking up this one.  The other two are written to compliment one another, but you could read either one first and be ok.  This is definitely meant to be a third book.  It's everything I wanted it to be.  It has the best fictional play of real environmental and social issues that I've ever read.  Margaret Atwood's socio-political satire is always thought provoking, but these three books are my favorite.  I would even recommend reading at least portions of these fictional works in environmental social science classes that are typically heavy in non-fiction.  Scientists aren't the only people in the world who theorize about the future of humanity.

B008JFUO4U|3.0|Story line was ok but entire movie was too digitized.  Not your typical Cruise movie. Slightly dissappointing but I guess it was ok.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|this book was enjoyable to read and kept my attention.  if you enjoy WWII stories, you'll really like this one.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|Say, you like zombies?  Well Mr. Pitt heads up a good Z movie. It is intense with a lot of action packed and suspenseful scenes.
B00821OX98|5.0|Refreshing actors who were good in their roles<br />Good story line<br />Lots of action and suspense<br />Left me wanting to hurry and watch the next week's episode
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|If you're an anglophile, and enjoy the dashing and charming Hugh Grant, you should sample this romantic comedy.  Julia Roberts plays the most famous movie actress of the day, Anna Scott, who happens to visit William Thacker's (Hught Grant's) quaint Notting Hill travel bookstore on Portobello Road.  Later they run into each other, literally, and there is some attraction.  However, their lifestyles are clearly not in sync.<br /><br />Will true love overcome these difficulties?  This movie is quite humorous and provides insight into the challenges of being famous.  What's fun about the movie, besides the characters, is the authentic Notting Hill setting where the film was filmed.  And the interiors of some of the hotels used in the movie are delicious - it's a visual delight.  It's very entertaining when you want to escape to London and see the life and love of a movie star and her unknown bookstore owner. 4.5 stars
0486219577|2.0|This book looked promising but did not deliver. It had two pages of instruction, with minimal text, if any. However, if you are seeking pictures, this delivers.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I found this book difficult to put down. It is not an enjoyable, happy read, but it holds you. I was invested in the characters, I cared about them and am impressed by the author who brought them to life.
B00BV0FK58|4.0|Excellent book. I loved it, however I believe it could have shown a greater variety of couples. I would like to have seen couples from different ethnic backgrounds. Love is expressed differently in different cultures. I know some may be opposed to this but there are same sex couples in the military! They should be included and welcome in marriage discussions like this one.<br /><br />Other than that, I feel almost everyone can pull a little something from this book. It's a quick read, but if you want to truly digest it I will probably take you a few days. I read the book in two hours this first go round then I read it in about two days with intense note taking and journaling.<br /><br />I really hope I can get my husband to read this. As a new army wife, this book was a great help after reading the singles version of this book. I'm definitely going to recommend  this book to my friends and review it on my website.<br /><br />Read it, study it, and take what you need from it. Marriage is about love and communication no single book can solve all of your problems.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I love it because I can listen to my books and my music without killing space on my kindle - the cloud is easy and very practical for someone who wants access to all their stuff.
B00005JO9J|5.0|In order to enjoy any other season of this magnificent show one has to begin with season one.  With season one you get to know the main characters and decide which character you will look forward to seeing in future episodes.  I was never a fan of medical shows but Grey's Anatomy has me hooked.  I have not missed a single episode since Season One Episode One.  Watching the show on DVD is so much better because you get to skip the commercials and you get a lot of uncut versions of some of the episodes. What I found interesting was that the price was remarkably low.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Just a fun app to play around with and pass time - it is just fun and funny-I like it
B00AX6KNOY|4.0|I'm sure most teenagers fantasize about their teachers, either as love objects or monsters.  The Facility is a great fantasy come<br />true on the screen.  Sci-Fi, aliens, horror, fans will like this entertaining movie.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Writing a review for the Goodfellas? Please. I could do this forever but don't have the time. Naturally, this is a great movie. Being able to watch it on my Kindle was incredible and seemed so much like a privilege- if you don't have Amazon Prime (I know this is supposed to be about the movie but it speaks for itself) you should get Prime - the movie selections are incredible and I love being able to pull up one when I have to wait. I've been thinking about canceling cable to be honest.
B00280LYHS|5.0|BEST ACTION BOOK EVER NEXT TO THE HUNGERGAMES!!!I love it so much!!! I wish every book was like this bcause it is so awesome!!!
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Just a fun app to play with when you get tired of doodling or waiting around or when the kids need something to occupy their time during long waits
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. I'm thirteen and I thought I was so touching. I think about how hard it was to lose those things and now I love life so much more.
B004GYY714|5.0|Dad can get baseball at the Casino! TV at casino (only go for pops) doesn't play Braves so now he can listen or watch on the kindle - at least get the scores
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am so addicted to this bingo game! This is my &#34;woosah&#34; to the end of my day! Some of the changes haven't been my favorite, but what can you do. Keep the fun coming and I will continue to be a fan!!!!! *:)
B00AB7HESI|3.0|The game will always be fun, but I was expecting better soundtracks and more freedom like in Scribblenauts unlimited on the PC
1401322786|4.0|Yes, Mitch Albom has a familiar theme to all of his books and that's exactly why I love to read him. This particular book was a gift for my mom who also enjoyed it very much.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition doesnt deliver as many mechanics as the regular Minecraft, and the exploration is very limited. I had to create 3 or 4 worlds to even get a cave
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend who have me no detail except that I would like it. The story is one that really pulls you in as if you are experiencing every emotion with Hazle and Gus. It's a romantic love story, one which I never expected. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a deeper read. Loved it.
B00CTT9646|4.0|I have been a life long trekkie and have given Mr Abrams et al the benefit of the doubt and taken his films on their own merits and thoroughly enjoyed both thus far. Yes one or two points have been an irritant to the purist in my opinion but I have enjoyed the fact that these films are set in an alternate timeline and enjoy them for the value that they contribute to Trek in total and remember that they are keeping Trek alive for us all to enjoy. As for the Bluray and phaser set, I was concerned reading some negative comments regarding the quality of the build of the phaser replica, because to be honest, that was the main reason for my ordering from Amazon and not waiting an extra week for the NZ release. I am happy to say that the quality of the phaser that I received was excellent and up to the same standard as the previous QMX phaser released after the 2009 film, so I assume that unfortunately there are some faulty replicas that have slipped through quality control. Over all as a customer I am very pleased with the Amazon service, the packaging was well done and the package arrived on my doorstep half a world away from origin point well ahead of the promised deadline, well done Amazon, thank you.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Star Trek: Into Darkness Bowling for Movie Score - 299.25 of 300 (WOWZA, that's nearly a perfect score!)<br /><br />Hello out there in Amazon land - this is a kind of special Bowling for Movies Review.  As some of you doubtless know, I have been using my totally unique and completely un-patentable mixture of old technology, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and quasi/pseudo-science to rate and score movies.  Basically, the idea is I rate and score movies from the vantage point of The Regular Dudes of the world - something I find missing in other for pay services or the so called \\"movie critic\\" professionals.  Frankly, who you gonna believe - some out of touch guy who gets paid per word or me, just your average dude who watches too many movies?  Hey, they may be able to claim themselves as \\"experts\\" but experts at what I ask you.  Now me, I just have access to hundreds and hundreds of movies across all formats and genres and a deep love of hearing myself talk... basically the only two things one might need to give an accurate view if you will, of Hollywood magic - and all conveniently laid out for you, dear Amazon review reader, in an easy to interpret format - the humble bowling score.  Furthermore, the system can be trusted because it literally has nothing to do with actual bowling (and isn't that just great for your peace of mind or POM for those into the whole brevity thing).<br /><br />Now while I have a sort of template I generally use when writing movie reviews when a movie is a true gem (and let me assure you, this movie IS A PURE AND TRUE GEM) I have vowed to write a completely new review.  While the review is a one of a kind, the system is not - a bowling score of 108 would be considered, eh - it was ok; while a 192 would truly be a good movie - one you might recommend to friends; now crack 200 and you've got something - and by thunder - this be one heck of a great popcorn movie.<br /><br />Star Trek: Into Darkness - we own the super cool 3D Blu Ray with official Starfleet phaser version (I added a picture to the `customer images') - seriously people if you don't have a 3D TV, get one - it seriously ramps up the OMG factor and why else would you watch a movie if not for the OMG factor?<br /><br />What's the movie about?<br />(Ok, I am gonna try my best here to give you what you need without spoiling any of the good parts, so bear with me here.)<br /><br />When questionable judgment leads the crew of the Enterprise into some \\"oops, did I do that?\\" kind of trouble (prime directive, prime smekertive, oh, wait, you're serious) Jim Kirk loses his beloved Enterprise and is busted down to commander.  Meanwhile, there is trouble afoot when a top secret installation laying hidden in plain sight as a library is blown up in the WAY TO COOL FOR SCHOOL looking London (circa 2259) Starfleet gathers its best and brightest - only to have them blown away at the hands of the mysterious John Harrison - yup, you guessed it, the same dude responsible for blowing up the building in London town.  It's up to Kirk and crew to put an end to this renegade's shenanigans, uncover the mystery of Section 31, get a good look at J.J. Abrams version of what a Klingon looks like, and find out what the Enterprise is really made of.  WOW, trying NOT to give away anything is not as easy as it would seem.  People, there are some SERIOUS twists and turns along the way and at least one OOOH MMMY GOOODDDD moment... I had 3 of those myself, but individual results may vary.<br /><br />Why I loved this movie so much:<br />&lt;> Total popcorn movie - action, adventure, comedy, good friends, tonight is kind of special sort of movie that keep me going from beginning to end - there was no `heavy, middle of the movie' type dialog quagmire - the movie just spilled from one scene to the next without slowing down<br />&lt;> The special effects were simply put - amazing.  So often with CGI-dependent movies the action on screen comes off as cartoonish (at best) which can really negate the viewer's immersion, not the case here; I am for positive that the 3D helped out in this department as space debris littered my living room, spears whizzed by my head, and you could see to infinity (maybe even beyond) which really ramped up the feeling that you were genuinely in space<br />&lt;> While it is this Movie Dude's opinion that The Prime Directive is simply awesome (I mean really, how many of the world's ills could have been avoided if one culture didn't try to change, covert, or otherwise \\"make better, for your own good\\" anyone else's culture); Gene Roddenberry was a true hero and humanitarian way back in the 60's when he created a show which featured such novel ideas as equality of the races, the abolishment of nationalism in favor of a worldview without borders, and a `hands off' to cultural conversions by way of respectful intellectual tolerance<br />&lt;> The blending of old Star Trek mythos into a new Star Trek package... dude, you have NO IDEA how bad I want to just tell you what happens but that would be SPOILING the movie for you, trust The Movie Dude here - they did just that and they did it well<br />&lt;> The script feature some wonderful interplay between the core characters of Kirk, Spock, and Uhura which further developed the characters in a significantly more intimate way not previously seen in any other franchise offering<br /><br />Why I didn't give the movie a perfect score:<br />&lt;> It just missed a perfect score for a few small reasons - first, the villain in our story, while wonderfully acted by Benedict Cumberbatch (say that three times fast with crackers in your mouth), true Trekkies may stumble on the apparent `whitewashing' of the character<br />&lt;> I may be alone in this but - ever since the Terror Attacks of 9/11, Hollywood has seemed completely and overtly obsessed with producing films which show the utter annihilation of skyscrapers, usually in some dramatic collapse - enough is enough already, move on to some other disasters will you Hollywood... will ya?<br /><br />Beyond that, dude, I seriously have NOTHING to complain about.  The movie had a quick pace, a solid (if slightly predictable) plot, all the action and adventure you could shake a stick at (which I can shake a stick at quite a lot), all the love interests, scandals, blowing stuff up, Star Ships battling it out, and a gratuitous scene with a blond in her underwear one Movie Dude could ask for... kudos to you Mr. Abrams, kudos to you.<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Love this game, I downloaded it for my children but find myself playing g it more than them. It is very relaxing.
B008HJGPVO|3.0|Looks nice, but I found it to be heavy for its size.  Also I think it is a bit pricey too!  I would  NEVER spend good money on it again.  Since ordering this one I have ordered and received the multi pack of zebra striped stylus pens and like them much better...
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love the game very fun to play when you are bored.I love it does not take long to wait to upgrade the buildings
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|excellent thriller, easy free flowing realistic story with not too many characters, The plot in the story leads to an exciting conclusion.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good job! This is a great app!! The graphics are true and it keeps you entertained for hours. The only thing I would change is a better tutorial
140006922X|5.0|What I truly enjoyed about this book is it taught me about Jesus the man who lived in a very turbulent time. I learned he had brothers and sisters like real human beings do, but since I went to a catholic school, they never mentioned his siblings because that would have taken away from the churches message that he was the son of god, who was told to die on a cross for people to have their sins removed. God wasn't married, therefore he did not have other children for Jesus to grow up with. And lastly I did learn that the bible keeps acting
B00E6890RG|5.0|This amazing prog rock band has not reached their peak.  They continue to get better and more innovative with each release.  The Mountain will easily be one of the best, if not the best progressive rock album of 2013.  Cockroach King is one of the best prog songs I've heard in many years.  Buy this album, you will not be disappointed.
0439813786|4.0|Part children's book, part comic book, part graphic novel, and part picture book, The Invention of Hugo Cabret cannot be simplified into any single one of these genres. A beautifully written and illustrated book, this book was the 2007 winner of the Caldecott medal, an award specific to the illustrations in a children's book. However, the book is not a typical `picture book.' Instead, the illustrations take over the story at times, detailing the action in rich drawings that leave no want for more words. Author John Selznick skillfully navigates the intersectional nature that the book demonstrates.<br /> After his father's death and his uncle's disappearance, twelve-year-old Hugo Cabret lives hidden within the walls of a Parisian train station, spending his days keeping the clocks running seamlessly to prevent the Station Master from putting him in an orphanage. The only bright spot in his life is the Automaton: a mechanical man that his father was repairing before his untimely death. With the help of his father's old notebook, Hugo sets upon the task of rebuilding the automaton. Hugo believes that the automaton, which is posed in a seated position poised to write, carries a message from his dead father, telling him where to go and how to live his life from this point. In order to help his progress in repairing the automaton, he resorts to stealing from a toy booth; and gets caught by the owner of the booth, a crotchety old man, and is made to work off his debt. With this begins the adventure of a lifetime, involving new friends, a stolen notebook, the beauty of silent cinema, and a mystery that has lasted at least a decade.
B003B02O0A|5.0|The second time that I have read this book.  The first time I have ever read a book twice!  One of my favorite books ever!  I can't wait for Sycamore Row!!!!!!!
B00E3UN44W|5.0|Imagine my joy researching Google to find that there is a season 3 of Sherlock Holmes starring Benedict Cumberbatch.<br />I have watched season 1 and 2 on Netflix and have fallen in love with this most extraordinary sleuth. How he survives the ending of season 2 will be a treat to see.  I will not disclose the ending so u who have not seen this marvelous detective show will run to get the 2 seasons. The star, Benedict, is most engaging and besides being very cute gets us hooked on his genius. I see that season 3 is a preorder and my heart wilts thinking I will not immediately be able to plug him in my DVD player... Oh excruciating wait!!!!!!!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I got this BEFORE the season ended on PBS and was stunned by the end. The season of losses and beginnings.  I was not ready for them but in some ways.. true to life and nothing should be taken for granted.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use the widget on my S4 &amp; it works perfectly.  I originally used a different app which didn't recognize my town,  which is a suburb of Houston.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Sad loosing this wonderful voice. She shines here with so many of her record making hits... bitter sweet. The duet with R Kelly is really touching.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put this book down! Loved it! I cannot wait to get into the next book and see what happens next!
B0018M6J90|5.0|All the cast shine in this sweet tender fun film in the style of the old Hollywood romantic comedies of the 30's and 40's! Frances is wonderful as Miss Pettigrew, Amy gives a pitch perfect performance as the femme fatale.. her crowning moment is in her delivery of the song \\"If I didn't Care\\".... charming, sweet and a bit wicked in a good fun way!!  Miss Pettigrew does have her day!!
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Powerful and memorable movie.  Benigni deserved the Oscar he won.  Even if you don't like movies with subtitles, this is worth watching

New charaters introduced as the abby residents deal with the war and the result of the wars impact on them all.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This simply does it all! Trust me the got it right on this little thing, get one before the lock down all the potential it can do! Simply put WOW! Amazing!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|She doesn't work as advertised.  False advertisement. Half the time the info requested is not available.  When the answers didn't come I upgraded to the paid version and it still doesn't work.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|I personally think this is the Best game ever! It is so fun, I really can't put my Kindle Fire HD down.  When I started I thought it was easy but it's hard.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps you guessing. Enjoying it so far. Good game. Something new. Keeps my mind guessing. Great memory game. Thank you for creating
0307352153|5.0|I consider myself to be introverted, but not shy. I don't have problems speaking with people, but I \\"recharge my batteries\\" by being alone and doing things by myself. This always confused me because I thought that introverted people are automatically shy and socially awkward. This book helped me to realize that there are different degrees of being introverted, and I feel very enlightened after reading it.<br /><br />Our polarizing society paints pictures with Sharpie markers, without subtlety. People are classified as being either shy or outgoing, with nothing allowed in between. \\"Quiet\\" presents a more balanced analysis at how introverts and extroverts interact with the world and with each other. Neither outlook is presented as superior, but they are compared and contrasted with a view to understanding each other. I appreciate that I more fully understand my own tendencies and I can greater empathize with extroverted people. If that sounds like a fun activity for you, then I would wholeheartedly recommend this book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game it's super addictive I wish they hadn't changed the power ups but you can't complain when something is free
0812550757|5.0|Ender's Game was an exciting sci-fi action story, and I enjoyed it very much. Speaker for the Dead is a sequel with a VERY different (Philosophical) tone, and for this reason it can be polarizing among readers of Ender's Game. Imagine if instead of making \\"Empire Strikes Back,\\" the sequel to \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" was a space-detective/mystery that examined the ethical ramifications of the events of the first movie. The style is jarringly different. If you're willing to stay along for the ride, you will be rewarded as the \\"Ender's Game\\" universe gets bigger and bigger.<br /><br />(A note about book's use of religion: I don't subscribe to Card's religious beliefs, but as a work of fiction, it doesn't bother me that religion plays a role in the \\"Ender's Game\\" universe. It is never preachy, and religion is used simply as an element in the story that plays a role, no different than any other object or concept.)
B0040I09RM|4.0|Crazy show, excellent plot and something wild always happens at the end of the show. We're just getting started with the seasons.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Much like a magic trick, this movie is very flashy, flamboyant and confident about itself. The cat-and-mouse game that happens between the different groups of characters was entertaining and the elaborate set pieces were impressive and flashy. The only thing that broke the suspension of disbelief are modern movie conventions: hip young kids are geniuses and adults are dumb, all of the handsome and beautiful actors and actresses are witty at just the right time, improbable \\"Hollywood hacking,\\" etc. It felt like I was watching the execution of a math equation written by movie execs called \\"Clean, summer heist movie featuring stage magic.\\" It is predictably sleek and clever, but I guess that's what one should expect from this kind of a movie. I plan on watching this with my teenage nephew in the hospital, and I KNOW he will have a blast. For what it's worth, I'm glad this exists.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Well the tenth season continues to be incredible.  As always sound and video are good.  The story lines are getting a little more personal as the characters have to develop.<br /><br />As always NCIS is worth the money.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I believe this is one of the greatest shows ever created so much so that I have purchased all 5 complete seasons thru the Amazon Marketplace. This show has it all, Mystery/crime,Drama, comedy and Romance. Rick Castle is a famous Author who writes murder mysteries, Kate Beckett is one of NYC finest police detectives. When they first meet Rick was so impressed with her he talks to his friend the mayor and gets to team with Kate Beckett. Every episode is filled with unique twists, after Kate Beckett gets adjusted to Rick Castle's unique slant on crime solving the form a great crime solving team, then a friendship, a partnership, and now a couple. You cannot go wrong if you want something that can entertain you over and over again without getting old.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app. is my favorite.  It is easy to use and make notes for future references.  Love,Love, Love this app.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I found it very disjointed and couldn't keep track of the who was who.  Our book club was not impressed with this book.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I spent some time reading through the whole series, and I thought is was well written and interesting.  I will be interested to see how the movie in November measures up.
B00EOO55GW|1.0|These guys, again, produce an album full of unoriginal trash that they ripped from other bands, and people are still gullible enough to think they are some amazing musical talent.  Just goes to show you how ignorant today's generation of rock fans truly are.
B000002J5K|5.0|I love this C.D.  I play it all the time.  Lots of old blues tunes and great artists from Motown...............(Aretha sings &#34;THINK&#34;)..........great to hear the upbeat &#34;Gospels&#34; on it too............brought back memories of the original film..................Ya' can't sit down and listen to this...........ya' gotta' get up and &#34;jump&#34;!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not my cup of tea. It became pretty predictable after the first few chapters. I failed to see what all the hoopla is over 50 Shades of Grey.
B00AA36RZY|5.0|Very easy read and very informative. One of the best descriptions of a technical subject. Can't stop reading, finished in two days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Absolutely loved it..Couldnt put it down...Full of suspense and always keeps you guessing about what's next..Can't wait to see movie.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A very good book, but not as good as the other two. Some parts dragged a bit, but a good read nonetheless.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|All the songs are wonderful.  So glad I discovered this group.  The Wicked album is also wonderful. Highly recommended.<br />x
B009F7ORQW|5.0|What a fun car this will be to complete any Barbie play house, hours of fun for anyone who loves Barbie.
B000002GJH|5.0|This is an album from'91,featuring future bands Pearl Jam & Soundgarden members(Vedder,Ament,McCready,etc...),and this is a great CD!!!You can hear grunge evolve right here.Be blown away by this music,do yourself a favor and give a listen.
B005XLN97M|5.0|What is a vacation home without a beach home too, love it, will make a nice addition to the Barbie town we are creating.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This is a fun game with falling blocks in the mode of Tetris. The blocks fill up the bottom of the screen, but when a row is completely filled it is cleared. As in Tetris, you try to clear the rows fast enough to keep the screen from filling up to the top, in which case it's game over. Slydris differs from Tetris in that you can slide pieces from side to side after they have already landed. And the game waits while you decide which piece to slide, before dropping the next group of pieces. This makes it more of a strategy game than a quick finger test. Also you can move a piece itself or you can move another piece below it and let the first one fall into its place. Take as much time as you want to figure out what to do, but be aware that any long-term strategy that takes more than a few moves may be foiled by the next group of falling blocks.  And things are complicated further by special blocks that either refuse to move or to fall, or cause other blocks to break apart.<br />Game play and controls are fine, since all you have to do is touch a block and move it to the side. You get a few choices of music and color scheme, and a couple of variations on the game mode as well.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Just the right amount of history and mystery. The characters were well developed and the plot kept me interested the entire time.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Loads of fun, lots of action.  This one is great for the kiddies as well as the old folks.  Good physics and realistic action.  The scenery is beautiful.  This definitely a 5 star game.  CHEERS!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This is just an awesome movie.  You don't even have to be a \\"Trekie\\" to appreciate it.  I will say that having some Trek historical knowledge is helpful, but not necessary to the full enjoyment of this action thriller.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really like how the objects move throughout the same rooms. You remember where it was located the last time you were in this room but it has moved. It keeps the game interesting.
1603427244|5.0|Glad that I purchased this book. It's very well organized with different sections. Nice and clear pictures with well written and easily understand instructions.  Never know there're that many different ways of cast on and bind off. Thanks very much to the author.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was offended by the constant use of the &#34;F&#34; word.  I did like the use of the diary technique.  Even though I very soon realized Amy was not dead, there were still a lot of surprises.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Love it I don't know what I do with out it love all of the thing it can do it the loudest one they have
0307341550|3.0|I was a huge fan of Gone Girl, so I decided to check out Gillian Flynn's other novels, beginning with Sharp Objects. I'll admit, it took me quite a while to get invested in this one (whereas Gone Girl had me right from the beginning). Many parts of this story are unnecessarily disturbing and off-putting, but most of the darkness is warranted because of the nature of the characters and their lives. My biggest complaint about this book was that the plot was incredibly slow to build, which left all the momentum kind of trapped awkwardly at the end of the book. If the entire book had been as riveting as the last 60 pages, it would have been a five star review for sure! All in all, I'm glad I read it and I thoroughly enjoyed the story as a whole. If you are struggling through the first 100 pages, know that you are not alone and that it will get better. Hang in there!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is fun. it keeps me guessing the combinations are clever and sometimes tricky. provides several hours of non-stop fun.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very fun not really easy and that is good. I sometimes can't figure out how to do some tasks. But if you keep at it you can do it.<br />Lynnae
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish there were more floors but other than that a great mind game to start out on.I love the challenge and how they have them set up.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love this app. Keeps me entertained for hours and you can always try and beat your own score. I would recommend for any age. My grandkids love it too.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I have been hooked on this show from the first episode.  Love the characters and how complicated they can be.  Looking forward to Season 4 when Alicia and Carey start their own law firm.  Exciting!  Can't wait.
140006922X|5.0|This author accomplished what I would have loved to do.  His 20 year research provided the answers to so many of my questions about who the historical Jesus was and proves that most of the stories in the Bible are not to be believed.  It has reaffirmed my belief that the Bible contains mostly misinformation and outright fallacies than any of us could imagine.  I read it once and now I am pouring through it again.  I'd like to thank Reza Aslan for what he has done for all of us.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The story is developed in way that leads you down the path or journey.  Is it faith or blind faith?  How do you meet unexpected difficulties?  How much are you willing to risk?  Is it your journey?
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I finally got ALL of the Sci-Fi Gems that sustained me through my junior and senior years of Glendale High School. Beam Me Up, Scotty!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game!  Kept coming back til I could solve the puzzle!  It was really made me look at things differently!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|So well casted, filmed, fine fine choice of actresses and actors. Dude has Spock down! And who knew he and Uhuru had a THANG! Nice tough there. And it was Dark at times, which spoke to the Vietnam Veteran in me. Superbly done film.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This was a different kind of book at first. It started with several different characters and just added the action to make it very interesting. Had to keep reading it and it was hard to put down,.
1250029465|5.0|The book itself was in Great condition. Pretty good story in the book too. I would recommend it to a friend.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great second book for City of Bones. It continued on from the last page of the first book without missing a beat.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Always enjoyed Pac Man, now I can play it again on my Kindle . Enjoy it a lot , so did my grandson .
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|A zombie movie that's a little more on the light-hearted side with a touch of teen romance. A fun flick with dome cool special effects that will get some laughs.
